8884893,comment,8883643,8884527,0,0,owenfi,,,"Definitely not a lawyer but it seems that way to me.<p>Also a lot of the state laws seem to &quot;allow&quot; fees that are blatantly disallowed. (Alabama, search fee of $5; Arkansas, Retrieval fee for offsite records; California, clerical costs in locating...)<p>From page 14 of HITECH it outlines precedence vs state laws. It usually sides with the individual (it defers to state law when state law gives more privacy/access rights). On fees, the QA period that preceded the finalization of HITECH explicitly disallows retrieval fees and has more explanation on what constitutes &quot;reasonable fees&quot;.<p>The &quot;RFC&quot; [1] says on pages 70-71 of the pdf:<p>&quot;With respect to providing a copy (or summary or explanation) of protected health information from an EHR in electronic form, however, section 13405(e)(2) of the HITECH Act provides that a covered entity may not charge more than its labor costs in responding to the request for the copy.&quot;<p>And (emphasis mine):<p>&quot;While we did not propose more detailed considerations for this factor within the regulatory text, we retained all prior interpretations of labor with respect to paper copies—that is, that the labor cost of copying <i>may not include the costs associated with searching for and retrieving the requested information</i>. With respect to electronic copies, we asserted that a reasonable cost-based fee includes costs attributable to the labor involved to review the access request and to produce the electronic copy, which we expected would be negligible.&quot;<p>And in response to comments (re: Electronic):<p>&quot;We clarify that labor costs included in a reasonable cost-based fee could include skilled technical staff time spent to create and copy the electronic file, such as compiling, extracting, scanning and burning protected health information to media, and distributing the media.&quot;<p>Also:<p>&quot;...in this final rule we clarify that a covered entity may not charge a retrieval fee (whether it be a standard retrieval fee or one based on actual retrieval costs). This interpretation will ensure that the fee requirements for electronic access are consistent with the requirements for hard copies, which do not allow retrieval fees for locating the data.&quot;<p>Finally, delineating costs when state law has something to say:<p>&quot;When a State law provides a limit on the fee that a covered entity may charge for a copy of protected health information, this is relevant in determining whether a covered entity’s fee is ‘‘reasonable’’ under
§ 164.524(c)(4). A covered entity’s fee must be both reasonable and cost-based. For example, if a State permits a charge of 25 cents per page, but a covered entity is able to provide an electronic copy at a cost of five cents per page, then the covered entity may not charge more than five cents per page (since that is the reasonable and cost-based amount). Similarly, if a covered entity’s cost is 30 cents per page but the State law limits the covered entity’s charge to 25 cents per page, then the covered entity may not charge more than 25 cents per page (since charging 30 cents per page would be the cost-based amount, but would not be reasonable in light of the State law).&quot;<p>All that together implies to me that HITECH would overrule all allowances for search/retrieval/other fees specified by state laws to zero.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/01/25/2013-01073/modifications-to-the-hipaa-privacy-security-enforcement-and-breach-notification-rules-under-the"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/01/25/2013-010...</a>",1421222210

8884857,comment,8884370,8884511,0,0,geofft,,,"It&#x27;s fairly rare that you want to write and modify a page somewhat simultaneously, as a high-level goal. Most of the time you&#x27;re loading some existing executable from disk, and once it&#x27;s loaded you&#x27;re executing it, so you can just have the kernel write to it, switch it to executable and nonwritable, and pass it back to the userspace process. Sometimes you have a JIT or a VM doing binary translation, but even there you typically JIT some code once and then call it one or more times, and if you JIT some other code it&#x27;s a different page. You don&#x27;t typically intersperse writing code to a page and executing that page. So you just want userspace to be a little rigorous about separating those two steps, and tell the kernel when it&#x27;s switching between those two, instead of requesting a page that&#x27;s simultaneously writable and executable.<p>As another commenter said, one of the reasons this isn&#x27;t done at the outset is that some architectures (notably x86-32) don&#x27;t implement W^X in hardware, so there&#x27;s no pressure to be 100% clean about this. But it&#x27;s rare that you have code that isn&#x27;t straightforward, at least conceptually, to rework into W^X compatibility.<p>One of the more annoying things is fixing up relocations: if you have a call to a function in a dynamic library, and you don&#x27;t know where that library is going to be loaded until it&#x27;s loaded, the most obvious way to implement this is to map your program code writable and fill in addresses once you know what they are. Each place where an address needs to be filled in is called a &quot;relocation&quot;. So when you load a dynamic library, you loop over all relocations and fill in any addresses for symbols contained in that dynamic library.<p>There are lots of reasons this is awful; one is that you have to go update every place in the program code. So you indirect that through a thing called the &quot;procedure linkage table&quot; (PLT), which contains a bunch of tiny functions that just go call your real dynamic functions, and you hard-code references to the PLT. The PLT still has to be writable, though. If you don&#x27;t want that, you make a separate section of the program called the &quot;global offset table&quot; (GOT) that contains addresses, and you have each stub function in the PLT do an indirect function calls to a matching entry in the GOT. So the PLT is executable and doesn&#x27;t need to be writable, and the GOT is writable and doesn&#x27;t need to be executable.<p>If you want to be super paranoid, you resolve all your dynamic libraries at startup and mark the GOT as read-only (&quot;bind now&quot; and read-only relocations aka &quot;relro&quot;, respectively), so that nothing is writable. But that&#x27;s a different discussion from W^X.<p>(This telling is not very historically accurate about how the PLT and GOT came to exist, but hopefully the explanation of what they do is close enough to correct to convey the general ideas.)",1421221251

8884834,story,,,1,0,Lambent_Cactus,"Treats is just an arbitrage on a loophole in laws against illegal lotteries",,"TechCrunch&#x27;s article describing the latest iteration of Clinkle describes users earning lottery tickets every seven purchases:<p>&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;
Vague descriptions of Clinkle have proliferated, but Duplan gave me the specifics on how his new app Treats will actually function:<p>You sign up for Treats, order its debit card, and add money to it.
You swipe your Treats card to make purchases like normal, with no extra fee, though there are charges for ATM use, etc.
After every seventh purchase you earn a Treat.
You take a photo to create a virtual gift card, and send the Treat to a friend. You can’t redeem it yourself.
Your friend is notified they have a Treat waiting to be unlocked.
Other friends can see the locked Treat and its photo, and can “Boost” aka Like the Treat to increase the chance it will be a winner.
The friend who received the Treat swipes their Treats card to make a purchase, unlocking the Treat.
If the Treat is a winner, they immediately get refunded the entire price of the purchase they just made.
Whether or not they win, they then see the photo gift card you sent them.
&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;<p>http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/13/social-slot-machine/<p>US law defines a contest as an illegal lottery if it has three elements: (1) chance, (2) a prize, and (3) &#x27;consideration&#x27;, which means value form the recipient. (see e.g. http://goo.gl/UdE8r4 (pdf))<p>Here, it looks like Clinkle is trying to say this isn&#x27;t illegal gambling because the person receiving the treat doesn&#x27;t have to do anything of value to get it - it&#x27;s the treat earner who made the seven purchases and other friends who like the Treat to &#x27;boost&#x27; it. The hope, obviously, is that recipients will be obliged to pay it back (or forwards) by _social_ obligations, but those are conveniently off the books as far as the law is concerned. The whole thing is an elaborate way to run a numbers racket without technically running an illegal lottery.<p>So, good luck with that.",1421220736

If you use that instead of the B-tree, I would expect it to be at least as fast as Nim.<p>B-trees are especially bad for string keys, because comparisons are expensive.<p>EDIT: From Rust docs: &quot;Currently, our implementation simply performs naive linear search. This provides excellent performance on small nodes of <i>elements which are cheap to compare</i>&quot;. (emphasis mine)",1421218958

A lot of scientific libraries have been ultra optimized for Fortran.<p>I&#x27;m sure optimized libraries could be written in any language, however the vast number of researchers have decided that Fortran is by far more accurate and faster (for these libraries) so they go with that.",1421218895

They are kind of evil in applications already (because they amplify the &quot;synchronous require&quot; problem). Test your library against a version of 6to5, compile, publish, and remove that paragraph in font size 48 from your README.*<p>(*) I hope you add such a paragraph when your library relies on a global require hook that changes the default behavior of require for all .js files in all libraries.",1421218836

I believe that my development and education as a programmer was severely hampered by BASIC’s lack of functions, and I would not wish it on anyone else.<p>Python has many obvious separate levels of learning it.  At first, one could learn line-by-line coding, as done in the interactive interpreter, gradually moving into loops.   Then, one could spend a long time with functions, dipping deeper and deeper into data types, sequences, recursion, etc.  Only <i>after</i> this could one even <i>mention</i> classes and object oriented programming.  There is <i>no</i> reason to assume that one would need to learn all of Python all at once.<p>A good language is also a language which allows its users to <i>grow</i>, not a toy language which teaches its users the futility of ever trying to accomplish anything serious, which is precisely the feeling I got from BASIC.",1452131906

Take the inquisition - by burning hereticks you saved their souls, and this was therefore good - so do as you would be done by applies, even if it comprises an auto da fé.<p>I think the point is this--if the skull collector became the source of a skull, or the burner became a heretic, they would probably stop thinking those were &quot;good&quot; practices (due to the suffering and death and such), so those acts wouldn&#x27;t satisfy the &quot;do as you would be done by&quot; rule.

(And the next thought in the article, which is: These “strengths” are real, but the stupid public is slow to realize them!) Ha! Before Uber, I took a lengthy (probably $40) cab ride (with a stop in the middle to pick up a friend) in San Francisco. Now, I stupidly left my iPhone in the back seat, somehow. <i>However,</i> I <i>immediately</i> realized this upon exiting, and <i>immediately</i> used my friend’s phone to call Yellow Cab <i>with the cab number of the taxi I just exited</i> to request they send the driver back. They said they would “try.” They failed, despite my follow-up calls and pleas. (And the driver could not have gotten far, as this was in a less dense area of SF.)<p>A day or two later, I made the trek to the Yellow Cab offices in SF (which took time, Muni + a good walk). I then spent a long time waiting to be seen, only to be told that Yellow was “just a co-operative” that wasn’t liable; and, infuriatingly, they <i>refused to give me the identity of the driver in question.</i> I had wanted to file a police report naming the driver.<p>I never got my phone back — or an ounce of justice.<p>This is not a rare or freak incident, as anyone who has ridden taxis enough times can attest. I lost another pricey personal item three years earlier in an Austin cab, and was similarly left without recourse when the driver failed to acknowledge requests for its return.<p>It’s obvious the accountability that drivers have in any ride-sharing platform far outweigh the supposed criminal checks done by slimeball companies like Yellow Cab. If that same driver tried shit like that on Uber, not only would his rating drop, but he himself would be dropped because Uber itself would actually give a s--t when a customer reported this sort of incident!

But let&#x27;s suppose that if I did then I would be convinced that the economic effects of copyright extension are better understood as that type of protectionism.<p>That doesn&#x27;t change the fact that I still have evidence that Disney is explicitly involved both directly and indirectly in lobbying for copyright extension.  And they start lobbying for it like clockwork as soon as <i>Steamboat Willie</i> starts threatening to slide into public domain.<p>Therefore no matter what the economic arguments, I believe that the people actually changing the rules are changing it to keep Mickey Mouse under copyright.<p>That said, I think little of the position taken in that analysis.  It claims that the public is forced to buy potentially-inferior modern IP.  To the contrary, I believe that the public is free to not buy IP at all, but instead to find other ways to entertain themselves.  In fact I believe that if modern authors and artists could freely draw on iconic past IP, they could create compelling new works drawing on the old ones which would increase consumption of IP.  Thereby making the public happier AND content creators richer.<p>Therefore I believe that the net effect of copyright extension is to increase the rent that current content owners can get from past content at the cost of both the public and current content creators.  (And yes, this holds true even though there are content creators employed by content owners.)<p>---<p>As to &quot;nobody benefits much&quot;, I remember one of the briefs that I saw for Eldred v. Ashcroft that demonstrated that over 99% of the possible present value of a work is captured by the author under the terms of the 1976 law.  That is, if we take the possibility of public domain away and assign perpetual copyright to authors, we will not add more than about 1% to the compensation authors can expect.<p>Turning that figure around, today&#x27;s content creators would be better off with the 1976 laws if they in aggregate could increase consumed commercial content by more than 1% from having full access to past content to work from.  (Exactly like Walt Disney did with works like Sleeping Beauty.)  I believe that this is quite possible.  A number of economic experiments have found that increasing availability of free content increases consumption and ultimately increases revenue to artists.  See, for example, <a href=""http://www.baen.com/library/prime_palaver1.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.baen.com/library/prime_palaver1.asp</a> for one of them.",1452128927

10855203,comment,10852261,10853509,0,0,Brakenshire,,,"> they have a decent selection of British TV (ironically they have more BBC shows than BBC&#x27;s own streaming service).<p>> Their selection of popular/well known movies has been decreasing over time though, as they&#x27;ve been losing some of those licences. But there&#x27;s enough of them that it&#x27;s good enough for &quot;I want to watch some movie, let&#x27;s see what&#x27;s on Netflix&quot;.<p>Not sure I agree with either. They have some old UK TV, but not that much. BBC offers almost no archive tv on iPlayer, so that&#x27;s not much of a comparison! And I had to spend a significant amount of time trying to find any film I wanted to watch. My impression of the services was a bit like renting access to 10-15 box sets (Mad Men, Breaking Bad, some BBC Dickens adaptations, etc), and about 50 randomly selected, vaguely entertaining films. I had it for about 4 months before running out of anything I wanted to watch.",1452128590

The only difference is on Uber I can give that guy feedback, whereas with cab drivers that&#x27;s a tedious bureaucratic process that nobody pursues.",1452128590

My question has been called hypothetical (and rightfully so), thus let me make it clear that I'm not actually talking about these very people, but just about the described events in terms of an abstract storyline.<p>I think that what we make of a story like that is very much influenced by how we perceive the characters. Many of us will, for instance, be outraged by the actions of this girl - how could she! Now, since we're putting reality aside, what if a week later, there was another newspaper article, this time reporting the conviction of the guy from the first article.<p>This would then perhaps change our perception of the roles. That was what I was after with my question, and whether that would change the way we assess the girl's actions. I was hoping for a (perhaps more philosophical) discussion, but that clearly didn't work you.<p>It is now clear to me that I should have made a stricter separation between the abstract events and the concrete people involved. I never meant to accuse the guy (or the girl for that matter) of anything, I apologize for any misunderstandings that might have given such an impression.<p>Other than that, I've been basically asked ""why bother about hypotheticals"", so it seems that not a lot of people find such a thought experiment as interesting as I do.",1367992692

I've found myself for the past couple of years increasingly fighting websites and their design in the interests of simply being able to <i>read</i> content.  I've flagged numerous submissions to HN on that basis alone.  And joined the Contrast Rebellion (<a href=""http://contrastrebellion.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://contrastrebellion.com/</a>).<p>After using element editors to interactively correct issues, userContent.css to override settings (especially font face, and size), and other hacks, I stumbled across Readability.  First the bookmarklets and browser plug-ins that simply reformatted pages to be more readable, then finally finding that the full-blown service, including saved reading lists and tags, was worthwhile to me.<p>Which addresses <i>another</i> failing of browsers:  the insanely poor UI/UX of bookmarks management. It's not just the sharing aspect, but being able to enter, arrange, tag, annotate, deduplicate, etc., bookmarks.<p>I've been seeing a place increasingly for two modes of browser:  an app-mode browser for highly interactive sites, and a <i>content</i> browser, whose aim is to provide access to, and management of, <i>informational</i> content.<p>One mode I've found Readability hugely useful for is in bookmarking, categorizing, prioritizing, and reading a large volume of literature related to research I'm doing.  And presenting that information in a way that's tolerable to read.  The only downside so far:  a per-user limit of 500 tags.<p>I'd also <i>love</i> to have something resembling Readability (preferably  itself) for PDFs, which are absolutely awful to read online, and impossible on mobile (yes, I've got Adobe's PDF reader for Android, it's freaking useless).<p>ePub and readers such as Calibre and Moon+Reader are another approach to online documents I very much appreciate.<p>Some associated G+ posts / rants:<p>Readability:  two days in -- VERY nice\n<a href=""https://plus.google.com/104092656004159577193/posts/PhQR421etdT"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/104092656004159577193/posts/PhQR421e...</a><p>Dear Internet Desiners: We need to talk\n<a href=""https://plus.google.com/104092656004159577193/posts/NFEFMZdkd5q"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/104092656004159577193/posts/NFEFMZdk...</a><p>Annoying Web annoyancs are annoying: CSS Interstitials\n<a href=""https://plus.google.com/104092656004159577193/posts/j357ACUsejY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/104092656004159577193/posts/j357ACUs...</a>",1367990895

5672642,comment,5670079,5671543,1,0,laughfactory,,,"@ruswick I agree. You said what I was attempting to say with a great deal more clarity.<p>Nearly $40 is a lot for an unknown quantity for someone like me who is convinced that Meteor is a big deal, but who is also learning web development from the ground-up. And yes, I should probably start with something a little easier for a beginner to rap their head around.<p>But there really are people like me out there who are interested in learning Meteor for whom $39 (or $30) represents a lot of money. I'm a grad student, working part-time for $14/hour, with a homemaker wife and baby. My allowance, when I can get it, is $50 a month. Yep, that's how some of us roll.<p>So maybe sharing that sheds some light on how and why someone (like me) might be price sensitive--even when it seems ridiculous to others who make a LOT more money.<p>That said, after getting the expense approved by my wife, I did actually take advantage of the $30 launch list price and am currently working my way through the book. The first 28 pages have been worthwhile. I like that, similar to the Hartl Rails Tutorial, it attempts to cover the whole development life cyle including deploying locally, to Meteor, to Heroku, and to EC2, etc. For beginners like me who really crave learning about the whole process, this is a boon.",1367990338

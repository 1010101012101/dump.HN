The first issue is addressed in this blog post. The questions just aren't good enough. This is nobody's fault really, because it is very difficult to come up with a set of hard questions that measure your intellect and don't require lots of domain specific knowledge. It's either within a certain domain. If everyone taking the test was a Mathematician for example, the questions could be more clearly defined.<p>The second issue is that intelligence is multi-dimensional yet people try to measure it on a one dimensional scale. What's worse, the dimensions of intellect are somewhat elusive as well, so you can't just say something like IQ is the sum of values on each axis. Personally, I think that people that are high achievers in any field (business, arts, athletics, leadership, politics, science) are intelligent in some way. But when you look at all those people, there's no common denominator, no discernable pattern for intelligence.",1352055431

In DF, connections are routed to per-CPU network service threads based on a consistent hash; as a connection will always route to the same CPU, locking requirements are simpler. There are some places where the 'lower-half' network code does unfortunately take locks (when delivering data to socket buffers), but on the whole it's a good design. Solaris chose the same model, called it FireEngine; they have more writeups, if you're interested.<p>The changes in the 3.2 release that improved PostGres/pgbench performance were just good-old-fashioned lock breaking (spreading UNIX domain socket locking out), bypassing inefficient paths when possible (ex: bypass instantiating a buffercache buffer when data can be read directly from the page cache), and the new scheduler work. One other change was a neat trick, a form of page-table sharing; many of those changes would make sense on FreeBSD or similar systems.<p>The page-table sharing work addressed a problem seen years ago in Linux -- the cost of pv_entry manipulations. Linux moved from rmap to objrmap (<a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/75198/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lwn.net/Articles/75198/</a>); FreeBSD reduced the cost of pv_entries by reducing their size and packing them densely. DFly's page-table sharing reduced the number of pv_entries (basically de-duped them) in particular situations (correct alignment/size of matched mapping; SHM segments, like in X or PostGres benefit most).",1352053665

At the end of the day, it merely measures your ability to perform well on tests that are similar to an IQ test. Traditionally, this set was populated with academic tests, so the IQ could be used to predict your performance in schools (it was actually designed to predict the performance of French schoolchildren.)<p>However, as the school based subjects have broadened out from traditional liberal arts conceptualizations to include more serious discussion of alternative conceptualizations (CompSci being one example), the IQ test may be decreasing in efficacy of prediction even with regards to academic tests. I have no evidence for this, just an opinion. The issue you ran into seems to be a result of these differing conceptualization paradigms.<p>At the end of the day, it's an assessment of performance in a very limited subfield of life.

If you are unable to manifest your intelligence in a way that can substantially (disproportionate to your effort) improve your life or the lives of others, then your mind doesn't matter. It has no impact in the world, and I am not the first person to observe that having a powerful mind is at many times a burden.<p>You can see that other people may be more stupid than you, forwarding simpler arguments and relying on less rigorous thinking than yours, but if they don't want to be convinced of that, then you are powerless to make them see it. They go off blissfully, and you burn with anguish. Again, if you cannot manifest your intelligence in a way that forwards your agenda, who cares?<p>To phrase it in a more confrontational way: if nobody is forced to contend with your mind, nobody knows it exists.  Or to summarize it in a quote:<p><i>""[Intelligence] is like being a lady: if you have to tell people you are, you aren't.""</i>\n-- Margaret Thatcher<p>This clicked for me during my final year of college, when a friend of mine was taking an LSAT preparation course.

The instructor, a man of maybe 30, who had been out of school for several years, scoffed and replied, ""Good luck, I only got 165 and I'm a genius.""<p>And what did the genius do when not teaching LSAT prep courses?

In the clear.<p>By ""complications for privacy"", you must mean the complete lack of privacy. There is no privacy. Zero. None. Zilch.<p>The only balloting system in the USA that preserves the secret ballot is a dropping your ballot into the ballot box at a poll site. Because the box scrambles the order. Postal balloting can partially preserve the secret ballot (on the receiving end) if proper rules are followed (but generally aren't). Exactly no electronic system preserves the secret ballot.<p>You misrepresent the photo identification requirement. Meaning it's a complete non-issue trumped to scare people. In the USA, everyone must first be registered (except in North Dakota?), which establishes your eligibility to vote. On election day, until recently, voters merely have to prove who they are with any form of identification showing their current address. This is mostly to ensure voters are issued the correct ballot (for their precinct).<p>Knowing what I know about the history of election administration and its current direction, I'm curious to learn what you'd consider ""moves us forward""? I'll even give you an out: Anyone advocating any form of electronically mediated voting must admit that it eliminates all voter privacy (secret ballot) and most of the public vote count (ability to audit). So the challenge is to create the digital successor to the Australian Ballot system used in the USA.

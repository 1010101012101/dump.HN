6331074,comment,6329149,6330934,0,0,phaus,,,"My point was that in India, the authorities don&#x27;t preserve justice even when serious crimes have been committed, so its doubtful that they would care about things as insignificant as false-advertising.<p>If a society&#x27;s legal system is demonstrably corrupt, the rest of the society is bound to follow.<p>You could argue that the same thing applies to the United States, and I would agree. Right now, however, I feel that the stage the U.S. justice system is in is that of the functional alcoholic. Its still working for the most part, but it could completely fall apart at any time.<p>>Is that your final conclusion?<p>Yes. It is a shitty place to live, unless you come from a privileged family. It obviously doesn&#x27;t have to be, and it might not always be but as of today, it is. If you took a hundred random people and asked them which country they would rather live in(Out of the two), probably at least 75 (And this is generous) would say the United States, even though we are in the middle of a downward spiral. If you asked them which country they would rather live in as a lower-middle class citizen, only an imbecile (or perhaps someone with family in India) would choose to live in India.<p>The United States botches rape trials on a regular basis, but still, in spite of our own corrupt system, it&#x27;s significantly better than what&#x27;s going on in India. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to find out that you are correct, and that the per-capita rape statistics are similar. However, in the United States, you have a much better chance of bringing the perpetrator to justice.",1378335502

In Android, lot of half baked apps pollute the store (and the fake ratings and review destroy any sort of app discovery) that it is simply not worth it.<p>While we have had our share of frusturation with the apple app store process (weird rejections that had to be explained etc), I don&#x27;t see Android as an alternative to iOS appstore for startups.

I always had to tell them &quot;It would require such a massive redesign that it&#x27;s not feasible.&quot;<p>Yes totally, I agree that arena allocation is great.  I think we both agree on this point, though we&#x27;ve taken two different paths in attempting to solve it.<p>Your approach is to say that arena allocation can be made pretty convenient, and sparse messages can compress really well, so let&#x27;s design a message format that is amenable to arena allocation and then implement a system that uses this format both on-the-wire and in memory.<p>My approach is to say that we can solve this (and many other related problems) by decoupling wire formats from in-memory formats, and having the two interoperate through parsers that implement a common visitor-like interface.  Then a single parser (which has been optimized to hell) can populate any kind of in-memory format, or stream its output to some other wire format.  Of course this will never beat a no-parser design in speed, but the world will never have all its data in one single format.<p>I think of these two approaches as totally complimentary; to me Capn Proto is simply another key/value serialization format with a particular set of nice properties, and I want it to be easy to convert between that and other formats.<p>Since your approach is much more focused, you have been able to turn out usable results orders of magnitude faster than I have.  I&#x27;m spending time implementing all of the various protobuf features and edge cases that have accumulated over the years, while simultaneously refining my visitor interface to be able to accommodate them while remaining performance-competitive with the existing protobuf implementation (and not getting too complex).

The Facebook case is definitely different in that they were building new features too fast to keep up with.<p>My project (single developer) is undergoing a big underlying change (switching from MongoDB to Postgresql) at the moment. I still need to keep development going on the live branch while I do this work. I&#x27;m doing it because I&#x27;m having maintainability issues with the data store that I&#x27;ve been putting off for a couple of months. It&#x27;s as you say - make sure you refactor before you discover that refactoring is impossible.

Since that time, social networks and email providers such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn and Yahoo! have embraced open identity standards. And now, billions of people who have created accounts with these services can use their identities to easily register and login to sites across the web in the way myOpenID was intended.<p>By 2009 it had become obvious that the vast majority of consumers would prefer to utilize an existing identity from a recognized provider rather than create their own myOpenID account. As a result, our business focus changed to address this desire, and we introduced social login technology. While the technology is slightly different from where we were in 2006, Im confident that we are still delivering on our initial promise  that people should take control of their online identity and are empowered to carry those identities with them as they navigate the web.<p>For those of you who still actively use myOpenID, I can understand your disappointment to hear this news and apologize if this causes you any inconvenience. To reduce this inconvenience, we are delaying the end of life of the service until February 1, 2014 to give you time to begin using other identities on those sites where you use myOpenID today.<p>Speaking on behalf of Janrain, I truly appreciate your past support of myOpenID.<p>Sincerely,\nLarry",1378332050

I want to know if I have ApoE4 or some other gene that highly correlates with currently-incurable diseases. If I have a better idea of my life expectancy and my future quality of life, I can change my behavior today. I would live my life quite differently if I thought I my brain would rot in 20 years.",1281927579

It's a story of inventors and industrialists coming away with extremely modest financial gains, despite huge accomplishment, over and over.  Greater fortunes were made in completely low tech and un-revolutionized businesses like pottery.<p>The idea that the industrial revolution was a matter of legal frameworks and financial motivations is not particular plausible in light of the financial facts.  The people who drove the industrial revolution never much profited.<p>""A Farewell to Alms"" argues the industrial revolution happened in Britain because to a degree unique to Britain, the most productive and responsible people had the most children for several generations.  It is documented in great detail how this was the true.  Through eugenic forces, the British worker and the British engineer had become driven enough to create the industrial revolution.",1281927287

'Business founders' think they have all the right stuff and see 16 year olds building facemash or yousquare, then assume anyone can program with a book and an afternoon.<p>Truth is, if you can slot yourself into one of these classifications that easily you're probably not going to be a very good startup cofounder. A startup requires people to wear lots of different hats, with some being in the technical side and others being on the business side. While normal people, aka business and technical founders, can wear one, maybe two hats at a time, start up founders need to be 12 headed hydras.<p>I'm not saying that there's no specialization on a startup team; it's necessary.

But, you quickly start running into issues with polluting the namespace (which is why Guido says not to do it). For example, one HTML tag is p, so now we have to use a different accumulator. I find p very natural because I think ""print"" every time, I used 't' for a while (months) but it just never clicked. Furthermore, HTML has other tags like a, so now you can't use either p or a as one-off variables anywhere without weird bugs or confusing reads of the code, not to mention other common names.<p>Moreover, I even tried using import html as h to save typing. It actually made the templates <i>less</i> readable (I think because of less long explicitness).  It can take a few minutes, but actually you quickly get used to the repeated p(html( and it just becomes a useful guidepost when reading through a template quickly.<p>Your second suggestion of a language is nice and clean, but you lose a lot in terms of flexibility and power.

I have added enough functionality and simplicity so that I can do everything I need to do, plus it is obvious how to do it.

This confusion does not help us to think clearly about the question.<p>Definition 1:  Consciousness is awareness of your external environment.  By that definition, my dog is conscious, insects are, and cars are becoming so.  And if cars are conscious, then this must be a mechanistic property - it just takes enough sensors (and perhaps complex enough wiring).<p>Definition 2:  Consciousness is awareness of your own awareness - being able to watch yourself think, and to think about thinking.  By that definition, humans are conscious, but I&#x27;m not sure about dogs, or even apes.  It is much less clear that this is purely mechanistic.<p>But when we have these discussions, it&#x27;s going to be helpful to specify which version we&#x27;re talking about.",1421870358

I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great model if you&#x27;re trying to sell ads, but in terms of UX I think it&#x27;s the pits.<p>Combine with the lack of anonymity and prominent karma scores, and you&#x27;ve got a recipe for constant regurgitation of lowest-common-denominator memes, shitposting, and cults of personalty.<p>That&#x27;s why reddit is quickly becoming one of my least favourite websites.",1421870260

Our API helps developers get their educational applications in front of millions of students, and it helps schools manage all their apps while keeping their students’ data secure.  If you’re a developer and you’ve built a great educational application, now you can get it in front of students without having to build a complex integration with every ancient school software package.  If you’re a teacher, we’re an app store - and a way to use great educational apps without spending 15 minutes at the beginning of class helping students get set up and logged in.  To students, we’re a dashboard; with our single sign-on Instant Login service, kids have one identity that manages all of the apps they use.<p>We’ve also experienced incredible growth: after only two years of existence, we’re moving data for 13 million students, and we’re in over 20% of schools in America (over 30,000 schools).  We’ve just raised a $30M Series B, and we’re ready to expand even more rapidly.<p>Where you fit in:
We’re looking for full stack engineers: developers who are willing to work across the stack and have some kind of specialty, whether that’s product design, DevOps, databases, or system programming.  Right now we’re a team of 46 people (20 engineers), and we work mostly in Node (Coffeescript), Go and Python.<p>Other stuff we like:<p>-Tech talks. Every other Tuesday, we do “Clever Talks” during lunch where one of us will give a presentation on anything he/she’s interested in. Recent talks have covered exoplanets, neuroscience, the history of hip-hop, hacking big-company customer service interactions, and what’s wrong with American high school history education.<p>-Bughouse chess.

Some of the software code was written by genetics but the majority of them are written after birth by the environment. Now there are two major differences between computer system and a human:<p>a: computer systems are Turing machines, humans are not. Human uses intuition to perform induction which Turing machine can not (because induction is not logic). And induction is such an important foundation of human understanding of the world that I believe a Turing machine&#x27;s understanding of the world based on pure logic would be very different.<p>b: human minds is aware of himself, he can think about his own mind, and think about the thinking about his own mind. It is like if the software can model the software itself, without entering an endless recursive loop. That is fundamental property of consciousness.<p>My guess is that the fact that human mind relies on intuition rather than logic (non Turing machine) is the reason he can recursively think about himself while computer can&#x27;t, after all he intuitively knows when to stop and jump out of the recursive loop.",1421870045

8925217,comment,8923687,8924977,0,0,vertex-four,,,"> Care to expand?<p>Certainly. It&#x27;s not access to free OSes that&#x27;s the problem - it&#x27;s that both the major one and most of the minor ones are derivatives of either UNIX or the POSIX specification. (Haiku is the only semi-popular one which attempts to do something different.) There&#x27;s little chance of stepping outside that box in any major way.<p>For example, a slowly-moving research project of mine is to build a fully functional OS that uses capabilities, per-application sandboxing, a generic object store instead of a filesystem, a built-in intra- and inter-computer RPC mechanism, standardised configuration (from the network admin level downwards), and a powerful Smalltalk-based GUI for managing all of this, on the idea that today&#x27;s information workers need better ability to manage and script their system, including building new applications out of existing ones. The Linux ecosystem doesn&#x27;t provide a meaningful, standardised interface for doing so for many office-y applications or complex formats.<p>While you could theoretically layer all this on top of POSIX (and in fact, that&#x27;s the first implementation of my system), you are at the same time throwing away 99% of POSIX, and you are highly expected to maintain compatibility with apps for the system you&#x27;re building on top of - which likely don&#x27;t fit in with your system&#x27;s design, and doesn&#x27;t encourage the creation of applications for, or modification of existing applications to fit, your new system design.<p>This sort of greenfield R&D is what&#x27;s been missing. Even universities are primarily stuck getting POSIX running on various kernel architectures, avoiding the topic of <i>OS</i> design entirely. You could point towards Android as a counter-example, but that&#x27;s not a desktop OS - its primary competitors were proprietary OSes made by the smartphone vendors, and it&#x27;s still not really capable of being used as a primary OS.",1421869867

I&#x27;m trying to not hire them in senior positions.<p>For example, I had a recent project where we were analyzing user data and producing a bunch of edges representing potential connections detected between users, as a way of sniffing out fraud rings.<p>One feature associated with this was a banning UI, allowing loss prevention types to navigate through the graph, select groups of users according to certain criteria, and generally look for patterns that are evidence of fraud rings manually, to supplement the automatically generated analysis.<p>There are a lot of front end people who will go into brainlock on this kind of thing.

Humans have &quot;more&quot; and a dog has &quot;less&quot; and a fly has &quot;hardly any&quot;. We are not too far out into the water, here, really. There is some sort of meaningful something that humans have lots of, dogs have less of, and flies have hardly any, even from a strictly physical perspective.<p>Now, suppose we assume that the end of the article is correct and &quot;consciousness&quot; is really just a form of integrated information processing, and their device for measuring the interconnected nature of a given brain is measuring something meaningful.<p>(And let me take a moment to observe that when I say &quot;assume&quot;, I&#x27;m serious. I&#x27;m not asking for <i>agreement</i>, I&#x27;m saying, work with me and assume for the sake of a discussion.)<p>Now, we are <i>still</i> not too far out into the waters here. We have a device that is measuring something real, and fairly non-mysterious. It would not be hard to create an equivalent for a computer system by considering the system as a set of graph nodes, then probing the connectivity of the system. We&#x27;re still standing on fairly concrete ground.<p>Now, consider that in the near future we will be able to build computer systems that by any basic connectivity metric (average number of neighbors, various stats of connectivity shape, etc.) would match even human brains, but can be demonstrably doing something very simple like just copying data from here to there, something that is clearly not &quot;conscious&quot; behavior.<p>Characterize the difference between my hypothetical computer system that matches the human brain on $RELEVANT_CONNECTIVITY_METRIC and the actual human brain. In theory, as you refine the connectivity metric you should also be describing to me how to build a human-equivalent brain, too, or at least telling me exactly how I&#x27;m falling short.<p>Note this is a sort of mathematical argument, where I&#x27;m asking you to bring your own $CONNECTIVITY_METRIC to the party. It seems pretty clear that it can&#x27;t be as simple as whether or not it is or is not of a certain size and happens to follow a power law in the connectivity graph, because it&#x27;s <i>really</i> easy to produce a program that would have that level of connectivity and still not be conscious. (A naively-written non-trivial program naturally has a power-law distribution to it.)<p>This phrases the problem in a fairly practical way (&quot;how do I build a human-class AI?&quot;), demonstrates the difficulty of answering it <i>even given</i> a powerful and potentially incorrect assumption, and is phrased virtually entirely in physical terms such that a sufficiently concrete and accurate answer would very likely lead to the ability to build AI. And we have no clue about that $CONNECTIVITY_METRIC. All we&#x27;ve got is some people asserting that the answer lies in this direction and others asserting it doesn&#x27;t and very little hard data to help us answer that question.<p>And I&#x27;d also observe that I&#x27;m not even worried about <i>the</i> answer, this generalizes trivially to the &quot;set&quot; of conscious behaviors, and also your choice of whatever test you like to apply for consciousness up to and including &quot;I&#x27;ll know it when I see it&quot;, since right now we can&#x27;t answer any of these variants.",1421869341

8925082,comment,8923008,8923008,0,0,lmkg,,,"I strongly encourage people to read the book <i>The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind</i> by Julian Jaynes. He makes some rather solid and defensible statements about consciousness (included falsifiable predictions that were later validated with brain imaging), and then makes some rather fantastical inferences. It&#x27;s thought-provoking.<p>One of the very first things he does in that book is provide a definition of consciousness that he uses throughout the book. It&#x27;s a more concrete definition than I&#x27;ve seen in most other places, and in part because it&#x27;s <i>very small</i>. Like most others, I tend to roll my eyes a bit when philosophers start talking about how consciousness is the act of feeling and experiencing, and is the core of being, and is the sum totality of human experience, and start getting all mystic about it. Jaynes takes the opposite approach: it&#x27;s not all and everything of human experience, it&#x27;s exactly one specific thing about human experience.<p>Specifically, introspection. The ability to not just observe the real world, but to create a simulated world in our minds and observe that. Replay memories, or test hypothetical present or future situations. Anything else unique about the human mind is taken to be a consequence of consciousness, rather than a part of it.<p>Another big thing he does is show that activities that we normally think of as conscious and rational/intelligent are actually not taking place in the consciousness (these are backed by experimental evidence). For example, chess players get a lot of their performance from perception that filters information before it hits the consciousness. For another, decision-making is shown to be a pre-conscious activity, and a person&#x27;s supposed line of reasoning is actually a post-hoc rationalization of the decision that the sub-conscious mind dumped into the consciousness (I forget the details of how this is demonstrated). The latter result is... disturbing, because it challenges your notion of free will. But the more I observe myself and others, I can&#x27;t help but think it&#x27;s true.<p>One major upshot of this: I think there&#x27;s sort of an implicit assumption that consciousness is some sort of &quot;higher form&quot; of intelligence. Jayne&#x27;s work casts doubt on that. It seems that consciousness interacts with intelligence, but most of our &quot;intelligence&quot; does not come from (what he considers) the faculty of consciousness.<p>Observationally, this seems to agree with the state of AI research, and the distinction between weak AI and strong AI. In fact, if one accepts his theories, then weak AI is actually just unqualified Artificial Intelligence, and what we currently call strong AI is not AI at all, but Artificial Consciousness, which should rightly be a separate field.",1421868806

(Ctrl+A and Ctrl+P collide on Win, Linux and keyboard management in ubuntu is messy and unreliable)<p>* Modifier-remapping is easy and solid on OSX (Need to run the download.com gauntlet on Windows, Linux is again an unreliable mess)<p>* Opening a document&#x27;s parent folder(s) is easy and universal on OSX (command click on document icon in title bar), good luck finding this outside an IDE anywhere else.<p>* Turning off a laptop&#x27;s screen on demand is easy and reliable on OSX. It&#x27;s frustrating on windows (I need 2 apps and a couple lines of code, wtf) and a nightmare on linux (where you&#x27;re lucky to get working brightness control at all, let alone one that goes all the way to 0).<p>* Thermal management is solid on OSX. I can let my laptop build at night and sleep in the same room because the fan controller actually works. Meanwhile, Linux doesn&#x27;t recognize the fans (you know what that means: max rpm all the time) and windows revs up like a NASCAR driver in rush hour traffic (it bluescreened both custom fan control apps I&#x27;ve tried, naturally).<p>* It&#x27;s easy to get a file from Finder into &quot;Open...&quot; dialogs: just drag and drop (e.g. attach file), as opposed to re-navigating through the entire filesystem. Windows has one especially braindead &quot;open&quot; dialog type that almost seems to be designed for the particular purpose of making this difficult (you know, the one that doesn&#x27;t let you Ctrl+L, doesn&#x27;t scroll sideways, doesn&#x27;t remember the last directory you were in, etc).<p>* Finder knows how to sort alphabetically. For some reason the closest that Windows is willing to do is &quot;Sort by File/Folder status, and THEN alphabetically by name.&quot; This has the very frustrating effect that unzipped folders are often very far (both in screen space and keyboard space) from their .zip files. When you have to deal with a lot of them, this gets frustrating FAST.<p>I&#x27;ll give Microsoft one thing: the Windows+X menu is a fine piece of work. But I imagine you have a list similar to my own of things that you like about Windows and can&#x27;t find anywhere else.

It broke down under certain circumstances which are not (largely) encountered under daily live, so our intuition was useless to deceive the faults in it&#x27;s laws, yet this did not stop people of the time from thinking it was the end-all-be-all set of rules that described physical reality. Newtonian physics is certainly <i>not</i> the branch of physical that would help you understanding free will and agency.<p>Then Einstein came around, and amended (some of) Newtons problems.

Of course (assuming we don&#x27;t blow ourselves up or the like, as this may take quite some time) we&#x27;ll not only understand what&#x27;s going on in the brain, but will be able to build conscious machines, machines which we will quickly find resemble us more closely than machines and at this point will see that the amazing phenomenon we call consciousness is the not the sole domain of humanity, but just the sole example(let&#x27;s exclude other animals from this thought for simplicity) of such up until that point. It might take awhile though, evolution took a billions of years to get consciousness to this point, I think it&#x27;s only fair to give humanity a bit more time before we call it a lost cause.",1421868639

This means a sign needs to be added or changed. Some reasons for rule adds or changes:<p><i></i>* new growth in the area causes increased demand for parking, requiring restrictions on non-resident parking. <i></i>* a new area gets appropriated as part of a city/county and new enforcement follows. <i></i>* residents are tired of their spaces getting yanked by people outside the neighborhood. <i></i>* street traffic changes due to development, causing increased demand along a new street, creating the need for more restriction. <i></i>* street cleaning is (finally) implemented, or schedules change. <i></i>* a new commercial entity requires loading zones. <i></i>* a new school pops up or is [re]moved<p>The #2 reason for the current sign design is visibility.<p>You have to be able to read a parking sign from your car, on the road, while moving, in inclement weather, and considering not everyone&#x27;s sight is &#x27;ideal&#x27;. Even if there was one sign, often there are multiple overlapping restrictions which can&#x27;t simply be put into a single time slot.

The various colors, bolded words, and arrows help give insight as to what each sign is intending to tell you, without necessarily needing to be a native speaker. Other countries tend to use more pictograms on their signs which certainly help in these cases.<p>I think the redesigned sign is very useful, but one single sign is just not going to replace the accessibility and functionality of several large simple signs.

There is obviously a great demand for this kind of immersion within the gaming community (although I would argue that Oculus will have market control for the forseeable future).<p>My opinion is that the kind of augmented reality that we all dream of, that sort of matrix-like constant data download, won&#x27;t become a reality until someone figures out how to take it (visibly) out of human interaction, i.e. with smart contacts, etc. The current tech is just too intrusive in normal human interaction.

If not great and important, at least the subject of who are &quot;you&quot; is a deeply and profoundly intimate question to ponder.<p>I distinctly remember first learning some basic laws of Newtonian physics in high school, and leaving school that day dumbfounded.  If all particles behave in a deterministic fashion, how is it that these particles bouncing around in my head can lead to the perception of free will and agency?  It was a question that would pursue off an on for most of the rest of my life.  Arriving at college, I dove into psychology with a passion, hoping that understanding the biomechanics of the brain would give me some clues.  I turned to computer science and was instantly drawn to AI.  I read everything I could get my hands on on the subject, with Daniel Dennett and Douglas Hofstadter being favorites of course (I still revisit Godel Escher Bach from time to time).  I even experimented with various psychedelics looking for that elusive insight that would explain things.<p>Now I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and of course I still don&#x27;t have &quot;the answer&quot;.  I&#x27;m not as consumed by the question anymore, focusing instead on just enjoying my days on earth here with my family and friends.<p>But how on earth anyone can belittle the question of consciousness blows my mind, so to speak.  :)",1421867323

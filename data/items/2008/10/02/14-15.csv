What I question is the $700 billion amount and the time frame in which the money will be used.<p>There is a lack of confidence that must be fixed. It seems like a smaller amount of money could be used to fix the confidence problem and get the ""wheels of credit"" turning again. There may also be a need to purchase some distressed securities. With confidence restored, it seems like financial institutions could step back into the picture to buy low and sell high.",1222959047

Then, instead of having on-disk indexes, on-disk caches, and on-disk temporary files, have your applications cache everything in memory-resident data structures. The operating system will automatically swap stuff in and out as necessary. The better your operating system's VM, the better the performance will be. Save explicit disk usage for things that must be persistently stored like database tablespace files.",1222958704

If I remember correctly some economist says something like ""first markets thought risk didn't exists, then they thought risk existed everywhere.""  That's the shortest most accurate description of most financial crises.<p>That's exactly what we're facing.  Frank Raines told us these (sub-prime) loans were risk free.

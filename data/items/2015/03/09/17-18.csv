I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s and have been doing this for ~20 years, so I have a bit of experience with both the new and the old world.<p>My take is that the code quality of whats allowed to be in production has gotten worse, that&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s an effect of an abundance of RAM and virtualization. The abundance of ram lets you just trash it and do things in a horribly inefficient way. Sure the extra memory can help with time memory trade off if you have something that doesnt need to scale a great deal, but processing things inline will still be faster. Developers have forgotten how to handle streams. Usually forcing a dev to learn a highly functional language that&#x27;s immutable can fix these issues (it must involve a large dataset, where you know they will tax out the memory, and then code review to help).<p>I mention virtualization because a common pattern I&#x27;ve seen is to write poor code, and just put more boxes behind the load balancer when things start failing because the technical debt is so high it&#x27;s an impossible mountain to climb. This obviously isn&#x27;t the right approach and will leave your devops guys worn out chasing your everyday distributed systems problems that happen because it wasn&#x27;t built right for distribution and the dev has never read the fallacies of distributed computing.<p>And while you&#x27;re fixing this technical debt a team of competent engineers builds a competing product and trumps you hard (second mover advantage).<p>Maybe people paid a bit more attention when things cost 10x as much as they do now and every answer (both bad and good, and you can&#x27;t tell the difference) wasn&#x27;t a stackoverflow search away.....",1425923605

It&#x27;s then much easier to go in and say &quot;Hey Bob, I&#x27;m producing twice the value you expect for this salary, work conditions have changed, so I want a significant pay raise&quot;.<p>And sometimes you have to threaten with resignation, which doesn&#x27;t really work in big companies, because there you have the &quot;cog in the machine&quot; mentality, with developers often being the bottom of the food-chain.

Simple act of promoting something very actively from the same address isn&#x27;t enough, it&#x27;s done by legitimate marketers all the time.<p>Keep in mind there are different sources of ad revenue, and there are multiple parties involved. Twitter will count an ad impression when the message is viewed &quot;above the fold&quot;, for example your iPhone Twitter app displays the promoted message in the active portion of the screen, which implies you can &quot;see&quot; it. I believe that bots do not have a significant effect on this particular type of revenue.

Absolute ownership of all land by kings/lords, where the peasants had to rent it by virtue of being born on the land.

There is simply no alternative, no place where free people can go to pursue <i>actual</i> free-association through peaceful means.

And unless there&#x27;s an investigative reporter who has built relationships with them and convinces them to talk, the public will never know what actually happened, or know what public figures are hiding.<p>The substitute for great investigative reporting isn&#x27;t necessarily bad journalism. It&#x27;s usually silence. How do you measure that? How do you know that no one wrote a story about something that you weren&#x27;t conscious of? You don&#x27;t. You&#x27;re simply unaware.

Professional Java developers are increasingly turning to the feature-rich Mac OS X as the operating system of choice for both Mac-based and cross-platform Java development projects. Mac OS X includes the full version of J2SE 1.5, pre-installed with the Java Development Kit (JDK) and the HotSpot virtual machine (VM), so you don&#x27;t have to download, install, or configure anything.<p>Deploying Java applications on Mac OS X takes advantage of many built-in features, including 64-bit support, resolution independence, automatic support of multiprocessor hardware, native support for the Java Accessibility API, and the native Aqua look and feel. As a result, Java applications on Mac OS X look and perform like native applications on Mac OS X.</i><p>[0] <a href=""http://wayback.archive.org/web/20091223033016/http://developer.apple.com/java/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wayback.archive.org/web/20091223033016/http://develop...</a>",1425921262

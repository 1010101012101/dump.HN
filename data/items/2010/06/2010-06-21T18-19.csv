I'm 20 now, and for a non CS major, have a very deep interest in programming that I can only attribute to BASIC programming.<p>If you calculate the years, I wasn't even born in the days of the commodore 64, the earliest OS I remember is Windows 3.1. But even then I was too young to comprehend what a computer was. What truly got me started was Texas Instruments.<p>7th grade: I was a TI-BASIC pro. Wielding my TI-89, I learned more about graphing calculators than any kid should have, ported existing games from TI-83 to '89s and '82s, and instead of solving tedious math problems by hand, I would write FOR loops in BASIC to do my work for me.<p>There is something truly simple and zen-like about BASIC on a calculator that makes it (imho) one of the best languages to learn ""programming"" on. In that sense I mean learning all the basics of what variables, functions, if/else statements, loops, ... etc.<p>By the time I made it to my intro to programming (Java) course in college, I barely had to go to lecture and easily pulled an A.<p>So for parents/teachers trying to get young kids into programming, get them a calculator with TI-BASIC for the following reasons:<p>* fixed screen size -- you can easily make visual ascii games and use each character as a ""pixel""<p>* full documentation = right in the back of the instruction manual!<p>* do maths! -- if nothing else, learning how to program functions to do often used math functions is reason enough<p>* community -- when I was at that age, everyone had a graphing calculator, and everyone would transfer games and programs with those little transfer cables. I became (in)famous as the kid with all the games and programs and kids would even ask me to write and port games for them. There was also a decent community online full of other people trying to program in TI-BASIC as well. I could easily program a few helpful math functions and share with my friends to help them and get that sense of instant gratification that I created something to help the world around me.<p>Hopefully the era of TI-BASIC isn't over, anyone know of the current status of graphing calculators in middle/high schools?",1277145345

If the marketplace were in charge, the people who got the service would control and be responsible for paying for it by making free and informed decisions. Instead, this is a case where regulation is in charge -- payments are made based on arbitrary rules set forth by well-meaning people. People who might read articles like this and think gee, if we only made up a few more rules, or had some really smart guys in charge of the right stuff, we could fix these other unintended consequences we made last time we mucked around. There is no need for some uber-doctor who could somehow take the place of the buyer. There is <i>nobody</i> who can effectively take the place of the buyer. That's one of the main structural problems of the system.

And one more consideration to add to that, the math of losing money is brutal.<p>For example, say you start trading with $100, have a bad day and take a 50% loss, and are down to $50.  What % gain do you need to get back $100?<p>Not 50%, as many new investors answer without thinking.  To get from $50 back to $100 requires a 100% gain.<p>If you only a 25% loss down to $75, you need a 33% gain to get from $75 back to $100.<p>If you took a 75% loss to $25, you need a 300% gain to get back to $100.<p>Given the loss, the odds of getting the gains required to break even are not good.<p>Avoiding losses is a huge part of making money trading, which is why I particularly like both <i>What I Learned</i> and Taleb's stuff.",1277143464

In most of corporate America, this is one of the primary ways to get ahead. Maybe not at the most enlightened employee focused development shops, but most programmers don’t work there.<p>There are a number of good reasons to give your current employer the opportunity to give a counteroffer:
1. It’s the polite thing to do. Even if you say no, your former boss will appreciate being given the opportunity.
2. You may be able to use it as a bargaining advantage in setting your compensation at the new job. More bidders = higher pay for you.
3. Your current employer may decide to make you a really good offer. I’ve seen it happen. They may even create a new job description that didn’t exist to accommodate you.<p>Ideally we would all work at places that properly valued our skills and contributions, and updated our salaries to reflect our value every year.

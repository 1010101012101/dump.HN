1994660,comment,1994529,1994641,0,0,pmjordan,,,"In fairness, in-place sorting usually isn't what you want in functional programming. Immutable data structures help enforce the pure functional constraints. Of course, in practice, your library code will probably make a mutable copy, sort that in-place and then return an immutable copy/representation of the result, which is hopefully more efficient. (Disclaimer: I'm no Haskell programmer; my FP experience is limited to Lisp dialects)<p>EDIT: As a curious example, Clojure's sort function actually converts the sequence to a (Java) Array and calls java.util.Arrays.sort() on it, then turns it back into a sequence:<p><a href=""https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/b578c69d7480f621841ebcafdfa98e33fcb765f6/src/clj/clojure/core.clj#L2329"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/b578c69d7480f621841e...</a>",1292068232

1994648,comment,1994529,1994606,0,0,Nitramp,,,"That's actually a nice nab for functional programmers. They run around all the time telling how nice their language of choice is, showing off quicksort in three lines of code.<p>But please don't have the audacity of pointing out that original quicksort was supposed to be an <i>efficient</i> in place sort, not a mental exercise in beauty of a language. Then you get a Haskell version that is in place, and supposedly fast. It's about 10 lines longer than the C version, uses Monads, ST, recursion, ""unsafeRead/Write"", ""rscan"", ""lscan"", ""swap"", ""sloop"", etc., all together about 20 concepts, built-in functions, etc.<p>Also, of course, if it really should be fast, you have to use several compiler hints and macros to make it type specialize and all. Obviously.<p>The C version is shorter, uses nothing but array accesses, do/while, if, int comparisons, and recursion. If you want to explain the C version to a novice programmer, it will maybe take you half a day. The <i>inplace</i> Haskell version? Uhhh, yeah.<p>I can't help it, but things like these leave me with the impression of Haskell being a theoretically really nice language whose utility in actually getting things done seems somewhat questionable.",1292067399

1994644,comment,1992278,1992278,0,0,Mz,,,"The internal subjective experience or psychology of such people is something I find of a certain interest.  Somewhat to my surprise, this article actually touches on that:<p><i>Djerassi has also suffered in his own work because of monomaths’ hostility, especially as a playwright. “They always keep crying out ‘the co-inventor, father, the mother of the Pill’,” he growls. “Without having any knowledge about the play, they start with it. As if it’s got anything to do with it.” Djerassi thinks that this means he has to work harder to promote his work. “No agent has ever been interested in me. They want 29-year-old Irish playwrights, not 86-year-old expatriates.” A trace of bitterness creeps into his voice, but he concedes: “If I were an agent I’d feel the same way.”<p>Overwhelmed by specialists and attacked by experts as dilettantes, it is amazing that there are any polymaths at all.

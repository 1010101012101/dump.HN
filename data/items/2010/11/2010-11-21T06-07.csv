1926557,comment,1926402,1926402,0,0,SkyMarshal,,,"I just started reading Land of Lisp today, and the first chapter has exactly this discussion.  Hope Conrad Barski, the author and HN reader, doesn't mind if I repost the excerpt here.<p><i>Land of Lisp</i>, ps 16-17:<p><a href=""http://landoflisp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://landoflisp.com/</a><p><i>""A Tale of Two Lisps<p>Some deep philosophical differences exist between ANSI Common Lisp and Scheme, and they appeal to different programmer personalities. Once you learn more about Lisp languages, you can decide which dialect you prefer. There is no right or wrong choice.<p>To aid you in your decision, I have created the following personality test for you:<p>A.  (drawing of a mean looking wolf)<p>B.  (drawing of a tranquil sheep)<p>C.  (drawing of the wolf in the sheep's clothing)<p>If you chose A, you like raw power in your language. You don’t mind if your language is a bit ugly, due to a lot of pragmatic compromises, as long as you can still write tight code. ANSI Common Lisp is the best language for you! ANSI Common Lisp traces its ancestry most directly from the ancient Lisp dialects, built on top of millions of programmer hours, giving it incredibly rich functionality. Sure, it has some baroque function names due to countless historical accidents, but this Lisp can really fly in the right hacker’s hands.<p>If you chose B, you like languages that are clean and elegant. You are more interested in fundamental programming problems and are happy to while away on a beautiful meadow, contemplating the beauty of your code, occasionally writing a research paper on theoretical computing problems.  Scheme is the language for you! It was created in the mid-1970s by Guy L. Steele and Gerald Jay Sussman and involved some soul-searching about the ideal Lisp. Code in Scheme tends to be slightly more verbose, since Schemers care more about mathematical purity in their code than creating the shortest programs possible.<p>If you chose C, you’re someone who wants it all: the power of ANSI CL and the mathematical beauty of Scheme. At this time, no Lisp dialect completely fits the bill, but that could change in the future.  One language that might work for you (although it is sacrilege to make this claim in a Lisp book) is Haskell. It is not considered a Lisp dialect, but its followers obey paradigms popular among Lispers, such as keeping the syntax uniform, supporting native lists, and relying heavily on higher-order functions. More important, it has an extreme mathematical rigor (even more so than Scheme) that allows it to hide very powerful functionality under a squeaky clean surface. It’s essentially a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Like Lisp, Haskell is a language that any programmer would benefit from investigating further.<p>Up-and-Coming Lisps<p>As just mentioned, there really isn’t a true Lisp dialect available yet that possesses both the power and flexibility of ANSI Common Lisp and the elegance of Scheme. However, some new contenders on the horizon may attain the best-of-both-worlds crown in the near future.<p>One new Lisp that is showing promise is Clojure, a dialect developed by Rich Hickey. Clojure is built on the Java platform, allowing it to leverage a lot of mature Java libraries right out of the box. Also, Clojure contains some clever and well-thought-out features to ease multithreaded programming, which makes it a useful tool for programming seemingly ubiquitous multicore CPUs.<p>Another interesting challenger is Arc. It is a true Lisp language being principally developed by Paul Graham, a well-known Lisper. Arc is still in an early stage of development, and opinion varies widely on how much of an improvement it is over other Lisps. Also, its development has been progressing at a glacially slow pace. It will be a while before anyone can say if Arc might be a meaningful contender.<p>We’ll be dipping our toes in some Arc and Clojure in the epilogue.""</i>",1290322500

For anyone who's taken the CS Subject Test, can I get your thoughts? How difficult was it for you, what types of questions seem to show up a lot, and in lieu of CS coursework what type of preparation would you recommend as most effective?<p>I have all the basic algorithms/data structures knowledge (or at least, I don't know what I don't know), as well as experience in different types of programming languages (from C++ to C#/VB.NET and Python and now Haskell.)

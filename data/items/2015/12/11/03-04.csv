10715347,comment,10712739,10715066,0,0,avar,,,"I think you&#x27;re falling for the fallacy of assigning political opinions to a one-dimensional spectrum of liberal v.s. conservative, and doubly so by asserting that your opinion on a given issue can only be caused by being on one end of that spectrum.<p>Even if you assume a one-dimensional political spectrum there&#x27;s plenty of reasons for why someone might by for or against immigration for any number of reasons.<p>For simplicity&#x27;s sake let&#x27;s use the stereotypical US definitions of conservative and liberal, even then you can find plenty of reasons on both sides to be for and against immigration.<p>You could be conservative and be for it because you&#x27;re a business owner and it implies cheap labor, or against it because you&#x27;re also a xenophobe and just don&#x27;t like people from other countries.<p>You could be for it as a liberal because you believe in some pan-nationalistic idea of humanity without borders, or against it because you think the influx of cheap labor will ultimately create a lower class within society which interferes with the project of a socialist state.<p>You mentioned Scotland as an example among the rise of the rise of right-wing ideals in Europe. I think it&#x27;s entirely unrealistic to mention that in the same paragraph as nationalism leading to &quot;massacres, and other oppression&quot;. If anything bad things might happen because Scotland is being denied national autonomy, just look at what&#x27;s been happening in Ireland.<p>Sometimes people just want to do their own thing in their own little piece of the planet. I myself am from Iceland which has a long history of a nationalist movement that has nothing to do with any of that stuff. Sometimes people just want a bit of self-determinism without negatively impacting others. Ascribing that desire to left or right or conservative or liberal is a gross and inaccurate oversimplification.",1449805896

10715340,comment,10712739,10714734,0,0,cmurf,,,"Nationalism has a strong component of devotion, an emotional attachment, to the state. Its a derivative of statism, which itself is a derivative of tribalism. You can have either liberals or conservatives subject to such an emotional appeal to the state. Due to the strong emotional appeal in nationalism, the political ideology is more nuanced. In classic liberalism, power comes from the individual who then grants a revocable delegation of that power to form a state (government). In conservatism, power comes more broadly from society, culture, and affinity for stability. The Bolshevik revolution is an example of a left of center revolution, it certainly was nativist, nationalist, and was not conservative. The Cultural Revolution, likewise a left of center revolution, its ideology was very centered on empowering the individual, it was nationalistic, nativist (the purging of &quot;impure elements&quot; of Chinese society), and certainly not conservative.<p>There are many examples of liberal and conservative nationalist movements. I think it requires some research to demonstrate if one or the other is more inclined to nationalism, or jingoism.",1449805828

The only way to guarantee good generalization outside one&#x27;s training set is to have a lot of data compared to the number of degrees of freedom in the model.<p>To avoid this, we use bias/prior/regularization which reduces the effective number of degrees of freedom. For example, fitting a quadratic polynomial to some data, we have 3 degrees of freedom including the constant term. If I add a regularization term \lambda*||a|| where a is the vector of coefficients, I can alleviate overfitting. We can determine an optimal value for \lambda using validation or cross-validation. For \lambda=0, we have 3 parameters. As \lambda->infinity, we force the answer closer and closer to the constant 0 polynomial ie. no degrees of freedom.<p>In other words, regularization avoids overfitting by reducing the dimension of the model.<p>I am not worried about the amount of data I have to carry around; rather, it was a way of thinking about the dimension of parameter-space.<p>Don&#x27;t big alarm bells go off in your head when you hear N parameters for N data points?",1449805823

But part of that is that they are a very old topic (you can see Gauss referring to them in slide 22 of <a href=""http://math.iit.edu/~fass/590/notes/Notes590_Ch1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://math.iit.edu/~fass/590/notes/Notes590_Ch1.pdf</a>).  I think that kinda prevents funding agencies from pushing too hard for research into them, since there is a more likely quick return on investment into a new topic.  And I don&#x27;t begrudge them that - funding should be given to people with new ideas which have the potential to revolutionize things.  I&#x27;d also mention that there are people trying to bridge the gap between how GPs work and the benefits of neural nets (<a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05700"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05700</a>).<p>Probably another thing holding them back is their high barrier to entry - you can&#x27;t do much with the theory of kernels unless you know statistics and functional analysis (and of course numerical analysis and linear algebra,) which is one of the reasons I had difficulty finding research students.  To draw a parallel to numerical analysis (where I am much more comfortable than machine learning,) this is why finite element methods are much more popular than, say, boundary element methods for PDEs, despite the fact that boundary element methods are better in many circumstances.  But when implementing things, especially in industry, simplicity and robustness count for something and those are not strong points of kernels.<p>But kernels haven&#x27;t gone anywhere yet, and they&#x27;ve been fundamental to analysis since at least David Hilbert, so they are not going anywhere any time soon.  Deep learning ... we&#x27;ll see.  Maybe it has the legs to stick around or maybe it&#x27;ll be swept aside by the next hot thing.  8 years ago all the research funding was going into uncertainty quantification, 5 years ago compressed sensing was the hot idea (thanks Terry Tao,) and now deep learning is going to light the world on fire.  All of those are, and should be, hotter topics than kernels, but we&#x27;ll see what we&#x27;re talking about in 5 years.  It won&#x27;t be kernels (unless something crazy happens and I become the leader of the US, in which case I have a great idea for a new reality show) but I don&#x27;t know that it will be deep learning either.",1449802834

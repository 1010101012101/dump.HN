Initially I thought that vim is for hipster nerds who would rather use something awkward and completely ignore some useful mainstream stuff like arrow keys and a mouse.<p>Later I've developed a wrist pain and got interested in ergonomics. One thing I've noticed was how badly the arrow keys are positioned and how ""unhealthy"" it is to use a mouse with a right hand (numpad shifts the position of a mouse too far right). And then I started thinking about minimising use of a mouse and arrow keys. This led to the rediscovering of vim.<p>It was surprisingly easy to learn and later surprisingly hard to use other editors.",1363874316

5414997,comment,5404452,5411902,2,0,ssmoot,,,"Favoring Ruby over Scala... Insanity! ;-)<p>But seriously, maybe your friend just wasn't all that well versed in Scala. I'm no pro (yet), but on the topic of Utility functions, I haven't run across any big holes. The Collections API is very Fluent (in the Martin Fowler terminology describing Ruby's Array), so it's hard to fault that. In fact, it goes quite a bit farther.<p>You have Option, Try, Either to use FP in a way Ruby-only programmers probably won't ever grasp. I certainly didn't. I've never seen any real Ruby code that comes close to a foldMap (foldLeft(Tuple2[Accumulator, Map])), or a Try pattern match, or (you could go on and on...).<p>Templating I don't get unless you're wed to HAML maybe. There are similar libraries for Scala, but it's hard for me to imagine someone being able to compare Twirl (Play's templating) to ERb and declaring ERb superior on <i>any</i> metric. Twirl is arguably simpler, definitely far faster, has no identifiable magic, and Scala+Twirl makes it silly easy to avoid a whole class of common problems with branching logic (hello id=4 my old friend!).<p>Play has First Class Forms. Rails doesn't. I'm sure Rails will some day. Declarative data binding is simply better. Safer, simpler, provable correctness.<p>I'd give Play a second look. :-)<p>To be fair, the one gap I've come across is in String manipulation. A few minutes of googling and a little tweaking and I've got a quick slugging function though: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/sam/5213151"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/sam/5213151</a><p>And then there's stuff like writing:<p><pre><code>  10 seconds
</code></pre>
Which makes me giggle a little inside every time I write it. :-D<p>On the other end of the spectrum, there's all the things Play gives you Rails doesn't: Futures. Actors. Async. Chunked Responses (which maybe Rails 5 will have?). WebSockets. Awesome XML (it's nice to use a lib that does not suck if you have to deal with it). Better JSON support. Functional Programming. Pattern Matching. Performance. Built in (Memory) Cache Concurrency. Functional Testing with Selenium. A built-in production ready web-server. Continuous Testing. Deployment Packaging. Bootstrap. LESS compilation. SBT: A single tool that provides file system watchers, Tasks, compilation, packaging, dependencies (including Git). All the JARs a Jar Jar could Jar if a Jar Jar could Jar Jars.<p>The only significant downsides I've run into are:<p>1. Sharing your code as a package is harder. Much harder. Nexus isn't nearly as low friction as rubygems.org.
2. Binary Compatibility concerns means sometimes your best option is a source dependency.<p>Git dependencies have been a good solution to #1 for me so far, but I know the day will come when I'll have to figure out hosting on Maven Central.",1363874078

5414962,comment,5411811,5411811,1,0,davesims,,,"I've been meaning to learn vim for years now. I started a month ago knowing basically how to fudge my way around with arrow keys and save with :w, and that's it. A couple of peepcode screencasts, a bit of daily 5 minute practice on shortcutfoo.com, and a month of pretty disciplined day-to-day coding later and I'm basically back to where I was on TextMate. I'm even using a tmux/vim setup for most of my Android coding, occasionally tabbing back into IntelliJ IDEA if I have to do any heavy refactoring, and even then I have a vim plugin going there.<p>Is it better? I dunno, hard to say. I <i>like</i> it. I like the tmux-vim combination and it's been a good challenge that's kept my brain engaged.<p>Now, I have a <i>ton</i> to learn, and that's awesome. But I'm at the point where I'm really comfortable making all of my changes in a vim context, without constant finger stuttering and 3 second pauses like I was doing 3 weeks ago. And it <i>certainly</i> didn't take me 2 years. That's nuts. Maybe 5 years ago before there were so many screencasts, tutorials and practice sites, it may have taken that long. But even then I think any disciplined coder could get up to a moderate proficiency with some daily practice, in a few weeks or months, not years.<p>This is an old warhorse of a debate that hardly seems worthy of HN, nevertheless here is the conventional wisdom restated: vim vs. idea vs. TM/ST is a question of taste and personal developer happiness, not proven productivity. I know great coders who swear by (EMacs/Vim/IntelliJ/Eclipse/SublimeText) to the exclusion of all others. None of it matters. Was it Knuth who said, ""all editor wars lead to madness and early optimization"", or something to that effect?",1363873729

On ebay I pay for ""Buy it Now"" listings ($0.50 insertion) and 11% final value fee. So for me the cost is going to drop by 1% and .50 cents.<p>eBay is doing this to compete and catch up to Amazon. Auctions are a fad on their way out, and ""buy it now"" is where it's all at. Store style.<p>Amazon fees are MUCH worse than ebay + paypal fees combined, btw. Plus on Amazon you can't have calculated shipping so you have to buffer your shipping. I had to lie about my calendar weighing 4lbs just so I can force Amazon to calculate shipping more fairly. So sometimes you lose some money and sometimes you win. While on eBay calculated shipping charges buyers based on dimensions, weight, and destination so you charge your buyer the exact shipping cost down to the penny.<p>The problem with the OLD ebay rates is that they discouraged people from posting ""Buy It Now"" items. There's a barrier to entry. If you wanted to sell, lets say, 10 products on ebay with a ""buy it now"" price you had to pay 0.50/listing (not per item or sale) and they would be on there for a month /or/ until that item's quantity reached Zero and sold out. Now, you can put up to 50 items on ebay for free.<p>Ebay's old prices favored Auctions, ebay's new prices favor store style listings. It's now cheaper to start a store on ebay.",1363873688

You are his patron, reminding him of his place. This is not civility.  This is the literal definition of condescension.<p>Civility doesn't mean avoiding hyperbole or other effective rhetoric.  Civility means keeping a debate about the subject rather than the individuals discussing.  You failed to do that.<p>From ""Civility in Public Discourse""[1]:<p><i>Clearly, civility has to mean something more that mere politeness. The movement will have accomplished little if all it does is get people to say, ""excuse me please"", while they (figuratively) stab you in the back. Civility also cannot mean ""roll over and play dead."" People need to be able to raise tough questions and present their cases when they feel their vital interests are being threatened. A civil society cannot avoid tough but important issues, simply because they are unpleasant to address.</i><p>You avoided the tough questions, and changed the subject from the identified issues.<p><i>Constructive debate needs to focus on solutions which are most likely to be successful, and not upon personal attacks leveled by adversaries against one another.</i><p>He used hyperbole for effect, about the <i>process</i> of using the tool, not about the interlocutor.  That didn't undermine civility by this canonical definition.  You attacked his tone, personalizing the discussion.  That did undermine civility.<p><i>Constructive civil debate, therefore, requires that the parties work together to resolve factual disagreements wherever possible.</i><p>He spent time walking through a process, factually. You ignored the facts, and replied about civility instead. That was not working together.<p><i>The most destructive confrontation process, escalation, arises when accidental or intentional provocations beget greater counter-provocations in an intensifying cycle that transforms a substantive debate characterized by honest problem solving into one in which mutual hatred becomes the primary motive. De-escalation and escalation avoidance strategies are needed to limit this problem.</i><p>His post was effective at highlighting the real <i>user story</i> about trying to get started with the platform.<p>And though you yourself use sarcasm about other products like backbone.js in a piece presented as a canonical getting started reference, your dismissive line escalated the situation into a Streisand effect turning off countless potential users of the framework.<p>You could have at least not replied at all, as a more civil response than what you wrote.<p><i>One crucial element of civility is recognition by conflicting parties that it is possible that they are wrong and that the policies advocated by their opponents are actually better. This entails an obligation to seriously consider the persuasive arguments made by opponents.</i><p>You did not seriously consider the persuasive arguments made by the OP, you attacked his tone instead.<p>Here on HN, you've demonstrated unwillingness to acknowledge, even by a single phrase, that you might have been wrong and policies around civil discourse suggested by others here might have been preferable in this instance.  Elsewhere you've jumped on people trying to get into the framework, so this personalizing criticism of the framework isn't new.<p>Thankfully, a careful reading of this HN thread suggests contributors to ember.js disagree with you, and have suggested your response was a tired mistake.  So perhaps readers here can still agree not just with the philosophy of ember.js itself, but with the philosophy of its contributors.  That's important, and missing that point can cost a project dearly.<p>TLDR:<p>By most of your replies here, it seems you've confused pleasantries with the real meaning of ""civil discourse"" which can be quite spirited or contentious but <i>remains focused on framing the identified issues</i> in ways which transform win-lose confrontations into win-win opportunities.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.colorado.edu/conflict/civility.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.colorado.edu/conflict/civility.htm</a>",1363873155

A metallic bond is not so directional, and you typically thing of all the molecules in a metal as a big blob with a cloud of electrons that can freely move about (also the reason for good electrical conductivity).<p>There are ""elastic"" and ""plastic"" deformations.  Think about bending a paperclip.  Use it gently, and you can open it up and get it to squeeze a few papers together.  Pull it off and it returns to its original shape.  That's elastic. Now open it wider or bend it into another shape, and it will no longer return to the original shape.  That's a plastic deformation.<p>Metals can deform plastically which means layers of atoms are sliding past one another in waves.  Sometimes these waves are stopped by various irregularities in the crystal lattice.  The waves start to pile up, preventing further plastic deformation.  Keep bending that paperclip back and forth; it will eventually snap.  But in the meantime, it absorbed a fair amount of energy.  That's ""toughness"".<p>In a ceramic, the electrons are not free to move about.  If a crack develops, it doesn't take much for there to be terrific stress at the tip of the crack (much like a lever and fulcrum).  The crack propagates through the material, and you have catastrophic failure.<p>There are various ways to increase the toughness of ceramics.  I'm not all that familiar with them, but a common one is Yttria-stabilized zirconia.  That's zirconium oxide with added yttrium.  Under stress from a crack, the material can undergo a phase transformation (from one crystal structure to another; not solid to liquid or anything like that). A phase transformation absorbs energy (just like boiling water into steam does) which may be enough to stop the crack from propagating.  My ceramics professor had a YSZ hammer that was gifted to him by Coors ceramics (same family as the beer company). YSZ is not transparent however.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yttria-stabilized_zirconia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yttria-stabilized_zirconia</a>",1363870835

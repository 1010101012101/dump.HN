I&#x27;m going to bet writing apps for this kit will be a <i>lot of fun</i>.<p>And all the C# .NET developers can say again, <i>thank you Microsoft</i> since they have committed to one platform, one store, all device types. I think it will be a while yet before there are thousands of developers working on this, but it will grow exponentially for a while.<p>If this is comfortable for extended wear, it&#x27;s just going to further increase the value of remote workers. You can&#x27;t beat time zones, but for everything else, there&#x27;s holograms.<p>I really, really want to understand how high fidelity this is.<p>One point is we aren&#x27;t seeing it used for video conferencing between two people each wearing a band. Probably because face-on you look pretty silly in it. So it&#x27;s not quite a natural way to meet people. Just yet. I think it has world changing potential.<p>But in 2016 or whenever, this will not be selling for $499 or $899, it&#x27;s more like $3299 I would guess. And really, that&#x27;s more like the price level we expect for a very high quality gear. Actually, you could realistically go upward of $10k if the quality truly reflects that price.<p>So of course the next thing I did was check MSFT stock price. $382 billion market cap. This is a $100 billion idea, might be a good time to get back in. I guarantee you, the market has not fully priced in holograms. Just saying it, you know it&#x27;s true.

Generally the last good stretch of Seagate drives was just before 750GB was the top size.<p>When the drives started reaching 1TB capacity... There were models where they started throwing Seagate branded drives into Maxtor external cases... And that was when it all went to shit. The infamous 7200.11 series.<p>Dealing with the 7200.11 drives was like the capacitor plague. They seemed to work well long enough to get other people to buy loads... then the firmware problems... then the sudden head crash problems... then the sudden won&#x27;t power up anymore after a reboot problems...<p>All the same kind of shit that people saw with Maxtor post 2GB that caused people to stop using those drives en masse. Those old 2GB Maxtor drives were reliable as fuck, though.<p>I&#x27;d normally end something like this with a bit about how history repeats itself and I fear for the next drive company that will get bought out by Seagate, but when you look at it... We&#x27;re down to two with a small smattering of subsidiaries that no one can really be sure are rebrands or proper made drives.<p>Case in point. Hitachi is owned by WD and Samsung HD is owned by Seagate now. Toshiba owns some WD assets and bought out Fujitsu&#x27;s HD division. Beyond that, not much left.",1421927746

His applauding of fear was (presumably) in response to Rachel Feltman&#x27;s (WashingtonPost&#x27;s journalist) &quot;a bad thing&quot; appraisal of her lack of fear during those two incidents of being held at knifepoint and those two other incidents of being held at gunpoint. Whereas you completely miss the point I was trying to make. That, it matters not that in her entire lifetime she failed to feel afraid in those four instances (of being held at knifepoint or gunpoint) -- and we do not yet know if she actually handled them intelligently or not (i.e., had the time and energy to think through her responses instead of them being, say, flippantly knee-jerk) -- as they are nothing in the large scheme of an entire of life of being mostly happy. Say, she has lived for some 50 years with this condition, then she has been happy the whole 45 years. An ordinary &quot;healthy person&quot; would have been happy say 25 years with ordinary &quot;healthy&quot; incidents of fear, even trauma, peppered throughout their lifetime.<p>> She describes herself to be happy 9 out of 10 times because she is also unable to notice the real dangers [...]<p>What &#x27;real dangers&#x27; are they (other than the four incidences noted above)?<p>> [...] real dangers that fear is there to help us handle.<p>How exactly does fear help you handle &#x27;real dangers&#x27;? It seems that SM had no trouble handling those four incidents (of being held at knifepoint or gunpoint) admirably. Most &quot;healthy people&quot; on the other hand would cringe/freeze and even develop &quot;traumas&quot;, much less have the energy to think through their responses.<p>> While it may be great to not feel afraid, as the article points out it also leads her to risky behaviour that most healthy persons would avoid.<p>You are merely speculating trying to justify your fear of lack of fear, unless by &#x27;risky behaviour&#x27; you only refer to those four incidents (of being held at knifepoint or gunpoint) which this women seems to have handled admirably.<p>Being fearless is indeed under appreciated, even at HN.",1421927035

Web applications--high functionality, low content (as opposed to web sites--low functionality, high content) have struggled with the limitations of the static, stateless document paradigm for years and is the real use-case for client side templating as an answer to one of the many resulting challenges.<p>When a page is highly dynamic in response to interaction, it is equally stupid and wasteful to perform full page refreshes. Request, server compile, download, flow, paint. Bad. Slow, discontinuous.<p>Someone else mentioned UX being ignored in the quest for client side templates: no, wrong. Client side templates are at least 50% about UX. We have a DOM already there, let&#x27;s use it. But that is also exactly the problem with the all-client mode: it delivers something several extra steps removed from being a useful (to the user) DOM when it <i>could</i> do otherwise and when doing otherwise would result in a better and more universally performant user experience.<p>Right now, truly smart isomorphic templates are what we need.

With the original engine, it sounded impressive, perhaps more so than the engine actually was.<p>Not long after I got the truck, the original 305ci engine gave up the ghost (it had over 400,000 miles so it had had a great run) and I had a 350ci engine built for it and installed. None of the pipes were changed, and the exhaust manifold was a factory fit version for that new engine, not custom headers. Still, the sound difference was night and day. Now the truck positively thunders, where it merely growled before. While a lot of its sound can be attributed to the custom pipes and muffler, a lot of it is in the engine too.<p>To me, it&#x27;s similar to the difference between a miked acoustic guitar and an acoustic-electric.

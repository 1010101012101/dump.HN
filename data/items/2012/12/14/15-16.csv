What I have seen is a lot of ignoring and rejecting attempts.<p>Miguel de Icaza had a blog post on this I think. The problem with large opensource projects is that they have a lot to do, and simply don't have time to thoroughly follow up on all the small contributions that are ridden with naieve errors and plain formatting issues. Not to mention the big ones that come with architectural changes without explanations.<p>I think it's unfair to call these charity workers jerks, just because they are trying to make light of a dire situation.<p>Yes it can hurt if your contribution is coldly cast aside, and yes it would be much better if they warmly took you in and taught you in their ways, but if the OSS project leaders don't keep up the constant stream of contributions, improving the project all the time the project will die and all work will have been in vain.<p>On a side note: which project will you be contributing to this christmas?

For the longest time I wondered why so many apparently sane people were addicted to a specific sports team or would spend tons of money to own a jersey with their favorite player's number.<p>Then I learned about mirror neurons. The human brain has been shown through functional MRI studies to 'mirror' emotions that are watched. Speculation suggests this evolved as a way for one person to empathize with another's situation. How does this relate to sports? It turns out that if you're watching someone hit a home run at the crucial moment in the game your brain gives you a little 'hit' of the same emotion that actual player is feeling. In other words, people who love watching sports have a physical reaction that makes them feel the highs and lows of the players.<p>I no longer assume that people addicted to sports are just in it for the beer.",1355500563

4921440,comment,4920831,4920995,9,0,karl_gluck,,,"I actually wrote some code to find unbalanced braces in the codebase I was maintaining at work.  One big downside of Tcl is that the parser gives you practically no help with syntax errors--never a line number, and only sometimes does it give you context.<p>Another common mistake is that curly brackets are VERY significant in [expr].  The author writes statements like ""expr $i * $i"" in several places, and it makes me cringe for two reasons:<p>1- This code prints ""5"" because expr does a double-substitution:<p><pre><code>  set a 5\n  set b {$a}\n  puts [expr $b*1+0]\n\n</code></pre>\nWhat's going on here is that $b is evaluated (to the string ""$a"") before calling expr, then expr itself evaluates its argument:<p><pre><code>   $a*1+0\n</code></pre>\nto 5.  This is a problem because $b can be anything--for example, a call to [eval] arbitrary code.<p>2- Calling expr without putting braces around the argument is unfathomably slow.  Tcl precompiles procedures as much as possible, and calls to functions requiring dynamic evaluation (like eval or expr without braces) can't be precompiled.<p>I once solved a huge performance problem by finding and fixing calls to expr made without braces.  What was a process that took 40+ hours to finish was reduced to around 45 minutes by this change alone.<p><i>edit: formatting</i>",1355499945

In the past I have found when I copy the code it is essentially a copy-paste level of thinking (i.e. none at all) that takes longer.  There are times when I feel that when I am typing out example code I pay <i>less</i> attention than when I copy paste.  When I copy/paste, I at least usually try to look for the important parts of what is going on, but when I am typing it out, I am too focused on making sure I have a comma instead of a period, or matching parentheses, etc.  And not to mention I tend to leave out comments that probably should be there in the interest of being sick of typing.<p>To be fair the case I am imagining myself in is the times I have looked up something relatively simple like opening a socket or something pretty mundane, so this may not apply to all situations.",1355499856

The downside is that it adds complexity to code generation and some overhead to functions with exception handlers, but the upside is that you have a far more robust exceptions system, and you have an opportunity to add a very nice feature that can help a lot with encapsulation:  restarts.<p>Since you asked for examples, I'll point to the Common Lisp ""conditions"" system, which includes restarts:<p><a href=""http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/beyond-exception-handling-conditions-and-restarts.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/beyond-exception-handling-co...</a><p>(I'll be honest here and point out that ""handler-case,"" while simpler and more convenient, can still have a double exception fault; this is resolved similar to how Java resolves such things, which is to ""forget"" one of the exceptions.

There are at least a couple of things wrong with this sentiment:<p>(1) if you really believe that, then you would have no problem with a group of strangers searching your house, your bank records, safety deposit boxes, all your digital assets, etc.  And by ""etc"" I mean also strip searching your family members or loved ones if ""necessary"".

Who gets to decide how far is too far?<p>(2) And you might respond, ""but these aren't strangers searching my stuff and family, these are duly authorized government officials.""  Well, duly authorized government officials are flawed human beings like all of us, and the ones doing the searching are most likely not elected by anyone.<p>And also, these people in power at the moment, whose motives you trust, will most definitely not be in power forever.

4921284,comment,4920657,4920657,2,0,bmelton,,,"So, I like the idea of a Svbtle-like blogging platform (and recently launched a closed beta of something vaguely like this, but not really very like this at all), but I think that there are a few cases where this misses the point.<p>I think the signup page asks for far too much.  First name, last name, email are fine, but then it asks for profession, icon, bio and a network color.  I don't even know what a network color is, and I don't see that anywhere that it is explained.<p>The admin panel has a few inconsistent UI choices and I think falls victim to the notion that a simple color palette = minimalism.  The writing panel is cluttered in my opinion, and doesn't seem to have had much thought put into it aside from copying what Svbtle has publicized.  That isn't necessarily horrible as an MVP of course, but this doesn't show any improvement or uniqueness.  That also isn't a crime, but I think that the changes made for the sake of being different were just that, and weren't evaluated for placement or use case studies.<p>This may seem overly critical, but it isn't intended to be so, but I think this shows telltale signs of being a copycat without having given much thought to the reasons WHY Svbtle is so appealing.<p>To paraphrase somebody (perhaps Kevin Smith) -- the reasons that most (movie) sequels fail are because they're copying the wrong thing.  Most people look at Jaws and see a shark and a boat, but in reality, there's a love story there, there are ties of camaraderie, a tale of obsession, yadda yadda.  Remakes capture the bit about the shark, and not much else, and I feel that's where this is falling down.<p>That isn't to say that it can't be turned around, but I recommend to the author to watch how people use it and try to make some decisions that aren't based on the Svbtle screenshots.<p>It's a good-looking project that shipped, and I feel like a lot of the criticism here isn't terribly constructive, and I hope that this is (but maybe it isn't).  Grats to the author and good luck, but I think that the path to success is maybe a little more involved.",1355498405

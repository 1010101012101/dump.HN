Leader of a tech team at a leading company.<p>Derrida and David Foster Wallace were technically more challenging to my intelligence than what I do now.  Don't get me wrong, I love my job, and it is <i>not</i> easy!  But it is pretty entertaining (bordering on insulting) to see engineers huff and gruff that no one but engineers can be engineers.  There's this weird rift in the developer world where only CS degrees are respected or only wunderkinds who dropped out of high school in their freshman year at a prestigious university are real engineers and everyone else is unworthy of the title.  I suppose it is partly because it is a threat to the specialization of engineers (how can someone four years behind me be as good: impossible!).  In my experience, however, some of the best people I have worked with are doing something <i>other</i> than what their degree is in because they are curious people who are passionate about lots of things and picked one in college because they had to for the sake of a major.  Lots of people happen to be good with both sides of their brain.",1355504385

I've seen this type of attitude from F/OSS ""leaders"" over the past couple of decades, and it always galls me to no end.<p>This is why I commit (no pun intended) to try my best to <i>not</i> be like that with any of my projects.  Now, to be fair, none of the Fogbeam projects have a lot of outside contributions to date, but every time someone has contacted me, I've tried to respond in a polite, reasonable and appropriate manner.<p>One thing to consider, when interacting with people you don't know, is that <i>you don't know</i> what you're possibly getting.  We got a request once, for permission to take our code, make it work with MySql, and use it for some academic research.  Now that was already allowed by the license anyway, but I took the time to respond to the guy, and had a few chat/email interactions with him as worked on his project, even though I had no idea who he was, how important the project was, or if anything would ever come of it.  A year or so later, I get an email saying ""Hey, here's a pre-print of the paper we published, it's being presented at $PRESTIGIOUS_CONFERENCE, and we mention your project in the paper"".  That turns out to be a nice ""feather in the bonnet"" for us and helped get the project some visibility it would not have gotten otherwise.<p>Honestly, I don't see any value in being dismissive, insulting or demeaning towards anyone, just because they aren't already an expert in your project.",1355504317

4921855,comment,4921561,4921561,19,0,simonsarris,,,"I have a dual degree in Computer Science and Philosophy[1] (graduated 2010).<p>In every interview I had people pointed to the Philosophy part of my degree as a quaint curiousity and asked about it. I told of how I love writing and debate, and I think that effective communication is one of the most important and understated concepts in every scientific profession.<p>I love Computer Science but I <i>really</i> love writing and ethics[2] and conversation. I love communication and the art (and science) of effectively conveying ideas. I'd probably love advertising, to be honest.<p>If I had to do college all over again I'd probably try to do English/Philosophy/CS, with perhaps CS as the minor. I have <i>enormous</i> respect for liberal arts majors, but more-so than other majors, and I think this is very important, the value of humanities degrees are <i>very much what you put into them.</i> It didn't seem hard in my school at least to get a Phil/Communications/English degree compared to a STEM degree, but that in itself only meant that what you got out of a humanities degree was entirely based on your input, and there was a lot of input to be had. I definitely found humanities majors vastly more socially capable than the engineer majors, almost to an embarrassing degree.[3]<p>Anyway I do think that CS and any communication/writing-intensive major compliment each other grandly. It seems only natural, especially with the intersection of logic in Philosophy or clear composition in English. But I also think these majors compliment CS because I think the largest deficiency in every other CS and engineering grad I've met is that they have a hard time communicating their ideas and debating others effectively. English and Philosophy (and any writing in general) help with that. A lot, in my opinion.<p>I had 12 years of Catholic Schooling and they stressed the hell out of essay writing. Composition composition composition. Looking back, I feel that was a really important thing, and it made all of us better people, in terms of relating and communicating.<p>In fact, and I think this is the most important takeaway from my silly ramblings here, I think that <i>writing</i> and writing a lot makes you more a more empathetic person. I think that the more you have to put down your ideas to explain or persuade other people in a medium that you can look back on, the more you will have to consider and understand other points of view. Doubly so if you are required to write about topics that you may not be fanatic about. Anyone can write an argument about why, say, PHP sucks (or not) without getting much out of it for themselves, since they are just puking their zeal onto paper  (or pixels) and probably don't give all too much thought to really convincing people. But having to consider things that you aren't already a true believer in takes a lot of nuance and brain-turning. I think, anyway.<p>[1] <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/6oTix.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/6oTix.jpg</a><p>[2] in the Aristotelian/Kant/Mill/Humanity's greater good/etc sense of the word, not the vague-ideas-gotten-by-parents-and-peers sense which is usually picked up on (see for instance almost the entire abortion debate)<p>[3] I'm quite the introvert and it took me a long time to overcome the social interaction thing that seemed to plague so many of my peers in college. I was <i>supremely</i> shy as a kid and tended to hide behind my mom whenever we went somewhere. My 8th grade class was just 21 people (two groups of 10 and 11), and my high school was just 500-600 people. Going in to college I was unused to, well, interaction.<p>In my freshman year of college it all hit me. My college (RPI) was known for being an introverted place and I met so many great people who almost literally never left their rooms. Great minds and personalities who were self-sequestered from the world.<p>It felt tragic sometimes. I met and found a lot of people wanted to meet people but had a great fear of simply being in public spaces more and exchanging pleasantries. Others still, and this was not an uncommon opinion, would disparage the idea of small talk as useless. It's funny but, of all places, once I came to college and met enough varied and amazing people I became vastly, vastly less shy. It just wasn't worth it to be shy when there were so many great people to meet.",1355504158

4921809,comment,4921234,4921556,4,0,adventured,,,"A few things<p>1) The start button menu has a built in search function that makes the search typing function in the start screen pointless - if I want to use the search approach. It responds in real time just like the start screen search does as well. And importantly: no need to switch visual interfaces to get to the program search. Windows key > type, all inside the desktop visual mode.<p>2) I use a two-pronged approach to pinning programs. First, I pin everything I use for work to the taskbar, so that's one click and no typing or start screen visual switching (which is obnoxious to work flow). Then some slightly less frequently used programs I pin to the first layer of the start button menu, so that's two clicks (to launch) and no typing to access another ten or so programs (20 programs, in one or two clicks, no switching screens and no typing; covers 99% of what I use daily). And if I want to, I can obviously use a key approach to opening the start button menu as well. Windows key > start typing, initiates a search, or an arrow key tap upward rolls me into the program list or into my pinned group. All from the same interface, without a visual switch.<p>3) With the start button menu I get a very fast alphabetical listing of practically everything on my system. Tiles take up considerably more space and require a left / right roll to see everything. It's cute for a few items, it's obnoxious and messy for 50.<p>4) The start button menu has a settings section that I can roll over to a control panel sub list or network settings sub list etc etc. The control panel item, for example, spawns an alphabetical list of 50 items on my system that relate to system management. This is similar to the small icons view under Control Panel, but I can get to the list with one 'click' and it's nicely hidden away in a compact multi-use start button menu.<p>5) This is just purely convenience: the start button menu has direct access to power / reboot (switch user etc). With the new Win8 approach I can swipe the right side of the screen (annoying), then access ""Settings"" and then access power control (more steps, less options under one item, much slower). And obviously ctrl-alt-delete still gets you quick access to these options as well, but that's just another reason the swipe screens and start screen are pointless for me on the desktop.<p>6) I can customize the start button menu more than I can the start screen.<p>7) I work in the desktop mode, everything I use is in the desktop mode, it's ridiculous to boot me into the start screen to begin my experience.<p>The start screen doesn't even come close to how compact and fast the start button menu is. Not to mention the visual switching the start screen requires is a nasty work flow breaker because I have to dive into and out of a different interface, when I shouldn't have to do that just to access simple programs.",1355503691

I highly recommend it if you like games like spades/hearts/bridge.<p>If you have a regular gaming group, interesting meta-gaming manifests itself.

To fix this you must argue and explain with customer support that the account was hacked an that the 2 factor auth is preventing you from resetting passwords and such.<p>So, unless you turn on two factor auth up front for all users, it's going to actually make it worse for the end user if their account gets hacked.

(And as I type that, I wonder, maybe I'm saying more about myself than I am about sports . . )<p>I don't get it. If you grew up in Queens, you're a Mets fan. If you grew up in Philly, you're a Phillies fan. From my perspective, these people are exactly the same, except they are wearing different colors. Yet they are supposed to hate each other, and spend a large amount of time rationalizing their hate. There are hours upon hours of sports talk (gossip) radio on every day in every major city.<p>I've tried. There is a special place in my heart for the Baltimore Orioles. As a kid, I liked Cal Ripken because he had consistent stats (talk about nerdy), and later I lived in Baltimore. I'm trying to like the Brooklyn Nets, because their stadium is a few subway stops from me.<p>But I'm always on the metaphorical sidelines when it comes to fandom. The suspense can be fun, but at the end of the day, it's just a game to me.<p>One perfect example: A few years ago, the Philadelphia Eagles hired a quarterback who spent time in jail for abusing dogs (Michael Vick). Despite having grown up in Philadelphia, I immediately ceased rooting for that team. It was the easiest decision I ever made. Meanwhile, my Philadelphia friends agonized over this turn of events and eventually rationalized they could still root for the team, so long as Michael Vick made amends via charity/volunteering. The attachment is strong. I just don't get it.<p>Sports teams are the most powerful brands in the world. Maybe cigarette brands are a close second.",1355501721

And the tone you set for your community is vastly different.<p>Derision of stupidity is probably one of the worst characteristics of hacker culture, because stupidity tends to be shorthand for disagreement with my point of view.<p>I have trouble making a cogent argument around the derision of stupidity because derision should be self-evidently bad. It should automatically file under why would I want to do this to my own personality. Derision and bullying are <i>indistinguishable from each other</i>, and the thought that a group as oft-socially-maligned as hackers (at least until the last 6 years or so) defaults to derision seems more a sign of imitating things we were subjected to than reasoned thought.<p>If you go up to a group of people who are used to doing things according to procedure X and you blithely ignore it, you really should not be surprised when your efforts are met with derision at best and hostility at worst.<p>What does blithely ignore mean? Say this is the first open source project I've ever contributed to, so I don't know what the norms are in terms of where to even <i>look</i> for guidelines. Or I contributed 30 minutes of my time because that's all I had, and I devoted them to this. Or I'm learning to program, and I chose to try to help your project.<p>I will posit that anyone who is trying to contribute to your project is doing you a kindness. They may be doing it in a poor way, and you are within your rights to point that out. But <i>how</i> you point it out is what we're talking about. You an politely point out that the project doesn't accept pull requests. You can politely point out that tickets can't be opened until there's been a discussion on the mailing list. Etc. You can even be curt.<p>Derision is not curtness. It is not impatience. It is explicit, intentional putting-down of someone because they aren't as good at something as you are or think they should be. And it is a poison. Unfortunately, if you take it frequently enough, it becomes habit. It becomes second nature. And you stop noticing it's poisonous. And so, unfortunately, it is an oft-enjoyed poison in intellectual circles. It doesn't help anything. It doesn't help you understand the world or other people. It doesn't really save you that much time. It simply makes you feel better about yourself.",1355501541

That would have to place the person outside any possible ""envelope"" behind the material.<p>2) The material casts a dark shadow. If the material were really bending light around the concealed person, the area behind the blanket (with the exception of the envelope area) would be well lit by the light that was bent around the concealed area.<p>To understand what I mean by an ""envelope"", have a look at the last photo:<p><a href=""http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/HBC-Quantum-Stealth-sniper-cover-4c_small-225x300.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/HBC-Qu...</a><p>If you were looking from the top down, the envelope would (probably) be a (roughly) triangular prism shaped area in the middle of the blanket where the person is standing.

I would futz with it for several minutes exploring various ways of making it break, seeing if I could 1) predict how I was breaking it, and 2) use the error messages to fix my mistakes.<p>Then I would open up the book again and compare it to what I had typed, examine the differences between them, and see if/how they explained the errors I was getting.",1355500875

The marketing side of teams can be real progressive, we've built 4 SAAS apps that and have worked with over 150 teams around the country.<p>I'd say the best part is although they compete on the field, they don't consider each other competitors, so they exchange best practices constantly. Meaning if you do something good for one team it will get out quickly. We have hundreds of brand advocates in the space. Now when we launch a new product we can go from 0 to 40 sales and 1/2 mil rev in 6 months.<p>And as it pertains to the story. Only 30% of our staff is into sports and has a daily knowledge of players and league issues. In fact I don't follow any sport or watch ESPN, I just enjoy going to games in person. I think our companies objectiveness has helped is greatly.<p>Http://row27.com if you are curious.

Bezos and his family control 1/4 of the company directly, and a handful of institutions control another 1/2 of the company. Lack of oversupply of freely available shares at a high valuation, is one reason the stock defies gravity.<p>The other part of it is the narrative that Amazon sells.<p>But let's not pretend it has always defied gravity. Besides the obvious dotcom crash, their stock produced essentially a flat return from June 2000 until April 2007, with various ups and downs.",1355500853

She only revealed this after hearing people talk utter nonsense about my painting for five minutes. This is a classic post-modern taking-the-piss idea that has become part of art (where artists make things purely to mock the stupid ideas people have about 'what constitutes art'.) My painting was, as the article suggests, pretty rubbish.",1355500851

I just don't <i>care</i>. I care about politics, about music, about urban design, about architecture, about so many things that clearly have meaning and affect people's lives in real ways.<p>But when I watch two teams of people I don't personally know kick a ball around... I simply couldn't care less. Absolutely nothing whatsoever hinges on it. There's no meaning in it. And to this day, asking all my sports-obsessed friends why they like it so much, I've never gotten an answer I can actually understand or identify with. (The Onion T-shirt ""the sports team from my area is superior to the sports team from your area"" pretty much sums up the extent to which I understand it.)<p>And BTW, my code acts unpredictably often enough already, without my trying to make it so ;)",1355500841

This is why Go's semantics were chosen with speed-of-compilation in mind:<p>* Strictly acyclic module hierarchies (greatly simplifies compile-time name resolution)<p>* No generics (specialization has a compile-time cost)<p>* Unused imports are a fatal compilation error (to avoid having to parse unnecessary files)<p>All three of these decisions are somewhat contentious; Pike admits as much in many of his talks. But they were chosen because of the challenges of writing software at Google's scale. It is in this roundabout way that Go ""belongs"" to Google, in the sense that it addresses problems that Google has and prioritizes the best solutions to those problems, whether or not those solutions are at odds with the needs of non-Google users.",1355500822

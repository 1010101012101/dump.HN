I really wish people who argued against deflation would take the time to understand the underlying theories.<p><i>Deflation means, that the most fundamental law of finance is broken. The law, that says: It is much better to be given one dollar today, than to have one dollar next year.</i><p>Deflation does not break this law. It is always better to be given one bitcoin now than one bitcoin in the future - if you get it now you have the <i>option</i> of spending it, which has value. (If 1 BTC is worth 4 bags of pot today and 5 next year, 1 BTC in a year is worthless to me if I want to smoke now.)<p>He then argues that investment vehicles with a positive rate of return reduces consumption. This is true of both BTC and SPY. Unless bitcoin has the highest rate of return of all investment vehicles, the effect on consumption is irrelevant. I.e., if bitcoin has a return rate of 1% and SPY has a return rate of 2%, bitcoin will <i>not</i> affect the savings rate or reduce consumption [1].<p>If you are worried about people investing in bitcoin, consumption is irrelevant - the worry is that people will shift investments from SPY to BTC.<p>The fundamental problem with deflationary currencies is <i>nominal rigidity</i>. If you argue against deflation without mentioning this, you don&#x27;t know what you are talking about.<p><a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_rigidit"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_rigidity</a><p>tl;dr; Go learn Keynesian economics from a textbook that does math and carefully states assumptions. Don&#x27;t learn it from newspaper columns.<p>[1] I oversimplify slightly. Since SPY and BTC are likely to be minimally correlated with each other, you can construct portfolios of both securities which will likely have a higher risk-adjusted return SPY alone. So the portfolio rate of return might go up a few bps, and consumption will shift a little bit towards investment. This is a <i>small</i> effect.",1389444579

Rather than saying &quot;Well, you&#x27;re wrong because of X, Y, and Z&quot; you say &quot;you&#x27;re just white knighting&quot;, and suddenly there&#x27;s no need to list out any arguments.<p>Even beyond that, the entire logic framework behind the term is itself toxic; it&#x27;s rests on the unspoken assumption that arguments are only as valid as the intentions behind them.  I know nothing about the WMF&#x27;s HR policies, nor do I have an opinion on whether Stierch should or should not have been fired.  But if I say &quot;she should not have been fired because other employees in the same situation have not been in the past, and this creates a double standard&quot; (which as far as I know is not actually true; this is a hypothetical), it doesn&#x27;t matter if I&#x27;m saying it because I like Steich as a friend, or I want to sleep with her, or I behave like that towards all women, or I got into a fistfight with someone from the WMF in a bar once and have a grudge against the whole group; either my assertion is right or it&#x27;s wrong.  A facile accusation that I&#x27;m only saying that because I want to sleep with her (which is what the &quot;white knighting&quot; term means in this context) could be true, and it just wouldn&#x27;t matter.<p>In short, the term &quot;white knight&quot; is employed, almost without fail, in an attempt to bully and shut debate down; as the crudest of ad hominems.  And it needs to die.<p>(Edit:  For the record, I truly have no opinion on Stierch or the WMF in this case, and I haven&#x27;t even bothered to look at the comments being discussed.

7042448,comment,7042011,7042011,2,0,ACow_Adonis,,,"The short and easy answer is because wages/wealth has no necessary connection to how hard you work.<p>The tying of the notion of the cost of something to how much work goes into it is more or less the &quot;labour theory of value&quot;, a notion traditionally tied to Karl Marx (these days) and classical economics.  About the only place you&#x27;ll see it brought up these days is either with die-hard marxists, or, ironically, people trying to justify their wage/wealth.  The later do this because it seems almost ingrained in humans to assume that reward is tied to work somehow.  We hate shirkers.<p>Economists of course know this theory is bullshit, but it seems it won&#x27;t die, either from marxists, or as folk-economics among the general populace.<p>Wages are the cost to hire labour to someone with money.  In that case, how much they want something (their demand) depends upon, more or less, the marginal value of that good (or the thing derived from it in the case of labour) and how much money they&#x27;ve actually got to pay for it.  No money = no one really gives a hoot for your preferences/say.<p>On the side of labour, you&#x27;ve got few barriers to doing the job.  Just about everyone can labour in the fields, work on the industry line, sweep the hall.  There&#x27;s not much of a barrier to getting such a skill.  So supply is huge, and the relative productivity of most units are comparable to each other.  Most people clean, work the field, etc, at about the same rate as each other, so the output of individuals is quite comparable.<p>Put them together in the simplest cases and you&#x27;ve got your answer: the marginal value of the field worker/janitor/industrial worker is worth very little to the people with the money on the demand side, and on the supply side, practically everyone (including most of the third world) can basically do it.  And most of the third world are desperate to do it, so they&#x27;ll bargain down quite low.<p>In a trivial sense, the case of programmers, and then above them, CEO&#x27;s can be explained in this way as well.  Programmers can do things that are relatively valuable to the people with the money.  Not everyone can be a programmer.  Its actually quite expensive to make a programmer.  If you stop paying a certain amount, programmers will just go off and do something else.<p>In a more complex sense however, things get a bit more hairy. What is it that people with money value? Are they always correct? Why do they value those things? What about in jobs/positions where output/input is impossible to measure?  Are they really so rational?  Are those without money really powerless?  What role do courts/police/judges/democracy/military play in all this?<p>The earlier provides an understanding of the basic economics.  The later questions bring you closer to the truth, but I could barely touch upon them and do them justice in a HN post.",1389444093

221728,comment,221715,221715,0,0,jraines,,,"Yeah, my dad, a family practice physician for 20 years, would confirm this.  His monthly overhead costs (in a tightly run physicians' group) are mind blowing and he has working hours and a sleep schedule that would stupify this 25 year old.  He could work a quarter of the hours and make more money just doing ER work, but feels an obligation to his patient base.  But there are many other doctors making that choice or choosing lucrative niche specialties, and who can blame them?  There's almost no economic and lifestyle incentive to become a general practitioner anymore.<p>Also, any time you have a complicated system that no one believes in, people are going to try to game it.  So you have some doctors billing Medicare these huge sums for a patient coming in with a runny nose, and this further discourages the honest doctors.",1213879056

221722,comment,220827,221667,0,0,gaius,,,"Well, that's not quite true. If interest rates change only rarely, then you can plan. ""If I save I will get this much interest"", ""if I get a mortgage, it will cost this much"" and so on. There's value in that predictability. Once you take that away you force people to hedge their bets against uncertaintly and that increases the cost of every transaction. This manifests itself as ""economic slowdown"", e.g. ""I won't do this thing I planned, because I need to put some aside in case my costs go up"".",1213878205

I have had success with them overall.<p>I switched to Yahoo as my host from an inexpensive provider because of a bad experience I had with shared hosting.  I was apparently sharing a server with a very bad spammer, and got my email blocked by <i>Comcast</i>. Not a small part of the market (and owner of my personal email, for that matter).<p>When I called for help, other provider said they're talking to Comcast but being more or less ignored, and that it was ultimately my problem to get Comcast to let my mail pass.<p>Uh, no.<p>Now, if that happens again I have the power of Yahoo to put pressure on Comcast (or whatever) to let my mail pass.<p>As for a host, I'm disappointed by the lack of tools (latest php, latest mySQL, python, etc), available.<p>But I've been a desktop app guy, so it hasn't hit me yet.

221713,comment,221097,221433,0,0,richhickey,,,"> Clojure objects are Java Objects, so they must be boxed & unboxed by the JVM.<p>I presume you meant Clojure numbers, because there is no notion of 'boxing' for reference types. For all non-numeric objects, the Clojure representation is the same as the Java representation. Type-hinted calls to methods of said objects generate the same bytecode as Java, with the same performance.<p>As far as numbers, recent enhancements ( <a href=""http://clojure.org/java_interop#primitives"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clojure.org/java_interop#primitives</a> ) allow Clojure to produce primitive arithmetic with the same speed as Java, but with a more-powerful, macro-amenable syntax.<p>While Clojure offers higher-order constructs with an attendant, but not prohibitive, cost, performance-oriented Clojure code can match the speed of Java.",1213877444

They're replacing food with food-like substances that benefit the senses (the taste, eyes--colorful packaging, ears--jingles in commercials) but serve little purpose to your body, if any, as it actually enters your stomach.  In exception, of course, are yearly checkups and prevention, but in those cases, one can think they're simply getting back a portion of their premiums.",1213877101

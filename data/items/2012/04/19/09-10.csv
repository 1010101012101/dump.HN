3862175,comment,3861860,3862072,3,0,dspig,,,"There are three separate things going on here:  The standard ""6 dB per bit"" is the approximate signal-to-noise ratio with a flat dither.  Then you can use a shaped dither to increase the dynamic range at some frequencies at the expense of others (the SNR actually decreases as the dither is louder overall, but quieter at frequencies the ear is most sensitive).  Then in a real-world DAC there is analog noise getting in at various points in the circuit, so that is what limits the end result to 111 dB.<p>So yes, the main reason to use a 24-bit DAC here is for volume adjustment, so the lowest bits are well below the analog noise floor, not above it like they would be for a 16-bit DAC.",1334829507

3862158,comment,3861621,3861621,15,0,pud,,,"Thanks for posting these ideas.  Here are some thoughts off the top of my head, train-of-thought.<p>Band Generator - There's something I love about this.  I don't think Fandalism can just ""generate"" a band any more than LinkedIn can ""generate"" a startup.  That said, it seems like musicians are always looking for the equivalent of marriage (a band) when I think it might be more fun to just have a several one-off trysts (random jams).  The latter isn't really something musicians do currently.  Which is an obstacle. But maybe there's a way to spark this behavior using a ""random person to jam with this wednesday"" generator.<p>Worldwide Music Battles - In theory this sounds really fun.  I recently did a contest with Interscope records to promote the new Van Halen album.  Musicians performed cover versions of the new Van Halen single in exchange for the possibility of fame and fortune. There weren't as many entries as I was hoping for.  I think it comes down to musicians as artists -- and artists want to be free to create.  They don't want to be told what to play. I think. Or maybe they think contests are cheesy, and your idea is more legit. I'll experiment.<p>Collaborative Online Recording - I think indabamusic.com does this.  At least, that's the impression I get (I haven't used that site yet). It's surprisingly non-trivial to just throw a drumset recording over your bass line.  To get a good drum sound you need a few mics, a mixer, recording software, EQ & mixing skills... it's really easier (and more fun, for me at least) to just jam with people in real life. And record it.<p>Thanks again for these ideas.  They got me thinking and I'm sure I'll use them in some regard as I build new features.  Same goes with all the awesome comments in my original post.<p>I'll keep blogging as I add new stuff to Fandalism.  I plan to add a lot of stuff that was suggested in HN, in one way or another.",1334829106

Instead, when I dream or code (I am learning to code, I am a finance guy), I am making demos for things that should provide a better way to explore your data: <a href=""http://andemo.ep.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://andemo.ep.io/</a>.<p>Basically, my issue with corporate analytics is that there are no apis. Everything has to be accessed from its software. SAP data stays in SAP or goes in some 90' data warehause system.<p>Another issue is that data is stored in multiple versions in different files across many users locations (Excel files madness). This drives people nuts and I can't understand why don't we already have a BaseCamp for finance and analytics.<p>A third issue is that people are mixing data and views. This makes usually data in, i.e. in spreadsheets, completelly unuseful for other analysis, you basically have to copy and paste data from the fancy templates to a clean file to use it. Views should be web based too, not to enter the 'update this file periodically manually' hell.<p>Once you have apis, it's a matter of building apps to consume them and eventually to make snapshots of your data (you don't want to recalculate monthly billings at every page request). Your specific need, for example, could be solved with a fancy web based pivot table (the sort you have in spreadsheets) that accesses json data...<p>So, finally, if you find or start an interesing project of this type, let me know as I am interested to join!",1334829078

Yet during booms the money saved is too little and during recessions the money spent is too much.</i><p>Too little or too much with respect to what?<p><i>you (...) pay down your debt by (...) printing money</i><p>There is a misunderstanding underlying this sentence which probably explains most of the hyperinflation-phobia that is going on. The truth of the matter is this: both physical money and treasuries (government debt) are liabilities of the government. There are only two differences between them: (a) coupon (interest payment) and (b) maturity.<p>Paying back the debt by ""printing money"" is just exchanging one maturity for a different one. There is nothing inflationary or defaulting about that. Heck, the US government could just stop issuing bonds with long maturities altogether and it wouldn't change a thing (except for altering the maturity/interest structure of the financial assets held by the private sector). All this debt you're seeing is money that <i>has already been spent</i>.<p><i>But remember, the purpose of Keynesian approach was to smooth out booms and busts in the economy, yet what we're seeing is making them lasting longer and falling harder.</i><p>This may be your personal impression, but if you look objectively at the actual data, you'll see that it is incorrect.

I have primarily been involved in building tools to make this kind of analysis easier - but it is very difficult.<p>As you mention, the primary issue is that almost all business data is <i>very</i> complex.  There are very few areas (in my experience), where simple queries offer much value, because there are so many niggling business rules that lead to exceptions and counter exceptions to rules.<p>This means that ""self service"" analytics are pretty much impossible.  There are often very few people in an organization who actually know how to define even seemingly simple measures like profit or revenue.<p>This means you need consultants who can learn the business rules, and who also understand the data platform.  This makes these projects expensive, and makes it hard for platforms to win in the market.<p>For the most part in my experience, the best way forward is to choose a database engine (MySQL, Postgress, Oracle, DB2, SQL Server), get the data into it (itself difficult!), then write a bunch of SQL to incorporate the business rules.  Then if you are feeling fancy (and still have budget!), built a nice HTML front end on it.<p>Its not very sexy, but it does work.

I went and found some users first. Then I observed what they did and what they valued. Then I changed my idea. Then I went and observed some more. Then I changed my idea again. Then I went and talked about the idea to a group of folk that I was 90% certain that I was solving a problem for - and they mostly liked it. Tweaked the idea a bit. Went back. They loved it. They told their friends. And they pre-registered. Based on word of mouth.<p>Now I've got to the point where I can build something.<p>I <i>know</i> I have probably a couple of hundred users who are keen on the product. I know that they're keen enough about the idea to recommend it to friends. I'm not entirely sure whether they'll be entirely profitable or not - not sure yet. The only way to find that out is to build something (or the quickest and cheapest way anyway).<p>The point I'm trying to drive home is that having a way of getting to users is a core part of your business. It's not something that you should wait to figure out until after you've built your product (because figuring it out may well affect the way you build you product).<p><i>What would you recommend in my shoes?</i><p>Find a group of users of your product that you can contact directly.<p>In real life - face to face.<p>Preferably find a sub-group of your market that is most passionate about whatever problem it is that you're solving. The ones with the most pain, or the ones with the most to gain.<p>Talk to them one-on-one, encourage them to use your product. Watch what they do. Where possible tweak the product to support that group in a total wonderful way.<p>Encourage testimonials and references (any forms of social proof that you can use before you get large numbers).<p>Encourage the people <i>using</i> your product to invite other people who will <i>use</i> the product. Look at the way FreeAgent and Rackspace referrals work for example.<p>Be prepared to put a lot of effort in.<p>In my experience getting actual real users is a long, hard slog that takes time and effort to pull off. Unfortunately I think you're actually at a disadvantage now by having a fully formed product without users - because you may find that the ""generic"" product that you have now is harder to pitch to the smaller market that might have pulled in your initial early adopters.",1334827997

He talks about guilt-free volume adjustment.  That is, if you lower the volume in software, you're effectively decreasing your dynamic range because you're artificially limiting the range of values you can use.  Makes sense.  Is that the main reason you'd want to use a 24-bit DAC here?  (Of course, this assumes you have 24-bit source material as well.)<p>Just really curious about this...

In addition to existing resources, OCW, books, etc...<p>There doesn't seem to be an equivalent for EE or Hardware related learning aside from going to school, hitting the books, etc... Please don't say ""just dive right in"". I whole-heartedly agree that the best way to learn is hands on but it would be nice to be able to have a solid format to go off of.<p>Background: I'm completely self taught. My entire background is completely on the programming side. I have pretty much little to no knowledge of where to even begin getting involved in hardware and all the resources I've looked into online are extremely vague and does not do a solid job breaking down things the way they do for programming and all the various things you need. For example, if you want to do web development, you'll need HTML, CSS, and Javascript on the front end (probably best in that order although not required), a choice of a backend language, etc... For hardware, there is a lot more working knowledge and I assume they build off each other, and its really hard to get any solid advice or a list of things in the order you need to learn them (short of going off some course cirriculum.<p>I get that there are things like the arduino and stuff out there and I've looked into it. But it doesn't really make the learning curve any easier to understand, or rather, what the heck am I suppose to learn in the first place. About the only thing I'm sure of right now is learning to solder and apparently starting with signals and counters. Can anyone break this down a bit better for me or provide better list of things I need to know, the order in which I need to learn them if there is knowledge that builds on top of another, etc...<p>I don't mind diving into books and doing whatever, I just need a general guideline if you will. Thanks.",1334826528

The tools, and even the underlying theory is stuck in the past, and every project I work on is hampered by the technology not meeting the expectations of (business) users who demand a much more intuitive way of working - because that's what the experience every day on consumer devices.<p>There are issues though with getting consistent and accurate measures that are not easily solved by just looking at the data - albeit at a very high level of detail) for example when customers move or change details, it's easy to lose track of where you should be reporting the facts. And depending on the volume of data it's not going to be a long term solution to recalculate <i>everything</i> every day - which is the mistake a lot of companies make when trying to cope with this.<p>The problem is in your question. The Cube. This is a construct that assumes that the underlying data is typed allowing it to be re-arranged into facts, characteristics and attributes, and unless you have the foresight to think of your db like this before you build your web app, it's hard going to squeeze it into the dimensional model.<p>In fact I'd go as far as saying that the dimensional model is no longer a suitable model for dealing with event based data generation, and that may be why you ask the question.<p>It's one of my personal goals to solve this, I have some thoughts but it's not quite my priority at the moment, but I'd love to hear what others have to say on this.",1334826217

The last changelog entry on 2011/12/06 says nothing about ruby or rails versions.

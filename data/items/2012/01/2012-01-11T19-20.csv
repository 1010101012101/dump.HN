Since anything and everything that is digital <i>can</i> be pirated, if you are trying to make a living only selling digital goods to the masses, it makes it a lot tougher.<p>The commenter below mentioned developers who put apps out in the app store, and that it would be hard to make a living doing that. That's for sure, it would be. That's why you put out an app in the app store as a side project, and use the leverage that it's popularity gives you to get a more high paying job making custom apps for companies who can't just buy the exact software they need off the app store.<p>If you are a professional photographer, I would assume that you get paid to do ""gigs"" - a photo shoot for a magazine, photos for a band's album cover, whatever. The magazine needs an expert to do this custom job <i>just for them</i> - they can't buy what they need for their fashion spread off a stock images store.<p>That's why making a living only off stock photos is tough. That's why making a living only off app store apps is tough. That's why making a living only off selling stuff in the envato marketplace is tough. And there are only a few of the absolute best and most popular people on these sites that actually do.<p>That doesn't mean if you're not one of the people doing this that you're not talented. That means you have to realize that putting out works, creative or not, into stock marketplaces or elsewhere in the open that many people could have a use for means that you should stop fighting it and just allow the many people to use them. It will be a good thing on the side, and boost your popularity, whether or not you could potentially be losing a bit of money, technically, by doing this.<p>If you need to make money, you should find a market where you are producing custom work for people who need it at a professional level. I write code for a living, and I try to make open source stuff as much as I can. I love the thought of people finding my stuff useful, and I code it for the love. But I also have enough money to pay the rent and for food because my main job does not involve writing general purpose code for the public, it involves writing very tailored code for one company at a time.",1326311875

I write on my blog and I just got a couple of pieces published in the Atlantic Tech blog. I don't get paid for any of that writing. If I tried to charge for it, no one would pay me. So I give it away for free while I hone my skills and build my (freely available) ouevre, in the hope that eventually the quality of my work will be such that I will be able to fund the production of the work, not the distribution of copies. (I.e. in the hope that I'll get hired by a web site or magazine to write on staff full-time.) So my money is actually located exactly where my mouth is.<p>Who's to say he hasn't already paid his dues? Maybe he did do sample work when he was just starting out and he's now at the phase where he's monetizing his skill set by selling good photos. He doesn't have a problem with companies that don't want to pay, he just says that what he does isn't cheap or free to do so pay him some money for his time and effort or just don't use the picture. If some website asks you to write full-time but they can't pay you anything other than exposure, are you going to take it? No, because you have a valuable skill that should be paid.<p>But let's try to keep it in the context of the post. He has a picture, apparently companies _want_ this picture so he has something that they cannot get just by grabbing an amateur's version of the photograph. These companies also have large ad and marketing budgets so money shouldn't be an issue yet somehow it is. I think in this case he has a right to be mad. He can't work for free, and since he took it and owns the rights to it he should be able to tell those companies to piss off. If there is a demand for his photo to be used then he should get paid.",1326311535

3453341,comment,3452519,3452519,2,0,gringomorcego,,,"lolololololol<p>To me, the articles main support for the rise of Intel as a mobile chip competitor are:
1). Motorola made a deal
2). Intel can leverage their own manufacturing process/plants<p>The first is stupid. Considering how much Motorola bent over for Microsoft, this is probably more Microsoft doing Intel a solid to get into the market rather than a purely ""logical"" financial long-term decision by Motorola.<p>The second I can't really argue about with any real knowledge. However, upgrading plants is fucking expensive. By ARM separating themselves from that portion of the chip business, they have basically enabled a secondary competitive market of improving ARM designs. Intel has locked themselves into the position of Overseer of all-best-designs, and whether or not this is true, it will lead to comparative stagnation in innovation.<p>I'm might be wrong, but I honestly think that Intel will lose simply because their mentality depends too much on an idea of limited competition. They are too used to AMD and legacy slaves; the switch to open-source and web-based systems will lead to insane competition and crunch their profit margins like a nutcracker.",1326311506

I find that a lot of the time I'm told about how people with qualities distinct from mine should be cut some slack or given extra incentives to get into industry to correct some sort of imbalance, and that the imbalance is somehow evidence of barriers that we can't see, and that incentivising these groups (and in effect putting barriers up against people like me) is the way forward.<p>To me, discrimination is discrimination, regardless. I don't take issue with any qualities of anyone - the right person for the job is the right person for the job. Perhaps historically barriers meant that the right person for the job was a white male (bearing in mind societal pressures, the availability of education and options etc.) and the prevalence of white males is a hangover, if so like all hangovers it will die down.<p>What I do know is that in my profession (technical infosec) there's a hard time finding talent, but that's because your average graduate student won't cut it.

In the world of easy digital duplication, we are fast approaching the inability to produce creative works except with the support of patrons. I worry that this leaves creativity at a social disadvantage to physical commodities, selling Coke or furniture or razors or stocks, which are jobs that provide a steady salary that help people live.

For example, any program that stores text in UCS-4: an array of 32-bit values, each holding a single code point.<p>This is how way too many people think that UTF-16 works: each code point gets 16 bits, and you have an array of them, so you can count characters, do O(1) random indexing, and so on. This is a harmful myth, of course. Code points do not correspond neatly to glyphs, and UTF-16 is a variable-width encoding, although most people don't use code points outside the basic multilingual plane, so a lot of people can get away with pretending that it's fixed-width, until they can't.<p>The most maddening instance of this confusion that I've seen so far is in Python's Unicode string handling. Guess what happens when you run this Python code to find the length of a string containing a single Unicode code-point:<p><pre><code>    print len(u""\U0001d11e"")
</code></pre>
This will print either 1 or 2, depending on what flags the Python interpreter was compiled with! If it was compiled one way (the default on Mac OS X), then it uses an internal string representation that it sometimes treats as UTF-16 and sometimes as UCS-2. With another set of flags (default on Ubuntu, IIRC) it will use UCS-4 and do the Right Thing. For the same task, Java gets the string length right, but requires you to explicitly write the string as a UTF-16 surrogate pair: ""\uD834\uDD1E"".<p>The redeeming virtue that both share is that they will do the right thing if you treat everything as variable-width encoded, use the provided methods for encoding and decoding, and avoid the hairy parts left over from when people naively assumed that UTF-16 and UCS-2 were the same thing and that they ought to be enough for anybody.",1326309986

After almost five years of talking about getting into mobile phone form factors, Intel went out and built a reference platform that proved what they've been saying was possible all along. Furthermore, Intel also finally landed a couple of partners who are willing to show their support by incorporating Medfield into their product portfolio. The releases are still a few months away at the earliest (possibly even longer for Motorola) but it's much better news than Intel has ever reported before in this space.<p>The partnerships aren't out of pity either: Medfield is fast. I firmly believe had it been released a year ago it would have dominated the Android smartphone market from the very start. Even today it appears to deliver better CPU performance than anything on the market, despite only having a single core. GPU performance is still not as fast as what's in the A5 but it's competitive with much of the competition today, and I fully expect the dual-core version of Medfield to rectify this problem.<p>Based on the data Intel shared with us as well, the x86 power problem appears to be a myth - at least when it comes to Medfield. I'm still not fully convinced until we're able to test a Medfield based phone ourselves, but power efficiency at the chip level doesn't seem to be a problem.<p>Medfield and the Atom Z2460 are a solid starting point. Intel finally has a chip that they can deliver to the market and partners to carry it in. Intel also built a very impressive reference platform that could lead to some very interesting disruptions in the market.<p>While I'd like to say that Intel's Medfield team can now breathe a sigh of relief, their work is far from over - especially with more competitive ARM based SoCs showing up later this year.

3453160,comment,3452519,3452839,5,0,rsynnott,,,"That was rather different, as Apple was entirely dependent on IBM and Motorola to produce new chip designs (and Motorola had effectively quit the desktop market). The G5 was actually reasonably competitive with the P4 at the time the move was made, and beat it on some SIMD work. The real trouble was that IBM had repeatedly slipped on its deadlines to produce a low-power laptop-appropriate G5, and the aging G4 architecture just wasn't good enough.<p>Today, the story is very different. Apple can produce its own SoC designs, as with the A5, or even produce its own ARM _core_ designs, like Qualcomm does, or it can buy from one of a number of healthy vendors who show no signs of quitting ARM anytime soon. If this Intel core had a genuine dramatic performance advantage over the A15 (which it will be competing with, given the timescales), at the same power usage, that would be one thing, but that's far from clear right now.",1326309170

The simple fact that they cannot be bothered to upgrade their devices after it leaves the sales center is driving a lot of customers into other vendors arms after a single Samsung purchase. Just ask any early adopted of their tables who have not seen a single upgrade.

There is a lot I like about Android as an OS but as far as Samsung and Android the lifetime of the device support lasts only until the sale is made and it is not a winning strategy for even acceptable software. They have to address this huge issue if they want to maintain customers after their first Samsung device purchase.<p><i>theyll be happy to plop down a few hundred for a TV that can evolve every year with the addition of an upgrade package that ups the processing power and adds features.</i><p>They will have to adopt a different strategy than their phone strategy if that is the case.

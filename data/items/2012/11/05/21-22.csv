As you become an increasingly skilled developer you realized that you gain order of magnitude more productivity by working at increasingly higher levels of automation and abstraction.  This can be very difficult with a graphical interface since it would likely take much more work to create an adapter which will allow your code to work with the GUI interface than a command line one.

AMD hasn't actually done very well in the mobile space historically, when they could have produced low-power Ultrabook-like designs. Hell, they could've made something like the new Chromebook and had no fans. Either there's a severe lack of vision, or this is actually much more difficult to implement with the x86 instruction set than you're lettingon.<p>> But people use it as a proxy for performance, so the ads keep including it.<p>People generally don't care about clock speeds at this point, and I don't know if they ever really did. I worked retail about 6 years ago, and customers had no clue about clock speeds. Frankly, they were mostly worried about hard drives and screen size.<p>> No one wants to convince retailer marketers that a system clocked at half the speed of their competitors is actually just as fast.<p>Retail is the tip of the iceberg. HPC is a big market, commodity servers are a huge market. Halving your power consumption in those areas would be massive, and would give AMD a real cash injection. But there's no silver bullet there. You may be slightly right, but you're massively overstating the benefits compared to the costs of implementing it.",1352149720

You can always donate to Party A closer to the election if you want to even things out, but donating between cycles is a very powerful way of sending a message. Alternatively, support a primary challenger. Money talks. Is this institutionalized corruption?

He opposed it for all the right reasons and the response demonstrated that he'd actually taken time to understand the issues with the bill.<p>Excerpted:<p>>On October 26, 2011, Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) introduced H.R. 3261, the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA).  According to its sponsor, this legislation seeks to ""promote prosperity, creativity, entrepreneurship, and innovation by combating the theft of U.S. property, and for other purposes.""  However, this bill, and its Senate companion bill, S. 968 (the Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property (PROTECT IP) Act), would also give the U.S. Attorney General (USAG) authority to seek an injunction from a federal court against domain names used by foreign websites that actively promote or distribute counterfeit goods, as well as permitting content owners to sue the intermediate service providers that support websites hosting pirated content.<p>>Both of these bills would give the USAG unprecedented authority to seek out court orders against foreign internet sites that have been accused of copyright infringement. This includes websites that host user-submitted content, such as the popular websites Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. These and any other websites that allow comments would now be responsible for screening any and all user activity for potential infringement. This discourages innovation in the world's most fluid industry, and the United States' economic strength is dependent on its citizen's ability to create, innovate and become entrepreneurs in various industries.<p>>In addition to the costs of content screening, online search engines will be forced to remove the accused website from displayed search results, online advertising companies will be forced to break contracts with accused hosts, and online payment processors will be forbidden from engaging in any further transactions with the accused host. This is all carried out without any of the due process offered in present copyright infringement cases.<p>>The legislation is intended to protect the consumer from fraudulent medicine, counterfeited goods, and pirated data (music, photos, movies), but is too broadly written without regard for the unintended consequences. Both of these bills stand in direct conflict with established U.S. policy of internet openness and will have little impact on actual criminal online piracy, which is the target of both pieces of legislation.<p>I really could not have asked for a better reply to my letter, nor did I really expect one anywhere near this good. It earned Rep. Westmoreland serious brownie points in my book.<p>The problem is that I disagree with him on nearly <i>everything</i> else. He was right this time, but was wrong on e.g. mandatory arbitration as a condition of employment for federal contractors in the wake of the KBR rape scandal.<p>The suggestion that I should vote for him on the basis of his SOPA position alone is missing the forest for the trees.",1352149502

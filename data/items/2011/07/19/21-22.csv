This paragraph was particularly illuminating:<p><i>Social networks are a critical layer of infrastructure for a wide variety of applications and content. Unlike physical networks, opportunities for lock-in emerge not at the physical layer but at the social layer: our connections. In other words, they do not wield monopoly control by dint of massive up-front fixed costs but rather by the accumulated value contributed by users in the form of the social graph!</i><p>However, to play the Devil's advocate, I am not entirely convinced that unlike electricity, or water, why these services are considered essential, considering how recently the entire concept of a social graph emerged. I see a strong case for enforcing neutrality rules for the internet, partly because a lot of the costs were initially bore by taxpayer money, but the same can't be said of Facebook and Twitter.",1311112685

Crazy anecdote huh!<p>The article also points out that shockingly just because something is natural it's not necessarily safe. Which is both true and obvious but no less FUD.<p><i>Myth #2: Organic Foods are Healthier</i><p>This is highly contested. Study after study, keep finding conflicting results. There are very strong indications some high yield variates have more calories or water, but less of everything else. But that's the varieties, not how they are grown. Overall this is anything but clear cut at this point.<p><i>But when researchers had people put their mouths to the test, they found that people couldn’t tell the difference between the two in blind taste tests.</i><p>I hate to also bring anecdotes to this anecdote filled articles, but I can instantly taste the difference between an organic banana and a conventional one. I don't need to know which one it is. I've blindly picked up and bought bananas and every time if it's just not as good, I check and it turns out to be conventionally grown. This could be due to them being different varieties, maybe longer time on the vine, maybe farm size affect flavor, or maybe my bias is so powerful it's completely skewing how I experience the world!<p><i>Organic Farming Is Better For The Environment</i><p><i>The simple fact is that they’re not – at least the issue is not that cut and dry.</i><p>Ah yes, it is not that cut and dry, but the first part that sentence claims exactly that.<p><i>GMOs have the potential to up crop yields, increase nutritious value, and generally improve farming practices while reducing synthetic chemical use</i><p>That's a lot of potential, but we've seen little of it come to pass yet. Specifically it turns out its more profitable to make crops pesticide immune/resistant and then use MORE pesticides to help the crop out-compete weeds.<p>Theoretical genetic engineering sounds fantastic, the actual GM we currently have is rather practical and not at all that great. That doesn't mean GM isn't good, it just means that conventional GM mass produced commercial crops today are not particularly good.<p><i>Yet organic proponents refuse to even give GMOs a chance, even to the point of hypocrisy. For example, organic farmers apply Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxin (a small insecticidal protein from soil bacteria) unabashedly across their crops every year, as they have for decades. It’s one of the most widely used organic pesticides by organic farmers. Yet when genetic engineering is used to place the gene encoding the Bt toxin into a plant’s genome, the resulting GM plants are vilified by the very people willing to liberally spray the exact same toxin that the gene encodes for over the exact same species of plant.</i><p>Apples and Oranges. The Bt toxin and bacteria sprayed on the plants can be easily washed off. The toxin inside very single cell of the plant you're eating - kind of a different animal. Probably still safe, but to shout hypocrisy is FUD.<p><i>But the real reason organic farming isn’t more green than conventional is that while it might be better for local environments on the small scale, organic farms produce far less food per unit land than conventional ones. Organic farms produce around 80% that what the same size conventional farm produces16 (some studies place organic yields below 50% those of conventional farms!).</i><p>Ah, but other studies have shown organic farms can out produce conventional farms. Again, anything but cut and dry. One thing that is pretty clear is that human labor can have a HUGE impact on yields. Add a lot more labor and you get A LOT more. Obviously manual labor is very expensive. (Yes, even at migrant workers wages, it is very expensive in terms of what fruits and vegetables cost).<p><i>Myth #4: It’s all or none</i><p><i>The point of this piece isn’t to vilify organic farming; it’s merely to point out that it’s not as black and white as it looks.</i><p>I could have sworn the point was to spread FUD: ""Scientific American says Organic food no better than conventional!""",1311110967

Typically rising revenue/employee and net-income/per-customer are good indications of 'boom'. A Bubble is often characterized by an increase in value without significant change in the fundamentals of a company (either revenue/employee or income/customer). The latter is speculation that in the future the company will be worth more than it is now, the latter reflects that the company is <i>actually</i> worth more now than it was before.<p>Loved the graphic too, it was a good characterization. I think there is a tremendous amount of trepidation about the possibility of being 'caught' in another bubble.

I guarantee that the number of people who use those features is much larger than the number of people who read the source before today.<p>The UNIX style promoted in the ""cat -v Considered Harmful"" paper may have made sense at one time, but it doesn't make sense anymore.  For example:<p><i>It seems that UNIX has become the victim of cancerous growth at the hands of\norganizations such as UCB. 4.2BSD is an order of magnitude larger than Version\n5, but, Pike claims, not ten times better.</i><p>This logic gives the same consideration to people who are digging in the source code for these utilities as to people who actually use them.  When you consider the relative numbers, that's a very elitist attitude (for some value of ""elite"").<p>Also consider the explanation given in another comment for why ""cat -n"" is unnecessary:<p><i>If you want to number a file's lines, 'echo ,n | ed file | sed 1d' or 'awk ''{ print NR "" "" $0 }''' will do just fine.</i><p>Munging text like that is a pretty common skill for Unix users, but by no means universal.

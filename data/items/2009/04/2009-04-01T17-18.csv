We can't decide what to license it under. GPLv2? GPLv3? Affero GPL? MIT??<p>My initial reaction was to license under 'GPLv2 and up'... I have some qualms with v3 but I don't want to limit anybody's use based on that.

Everything from the poorly worded ""box"" to the competitor's ads to the clipped logos and trademarks seems designed to stick it to the companies in question in a manner that is borderline extortion.<p>It seems that instead of seeing companies as clients and selling them a service they can use, they're operating a giant defamation board where anything goes, and perpetrating the ""us against them"" mentality that seems popular these days with consumers.<p>Bad karma begets bad karma, and the whole business case of GS seems to be designed to generate bad karma.

542145,comment,541753,541893,0,0,crpatino,,,"Why would you consider unfair to call logic thinking as mathematical thinking? Maybe it is the engineering background indeed, at least it is for myself. Maybe it was all those ""engineering math"" mandatory courses... you know, calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, statistics. If we keep thinking about math in terms of some sort of computation which ought to result in a numeric answer... then, absolutely, I agree that has nothing to do with logic.<p>However, least see what happens when one does not apply mathematical thinking into his own reasoning. I do it myself from time to time and refer to it as my ""rat intelligence"". You go over and over the facts, one at a time, trying to figure out the way out... It feels pretty much like a rat walking through a maze inside of my brain.<p>But it comes to a point, when the problem is very hard, that no matter how many times the rat goes over and over the same data, it does not find the answer. In that case you need a superior type of reasoning. You need to step aside and look at the problem as a whole. To find patterns that you can abstract out and rephrase the problem in a way more tractable. And I think in this broader sense logic and math use the same type of mental tools (principles) to attack the same issues.",1238607056

But in the case of a new contract, that highballing will set the course for the following deals.  You get more at the start, and the following deals will all follow a similar price-point.<p>Furthermore, by demanding high at the beginning, and then coming down, the person with whom you're negotiating will feel as though he/she ""won"" the negotiation, due to the huge concessions you made ""He was asking a million dollars for a plan and we got him for $250k.""<p>My point is you can highball and still have a solid post-negotiation business relationship.<p>I will definitely be checking out your book recommendations though.",1238606828

A better question to me would be ""Why do they make Safari for Windows?"". I'm not sure... is it to show different Apple software to Windows users and lure them into buying Macs? That sounds doubtful to me but I might be wrong.<p>But my question was a serious question: what do you think Apple has to gain from getting the Cocoa/Obj-C developers to write web-apps in Obj-J?",1238605423

Unfortunately, a lot of people view college as a 4-year job-preparation institution instead of an institute of higher learning.<p>Then again, you could view the fact that more and more people are starting their own businesses as a potential solution.  We're realizing that you don't need to wait to get ""experience"" or education, so if you can move faster than a traditional job or college, why not do so?",1238605350

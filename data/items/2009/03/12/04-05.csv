My suggestion is to download the SDK first, play with it, and if you get a good start on an app then pay the $100.""<p>(2)\n""I have 41 cheap and simple (but useful) apps on the App Store right now and have been growing my catalog since late July. Each app took me less than a day to do. Some days I've cranked out five apps (and no, they are not the stupid ""Countdown till Easter, Countdown till Christmas"" apps). I easily have pulled $10k/month for the last 6 months in a row, quit my day job, and now do iPhone stuff full time. I have no employees, no costs (besides tax), minimal no-cost marketing, and no time schedule. I work MAYBE five to ten hours per week on this stuff.""<p><a href=""http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=621564&page=3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=621564&page...</a><p>The reality of the iPhone app store is sobering. If you build something average or maybe a little above average, they will not come in droves. I believe if you build something truly kick-ass and inform the right influencers - word of mouth via Twitter will get you on TechCrunch and its ilk in 24 hours or less.<p>I also believe, however, that there will always be a small market for iPhone apps that are relatively novel and/or useful on a daily basis (useful: Tweetie is the best paid Twitter client in my opinion - integrated Summize search).<p>For example of something that is novel, iPhone Pano (guides you through taking six photos and stitches them into a fairly impressive panoramic photo - you used to need Photoshop/Gimp to manually stitch them together). I use it quite a lot. It cost $2.99 and I think I've gotten way more out of it (friends wondering what the heck I was doing with the iPhone and being wow'd by the resulting picture that I emailed once I sync'd with my MacBook).<p>Should I quit with learning iPhone SDK since the market is so competitive? I've rationalized to continue the learning curve (more off than on though) because I want to write some apps that I would personally use. I will probably get the $99/yr license just to deploy my own apps once I make it up the learning curve. It's not about an embarrassment of iPhone app riches - it's about an interesting new hobby - one that your non-geek friends (who likely have an iPhone) might appreciate eventually.",1236832724

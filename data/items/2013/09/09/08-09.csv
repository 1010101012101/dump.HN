They are more shock resistant, but I&#x27;ve got north of a decade watching how hard drives fail.  I&#x27;ve got a reasonable feel for it.   SSDs?  I am less familiar with.  They /do/ fail just like any other drive;  not only after you&#x27;ve written them X times.  (I mean, they have that problem, too... but this idea that a ssd is more reliable because it&#x27;s got no moving parts is bunk.  You still need your raid.)<p>The problem I see is twofold.<p>1. if I&#x27;m buying thousands of hard drives, I can probably get &#x27;em cheaper than you can.<p>and<p>2. if we&#x27;re talking any hard drive you have laying about, (in which case, yeah, it might be &#x27;cheaper&#x27; in that you don&#x27;t want the hard drive anymore, and the effort of selling it is a large portion of it&#x27;s value)    well, then you have the problem of a bunch of different kinds of hard drives, which increases the complexity of your system.<p>Now, you could make some sort of minimum requirements (e.g. must be from vendor X, Y or Z, must be at least 7200rpm, must be at least 3tb, must be &#x27;raid edition&#x27; etc...)  and that /might/ work... it&#x27;d still be hard to overcome problem 1.  (I suppose it would be a reasonable way to exploit &#x27;loss leader&#x27; &#x27;limit one&#x27; sales, but those are mostly for consumer-grade drives.)",1378717162

6352417,comment,6352230,6352230,4,0,vrnm,,,"The problem you need to solve determines which algorithms you need to use and which data structures allow those algorithms to perform well. However, that&#x27;s just whiteboard computer science.<p>Nowadays, performance depends almost exclusively on memory bandwidth usage and spatial and temporal memory locality, i.e. the only thing that matters is how much memory you are moving and how you are traversing it (the number of additions/divisions/branches doesn&#x27;t matter that much).<p>In other words, your machine prefers data structures with good memory locality which determine which algorithms you can use and which problems are fast to solve. That is, in real life (as opposed to white board computer science) the order is inverted.<p>The question is: are you constrained at all by the machine? Because if you can solve the problems you want to solve without knowing about memory, then you obviously don&#x27;t need to know about memory. On the other hand, if you are constrained by computing time, power consumption and so on, then you either learn about memory or can&#x27;t solve your problem.<p>Again in other words, if you can get the job done in ruby/python/haskell/java/lisp... then do it!

We tend to be very suspicious of people on average.<p>A couple of years back my father, who teaches at a Nigerian university, got a call from his head of department who was in Europe at the time. He needed help clearing some important items that were being held by customs who were demanding payment to release a moderately valuable shipment into the country while he was away.<p>My dad was put in contact with an agent who requested some money to sort things out. At first, it was a token amount, but things escalated gradually to the point where he was considering &quot;borrowing&quot; money from both my sister and myself (we were both on scholarships while at university). My sister was home at the time and grew suspicious from the outset but my dad was totally convinced that the voice was authentic and that the caller simply knew too much. It was actually offensive for my sister to presume that he was that naive.<p>Fortunately, he fought the need to save face by not disappointing his boss in a crisis and told the agent that he couldn&#x27;t send any more money. The numbers were disconnected immediately afterwards and his Head of department had no idea what he was talking about when he eventually returned. He didn&#x27;t push the matter any further as it would be embarrassing to admit that he was conned.<p>This was a well calibrated psychological attack designed to take advantage of his personality and reputation as a man that can be relied on. It also preyed on his need to maintain his social standing among his peers. He had nothing to gain from this other than gratitude and an appeal to greed would have set off red flags immediately.<p>My conclusion was that this was probably engineered by some students who knew them both fairly well.<p>419 scams are fairly common in Nigeria and you become a target if you are perceived to be wealthy or recently come into some money. The &quot;Yahoo boys&quot; are ridiculous though because they are fairly easy to spot and are only marginally literate. It is part of a foreign condescending attitude to assume that that level of poor presentation is an acceptable standard for an educated Nigerian. Most of us think people who are scammed are suckers but it&#x27;s an evolutionary game and some of the scammers are really efficient predators.",1378714770

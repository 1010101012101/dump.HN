All of the top friends links point to MySpace's special link catching program, and if it was a real profile, the links would appear normal because MySpace doesn't block links to or from its own site.<p>Good fake, though.  I should've researched it a little more.  The problem is that a lot of people are going to buy it.  Oh, well...can't save everyone.",1199003228

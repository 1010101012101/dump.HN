250140,comment,249898,249898,0,0,tx,,,"The question is wrong. They should have asked ""Who wants to be next Steve Jobs?"" I suspect not too many: most technical entrepreneurs are more interested in quickly making a ""widget"" of some sort and sell out to the first real business that comes along.<p>Some may argue that personal computers in the 70s can be compared to web-widgets of today: the public at large didn't look at them as at ""real computers"" and few believed in truly global adoption. In that regard early PC pioneers were swimming against the flow.<p>While today, the entrepreneurial mantra is to ""figure out where everybody is going and be there first"", being ""part of the flow"" is crucial (any VC will tell you that). And nobody bothers with re-thinking anything: hey, ideas are nothing, execution is the king. Build something fast. Be in a browser. Get on TechCrunch.<p>Next Steve won't grow out of making half-assed JavaScript reimplementations of existing desktop software. And I honestly have no idea what the Next Steve will do. I know for sure, that what we're doing today is sorta ""configuration files"" for software built in the 50s. Perhaps this is what they call a ""matured industry"" and perhaps looking for a next Steve Jobs is as practical as looking for a next Henry Ford.",1216410954

This means that either you don't debug code, or you have to restart the Django dev server every time you make a change. Very annoying.<p>Also, I haven't been able to find any Eclipse/IDEA level features in a Python IDE... things like being able to ctrl+click on an object to see where it was defined, or a ""Find Usages"" feature.<p>All in all, I think there is a huge opportunity to innovate in the web IDE department.

Yahoo will occasionally, for no known reason, put our first email into spam. From then on, unless the user explicitly marks that email as not spam, yahoo bounces all future emails sent to that user with a ""mailbox doesn't exist"" message.<p>I've repeatedly had to do phone support where I directed the user to their spam folder to find our very first email. Once that gets ok'd we no longer have any trouble with that specific user.<p>On the topic of hotmail, this article is interesting:

Don't screw up your grades, they are your ticket to the future. When I found out 4-year universities did not care about dropped courses, I started keeping my ""A"" classes, and dropping everything else.<p>Not good advice, Most 4 year universities wont let you do this but only two times. Even then, your main focus is getting the degree. 3.5 and 3.0 gpa is no different in interviewing for jobs. Most of the jobs(4) I interviewed with right out of school never asked, Only retake classes you have to or classes that are in your major and you enjoy. Don't waste more years and MONEY.

It's usually the tradeoff with space.<p>2) good schools - ditto<p>3) this was a downside of the suburbs - I'd much prefer a nearby park that I don't have to own, mow, etc.  I ended up buying a new house with a very small (2800sf) lot, most of which is covered by our house<p>4) My kids are still small, but we've got the same variety of people here as in the city (basically traded white & black for white & hispanic)<p>The biggest issue that forced us to move was $/sqft.  We could afford a one bedroom in a city neighborhood we were comfortable with but not a 2br.  We moved and although my salary is much higher, we have another kid and we'd need a 3br soon.<p>Space, Commute, Safety, Schools. Pick 2 (or 3 if you're lucky).

Young hackers cannot even think about doing a startup without first considering funding and finding connections.<p>Also, working for Microsoft or Google, you can make very very good salary (perhaps multitude more than your folks), so if you're a capable young hacker, the typical path is going corporate or study abroad for grad school.<p>Before we can get a Chinese Jobs, we need a Chinese PG to insulate the potential Jobses from the legal mess, provide key connections and offer validation to family and friends.",1216408878

Which makes it worth at least 200,000,000 dollars ... at least, not just the peanuts they wonna throw at, 20 mil is nothing<p>XOBNI makes email fun again ... and easy ... and those are values.... see values not feature<p>So outlook without xobni is lame, and  nobody wonna use it, not add XOBNI and suddenly everyone wonna jump and spend the whole day inside outlook, ore more specifically XOBNI<p>Sayin XOBNI is just a feature is like saying RoR is just a lib for Ruby ...... nooooooooo, Ruby is just a feature of RoR, want proof .... DJANGO and Grails both Rails like,<p>see the tables are truned, the language is the feature ... notthe other way around<p>python is a feature in DJANGO and Groovy is a feature in Grails, but rails is the way ... man, rails is the way<p>Tomorrow you will see XOBNI for GMAIL , XOBNI for Yahoo Mail , XOBNI for Mutt even... and when this happens Outlook becomes a feature of XOBNI and not the XOBNI a feature of Outlook<p>And again Bill Gates HIMSELF complemented Xobni, this alone makes Xobni worth more than 20 mil<p>Xobni is the next google, those guys are gonna be billionaires, just like how Linus Torvalds became one for inventing Git ... okay so Git may not have turned Linus into a billionaire, but than its not as revolutionary as XOBNI ... and most important Bill Gates, the richest man thant he once was, never compliment Git or said it was any good",1209732999
179438,comment,179338,179338,0,0,aneesh,,,"> <i>Duh? What is Xobni OTHER THAN a feature of Outlook?</i><p>Everyone can criticize all they want, but this is a clear case of asymmetric information.  Xobni knows a lot more about their value than you or I do.  But even with the limited information I have, I have to say they are a lot more than just a feature.<p>With the Yahoo! Mail release (and I'm guessing GMail/hotmail/other client releases in the pipeline), what they're really doing is being a hub for all your contacts, attachments, and online interactions, INDEPENDENT of your email client.  I use 4 different email addresses, and at least a couple different email clients for various reasons.<p>With this synchronization across mail clients, Xobni has transformed itself from an analytics feature to a full-fledged network to manage your contacts and interactions.  I could see this integrating powerfully with, for example, Salesforce.com.",1209732949

For instance, I believe that Fred Wilson [of A VC blog fame] has commented along these lines about his investment in Twitter.  In some of these instances, the plan appears to be to focus on building a large active user base, preferably one that gets ""locked in"" via a network effect and then figuring out how to monetise.<p>I am interested to hear about the ""bunch of possible directions"" you can see.

In the last blog post to which you refer I gave a personal account of the usefulness of Xobni to me, and wasn't presenting a research paper.<p>I'd be delighted to hear the ways you think they can monetise the product/feature, partly to demonstrate the amount of thought you've given the matter.<p>In its current incarnation, Xobni is a tool aimed at the individual user.  Obviously, the company/product can go in all sorts of directions but so can anyone given time/money/effort.<p>Let's consider the possibility that their current offering is a prelude to looking at the corporate market. There are already tools that seek to discover corporate relationships at a macro level from data mining email inboxes, albeit they are only starting to make inroads into businesses. They work unobtrusively behind the scenes to provide business ""intelligence"" which can include highlighting colleagues who appear to have active communications with a ""target"".<p>You should also consider that many CRM tools already enable emails to be automatically incorporated into the communication profile/history of a contact, supplemented by richer tools than Xobni presently offer [task mgt, workflow] e.g. salesforce, zoho crm, siebel.",1209730610

Where most people look at one or two cars ahead and hopefully the one behind, my Dad taught me to look at <i>every</i> car that I can see, using every gap, window, mirror etc to be aware of my surroundings. Look at people, bus stops, crossings, shops in towns etc.<p>He also suggested that rather than just looking at a car, you look at the position of the car, who&#x27;s driving, the age, have I seen them drive weirdly yet?

8722404,comment,8716562,8717230,0,0,vidarh,,,">  The announcement itself doesn&#x27;t go into much detail as to which technologies those would be, though.<p>That&#x27;s part of the point. They want to be free to compose components depending on their customers needs.<p>CoreOS already includes Fleet (orchestration of individual units), and their are putting effort into Flannel (overlay network), and Kubernetes (orchestration of &quot;pods&quot; of containers).<p>But their market is enterprises that in many cases will want to fit CoreOS into an existing enterprise platform.<p>Nothing in how CoreOS is acting has shown any indication that they think enterprise is &quot;simple&quot;. On the contrary, Rocket, while smaller in scope than Docker, if anything is more complex (with the signing, composability of filesets, and implied support for running systemd in the containers).<p>I&#x27;m not convinced Rocket is the right thing - they&#x27;ll have to show me tooling that makes it as simple as Docker first - but some of the decisions appeals to me (a clear spec for the format, that alternative runtimes can conform to; e.g. nothing appears to prevent someone from making a Rocket runtime (&quot;ACE&quot;) that uses KVM or Virtualbox or Xen, and hence it could be potentially supported by things like OpenStack, or even shoehorned into a VMware deployment; making things like whether or not an overlay filesystem is used an implementation detail; and while I won&#x27;t need it often, and it may be an annoyance in some cases, support for signed images).<p>So I just see nothing to imply that CoreOS is a good exponent for some idea of &quot;simple, lightweight enterprise platform&quot;. They are providing a set of tools that <i>individually</i> are simple and lightweight, that you can use to start building the lower levels of an enterprise platform with, though, and understandably don&#x27;t want one of those tools to grow into a platform itself (whether or not Docker will grow into that in a way that doesn&#x27;t allow the core container execution mechanism to be easily lifted out, is a separate discussion).",1418129472

Whether it is an event, concert, news or a social trending topic. By taking a glimp, check in, add the description and air it so that your friends and whole world gets to explore it. A glimp is a 24 second video that you record when you instantly want to share the moment. For example, you can see what’s happening in a certain conference, Beyoncé concert , football match or night club through people taking glimps there. It is a map based application where you roam the world and choose where you want to see glimps. Moreover, smart search helps you to look for a certain user, hash tag or location (locations are powered by Foursquare). You can follow your friends and other users that air interesting glimps. So how do we guarantee it is live and not old post? Simply any glimp is taken through the app only and live for all users on map and user’s profile only for 12 hours and then it disappears. To show appreciation you can ‘airplus’ a glimp and that automatically gives the glimp more minutes to stay on the map with maximum limit of 24 hours. 
Our alpha version is now ready and we would be happy to know your feedback by sending it to your iPhone. Our beta version will be on the app store in couple of weeks. You can visit our website at www.glimpnow.com and Facebook page at www.facebook.com/Glimpnow",1418129297

It&#x27;s only after a while at this level, perhaps after a few scares or accidents, that a new appreciation for unusual risks starts to come in. You start to become less optimistic, and consider what could go wrong, not just what&#x27;s likely to go wrong.

So we fun it publicly, as a tax, which generally works[1]. Similarly, it might be useful to make a publicly-funded service that is charged with creating software infrastructure such as TLS or even libc that are difficult to fund directly.<p>There are a few advantages to using public funds: unlike traditional Free Software, as it uses public funds, the output would be <i>public domain</i>, and usable by anybody, commercial uses included. Also, as it doesn&#x27;t have to worry about VC money drying up or &quot;maximizing shareholder value&quot;, it would be easier to stick to a mandate that emphasizes quality instead of time-to-market.<p>On the other hand, problems with this idea would be the general concerns about corruption due to political meddling, and how to keep the NSA from pulling a BULLRUN on it like they did to NIST.<p><speculation>
Perhaps a &quot;dept. of software infrastructure&quot; could take over the &quot;defense&quot; side that the NSA seems to be neglecting recently. Moving all industry interaction (and trust) over to the new, open group so the NSA was known as spying-only might improve the relationship a bit...

As a commercial pilot and experimental aircraft owner, I can tell you that if the UAV community does not start to self-police these types of excursions, either by education or with software solutions (like the GPS-limiter mentioned in the article), then the regulating bodies will do it for them.<p>Most HN readers would agree that there is huge potential for UAV technology, but one needs only to look at the glacial progress of certified aviation technology in both the US and Europe to see that over-regulation can and does stifle innovation.<p>For readers familiar with the differing regulations in the US for experimental category amateur-built aircraft vs. certified light aircraft, you&#x27;ve seen the wide gap between what is possible to do with technology and what is legal to certify.  In most cases, an aircraft built in your garage is far superior in display and sensor technology than your average certified airplane.  This trend has only recently started to self-correct.<p>The point is, US organizations such as the EAA and AOPA do a tremendous amount of work to educate their members and to lobby Congress to ensure that what limited freedoms we have are maintained.  I think the UAV community needs something similar or their industry will get regulated to death -- especially after the first drone gets ingested into a jet engine.",1418127170

FOSS projects already have their &quot;Donate&quot; pages. You have to convince them and their users that your service is somehow superior.

You know the theorists are probably right, you know the published data is probably right, but who can resist the experiment? Seeing is believing!<p>Taking a cold-call from a recruiter is on the list of ""things I have tried in the whimsical spirit of experimentation"". It did not go well. Fortunately, I was ready for that.

Companies are often desperate to hire, efficient recruiting is not a skill that everyone is blessed with, so they sometimes take fliers on bad recruiters as well.

4724691,comment,4718468,4722773,1,0,davidcuddeback,,,"Thanks for the links. They were entertaining. But I'm afraid they don't provide evidence to support the claim that audiophiles can't tell the difference between audiophile equipment and more mundane equipment.<p>You've shown two anecdotes of audiophile reviewers making claims that a high-end digital cable improves audio quality. We both know that those claims are bunk. But picking a couple of anecdotes doesn't qualify as conclusive evidence. For example, I could find a few scientists that claim that global warming isn't real. But those scientists have a dissenting opinion from the rest of the scientific community on global warming. Hence, the anecdotes don't indicate the overall trend.<p>Every field has its share quacks. Showing me a couple anecdotes doesn't convince me that an entire field is filled with quacks.<p><i>> If anybody can reliably distinguish the expensive SATA cable from a regular one in a proper blind test, then I will cheerfully retract all of the above.</i><p>I appreciate that you're approaching this with skepticism. I think that's the right approach. I highly doubt that anyone will ever be able to distinguish between SATA cables in a blind study, so I think our conclusions about digital signal cables will hold.<p>The lack of skepticism on the part of the reviewers is the real problem we're seeing here. This quote from your second ZDNet link is telling:<p><i>I know full well that it is scientifically' not possible for a data cable to exert such influence but I know what we heard and hoped that maybe someone might be able to throw some light on what might be going on.</i><p>I wouldn't be surprised the reviewer really did hear a difference, but it was probably in his head. (Even though he admits that he knows its impossible.) Enjoying music is a psychological process, which makes it even <i>more</i> important to do double-blind tests when doing a comparison in order to remove expectation bias.<p>This problem, I admit, is prevalent among hi-fi reviews. I've read a lot of reviews of different stereo equipment and not once seen a reviewer use a double-blind test. I've heard that a lot of times, reviewers have a financial incentive to post glowing reviews. I don't know how true that is. If it is true, that will probably make it harder to get reviewers to adopt double-blind testing. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes (ZDNet author) should be commended for taking Malcolm Steward (hi-fi blogger) to task over his SATA cable reviews. I'd love to see hi-fi reviewers take a more scientific approach.<p>However, it does not follow that all audiophiles are incapable of discerning the differences in equipment. First of all, the evidence we've looked at so far only concerns reviewers. We haven't looked at hobbyists. Do hobbyists accept everything that the reviewers write? It's one thing for a reviewer to write a glowing review for a new product (especially when the manufacture pays a lot of money for ads in their magazine). It's quite another for someone to actually spend hard-earned cash on that new product. Lastly, we've only discussed digital cables so far. Which isn't really fair, because that's not a component that <i>can</i> make a difference. What about DACs, amplifiers, and speakers? Do you honestly think that audiophiles can't tell the difference between a good speaker and a budget speaker? Even better, do you have any evidence that that's true?<p>I honestly don't know the answers to these questions. If I was a betting man, I would bet that a lot of people can tell the difference between cheap and mid-range, but I have no clue about mid-range and high-end. (Say, for example, $30 headphones from Best Buy versus $300 Sennheissers versus $3000 planar magnetic headphones.) So it's also going to depend on how we define ""audiophile equipment"" versus ""mundane equipment."" Are we comparing the $3000 headphones to the $300 ones or the $300 pair to the $30 pair? I suspect it will make a difference which ones we decide to compare.<p>My point in all of this is that more evidence is needed to substantiate a claim as large as, ""not even audiophiles can distinguish much audiophile equipment from more mundane equipment in a blind test."" Just like you're demanding a double-blind test for the reviewers to prove a difference in cables, I'm demanding a more representative sample of evidence from you to substantiate your claim that an entire group of people can't distinguish between two classes of equipment.<p>In case you're wondering why this matters so much to me, it's because of two reasons. (1) Generalizations about groups of people are the root of prejudice. (2) I want to build a better stereo system for myself. If there's a categorical bias within the audiophile community, knowing the details of that bias (e.g., at what price point does the bias start to outweigh the actual differences in equipment) could significantly reduce the solution-space that I have to search within. Telling me that some people believe that there's a difference in digital signal cables doesn't help. I already know that. And I already know that that's bunk.",1351713315

4724678,comment,4724384,4724626,2,0,Stefan_H,,,"There are also some very important facets to Information security that you are missing.  You describe security as being ""based on knowing, doing, or owning something that no one else can"".  But this is not quite right.  You are speaking to only one aspect of security - confidentiality.  There is also integrity and availability.  Additionally, you are only speaking to the authentication aspect of confidentiality.  Your ""knowing, doing, or owning"" could be more succinctly described as authorization based off of ""something you know, something you have, or something you are"" which are the 3 main ways that someone could be identified as you they claim to be.  Your signature example would generally fall under something you are - but an argument could be made for it being something you know as well.<p>EDIT:<p>You also described Public key cryptography as having ""2 different keys. One allows for encryption and the other for decryption. In this case, the decryption key is public so everyone can decrypt.""  This misses the mark a little bit.  The public key could be used to encrypt as well, so that only the holder of the private key can read the information.  Using the private key to encrypt is generally used in digital signatures so that the recipient can verify that the sender is who they claim to be.  This scenario doesn't attempt to keep the data secret, because anyone with access to the public key can decrypt the data.",1351712937

They not only have more ""billboards"" for ads, but more ways to extract more data, and more meaningful data about its users. More data, more targetted ads, more money. (Google Play may also make some money selling digital goods, a la Kindle Fire)<p>2) This lessens their reliance on other platforms/browsers to use Google as their default search engine. On a non-Google browser, they would have to pay to be the default search engine (Firefox/Safari), or even worse, not be the default search engine at all (IE).<p>3) A last, small advantage is that with browser/device marketshare they can push for particular web technologies that are beneficial for Google.<p>So it's not entirely accurate to say that it's $0 per year for Google; someone has definitely made the calculations for #1 and #2 before pricing the Nexus 7.",1351712675

Sorry about that.<p>I was referring to what Lehrer said about Bob Dylan and ""Like a Rolling Stone"". His narrative about Dylan's biography and his creative process was totally off  not consistent with what even a casual fan like myself has picked up over the years. It wasn't just a little odd here and there, it was screamingly wrong. The idea that Dylan got stuck between ""Bringing it all back home"" (March 1965) and ""Highway 61 Revisited"" (Aug 1965) is laughable  that was the middle of the greatest creative rampage of his career, his annus mirabilis. Everybody knows that that manic phase peaked in ""Blonde on Blonde"" (1966) and the crash happened afterward. Lehrer's fairy tale about how Dylan was going to quit music (!) but it turned out he just needed to take a little rest and then, boom, a creative outpouring and out came ""Like a Rolling Stone"", was silly. Dylan had been pouring out material in that way for years. Lehrer's thing about how there had been only two kinds of pop song and Dylan finally put them together in ""Like a Rolling Stone"" is cringeworthy, the kind of thing you would tolerate in a precocious adolescent until you could take him off to one side and tell him to knock it off and learn something. Then there were howlers like claiming that while writing the song Dylan coined the term ""juiced"" to mean ""drunk"". That was as ignorant as Gladwell's ""igon values"" but worse, since it indicates a readiness to make shit up to fit your narrative.<p>My point is that these things weren't just wrong, they were obvious concoctions. And someone who would bullshit that much about one thing would clearly bullshit about anything. If he hadn't fabricated quotes and plagiarized, that would still be the case. And it's not like people didn't call him on it, even before he got caught on the no-nos [1].<p>What bugs me, and I'm almost done, is that Lehrer's editors and patrons were quite happy for him to propagate this kind of thing. Not in a ""sure it's crap but we need material"" way, but in a ""take a look at this! he's a wunderkind!"" way. Had he not gotten grandiosely sloppy, he'd not only still be doing it, he'd still be widely praised for doing it. He'd be in that elite group of repeat guests on Fresh Air, maybe even the super-elite who are allowed to say ""thank you"" when Terry says ""Welcome back to Fresh Air"". So to me this was a little like a criminal who eventually got busted on a technicality.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/magazine/103912/bob-dylan-jonah-lehrer-creativity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/magazine/103912/bo...</a>.

Maybe you could try reading through the Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics Wikipedia page[1] to get a better sense of the issues being talked about here?  Whether or not waveforms collapse at a certain scale is precisely the most important issue of disagreement here, and it actually is subject to experiment in theory.  And experiment could probably even distinguish between the various families of waveform collapse too.  Not that this will distinguish between all interpretations, but it would at least cut the possible number in half.<p>Remember, waveform collapse or ""some new physics which makes QM break at a certain scale"" was actually the assumption of the people who started quantum physics, and the default assumption of popular writing including the article we're discussing.  It wasn't until much later that Everett proposed that it might be an unnecessary hypothesis like Maxwell's aether.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mech...</a>",1351710788

It stank to me of being someone who didn't even <i>know</i> what joeyh was producing with his setup, and just brushed him off as ""not productive"", when I really feel that joeyh's example is something to, at a bare minimum, study as an example of what's possible when you slow down and focus on the code and design instead of dual 30in monitors and teh shinee.<p>Furthermore, GP, yes, worth is a totally artificial human construct; while you may value social interaction more than others, I tend to see developing open source software as being an almost infinite good, as it can improve innumerable peoples' lives, albeit only a little bit at a time.

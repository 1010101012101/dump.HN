There should be a better way, learning from users actions instead of querying them directly.<p>In fact I think Google already has these ways, with Google Toolbar, Google Analytics and Adwords tracking users behaviours among other things.<p>So I suspect, if this voting stuff comes, it would be more psychological than technical? Maybe people are happier with a site if they are allowed to ""vent"".<p>A bit like the escalator engineers who placed mirrors next to the escalators so that people would not notice the waiting time so much. It doesn't improve the technology, but makes people happier.",1216284666

248339,comment,247652,247652,0,0,mleonhard,,,"It will be great to refuel our vehicles from the electric grid.  Next we need a dynamic pricing scheme where the price of electricity varies in real time, based on the instantaneous demand.  Then add a protocol for devices to learn the current price and reserve and purchase their own electricity.<p>That will let our cars recharge their compressed air tanks in the middle of the night, when electricity is cheap.  It will also let our refrigerators and air conditioners use cheap electricity to store up ""coldness"" in ice for use during the day.  Single-compartment washer-dryers can wash and dry our clothes when electricity is cheap.<p>And once realtime energy pricing is widespread, we may even see companies shipping their large computing jobs to run in datacenters that currently have cheap electricity.",1216283791

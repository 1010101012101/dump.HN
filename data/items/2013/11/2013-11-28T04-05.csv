At the time, most other SSD drives on the market used horrible JMicron flash controllers that were more suitable for your camera&#x27;s memory card; they were not really designed to cope with the traffic a desktop operating system would throw at them.<p>Back in the Vertex/Vertex2 days they really were the ones to beat for the most part. But then Intel came along with their incredibly stable SSDs and frankly, OCZ&#x27;s drives started to seem like toys.<p>Part of OCZ&#x27;s problem is that, starting with the Vertex 2 era, dozens of other companies used Sandforce controllers just like OCZ did. At that point OCZ obviously tried to compete on price and we can see what it did to their quality. To their credit, they made a really commendable last stab at relevance when they bought Indilinx so they could have their own custom controller and (maybe?) stop competing on price. Those drives got some great reviews although I don&#x27;t know if they were reliable or what.",1385613073

That will allow you to read and make sense of financial statements. There is no other way, if you&#x27;re an active, vs. passive, investor.

Diversification is not as important if you know what you&#x27;re doing. And you don&#x27;t have to sit around if the market is fairly priced, just when it&#x27;s high. During that time, when you&#x27;re not doing much investing, you should be reading, studying, and aspire to get into more special situations (arbitrage) and look for Ben Graham style net nets with micro to small cap companies that aren&#x27;t as popular. Even OTC market value investing with your own scuttlebutt. There aren&#x27;t much of those so you have to see what ratios people substitute for those nowadays. For example, you&#x27;re not going to find decent insurance companies selling at less than their working capital minus total debt. Those used to exist after the Great Depression. Now you have to find companies say, selling at some higher ratio than what would have made a decent margin of safety in those days.

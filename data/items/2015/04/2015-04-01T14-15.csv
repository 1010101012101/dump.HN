We&#x27;re Nilas (pronounced ny-las) and our team is building the next generation email platform, starting with beautiful APIs.<p>Developers depend on our APIs, so we have to be reliable, up all the time, and fast. We have more data for a single user than in most startups&#x27; entire database. That means big technical challenges to solve as we scale our fledgling distributed backend. We&#x27;ve also been working on a new email client, and we&#x27;re looking for product designers and front-end engineer. We&#x27;re using React, Flux, and a fork of Atom Shell.

We want to make that number 50%.<p>• Our sunny Mission office is more lived-in than tidy. Think art studio, not corporate. Our team is more likely to end up in Yosemite or on a bike ride together than drinking at the latest startup event.<p>• We have a flexible vacation policy and value personal responsibility and ownership. Benefits include full health, dental, vision, commuter, and lunch at the office every day.

Everyone&#x27;s more or less right about the conservation of matter argument here, but everyone commenting is missing the <i>aquifers</i> and they&#x27;re the key. Aquifer water is pure and clean, lovely and ancient. It&#x27;s trickled down into its cracks between rocks over thousands and millions of years.<p>When California growers tap into aquifers to grow their almond-beef-whatever, they&#x27;re not using a renewable resource. They&#x27;re using a very finite resource. The aquifers in CA are in real danger of tapping out. Why do we care?<p>1) it takes a huge amount of infrastructure to move around surface water<p>2) it takes a huge amount of infrastructure to clean surface water, whether we&#x27;re just taking out the antibiotic residue and dirt and THC or desalinating<p>3) the cost of this transportation and purification infrastructure will dramatically impact where people can live and grow their food.<p>Moreover, aquifer depletion has some funky effects. Sinkholes in Florida that swallow houses come from aquifer depletion -- the ground there is riddled with holes that really need to full of water if you want to support weight [1]. Some lakes start draining if they&#x27;re (somewhat unusually) geologically linked to a declining aquifer, like White Bear Lake in Minnesota [2]. Part of the culprit in MN is that people can drill wells and use up to 10,000 gallons per day <i>without a permit</i>. Switching to surface water is an option in the Midwest, and the municipalities mentioned in MN are thinking about switching to Mississippi river water. But in central California, what surface water are you going to use?<p>Last, for the self-interested, aquifer water often makes the best beers :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.livescience.com/27659-florida-sinkhole.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.livescience.com/27659-florida-sinkhole.html</a>

As an employer, not only do I have to pay a ~30% tax over the salary of each employee (to pay this healthcare system) - in the end you must resort to private healthcare as the system is  terrible. If your not half dead, you will wait hours and hours  (not even kidding) trying to be attended. Aside from waiting hours and hours on end just to be attended, the doctors treat you like crap, the nurses treat you like crap - no one cares if you live or die.<p>Story:
My wife&#x27;s brother was crossing the street and was hit by a car, pretty badly at around 8pm. He was able to get able, and they took him to this public hospital. He has bleeding, vomiting (from concussion) and he waiting over 12 hours to be attended. The only they did was give him an IV for his dehydration (due to excessive vomiting for 12 hours from concussion), told him he was fine and to go home. He asked for a pill for vomiting, and doctor told him to go across the street to the pharmacy to buy it. Yes, really.<p>The private healthcare sector here is pretty good. A bit expensive, but good. I could have had my kids here in the &quot;Caja&quot; (public hospital) for free, but after hearing tons of complaints and horror stories it was better to just pay a $5000-$6000 fee to the doctors and hospital in the private sector to have each of my kids born.<p>Costa Rica is absolutely not a model for it&#x27;s healthcare system. It&#x27;s expensive, in huge debt, it&#x27;s terrible, and no one cares about you. Would not recommend.",1427899258

Teachers, parents, and other authority figures didn&#x27;t understand what motivated this behavior, but with the benefit of hindsight I now do.  I wasn&#x27;t breaking things at all, I was exploring them.  I was learning how they worked by taking them apart and seeing them laid bare.  Sometimes, I&#x27;d manage to put them back together and occasionally they&#x27;d even work!<p>Once, when I was about twelve or thirteen, I took apart a mechanical bedside alarm clock, laid all the gears out organized by size and was promptly grounded for &#x27;destroying&#x27; it.  While serving my punishment, I went to work re-assembling it, with one small change.  What had previously been a cheap cardboard clock face was replaced with a piece of translucent contact-paper, with numbers careful stenciled in their proper places.  I loved that clock.  Every morning I&#x27;d wake up, see it, and glance deep into its inner workings.  That visual reminder that I&#x27;d been curious and unlocked its secrets was how I started mornings throughout my formative years.<p>Somewhere along the line, I lost track of where that clock ended up.  It may be gone, but the spirit it demonstrates remains one of my strongest motivators.  I&#x27;ve found no better outlet for this drive to understand the inner workings of things than software security assessment.<p>At Matasano, we treat our client&#x27;s applications like I did that clock.  We take them apart, examine them piece by piece, and arrive at an understanding of what makes them tick.  Only after arriving at this can we find and exploit vulnerabilities.  We slap a clear face on those applications, with the numbers carefully identifying any discovered flaws.  We take them apart and &#x27;break&#x27; them, not to be destructive, but to be constructive through understanding them.  Thankfully, we don&#x27;t even end up grounded. :)<p>There&#x27;s no area of computing that draws on as many skills, but programming, debugging, protocol analysis, reverse engineering, systems administration, network engineering and cryptographic analysis  aren&#x27;t what make great AppSec consultants.  You need to find what motivates you. For me, being tasked with quickly developing a deep understanding of unfamiliar applications plays right into the mindset that led me to explore that clock.<p>So, again I&#x27;ll ask, what excites you?<p>Learn about our hiring process at <a href=""http://www.matasano.com/careers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.matasano.com/careers</a> or contact us at careers@matasano.com<p>Get a taste for some of what we do at <a href=""http://www.microcorruption.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.microcorruption.com</a> and <a href=""http://www.cryptopals.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cryptopals.com</a><p>Check out our blog at <a href=""http://chargen.matasano.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chargen.matasano.com</a><p>~<i>-,._.,-</i>~&#x27;`^`&#x27;~<i>-,._.,-</i>~&#x27;`^`&#x27;~<i>-,._.,-</i>~&#x27;`^`&#x27;~<i>-,._.,-</i>~&#x27;`^`&#x27;~<i>-,._.,-</i>~",1427898615

We have roughly 4,000 R&D employees, so work is very diverse across the company. Teams are roughly 4-8 people at the lowest level and group up into larger organizations organized by product type (equities, fixed income, etc.). I happen to work on infrastructure for the Professional service (aka Terminal). Our team has very little interaction with anything finance related and most of our work is related to evolving the entire platform forward and making forward-looking changes. Back in 2005, we converted all of our higher-level &quot;app&quot; development to server-side JS (custom, Spidermonkey based) and now run probably the largest server-side JS stack in the world. We migrated a lot of our GUI toolkit to be scripted as well (LUA this time) to allow us to more easily evolve it. And now we&#x27;re evolving it, embedding Blink and pushing bugfixes and feature enhancements to do what we need (our fork is on GH). We abstracted away our next-gen server-side infrastructure from specific JS engines and can now run it on top of Spidermonkey or V8 (or any other engine with a similar API) as we please. We&#x27;re helping define and implement CSS3 Grid spec and help implement ES6 generators/arrow functions among other things. We built and run a third-party app store within the Terminal. Over the past decade we&#x27;ve rebuilt the C++ foundation of the company from the ground up, starting with our own STL implementation using the Lakos allocator model (Lakos and a few other C++ committee members work here). We have a huge wealth of awesome C++ libraries that we started open-sourcing and will continue to add more layers as time goes by. (<a href=""https://github.com/bloomberg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bloomberg</a>)<p>All of what I mentioned above is stuff done by the infrastructure team, and we&#x27;re a tiny percentage of the overall R&D population. Other teams get to do fun stuff as well. The mortgage team ported long-running ABS OAS calculations from Linux farms to GPU clusters and wrote a Python based cash flow engine from the ground up, potentially helping define the SEC&#x27;s Python-files-must-be-included rules.<p>We run a worldwide network with somewhere around 35,000 circuits in 180+ countries. We ingest anywhere from 45-60 billion &quot;ticks&quot; daily aggregate from feeds in all of these countries. We normalize, scrub, and then re-distribute all this data to customers in all of those countries in an efficient manner. The Terminal provides analytic and visualization tools to work with market data, as well as the same tools to work with news and alerts. On the news side, we ingest over 100,000 news feeds (e.g. WSJ would be one &quot;feed&quot;) from around the world and do the same kind of processing, applying ML for sentiment and topic classification, etc. We also design our own hardware in-house -- everything from keyboards and monitors, to custom ASICs for authentication/subscription tokens. The web side (bloomberg.com, businessweek.com) are now Node based and the framework used to build them was also recently released on GitHub.<p>Oh, and we have a TV station, radio station, etc. They innovate too. Bloomberg TV was the first non-OTA channel to be distributed via Aereo, for instance. (Too bad it didn&#x27;t last... :))<p>We could use a motto like &quot;We do a lot of stuff.&quot;<p>Contact me if you want to discuss at andrew@ishiboo.com.

I know this. This is a UNIX system.<p>And then one day you install a new update of your ICANN package and all of a sudden when you do ls -l / you see /Documents and /Photos and /Music and /Google and /Ads (where the hell did that come from?), and suddenly it isn&#x27;t so familiar any more. Someone took your nice neat system which was good enough for Kernighan and Ritchie and RMS and Linus and everyone and they... just figured they&#x27;d ignore it.<p>I think the feeling techies get is just that there was a reason for that old approach. I can mount /bin from shared network storage and /usr from a workgroup server and okay I never actually do that on my MacBook Pro but that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s like that and it&#x27;s important to keep it like that in case... I ever find myself running a timeshared college computer network on a PDP11 and I need it to work just the same as my MacBook, okay?<p>And we have the same feeling about the TLD system.

We are used to living in an open system, where only absolute zero has a single microstate.

If the site was secure, my browser would figure that out and tell me it was secure. If the site wasn&#x27;t secure, it would figure that out too and warn me as such.<p>Of course, I realize that this is a tall ask given that you have conflicting brands around the world. Perhaps there should be some linguistically obvious [to the average non-I.T. person] way to differentiate between conflicting brands...<p>I feel like the most obvious should be that we should never have to negotiate security by typing HTTPS... that should be the <i>default</i> state, falling back to HTTP only if HTTPS was unavailable and a warning should be given to the user. The average user [indeed any user] should never have to &quot;look for HTTPS&quot; or &quot;look for the padlock&quot;. The whole browser UI should be more intuitive than that - the user should be able to look at the browser window and infer that communication with that site is not secure.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the address structure should be... perhaps something like(?)<p>ISO_COUNTRY_CODE/REGISTERED_COMPANY_NAME/SITE_NAME/PATH/TO/RESOURCE<p>Examples:<p>- UK/COMPANY/ARGOS/ABOUT-US [Brand Information Page]<p>- UK/COMPANY/ARGOS/ONLINE-STORE/HOME/FURNITURE/BEDROOM/KIDS/BEDS/PIRATE-SHIP-BED [Catalog Item]<p>- UK/COMPANY/ARGOS/STORES/ACOCKS-GREEN [For local information]<p>- US/COMPANY/AMAZON [Brand Home Page]<p>- US/COMPANY/AMAZON/STORE/ELECTRONICS/DVD/LORD-OF-THE-RINGS [Catalog Item]<p>- US/CHARITY/LIVESTRONG [Brand Home Page]<p>- CA/CHURCH/UNITED/SASKATOON [Localized Home Page]<p>Perhaps a global brand such as Amazon or Facebook wouldn&#x27;t even need a country code...or it could be figured out by an algorithm based on the user&#x27;s context: FACEBOOK
could map to UK/COMPANY/FACEBOOK for a person in the UK or US/COMPANY/FACEBOOK for a person in the U.S. The user could override the location by manually typing the address. If the user&#x27;s IP address belonged to Amazon in the US, then they could type in just the site and resource address and the rest of the address could be construed from their context: Typing in STORE/ELECTRONICS/DVD/LORD-OF-THE-RINGS would automatically be understood as: US/COMPANY/AMAZON/STORE/ELECTRONICS/DVD/LORD-OF-THE-RINGS. For a residential user, their IP would be assigned to the block for their country, so any sites not explicitly specified would infer a site within their own country.<p>If the country code isn&#x27;t known, then some algorithm could attempt to figure it out. If it was ambiguous, then the user could be presented with search results by a preconfigured [or their favorite] search engine.<p>Anyway - as Tim Berners Lee says... it&#x27;s too late now.

You do not need any Javascript experience to apply (we&#x27;ve hired many people without it) we find it easier to teach good engineers Javascript then to teach Javascript developers good software engineering skills.

We work in an Agile environment with daily Scrums, Retrospectives and 2 week sprints (though some teams have been experimenting with Kanban) and a real focus on the Engineering department owning the Engineering processes which means you get to spend your time writing code and have the autonomy to try changes to the processes and see if they work.
We&#x27;re looking for multiple engineers with a range of experience levels (from recent grads to Senior Developers) so I can&#x27;t specify specific salaries but I think they tend to be higher than most other Cardiff companies.

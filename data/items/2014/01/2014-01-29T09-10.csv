7142985,comment,7140231,7142772,18,0,patio11,,,"I&#x27;m in favor of paying one&#x27;s debts, have a credit record which would do a Lannister proud, and would not incur any obligation which I did not have the good faith intention to repay as agreed.  It&#x27;s just that I feel an extra special obligation to employees, on account of their unique relationship to their employer, their (presumed) degree of dependence on that relationship, and a heritage as both a Catholic and a Japanese salaryman which suggests that not paying an employee their due wages is a crime which cries out to heaven for vengeance.  (For those folks in the peanut gallery who aren&#x27;t Catholic or Japanese salarymen: that&#x27;s a thing for both, and it is a thing called exactly that by Catholics.  I&#x27;m aware many HNers don&#x27;t necessarily believe in it, but that doesn&#x27;t make me believe in it less.)<p>Vendors do not enjoy this status, although I&#x27;d make all reasonable efforts to have a business which I control pay them as agreed.  Reasonable efforts includes things like cash flow juggling, taking out debts in the name of the business, or reducing the size of my distributions.  They do not include my family experiencing hardship on your business&#x27; account.<p>Vendors are not assumed to be as vulnerable as employees.  They typically have far less concentration of income and far higher savvy with regards to the necessity of, e.g., keeping a cushion against the risk of receivables going sour.<p>I run a small company.  I work with lots of other ones.  Of the entire set of them, nobody is one invoice from death.  If we were, we&#x27;d be dead, because we&#x27;re well aware that individual invoices go missing all the damn time.  That&#x27;s <i>baked into</i> running a business with businesses as clients.<p>That&#x27;s also part of the reason why, when I do business with companies as a vendor and not as an employee, I charge a significant premium to what I&#x27;d earn as an employee.  The possibility of your business going belly up prior to paying my invoice exists.  I already priced it into my weekly rate (or your monthly rate for services or whatever).  If one of my clients was unable to pay due to their business ceasing to be a going concern, as a responsible businessman, when apprised of that I&#x27;d say &quot;Wow, sorry.  OK.&quot; and write off the debt.  It happens.  My accountant could probably tell you how much it cost us last year.<p>If the business owner said &quot;I&#x27;d really feel better paying you out of my own pocket for this.&quot; I&#x27;d literally refuse their money.  It&#x27;s not their family&#x27;s responsibility to backstop my business&#x27; cash flow management.  That&#x27;s my job, and part of the reason why I &quot;earn the big bucks&quot;, for values of big which are pretty modest.<p>(Prudentially speaking I&#x27;d probably treat a solo freelancer on a long term contract as an employee for the purpose of &quot;Should I reimburse this guy out of my own pocket?&quot;, but as a former consultant, I&#x27;d advise any of my freelancing friends to structure their affairs such that they don&#x27;t depend on payment of every invoice.)",1390989275

Here is the lesson to learn:\nIf you got funded and have to pay invoices, employees (including yourself), never hope for more investment. Shrink and - if necessary - finally close your business before (!!!!) you run out of money. This is true for startups, businesses, household budget, pocket money, girlfriends (hrmmm), etc.<p>Startup is a high risk, the statistical odds are against you. Investors know that. If they see you fail, they will not tell you, they will simply stop to invest (and may be think, you will go on to save their a...). Hope that you may find new investment means, you did not start looking early enough to know the odds.<p>I (we) were at the same position in 2001 when the internet bubble burst. I am happy to report, that our business needed heavy investment (like yours did) and it became clear to us, that there will be no more investment for internet business in the foreseeable future. So we did shut down with money on the bank, paid our debts, bought out our gadgets from the company and divided the money that we paid for the gadgets among the shareholders (us :o). \nBoth of us founders saw the startup as a business not as our baby. So we were able to look at it from a kind of outside perspective. This was not the reason why it failed, though, but it lifted us at eye level with the investors.<p>The way we handled it allowed us to book it as a very interesting experience.  We were immediately able to look forward.<p>But, here is the positive side: You got investments (a lot even), you survived for 2 years, which is great. Now get together with your co-founders in a nice place, drink a bottle or two of good wine and analyze your mistakes.<p>Sorry to say this now that it is late for you. But next time ...",1390988688

The biggest problem is doing it in a way that doesn&#x27;t bring you to the attention of those doing the blocking.<p><i>1.

Is it possible to conclusively determine censorship from headers only or do I have to load the whole page and compare HTML code with a sample? Bandwidth is very expensive here.</i><p>It depends on the method used to block you from visiting a website.<p>If DNS-based blocking is used, you can use very small DNS lookups to identify whether or not a website is blocked — all of the hostnames of blocked websites will probably resolve to the same IP address.  (You can check this with &quot;nslookup www.website.com&quot; in Windows or &quot;host www.website.com&quot; on Linux, OS X, etc.)  If this method works, it&#x27;s probably the best way — DNS requests are less likely to be logged than HTTP requests, and DNS requests and responses are small.<p>If the blocking uses a transparent proxy instead of forged DNS records, you could use HTTP HEAD requests and match against the &quot;Server&quot; header in the reply:<p><pre><code>    Server: Apache/2.2.12 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.2.12 OpenSSL/0.9.7d mod_wsgi/3.2 mod_perl/1.29 PHP/4.4.1\n</code></pre>\nThe software listed in that &quot;Server&quot; header is terribly old, and I doubt you&#x27;ll find any other web server on the Internet with that exact combination of software versions.  So that could be a way to identify the server serving the &quot;website blocked&quot; page without downloading entire pages, but it might draw attention to you if you do it for thousands of websites.",1390988635

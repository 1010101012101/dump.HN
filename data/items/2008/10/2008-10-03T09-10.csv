322559,comment,322156,322452,0,0,timr,,,"Which recession?  The last one (2002-2003) is a bad example, since many of the people who worked through it went crazy buying crap (i.e. houses, cars, granite countertops) with the flood of cheap credit that was used to ""stimulate"" the economy out of trouble.<p>I spent that period in grad school, and while I don't have houses and cars, I also have no debt.  I suspect I will end up better off in the long run -- we're just not there yet.",1223026073

I could up that but most of the failure cases are really unlikely.<p>Also, the test cases listed don't cover everything, like email addresses of the form ""I'm in quotes @#$!!!(&^*_+=""@domain.com which are technically valid.",1223025786

And the bottom is where all the real content is. Maybe reshuffle and/or shrink?<p>cheers<p>tom saffell",1223025637
322556,comment,321755,322527,0,0,andyking,,,"Agreed. I'm no supporter of the wars being waged, I marched in London in 2003 and personally think ""terror"" should be somewhere down the list of global concerns at present in the face of environmental pressures and the financial issues. If the resources being expended on these wars by our governments was instead spent on ending our dependence on oil by developing clean fuel technologies or on setting the foundations for a new, more stable economic system, we'd all be far better off.<p>However, that can't take away from the fact that the troops, working men and women from this city, this country and from all over the world doing a professional job and putting their necks on the line in this specious global conflict. To dismiss their contributions as ""iffy"" does them a grave disservice.",1223025527

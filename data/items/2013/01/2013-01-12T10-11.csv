It is trivial to show that there are dead-weight costs incurred when computer systems need to deal with DST across political boundaries.  Those costs alone should be sufficient to convince anyone to abandon DST (or just as well, adopt it full-time, as Russia recently did).  The fact that ""normal"" people do not know these costs exist is, I think, the main reason they are sympathetic to emotional arguments such as ""DST will save children's lives on Halloween"" or equally your ""DST kills drivers once or twice a year.""",1357988173

5047407,comment,5045764,5047114,1,0,dalke,,,"I think I was too loose (read ""wrong"") in my nomenclature. I wrote ""The IUPAC InChI keys are.."" when I should have written ""The IUPAC InChI strings are.."" There's the long InChI string, and the shorter InChi key. The key is the hash form of the string.<p>Generating the hash is, as you say, trivial given the InChI string. Computing the InChI string in the first place is not. It requires molecular perception of the input graph. For example, which of the hydrogen positions are mobile (eg, can be identical under tautomerization) and which are fixed? It also requires generating the canonical graph representation, which is done via a variation of the nauty algorithm. Usually it's quite fast. Some structures can take longer. By default there's a 60 second timeout.<p>I haven't worked with the InChI code for a while, so I don't know what the performance numbers are. An output log from 2009 shows ""Finished processing 2186 structures: 0 errors, processing time 0:00:05.93."" or 369/second = 2.7ms. Perhaps its under 1.0 ms now?<p>You estimated 323 milliseconds/record based on the numbers I gave. However, I did not describe the step which turns 977 million compounds into the actual number to evaluate. I would also include the combinations replacing Cl with F and with Br, and I would replace at most two of the nitrogens with a phosphorous. I may also have to try different hydrogen counts, depending on the types of structures in GDB-13. I guessed that this would require about 100x as much compute time as the base 977 million structures.<p>This is all meant as very rough estimates. It's only been a background thought until now, and I hadn't written it up before. In any case, the parameters are all quite tunable, in that I could crank up or down the problem size to match the available CPU time and researcher patience.",1357987937

5047394,comment,5046845,5047187,60,0,konstruktor,,,"Aaron Swartz did something he knew was morally right but very probably illegal in some way, and, him being a prodigy, I'm very confident he was aware of this. It is called activism, and is a very brave and noble thing to do, something most people don't have the guts for. Governments often try to break activists who threaten their agenda (or in this case, that of a dying industry), and it seems they have succeeded with him, which I find very sad and which makes me so angry.<p>Maybe being indicted while free may even be a bigger psychological pressure on somebody than being in prison. When you are in prison, you can focus all your energy on your case, and the situation can only get better than your current one, not worse. You have certain legal protections, and your basic needs are taken care of.<p>Imagine having to work a job to earn an income (your assets probably being seized) and function in society with a constant feeling of danger looming ahead. They can fuck up your life one little piece at a time. Imagine working on your defence when the computer you are using to do so can be seized at any time (some DA having convinced a judge that you may be hacking right now). Imagine restrictions on travel that make making a living even more difficult. Imagine randomly being delivered a letter with one more bogus charge.<p>While being free seems to be better than in prison from an objective point of view, given the workings of the threat detection system in our mind, made for tigers in the savannah, not constant worry and fear, it may be much worse. It is well known that the functioning of our ""higher"" abilities like creativity and critical thinking are impaired under constant stress. It's easy to conceive what this means for the feeling of self worth of somebody who lives for doing cool, meaningful, big things (one of my favourite essays ever, btw):
<a href=""http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/productivity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/productivity</a><p>Also, it neatly avoids the aura of illegitimacy that imprisoning peaceful activists would have for a government.<p>One lesson that could be learned from this is to try and consciously provide people in his situation with an environment that feels safe.

Now, while it's true that we can only <i>observe</i> those who did not commit suicide, we do have a substantial amount of data on humans in general that we can work from. If this claim has you skeptical (ie ""successful suicides are a separate reference class""), I will remind you we have data on suicidal people who were forcibly restrained, which you are encouraged to look up.<p>So now let's look at the core of brainless' argument: people change with time. If you look at happiness rates for quadriplegic patients (or any of the hedonic treadmill research), you'll see that your happiness levels aren't so impacted by life events. This effect is present in both the population of completed suicides, and aborted suicides, and is likely a lot of the causal force brainless is trying to reference.<p>Which is to say that it's highly likely that people who kill themselves counterfactually wish they didn't.",1357987298

At one point, I had been asked about it so much I actually started contemplating if I were to kill myself, how would I do it (mind you, this wasn't wanting to, or even entertaining the notion, but me going ""Why not actually think through the reality of it?"").  I came to the decision that if I were to ever kill myself, I would stab myself in the heart with a knife.  Yes, it would be excruciatingly slow and painful (can't quickly stab yourself and dodge ribs, have to drive the blade extremely deep to get the heart, etc.), but it would serve a singular purpose: to signal that it wasn't a quick decision, to absolve people from feeling like there was something more they could have done and to remove all doubt about how strongly I felt about making the particular decision.  When I explained this to the psychiatrist next time I was asked, his response was along the lines of ""Do you think someone would be capable of that?""  And the only response I had was ""If they wanted to end it all that badly, yes"".<p>All this as a long ways to get around to saying: I disagree with anything that may consider suicide appropriate in any situation as one persons personal decision and situation becomes an example or model that someone in a similar situation could look to.

I worked at a local crisis hotline in the Maryland area, and each one of these places ties into the national hotline, as it does (and please feel free to troll me) a round-robin process and tries to find the closest center given the area code of the caller.  I personally handled less than a dozen of these calls.  I cannot go into details because we all sign NDA's (surprise, surprise), but I will tell you in all my time we never had someone commit suicide.  Also, even volunteer people like myself are trained in suicidology assessment, and getting a stage 3 person warrants you calling law enforcement and/or emergency services given your discretion.  In my over a year there, I saw that happen only once when they thought it would be close.  I personally talked down many people, and it was my personal opinion those who called the hotline were rarely those were at a level so bad they were going to do it on the phone.<p>Just my two cents.",1357985990

The only reason DPRK is still here is because China doesn't want any massive influx of refugees (North Koreans can't cross into the South directly because of the landmines in the DMZ).<p>As much as I hate the current regime in China, I don't see them being a threat to world peace. The fear of totalitarian regimes is pretty much a BS notion manufactured by the American media. A totalitarian leader is only a threat to world peace under the following conditions: 1) He's extremely charismatic. 2) His country is running out of resources. 3) He believes he is under a great external threat.<p>China hasn't seen a charismatic leader since Mao, tho running out of resources, it is actively addressing it by developing renewable resources. There is also no country openly hostile to China, including Japan.<p>I don't have anything against Japan increasing meagerly its military budget, or even repeal Article 9. It's fully their right to do so as long as they are not hostile. But saying Japan is not potentially dangerous is not entirely correct. Japan is still mostly ruled by a right wing aristocracy that have extremely close relationship with the government officials during WWII. Economy has stagnated and arguable steadily declining since the 90s. It has almost no natural resources for an industrialized nation to speak of and it believes it is under constant thread from North Korea.

941898,comment,941739,941856,0,0,sorbus,,,"The article addresses that, albeit very shortly: ""It may seem arbitrary to focus on X, one of 23 chromosomes, but it has 8 percent (1,529) of all our genes, including some for fertility and intelligence, which affect reproductive success.""<p>Besides, it's one of the easiest things to see, and hence one of the easiest to look at - and, as it's sex-linked, there is a very clear way to see its effects (differentiating between paternal and maternal grandmothers, and their effects on their grandchildren of either sex). All the other ones have exactly a 25% chance to be transmitted to grandchildren, regardless of the path, and are therefor even more useless to look at.<p>I must agree, though, that it would be nice if the article had included more statistics about grandparents effects on the survival of children, and less explaining their theories and math.",1258221471
941897,comment,941740,941740,0,0,tom_b,,,"Snob or not, what increasingly pulls me to languages are the highly productive DSLs that seem to fall out of them.  For example, I need to deliver a few lightweight web apps/services - and I stumble across Sinatra on Ruby (with a little Sequel thrown in mixed with the oci8 oracle gem), which seems to do all I need.  My little ruby code snippets look just like that - snippets that are short and expressive of the what I'm trying to do.<p>Lisp seems to be the ""godfather"" of these things and I'm more and more interested in what makes <i>me</i> productive, without being surrounded by a team of enterprise programmers and all the boilerplate that seems to fall out of other languages.<p>I make my living hacking SQL.  What I'm really looking for there is the ability to create a lambda on the fly for custom grouping (eg implementing a business rule dynamically).  I've worked on at least three big enterprise projects where I could have eliminated thousands, if not tens of thousands of LOC with a feature like that.  Maybe I should punt and roll with a Prolog engine in the Lisp of choice.  Who knows.<p>I really enjoy the articles and comments on these topics here on HN.  Keep 'em coming.",1258221419

941884,comment,941807,941807,0,0,pospischil,,,"I definitely like the concept.  My hang up is -- how is this different than mahalo answers?  (more focused, sure, but the mahalo folks could answer these questions, no?)  Doing something to verify the tutor's expertise might help with this (could be simple quizzes or something).<p>Another general note -- as a tutor, I'd like some assurance that I will get paid for answering the question.  This may lead to less questions, but significantly more answers.  This obviously introduces quite a bit of complexity for the poster, but I think its necessary.  You could potentially start people with a few pounds in their account that you finance to get things rolling (or, give people a few pounds when they sign up and add a credit card).<p>Next -- visual design -- I was impressed with your design, there are some nit-picky things to tweak, but overall it is visually appealing.
-In safari, the sign in/register links at the top have the descender part of the g gets cut off (probably because the containing div is too short).
-The font color in the ""Post My Question"", ""View All Questions"", ""Answer Question/Make Bid"", etc is a bit difficult to read.  This one nags at me quite a bit because it makes the buttons look pixelated or something -- i'd fix this up right away.
-Really like the visual representation of description of service -> ask a question call to action.  looks great/leads the eye the way you want it to!<p>As others mentioned -- the about us could use some copy.  Don't want to spend too much time on it, but it adds a lot of credibility (or rather, it takes a lot a way to see 1 line of text there).<p>I have to run here in a second, but one last thing -- you might want to think about requiring signup AFTER someone has answered the question (as you do with the asking of a question).  Once someone has spent time answering a question  they are more likely to sign up.<p>Wish I had some more time, but the site looks good, keep up the great work!<p>Good luck!",1258220673

I have a whole bunch of ideas based around all sorts of pain I've had setting up a small company, and I've built systems to alleviate much of this pain.

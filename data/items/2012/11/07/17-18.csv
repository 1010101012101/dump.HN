Its when the best thing I can do for them is to just get out of their way.""</i><p>I wish more ""real world"" managers believed in this principle.<p>Academics tend to want their students and post-docs to function independently.  They don't have the money to hire ""managers"" (a.k.a. ""people who boss other people around and don't contribute""), and therefore prize autonomy.  It's not universal, but it's common.  Even on large projects, there tend to be very few formal ""managers"" on a scientific team.  The research organization tends to be flat, and the leaders are the people who produce.<p>When I first left grad school, I assumed that this sort of autonomy would be a prized commodity in the real world, but instead I've found that most businesses have a natural revulsion to independence.  Politics, money and laziness conspire to produce a class of people who want mainly to exercise authority without doing much work.  These folks are easily threatened, resort to micro-management to control situations that they don't understand, and generally just try to get <i>in</i> the way of any progress that occurs without their consent.  It's a weird pathology of the commercial world, but I don't think I've ever encountered a professional manager who thought that his most effective role was ""getting out of the way"".",1352311053

4754356,comment,4750390,4752987,3,0,ajross,,,"Yeah, it really looks like this was built with essentially no view to binary compatibility (i.e. they did it on Precise simply because that's what they had on their desktops) and then tried to bolt-on multilib and cross-version (cross-distro was clearly chucked as far out the window as they could throw it) features right before beta.  Then they added a bunch of ""checking"" stuff to the scripts ""just to be sure"".<p>Broadly, the best way to do this looks like this:<p>0. Build on 10.04 Lucid.  Of the existing ""well-supported"" distro choices, it is binary compatible with more of the rest of the universe (including modern Fedora/OpenSUSE too!).<p>1. Identify dependencies on distro-provided software very early, and document them precisely.  Things like the ""xboxdrv"" hacks mentioned above shouldn't exist; if you can't get it everywhere you need your own copy.  It sucks but it's true.  Building this stuff from scratch really isn't rocket surgery.  A Lucid-built library <i>will</i> (absent missing dependencies) work on more modern distros, I promise.<p>1a. Conversely, if you <i>can</i> get something from the distro reliably, please do!<p>2. Separate the ""update"" mechanism from the binaries!  Running steam should simply run steam.  Put a ""there is a new version"" check in there if you must, but don't invoke the package manager on behalf of the user!  If there are dependencies missing, you shouldn't be running at all.<p>3. Maintain your own apt (and ideally yum/zypper) repos.  This allows you to cryptographically sign your distributed software in a way that the users and their tools already understand.  And frankly it's something you need, and aren't likely do (or do <i>correctly</i>) for yourself anyway.<p>Doing things like this ensures that those of us who aren't on your preferred distro can still run your software without hating you.  This is Linux -- you don't need to bend over backwards to support us.  We're happy to do some porting work, just don't crap on us like you're doing now.",1352310794

4754322,comment,4753364,4753364,1,0,clarkmoody,,,"What this article seems to show is that the election was not about political ideology. It was about getting out the vote. The Obama campaign fine-tuned its message to scientifically increase returns in those targeted groups. The Romney campaign played the 'smoke-filled room' game (for all we can tell).<p>In none of the presidential debates did either man speak in depth about his governing philosophy (or the Fed for that matter). Their talking points rang loud and clear over and over, and finger-pointing abounded, but neither spoke of his core convictions. The campaign speeches were much of the same. For all of the complaints about Romney's lack of details in his economic plan, the President didn't do any better, simply offering a 'stay the course' message (he learned <i>something</i> from Bush).<p>Therefore, given this article and the lack of ideology involved in the campaigns, I conclude that the voters were not persuaded by philosophy. They were targeted by the campaign so that the powers that be could keep their power.<p>Looking back to the electoral college results of 1980 and 1984 shows what a strong, clear ideological message can do. Those familiar with Reagan's speeches will know why.<p>So for those who say that America has embraced any certain ideology, I say that it has not, since ideology hasn't been on the ballot for a long time.

4754321,comment,4752208,4754032,1,0,pseut,,,"> In the coin flip scenario each throw of the biased coins are independent. How one lands does not effect the other. The same is likely not true for how states end-up voting.<p>For sure.  If I have a point, it's that there's not enough information in any election to claim that he ""nailed it.""  Since the outcome he said was most likely seems to have occurred, it definitely supports his model and his approach.  But you'd need to see a longer track record than exists to be sure.  (think of each coin flip as being a separate national election).<p>Independence is a little bit of a red herring, though.  There are LLNs and CLTs that allow for weak dependence between the observations, and any strong/systematic dependence between the states belongs in the model (and I think is in Silver's model, but I could be misremembering).  And we would expect that 6 of 10 ""60% Obama"" states would come up for Obama.  The interdependence is going to affect the variance but not the mean.  So we should expect to see (say) 8 or more of 10 going to Obama happen more frequently than a naive binomial(.6, 10) distribution would predict.",1352310392

Look at Greece.  That's where we are going.  Unless things change.  All of the above issues start to move under a different lens when you suddenly find yourself on the road to insolvent third-world-nation status.<p>I have lived in a country where distraught groups took to the streets, destroyed businesses and property, took over airports and blocked roads with big piles of burning tires.  Can't happen here?  I hope.  We are not that special.  People --mobs-- can become really irrational when economic opportunity isn't available.<p>That's why I said that the number one priority is to focus all of our efforts --every one of us-- on regaining our economic standing.  This effort had to start four years ago, not now.  We wasted four years and made the job exponentially harder.<p>I really hope that Obama focuses on what's important and doesn't waste our time.<p>On another post someone said that the country isn't going to be destroyed by another four years.  Of course not, if what that means is that we are not going to have our cities look like favelas in Brazil.  What will happen --and what, to a certain extent has already happened-- is that our country is being destroyed from the inside and outside in terms of economic and industrial capability.<p>I don't know where the tipping point is.  But this isn't a game you can keep playing forever.  I've done the math, and it's ugly.  Just fire-up your favorite spreadsheet and try to figure out what you have to do to pay off the national debt in, say, 25 years.  It is a sobering exercise because you realize how futile (and dumb) ideas like ""tax the rich"" really are.  The couple of models I've played with indicate that if, and only if, we get dead-serious about cutting our spending to the bone and having a balanced budget we can pay off the debt in about 50 years with some moderate restructuring of income taxes that will affect everyone, not just the ""rich"".<p>Think about that for a moment:  Fifty years.  Fifty.  That means living in near economic stagnation for a very long time while you pay off your debts and achieve balance.  Even if the goal was to cut the national debt in half, it'd still take 25 to 30 years.  In other words, under nearly all scenarios you, I and the next generation will be saddled with this problem.<p>I care about social issues.  Of course I do.  I also care about having a good environment within which to address them.  That's why I say that nothing, absolutely nothing today has a higher priority than getting us back to a strong economic standing.  If we don't focus on that we are fucked.  We are on a slippery slope.  And we are accelerating down that slope.  Stopping becomes exponentially harder as we focus on solving the wrong problems.<p>This is basic in business:  You have to have a solid balance sheet before you can engage in R&D and grow.  If your business is constantly bleeding money you, all of a sudden, find yourself in a situation where you just can't innovate, compete and grow.  A solid balance sheet allows you to do nice things for your employees and your community.  You can engage in philanthropy and buy everyone pizza on Fridays.  If you are up to your eyeballs in debt and bleeding money you are not going to be donating time and money to your local community and your employees better pack their own lunch.  Basic.",1352309476

Say I give you the choice of two candy bars: one costs you $1.00, the other costs you $0.75 and also costs some random third party $0.75. Which do you pick? The latter, of course. Everyone always picks the latter, and the end result is economically inefficient.<p>This is the same choice when it comes to energy. A Harvard study found that the externalized costs of coal range from $350-500 billion: <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/16/us-usa-coal-study-idUSTRE71F4X820110216"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/16/us-usa-coal-study-...</a>. Fully half the true cost of coal power is externalized to people outside the transaction of power producers/power users. The market doesn't yield efficient results when costs can be externalized like this. That's Econ 101 level knowledge. There are only two ways to fix this market failure: either tax coal power to reflect the externalized costs, or subsidize green tech to compensate. In our political system new taxes are pretty much impossible, hence we adopt the latter solution.",1352309442

When a professor at the places I've been hires a research assistant on grant money, the grant account is charged stipend + tuition (plus overhead, but that's usually already been taken out up front). It might be a reduced tuition, e.g. at state universities it's common to give an out-of-state tuition waiver so the grant is only charged the in-state graduate tuition rate, even for out-of-state students. But that's often still in the $10-20k range.<p>If the student isn't grant-funded, then yes, the prof isn't expected to pay them anything: the department will cover their tuition, and they'll work as a TA to earn their stipend. But at R1 universities it's nowadays expected that profs will fund at least a substantial proportion of their PhD students each year on RAships paid out of grant money.<p>The difference is not always obvious from the student perspective, though: when departments say they guarantee funding for 3 years, they just mean that <i>somehow</i> the student will be funded each year, not that the department will pick up the funding each year. The goal is to get the profs to pay for as much as possible out of grants, with departmental internal funding as a backstop.",1352308376

4754126,comment,4749603,4752403,1,0,robomartin,,,"> Bill Clinton presided over the largest economic expansion since World War II; he was a lawyer just like Obama, would you have hired him to run your startup?<p>I've seen this used over and over again.  The economic expansion you refer to was fueled by what was happening with the Internet.  Clinton had nothing to do with that.  He just happened to be there while it was happening.  Some folks choose to ignore the facts and attribute the economic expansion to his administration.<p>The economic expansion that took place during his administration was the consequence of series of events spanning a couple of decades before he even ran for office.<p>If we are going to play that game you might as well attribute the 9/11 attacks in NYC to Clinton.  In other words, if we are going to credit a president with everything that happens during their administration you can't pick the good and ignore the bad.  He had a chance to get Bin Laden and did not.  The plans and training of the dozens of terrorists who conducted the attack happened under his watch, right here, in our soil.  In eight years he failed to re-shape our security services in order to make them more effective at dealing with terrorism on our soil.  Was he responsible?  Who, then?  Don't say Bush.  The attack happened during his watch, but all the preparation and training --right under our noses-- happened under Clinton's watch.<p>My point is that it is important to get past a partisan defend-your-team-no-matter-what attitude and make an effort to understand the underlying facts.  Of course Clinton was not responsible for the 9/11 attacks, just like he can't take credit for the economic expansion.  Events like these are often the result of decades of interrelated issues that, ultimately, trigger them.<p>It's like the infamous ""overnight success"" entrepreneur.  From the perspective of his or her neighbors they made it big overnight.  The reality, though, is often very, very different involving hard work, insight, sacrifice, failures and often years of investment and dedication.  Nobody sees that.  Nobody tries to understand that.  All people see is a new car in the driveway.  They choose not to think and reach inaccurate conclusions.<p>To get back to 9/11 briefly, it was probably the result of maybe fifty years of making questionable foreign relations and internal decisions.  Possibly even longer than that.  Hard to say.  If you want to blame anyone I think we need to blame the process, not the people involved.",1352308114

Secondly they have interest in maintaining the story anti-seminitism because it validates their narrative and could potentially help their relatives immigrate to the US.<p>Additionally many stories of anti-semitism that I heard were something a non-jew would experience as well but attributed to anti-semitism.

282929,comment,282234,282784,0,0,stcredzero,,,"The fundamental right to privacy is actually based on the right to personal safety, or the right to protect yourself from the mob.  In any particular context, an individual may well have the need to hide something.  For example, one might happen to be gay and alone on a bus with 7 violent homophobes.  This is an extreme case, but history is rife with examples where even the ""society at large"" context was manifestly unjust.  (Our own towards homosexuals, for example.  Last night, I was hired as a musician for a Baptist singles ministry group.  I thought it was prudent that I kept conversation away from certain topics.)<p>Saying that there's no right to privacy implies that all contexts are benevolent and just.  But we know that the world is not always just, so there must be a right to privacy.",1219341067

282921,comment,282905,282905,0,0,startingup,,,"The cost/benefit of giving up equity or taking VC funding is highly personal, situational decision. The correct answer is ""It depends"".<p>The folks that YC funds, by and large, have no business experience at all, so it is likely well worth it for them. But you can ""go to school"" (the school of hard knocks, that is) to learn those things YC brings too. That learning process takes time - time you may not have.<p>Ironically, in a serious downturn you turn out to have plenty of time. Companies like Flickr came out in a fairly relaxed time - nothing much was happening anyway. They actually took their time (Flickr was a side project of a site they called Game Never Ending which was on for a long time ...)<p>By comparison, we are now in a relatively frenzied times, and success is necessarily harder to achieve, so every bit of assistance you can get may be worth it.<p>To visualize the kind of ""no body cares"" times, look at the business of starting a classy restaurant right about now (with restaurant chains all around folding).

It's kind of a mess for writing elaborate custom rules, for the same reason that python is a poor command line tool integration language when compared with the shell (of which make is, essentially, a superset).  The same is true for cmake, or the GNU autotools, or ant, etc...<p>I happen to like make.  It's true that as a programming language it's pretty weak.

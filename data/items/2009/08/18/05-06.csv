You intentionally chose to implement it in a scenario that discarded any previous results.  The most common usage is for (std::list<x>::iterator it = list.begin(); it != list.end(); it++);  Using your naive approach, of course the list is going to be slow to access each element.  Keeping a single pointer in memory is much more efficient than spending clock cycles going back over elements you've already seen.<p>If you need the random access, or 32 bits is excessive to keep in memory (for whatever reason), a deque exists specifically for the purpose.",1250575193

Since establishing its dominance in, let's say 1997 or so, few features have come along that have truly changed the way that users word process (the last one for me was JIT spell checking).  But MS has been adding more and more features in an attempt to continue innovating.<p>There's a Word monoculture and there's innovation of a sort.  I think the interesting point that you make is that it's unfocused innovation that seems to be either incremental or aimed at preempting possible minor complaints, rather than exploring new ways for users to create documents.  Not that I'm critiquing MS specifically of this—I think this may be a general symptom of monopoly (and I wonder if the same would hold for Apple).",1250575052

No black swans involved.""</i><p>Yes, but what was not blatant was that the housing bubble popping would kill Lehman Brothers, cause runs on banks and almost bring down the whole world economy.<p>Taleb's point is that you can't go around behaving like any system is, to borrow a phrase ""too big to fail"" - or rather too cleverly thought out/regulated to fail. To some extent this is simple engineering. I can test the resilience of my cluster to network failure by pulling out an ethernet cable and see what happens - maybe there's a small hiccup while systems fall back onto local resources, maybe nothing fails over properly and I am hosed for 12 hours. As I understand Taleb, his argument is that the economic powers (bankers, traders, politicans) spend too much time trying to figure out how to prevent network failure, rather than making sure that when the network does go out, it doesn't take your whole mission down with it. Because, no matter how well you think you have engineered the system, the chance of your network going out somehow, sometime is non-zero.<p>I do agree with the posters that Taleb overstates the cleverness of his own insight; but unfortunately, in his field, it seems that people really were too dumb/greedy to grasp this. Irrespective of what you think of his interpretation of events or the validity of his suggestions (and I too question them), I think as systems engineers we can appreciate the risk of designing political and economic systems under the assumption that they can't fail.",1250574502

His point is, to put it more mathematically, that using inappropriate statistical models to try to model future events can lead to catastrophe. In particular, assuming something is a normal Gaussian process when in fact it's something that's <i>almost</i> a normal Gaussian but has a slight propensity towards total disasters that occur more often (and much stronger) than the Gaussian distribution would imply can result in you creating a system that is terribly brittle when those ""black swans"" occur.<p>""Scientifically"" applying the Gaussian distribution or  other advanced mathematical constructs when they manifestly <i>do not apply</i> is the real quackery, if Taleb is right.

NY is a much bigger city than SF and bad stuff happens even in the nicest neighborhoods.<p>Here's an illuminating map: <a href=""http://projects.nytimes.com/crime/homicides/map"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projects.nytimes.com/crime/homicides/map</a>",1250572003

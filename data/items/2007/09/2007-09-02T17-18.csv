There is no reason to declare you have them before there is a threat from another nation.<p>I see little reason why another country would be bothered with the enterprise before it gained momentum and wealth. <p>A reason to avoid nuclear power is to avoid getting attention. Avoiding oil deposits is another way to avoid attention.",1188755055
49462,comment,49239,49239,0,0,tipjoy,,,"The conventional wisdom is that no one reads help (online or otherwise). I'm wondering, would people read a manual if it looked more like this one? Have manuals gone out of fashion, and perhaps come back in style again... or are they something which never worked and never will?<p>Another interesting issue around help -- people often think that if something is really well designed, users won't ever need to get help.  That's true for the most part, however there are important exceptions.  When your product enables users to do something which they've never been able to do before, you can't expect that they won't need some help understanding what it is.  Groundbreaking stuff will probably require some explanation.  The original mac is a good example.",1188754912

I guess if I were doing this I'd use memcached and then I'd write to a shared file system somewhere for the writes.<p>We use Pylons and SQLAlchemy/Elixir/PostgreSQL though and we're very pleased.",1188754010

Almost everyone is at least familiar with mediawiki's reading interface (if not basic editing) because of wikipedia, so if you're starting a wiki that is going to have any appreciable amount of users, mediawiki is almost a no-brainer.",1188752569

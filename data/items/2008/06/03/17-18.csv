208151,comment,207942,207942,0,0,Hoff,,,"For transactional file systems and transactional databases, the lower-level software deals with this for you.  This whether a transactional SQL, or Mac OS X Core Data and its undo, or otherwise.  ACID is goodness.<p>For non-transactional databases (and non-transactional file systems in general), look at the concept of ""careful writes"".  At its simplest, you seek to allocate and work and read and write structures outside of the live application data structures and only add your structures into the static storage with a single-block or other canonical write as the last step of the update or change.  To always avoid having inconsistent structures.<p>In the event of an application or system crash, you can (will?) need a clean-up daemon that finds and releases any dangling allocations.<p>And one that threw me: there are cases where multiblock writes might not see all blocks written.  Some storage devices might either cache the data, or might (due to a power failure) not write all blocks.<p>You'll find various discussions and papers on ""careful writes"" around.  And ACID.  And related.<p>Once you get the hang of this sequencing, the next level of complexity upwards here can involve distributed access and coordinating and sequencing write operations.  This can involve locking or queuing.",1212515906

208128,comment,207942,207942,0,0,ajross,,,"Generally, sane file metaphors try very hard <i>not</i> to change stuff in the middle of the file.  Try to keep with one ""record"" (which might be a bigger object than a single row in a database!) per file, and read/write them all in one swoop.  If you need indexes other than the one you get for free (the path name, of course), keep them in separate files and make sure your toolchain can rebuild them as needed.<p>The filesystem has looser rules about data loss than the database will by default, so unless you want to handle this yourself (which can be done), you should probably to turn on ""ordered data"" journalling in your filesystem (e.g. for ext3: ""mount -o data=ordered"").  Then you only need to be able to recover from a crash (or killing) of your own software, which is a problem you'll have to handle anyway.<p>The classic application for this sort of technique is a mail server.

208103,comment,208068,208068,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"It's been discussed ad nauseum, but here's a summary:<p>1. Investors like to talk in person.  They don't feel like the have the soul of a company until they've shook hands with the founders and had a few conversations.  There is an old truism that being within 30 minute drive of an investor is the best indicator of whether they will fund your company.<p>2. Nerds and entrepreneurs like to talk.  A lot.  While HN is a lovely way to talk, it's also pretty low bandwidth and it has high latency.  Talking to others is how you figure out your business, and in the rest of the world, talking about a startup ""wastes your time and annoys the pig"".<p>3. It's reasonably nice to live here, so a lot of smart people live here by choice.  You have to hire smart people eventually.  And not just nerds.  You need lawyers who know about startups and will work on retainer.  You need accountants who understand that you're an idiot about taxes and finance and need guidance.  Basically, the friction of doing business is lower in the valley (SF isn't really the center of this magical place, though it's gaining lately...the center of the action is Palo Alto and surrounding regions).<p>4. Stanford.  Stanford is designed to churn out technology startups.  It has a great MBA program and a great comp sci program, and it is extremely involved in startup culture.  I doubt any other university is as tuned to producing students who start startups as Stanford is.<p>There's probably other stuff, but I think those are the biggies...and the ones that can't be easily replicated by mere talent or ambition or stubbornness.  Luck might do it.  But realize that even lucky companies (like Boston-based and YC-backed Tsumobi) end up coming to the valley to get funded.  Despite being in Boston, the second largest ""startup hub"", for a year since WFP07, they didn't get further funding until they came out to the valley to stay for a month...and Ron Conway spotted the raw intelligence they bring to the table.<p>The benefits of the valley are obvious after you spend some time here.

Maybe I'm used to the cellphone model of obscene rates after the cap.<p>In any case, I'm glad I live in an area with decent ISP competition. If I was charged like this I would switch in a heartbeat.",1212512472

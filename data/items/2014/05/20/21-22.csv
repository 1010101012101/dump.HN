7775450,comment,7775173,7775173,7,0,GuiA,,,"I consume marijuana regularly and enjoy it. Of course living in California, it is very easy to find, relatively cheap (I spend way less on weed every month than what most of my friends spend on Starbucks), and legal.<p>I had never tried it before moving to California (I come from a European country that vilifies all these things, and until I was an adult I thought it was some weird evil substance that turned anyone who tried it into a zombie), and then realized that I enjoyed the experience. If I were in a country where it is illegal, I&#x27;d be fine, but I&#x27;d definitely miss it (the same way I&#x27;d miss tea or chocolate).<p>Additionally, I have anxiety/depression/social issues that are greatly helped by THC. For example, I am extremely introverted, and tend to live in my head/on my computer all the time. Smoking a bit opens me up and makes me very talkative, which has been very helpful in social situations/relationships many, many times. Besides making me very talkative and much more upbeat and excited than I usually am, friends have told me that my behavior is not noticeably different while influenced by marijuana (i.e., my ideas are still coherent, I can still reason logically and rigorously, etc.). These friends have always been very straightforward and honest with me, so I trust them to not sugarcoat things for me. (to reinforce this, some of my most upvoted comments on Hacker News were written while high!)<p>I relate a lot to this essay by Carl Sagan in which he describes his relationship with the substance: <a href=""http://marijuana-uses.com/mr-x/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marijuana-uses.com/mr-x/</a> . I find marijuana very helpful when doing certain kinds of intellectual or creative work. For instance, it&#x27;s not that helpful when learning new things, but it is very helpful when going over ideas and concepts that I am already familiar with. It is helpful in 2 main ways: 1) linking ideas together that I had not linked together before, and 2) visualizing things better (especially in mathematics/physics). Re-reading a book or paper that I have already read, while high, is almost always sure to yield new understanding or ideas for me. It has also happened that I&#x27;d struggle with a musical piece (eg. on the piano or guitar) and that it all &quot;crystallized&quot; once high. Maybe this phenomenon is similar to why some people can pronounce foreign languages better when drunk. I do retain the insights and advancements when sober, and take notes in a notebook (which are coherent and hold up to scrutiny the next day). The one disappointment has been with programming: at best I program as well high as I do sober, and at worst it does slow me down a bit, without making my code any better.<p>I have been meaning to make more &quot;formal&quot; experiments on myself while high vs sober, e.g. on learning tasks etc. (I did do various tasks on the Nintendo DS game &quot;Brain Training&quot;, and noticed no difference in my results while high vs while sober).<p>(I&#x27;m obviously always sober during work hours etc. - what I described above I only do on my free time, ie. weekends or evenings, while working on personal projects/research)<p>All in all, I think you get out of weed what you &quot;put into it&quot;. Smoking weed doesn&#x27;t turn burnouts into math geniuses, and vice versa. It needs to be an addition to your lifestyle rather than your whole lifestyle. I certainly don&#x27;t think marijuana is a magical substance that makes you smarter or anything. I do believe that it puts your brain in a state in which it usually is not, and that this can be constructive for reasoning (the same way that talking to someone you&#x27;ve never talked to before, or talking to yourself (see rubber ducking) can help reasoning). All that being said, it is obviously not the case for everyone. For example, my girlfriend does not experience all of what I just described - for her, smoking weed just makes her more relaxed and happy. I&#x27;m sure there are many, many variables at play; but I&#x27;d still encourage everyone to give it a few tries (the first few times being not representative of the experience in general because it&#x27;s all new to you) to see what it does for them.<p>Finally, I really like this essay by Sam Harris: <a href=""http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/drugs-and-the-meaning-of-life"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/drugs-and-the-meaning-of-...</a>",1400622396

The rails were purposefully ripped up, mostly at the behest of the tire/auto/oil lobby.<p>This is a popular explanation of the fate of the Pacific Electric system, but like anything in history, it seems there were a number of factors that led to it happening.<p>The original system was designed as a loss-leader by Henry Huntington for his business venture of real estate sales and land development (e.g. electrification). Access to downtown LA from these new suburban developments in a pre-automobile world made them attractive to new buyers. As automobiles became common, three things happened:<p>1. The need for such a system began to decline as more people could afford their own personal transportation. This led to a decline in ridership, and hence revenue.<p>2. Because much of the system was at-grade (street-level), the increase in automobile traffic directly impacted service of the streetcars, as they had to share the road with the new influx of cars. This made the system less attractive, further decreasing revenue.<p>3. This declining revenue stream led to the system being sold to the local government, who inherited the problems above. At the same time, the freeway system was being planned (which at one point envisioned train tracks running down the middle of the freeways!), and this proposed system plus promises of more flexible (and cheaper) service via automobile busses made the system even less attractive to maintain.<p>So yes, while the system was eventually sold to a group with ties to the oil/auto/tire industries, the local authorities were all too happy to get rid of the system. While today the debate continues over busses (cheaper) vs trains, the real issue IMO is control of the right of ways. IIRC, MTA held on to a few ROWs and was able to use them in the new system&#x27;s Expo line, among others.<p>EDIT: LA&#x27;s MTA still faces this issue of at-grade tracks being impacted by traffic. Because it is cheaper, it is used substantially in both the Blue and Expo lines, and I&#x27;ve heard some arguments that the Expo line isn&#x27;t much faster than driving because it has to deal with traffic+lights. From a purely financial point of view, some have argued that you get the most bang for your buck with lines like the Orange line: busses on private roadways, so you get the fleet cost of busses but the time benefits of traditional train tracks separated from traffic.",1400622029

When you say Levison&#x27;s system made claims it couldn&#x27;t possibly backup, do you mean that from a technical perspective, or from a legal perspective?   I assume you mean from a legal perspective; as his service was a central point at which all messages traveled, he had access to both the encrypted content as well as the decryption keys which the government could then obtain access to via legal means.   The advantage afforded by personal systems like PGP keys is obvious in that no third party is involved, but at the same time, PGP or anything else doesn&#x27;t do any better from a legal perspective - the government can coerce you to give up your encryption keys just the same, no?<p>edit: I think you explained this in your reply at <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7775232"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7775232</a>.  but still, if the idea is, &quot;you can&#x27;t claim that system X protects you, because the government can compel that system to give up its keys&quot;, that would appear to apply to any encryption system.   OpenPGP can&#x27;t make the claim, &quot;now you can send any message with absolutely zero chance of the government ever reading them!&quot;, one subpoena (edit again: search warrant) for your laptop and your passphrase (or a covertly installed snooping device) is all it takes.",1400621579

It&#x27;s true that I&#x27;m <i>more</i> on their side than the average HN reader, but I share <i>most</i> of HN&#x27;s perspective on the actual disclosures in the Snowden documents.<p>But that&#x27;s neither here nor there, because my issue in this case isn&#x27;t that Levison was on the wrong side of a controversy with DOJ.<p>My issue is that Levison never should have been running this particular service. Like many other short-sighted developers, Levison built a site that made expansive claims about its security capabilities which anyone familiar with the actual technology could see were preposterous.<p>The framing of the &quot;debate&quot;, such as it is, about Lavabit seems to take as a given that DOJ or NSA can compromise secure messaging services, and that our only reasonable response is outrage directed at the USG (or &quot;Five Eyes&quot; or whoever) in the hopes of effecting policy changes. No. It is more than possible to build services that thwart the kinds of orders Levison received. It&#x27;s not even difficult to do that. Levison could have built a service that would not have provided him the capability of furnishing the FBI with Snowden metadata.<p>Levison didn&#x27;t not build that system because that was hard to execute technically. I think he did it because it was hard to execute <i>as a business</i>. Users want communications tools that work like the ones they already have, and, in particular, they want tools that interoperate with Internet email. Like virtually everyone on HN, Levison probably understands that such a tool is virtually impossible to implement as a web application. But Levison also knows that building native applications is expensive, and getting users to install things is more expensive still.<p>So instead of building something that protected his users, he appears to have built something that didn&#x27;t, and then pretended that it did. He may have &quot;gotten away with it&quot; so long as the court orders he apparently quietly complied with didn&#x27;t pertain to the highest-profile target on the Internet. But once that happened, the game was up.<p>If all of that&#x27;s true, I&#x27;m not sure from where I&#x27;m supposed to find sympathy for people who play those kinds of games with people&#x27;s secrets.",1400620510

The bike lane on the famous Venice beach was actually where the rail used to be. One pic I saw showed the rail didn&#x27;t run to the beach at a perpendicular angle. The rail ran parallel to the beach for some distance.<p>Check this article:\n<a href=""http://www.travelmatters.org/about/los-angeles"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.travelmatters.org/about/los-angeles</a>\nIn 1920s, Los Angeles had the most extensive interurban railway system in the world, comprising 1,164 directional miles of track which, at its height, moved over 100 million passengers a year. In 1920s.<p>The rails however went into decline. No, not just decline. The rails were purposefully ripped up, mostly at the behest of the tire/auto/oil lobby. And the land that could&#x27;ve been kept around for possible use again as public transportation was paved over and forgotten.<p>Now it costs a billion just to build a few miles of subway that goes no where. Buying land is expensive due to real estate cost. Tunneling underground is expensive because of earthquake fears. And of course because it&#x27;s so expensive, the &#x27;rails&#x27; don&#x27;t actually get to go where they need to.<p>They are talking about building a rail extension to LAX (main airport at LA) but the rails probably will stop a few miles from airport and passengers will have to switch from rail to shuttle bus. Part of reason is building cost (not cheap real estate and soft underground soil near LAX) and another reason is taxi/shuttle lobbies. And don&#x27;t forget there&#x27;s not much rail in LA anyways.<p>It&#x27;s a madness.<p>Update: I know everybody hates LA but really nobody can beat LA. Who rips up 1000+ miles of perfectly good commuter rail line for no good reason? Nobody can beat LA in the field of short-sightedness.",1400620332

7775150,comment,7774198,7774198,2,0,brianshaler,,,"At a glance, it doesn&#x27;t seem like they&#x27;re doing anything panorama-specific. The input must already be a &quot;high resolution image&quot; (presumably stitched) and the output is simply a map tile viewer, with the input image sliced up into squares at different zoom levels. Their lack of panorama support shouldn&#x27;t be a huge issue in the majority of cases, as long as the images are cropped vertically. If you want to capture and share panoramas, there are pretty good options like Occipital&#x27;s 360.io or Google&#x27;s Google+-only Photo Sphere. Not sure if there are any great options for sharing high-resolution panoramas, but maybe PanoPanda could grow into that?",1400619670

The government effectively killed his business the second they first coerced him into undermining his clients. The only choice for him in that position was to give up on his business or give up on his principles. If he indeed wound up failing on both counts, well, at the point someone is put under this sort of duress, is there any point in being so judgemental of him?",1400619664

6244967,comment,6244800,6244800,1,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> Side projects are not necessarily a great way to get better at engineering, and by no means the only way to get better. If you take on a side project, you do go through the process of defining a product and coding it up, most likely full-stack and hopefully with some interesting technologies, but youre probably not going to be working with a lot of teammates on a large, complicated codebase with evolving and expanding product requirements and scaling it up and maintaining it over time, which ends up being a lot of what software engineering actually is.<p>Notwithstanding the fact that working &quot;with a lot of teammates on a large, complicated codebase with evolving and expanding product requirements and scaling it up and maintaining it over time&quot; is not necessarily what &quot;software engineering&quot; entails (or should entail) at <i>every</i> company, I actually think this is why a lot of developers take on side projects: being able to design and build something of one&#x27;s own using the technologies of one&#x27;s own choosing can be a lot more satisfying than refactoring code and putting out fires for 8+ hours every day.<p>Obviously, developers who are adequately stimulated and satisfied by their day jobs probably have less incentive to indulge in side projects, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, but most people in the industry know that engineering jobs, even at the hottest or most prestigious companies, often leave something to be desired.",1377017992

I think that this is the nuance of the article that the headline simplifies away. I think we often look for side-projects because they are an indicator of ongoing learning and they demonstrate expertise. They are by no means the <i>only</i> way to show these things to a prospective employer. Giving presentations, writing articles, being able to discuss industry trends intelligently... All of these things count too.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.quora.com/Software-Engineering/Are-you-a-bad-developer-if-you-dont-take-on-side-projects"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quora.com/Software-Engineering/Are-you-a-bad-dev...</a>",1377017959

We should consider it a pre-requisite that someone interested in swapping secure communications has at least one computing unit which they can control. This is like asking &quot;but if someone doesn&#x27;t have fingers, how will they type at a public computer?&quot; Most people have administrative access to at least one machine, at least a phone if not a laptop. The requirements to generate a key are not excessive.<p>>That&#x27;s where opening a &quot;throwaway&quot; email address and sending something unencrypted is a viable use case.<p>Never said this won&#x27;t ever be a viable use case. There are times when it&#x27;d be appropriate to use a one-time mail address from a public terminal and then discard it. It&#x27;s really up to the individual if encryption is necessary for the content they&#x27;re seeking to send.<p>>One would be wrong. If an adversary is keeping a copy of every file that is opened on a USB stick (which would be trivial to add as an &quot;update&quot;, &quot;patch&quot;, or &quot;option&quot; to, say, an on-demand antivirus scanner) then it&#x27;s game over.<p>So first, this is another level of complexity, another barrier, that makes things more difficult, even if it could plausibly be executed. A random joe who sneaks a hardware keylogger between the board and the machine will not be able to do anything with this. Many amateurs will fail to understand that this kind of thing is needed. It is still much more secure to use a public terminal with the knowledge that this may happen than putting all your eggs in one basket and relying solely on keyboard input (&quot;something you know&quot;) for security.<p>Secondly, if they&#x27;re copying EVERY file off every USB drive that&#x27;s plugged in, they may have difficulty distinguishing your key, especially if you take avoidance techniques as mentioned in my first post. Private keys that are used by GnuPG are binary, not plaintext (you can export them as armored keys, but GPG won&#x27;t use these files directly). You can name the keyfile whatever you want. You can embed your key inside another file and extract it to /tmp with dd. You can put your keyring in a TrueCrypt volume. You can put it in a password-protected rar file. You can encrypt it against a key that is embedded on the stick outside of the filesystem, so that even if the terminal copies the full contents of the filesystem, they still won&#x27;t be able to use your key. There are all kinds of things one can do to ensure that his key is not just sitting there to be taken, and to be reasonably secure that even if it is taken, it will be difficult to extract in a meaningful manner.<p>>If they have your key from the previous step then changing your passphrase does absolutely &quot;jack&quot; and &quot;shit&quot;<p>Yes, I&#x27;m aware of this, which is why I prefixed my statement with &quot;[a]s long as the private key is not automatically copied by the terminal...&quot;<p>> Where are you going to change this passphrase anyway that&#x27;s on a computer owned/trusted by you if you don&#x27;t own a computer or don&#x27;t want to tie that key back to your home machine and identity?<p>You&#x27;re not, you must have a machine you trust, as most people trying to leak content will. One could use a virtual machine to manage his identities that he didn&#x27;t want registered on the host box.<p>>Then you&#x27;ll have backdoored copies of GnuPG installed on these machines that will offer you no security.<p>This is a good point. You should use your own GPG binary hosted on your USB stick instead.",1377017698

If you want proof, compare the US handling of the Washington Post to the British handling of The Guardian. The Washington Post and New York times have been free to publish everything. The Guardian however, just had spooks smash their computers this past weekend.<p>The US affords the press freedom: freedom of speech, freedom of debate. There are no spooks here that are trying to shut anything down, anywhere. At worst, we have some secret conversation that happened between Lavabit&#x27;s owners and the FBI. No one forced anyone to shut anything down however, most certainly not in this Groklaw case.<p>Abuses that have come to light are all under-the-table sort of affairs. Metadata collection is not technically data, and therefore isn&#x27;t afforded 4th amendment protections. (See Smith v Maryland). Information gathered from the NSA technically can&#x27;t be used in a prosecution case, so the DEA unofficially changes the story before it gets told to a judge (see Parallel Construction).<p>Some laws are working, but there are cracks in the foundation which is leading to an overall breakdown in trust. If anything, viewing the news recently has shown me that these agencies are very interested in following the _letter_ of the law, although not necessarily the spirit of the law.<p>------------------------<p>History of the US is a sobering example, of the Government constantly giving up powers in favor of its citizens. Need I remind people of the Office of Censorship in 1940s, where Government agents read every single mail that was going across the mail system? Need I remind people of COINTELPRO in 1960s, the program the FBI used to spy on Malcom X and Martin Luther King Jr ?<p>The US Government has historically listened to the pressures of its citizenry, and changed.

They&#x27;re affordable. They haul people in relative comfort, they&#x27;re easy to get kids in and out of, they drive well, and they get pretty good MPG.<p>On reality, very few people actually want to own one.  Ergo, millions of Americans drive SUVs who would really be better off in minivans.  Which has led the industry to make lots of SUVs that try to offer the utility of a minivan, in a different form factor.<p>In doing so, they lose the &quot;Utility&quot; part of the SUV acronym, or at least lose its traditional meaning.  Out of the modern crop of SUVs, there are very few that could handle anything more arduous than a carefully grated dirt road. Which really, is fine, because how often does your average family-mobile need to ford a stream?<p>Discounting the awesome technology and innovation, that&#x27;s essentially what Tesla is trying to do with the Model X.

6244874,comment,6243946,6244459,20,0,jerf,,,"As with so many programming techniques, there is nothing that can <i>only</i> be done with a coroutine approach, so bear in mind that any example that fits in a little text box probably also fits into a little text box with conventional functions. Practical differences only appear at scale.<p>Further, &quot;coroutine&quot;, like so many other programming terms, has suffered from a certain fuzziness. There&#x27;s a reasonably precise term used by programming language researchers, which very few languages have. Things like Python&#x27;s generators do not conform entirely to this definition, but you get people calling them coroutines anyhow, along with so many other things.<p>So, rather than try to justify the exact PL-research definition, let me try to explain the interesting thing about the more sloppy, broad definition. In a nutshell:<p>When you call a function, you pass in certain arguments. Then you start at the beginning, generating state or values in response to the input, before finally returning some more values. You then discard all the intermediate state the function generated. The idea here is that there are times when you may want to <i>not</i> discard the state, and/or you may want to be able to <i>not</i> start the function at the beginning. You may also want to pass fresh values into the middle of the function.<p>One of the most clear examples of where this is useful is when you create a pipeline of functions within your code. Using &quot;functions&quot; that can get more input as they go along, and generate output without discarding all their intermediate state, makes it very easy to compose functions together into a pipeline that <i>only</i> know they are in a pipeline. You can take input from a user, apply a &quot;coroutine&quot; that then parses their input into numbers, feed that into a &quot;coroutine&quot; that groups them together into a run-length delimited format, then feed that into a coroutine that writes the results to a file. Each of these routines holds on to a little bit of state, instead of discarding it. Each of these routines is &quot;pluggable&quot;; you can take the same pipeline, pop the &quot;user input&quot; bit off the front, and read from a file, or stream from the network, and the same for all the little bits. You get a composable system of functions that all know just barely enough to function (which is what makes composition easy), instead of a set of functions that knows &quot;A ha, I&#x27;m going to get this sort of linked list, traverse it, do &#x27;my thing&#x27;, and then return a new sort of linked list&quot;, which doesn&#x27;t work on network streams, or hash tables, etc. This also is an easy way to operate on a &quot;stream&quot; without having to have the whole stream loaded into memory, and is more cache/memory-bandwidth friendly because you&#x27;re only traversing it once.<p>Of course, if you work at it enough, you can do this with conventional functions. But you&#x27;re going to write a lot of boilerplate, you&#x27;re going to get it wrong, and it probably still won&#x27;t be as composable in the end. Or you&#x27;ll end up manually re-implementing &quot;coroutine&quot;ish things yourself.<p>This is only one example, but it&#x27;s one of the clearer ones where having things able to retain state without being forced into the strict call hierarchy that conventional function stacks require is obviously a good idea.<p>(Pendant note: I&#x27;ve tried to keep this comment very language agnostic. There&#x27;s a world of difference between Haskell and Python here, for instance. I&#x27;m going for the essence of the pattern in general, not in a particular language.)",1377017282

There are only a few emails I&#x27;ve ever received that could possibly used against me by anyone, and even those aren&#x27;t really a big deal, yet I would still feel vaguely violated if I knew anyone was reading my email; and some of the things I&#x27;ve felt guiltiest about in my life were (small) violations of other people&#x27;s privacy, even though they did not harm them in any way.

Except with no centralized server for transmitting or storage. Instead store all communication logs and copies locally on the clients computer. Along with encryption certs unique to each persons computer. When generating your certs, you would generate with a specific person in mind, so that when you put in parameters for generating a new, unique key, the other person that you are wanting to communicate with can create a corresponding cert that will decrypt the message upon arrival.<p>One problem I have already is to have keys that reflect the ability for each persons client to read each persons emails. How do you share something you want to keep secret, to keep things secret, without exposing the keys to flaws.<p>Anyway, moving on, the actual trick I have come up with though is splitting. I want to send an email to person B, so I type it up, I hit a button that says &quot;prepare to send&quot; which sets into action a few steps. One, it fills the email with random crap that doesnt matter to make it larger. Two, it splits this new, larger email, into say, 20 smaller files, but in random splits that will have to be remerged once it has been received. Because it has been split into pieces, we will also want to send each piece through a different transit server before it hits its destination. In this way, even if the emails get caught in a dragnet, or are even targeted, they would have to be lucky enough to get all 20 pieces, know how to decrypt them, put them back together, and get rid of the BS that was filled into them. With them split and going in different ways before going to the same place, and the gov entity not knowing how many pieces there were, they wont even know how many they are looking for.<p>So<p>Message - process - FILL with random (Im thinking this is more like salting if im not mistaken).
Split into x number of emails
Send through multiple servers so not as easily obtained, tracked, or pieced together.

Bob<p>You take this and add characters all throughout the email, jumbling the sentences before the messages themselves are even encrypted by some other standard means. And before that standard method is used, the email has been shattered into many many emails of random number before you even wrap it up to be used for transit.<p>Sorry for the wall of text and probably repeating myself, but I am trying to be thorough in my explanation so as to prevent misunderstandings.

The site could simply put up a huge disclosure statement on a web form that THE NSA might get what you say. Or not accept tips except via public comments but still operate.<p>I dont think Groklaw claimed it dependes on anonymous tips. The Groklaw fair well did indicate that they valued the privacy of their communications however just as they value not having anyone riffle through their underwear drawer.<p>> 2)Most of the people Groklaw corresponds with don&#x27;t need anonymity either. Those that do presumably know it and hence, will not correspond with them absent secure means (once made aware of the need for them)<p>The need for anonymity was not claimed. No one siad lives or livelihoods were at direct risk. It was claimed that in general people act differently when they know they are being watched, recorded, or when it could be used against them in the future.<p>> 3) Groklaw isn&#x27;t an email service provider, it&#x27;s a legal blog/online magazine. As such, likely none of the NSA&#x27;s mechanisms for getting information from email providers apply. Compelling individuals to hand over their own correspondence is, as far as we know, hard. It can get worse with freedom of the press issues.<p>I would assume that all of the email in question is likely to go through a email service provider and the NSA&#x27;s normal mechanisms will work against that email provider. My understanding is that is  uncommon for the NSA to compel &quot;individuals to hand over their own correspondence&quot; and that is normally happens at the email provider level.<p>> So post a PGP key and say, if you really want anonymity, use this.(Edit) and use a mixnet or Pond, or something to send the message. PGP encrypted email from a new account just deals with the NSA&#x27;s email intercept capability. If you are worried about their other abilities, you need something stronger then Tor since it fails for global passive adversary.<p>What percentage of interested customers are lost when you add one more confirmation button in-between them and buying a product?

But are you implying there are no SEO benefits to posting popular content on Google+? Google does use PageRank and anchor text, 2 things present in Google+ posts that aren&#x27;t passed as easily in Facebook and Twitter. It seems to me that a popular post on Google+, shared and linked to by well known authorities, is just like earning a high authority editorial link - and this is a bit different than most other social media platforms.<p>Now, if you tell me you treat Google+ differently in a way that blocks link juice, blocks anchor text and doesn&#x27;t pass link equity, then I think I would have to rethink my thesis. Regardless, I think we&#x27;re both on the same page here. The goal is not to accumulate a massive amounts of +1&#x27;s (and I&#x27;ll amend my post to make that clear) but to share high quality content on Google+ and build your influence through this channel, and this can lead to real world success.<p>My argument is that Google+ as a platform passes actual SEO value, and I don&#x27;t think this is a bad thing or something that needs to be debunked.

Either way, it was pretty successful in its publicised goals, but also very successful in the less spoken about goals of US hegemony.<p>D&Y were overtly intended to make Germany dependent on the US, and the great depression pretty much directly precipitated the fall of the Weimar republic and the rise of National Socialism, as it absolutely buggered their economy and caused huge resentment.<p>Dawes of course got the Nobel Peace Prize, even though his work would ultimately set the stage for the bloodiest conflict the world has ever known.",1377015781

After that I played around a little bit with Python and Scheme. It never got too interesting since I wasen&#x27;t able to write any &quot;real&quot; programs. Later, when I was 15, I got invited to a private IRC network of cool and friendly programmers. One guy did a Haskell course and sent the slides from the lecture to me. I did some exercises with it and everything I didn&#x27;t understood I looked up in LYAH and RWH. After I was able to complete all exercises, which by the way was very simple ones, I started reading Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours. It told me how more about the practical use of monads, I learned how to use external libraries (Parsec in this case), and basically how you design a program from scratch. After that I tried to implement macros for it but failed, I wrote a simple IRC bot that used my Scheme implementation to evaluate expressions, I wrote a simple blog powered by Scotty and Blaze-HTML. Now I&#x27;m contributing to a recently released game engine which utilizes FRP, written some really small games with it and have contributed a little bit of code.<p>What I think made Haskell stick was that it was fun and easy to start write &quot;real&quot; programs with. :-)",1377015437

Giving the defenders the advantage, let&#x27;s round up to $1 billion.<p>So the NSA needs to spend $1 billion per year to counteract the top smartphone in the world.

(Jeez, I regularly get customers sending me traces of their customers (metadata+voice contents) just for troubleshooting purposes.)<p>Advances in massively deployed array microphones aside, I don&#x27;t find speaking in a park to be remotely similar to transmitting over a large public network. On the Internet, you are willing handing your data off to multiple third parties. You have little control over which third parties, or even which countries, your data flows through.<p>I&#x27;m not insulting anyone&#x27;s intelligence. I&#x27;m simply questioning why anyone assumes they&#x27;ve got privacy other than &quot;because it feels like it should&quot;. And, hey, that might be a good argument and something to get enshrined in law. (Although, I&#x27;d be surprised if the USG backs down at all, except perhaps to concede to some more oversight audits.)<p>Snowden&#x27;s &quot;hard evidence&quot; is great because it gives bigger, solid ammunition to argue against mass surveillance. But it&#x27;s not like anything has suddenly changed, nor should anyone&#x27;s behaviour change (other than to use encryption when possible).<p>P.S. Your comment would be better without the sarcasm.

This is quite a secure message and it would be as easy to send as any other email with mailpile or similar services. My point is that security is not a black&white concept.

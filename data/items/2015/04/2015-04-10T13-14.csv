9354293,comment,9352905,9352905,0,0,twic,,,"It&#x27;s no better in Java. A fairly literal translation of the code [1], using the new Random::doubles method [2], gets counts like so:<p><pre><code>  166808
  332743
  500449
</code></pre>
If anything, this is even weirder than the C++ results. :rage1:<p>The doubles method makes each value &quot;as if it&#x27;s the result of calling the following method with the origin and bound&#x27;:<p><pre><code>  double nextDouble(double origin, double bound) {
    double r = nextDouble();
    r = r * (bound - origin) + origin;
    if (r >= bound) // correct for rounding
      r = Math.nextDown(bound);
    return r;

I&#x27;d been looking at the 2nd gen Moto E or G for my parents, but the Xiaomi beats it, although at a higher cost.<p>It just amazes me how cheap tech has become. The other day I was looking through the Microsoft Store, saw a $90 ish tablet that had various discounts at times bringing it down to an absolutely ridiculous $60-70 range. I checked out some reviews and they were glowing (in terms of value), it actually runs windows 8 and comes with a year of Office 365 and an hour of Skype minutes every month. I can hardly imagine anyone buying Office 365 for a year at $70, instead of just buying this tablet instead haha. Of course it&#x27;s no Mac Pro, but it surprised me.<p>HP stream 7 was the name.

9354286,comment,9349723,9351437,0,0,jrochkind1,,,"Yeah, I like the way you describe the three qualities.<p>> I don&#x27;t think the problem is hopeless though. Usually when I see this, it&#x27;s either because the problem domain is just that complicated, or because the system is actually too flexible for the scope of the problem.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s _hopeless_, but I do think it is one of the intrinsic challenges in software engineering. That I think deserves more attention, including in training.<p>I think you are absolutely right about one of the main pitfalls being when &quot;the system is actually too flexible for the scope of the problem&quot; -- the trick is understanding the true scope of the problem, and how much flexibility is really required -- and it&#x27;s not usually really a &quot;how much&quot; question, but a question of flexible _where_ and _how_.<p>In open source software, it sometimes can mean saying &quot;No, we can&#x27;t make this flexible to your desires exactly, because those desires are outside of our principle goals, and we haven&#x27;t <i>yet</i> figured out how to accommodate them without ruining understandability.&quot;<p>Although sometimes you can find a clever way to introduce the right hook point to support that flexibility without turning your software into an over-engineered monstrosity... sometimes you can&#x27;t. Which is about the problem domain, about your understanding of the problem domain, <i>and</i> about your craftsmanship.<p>Another paradox or irony or tension is that &#x27;design patterns&#x27; are intended as discovered templates for flexibility with simplicity, but &#x27;design patterns&#x27; applied willy-nilly, cargo-cult, carelessly, without sufficient grasp of the true problem domain, or to excess -- result in lost understandability, and sometimes lost reusability and malleability too!<p>Many of us have a natural inclination to maximize flexibility always as an unalloyed good, instead of dealing with the inherent tension as constraint to catalyze good design.",1428674343

I knew I couldn&#x27;t undertake any drastic changes as they probably wouldn&#x27;t last so I decided on a couple small things that were attainable.<p>1) Decided to pay attention to what I ate.  Not necessarily to change what I was eating but just be aware and recognize I need to eat a little less.  This has meant not getting the second round at dinner and cutting out most of the snacks at night.<p>2) Wanted to exercise.  Again going from zero I knew I had to keep the bar low, so I decided on walking 25-30 minutes 3 times a week.  Also to tone my upper body I also began 5 sets of 20 push-ups twice a week.  These are mostly still on my knees but I&#x27;m getting better.<p>The result after 3 months have been great.  I&#x27;ve lost 18 pounds and have a much improved mental outlook.<p>Importantly I wanted to keep the expectations and changes small.  I can always ramp up later but going from zero I needed to make it easy to be successful.

Training to be strong improves every component of fitness: strength (duh), power, agility, balance, flexibility, endurance (all 3 types) and coordination.  I would also make the argument that in day to day life strength is the most important attribute of fitness  for someone in the western world.  The ability to carry a bunch of heavy bags of groceries, to rack a computer, help a loved one in an emergency etc., almost all depend primarily on strength.  It&#x27;s also the primary adaptation for injury prevention and rehab (knee and back especially).<p>People may have different fitness goals, but for someone who is untrained by far the best thing they can do is a strength program for 3-5 months before training more specifically for their goals.

So I think New York&#x27;s pensions are doing rather well in getting the managers to give up any of their outperformance.&quot;<p>The way this reads to me is that his idea of an actively managed fund should either match index performance after fees (in the case of a good manager) or perform worse after fees (in the case of a bad manager). In which case, you&#x27;d be better off sticking with index funds instead of betting on whether or not you have a good manager.<p>To put it into your example: The S&P 500 has returns of 5% for the year of 2020. Guy_A has his investments managed by Investor_Good who gets gross returns of 7%, but charges fees that leave Guy_A with 5% net returns (~1.87% management fee). Guy_B has his cousin Investor_Bad manage his scratch-off earnings who ends up matching the index with gross returns of 5%, but charges the same fee as Investor_Good leaving Guy_B with net returns of 3.04%.<p>Edit: I just wanted to add that this is how the how situation (not the NYC Pension, but the quoted section) sounds to me.

9354138,comment,9352901,9353194,0,0,acdha,,,"> You fogot to mention getting rid of teacher unions and starting evaluation of teacher performance<p>First, if you think that teacher performance isn&#x27;t evaluated, you&#x27;re simply too uninformed to be participating in this discussion. Not only is there constant testing, in many districts pay is heavily linked to it. For example, where I live in DC the performance bonus for an exceptional teacher is nearly half of their annual salary!<p>This has a number of problems: the most obvious being that there are many factors outside of the teacher&#x27;s control – poverty, attendance problems, untreated medical conditions, etc. – and the most damaging being the fact that you&#x27;re talking about small sample sizes which means that from one year to the next a teacher&#x27;s performance will “change” entirely due to the fact that last year they were randomly given better prepared/motivated students than this year. Cathy O&#x27;Neill was looking into these numbers for NYC and concluded that nearly 600 teachers a year are likely to be unfairly punished for random variations: <a href=""http://mathbabe.org/2015/04/03/how-many-nyc-are-arbitrarily-punished-by-the-vam-about-578-per-year/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathbabe.org/2015/04/03/how-many-nyc-are-arbitrarily-...</a><p>Moving on to the questions of unions, again you need to learn more about the field before evaluating anyone&#x27;s claims for how to fix it. Too commonly people on HN assume that teaching should work just like our high-demand, high-pay programming jobs and that mistake steers everything else badly astray.<p>Consider what happens in each scenario if you disagree with your boss, and ask yourself why there might be a stronger need for a union to protect workers’ rights in the second case:<p>Programmer in an at-will employment situation:
1. “We&#x27;re not doing this right” / “You&#x27;re fired”
2. Call a friend / actually reply to a recruiter
3. Interview tomorrow, start a new job in a week or two unless you decide to take a break<p>Teacher in an at-will employment situation:
1. “We&#x27;re not doing this right” / “You&#x27;re fired”
2. Since positions rarely open up during the school year, sit around for the next 6 months wondering how to pay your rent.
3. If you don&#x27;t work in a major city, your former employer is probably the only employer in the same county so you either need to move or your commute just became much longer. Hope you don&#x27;t have any family to make that complicated…
4. Be prepared to explain why you left, which is quite unusual and disruptive for the students, which is not your fault but will often be held against you.
5. If you do get an offer, remember that since turnover is low in good schools, unless you live an area with rapid population growth most of the positions which open any given year are probably going to be in the more stressful schools",1428672947

Why doesn&#x27;t NY just give me their money? Why aren&#x27;t I the greatest investor ever?<p>The answer is that my algo consists of watching the market and picking off liquidity from the top of the book (typically < 500 shares) when things get unbalanced. Then I passively (for the most part) close my positions a couple of weeks later, very rarely taking liquidity.<p>I made $2k last year on approx $10k in the market.

Not that I&#x27;d ever challenge the claim that Nimrod generally focuses on concision whereas Go is intended for environments in which such concision is generally discouraged and the two languages have perfectly predictable line counts on this sort of task after that, but the comparisons are definitely less meaningful than a first glance indicates for a lot of these.<p>For instance, see &quot;Box the Compass&quot;; codewise the two aren&#x27;t that different (Go is both slightly longer and appears to carry more information, it has more numbers in it for whatever reason), but the eye is initially misled by the fact that Go has a standardized formatting and the definition of a string array is rigidly required by the formatting rules to have one string per line, whereas Nim happily puts them on just a few lines. Neither is wrong, and, well, it goes back to that context I mentioned. Both languages have their reasons for that. Others, such as the matrix arithmetic, are pretty accurate...

I had a few scares during my wife&#x27;s pregnancy a few months ago and I remember waiting outside the emergency room and wandering what to do.  I didn&#x27;t believe in God or anything, I had nothing to comfort me or give me hope.  Then I realized &quot;I am not strong enough to be an atheist&quot;.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I didn&#x27;t overnight turn into a devout christian but I started doubting my doubts and my lack of faith and re-examining a few things.<p>Fast forward a couple of months and my twins were born and I wanted to baptize them.  A good friend of mine told me why bother if you don&#x27;t believe.  When we baptize in our church we have to raise our right hand, face the alter and accept the trinity.  I didn&#x27;t want to be a hypocrite and do that knowingly that I didn&#x27;t believe.  So I went and talked to the priest and told him how I felt.  I asked him to recommend books to help me &quot;convert back&quot;, help me believe.  Surprisingly, he told me &quot;what&#x27;s the point? anything you read, you will question, doubt and read with the intention to find holes&quot; so his only recommendation is to pray once a day and read one chapter from the new testament every day.  He told me I don&#x27;t have to understand or believe what I am reading but he told me to do it for a month and see what happens.  I am 2 weeks into it.  It&#x27;s hard.  I still don&#x27;t 100% believe.  But there is something changing.  I don&#x27;t know what it is but I will continue with this journey and see where it leads me.<p>On a side note, I read a fantastic book that answered a ton of my questions - it is called The Reason For God by Timothy Keller.  Very easy read and targets people like us - educated and secular with tons of doubt.<p>I know these are not solutions to your problems but maybe you will find comfort and hope in christianity.<p>PS: Please keep the &quot;religion hate&quot; speech to a minimum - I have heard it all - actually I have said it all :)",1428672120

Alas, the tone of the discourse often degrades to the lower levels of human interaction, when really there is an undercurrent to the discussion that is just as valid.<p>So finding fault in others, assigning blame - these are all just frustrated attempts to recognize that people do need to take responsibility for their lives, their actions.  Its hard for teachers to be blamed for the state of poor education when they&#x27;re not allowed to be responsible for it - when they have standards pushed upon them by fabian government kafka-lovin&#x27; &quot;employees&quot; who have never taught anyone a thing in their lives.<p>Alas, however, there is another factor here, and that is the poor need to be responsible for their lives.  They need to take control - however they can - and lift themselves up.  If it requires help, then so be it - but you can&#x27;t help someone who isn&#x27;t willing to help themselves, and thats the first step.  Calling for the poor to &#x27;accept the blame&#x27; is one thing; asking the poor to be more responsible for their lives, another thing entirely.  The same result is desired - its the degree of help, versus hostility, that makes the difference whether someone is willing to accept the claim, however.",1428671065

It&#x27;s already light and thin with awesome battery and great performance, they could have iterated on that (e.g. butterfly keys, layered batteries & no-click touchpad), give it a 170 PPI screen (1920 x 1200), thinning out the bezels, or add USB-C etc.<p>But instead they did something a bit too radical. Thin beyond necessity, a 480p camera while a 2012 ipod Touch had 720p/1080p, just a single port, and most importantly releasing a device that&#x27;s slower than an already existing, last year, &#x27;air&#x27; model.<p>But I do get it.

If for example instead of releasing the &#x27;air&#x27;, they iterated on the Macbook endlessly, we&#x27;d probably never have gotten the air.<p>> The most generous complaints are that &quot;it came out one year too early.&quot;<p>Pretty much. I can make that complaint about the Apple Watch (in 2 years an expensive Apple Watch will look dumb when a thinner device with smoother animations and longer battery life and better sensors come out), iMac 5k (thermal throttling?) etc. And that&#x27;s indeed fine, a complement in a way.<p>The new Macbook differs a little bit for me because it&#x27;s not a completely new technology like the Apple Watch, or a new Smartphone or Tablet. It wasn&#x27;t a question of &#x27;do this or do nothing&#x27;. It was a question of &#x27;handicap the Air and don&#x27;t make a big investment in the line and do a new less capable Macbook at $300-400 more&#x27;, or &#x27;make engineering investments to improve the air&#x27;. I think that&#x27;s a genuine consumer complaint one may have.<p>As a consumer I&#x27;m bummed they didn&#x27;t go with the latter. Would have really liked an Air with at least full hd, layered batteries, thinner bezels etc. Now my options are a premium netbook, or a MBP. I went with the rMBP.<p>As an &#x27;analyst&#x27; though, the rMB makes a ton of sense and if I were at the board of Apple I wouldn&#x27;t have rejected, rather, applauded the current path.",1428671047

I&#x27;ve found two broad solutions, which solve subtly different definitions of the problem:<p>1) Generate numbers that are uniformly distributed in the sense of, if you generated a bazillion of them and divided the range into buckets of even size, each bucket would have similar numbers of numbers in them.<p>2) Generate numbers that meet the above definition AND so that any particular floating number is no more likely to be picked than any other.<p>(The discrepancy being down to there being more representable floating point numbers in some ranges than others)<p>For my application, I don&#x27;t need to worry about #2, so I just generate an integer number uniformly across a given range (which is simple enough to do without bias), cast to float, and divide. It meets the definition of #1 unless the buckets chosen are very small.<p>I have seen a few people write solutions for #2 online, but haven&#x27;t seen any that have been sufficiently analysed and proven correct.",1428671036

9353970,comment,9349501,9352102,0,0,notacoward,,,"There are two things wrong with the &quot;nobody should use a distributed file system&quot; meme.  (Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a distributed file system developer.)<p>(1) Not all development is green-field and thus subject to using this week&#x27;s fashionable data store.  A lot of applications already use file systems and rely on their semantics.  Ripping up the entire storage layer of a large and complex application would be irresponsible, as it&#x27;s likely to create more problems than it solves.  Look down your nose at &quot;legacy code&quot; all you want, but those users exist and have money to give people who will help them solve their business problems.  Often the solutions are as cutting-edge as anything you&#x27;d find in more fashionable quarters, even if the facade is old fashioned.<p>(2) Even for green-field development, file systems are often a better fit than object stores.  Nested directories are more than just an organizational scheme, but also support security in a way that object stores don&#x27;t.  What&#x27;s the equivalent of SELinux for data stored in S3 or Swift?  There is none.  File system consistency/durability guarantees can be important, as can single-byte writes to the middle of a file, while parsing HTTP headers on every request drops a lot of functionality and performance on the floor.  Distributed databases are much more compelling, but the fact remains that the file system model is often the best one even for new applications.<p>Go ahead and use something else if it suits you.  Other people wouldn&#x27;t have much use for <i>your</i> favorite storage model, and this one suits them perfectly.",1428670936

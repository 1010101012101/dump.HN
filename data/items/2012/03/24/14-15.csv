The article I linked to talks about pixel density calculations, I'm sorry if this was too much effort but all the numbers are there for anyone that cares about the actual resolving power of the retina.</i><p>We don't care about the resolving power of the retina for some bizarro ""Heroes"" type people with super-sight, or in the abstract. We care that we can't distinguish individual pixels or nearly can't distinguish them. Which is the case.<p>That ""large part of the population""? Actually minuscule.<p><i>>Surely you're not going to suggest there are serious scientific sources that focus specifically on Apple screens? I thought actual research was what you made your initial comment about.</i><p>I didn't suggest such at the first place. What I wrote was that ""actual doctors and optical specialists"" agree that the claims are accurate. Plus, you don't need ""actual research on Apple screens"". If you know their DPI and the viewing distance, you can work it out from general research on the eye, and it will hold true for any other manufacturer too.<p>So, here's another actual expert (noticed the Ph.D and vision scientist parts?):<p>According to William H.A. Beaudot, Ph.D., a vision scientist who was a research associate at McGill University in Montreal and founder of KyberVision. “In my opinion, Apple’s claim is not just marketing, it is actually quite accurate based on a 20/20 visual acuity,” said Beaudot.\n(...) Dr. Soneira also claims in the Wired article that the term Retina Display is more of a marketing term and is “superamplified imaginary nonsense.” Beaudot doesn’t agree. “Since this display is able to provide a visual input to the retina with a spatial frequency up to 50 cycles per degree when viewed from a distance of 18-inches, it almost matches the retina resolution according to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem,” said Beaudot. “As such, Apple new display device can be called without dispute a Retina Display. Could it get better? Sure, but so far this is the closest thing ever done in display technology for the consumer market that matches the human retina resolution.”<p>Plus, as a tech geek, shouldn't you be jumping with joy that we have achieved widespread adoption of such high DPI screens, instead of arguing for minor details on their naming, and if they match the retina perfectly or just 20/20 vision etc?",1332601138

First of all, I don't think it's true that the teaching programs are particularly scraping the barrel (I'd pin that on some other programs, like business and criminal justice), and if it's truly ""consistent"" I'd love to see a cite.  My suspicion is that the average intellectual quality of ed majors is about in line with the average student in general.<p>Second, even if that subgroup average were lower than the middle of the general curve, your statement implicates <i>all</i> teachers as bad, and comments like this contribute to undermining the classroom authority of <i>all</i> of them.  I have no problem with calling out incompetence where it may be found, and there most certainly are individual incompetent teachers out there---we've all had a few.  But if we paint all teachers as the ""dregs"" of academia, we make the job harder for the many competent and the several outstanding teachers that are also out there.",1332600868

In particular, your claim only has a chance of being true if the students are actually interested in scoring as high as they can on the exam.  Even at the AP level (I teach at university level and interact with secondary teachers that teach smart, high-level students taking CS), there are students who have decided that they don't care about the subject, or maybe even like the subject but have no (perceived) benefit from a high score due to their chosen college not giving credit in that subject or whatever.  Such students may leave their answer book blank, or doodle in it, or maybe just blast through for the easy points and finish early and not worry about thinking about it.<p>This isn't even necessarily a particularly irrational choice on their part!<p>But it's a strong argument why the exams shouldn't be used to evaluate the teacher or the school.  In a lot of places the students aren't permitted to opt out of the exam, even if they don't care about it, but there's no penalty to the student for taking a dive on it (and any penalty you could try to assess would have false positives and false negatives and still not motivate many of the students with differently-aligned incentives).<p>All of these problems are going to be a million times worse on a general-education primary- or secondary-level assessment than they are on AP exams.",1332600018

Add static types, get rid of functions, and one class per file, and you almost have Java.<p>In ActionScript everything is an Java-like object.

If a Java gal went to AS she'd, optionally, want to incorporate closures as a tool.<p>You can approach Python lot like you would JavaScript -- some functions, some classes, passing around functions/classes as arguments, closures, etc. (I bet that I could replace my JS with Python pretty easily if browsers supported it). If a Python guy goes to AS all he'd really have to do is add types, put every class in its own file, and drop functions (in a few cases).<p>I wouldnt necessarily say that it meshes the two together, but I do feel that anyone who is comfortable with either Java or Python could be very productive with Actionscript in a short time because of how tightly loose it is, lol.",1332599597

There was also mention of ""competing with Tumblr"".. its a closed beta with 6 users.. the hype machine needs to calm down.<p>The second point is everything dcurtis has been working on being completely ripped off in a couple of hours is almost completely ignored.

3749394,comment,3744841,3748853,2,0,Retric,,,"Perhaps if I reword that a little you might understand what I mean: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness</a> is the subjective experience of the ability to think about things and processes as abstractions.  Apple, Airplane, Alphabet, Algebra, Balance, Self, or Obama they all exist as arrangements and connections of neurons in your brain.  When a song is stuck in your head that's a physical thing that's happening to a some neurons in your head.  But, so is everything else your thinking about.<p>These networks also connect to and build off of other abstractions so ((((peanut) + butter) + Jelly) + Sandwich) is built from more than one of these networks.  Try and think of a pile of peanut butter next to some grape jelly.  No problem it's brown next to purple.<p>Now try and do that for peanut butter next to a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Most people feel something odd happen on the second one because they are reusing the peanut butter network for both of those.  For me, I can't focus on their colors at the same time.<p>For a great subjective description of this watch: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cj4y0EUlU-Y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cj4y0EUlU-Y</a><p>Getting back to Consciousness, it's turning on these abstractions by choice.  I want to think about Apple so I activate the Apple network and suddenly experience Apple.  And it's the same network as if I had just read the word or saw a physical Apple.  Language also get's mapped to this which is part of why philosophers think about thinks like platonic ideals yes there is an ideal Chair it exists and it's the Chair classifier in your head.",1332598017
3749393,comment,3749067,3749356,2,0,raganwald,,,"I agree with what you've said here. I actually use ST to illustrate the relationship between patterns and languages. ""Fluent Interface"" is the name of a pattern wherein methods that are executed for their side-effects return the receiver, and callers then chain methods to a single receiver. This encourages writing many small methods while keeping code clear.<p>It is not necessary in ST, because ST's syntax includes the semicolon operator for cascading messages to a single receiver. In effect, the pattern is ""baked into the language.""",1332598009

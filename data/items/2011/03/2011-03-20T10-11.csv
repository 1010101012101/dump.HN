Browsing to a company's page shows you the latest hires.<p>I also use it as a research tool if there's someone in the hierarchy I want to get in front of. As a bonus they'll often maintain a public profile describing themselves, detailing their past experience and possibly linking to their Twitter account.

The company now makes enough money to support myself entirely.<p>The business was borne out of desperation. I needed to make money quickly so I spent a weekend thinking about:
1) What other people were doing online that made money;
2) Where my unique set of skills and experiences would give me a competitive advantage;
3) Whether I could build the business and start making sales without the need for cash upfront (I had none);<p>I settled on selling law revision notes to those studying UK law (www.oxbridgenotes.co.uk). Having studied UK law I could easily spot high quality revision notes. I knew my market. I knew what law students wanted and what their concerns were. I knew exactly what terms they type in Google when faced with a difficult essay. These were my competitive advantages.<p>The ""make money"" aspect is very important. Too many startups I see around me (I'm in Ireland) come up with a ""great idea"" which ultimately never makes a penny. Don't be one of those people. Ask yourself ""what can I do that could __make__ __money__ within two months"" and you will be off to a good start.<p>You said you've started a few good projects. I suggest that once you find a project that makes money (assuming you haven't already) you should drop the other projects and focus all your energies. You can always return to the other projects once you're rich.<p>-- Jack Kinsella",1300616861

If anything, apple looks at what people come up with 'off the ranch' and pulls it into their own stuff if they like it. Apple may have this 'reputation,' but it's purely because the press wants to have it painted this way. I'm no fanboy or anything, I've had a business crushed at their hands; as an engineer and a business guy, I find their decisions to be relatively rational and I was well aware of what was coming well before it was delivered.<p>People like to point to the guy on top as big and evil.

So, whatever Groupon does around the world, they can be beaten in one city at a time.

I work as hard as I can on the project at hand and (usually) know when it's time to take a break, but the focus remains on the project, not the break. If I cared more about snowboarding, for example, than my startup, I'd be a lot better at snowboarding but I can guarantee the company wouldn't exist.<p>In my mind startups are all about short bursts of intense and admittedly unsustainable bursts of energy. That's why it's a startup with an end goal in sight, not an established company that intends to continue forever. It may make sense for 37signals to fire the workaholics, but I don't think it does for me.",1204977133

Blueprint gets the basics very right indeed, and allows your readers to become productive quickly. Then you can  move on to how to create your own page elements, how to modify Blueprint, etc.<p>WRT your question, when I was building my own tiny websites I couldn't understand how CSS would help me be productive. The larger the sites, of course, the more obvious that became.",1204976578

131907,comment,131619,131619,0,0,m0nty,,,"www.novacaster.com is a CMS I coded from scratch in Perl, in 1999-2000. I was told by my boss it would be released as open source, but that never happened. When I left the job, he told me he would be ""retaining full rights to the Novacaster CMS code"", etc, and there was basically nothing I could do about it. I'd recommend getting a lawyer involved, although even that means nothing if you don't have the funds to fight a court case.<p>More recently, my strategy has been to say nothing to employers about side projects. Assign the rights to your friends, if you have to, just in case they do find out.",1204976336

I was in the lab for a class that was taught in Java for data structures (and C when the memory management talk started).  We were 5 weeks into a 10 week class.  The guy programming to my left turned to me and asked me what ""double equals"" (as in ==) meant.  I was stunned, but then answered.  Later it struck me: how the hell did this guy get through the metacircular evaluator in the first semester?  How had he gotten through the previous 5 weeks of assignments?  I think about it even now and wonder.",1204974560

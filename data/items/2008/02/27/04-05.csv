For instance you'd type in ""make fantasy sports site"" and have one working in seconds. Or ""clone Google"".<p>I'm going to put the project on elance, since I obviously have no experience writing programming languages. How much do you want to bet some Indian firm says they can program it for $1,200 in 2 weeks?",1204088370

124521,comment,124460,124460,0,0,wallflower,,,"Remember, doing all this I-am-startup-man-stuff is very much possible when you are healthy. If you start to feel even the slightest bit sick, most if not all of it goes out the window. Feeling you are getting sick is a red flag from you that one or more variables (nutrition, stress level, amount of sleep, exercise, workload, social life) is out of whack. Better, focus on balancing your life so you don't get sick (eat right, exercise, take a break and go out with friends).",1204087209

Usually I leave the last 20% for stuff that may actually be rather easy, but just isn't within my expertise or I'm not qualified to do. For example, I may save polishing the design, graphics, copywriting, publicity, and legal for the end since I can just contract most of that out anyway.",1204086788

It struck me as clever, attractive, provoking.<p>Then it turned into a glossy catalog of pricey cars and cognacs, with articles tossed in to fill some space.<p>I haven't really looked at an issue in a while.

124513,comment,124469,124507,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Yeah, if you could drive two monitors PLUS the internal monitor I would get the Macbook Pro religion, pronto. But I'm pretty sure you can't. You've got two displays, but one of them is the Macbook Pro's built-in display.<p>This is one reason why people bother with that big-ass 30"" display. The other is that, admittedly, the 30"" display is one nice piece of hardware. But pricey.<p>As it is I plan to buy an iMac, plant it in the center of the desk, and use my monitor arms to put my secondary display to the left and my Macbook to the right. Then I have two computers and three displays. Use Synergy to share mouse and keyboard between the two computers -- I've done that between Mac and Linux before, and I presume it will work from Mac to Mac.",1204086255

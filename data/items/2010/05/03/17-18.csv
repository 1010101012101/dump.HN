The screen is slightly larger than a post-it note, and the best comparison I can come up with is of reading a book on an Etch-a-Sketch.<p>I have read a ton of Project Gutenberg books on the iPad already, and it is fabulous. The screen does wash out in direct sunlight, but it’s still very readable—I took it to the beach in Hawaii last week a ton and read it for hours. Beyond the beach I can’t imagine anywhere I would ever read something in direct sunlight during the course of my normal life—it’s an enormous edge case for me. Ironically, I’m unable to read a real book at the beach in direct sunlight, because too much light reflects off the page and I can’t stare at it.<p>And I don’t agree that it’s not as nice as reading off paper or e-ink. Everyone mentions eyestrain but my eyes have never felt ‘strained’, even after reading for six hours. I guess different strokes for different folks, but I don’t think the Kindle and iPad are any comparison. It’s like comparing a calculator and a laptop.",1272909526

1315445,comment,1314572,1315359,0,0,cheald,,,"To put it even more starkly, if Apple were to revise the API, then the middleware pushes an update, and all those hundreds or thousand of app developers simply recompile with the new OS target. All of their apps are now feature-compatible with Shiny New Feature X, rather than those hundreds or thousands of developers all having to replicate the same work. This is Frameworks 101.<p>The entire point of an abstraction layer is to isolate a developer away from the underlying systems, to let him write more business logic and less systems support code. All modern software development is built on the concept of frameworks, layers of abstraction, and the like. Even Objective C itself is an abstraction away from the ARM11 instruction set on the iPhone's CPU. Do developers writing Objective C produce inherently inferior apps to those writing ARM11 assembly?<p>Frameworks reduce the total number of man-hours required to produce and maintain software. I will argue that a good framework produces <i>more</i> high quality software than a bunch of developers all rolling apps on the metal, which then have a longer lifetime, due to the fact that fewer developer hours are required per app to maintain it moving forward. (Please note that I am not making any kind of judgment here about whether or not CS5 constitutes a ""good framework"".)<p>It takes some pretty serious denial to see Jobs' case against middleware, cross-compilers, and abstraction layers as anything but an attempt to lock developers solely into the Apple ecosystem. Frameworks reduce developer hours in more than one way - they reduce the number of hours required to put your app on multiple platforms. (To put it another way, this is why we have 3D engines like Unreal and Crytek; it's why we have 3D API layers like OpenGL and DirectX. You can write a game without them, but you'll spend thousands of hours solving problems that have already been solved for no appreciable benefit.) It's abundantly clear that there is no real technical justification for the clause; Apple is attempting to increase the amount of work that developers have to do to target multiple platforms, so that they'll simply give up and pick one: Apple's.",1272909161

1315441,comment,1314715,1315099,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"In many ways it was a final inflation of the bubble, as profit-takers getting out from a structurally unsound housing & CDO market looked for somewhere to park their excess cash and found a delightfully under-regulated exchange on which to do so. A great number of the oil future contracts were traded on an exchange called ICE, which had managed to set itself up in such a way that both US and UK financial regulators each thought the other was supervising it, when in fact neither were. It's a rather convoluted story that hasn't really been told yet, as it was overshadowed by subsequent events. the reasons I don't think it directly caused the full-scale market collapse are that a) no big banks got massively exposed to the oil price inflation - they could see it was speculative, and it inflated and popped so quickly that they never structured their positions around it; and b) the subprime market and all the other distortions (zero down, stated income, etc.) were already looking ropey by then.<p>Soaring oil prices might have pushed a few consumers over the edge into mortgage default, but even if that hadn't happened I think the market would have imploded within a few months of the 2008 election anyway. Recall that Bear Stearns had to put up $3.2 bn to rescue its two hedge funds in June of 2007, and Merrill Lynch's inability to sell more than about 12% of the CDO assets it seized was the first clue (for the public at large) that the financial industry had a systemic rather than a localized problem - and this was almost a year before the oil price spike. By the time that occurred, the stock market was in decline, Bush had already administered a $145 bn stimulus (remember that $800 tax rebate in 2008?), Bear had collapsed, the NY Fed had underwriting their acquisition by JP Morgan to the tune of $25 billion. So our economy was already in poor shape by March of 08, which was when oil prices suddenly took off like a rocket. At the time, I wondered if the sudden rise was in response to the structural weaknesses in the US and European economies, which shared both enormous housing booms and huge amounts of counterparty risk: it seemed as if traders were looking at oil as a substitute currency (energy is a much better candidate for solid money than gold) and using it to impose a sort of reverse devaluation of the dollar and euro. With hindsight I don't really think so, though - it was a simple pile-in rather than the dawning of a new economic concept.<p>BTW thanks for that CIBC paper you linked to below - although I don't quite agree with the 'big picture' analysis it's still a great read.",1272909107

They're restricting me from using my platform portable pure C code, which is their choice.</i><p>You're missing the point.  Microsoft makes it <i>technically</i> difficult to write a game in a non-.net language, but (at least as far as anyone knows) it's not disallowed in their developer agreement.  If you can get LLVM to spit out .net bytecode that works, then good on you, there's nothing keeping you from using it.  There's no clause that prevents you from writing a Lisp interpreter in your game, nothing to keep you from auto-generating C# from template files, etc.  The only reason people don't do these things is that they're a pain in the ass, not that they would be in violation of the developer's agreements that they signed.<p>Certainly attempting to achieve developer lock-in is part of good business, especially in the world of game development.  But make no mistake, Apple is in uncharted territory here: rather than trying to get people locked-in by providing a smoother workflow with their toolset than they'd find elsewhere (which is what Microsoft does with .NET), they're declaring that all other tools, better or worse, are strictly prohibited.<p><i>They're making choices based on what they think is best for their platform, and letting the market chose. This is how the free market is supposed to work.</i><p>Bundling IE with Windows without any option to replace the browser is what would be best for the Windows platform.  A ""plato o plomo"" acquisition/sued-to-death strategy employed by would-be-monopolists to kill off competition before it's big enough to compete is best for the business.  Gauging prices in a market where a near monopoly exists is ""best for the platform.""<p>What you're really hinting at is a discomfort with the entire idea of anti-trust legislation, another discussion altogether.  Suffice it to say that ""let the market decide"" would, if taken as mantra, excuse every sort of monopolistic or anti-competitive abuse that we've ever seen, which indicates to me that it's not a remotely valid argument.<p>In this case, Apple has, with a stroke of the pen, killed off several toolsets that compete with the one that they're trying to promote.  It reads like a textbook example of tying, using control over a mobile phone application marketplace to kill off competition in the developer tools market, and it's almost entirely targeted at a single competitor (though there's plenty of collateral damage, as well, Unity et al).<p>I think Apple may have something to worry about here.",1272909012

Because this is on the web, you can use text, photos, video, whatever. Just communicate the solution as efficiently as possible.<p>Then your job is to ask people to identify.

It's a bit of a chicken or egg problem, but I went to what are considered some of the best public schools in NYC growing up, and I can tell you they aren't great.  From a quick look they have all the right check boxes: experienced teachers (close look: old, tired, angry teachers), great math, science and humanities programs (rigid, standardized test based curriculum), etc. etc.<p>The education I got was by all means ""good,"" but it was VERY herd mentality, and it as very much about standardizing a body of knowledge and culture NOT about promoting active discourse etc.<p>Yet, I still ended up alright, whereas, considering how ""good"" a high school I went to, many of the kids did not.<p>The difference was the home, the neighborhood and the culture we went home to at night.  Now I know all of this is circular, and a bit of the chicken egg issue, but there is really nothing you can do for people when the household they go back to doesn't support their education.  Conversely, even a horrible school can't ruin a good education provided by your family and community.  You can give them all the help in the world, but no matter how many free college workshops you have, if education isn't explicitly a goal among their friends, family and community they'll realize pretty quickly that it wont be useful in their lives and will disengage.<p>So I'm all for education reform, I think it should be a constant in our society.  Education ALWAYS needs improving.  But we need to be a little more careful with understanding what exactly an education system can and cannot provide.<p>The problems that are in this article can't really be fixed with a better education system, they are symptomatic of far bigger cultural issues that need addressing.",1272906967

38200,comment,37850,37850,0,0,alex_c,,,"A few years back I was talking to the Electrical and Computer Engineering department head at University of Toronto about pretty much the same topic.  He's very much an entrepreneur - started & sold his own business, knows lots of people in the industry, etc.<p>It's not so much something to ""teach"" as a culture that needs to be encouraged.  Sure, you can offer some business, accounting, economics (entrepreneurship?) courses to engineers, and to some extent U of T does that.  But the important thing is, after you graduate chances are you'll do something similar to your friends.  All your colleagues are only talking about grad school or working on their resumes and applying for jobs?  Chances are that's what you'll do.  Been throwing around business ideas with your friends since day 1?  You might actually decide to start something.<p>Don't know if there's an easy solution... good courses and guest speakers help... entrepreneurship/business clubs might help... but if the culture doesn't exist, how do you kickstart it?",1185923614

However, we only hear about the bad that's come from a software rewrite, never the good.  So with today's new coding methods, do articles like this one still apply?  <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html</a><p>Have any of you rewritten or made the decision to rewrite a large codebase?  I know Kiko mentioned it as one of the things that hurt them.  Microsoft was about to do it with their Pyramid Project, but it was axed.<p>Another question, for YC: Do YC companies generally rewrite their projects after Demo Day (since it's supposed to be a throwaway prototype), or work with what they've got?",1185923148

I've come across many stellar engineers who are passionate about producing beautiful code, but produce sparse, uninteresting UI's - why should we not also be passionate about producing beautiful, elegant user interfaces?",1185922991

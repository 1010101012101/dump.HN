Perhaps for these people, their lack of social skills means their career is somewhat stunted.<p>Is there something about bad behavior, exhibited by a skilled or high-status person, that is more infective of community values than good behavior?

2723881,comment,2723505,2723734,3,0,antiterra,,,"Even the forced slant in that ""round-up"" doesn't really serve to justify the conclusion in its last sentence. There is also no coherent argument that a dubious origin necessarily implies the lack of useful premise.<p>The Internet and personal computing technology indeed add ""roll-your-own"" options to publishing and completing a work that did not exist beforehand. But, at this point, they certainly have not replaced the need for the (sometimes creative) work done to support the work of authors. Things like: editing, typesetting, music production, video post-processing etc.<p>What happens when the publishing model is dead? Look at poetry. Poets still write, and some of it is decent. However, big publishers won't touch a poetry book that isn't a classic or a guaranteed sale anthology. Smaller imprints will usually only bother if the book has won a prize. In a number of cases authors pay a reading fee to enter contests,  and the fee pays for the publishing of the book in a near break even scenario. In the case where poems are published on the internet, there's a small but arguable respectable audience, however there's no money changing hands whatsoever. Poets have second jobs, I know some who just gave up, who went into finance and law. I'll grant that lack of market is more of an issue as copying in this case, but publishers can help make markets. It should be easy to see how the effects are related. That is to say:<p>What's the difference between a bitcoin and a poem? You can buy food with a bitcoin.<p>Not everyone wants to be a sustenance farmer for a living.",1309708534

Thats going on for years and so far neither Bing nor anyone else has made any real progress. Also the whole idea that people moving slowly from search to discovery is so far only speculation and I dont buy it. Besides being quite cumbersome to ask my friends there are many areas where I just dont trust them. For example IMDB is much better in predicting if I will like a certain movie than anyone of my friends is (or even all of them combined).<p>On all other fronts Google is not attacked but is attacking. They started from zero in pretty much all the fields you are mentioning a couple of years ago and have recently made some impressive gains (especially Android and Chrome). So its not Google who is facing challenging test but Microsoft (Office, Windows, IE, WP7 ), Apple (Iphone, OSX), Facebook/Tumblr/Quora and Yelp/Groupon.

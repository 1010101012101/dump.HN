So the developers draw you in with what appears to be a skill game that you can enjoy playing, and then after they&#x27;ve got you committed they gradually turn it into a money game by making it progressively more and more unfair.<p>I can&#x27;t remember where the article is that I read about all this though.",1393664044
7323686,comment,7319306,7320037,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"<i>The entire idea of &quot;subreddits&quot; is community-specific curation.</i><p>There are a number of significant issues with that.  Straight off the top, a few that I can think of:<p>• /r/news is a default subreddit.  It carries rather more weight and significance on reddit than, say, /r/swoleacceptance or /r/dredmorbius.  It really ought to reflect a fair assessment of what is or isn&#x27;t news.<p>• Subreddit squatting has been known to happen, often by those with a specific axe to grind.  In the worst cases, this leads to a very profound drift of a sub from what its initial charter was.  /r/srs is probably one of the more significant examples (it went from a general critique sub to a pretty radical political viewpoint).  Another case which came up recently is /r/xkcd, yes, the subreddit devoted to the xkcd comic.  After its initial moderator went AWOL, it was picked up by a neo-Nazi, Holocaust-denying mod, who installed a number of similarly-minded sub-mods.  Randall Munroe even chimed in to voice his disappointment.  An alternative sub has formed, /r/xkcdcomic.  Story:  <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1xdwba/the_history_of_the_rxkcd_kerfuffle/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1xdwba/the_history_of_...</a><p>• There&#x27;s no real mechanism to keep subreddit drift from happening.  This, given the issues above, seems like it could be a long-term problem for reddit.<p>• In the absence of &quot;acceptable&quot; mainstream news coverage of the latest from The Intercept, it seems that /r/news really should have accepted the article.  As Greenwald has noted, the MSM and government are clearly biased in their own coverage of this story.",1393664041

C. Bennett Hoffman Buttercoin CTO\n===<p>The project started off as a bit of announce-first development in response to the MtGox issues during the run-up in price last April. We had a lot of really enthusiastic people all trying to figure out what it was we were actually trying to do. Many people wanted to build a completely distributed exchange, others wanted to go other directions. That&#x27;s the beauty of open projects, even if it can be a bit overwhelming.<p>Cedric and I already had an interview with Y Combinator scheduled to pitch a different bitcoin idea. A few of us decided to focus on building something we could use to launch a real platform and pitch that instead. We started from scratch and kept it closed to focus on that, always with the intention of opening it back up once it was at least somewhat usable.<p>It&#x27;s taken way to long to get there. Why are we waiting for launch? Mostly because we&#x27;re too busy. There&#x27;s still a good amount of code specific to our deployment mixed into the stuff that&#x27;s actually usable by anyone else. I&#x27;m embarrassed to admit we even have a couple of test passwords and API keys floating around in the repos.\nIn short, we&#x27;re humans of limited capacity. If I were to do it again, I&#x27;d go about things differently, but if we can put up a technically solid trading platform that helps make bitcoin (and other digital currencies) more widely adopted, then I&#x27;ll have no regrets.\n===<p>Hope this helps add context to where we are and why.  If you have more questions, please ask, we&#x27;ll do our best to answer quickly.",1393663340

We also know that certain types of treatment make them less likely to whine, or cry when hurt.<p>When Fred Rodgers talks to a little boy and asks him about what makes him really mad inside, is he encouraging temper tantrums, or is he standing in contrast to the spectrum of a boozy mummy and daddy on one side who don&#x27;t want disruption and a short tempered, beaten down set of parents on the other?<p>If you live in a highly structured, hierarchical society with a strong patronage system, your children are probably going to live better lives if you breed a strong sense of deference to authority. If that isn&#x27;t the case, being kind of mousy might find them mousy lives.<p>Whining may be really unpleasant for any adult in the vicinity, yet unjustified whining from a 4 year old is not the same as unjustified whining from a 25 year old. If it&#x27;s unjustified the 25 year old is choosing to be a victim. On the other hand, the 4 year old does not have the rational or emotional capacity to judge what is or is not the end of the world. You <i>can</i> train the 4 year old to no longer whine, by focusing on the whining and making that a singular, traumatic event. And yet, what you probably want, is for your child to fight back on things that actually matter, and also to use more effective means than pathetic whining.<p>--Ineffective, bad argumentation techniques used on embarrassingly unimportant topics-- And yet, a four year old is unlikely to see that as the banner. Instead, they are likely to see, mommy or daddy goes nuclear if I insist &quot;I must have&quot;.<p>You remembered the incident clear enough to make the connection that it was a a dumb issue that your toddler self were pushing, but another toddler would have just interpreted it as a statement about who was in charge, or for it to be wrong to feel strongly. In the grown up world, how often do people unjustifiably feel that it is presumptuous to ask for a raise. Or, how much innovation has been hindered by people bowing their head when their boss ignores their idea, rather than going out on their own and putting their former employer out of business.<p>Anyway, back to the original topic, programs with in-app purchases are intended to get money, and some are sophisticated enough to manipulate adults into spending more than they otherwise would. There are a few options here. You can have a teachable moment: don&#x27;t ask mommy and daddy for things. Or the teachable moment: <long explanation about the subtleties of marketing, which your 4yo won&#x27;t understand anyway>. Or finally, a short time with a game <without in-app purchases>, then later some fun finger painting.<p>Since, sadly, the presence of some childish behaviors that are unpleasant to adults are better than their absence, an absence of triggers can be nice. You can know how to scare your child from whining, decide not to, but also hold the combination of beliefs that you don&#x27;t want to spoil them and you don&#x27;t want to hear whining on this particular car trip.

You can read whole books in Algebra and not mean the word &quot;Monoid&quot; once in them, including some university books.<p>For example (not even one mention):\n<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&linkCode=qs&keywords=9780387406244"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&linkCode=qs&keyw...</a><p>This again no mention:\n<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&linkCode=qs&keywords=9781285402734"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&linkCode=qs&keyw...</a><p>This (a &quot;graduate level&quot; book) only mentions Monoid once, somewhere on the first pages, and adds that it won&#x27;t be emphasised:\n<a href=""http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=C4TByeUh9A4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=C4TByeUh9A4C&printsec=fr...</a><p>And I&#x27;m pretty sure in our Algebra books (for CS students, 2 classes in the 1st and 2nd year) there was no much mention of monoids (or, possibly, the professor skipped over those chapters, maybe had some brief explanation and went on to other things).<p>Of course, what university gradutes of a field do not know can sometimes be even more daunting.

I recently discovered that even if you set Google Play to always require a password (which apparently isn&#x27;t even necessarily the default(?)), you still don&#x27;t require a password for 30 minutes after any purchase. That means that if I buy a game for my son to play with, any in-game purchases he randomly clicks on automatically get approved.<p>Fortunately I get them refunded when I complain, but it&#x27;s still a stupid policy.",1393661206

Tim Sweeney showed me this trick a long time ago, which he combined with run-time code patching so that an arithmetic operation would be speculatively compiled as either fixnum or bignum based on observed run-time behavior. It&#x27;d compile it to fixnum by default with an overflow trap using the FP inexact exception. The trap would patch the fixnum site with the equivalent bignum code and resume. With hindsight inspired by modern trace compilers like LuaJIT, the better approach is probably to compile entire traces speculated on either case, so you can hoist most of the guard predicates and not speculate based solely on the proximate call site but on longer traces.",1438503853

Some web clients were terrible and did terrible things.<p>WebTV in particular would add animated gif backgrounds and MIDI music. Since Usenet was a text medium those messages would have the gif and midi encoded as text (UUENCODEd?) and added to the post, with a bunch of raw HTML as well.  Other users got huge amounts of HTML and uuencoded &quot;stuff&quot; or they got animated backgrounds and MIDI music - either one was pretty awful.",1438503185

I have worked in languages where this is the default (Standard ML) and it&#x27;s quite nice.  You can always explicitly use a word-type if you actually want overflow.  With hardware support, it is even fairly cheap to implement, as you just connect the overflow bit of your integer ALUs to something interrupt-triggering.",1438503032

However you slice it, biting the bullet and buying your own PV system is way way better than leasing it.<p>Maybe there are cases where leasing makes sense...but those are few and far between...or maybe SolarCity counts on people being uninformed/clueless, which is why this &#x27;lease&#x27; model works.

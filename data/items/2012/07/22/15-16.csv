I already had two years of credit under my belt when I went back to school and it took me four years of study half-time and all three semesters (Fall/Spring/Summer) during the year to finish.  Best thing I ever did.<p>Let me give you some advice:<p>1. Start slow.  Take one class to start with.  Get used to the pace of lecture/study and getting your assignments done.  It's very hard to work full time and also study.  You will need uninterrupted space and time to get your work done.<p>2. If you're taking online classes, you MUST be sure that your teaching fellow/assistant and professor are willing to communicate via email or instant message.  If you can attend office hours DO IT.  It helps for a professor to see you as a serious student and not as a faceless email address.  GO EARLY in the semester to office hours and make it a regular thing.  THIS PAYS DIVIDENDS AT GRADING TIME.<p>3. Make sure your school is a ""real"" school.  Don't go to one of those for-profit schools.  Make sure that your school is regionally accredited by the REAL accrediting agencies, not the fake ones that are set up by the for-profit schools.<p>4. Connect with another student (or students) and work with them.  Just like for startups, it helps to be ""in it"" with someone else.<p>Good luck.<p>P.S.  One of the guys I helped get through my program was a father of five kids (and one of the way) and he took two flights each way one day a week for a year to attend class.  After 3 years he finished.  He also held down a full-time job while he did this.  It's do-able.  You just have to commit yourself to doing it.<p>EDIT: more advice.",1342971203

With this type of mobile OS, such things become alot more viable i feel and in that I look forward to the outcome.<p>Be nice if you cold just buy your phone and had a choice of the operating system as well, manufacturers pay attention, as for you then you could sell hardware and have another company sell the OS and make all the IP trolls have a harder time blocking hardware over a simple software issue in a OS.  I realy wished they would.  If you gave the OS away then that would also limit certain types of lawsuits fiscaly as well.

If you are not ever sued for infringing, nor asked to pay licensing fees by an agent of the patent holder, nothing happens and it's effectively moot.  This is the most likely outcome.<p>If you are sued/asked to pay, you could try to invalidate the patent (or threaten that) because there is prior art... i.e. your implementation.  You can only do that if you can prove that you implemented it, at a specific date sometime before the patent filing.  This may not be easy. In fact - and ideally, there is a USPTO officer reading this who can comment - it may be the case that something can only be considered prior art if it's been published in a textbook, tech industry journal article, etc.  (Or if there another existing patent for it).<p>Ideally your evidence is so strong, the patent holder will look at it and decide it's not worth taking you to court (i.e. they believe they will lose, or even risk getting their patent invalidated).  Then they back away slowly from you, going after easier prey.<p>If you go to court for any reason, it's likely to be a long, hard drain on your energy, time and money.",1342969860

Then jump to next frame, and the line has abruptly jumped forwards. Which is what must happen with sequential frames in low-light. So the total effect looks jerky.<p>Now let's suppose these were 30-second exposures. What if the camera instead took 30 1-second exposures, each of which were severely underexposed. But then software would add frames 1-30 to generate a well-exposed ""final frame 1"", then frames 2-31 to generate ""final frame 2"", frames 3-32 to generate ""final frame 3"", and so on. Each final frame would have full exposure, but the final output would be beautifully smooth, with ""natural""-feeling motion blur.<p>This probably requires on-the-fly computation far beyond any kind of consumer camera. But does anyone know of software that does this? It would be fairly straightforward to write.",1342969298

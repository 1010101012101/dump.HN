6773127,comment,6772527,6772527,3,0,thatinstant,,,"Of course the surveillance is about control... It seems so obvious to me that I don&#x27;t even give it much thought, but I think there are far too many variables affecting the current state of affairs, regarding the NSA, surveillance, etc.  It wasn&#x27;t just one event, one government administration, one legislative change or one technological advancement that got us into this mess.  Several factors have converged to create the current police state, but I ask: Why are people suddenly so upset about finding out that the NSA has found an efficient means to surveil the populous when so many organizations have been doing this for years?<p>Nobody was getting upset when Google was reading your emails; Facebook was reading your private messages; Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile were tracking your calls and geo-locations... All for the sake of more efficiently marketing to you.  Advertisement is just another form of control.  They don&#x27;t tell you or force you to do or not do something, they just efficiently convince people to part with their money and make those people think that it was their own idea to do so all along.<p>All these concerns come down to whether we collectively think these practices are right or wrong, and it is becoming more difficult to make these judgements without a bias and it&#x27;s difficult to continually evaluate whether your bias has been externally affected by these business practices.<p>The reason why nothing is truly being done about this massive theft of privacy is because people are complacent with the idea. We can&#x27;t truly get upset that our governments are taking away our privacy when we have been giving it away to private corporations and religious organizations for so long.",1385009976

6773108,comment,6766097,6771058,2,0,Pitarou,,,"> I think it&#x27;s unfair to place the blame squarely on the student. Even in college, the academic system emphasizes memorization and surface-level application (knowing how to &quot;use a formula&quot;) over the kind of &quot;thinking&quot; you&#x27;re describing.<p>You&#x27;re quite right. I can&#x27;t possibly give a fair, nuanced description of the issue in a couple of paragraphs, and I&#x27;m nowhere near qualified to give the definitive account of the problem. Still, you&#x27;re right that I do place more blame on the learners than most. Maybe people shy away from these ideas because they&#x27;re dangerously close to some rather sinister <i>Brave New World</i>-style educational theories.<p>In teaching, I think we have a chicken-and-egg problem. We want students to learn both the underlying abstraction and the surface details. But the weaker students are resistant to learning the underlying abstraction, so we drop that and drill them harder on the surface details instead.<p>I see no easy solutions to this problem.<p>> Also, many professionals are called upon to solve problems that require this same kind of &quot;thinking&quot;. Academics are not the only ones wrestling with difficult problems.<p>Sure. Computer programmers are an obvious case. But a perusal of the Daily WTF&#x27;s archives (<a href=\"http://thedailywtf.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://thedailywtf.com/</a>), or the fact that many professional programmers with long careers still can&#x27;t pass the FizzBuzz test, shows you that there is still a problem.",1385009490

As a Microsft employee at the time, I struggled longer than any mortal should to get WMP to sync music to my 2003-era Windows Phone.

They were clearly looking at Egypt and back to OWS and thinking &quot;that shit can NOT be allowed to happen here&quot;.<p>So, how to stop the next one? Mass surveillance - pick out the seedlings of discontent and crush them before they grow big enough to become threatening again.<p>I&#x27;m convinced is also the reason why they considered assassination.

Obviously so, since otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t have formed a government with laws after the Treaty of Paris, and then scrapped that government a few years later because it sucked so bad that it needed replaced with an <i>even stronger</i> government that the U.S. still operates under today.<p>Rather, their problem was the lack of the British Crown&#x27;s desire (in their view) to uphold Britain&#x27;s own laws and charters as applied to the colonies.",1385006859

If I don't use their editor, I assume I'd have to upload the files somehow. The whole reason I'm using git now intsead of Subversion is because I cannot guarantee my internet connectivity. And I hate to admit it, any little interruption like that often serves as an excuse to not work on code. <p>If I use their import functionality to update the app, I can do it quicker by typing 'cap deploy' on the command line. <p>Don't get me wrong -- I think this is a pretty neat idea, particularly for folks who don't have much time or money invested in their own equipment. With the Facebook and Google social APIs out, I can see this as the preferred tool for sketching out an idea, and getting some users.<p>But for someone like me who has the infrastructure setup already, it would have to be insanely better than pounding away at my laptop, using my own version control system, the various versions of Rails I can use it with, running tests, the occasional need for BackgroundRB apps. Yeah, it does make me feel as if I weren't keeping up with the times, but then again, I have a hobby of finding gems in obscure ruins of antiquity. ",1194699902

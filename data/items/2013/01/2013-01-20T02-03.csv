5085805,comment,5085216,5085216,2,0,eduardordm,,,"Nice heads up. It seems that most newbie entrepreneurs don't really want to get their hands dirty (which is obviously not programming).<p>Yet, success is a very abstract concept. With that in mind I don't think that, in general, success is rare. Failure and success are both abundant. A single outcome can be a success and failure, depending on what is your baseline.<p>For example, when I built a small financial firm my goal was to build something cool AND get bloody rich. I failed on that. Yet, we have millions of customers right now. My dream of retiring before 30 to work for fun didn't work out.",1358650735

My goal is to address all those people who need to use craigslist to find vendors, or do a google search as you mentioned.  The feedback I've received from all these people is that it really isn't feasible to find good vendors in this manner.  Craigslist doesn't offer reviews - it's really a shot in the dark, and performing google searches is a long and tedious process.  The desire was to have one site from which to find vendors, see/leave reviews, and interact with the vendors through the site, in realtime.<p>All that being said, advertising/marketing is certainly not easy and is an area which may require a bit more cash flow in order to get widespread attention.<p>Not a killjoy at all - I appreciate the feedback",1358650496

5085782,comment,5084791,5085716,4,0,jacquesm,,,"> What I can't understand is that you seem to think that it is simultaneously true that law enforcement can fully investigate these kinds of criminal activity without at least the tacit awareness of the owners, and that the owners can somehow convince the crime lords that they would have had nothing to do with law enforcement's later arrests (especially given the coffeehouse you mention).<p>Criminals congregating in a place gives you a good reason to visit the place. The owner would not have to have anything to do with that at all, clearly the police is aware this is a problem spot, the occasional probe by officers is then to be expected. That's called patrolling the neighbourhood and investigating suspicious activity. There is a clear mandate for that. All they'd have to do to get rid of most of the undesirables would be to have a coffee there twice daily, unannounced at random times.<p>I don't see how confiscating one of the premises is a valid member of the solution set either, but clearly that's more profitable than old fashioned police work and walking a beat. A visible presence is a very effective deterrent in cases like this.<p>That <i>still</i> won't solve the underlying problem, and it will likely <i>still</i> result in a shift.

What she shows is what the propaganda from the communist party leaders wants foreigners to see.  The truth is way less rosy (which, yes, makes it really very scary).<p>The hotel is fake.  The trafic is fake.  The shops are fake.  She did realize that they do create products that don't have a market but it's worse than that: they create fake malls (well, actually one fake mall, which every single visitor shall see if he wants to see a mall) just to make believe visitors that they have malls.<p>The entire trip is under supervision and every ""delegation"" that goes there get to see the exact same things, give or take one or two things.<p>For example the tramway picture: it's in basically every single movie show from foreign ""journalist"" who got to get there.  I say ""journalist"" because they're not allowed to do anything on their own: they're constantly accompanied by members from the party.<p>Poverty is hidden in basically every street where, of course, you're not allowed to go.<p>I speak several languages so I can watch TV from different countries: it's always the same.  At one point me and my girlfriend considered going, so we started watching as much movies as we could about North Korea and we started to realize that all the (totally non-connected) delegations were always doing the exact same visits.  After three of them we knew what we were going to see in the fourth one.<p>What about the truth?  Well independent reporters have reported famine and people eating roots during cold winters.<p>It's really frightening to realize what communism does to people from both a liberty point of view and a poverty point of view.<p>I'm honestly not sure the author understood what happened to her.",1358650105

We can treat them generically without having to teach our program about the specific problem it's trying to solve. All we have to do is come up with proposed solutions and pare them down.<p>For starters, we need a ""cost function"" so we can see which solutions are better than others. That's the easy part: render the model on 3D hardware, lighting it with a distant point light source. The ""cost"" (the value we're trying to minimize) is 1 - (face_brightness); modern hardware can easily handle precise geometric shadowing using a stencil buffer or similar well-known technique. Handle the thermal constraints by setting the ""cost"" to 1 when the space station disintegrates.<p>Now we just need to find some ways of coming up with proposed solutions and pruning all but the best solutions. This problem has path dependencies, so we can't just apply a greedy algorithm. That is, solar panel actuators take time to move, so the best solution for time [T_1, T_3] isn't necessarily the concatenations of the best individual solutions for intervals [T_1, T_2] and [T2, T_3].<p>What you're left with is actually a graph search problem, where our graph nodes are actuator inputs at specific (quantized) times; I feel like something like the veneralbe A* algorihm would be a good place to start looking for paths through this graph.",1358649184

Sometimes, they just want your stuff: when the police seize your property, they get to sell it and keep the proceeds.<p>The requirements to ""win"" a civil forfeiture case is incredibly low - much lower than, for instance, proving a crime was committed. Innocent victims (i.e. the rare cases where a forfeiture is overturned) always have their things seized immediately to begin with, because the standard of ""proof"" is so unbelievably low. It's just as easy to seize from the innocent as it is from the guilty.<p>When people first learn about civil forfeiture, the disbelief, the cognitive dissonance that such a thing even <i>exists</i> is amazing.

It is commonly believed that C is a hack which was successful because Unix was written in it. I disagree. Over a long period of time computer architectures evolved, not because of some clever people figuring how to evolve architectures---as a matter of fact, clever people were pushing tagged architectures during that period of time---but because of the demands of different programmers to solve real problems. Computers that were able to deal just with numbers evolved into computers with byte-addressable memory, flat address spaces, and pointers. This was a natural evolution reflecting the growing set of problems that people were solving. C, reflecting the genius of Dennis Ritchie, provided a minimal model of the computer that had evolved over 30 years. C was not a quick hack. As computers evolved to handle all kinds of problems, C, being the minimal model of such a computer, became a very powerful language to solve all kinds of problems in different domains very effectively. This is the secret of C's portability: it is the best representation of an abstract computer that we have. Of course, the abstraction is done over the set of real computers, not some imaginary computational devices. Moreover, people could understand the machine model behind C. It is much easier for an average engineer to understand the machine model behind C than the machine model behind Ada or even Scheme. C succeeded because it was doing the right thing, not because of AT&T promoting it or Unix being written with it.""",1358648077

Because Web addresses are not static (i.e., they change often) and because documents sometimes appear in multiple places on the Web (e.g., on multiple databases), MLA explains that most readers can find electronic sources via title or author searches in Internet Search Engines.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/08/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/08/</a>",1358647664

But with that in mind those other countries have  different concepts of the legal system (the vision of what it accomplishes, the policies, everything). I'm not here to claim that the U.S. legal system is 100% appropriate to the task, but instead that the prosecutors are going to the job with the resources that they have. If Congress significantly reduces the category and criteria of what counts as crimes by getting rid of the stupid stuff then great, but that's not the system the prosecutors are in now.<p>> Maybe we could get expedience by, you know, focusing prosecution effort on serious crimes or ones that actually have victims.<p>Do you have any specific cases in mind involving serious crimes or crimes with more deserving victims (since apparently MIT doesn't count) that were <i>not</i> prosecuted due to the resources needed being assigned to the Swartz case?<p>> You might want to read up on how plea bargaining is viewed in other countries.<p>Please don't take this the wrong way but I don't operate my life based on opinion polls. If I'm right, then I'm right, and if I'm wrong (which is certainly possible) it won't be because Bjrn and Herr Mller have different <i>opinions</i> about what plea bargaining is and is not, it will be because I'm wrong.",1358647658

387780,comment,386910,387027,0,0,jfornear,,,"Wages are not effected by leverage or productivity. Productivity only matters when figuring out how many laborers you should hire. Leverage is just a weird way of masking the fact that higher paid workers are in low supply and high demand. Leveraging can only exist in instances where supply is low and demand is high!<p>1) The supply and demand of labor determines wages.<p>2) The factors that determine where you might lie on the demand curve for labor are: skill level, education, experience, reputation, etc.<p>3) The higher up the Demand curve, these factors become in shorter supply because it is hard to level up in real life. (MMO reference, sorry.)<p>4) The higher the demand of skills, experience, reputation, education, etc. >>> the lower the supply of labor will be >>> the higher wages will be.",1228531643

If you read it carefully, they mention that there is space for improvement, but they want to have it out so people can start to use and see the differences. Release early, release often (and it took 3 years to get there, so better do this once and for all.)",1228531253

We're <i>so</i> close to being able to harness the sun's energy efficiently (of which several hundred watts-worth can be hitting a square meter per hour), and when it becomes possible, it'll be more game changing than the proliferation of the telephone or the Internet.<p>Imagine.. next-to-free power almost anywhere on the planet at almost any time (assuming battery technology keeps up too).

I was able to lower prices to slightly below ec2  probably a year ago, and now, my prices are about half amazon.com.<p>Really, though, I don't think of it as lowering prices.  I think of it as giving the customer more resources for the same price.  The cost of ram and cpu (both capital costs, and recurring power costs)  per unit is dropping rather fast, while the per-account overhead (a big deal for me, because my provisioning system sucks.  probably less of a big deal for amazon.)  remains about the same.",1228530813

How can you trust any third party to be acting in your best interest?<p>The situation comes up anywhere where you don't have domain knowledge of the project. I've seen several people get burned by shody contractors, plumbers, mechanics, ect.

3258318,comment,3256317,3256317,2,0,gbog,,,"I find it strange that such a complaint about typography is done on a web-page I have hard time reading with my Chrome. The font is too small, and trying to enlarge it make the column narrower but the font size stay the same. When selecting text has some weird contours. There are some CSS tricks behind this, I guess. They seem to imply that the author is not fully aware of the number 1 rule of typography: it must be done according to the medium.<p>Books and newspapers don't have the same typographic rules. The web have other rules. Ebooks probably have other yet-to-be-invented rules.<p>But I agree with the claim: most of the books I have read on my Kindle have bad typography. It should be fixed on two sides: The reader's software can be improved[1], and ebooks have to be proofread and adapted to this medium.<p>[1] Oh I wish Amazon could iterate on the Kindle (I mean the real one, with e-ink), improve its reader software, its browser, etc., instead of running after iPad's success.",1321804594

What I meant was that this comes at an expense. This power means one has to deal with a very extensive API. This is great for someone who needs it (or knows it), but when building a personal site, dealing with an API requiring more than a couple of pages of documentation seems <i>wrong</i> (to me). Something like having to keep af functions.php with a 20+ sloc function to generate the current page title.<p>Obviously Wordpress does not suck, it is one of the most used blogging platforms. The feeling I got when tweaking it to do something different from the standard themes was that I was using a chainsaw to slice a loaf of bread. It was certainly powerful enough and it could certainly get the job done, but it wasn't easy and it wasn't elegant.<p>And here is an overview of the files in my custom wordpress theme: <a href=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3240627/wordpress_folder_structure.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3240627/wordpress_folder_structure.p...</a> :)",1321802232

From the plane's window we saw the moment we entered the enormous, province-sized sea of gray clouds over the Sichuan basin, leaving behind us blue sky and sunny hills.

They actually prefer year-long heavy gray sky!<p>No kidding.<p>People complaining about their weather is not related at all to the quality of their local weather, which is not easy to define anyway.

Seems the apprentice route has either been abolished or fallen into disuse, though.<p>This article's proposals for reform don't really seem on the mark, though.

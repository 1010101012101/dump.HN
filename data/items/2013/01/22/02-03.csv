Women are under-represented in STEM for historical reasons that amount to widespread sexism.<p>You suggest gender-blindness is the solution.  I don't disagree that such blindness is a worthwhile goal, but to simply say ""let's all be gender blind now"" without addressing an existing under-representation just cements the imbalance.  Demographics realities have inertia.  Women don't go into STEM just because that's not something 'that women do'.  It's only appropriate to be blind once the imbalance is wiped out.<p>That's not to say that affirmative action as previously imagined is the right way to address the imbalance--it's been shown not to be for a variety of reasons.  But as this shows, and as GoGaRuCo shows, when you eliminate gender advantages for men, women are selected equally in blind judging, so there's no essential difference between men and women, just an historical artifact worth eliminating.",1358823125

You don't need to bus in a bunch of twelve year old girls and point at the female speakers.  You just need the field itself not to look so totally male.  In medicine, rising female participation outside of nursing has demonstrably accelerated the rate of female participation since the 1970s.  The same can happen in the rest of the STEM field.

Why does Arment feel it's necessary to throw stones like this? I realize some are reading this as a more ""balanced"" post, but I have to side with those considering this to be yet more elitism as I've come to expect.<p>Just as anecdotally, but no less data-driven, there is an obvious counter argument to his claim. I will concede his notion that Apple people don't spew anti-Android on pro-Android posts. That is because, from my own informal observations, Apple fans are too busy defending their own gates on the Apple support forums. It is unequivocally the most combative and abrasive ""help forum"" I've ever experienced.<p>As a person who owns and really enjoy Apple products (the MacBook Air, for my needs, is hands-down the best computer I've ever owned... and what I'm typing on at this moment), they're still far from perfect. Numerous times I've tried searching for resolutions to issues, and naturally, discussions.apple.com is typically a top result on Google. Even when finding an OP that precisely describes the issue I'm experiencing, more often than not, responses are along the exact lines of how Arment describes Apple's response:<p><i>""You dont need that. Here, try this partial workaround or alternative solution instead.""</i><p>Except, they usually don't ""just work."" And yes, I really do <i>need</i> what Apple broke. It took until 10.8.2 for Remote Desktop to work reliably again after Mountain Lion's initial release. I spent hours researching and found no reasonable workaround to get an piece of software written by Apple to work with Apple's OS. But yet, there were plenty of people asking why that was needed. I merely had to setup this convoluted alternative and I would be back in business... oh, wait. That still didn't work.<p>In my mind, this is worse than Arment's claim, as it's Apple people getting attacked by other Apple people for the heresy of wanting something to work. He's railing against the anger from Microsoft and Android, but he is okay with the cannibalism in the Apple camp?<p>I could go on, but I feel like I've already written a disproportionate amount more than I actually care about this guy's hypocritical, fact-less editorials. I guess my opinion finally got dragged low enough with this post to finally speak up. I would suggest he looks a little closer to the mothership before trying to paint this kind of picture.

You would give a 50 year old beginner advice more like the teenager, probably, but still not the same. For one thing, you'd expect them to be a bit less brash about what they've done, because we rightly expect adults to have a bit more perspective on their place in the world. And in fact, we see lots of posts here saying ""I've been programming 6 months, look what I did."" And when we do, the tone is usually quite different on their part. They know they have a lot to learn, etc.<p>In my experience as a teacher, I would say that the most success I've had with teenagers was when I was able to show them that I trusted them to do a good job, and that I acknowledged that they could function on a higher level than a child. That doesn't mean I treated them the same as adults, because they're not. Let me give you an example:<p>When I was in high school, I was among the best young musicians in my state. I was twice ranked principal in the All State Orchestra, and I ended up going to one of the top music schools in the country. I won awards and scholarships and was praised by all, yada yada.<p>And yet, when I listen to recordings of myself play from that time, I am struck by two things -- one, that I was amazingly self assured, and two, that I sounded terrible. I couldn't hold a candle to any pro in any orchestra you could name. When you're a teenager, <i>you suck at everything that is worth doing</i>. You also suck at recognizing that fact, and are hormonally hard wired to not be able to examine your weaknesses. There are exceptions to the rule, always, but anyone in any kind of advisory capacity to a young person needs to recognize that and treat them accordingly. The last thing a kid who loves doing something needs is to be shown that they suck. Once they have a bit more skin in the game, the self examination can start.",1358821424

Their dictator like ways of, ""We're freezing your account and keeping your money unless you send us all of your receipts proving all transactions are legitimate"" have screwed so many over the years. I think it's a little too late to repair Paypal's image, the customer support staff are the least human like support staff I've ever dealt with. All responses from Paypal customer support are copied and pasted, 99% of the time ignoring what you've actually typed out. Maybe they should fix that problem while they're there.<p>I seriously doubt these aggressive changes will change anything, if they do it will probably only reduce the number of incorrectly frozen accounts by a small percentage. Paypal will always be brought down by their uneducated, non-compassionate customer support staff and their horrible policies. While my experience with them on a business level has been somewhat limited (I do have a business premier pro account) and I myself haven't had any serious issues, I've been through the frozen funds thing before but came out unscathed although after digging through the crappy support and finally getting someone with enough drive and compassionate to ensure my problems were resolved.<p>The number one problem isn't the policies, because a lot of people have nothing but good experiences with Paypal it's their staff, the people on the front-line who ensure your queries are appropriately directed and brought to the attention of the right people internally to solve your problem, these staff are misinterpreting policies and not listening. Another tolerable problem is Paypal's API: it feels archaic and pretty poor in comparison to other payment competitors with much nicer JSON API's and support for Javascript payments processing like Square.

Then I wouldn't have to feel anymore"". And this scared the crap out of me, because I was just healthy enough to recognize that this wasn't normal, and I was finally at the point when I couldn't really deny it anymore.<p>I ended calling the schools mental health services the next day and I got into therapy (which was one of the more difficult things I've ever had to do and I hated every minute of it, but I credit it with probably saving my life), and got on some drugs for a while.

Why not find an industry with mostly male employees, offer jobs at 57 percent of the current wages in that industry, attract an all-Latina workforce, and crush the competition with labor costs that are a fraction of those in the rest of the industry?</i><p><a href=""http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2012/12/17/profit-opportunity-if-women-earn-less-than-men/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2012/12/17/profit-opportu...</a>",1358820641

I was 15 and that was the best year of my life up to that point (ages 10 to 14 really sucked and I would understand if it had happened at that time).\nI didn't do anything special, just covered my head with my pillow cover. After a few seconds I realised that wouldn't work, dropped it and went on to sleep.\nI don't remember when or how the second time happened, all I remember is that I tried a second time that same year. Many times I caught myself thinking about using gas to end it all, but I would not do anything that would cause trouble to my family (even though I had no reason to like them at the time).<p>A few years later, I got really depressed after a party and, on my way home, I stopped in a bridge, looking to the river and thinking. I knew I would never have the courage to jump, but I stood there. Then, from the other side of the bridge, came an old crazy friend, he was really drunk and hugged me real hard, leaving me with the stench of cachaa (brazilian rum). He kept going and I went home.<p>I never had any suicidal thought after that. On contrary, sometimes I feel that I now am ""immune"" to that kind of thing. Even if I feel depressed, it all goes away after a good night sleep. And I even became a person that is really good at talking to people with suicidal thoughts. I'm 24 now and, in the last five years, I've had a few friends come to me saying they were thinking about killing themselves and I somehow made them feel better.<p>I think that the most important thing when talking to people about this is: never say ""don't to it"". I usually say: ""it's up to you, but.. have you considered this and that?"" If you just tell them no to do it, they will ignore you, because they will think you don't understand their problems. And they are probably right about that.",1358820452

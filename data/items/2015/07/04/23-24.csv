Just because you apparently are ignorant of them doesn&#x27;t mean they haven&#x27;t been occurring.<p>While admittedly ignorant of the specific changes in water and sewage provision, I never suggested they weren&#x27;t occurring - I said the experience for an end user hasn&#x27;t really changed much. Even if the water quality has increased tenfold and a city&#x27;s demand trebled in a decade, we&#x27;re still pulling water from the tap the same way we were before, and our usage year over year doesn&#x27;t change that much (on a household basis). My household needs and expectations for water service don&#x27;t seem any different than 15 years ago, whereas my household needs and expectations for internet service are radically different.

They&#x27;d have a room of 100 typists all typing away all day for 8+ hours a day for five days a week.<p>That is until the Word Processor and Laser Printer caught on and then they only needed 1 person to press 100 copies on the Word Processor after typing up the letter and memo. Learning how a PC works and how a Word Processor works requires a higher level skill than a typewriter.<p>I used to work for a law firm IT department. I was given a series of tasks to automate forms into electric forms that were ASP web based and use Crystal Reports to export to RTF, PDF, XLS format etc. I did my job and the people who used to do the reports by hand got fired. They got replaced with an web app that worked 24/7 for free and stores data on a MS-SQL Server database.<p>I felt really bad that what I wrote had cost jobs.<p>Consider web sites that work 24/7 selling items, they put retail stores to be closed and people who work those retail jobs to be fired. Macy&#x27;s closed down stores near my house and fired people, and my wife orders her dresses from macys.com instead of going to a store now.<p>Now you might say you need to learn some IT skills to service and support websites and technical issues, but they offshore that work to India and China for cheaper labor. Anything needed on US soil they can hire H1B Visa Workers for cheaper than US citizens to work those jobs. So yes jobs are being created, but some of those jobs goes to foreign workers who can work for a lower cost of labor.<p>Yes we need a basic income and support it by taxing corporations who use automated programs, AI, and robots to do the jobs that human beings used to do. Also tax the companies that use foreign labor to save on costs. It is because those companies cost native jobs when they do that.<p>Unemployment only counts those on unemployment insurance, not those who lost unemployment insurance because it ran out or those who ended up on welfare or disability because they couldn&#x27;t find work.<p>We have a lot of qualified IT workers with student loan debt who cannot find a job in this country.

9831971,comment,9830232,9831899,0,0,analog31,,,"One thing I&#x27;m familiar with, thanks to my kids, is the Suzuki method of violin instruction. Kids start out just playing by rote memorization, and by ear, with no charts. There were books for the Suzuki repertoire, more for the use of adults, as the kids didn&#x27;t read from them.<p>When I was growing up, Suzuki was controversial in the US because teachers were afraid that kids would lose the chance to learn how to read, and be musically crippled for life. I have to admit that I was among the skeptical, since I learned according to the European method.<p>The first note that I ever played, an open string, I read from a book that had that one big note sitting there in front of me. The entire emphasis was on &quot;getting the cats out of the instrument&quot; as it were, but yet it was all done with reading from the git-go.<p>What&#x27;s happened since then in the US (don&#x27;t know about elsewhere) is that reading is introduced gradually through a separate curriculum. It&#x27;s been going on for long enough that Suzuki kids are now playing professionally in orchestras, and we&#x27;ve met one or two &quot;superstar&quot; concert violinists through master classes for the kids, who have mentioned their Suzuki background.<p>So apparently you can start out without reading, and live to tell about it.",1436053814

It would help them enormously and not require austerity but there are political reasons that won&#x27;t allow it.<p>If Greece was using the drachma, this would not be a problem.<p>The other problem with austerity measures is that they have a tendency to inhibit growth or even shrink the economy; shrinking the government <i>further</i> certainly doesn&#x27;t help that situation.<p>EDIT: I forgot to add that Greece has a primary budget surplus - meaning that if it wasn&#x27;t for the debt they owe, they&#x27;d be doing fantastically budgetarily.",1436053783

9831963,comment,9831523,9831843,0,0,brendangregg,,,"Depends what user space debugger you mean...<p>Some specific advantages of uprobes:<p>- Kernel tracing with user-level context. uprobes works with the other kernel tracing frameworks, so front-ends like ftrace, perf_events, and SystemTap, can trace both user and kernel, and combine the results (especially programmatic tracers like SystemTap). Eg, let&#x27;s say we wanted disk I/O latency by database query, or scheduler run-queue latency by application request.<p>- Full user-level visibility. You may have a language runtime tracer that shows what the language is doing (and do so better than uprobes can), but not system libraries. Eg, Java burning time in a compression library, or even its own libjvm for GC, which may not be seen (in the same manner) as method tracing.<p>- It&#x27;s there by default. At my company people can run anything. So if there&#x27;s a performance issue on an application I&#x27;ve never seen before, I have one way to dig in, even if there are no other options.<p>- Some debuggers are not made for real-time production use, as they halt the target. With uprobes, we can pose a question of the running software (latency of X, arguments of Y), and answer it quickly, with relatively less overhead.<p>- It can trace system wide. (I&#x27;m not sure many other debuggers can.) Eg, you could trace libnsl calls, across all processes.<p>Some advantages of other user space debuggers:<p>- User to user tracing is more efficient than calling the kernel. LTTng has a user space implementation which beats the performance of user->kernel tracers by some factor. Some runtimes, like Java, have plenty of user-level tracing add-ons that are also much more efficient. (It&#x27;s possible, like with LTTng, that uprobes could be implemented to do user->user tracing, and combine results afterwards. I don&#x27;t know the status of this.)<p>- Custom user-level tracers (eg, with Java) can be better developed to handle the target language and context. Tracing Java methods with uprobes is extremely difficult (I have an idea of how to do it), but trivial with Java tracers designed to do that. (I should add: tracing Java native calls, like the workings of GC in libjvm, is well suited for uprobes.)",1436053693

As long as you can rank your preferences, for cats, children, or whatever, you can come up with an equivalent cardinal utility.<p>So I think Waldman&#x27;s statement is technically correct, the two are equivalent, and one isn&#x27;t more scientific than the other.<p>There is this notion that it&#x27;s bad form to say, a rich person gets less marginal utility out of a dollar than a poor person, or sum up utilities across people. And it&#x27;s bad form to quantify the value of a human life for instance.<p>You can, however, say the rich person values leisure at more dollars than the poor person.<p>If you could sum up utilities across people I&#x27;m sure it would lead one to very bad conclusions, unlike some of the other simplifications economists make, which only lead to useful conclusions. <cough> Actually, I&#x27;m not really certain what it would change, if anything.<p>In any event it would appear that humans aren&#x27;t very consistent with their preferences, c.f. behavioral economics, hence the notion of utility may lead one astray whether one views it as an ordinal ranking or cardinal quantity.",1436053532

The Text Encoding Initiative, (which doesn&#x27;t seem to be an actual encoding standard?), despite being active since the 1980s, and my own use of various markup systems since about the same time, was unknown to me:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_Encoding_Initiative"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_Encoding_Initiative</a><p>Even knowing that, it&#x27;s not clear what problem exactly TEI solves.<p>Second: what&#x27;s your goal? <i>How are you looking to use Markdown?</i><p>For offline use in your <i>own</i> document preparation activities, I think Chris answered his own question. Markdown is extensible via HTML. If you want to use <i>semantic</i> elements such as <em>emphasized text</em> or <cite>Some Famous Book</cite>, then simply include those elements within your own source document.<p>A lot of us are using Markdown on third-party sites -- for myself it turns up on Reddit, Ello, Diaspora, and StackExchange ... in a mazy of twisty passages, all different. And I really <i>don&#x27;t</i> have control over what&#x27;s parsed or supported (Ello&#x27;s lack of blockquote and Reddit&#x27;s lack of images both drive me equally nuts).<p>To a large extent, for works of a few dozen to 10,000 words, possibly even longer, <i>heading structured documents work great</i>. Markdown is just that: a quick and only slightly dirty way to create content for which presentation specification (e.g., bold and italic specs) is more than sufficient. I mean, yeah, it&#x27;s fucking wonderful that HTML has, <i>in theory</i>, all this wonderful semantic markup. Dig into the source of pretty much any site out there, with <i>very</i> few exceptions, and you&#x27;ll find they&#x27;re simply butchered. Table layouts and <font> directives for titles and headings and absolute positioning all over the page.... Or worse, custom styles which make even <i> and <b> look stunningly attractive.<p>If anything, documents tend to go to the <i>other</i> extreme: too many entities, too much markup, too much crud, too much design. To the point that I&#x27;m far too frequently scraping raw text from documents and rebuilding them (usually with Markdown) to a simple basic PDF or HTML page <i>that I can actually fucking read.</i><p>OCD, it&#x27;s a hell of a drug.<p>My suggestion: get over it.<p><i>You cannot get both a SIMPLE and a COMPLETE markup language.</i> One is the enemy of the other.<p>Settle for good enough.<p>The problems I&#x27;ve got with Markdown (or any of the other lightweight markup languages: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language</a>) is that standards aren&#x27;t, parsers and interpreters (particularly on third-party sites) vary and/or suck, and stuff I&#x27;d really like to see (superscript, subscript, footnot, ToC generators, equation support) aren&#x27;t well supported. Hell, we can&#x27;t even rely on blockquotes, images, character escaping, and superscripts being uniformly treated.<p>Use Mardown. Or switch to another LWML. And extend it with HTML. Use post-processing scripts to add those div wrappers and metadata you want (I&#x27;m basically doing the same for my own work).<p>The one other element that might make sense, and which you don&#x27;t address, is a document standard -- I&#x27;d <i>really</i> appreciate if documents had standard metadata: title, author, publication date. Something vaguely like an RFC #822 of text document metadata (and fortunately we&#x27;ve got *so many standards to choose from: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata_standards"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata_standards</a> -- Ob xkcd 927).<p>It&#x27;s also not clear how or why LaTeX itself isn&#x27;t suitable here. It&#x27;s plaintext, more structured than Markdown, yet generally easier to code than HTML.<p>I do appreciate the tip on ScholarlyMarkdown, which looks like it might address a few of my own interests.",1436052175

The author&#x27;s argument is that everybody knew that their economic state was misrepresented, so the banks should have never lend them money in the first place.<p>The mismanagement leading up to the financial crises was of course the fault of the Greek government. However, the reforms that the EU has proposed/enforced since then seem to have been more about punishing the Greeks than about actually building a properly functioning economy. That might feel justified (and because of that it has the support of many voters) but long-term it is not a viable solution to the problem.",1436051582

Chemists&#x27; free energy, or the force required to maintain the pressure differential of a vacuum, are cardinal measures of constructs as invisible as utility and with a much stronger claim to validity as &#x27;science&#x27;.&quot;<p>Utility is ordinal not out of some deep desire on the part of economists to &quot;appear scientific&quot; but because it reflects a simple empirical fact about humans. &quot;Utility&quot; is a measure of value to someone, and human values are ordinal: I value my children more than my cats, and <i>no number</i> of cats will ever equal the value of my children. It would be incoherent and wrong to say I value my children ten times more than my cats, and no cardinal relationship between them could possibly represent reality.<p>This is not mysterious or esoteric. The ordinality of human values is what makes rational choice under uncertainty such a difficult problem, because we can&#x27;t compute expected values from ordinals (unless there happens to be a market in the things we value, in which case we can get cardinality through prices... but there is no market in children or many other things we value.)<p>By making it sound like economist&#x27;s interest in publicly testing ideas by systematic observation, controlled experiment and Bayesian inference--which is what the discipline of science actually is--is some kind of inexplicable fetish instead of a perfectly reasonable goal for anyone who wants to say anything meaningful or interesting about the world, the author does everyone a great disservice.",1436050977

A lot of beautiful results are based on purely requiring laws to be self-consistent and seeing that only one possible law is self-consistent. For instance check out what Scott Aaronson says about probability in quantum mechanics. While Feynman in his famous lectures just says that quantum mechanics is counter intuitive and you are not supposed to truly understand it, Scott Aaronson uses math to explain how to correct your intuition (and I am stressing, this is not just about learning the math, it is about basing your intuition on the math, not on the everyday experience).",1436050916

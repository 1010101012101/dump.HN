I was trying to describe in a letter what I am currently doing: French would not let me. But argot lends itself very well... I am involved in an activity called “Glander”, more precisely “glandouiller”. It means “to idle”, though not “to be in a state of idleness” (it is an active verb). Gandouiller denotes enjoyment. The formal French word is “ne rien faire” (to do nothing), which misses on the active part —so do words that have a languishing connotation. Glander is what children without soccer moms do when they are out of school. It resembles flâner which has this perambulation part; though Glander does not have any strings attached. The Italians have farniente but it is really doing nothing. Even the Arabs do not have a verb for Glander: the construction takaslana from the Semitic root ksl denotes laziness (other words imply some inertia).""<p>Newton was a “glandeur”; In Dijksterhuis 2004:<p>George Spencer Brown has famously said about Sir Isaac Newton that “to arrive at the simplest truth, as Newton knew and practiced, requires years of contemplation. Not activity. Not reasoning. Not calculating. Not busy behavior of any kind. Not reading. Not talking. Not making an effort. Not thinking. Simply bearing in mind what it is that one needs to know.”<p>I Glander whenever I am bored and I come up with formulate groundbreaking ideas. Some of them are even viable for monetization!",1208321981

164870,comment,164560,164619,0,0,lux,,,"Exactly!  That's what we're doing in our own niche right now (launching in 1.5 months).  Our first phase is targeting businesses exclusively, although for now not the larger ones because those take mega time and $$$ to sell to (which is why software they buy always costs so much...).<p>Look at Basecamp and Highrise and you'll see plenty of proof that this strategy is totally viable.<p>The other huge advantage a web-based app can offer over the traditional corporate apps, which those apps can't easily compete with once you start rolling, is that there's no hardware + license fees, only a monthly service subscription.  You take the headache and high initial cost out of it, and you open these types of apps to a much wider class of businesses too.",1208320396

That said, if the Twitter guys are ""done"" with innovating, good for them, go ahead and exit!  but i hardly believe Twitter is done developing their product.  therefore, NO SALE, and the chance for Twitter to unleash a bidding war for a tiny sliver of equity such as what was engineered by Facebook.<p>- Srini Kumar\nMetaNotes.com",1208319596

164862,comment,164578,164578,0,0,oz,,,"Also, and this is absolutely important, keep a small notepad and pen(cil) nearby, and write down your ideas the instant they come. You'd be surprised how many great ideas we have and forget. Remember to note the date, and how you came up with the idea. If you're without writing tools, set a reminder in your phone to a time when you know you'll be home, but it is imperative you record it.<p>Don't be afraid if ideas come out of sequence. I'm getting into freelance graphic design, and one evening I just started writing the word 'concept' in all sorts of ways, using 'k' instead of 'c', and then drew a capital 'T' with the letters 'concep' under it. Then I thought: let's try another letter. So I drew a capital 'S', but with a straight vertical line and 2 horizontal lines instead of curves, and had 'con' down the left side and 'ept' down the right. It looked good, but I wanted to explore some more. So I tried the letter 'C', and wrote 'oncept' inside it following the shape of the 'C'. That was the first breakthrough: it looked like half of a clock. So I draw a full clock, and what do you know, the letters in 'concept correspond perfectly to the number positions on a clock face! So 12 o'clock is a 'C', 11 and 1 o'clock are 'O' etc. So I found myself with a clock with the word 'concept' on it twice... two concepts. A little more brainstorming gave me the final name ""Twin-Concept."" This is what I meant by ideas out of sequence: normally, you'd come up with the company name and then design the logo, but I was determined to use that logo, and so I named the company after the logo! The hour marks are set in green, to give it that 'glow in the dark look.' Against a black background, it's sexy.<p>Oh, and did I mention that you should write down ideas as soon as they come?",1208319172

Creative, Production, Replication, Sales, Media Purchasing, Finances, Management, Shipping, IT and Marketing all work in concert.<p>This company does it all. Finding products, producing spots, buying time on the air, duplicating and distributing video tapes and tracking sales.<p>They have an elaborate database keeping track of everything in motion. There is a minor breakdown in this system(well, there are many, but I'm focusing on this one). Replication needs work orders to copy a tape and ship it to a station.<p>These work orders are sheets of paper, in triplicate. They contain hand-copied information from the database, such as station name and address, the code of the tape, the required date of arrival and the preferred shipping method.<p>On some days, hundreds of requests come to the replication department and prioritization begins. But before triage begins the forms must be sorted.<p>Management knows about the problem. And they know it's expensive. Sorting and prioritizing takes up precious hours. With a five o'clock shipping deadline and limited VCRs, every minute you don't have a tape in a deck is a potentially large commission lost.<p>In comes IT. And requirements gathering begins. They're a hip, 'with it' bunch of guys and know how to ask the right questions. ""What are you doing?"" vs ""How do you think a computer should do it?""<p>But even that isn't enough. Pressure is on to mechanize and automate the entire department. Every other department is in the system. Why isn't replication?<p>The solution is fraught with bar codes, complex color-coded prioritization schemes and a host of other features to let replicators know in an instant: ""What tape do I make next?""<p>That system is ten years behind schedule. Has no hope of completion and most of what they really need could be implemented for a fraction of the cost.<p>What went wrong?<p>They thought of something other than the user experience. They focused on requirements. But those requirements are already met. Requests come in. Requests are prioritized. Tapes go out.<p>In their zeal to improve the efficiency of it all everybody had no sight of what they should have been doing.<p>Improving the user experience.<p>This is what they should have done. And had they been willing to listen it would have happened.<p>Simple no-brainer: stick the requests into a database. Only a minor fraction of the data on those forms was new information and a ridiculous amount of time was being wasted hand-copying it for each form.<p>Then give video technicians access to a simple column sorting view of this data.<p>Let the computer sort. Computers are good for sorting.<p>Let the humans prioritize. Humans are good for prioritizing. And the team in replication knows the infinitely complex prioritization system they use better than anybody in the world could. They know what attributes matter when, and when to escalate a time-crunch up the chain of command. What was really slowing them up was sorting hundreds of sheets of paper.<p>And there you have the vast majority of the time wasted in this process knocked out with the features more-or-less already implemented by the database in use.<p>Let other features get added on people see opportunities and say: ""Hey, wouldn't it be cool if it did ...""<p>I worked in that replication facility before I got into programming. And it has shown me changing the way think about how to use a computer is a far more daunting task than any design I'll ever come up against.",1208319150

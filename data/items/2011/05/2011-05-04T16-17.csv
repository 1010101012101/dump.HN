The iOS market has big performance differences between product updates. Various other Android tablets each having their own quirks and heck, The Playbook even having its own OS.<p>The concept I'm looking to propose would be subsidized device rentals for bundles or individual devices at a price point which Developers would pay to be able to test their projects and products at say, the last 2 weeks of development.

Everyone has ideas, everyone has time and most of us have some money to invest in our own projects. Finding a co-founder is something you can't control yourself so it's always the first big hurdle.<p>The good news is that there are a ton of people just like you having trouble finding co-founders themselves. Great ways to meet them are:<p>1. Meetups. These days, services like Meetup make it easy to find meetings of people interested in the same things you are. Whatever area you think you'd like to start a company, start going to a meetup or start your own meetup.<p>2. Classes. Class is always a great way to meet people and work together. This doesn't need to be full time school, I've met great people in night classes (even in cooking classes).<p>3. Start blogging. If you start writing about the topics that interest you and start reading blogs by other people on the same topic you'll realize who is like-minded. It's a lot easier to know someone is the right fit if you've already read their thoughts on the matter.<p>4. Join a start up. This is the best option. Join an existing start up company. They are always full of people who are smart, take risks and will probably be interested in exploring your ideas with you. You can easily find start up companies in your area by browing the sites of nearby Venture Capital funds (see their investment portfolio) or searching Crunchbase.<p>Hope this helps.",1304527521

2514356,comment,2514145,2514145,4,0,jorgeortiz85,,,"While the given approach for AtomicMap is interesting and performs well in the common case, it suffers from a few flaws: some fixable, some fundamental.<p>First, storing polymorphic values in the map (either true values or OneShotThunks, depending on whether the Thunk has been unboxed or not) means you have to give up the static type safety of the compiler and cast values carefully. There's at least two bugs in the current version of the code due to unsafe casting. However, this problem can be fixed with careful coding and thorough tests.<p>Second, the given code doesn't actually prevent thunks from executing more than once. If the thunk throws an exception when executed, the thunk will still be kept in the map and marked as ""unexecuted"", so the next thread that tries to read that value will execute it again (and possibly throw an exception again). This is troubling both because the thunk executes multiple times and because an update from one thread can cause another thread to throw an exception. This is possibly fixable with some clever coding, but it's unclear what the desired semantics should be if the thunk throws an exception. (Possibly tombstone the value or replace it with the previous value: as if the update with the throwing thunk had never happened.)<p>But a fundamental flaw in the entire approach is that AtomicMap imposes a certain kind of threading model on client code. The above-mentioned behavior of exceptions propagating to other threads is one symptom of this problem, but there are others. For example, if the thunk takes a while to execute, or worse yet blocks (either momentarily or indefinitely), then other threads interacting with the same key in the map will block waiting for the thunk to finish executing. This behavior is perhaps fine for many applications, but if you want your threads to operate with strict timeouts for blocking operations, or if you want your threads to be entirely nonblocking, then you can't safely use AtomicMap. The implementation forces a particular threading model on client code, which is deprived from choosing its own threading model.<p>Perhaps a better interface for AtomicMap to implement is ConcurrentMap[A, Future[B]]. This alternative map could still make all its operations atomic, but by returning a Future[B] (instead of a straight-up B), it gives client code the power to check whether an exception was thrown or to block with a timeout when getting the value. Then its up to the client to decide what threading model it feels most comfortable with.",1304527069

I'll expand on that point a bit, as an American person who was brought up with belief in God that was taught to me as a basis for personal morality and who no longer believes in God but still likes to follow standards of personal morality. Teaching of children in a great variety of religious organizations, not just Christian organized religions, presupposes that one rationale for morale behavior is the approval of the God or gods (or conformity with the thought of enlightened men) promoted by believers in that religion. Young children so brought up are not encouraged to consider the possibility of moral behavior on the basis of purely human, this-world considerations.<p>In my own life, I was influenced at what I think is known to be a critical age for forming group allegiances (around the time of puberty) by two boys who were my classmates in junior high. They were my two best friends at that age. Both were very smart, eventually becoming engineers who have done challenging work in their adult careers, and one was deeply devout by upbringing, while the other was militantly atheist by upbringing. It happened, I would now say by coincidence, that the devout evangelical Christian I knew among the two friends was a young man of exceptional kindness and quiet self-confidence that never crossed the line into arrogance, while the militant atheist was a young man who delighted in teasing other students (even a girl in our class with cerebral palsy) and who never hid his pride in his IQ and his secularism. The religious point of view that resulted in kinder, less arrogant behavior was appealing to me, and with the example of the two friends in mind, I became much more evangelical Christian in my outlook during my school years than I had been brought up to be.<p>Over quite a few years, including years when I was employed doing evangelistic work in another country, I have become entirely an atheist, but still very much interested in encouraging myself, and the children in my care, to be kind, non-arrogant, and willing to take on intellectual challenges. Meanwhile, my childhood evangelical Christian friend is a still an active church-goer, but now a member of a ""liberal"" denomination and certainly, as his career verifies, not at all ""fundamentalist"" in his view of science (as he once was). The formerly atheist friend is now a follower of the Baha'i religion. He seems to have mellowed out quite a bit in his middle age. I am much better acquainted these days with the first mentioned friend than the second, because the formerly atheist friend traveled to other far-away places over the years.<p>I think many people rely more than they realize on salient personal examples to form their opinions on abstract subjects such as religion. Perhaps atheists in the United States will gradually gain more acceptance as more people have personal experience with interacting with kind, thoughtful atheist friends (as I have). Because the United States population includes a large percentage of people whose ancestors settled in America specifically because of their religious commitments (as did more than half of my ancestors), religiosity probably still has a long time to go as a characteristic feature of American national culture. On my part, I think the writings of Sam Harris go a long way to helping religiously committed Americans to rethink their point of view and to be open to the possibility that morality is separable from religion.",1304525906

2514276,comment,2512410,2512410,1,0,wordchute,,,"The recording industry's bigger problem has been that for the past twenty years or more, it seems to have gotten the idea that its consumer base consists almost entirely of twelve year old girls, and at the same time the bigger companies have been absorbing or destroying all the smaller labels that actually produce the innovative music that people want to hear and  would willingly pay for. You know there's a problem when kids are saying that all the new music is garbage and listen to music that was made before their parents were born. That's not to say good music is not out there, it's just really hard to find sometimes.<p>I have heard a few owners of small labels say that they actually welcome the emerging distribution models, and if some of the music is downloaded or whatever (within reason) then that's cool too. That means that they are reaching an audience that is increasingly hard to reach, and so have the potential to find revenue by less traditional means. So while the days of super-bands are probably over, small labels and bands can actually make a decent living now doing what they love to do - producing good music that people like.<p>Consider this: most bands make their money through live performances and licensing. When you look at the total record sale for a band like the Rolling Stones versus their overall net worth, it becomes pretty apparent that, considering their percentage of the sales, they could not have made all their money by moving boxes full of vinyl, CDs or whatever. The same is true for just about every artist you've ever heard of.<p>To the irritation of the big labels, though, these new models are quickly cutting out the guys in the middle who don't really care about the quality of the music. They don't seem to get the idea that if they made an effort to produce a product that people want, then (surprise) people will but it. Instead of putting a pile of money into five ""artists"" that suck, spread it out to smaller projects that collectively do well - like the small labels do it.<p>I actually heard one of these boring suits discussing the downloading problem on a business program, and he said that if illegal downloading continued on its present course then they would no longer be able to finance all the mega-expensive music videos. All I can say to that is that we should all fire up BitTorrent and make it happen.",1304525593

Doing it this way, all spills/intermediate steps live on (very fast) ephemeral storage. Additionally, the distcp command is pretty fast since it is a distributed copy - all nodes will saturate their connections on the copy.<p>Also, the authors advice to ""make processing faster, decompress it, split it in to lots of smaller files"" is probably not the optimal way to do it. Hadoop isn't great at storing lots of small files.<p><a href=""http://www.cloudera.com/blog/2009/02/the-small-files-problem/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cloudera.com/blog/2009/02/the-small-files-problem...</a><p>I'm guessing that he gets a speedup because he is using raw s3:// as a filesystem rather than s3n://. If I understand the hadoop s3 connection, this means that hadoop will use a single connection to pull a single file - so a single 10GB file will max out a single node's network connection and the rest will go unused. Splitting the file up into 1 million line blocks lets multiple nodes pull simultaneously. But storing files using the s3n:// allows this anyway, and results in large files being split into 64mb blocks. It also allows you to store files larger than 5GB, or whatever the s3 file size limit is.<p>Now, a question I'd really like to know the answer to.

The issue is, when you have a relatively small webapp that you want to be <i>fast</i>. It's large and fancy enough -- you just want it to be fast.<p>So, for that you want a persistent language runtime, such that when your page gets accessed the <i>already running</i> Python interpreter just grabs your .pyc file and runs it immediatly.<p>The final ingredient is that with php you can put your php files into your docroot so that you don't even have to mess with apache rewrite.<p>If Python had those things, there wouldn't be any reason for a new user to choose php over python.",1252875341

It doesn't have pattern matching for selective receive, IIRC, and doesn't enforce lack of local state, but is otherwise mostly there. It implements lightweight processes  via Lua coroutines, which are cheap <i>co-operative</i> mini-threads, the other concurrency model that (IMHO) makes sense.<p>I've played with it a bit and it seems well-designed, but at the time I hadn't done much serious with Erlang, and felt it would make more sense to learn the Erlang idioms (supervisor trees, etc.) <i>from Erlang itself</i> and come back to ConcurrentLua later. I'm very interested in it, though - Lua is one of my favorite languages.<p>It also seems to be the work of one grad student, who since graduated (and may have moved on). OTOH, it's a rather small project, since Lua (as with Scheme and Termite) already provides most of the necessary infrastructure in the core language (it's mostly a scheduling wrapper for coroutines and some distribution primitives), so forking it wouldn't be terribly difficult.",1252875182

The color issue is that there are a only a few phosphors in the bulb, and so all of the light coming out is at just a few discrete wavelengths.  An incandescent produces a smooth combination of all wavelengths in the visible range.  The light from a fluorescent looks like the right color on a white surface, but many dyes reflect specific wavelengths of light.  This means that colors under even good fluorescent lights look different than under incandescent or daylight.  LEDs have the exact same problems.",1252874634

This is so ignorant coming from a brilliant man. Organic or conventional farming isn't the issue. The way most Americans consume meat 3 times a day is the issue. It would be like having a debate on oil consumption in this country and two people were arguing about heating homes with oil and nobody ever brought up transportation. Eating meat 3 times a day isn't sustainable. Organic farming is. The way this debate is framed is just beyond stupid for how intelligent the people having it are. Everyone just assumes that meat 3 times a day is ok and it's the organic farming that isn't sustainable. This is laughable.<p>This isn't an all or nothing thing here. Eating meat in moderation is fine. This country (American) has a taste for federally subsidized, extremely cheap and unhealthy meat. That is the issue. Not farming.",1252874409

His issue was that first-world people shouldn't completely abandon the advancement of genetically-modified food as it doesn't agree with their views of how food should be grown.<p>Most of us can buy organic food I would imagine, and it usually does taste better. But we shouldn't force our ideals of what others should and should not eat when organic is not a viable option, and <i>any</i> food is better than tastier food. That was Borlaug's message.",1252873237

It just so happens that this means buying organic most of the time.<p>There really are two very different problems.  One is how to we feed lots and lots of people in poor parts of the world and the other is how can rich spoiled people like myself get the best tasting vegetables.  The solution to these two problems probably isn't the same.",1252873039

I agree with Borlaug about nitrogen fertilizer; we can't replace it efficiently.  But I also have qualms about the over-use of pesticides and fertilizer; air and water pollution; decreasing genetic diversity of industrially farmed food (probably the primary reason why organic produce tastes better, in practice); and dependence upon a global supply chain that requires massive amounts of energy, and that leads to perverse nutritional incentives.  Don't get me started on non-vegetable farming....<p>I think a lot of claims coming from organic fetishists are off the deep end, but they're not entirely wrong.

What I'd really like is something that does the following (while complimenting the ticket tracking system we're using):<p>Allows everyone on the team to see what everyone else is working on at a glance. No scrolling through a feed (any discussion about what they are working on would happen after a click away from the default view). I would also be able to set what they are working on as the product manager which might simply be a reference to a ticket number in Lighthouse.<p>Since this would be a real-time application it would be nice if the team could have instant chats as well, at any time.<p>Why would any of this matter if our ticket tracking system is working fine? Well, not everyone on the team is a developer and they tend to stay away from Lighthouse unless they really have to log in. Designers, marketing folks, and the higher ups still want to know what's going on and in some cases it's my job to assign them tasks. I can't expect them to use a tool that's geared towards developers, especially because all they want is a very fast view of what's happening now.<p>I really hope I'm describing a tool that already exists. My hope is there is a native Mac/Windows application that supports this, but browser based would work I suppose.",1252872817

Eval is considered harmful for a similar reason as to why GOTO is: it makes code harder to prove and to manipulate. Markup and data on one end of the spectrum can be endlessly manipulated, analyzed, and worked with. As we move up the power spectrum, we get to regular languages, stack languages, and finally Turing-completeness. Within Turing-completeness, though, there are still varying levels of how hard something is to work with. Yes, the halting problem means that you can't for any behavior determine whether an arbitrary program exhibits that behavior, but there are still subsets about which you can reason.",1252872423

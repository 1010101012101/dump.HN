A risk to human life isn&#x27;t the only threshold that determines retaliation. A risk to economic activity is just as provocative as physical violence. How about if they attacked the power grid? A huge number of companies&#x27;s businesses depend on services like github. Do we just hold hands and choose to pray for a solution or do we hit the perpetrators in the gut? If the Chinese are behind it, we should immediately start seizing their US assets until such time as they put an end to the nonsense. If the Chinese can thwart Google, they sure as hell have the means to stop a cyber attack from their soil: even if they are directly the ones doing it. Alternatively, their cables could be cut (there are only about 7 that connect China with the outside Internet.) if someone is spraying you with a firehouse, cutting off their water supply is a just and reasonable response.",1427666363

I do not think it means what you think it means.&quot;<p>As terrible as I, too, think this decision was, it was a decision by a <i>trial</i> court judge. &quot;Precedents&quot; don&#x27;t attach to trial court decisions, only to appellate court decisions.<p>If Restis appeals, and the dismissal is upheld by the appellate courts, <i>then</i> there will be a precedent, with everything that implies. Similarly, if he appeals and the dismissal is reversed, a much more favorable (to your and my tastes, anyway) precedent will attach, which can be used to argue against any other attempts to toss suits to which the government isn&#x27;t even a party on the basis of the State Secrets Privilege.<p>For the moment, however, this is an &quot;isolated&quot; incident, and can&#x27;t be used precedentially in any similar cases.<p>EDIT: Yes, follow-ups, there are other definitions of the word &quot;precedent&quot;.

Part of the process for implementing changes to laws is to think about the ramifications it may have on businesses. If a country changes a law so that foreign businesses do not want to do business in that country anymore then that is a consequence that the country will have to deal with. It is not up to an international tribunal to decide that the people of said country actually prefer jobs rather than the changes made to the law.

9286598,comment,9285377,9286540,0,0,danbruc,,,"I just had a look at the definitions again. The presented log buffer implementation is neither wait-free, nor lock-free, nor obstruction-free because one failed writer will prevent the progress of any other thread unconditionally, in consequence this is accurately described as a blocking algorithm. To just quote from Wikipedia »[...] an algorithm is called non-blocking if failure or suspension of any thread cannot cause failure or suspension of another thread [...]« which is obviously not the case because a failed writer will cause all subsequent writes to fail, i.e. the writers will happily fill the buffer but the messages never really make it into the buffer in a way that the reader can see them.<p>In case of the SPSC queue the requirement is that the writer must be able to enqueue new items no matter what the reader does and the reader must be able to dequeue all items for which the enqueue operation succeeded no matter what the writer does afterwards. The presented queue implementation meets this requirements. If the writer fails between steps 4 and 5 the write did not succeed and it does not matter that the reader can not see the item.<p>What you say about keeping the data structure usable for other threads seems correct to me.<p>You must not confuse lock-free and not using a lock, these are two different things. An algorithm using locks is a blocking algorithm but using locks is only sufficient, not mandatory. If no process can block other processes unconditionally the algorithm is non-blocking and obstruction-free, lock-free and wait-free are different progress guarantees for non-blocking algorithms in ascending order of strength.<p>One last point, if you try to obtain a lock and fail to do so you are considered blocked, no matter if you spin, suspend the thread or do unrelated things to waste some time until retrying later.",1427665345

Maybe I have misinterpreted.<p>So if &quot;killed mid-operation&quot; must be supported then I don&#x27;t see how many algorithms can be said to make progress. Take for example the Lamport SPSC queue[1], if the producer gets killed mid operation between steps 4 and 5 of the push operation. Then the data is in the queue but the consumer is blocked from ever seeing it with this line of reasoning. The Lamport SPSC queue is considered wait-free by the concurrency community I know. I base my reasoning on this. What if the producer takes a pause for a long time between steps 4 and 5 before continuing?<p>However if to be wait-free an algorithm must allow all other threads to continue using the data structure, not just continue making progress in other ways by being non-blocking and completing in a finite number of steps, then I stand corrected.<p>If wait-free must include coping with any thread being killed mid operation is there a term for being lock-free but also having all threads not block and complete in a finite number of steps for their interaction with the algorithm?<p>[1] - <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.1824.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.1824.pdf</a>",1427664246

9286469,comment,9283571,9285402,0,0,amit-bansil,,,"I cannot imagine creating any sort of complex system that does not, at some conceptual level, contain cycles. What I am suggesting is that the author of a complex system should, whenever possible, untangle as many of these cycles as possible by differentiating between the different classes of references. Think of it like the difference between your directory tree and your symbolic links in unix.<p>Reg. your example, I have generally found it effective to model UI hierarchies where the top level components refer to their children &#x27;strongly&#x27; while the children refer &#x27;weakly&#x27; to their parents. I am not familiar with the recent smart pointer stuff in c++ but I believe that these concepts have been cleanly modeled with abstractions such as this:<p><a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/weak_ptr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/weak_ptr</a><p>N.B. A more difficult conundrum that I have encountered when dealing with UI hierarchies is whether or not child components should require a constant reference to their parent passed upon creation or you should be able to &#x27;reparent&#x27; or even be in an initial parentless case. My current thinking is that this is a mistake and interactions such as drag and drop are better handled by sending a gesture up to your data layer which then regenerates the component in its new place. This might get ugly, however, if you have a heavily direct manipulation based UI which doesn&#x27;t really need a data layer on top.<p>By the way, what has lead you down the road of UI toolkits? They are a fetish of mine. Feel free to shoot me an email if you&#x27;d like to connect.",1427663049

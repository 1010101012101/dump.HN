'In my experience, the only thing we've seen these growth patterns [in] before is in population growth studies--where there's some sort of resource constraint that results in this model.' The site, he suggests, is becoming like a community where resources have started to run out.""<p>That's an interesting observation. The other time I have seen a growth curve like that is observing the growth of homeschooling in the United States from the 1980s through the 1990s<p><a href=""http://learninfreedom.org/homeschool_growth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learninfreedom.org/homeschool_growth.html</a><p>to the present. The scarce resource is parents who feel they have enough time to homeschool their children. That resource is not completely exhausted, but the growth of homeschooling in the United States follows the resource-constrained S-shaped curve model much better than an exponential, bigger-is-always-better model. It appears that the resource constraint now on Wikipedia is new editors willing to work with the existing editors. That resource isn't exhausted yet either, but it is scarce and limited, and thus Wikipedia's growth rate has slowed.",1250204353

As soon as you propose to limit/expand the freedoms of one special interest group, all of them swarm out of the woodwork.<p>The problem is also that you cannot say ""this is crossing the boundary"" without first defining what the boundary is.

761925,comment,761589,761589,0,0,tptacek,,,"My take is that half of this Guardian article makes an important observation about Wikipedia, and the other half tries to relitigate the whole idea of Wikipedia.<p>The important half: the WP I immersed myself into in 2007 was decidedly less hospitable than the image WP tries to craft for itself. There are two forces I saw that were dragging the project down: editing-as-sport (which, guilty as charged, yes) and status seeking.<p>pg, I think, got a faceful of the editing-as-sport problem when he looked at the articles on HN/YC topics. WP editors are encouraged to tag first and ask questions later; there's volumes and reams and bookcases and crap-tons of policy and process designed to handle those tags. However, a very vocal subset of WP users will both tag-first, and also take a personal interest in the outcome of those discussions. So if an article is AfD'd (put up for deletion) for notability concerns, and the article's a ""Keep"", you can bet the {{Notability}} tag is staying and every edit is going to be contested until some face-saving reorganization of the topic emerges (for instance, an omnibus ""Y Combinator"" article with subsections for pg and Blackwell).<p>The supposed nurturing atmosphere of the all-volunteer encyclopedia is meanwhile torpedoed by the status-seeking quest for adminship, in which clued-in editors are all too aware that every dispute they engage in is a contest to win or lose credibility in a future WP debate over whether they can put the gold star of adminship on their pages.<p>There are rationales for both these phenomenon, which I don't want to go into (rms apparently already thinks I'm a total message board geek for WP), but I'll just say that that part of the controversy over WP I think is real and valid.<p>The second half of the debate here is over deletionism vs. inclusionism. Here I'm less concerned. There is obviously a pervasive misunderstanding about the concept of ""notability"" and the overall goal of the Wikipedia project. Wikipedia is not the Hitchhiker's Guide. A decision was made long before the Guardian ever noticed WP that, in order to keep the project focussed, topics would be included or excluded based on an acid test of ""Notability"".<p>""Notability"" in the WP sense isn't subjective. You're notable if reliable sources have written about you. You're not notable if they haven't. The definition of ""reliable source"" is pretty expansive; my impression is that it goes up to and including ""blogs lots of people have heard of"". It certainly includes the entire mainstream media.<p>You can argue that, because WP isn't paper, you should be able to include anything in it, including a ""who's who"" of everyone who's ever posted code to Freshmeat. You can argue that, but it's pointless to do so. That argument came and went many years ago, and it's settled. The who's-who will have to live under some other domain.",1250204020

761812,comment,761767,761767,0,0,grellas,,,"Convertible notes are great bridge instruments that, in practice (at least in my experience), do not create any particular friction between the bridge investors and the later angels or VCs who fund the qualifying round forcing conversion. VCs typically accept the 20% differential without any problem. A bigger practical problem in my experience are bridge investors who push for an even larger discount. On this point, founders just need to hold a firm line.<p>The biggest practical problem with these notes from the bridge investor's side is what happens if the startup finds an exit path before a qualified funding round occurs. In the worst case, such investors effectively find themselves in a position where they get only their money back with a little interest - and all for having taken the largest funding risk of all (not quantitatively but qualitatively, since the early bridge money comes in at the point where the startup is at its most under-developed).<p>The problem is mitigated by putting in provisions for a so-called ""merger premium"" - that is, a 2x (or some other multiple) payout in the event of a liquidation that occurs before a qualified funding. This is not a perfect solution, but it helps. I have also seen the opposite problem here, where bridge investors demand a ""merger premium"" that becomes almost extortionist - this only works, of course, if the startup is utterly despairing for cash (which does happen from time to time).<p>That said, the utility of such notes is beyond question. The problem of a premature value put on a startup's stock based on an arms-length investment is huge. It messes up option grants to early-stage people. It enhances tax risks for the founders if a valuation is done too closely to the time of the founder grants. And it puts the company in a position where it needs to start doing 409A valuations at a time when money is particularly tight and they can least afford to part with the cash needed to do them. The convertible note eliminates all of these problems with a pretty elegant solution. That is why it has become a staple in the startup world.<p>Such a note can also be prepared at the cost of a few thousand dollars max in a typical case, which is another plus that gives it large appeal among founders looking for bridge solutions to their funding needs.",1250201475

Right now, the rapid development of ever-higher-bandwidth connections tends to favor centralization of computing power (though there's still good reason for a lot of it to be localized in the laptop and cellphone).<p>With electrical power, the economics have long been mostly in favor of centralization. This started shifting a little with the development of ever-cheaper solar panels, and would shift a lot more were any sort of effective localized power storage possible. And unlike bits, there is a transmission loss for watts.<p>Though I'm dubious that this technology will ever see the market. When it's for sale to the consumer, then I'll know it's real.",1250201085

At this point, you cant go by the Mark Cuban book.  Dont try to duplicate what he did.

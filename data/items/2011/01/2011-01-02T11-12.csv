2059903,comment,2059452,2059892,0,0,jrockway,,,"Incidentally, I work at a bank, and to get access remotely you have to have a randomly-generated username, a random password, and a client-side certificate.  The VPN software denies all outgoing connections except to port 80 (and the VPN port, I guess) when it is not active.  When it is active, it makes all the network interfaces that aren't the VPN disappear (so you can't see your link-level network anymore).  Then, it asks for your password every 24 hours.<p>Usually I find the commute to work less stressful.<p>But it does show you that some organizations do take data security seriously... perhaps too seriously.  (The port blocking is just security theater.  I can run whatever I want over port 80.  But the random username / random password / client-side SSL certificate is excellent security.)",1293969080

2059897,comment,2059739,2059860,0,0,danparsonson,,,"I think the key is in the line ""Modifying behaviors at lower levels automatically improves behaviors at higher levels"". Of course you're only making visible progress towards writing your novel when you're actually writing, but if getting to bed earlier enables you to write more in a day (say, because you have more productive time available to you - some people work better in the mornings) then your novel-writing goal is accelerated by your getting-to-bed-earlier goal.  Hence 'leverage'.",1293968746

Not sure how it works/will work now that ESTA has entirely replaced the visa waiver cardboard thing; I'll be finding out in February.)

Hint: while they will try very hard, do not count on government or NGOs coming in with plenty of supplies particularly quickly. ARC emphasizes being prepared for 72 hours without aid, and I think this is a lowest-common-denominator strategy. It will take longer when there is serious infrastructure damage, even assuming that everything goes to plan.<p>One of my major concerns with the prepper community though is that they frequently overemphasize your own property. The most common type of disaster to affect people, by a huge margin, is home fire. <i>The most likely disaster to happen to you is your house burning down.</i> So while stocking supplies in your house is a great idea, do not take it too far: be sure that you absolutely minimize irreplaceable items in your home. If your house burns down, have a plan for where you will go for temporary housing, make sure that you will be able to access money for food (don&#x27;t keep it all under your mattress!), etc. Have a longer-term plan for smooth economic recovery. Important documents like deeds and titles are almost certainly safer in a bank vault than in your own home because of the careful fireproofing of these vaults. Anything of that sort that you keep in your home should be kept in some sort of fire safe (which should be watertight as well), but be aware that a cheap First Alert fire box will only be rated for less than one hour of exposure and probably won&#x27;t last that long. You need to spend a lot of money for something with good fire durability.",1452837546

Even if you try to make the distinction between high-level input -> low-level output, in the end it feels like the language matters much less than how the generated code is designed. Most &quot;transpilers&quot; end up using the bare minimum number of features for the target language and staying constrained to a pretty low-level part of that language. For example, languages that transpile to JavaScript tend to target asm.js, which really doesn&#x27;t look anything like the JavaScript that real people write. Getting bogged down in naming differences when the overall process is pretty much identical is just ignoring the big picture in my mind.",1452837477

Weekly tempo-setting meetings to go over status and adjust planning as needed.<p>Plans are made with broad brush strokes and are expected to be fluid and details are figured out during development. Planning sets goals, and are used to time box the work (even if the boxes are different sizes, so no adherence to stupid 2-week one size fits all sprints). Pre-planning makes it easy to get stakeholder buy-in without having to go into deep philosophical development notions. Ad-hoc communications and <i>gasp</i> my involvement with the teams covers 90% of the rest and if major problems occur, the appropriate parties are pulled into a meeting to discuss and resolve.<p>My teams are pretty consistently the most productive performers in my organization, use the fewest people and resources, and produce the highest quality product at the end of the day. As a result, my teams are consistently in demand to work on things, and once they&#x27;re out of my hands and back into some scrummaster&#x27;s their performance goes back to normal.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed an inverse correlation on all of these metrics the more &quot;Agile/Scrum&quot; the teams seem to be. Between standups, retrospectives, scrums, and whatever activities the other groups get mired down in, the consistent complaint is that nobody seems to have time to actually get anything done.<p>The problem is that Agile is supposed to be about liberating teams from process and tools and documentation and so on and focus on people and product. However, the Industry that&#x27;s exploded around &quot;Agile&quot; has simply created another pile of rigid processes that bring everybody back to square one again. Even worse, most people in the industry are so young they think this is better than what the old fuddy-duddies greybeards used to do and don&#x27;t have the perspective to realize they&#x27;ve just become trapped in another set of process ceremonies that get applied to everything without regard to the nature of the task at hand.<p>I just got out of sitting in another team&#x27;s sprint planning meeting and they spent 2 hours trying to figure out how to fit O&M and R&D into their next sprints...30 minutes of which was spent figuring out how to model the Epics.<p>Agile is a great idea in theory.

[1] A whole passenger car with amenities can weigh less than 3000 pounds. Call 1/5th of that QoL stuff, for 600lbs. Changes in automobile weight matter <i>much</i> more because automobiles stop and go much more often.<p>So the human QoL stuff probably doesn&#x27;t weigh more 1% of the road weight. But the kicker is, it doesn&#x27;t even matter too much if the QoL stuff weighs 10%, because energy use scales mostly by air resistance, not weight. [2]<p>Most of the QoL energy waste is found in idling semis at truck stops or in traffic, so this could definitely be reduced by Auto-Semis [3]<p>The eventual savings from Auto-Semis will be in reduced wages, and possibly in reduced fuel usage - but the reduced fuel consumption would come from driving slower, as you don&#x27;t have to pay a driver for their time, and an Auto Semi can drive all night.<p>I&#x27;m sure logistic companies would love to save this much money, but the capital expenditure required will be huge. Some research from passenger self driving cars would be pertinent, and probably most sensor devices, but they would be put to slightly different uses - you want a longer range view in a truck for braking distance and crash avoidance.<p>The reason I put the estimate so far out is liability and regulation and the cap ex mentioned above. Some classes of load will probably never be pulled by auto-semi: dangerous, time Sensitive, some luxury goods.<p>Auto Semis could also do some interesting things like draft (tailgate) safely and form a &quot;train&quot; of trucks.

Just today OpenSSH (which is neither Linux nor GNU but which you would obviously use on your FSF laptop) announced an extraordinarily serious remotely exploitable vulnerability. That&#x27;s presumably not the last vulnerability of that severity in an operating system you install today onto your FSF laptop.<p>It&#x27;s not obvious that FDE will totally mitigate hard drive firmware attacks because your boot loader and kernel are likely running from an unauthenticated partition (for instance, most Linux-based systems with LUKS today have all of /boot on a separate non-LUKS partition, and something like a GRUB boot sector too). If the hard drive understood how to recognize the kernel in /boot, it could inject a vulnerability into it. In a few presentations a couple of years ago, I walked through a real example of how a single bit flip in a binary can introduce (or re-introduce) a fencepost error that can compromise security, because the opcodes for extremely similar yet different conditional branches often differ by a single bit. One form of the conditional branch like jump-if-less may be the correct invariant, while another form like jump-if-less-or-equal may be the exploitable erroneous form of the same loop.<p>I&#x27;m not knocking people&#x27;s work on trying to get a handle on what firmware is running on their devices; I think that work is great. The trouble is that attackers are looking for exploits and persistence in every layer of the system, so you won&#x27;t get a silver bullet against all attacks by shoring up one aspect.<p>Good stuff on this: Halvar Flake&#x27;s &quot;Why Johnny Can&#x27;t Tell if He is Compromised&quot;, and Joanna Rutkowska&#x27;s recent CCC presentation on persistent state.",1452834566

My drive home tonight was a pleasant, breezy, 45-minute cruise covering <i>2 freaking miles of road</i>, in which I was nearly hit at least twice -- once by a crazed/enraged driver who flipped an erratic u-turn from one busy lane into my lane going the opposite direction; and once by a driver who decided that a red light was just a suggestion. These are not uncommon occurrences. And they are happening a lot more frequently. At times I feel like Han Solo navigating an asteroid field.<p>As for me? I&#x27;ll trust the future to swarms of interconnected, cross-communicating AI cars over a random, haphazard swarm of humans any day of the week. The cars can think and operate together. We just think about ourselves. We can&#x27;t <i>possibly</i> take all of the data on the road into account as well as connected cars will eventually be able to. I don&#x27;t know what they can do right this second, but I am very optimistic about what they&#x27;ll be able to do in the not-too-distant future.",1452834104

Here&#x27;s what I replied over there:<p>Thanks for pointing that out. I agree that from a technical standpoint this is not the same as a Philips Hue bulb or light strip. If you look at it from a users point of view, all Philips Hue is a lamp that you control the Brightness and Hue of. This gives you that functionality.\nNo Zigbee protocol.\nTrue, but in the context of HomeKit/HAP-NodeJS, does it matter how the bridge talks to the light? I might as well be using 433MHz transceivers, nRFs, or directly controlling the Raspberry Pi&#x27;s GPIOs. For that matter, ZigBee would be doable too, but I don&#x27;t know enough about the protocol to see it&#x27;s benefits.\nNo smart mesh network where each device extends your coverage.\nTrue, but a mesh network can be implemented with ESP8266. But if my whole house has WiFi, I don&#x27;t see the point.\nNo possible compatibility with either Phillips&#x27; Hue bridge, Hue remotes, or any other kind of Hue hardware (like Phillips&#x27; Hue+Ambilight TV&#x27;s).\nActually, using the Philips Hue shim in Homebridge, I believe it should be possible to make it compatible to Hue bridge.\nMy motivation behind making this was to prove that with ESP8266 based projects, you don&#x27;t need to have a clunky web UI or a custom app. This lamp can be controlled with any app that support HomeKit. Philips Hue was just the most similar commercial product I could think of.\nBtw, HAP-nodeJS can be completely eliminated here by using nRF51/52 BTLE chips. They can emulate the HomeKit API and control the NeoPixels both in one chip, so no bridge necessary!",1452834075

So I'm not sure they wouldn't considering hitting military or economic targets today.<p>They also got a few cruise missiles in response to the first two attacks, and they got a massive war in response to 9/11. That kind of speaks to how much more effective hitting big civilian targets is for the terrorists than the military and economic ones, but I don't think we can just shrug this off because they've changed course a bit.<p>(I don't personally believe that hitting Iraq was a <i>good</i> response to 9/11, but you can't argue that if 9/11 hadn't happened Bush would have had any public support to invade Iraq. Without 9/11 there is no Iraq war. With 9/11 and a different president, I doubt there is an Iraq war then either)",1291643615

- Book 1 is an account of his driving trip along the route of the great wall from near Beijing to the Western deserts and steppes, the people he meets, and the towns he visits. 
- Book 2 is an account of his experiences in the village of Sancha where he bought a house and came to know a family with dreams of setting up an inn and restaurant. Eventually the village becomes a suburb of Beijing and the family gets wealthier and wealthier, at a price.
- Book 3 is an account of his experiences in the town of Lishui, a small city on the way to becoming a major manufacturing center. The focus is on a couple of entrepreneurs who set up a factory that makes bra rings.<p>Besides the excellent writing style, what I liked about this book is that it focused on ordinary people and their hopes and dreams. It was impossible to avoid mentioning corruption of small time party leaders, but it didn't dwell on them. It was the first book about China I've read that didn't make the country seem like a dark menace or an unstoppable economic dynamo.",1291643069

I just wonder how many things that weren't targets yesterday are now targets today. I live near a nuclear powerplant, but I wouldn't necessarily consider it a target because it is just one of hundreds, why target this one? I'm sure there is security on it, but I don't worry about it much.<p>But what if it was on the list and it said that it was critical for the distribution of power in the whole northeast region because there is a flaw in the power distribution system. Now this relatively obscure nuclear plant is high on the list of targets and its security has to be increased a lot.<p>The same goes for chemical plants, oil refineries, etc. Can you tell me which one of the hundreds of DuPont factories manufactures chemicals for weapon systems and which ones manufactur nylon for disposable table clothes? Probably not before this leak, but I bet you can guess it now.<p>I don't see why that is helpful to anybody. I would have been suspicious of people snooping around any chemical factory, but now all of a sudden the terrorists can hit the most valuable one.<p>To me, that is pretty lame.",1291643053

People with morals and ethics (you hope).<p>Sure, those with power are corrupt and do things that most of us wouldn't approve of.<p>But when things go too far, someone with a brain often leaks it. And those leaks have a purpose - to stop whatever that is happening from happening.<p>Wikileaks is really dangerous to those kind of important, targeted leaks. These leaks in my opinion are more damaging to the government than helpful to the people keeping the government in check. I think most people who are shocked, SHOCKED! by the stuff in this leak just haven't been paying close attention, I have yet to see anything that wasn't already speculated about in the media aside for little tiny details (like this list).<p>So this leak isn't all that valuble to the population, but it scares the crap out of the government. And so we're going to get a bunch of laws designed to prevent this from happening again and make it far more dangerous and difficult for people to leak in the future.<p>I always viewed Wikileaks as the escape hatch. If you are working on something you think is objectionable and need to leak and it is impossible to get word out, send your leak to Wikileaks and they'll keep you safe and get it to the media.<p>Now Wikileaks to me is just taking a shotgun approach and really missing the point that leaks, when done well, are extremely powerful for stopping bad things from happening.

The computation is actually quite fast, most of the time is spent in retrieving the text metrics (put each word in a span, retrieve width and move on to the next word.)

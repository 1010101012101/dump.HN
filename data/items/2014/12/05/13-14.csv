And since it can be updated through Play, Google can ship new features independent of Android releases. Some say good (I do). Some might label it as a trojan horse... for Hangouts.<p>2) For Lollipop, carriers choose between the classic AOSP Messaging app and this one, Messenger.<p>3) Hangouts suspiciously has not received the Material Design treatment.<p>4) Google is holding Material Design hostage to get Messenger onto the phone as the default SMS/MMS app, possibly to deliver an even more integrated Hangouts later.<p>5) Wonder if Messenger is part of the Google app preload required to get the Play Store on the device?",1417787876

This is bad code, it doesn&#x27;t describe what you want to achieve, it&#x27;s difficult to track and analyze, it&#x27;s hard to tell when it stops. You really should want recursion here.<p>Thanks for the warning :)  It felt much cleaner, my code for the one like above:<p><pre><code>    $documents = $start_ids;\n    foreach ($documents as $id) {\n        $sub_ids = getChildren($id, 1);\n        // Now filter out any which appear in $stop_ids\n        $sub_ids = array_diff($sub_ids, $stop_ids);\n        $documents = array_merge($documents, $sub_ids);\n    }\n    print_r($documents);\n</code></pre>\nAnd the one with recursion:<p><pre><code>    $documents = $start_ids;\n    foreach ($start_ids as $id) {\n        recurse($id, $documents);\n    }\n    print_r($documents);\n    \n    function recurse($id, &$documents)\n    {\n        global $stop_ids;\n\n        $sub_ids = getChildren($id);\n        // Now filter out any which appear in $stop_ids\n        $sub_ids = array_diff($sub_ids, $stop_ids);\n        $documents = array_merge($documents, $sub_ids);\n    \n        foreach ($sub_ids as $sid) {\n            recurse($sid, $documents);\n        }\n    }\n\n</code></pre>\n> And it&#x27;s not &quot;pass by reference&quot; here. References have nothing to do.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this terminology used in PHP - describing &#x27;foreach&#x27; as &quot;pass by copy&quot; to make it clear that you can alter the argument and it won&#x27;t affect the loop, as a copy was made when foreach was run.

But there are a number of risks inherent in joining a grad program -- ways that students fall out and don&#x27;t get their degrees. At least I think you need to be aware of those risks and willing to absorb them. And one of those risks is that you emerge with your PhD and folks wonder how you&#x27;re actually smarter than you were without one.<p>(2), yes, but it&#x27;s just a reminder to set a bar for yourself, that you have to get into a decent program with decent support in order for it to be worthwhile. It might not be so much the principle of getting paid to work, but having enough of a financial cushion so you don&#x27;t have to deal with crises by quitting grad school.<p>I obeyed criterion (1) but not Feynman level. That&#x27;s too strong of a criterion, like you suggest. Rather, the alternatives to grad school all looked pretty blah. I&#x27;ve been _extremely_ lucky. My thesis project was very much a hackathon in optics, electronics, software, etc. Today I work for a company that makes scientific instruments, and I work on assimilating new technologies on a 1 - 2 year time frame before we attempt to develop them into the next generation of products. So I do a lot of experimenting, learning theory, etc. I solve difficult problems that crop up with our products, in production and in the field.<p>Truth be told, I also spend a reasonable amount of time on mainstream work, e.g., project engineering. I&#x27;ve tried my hand at both project management and people management. Those were OK. I don&#x27;t have enough mental organization to do the project management thing when I&#x27;m actually competing with other project managers for resources.<p>Over the duration of grad school, I kinda lost interest in basic research. It&#x27;s cool, but I&#x27;m not a _great_ physicist, and I&#x27;ve simply never had an idea for my own line of research, which would kinda put a damper on an academic career. I prefer to work on shorter term projects where I can add value by developing an understanding of how things work. I also feel that the industry I&#x27;m in genuinely creates good solid jobs for people. I don&#x27;t face the dilemma of wondering if I have to exploit people in order for my own work to progress.",1417786523

They even had to open an official &quot;Academy&quot; project to train artists and writers in order to sustain production; most Disney comic books published in Europe and South America were actually produced in Italy, back in the 80s and 90s.<p>One of the reasons for the popularity of such a format outside the US is the way the comic book market developed after the 60s. In the US, superhero comics built a parallel distribution system with dedicated stores; this system catered to hardcore superhero fans but not to the mainstream. Mainstream comics were mostly relegated to syndicated strips, a format that privileges simple joke-based comedy. Also, in the US most &quot;newsagents&quot; are actually convenience stores with a magazine rack; in Europe, this is very different: every town has (or used to have) a centrally-located, fully-dedicated newsagent stocking as much as it can of every publication under the sun. Press distribution is often regulated by law in much stricter terms than in the US.

Conversely, recent bookings won&#x27;t have had a chance for the rebooking to happen, so again a wave of brand new bookings will skew the number unfairly.<p>Ultimately, I think we settled on the &quot;right&quot; decision: cap the time frame, and frame it not as a &quot;rebooking rate&quot; but a &quot;1 month rebooking rate&quot;: i.e., &quot;what percentage of new bookings have a re-booking within 1 month?&quot; That one will always generate a correct number, but the disadvantage is your cohort is at least one month old.<p>So, the same issue applies here with divorce.

As a result, we can only reliably calculate this percentage for the cohort of couples who married 50+ years ago.  We have many reasons to assume that couples marrying now, or who married ten years ago, will not divorce at the same rate as those who married 50 years ago.  As another poster says, we can estimate based on historical comparisons and other data.  The NY Times article referenced in the link shows some of that: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/04/upshot/how-we-know-the-divorce-rate-is-falling.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/04/upshot/how-we-know-the-div...</a>.

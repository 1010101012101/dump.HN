'I'm pleased to note that a lot of people have realized that taking part in the iPhone (and other locked down mobile devices) ecosystem is sharecropping': please do tell. what are the 'other ways'? ...""</i><p>Games: In the days prior to consoles, the Web the only way you could get games was by going to the store and buying them in a box. But some smart folks worked out a way to by-pass the stores and go direct. Id software teaming up with Apogee to avoid sharecropping their product on the shelves of computer stores.<p>Web: When the web came along it was difficult to set up a web server, web page or forum for most in the early days. Geeky types could sidestep places like geocities for web-pages and AOL for access by getting their own machines, building their own Linux stacks connecting to ISPs and hosting their own web services.<p>Blog: If you don't want to be reliant on commercial services like MT or even the free ones like Wordpress there is nothing stopping you getting your own machine with a full stack of software using your own software. Dave Winer does this at <a href=""http://scriping.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scriping.com</a><p>You don't need to be in the system to use it. For each example I've given above users had the choice to work entirely within the restricted stack and somehow subvert it.  The big problem here is while the Internet is open the telephone/wireless system is not. But if enough people. companies build systems with a workaround even this won't be as much a problem at some time in the future.  In the case of the iPhone you can just as easily create a iPhone interface via open technologies and you are not locked into Apple. A combination of technology problems and mindset.",1258174678

After all, having a brain hasn't stopped us from learning about the brain, even though one might think it would be hard to learn about brains with brains.",1258174198

http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=653655<p>Just wanted to let you know that in big part thanks to some ideas I've got here, my last day at Big Soul Sucking Corp. is next week, and then I'm jumping into my own business full time :))<p>I still don't have a hot billion dollar idea, but I've decided to open a software development company (don't want to self-promote, if you're interested, there's a link in my profile). I've got some clients already, been working on it 4-5 hours every day for the last 4 months, and now actually making enough money to survive without a day job (ramen-survive, but still).<p>I also started another business, it has nothing to do with computers/technology, but it is  bringing in an income stream too, and has potential to grow (international wholesale trading, if you're interested).<p>So, just wanted to say a big THANK YOU to everyone on this board, who provided an inspiration for me over the years to finally ""make a leap"". Thank you!",1258174014

Period.<p>Frankly, I think he's being a bit of a whiner about the whole thing. There are what, 100k apps in the store? If they weren't QCing it would be 1,000,000 and the percentage of shit apps would be MUCH higher than it is now (and it is through the roof right now).",1258173986

There's so much money to be made that if half the small developers quit, the rest will simply fill the void. It's the same game theory concept that ensures the tuna will be fished into extinction.

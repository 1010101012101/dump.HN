My cat could be 100 lbs and she&#x27;d still be more interested in kibble and pillows than mauling me.  So, no not all animals are sociapathic (I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s the right word in any case).  Wild animals are wild and do wild animal things, they absolutely live and die by a different code.<p>But this whole argument, I think is spurious.  Simply because they follow a different set of rules doesn&#x27;t mean that they don&#x27;t deserve our caring and protection.<p>Your argument sounds a lot like the one people make about other groups of people who find themselves morally superior versus another group.  Replace &quot;animals&quot; with &quot;muslims&quot; or &quot;jews&quot; or &quot;communists&quot; or whatever and it may sound familiar.<p>That we recognize and respect that animals have needs and feelings even if they are not beneficial to us is exactly the point of this.",1429153102

9385634,comment,9360553,9372018,0,0,csandreasen,,,"> The vulnerability is not in how many keys you need to open a lock, the vulnerability is in requiring the same keys to open all locks.<p>And why would you use the same keys to open all locks?  Here&#x27;s a quick off-the-top of my head solution:<p>The device manufacturer creates a public/private key pair - maybe they make a new one for each device, or maybe for efficiency they make a new pair for each batch or once a month or whatever they deem acceptable.  The point is to change it regularly.  The court system creates its own public/private keys, changed every two months or so.  The FBI creates their own as well, let&#x27;s say changed every three months.<p>When the device is manufactured, the current public keys for the manufacturer, court and FBI all go on the device.  When the disk is first encrypted by the user, a key is generated, encrypted by the FBI, manufacturer and court in that order, then stored in a separate location on the disk.  Later on when the FBI gets its hands on the phone and wants to decrypt it, they send the encrypted key to the court along with the warrant application; if the court approves, they decrypt it and it gets sent on to the device manufacturer.  They look up the serial number of the device and decrypt with the appropriate key, then send it on to the FBI.  The FBI finally decrypts using their private key and can subsequently get the initial key used to encrypt the hard drive.<p>In order to decrypt a device without going through this process, you would have to get physical access to phone and also compromise all three private keys.  If you did somehow manage to get all three of the keys, you&#x27;d only be able to decrypt devices manufactured within at most a two-month time frame.  If that&#x27;s still not an acceptable level of risk, it can be further limited by increasing the frequency at which keys are replaced, creating multiple keys for each window, adding additional agencies with their own keys into the process, etc.<p>> An attacker who can copy the encrypted contents of your disk and later compromises your key then won&#x27;t be able to decrypt the copied data with it<p>I&#x27;m trying to imagine a situation where this is actually an issue... the closest I can come up with is: a cop arrests me, fails to get a warrant, illegally copies the encrypted data off my cell phone and retains the encrypted data anyways.  I&#x27;m let go and my phone is returned, and I subsequently delete all of the incriminating evidence from my phone (overlooking the fact that destroying evidence is a crime).  The police later arrest me for something else, confiscate my phone and this time they <i>do</i> get a warrant to search it.  Now they decrypt their old data and discover the files I deleted, none of which is admissible in court because it was illegally acquired.<p>I personally think it&#x27;s a little far fetched for your average criminal suspect, but I&#x27;ll play along and say that it&#x27;s maybe within the realm of possibility for someone high-value enough.  I suppose the simple solution would be to do something like use a file system that keeps some sort of hash of the file structure and last modification time, so that you could prove that the file in question didn&#x27;t come from the data they were authorized to collect.  I think that&#x27;s probably going too deep into performance trade-offs for something that&#x27;s unlikely to occur.<p>If you&#x27;re that worried about incriminating evidence that was left undiscovered on your phone, the simpler solution is to just get a new phone.  I wouldn&#x27;t trust any device that an adversary had physical control over then handed back to me.  In this case, why would someone risk eventual conviction to save $400 for a new phone?",1429152448

This does not mean be rude to them or try to be difficult. It just means that you have to assert your rights. Any cop who does not respect a person&#x27;s rights does not, in my eyes, deserve cooperation.<p>Of course, almost everyone would love to help the police with their investigation as much as they can but in a litigious climate with plea bargaining (and not to even talk about the illegal quotas that officers need to meet), I am simply not convinced that there is enough incentive for law enforcement to get the right person.<p>Life is not CSI. Cops are people too. They want to go home at the end of the day. I am not saying all police officers are corrupt all the time. I am simply saying most of them are overworked (and perhaps underpaid) a lot. If you think about it from this perspective, I hope you&#x27;ll agree that not asserting your rights and helping law enforcement is a terrible idea. There is a video on YouTube that talks about the same thing. If they tell you the investigation is not directed towards you, have them give you something in writing (make sure your lawyer reads it) that grants you a full and unconditional pardon. Of course, they will not grant it.<p>In case of jaywalking, I&#x27;d say the law is flawed. If the people who allocate resources for law enforcement think that it is enough of a problem, they should allocate enough resources to cover for people&#x27;s right to refuse to identify themselves unless presented with a warrant.<p>In the same vein, I really wish that the monies from fines and tickets not go to the police or to the general treasury at all. I wish we treated such money as bad money. I don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;d do with it but doing any good with bad money taints the good efforts and will eventually rot the effort.

The optimist in me thinks we should be focusing less on predicting recidivism and more time trying to prevent it.

The framers put several checks in place to prevent the federal government from becoming too powerful:<p>1) Enumerating the powers of the executive. There will be no King George in America!<p>2) Designing the checks & balances system such that (in theory) no one of legislative, executive, judicial could become too powerful to override the other two.<p>3) As you mentioned, the inclusion of the second amendment (and third, fourth, eighth) were all designed to prevent repeating problems the colonists faced before the war.<p>4) Tenth amendment was added to further strip the federal government of its non-enumerated powers.<p>The framers wanted something stronger than AoC, but they were very clear in their desire to limit the power of the federal government. They wanted a weak executive, and the legislative, particularly the Senate, was designed to be the main &quot;doer of things&quot;.<p>The executive was initially quite powerless on purpose. When Jefferson tried to do the Louisiana Purchase, people challenged whether the executive had this power. Andrew Jackson then came along and began the journey of expanding the powers of the executive, followed by Lincoln suspending habeus corpus, and more modern figures such as FDR with the internment camps and New Deal all continuing to expand these powers.

They do mention that they are no longer able to take advantage of sendfile() which was letting the bulk of the data transfer to happen completely in kernel space.<p>So, in their case, they had already optimized things to such a degree that they were having a lot of throughput and very little CPU usage per byte.  In fact, it&#x27;s possible that on their old system the data streams wouldn&#x27;t have to be touched a byte at a time, as they could be loaded into main memory via DMA from the disk and once that finished they could be transferred to the network card, again via DMA.  Once sendfile() is called, no further context switches are necessary for that request.<p>Testing with `openssl speed -evp AES128` on an i5-4670K I&#x27;m able to get 6.7 gigabits of encryption out of AES-NI.  I tried running two concurrent copies and they each got that speed, which tells me that it&#x27;s per-core.  That&#x27;s easily enough speed to saturate a 10G connection.<p>It&#x27;s quite possible that they have much older or slower hardware involved, since when you&#x27;re building a server like this normally the network or disks are the limiting factor.",1429150397

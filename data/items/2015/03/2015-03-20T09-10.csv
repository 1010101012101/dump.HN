So I could drop in Ruby where I previously might have used Python or Perl. This was much harder to do with Lisp or Smalltalk, for example.<p>But I didn&#x27;t have a good excuse to really use it at work until Rails came along and completely blew the existing Java frameworks out of the water for productivity.",1426845513

Or indeed care much about performance.<p>While there are lots of productive, opinionated Ruby developers, the vast majority of us don&#x27;t know much about the internals of the language.<p>Heck, for my part I&#x27;m working on a Ruby compiler (and have been writing about it for 7 years now... Unfortunately I have far too little time to devote to it), and part of the challenge is that there&#x27;s no proper language spec and even most people working on MRI does not know the full semantics of the language.<p>My favourite example of this, is that for a long time during the 1.8.x, the inheritance of one of the core classes was different than what was documented - I wrote an article about the Ruby object model and was &quot;corrected&quot;; except my diagram had been created based on instrumenting the interpreter to verify what <i>actually</i> happened. It was like that for years without anyone noticing (and to be fair, it was a dark corner of the language - very little code depends on the specifics of the inheritance of the eigenclasses of the core classes).<p>Of those of us who love Ruby <i>and</i> are interested in compiler technology <i>and</i> have the motivation to slog it out to try to get working compilers - whether JIT or AOT - there are extremely few.<p>And most of that effort is going into JRuby, which is definitively seeing some impressive improvements (e.g. with Truffle) but which a lot of us avoid because of the JVM.<p>Ruby <i>will</i> get faster.

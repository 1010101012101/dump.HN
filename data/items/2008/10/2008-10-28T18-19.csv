Stanford has been providing distance learning in engineering for 30+ years, primarily to local high-tech companies.  Delivery was done through dedicated TV circuits (most client companies are local), VCR tapes and started switching to Internet in 1999.  That means that the classes, the facilities, and all the associated processes are fully optimized for remote delivery.  Curious side benefit for full time students in CS is that you really don't need to go to class, and can just watch it on TV/Internet.<p>This used to be called SITN (Stanford Instructional Television Network), and is apparently called SCPD ( <a href=""http://scpd.stanford.edu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scpd.stanford.edu</a> ) now.

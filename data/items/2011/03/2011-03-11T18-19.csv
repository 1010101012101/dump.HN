There is a huge difference between an 8.9M 200km offshore and an 8.9M directly below a city. The ground motions recorded were relatively low in the cities and not very destructive. PGV (peak ground velocity) is a more accurate way to estimate the strain put on infrastructure. This shakemap shows that the intensity was relatively low: <a href=""http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/shakemap/global/shake/c0001xgp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/shakemap/global/shake...</a><p>Many people said the same thing about building codes after the 7.1 in Christchurch last September.

That attitude just means that people go around squatting for names.<p>Seriously: you should have to earn the usage of your name. Before this stupid world where poorly thought-through websites allow people to, for the remainder of all time (or until the company dies), reserve a name, multiple people could use the same name as long as they didn't cause confusion to the populace (at which point it should be expected that the courts become involved, as that is a matter of fraud).<p>Regardless, if you want to take the definition of ""first == fair"", GIRLGEEKS had that name in 1999. Everyone is making it sound like ""if you don't get a trademark on your name someone else can take it from you"", but that totally ignores the fact that they'd have to get a reasonable trademark /before/ you established your name (and conflicts with your use class, which I believe this situation did, and causes confusion, which I can see this situation also doing).<p>In this case, the thing people should be bothered about is that GIRLGEEKS has a ""DEAD"" trademark that was cancelled for its use class: they don't have a trademark, and Twitter made a mistake in honoring it.",1299869258

Yet given that human are complex and varied creatures, it's a onerous task for someone to continuous exemplify any quality, even ""excellence"".

Encryption without authentication is, at best, a trivial form of obfuscation (it's trivial because everybody knows how to reverse it).</i><p>In the context of my comment I was referring to the top-down cert authority structure (sorry if that wasn't clear), I didn't mean to imply that a webserver shouldn't have any certificate at all. I guess it comes down to disagreeing with you about self-signed certificates.

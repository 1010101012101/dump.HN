As someone working on developing data-driven machine learning systems for marketing purposes, it made me think twice about some of the conclusions I am able to jump to based only on correlation.  Certainly, these methods are quite useful in my field and the other less precise social sciences.

I should have added the caveat that ""if an investor or if a customer knew how you were handling this aspect of your business"".<p>Fact of the matter is that customers and investors only see these kinds of expenses in very summary form if at all. So it's generally impossible for them to make a decision based on this kind of information.<p>On the other hand the total expense picture is always a factor in pricing and investment decisions and this one would play a small part in that.<p>However, a manager that was spending $1,000 for a launch page he/she could have deployed for free or maybe even $5 a month that manager is probably having problems with other aspects of expense management and this would show up in the final pricing and investment picture.",1214938493

233309,comment,233172,233293,0,0,gravity,,,"I'm in the process of switching from vim to emacs right now. It's frustrating, although viper-mode takes a lot of the pain away, and to be honest I find it a really nice combination to have the vi editing modality readily available within the powerful framework of emacs. Remapping caps lock to Control has helped enormously.<p>The most notable thing is that emacs encourages you to live in it much more than vim. With vim, I would navigate around in the shell, open up a file in vim, edit, close, repeat. With emacs I'm finding that I spend more time just switching buffers instead of running back to the shell because emacs doesn't simply quit when I kill all my open files. There's always more buffers, so the app stays open and I tend to remain there.<p>I'm still in the process of getting up to speed with basic editing things, although I've found that the way it manages buffers and what it calls windows (what the rest of the world calls frames these days) is quite easy and quick to use, and I found myself able to navigate around in emacs fairly quickly. All in all, I'm not 100% sure I'll stick with it, but I'm happy so far and I know that I'm still getting over the hump to where I'll be truly productive with it.",1214938212

The tutorial linked is indeed pretty solid and it was trivial to get Scalr up, but the product itself seems half finished (which to be fair makes sense since its very early at v.5). I also took a gander at the code, and I was equally not impressed.<p>I am excited at the potential of Scalr, and maybe in another few months to a year I'll take another look, but for now I would still rather just manage EC2 by hand than become dependent on Scalr.",1214936146

99893,comment,99831,99831,0,0,DocSavage,,,"Short stories are a tough market.  Few people can make a living writing fiction, and almost nobody can make a living selling short stories.  (I've been told this was not the case 50 years ago.)  There's a good percentage of professional fiction writers who stay away from short stories, not because it isn't a nice form, but because it won't pay the bills.<p>If for some reason you <i>must</i> write sci-fi/fantasy short stories, you should submit to the Writers of the Future contest.  Great prizes, no entry fee, and you won't be competing against anyone who has already sold 2 or more stories.  Write 4 stories per year and submit them to each quarter's contest.  And stomp on a few cans while you write.",1200596046

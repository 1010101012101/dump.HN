One thing I'm wondering  is: where exactly does the money VC's provide go? The reason I ask is I'm planning on developing in my off time (usually only sleep 4-5 hours a night anyway so even with a dayjob I'll have a decent amount of time at least to start out.) so I won't need to support myself with investment money or anything. So what DO I need money for? Where do all those millions actually go? I'm having a hard time conceiving a situation where I would need to spend anything of that order. Advertising? Hiring additional coders? Hosting? If I'm just a 3-person outfit working in our free time where am I going to start incurring these huge hard costs?",1207071717

Android is completely open and lets you do everything you need, so the first version is based on that. However, there can't be an iPhone  app because Jobs is a control freak, he has decreed that I should not have the ability to write what I want to write.<p>So no, I just don't understand why people that supposedly value openness have such adulation for one of the most restrictive platforms out there.

Some won't like you. Others will notice their reaction and compensate for it. They will think you didn't do anything wrong, and they shouldn't react badly, and make sure to treat you normally.<p>If you don't wear clothes to fit in and be pretty, you only come off (a bit) worse with the people who aren't self-aware enough. In business, it's important to be able to get along with flawed people; they can still be valuable business partners.

DH1 Ad Hominem almost defines our political system.  From the book: ""The motive fallacy is so common in politics that serious policy debate is almost nonexistent.  The announcement of a new policy is greeted, not with a discussion of its alleged merits, but with a flurry of speculation from journalists and political opponents regarding the politician's motives for announcing it.  He wants to appease the right wing of his party, or is trying to win favor in marginal rural states, or is bowing to the racist clamoring of the gutter press, or what-have-you.""",1207070530

Many specification flaws only come to light when developing the back end -- which may, in turn, require changes to the already-complete front end, wasting time.<p>In general, the article makes fun of methodologies by picking a handful of software design approaches and pushing them to absurd extremes, hoping that the rest just falls into place.

But none of them are starting a company. The idea doesn't seem to intrigue them either.<p>If you have the entrepreneurial spirit in you, constantly remind yourself that you have it, regardless of where you are and what people tell you. If you have it as a highschooler, great. The eye for opportunity is a great gift, and colleges do not know how to measure this, nor can they teach you how to acquire it.<p>I don't think you should worry if a school will turn you into a successful entrepreneur. The greater concern should be people to bounce ideas off of, and potentially work with. Talent is everywhere; train yourself to spot it. That is an asset second to none.<p>I must agree with pg though. Vibe is very important. It's a lot more enjoyable to build stuff when everybody around you is talking about building stuff too. Where I went to school, people spend more time talking about philosophy :)",1175361591

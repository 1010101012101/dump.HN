1. You can pinch to zoom while during turn-by-turn navigation
2. You can select a point anywhere in the map and it instantaneously gives you the time to drive there from your current location (which is also a link to the navigation details/options.
3. Feels like a real map compared to the barren-ass land that Apple's Map shows.
4. Streetview (that is even smoother than the browser version)<p>Cons:
1. No integration with the address book.<p>Pros >>>> Cons.",1355417995

The point is that when velocity is constant, there's no indicator that your pedal manipulation is <i>good</i> as opposed to <i>bad</i>. For that to happen, you would need a period of time where you <i>messed up</i> with the pedal, and <i>saw</i> that you messed up. Then you could make an argument like: Hey, when we let hillAngle-pedalAngle [or whatever] drift away from zero, things go bad [velocity will fall].<p>Now it <i>is</i> true that you can measure collinearity between the hillAngle and the pedalAngle and show that they are correlated... but we sorta knew this already, didn't we? After all, we're <i>setting</i> the pedalAngle <i>based on</i> the hillAngle. We created that functional relationship. There's no need to empirically discover it.<p>Put it another way. Suppose v = w1 * hillAngle + w2 * pedalAngle + v0, and you want to find w1 and w2.<p>If your dataset shows pedalAngle = -hillAngle, then you have<p>v = w1 * (-pedalAngle) + w2 * pedalAngle + v0 = (w2 - w1) * 0 + v0<p>So you're dataset tells you nothing about w1 and w2.",1355417820

The typical curriculum if you want a correct career in CS outside of research is to go through an engineering school and the amount of maths (and physics) you need to enter and then to graduate is mostly equivalent to a BSc.

Globally, a French student leaving high school has done slightly more maths than a UK/US first year university maths major (calculus and basic linear algebra are taught in high school). A typical CS major in France, independently of the cursus, will most likely have done the same amount of maths than someone with a maths MSc in the UK (I am talking of a 5 years curriculum which is standard for a CS degree in France).

4916397,comment,4915328,4915773,19,0,sirclueless,,,"To add to your claim that math is fundamental to computer science, I think there's a big factor that isn't being mentioned: knowing math future-proofs your career better than knowledge of any technology or language.<p>Mathematical depth is the irreducible core of a computer scientist's value. Fundamentally, what computers provide is the mechanization of knowledge. In the same way that robotics came along and mechanized all of the entry-level manufacturing jobs (the root of the current ""skills gap"" in manufacturing, more so than outsourcing in my opinion), over the coming few decades I expect that computers will mechanize most entry-level knowledge workers' jobs, if they haven't already.<p>And the wacky thing about comp. sci. is that our entry level positions <i>are</i> in fact basic knowledge-work. As the field matures, the fields that are the bread-and-butter of basic vocational computer science are increasingly swallowed by more sophisticated technical solutions that are more mechanized and productized. Comp. Sci. is an ouroboros, eating its own tail of unskilled positions.<p>The most obvious example currently is sysadmins: computing infrastructure is being productized and sold under the umbrella of ""cloud computing,"" and its main value proposition is that you can cut your sysadmin budget by a huge margin. Similarly, QA and software testing departments are having their lunch eaten by better testing practices and automated solutions such as CI: the jobs aren't disappearing entirely, they are just being consolidated into a tiny department (maybe even one dev, part time) that can maintain an automated infrastructure. At a more basic level, data entry positions started drying up years ago with the advent of OCR, and now most of the big easy targets are entirely mechanical (ex. the post office/shipping).<p>In short, the best way to provide enduring value is to provide mathematical insight that can't be mechanized. If you can recognize optimizations and opportunities that take advantage of the unique structure of your domain, you are unlikely to be swallowed by someone with a productized version of your livelihood. If all you can manage is CRUD apps for enterprise, then when someone comes along with a general product that reduces your department from many guys writing software to one guy managing the product, you aren't gonna convince anyone of your value. At that point your only defense is the behemoth of bureaucracy, but the competitive nature of business suggests that it won't be a great defense for long.",1355416135

They have $120B in the bank, more cash than any other company has ever had.

In theory, this sounds like it would be correct, however the middle class is born out of a balance between supply and demand. When Supply is too high or demand is too high, the middle class states to disappear, whether from lack of funds to buy things or from lack of a job. However, in a healthy service based economy, where people are needed to create more supply, then businesses are more likely to hire and train someone with less experience and take the risk because the risk may pay off. When there is a demand problem, companies will not take the risk (thus what we have now, people need experience to start working). Lowering the wage will cause a demand problem, and will simply put us in the same position we are in now because people will not be able to afford goods. It sounds good, businesses creating things cheaper, but that really only helps people who have money already, and they aren't the ones that need the help.",1355415485

4916268,comment,4902802,4907959,1,0,ahoge,,,"Unlike JavaScript, Dart was created with performance (and tooling) in mind. There are a few people involved who worked on several VMs such as HotSpot or V8. JavaScript didn't have that kind of guidance. There are some features in JavaScript which make optimizations very difficult or even next to impossible.<p>The most obvious ones are probably `eval`, `with` (each property can mean something different with every iteration), and messing around with `arguments` (changing values of that pseudo array also changes the values of the actual named parameters).<p>You can also change, overwrite, and delete everything. `this` can also refer to something different each time.<p>Those quirks make JavaScript VMs very complicated and they also result in many surprises. For example, using `delete` can degrade performance quite a bit and adding properties to built-in objects can break some optimization-related heuristics.<p>Dart just skipped all of that really nasty stuff.<p>Well, to be fair, they also skipped one of the very useful nasty parts: on-stack replacement (OSR). If there is just one long-running function it won't get optimized (it won't get replaced - right there on the stack - with an optimized version).<p>Generally, this doesn't matter much, but there are some cases where it's really inconvenient.<p>It's safe to assume that they will address this once they are done with all optimizations they deem more important. I'd guess it will happen before they hit the big 1.0 (M1 = 0.1-ish).",1355414834

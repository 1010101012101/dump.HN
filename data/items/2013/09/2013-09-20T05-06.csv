6416151,comment,6415698,6415698,12,0,beloch,,,"Self-plagarism is a tricky thing. Some redundancy in publications is virtually unavoidable.  If you are reporting new results from an experiment that has been previously published, you still need to provide a brief summary of how things work but, of course, you reference your previous work.  This is as transparent and innocent as things get, and isn&#x27;t self-plagiarism. However, what if you reproduce a figure published in another journal exactly?  Then things can get ugly (Depending on a lot of legalese no researcher should have to worry about.)!<p>To make matters worse, the same experimental setup is frequently used to run experiments that result in several publications.  When you have several papers authored by different overlapping groups of researchers in various stages of review simultaneously things can get very confusing.  The first paper you submit is frequently the last one published. The last paper you submit will then wind up referencing arxiv pre-prints instead of published articles, and if you did plagiarize yourself by mistake, the publisher of the paper submitted last might have absolutely no chance of detecting it.  On top of it all, there is frequently interference from editors and reviewers. A well-written and coherent paper on a theory an experiment testing that theory might be considered &quot;too long&quot; or &quot;too confusing&quot; by a referee, and the editor will jump on that comment and demand the paper be split into two, sometimes only one of which they feel like publishing in their journal.  If the researcher had done this of his/her own initiative many would consider it CV-padding!<p>Yes, self-plagiarism can be a means to pump up your publication list, but it also happens innocently because publishing is such a confusing counter-intuitive mess!  It&#x27;s probably an idiotic idea, but some kind of pan-journal version control system, even just for figures, would be a tremendous headache reducer if done right!",1379656255

It, to me, is a critical look at what ways these amazing tools created by the tech community are used for.<p>For example, reading the comments about him before his reply show a case of the fundamental attribution error on most of the commentators parts, ie assuming he is a &#x27;hipster&#x27; and &#x27;stand out for standing-out&#x27;s sake&#x27;. As soon as he revealed the financial reasons for his dress and actions a lot of the stereotyping/prejudicial comments were stopped as well. That to me is interesting and worthy of studying.

If users love your app after release, focus on fixing the littler things like battery usage. If users hate it, try to fix the things that make them hate it, and then focus on the battery life.<p>Caveat: As in all optimization discussions, there are reasonable minimum thresholds for acceptability even in the &quot;unoptimized&quot; state.

On a bike, the choices are being one with a car, breaking a collar bone on a redwood or plummeting hundreds of feet.  Wiping out or considering leaping over might be options.<p>For anyone not familiar with Skyline, it&#x27;s a ridge country road that hugs the mountain range btw the pacific and the valley.  It also gets hairier towards Los Gatos IIRC.  Random fog and clouds can turn visibility to near zero in an instant.  For most of it south of San Mateo county is gentle road with more/less some visibility apart from over-the-horizon hills.  In San Mateo, it starts to become twistier and more/less switchbacks up to 92 (crosses skyline).

Is it expected that most people will just host their own version?

Whether your report leads to any results is probably negatively correlated with how long you wait to file it, but you can&#x27;t be sure it won&#x27;t until you actually report it.<p>However, many crimes (especially more minor ones) have a <i>statute of limitations</i>, where the crime can&#x27;t be prosecuted after a certain amount of time.<p>And older investigations are harder -- a witness in a house adjacent to the crime scene may have remembered hearing a crunch followed by a car speeding away at the time of the accident if interviewed the following day or week, but may have utterly forgotten, or moved away and be impossible to locate, or have become unable to testify due to developing mental incapacity or becoming deceased, if the day in question was months, years, or decades ago.  Likewise, the next day there might be tire marks, bike parts, or other physical evidence at the crime scene, but after months or years it will have deteriorated or totally disappeared.<p>Also police surely know that older investigations are harder, so in addition to the problems with the evidence itself, having an older case you might not be assigned as many police resources because they know there&#x27;s a lower probability of success, and it&#x27;s their duty to taxpayers to use their limited number of detectives, etc. on the cases they have the best likelihood of solving, so those taxpayer dollars are used most efficiently.<p>But this doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t report it.  You don&#x27;t know exactly how your crime will be classified (assault?  traffic offense?  attempted homicide?), so you don&#x27;t know what the statute of limitations actually is.<p>It might be that your report provides the missing piece of a puzzle -- there might be a cold case file in the police station saying, &quot;A local mechanic noticed a car brought in for repairs had bike parts embedded in the grille and blood on the tires, the license and owner information was entered in the case file, and we&#x27;re pretty sure we know who was driving.

I was placed in a room, given a computer with no internet access and given a bunch of CSS and Javascript to do, and then answer some Javascript theory questions.<p>Before the interview started, the head of technology mentioned to me that he didn&#x27;t expect me to know ALL the css off the top of my head, that we all sometimes need a quick peak at some of the less frequently used or newer attributes.<p>He also mentioned that a previous applicant had taken a whole two hours to complete the assignment, and that he felt that was too long.<p>After looking over the questions, I thought to myself, two hours, that&#x27;s a ridiculously large amount of time, to do what was asked. I figured I&#x27;d be out of there in 40 minutes.<p>Then I started. I forgot how to do a background-gradient in CSS, toyed with that for probably 15 minutes before moving onto the next thing. Couldn&#x27;t get my nth-child working (was using square brackets instead of regular - doh!), didn&#x27;t remember how to implement a word-wrap, didn&#x27;t know how to write media queries off the top of my head. As a result, just the CSS portion took an hour as I kept banging my head against the wall trying to remember these things. So 90% of the css was a no brainer, but these tiny little things, where I knew the how of the answer and a two second search would have the result, meant the task was a total failure.<p>Then the Javascript, all went good, but I blanked on setInterval. The setTimeout was happy to fill my conciousness but would not let it&#x27;s sibling setInterval have any peak of the spotlight I so desperately needed it to have. Thankfully at 1.5 hours in the Head of Technology peaked in to ask me how it was going, and I said I couldn&#x27;t remember the name of setTimeout&#x27;s sibling, he told me setInterval, and I was back to the races.<p>I think I got about 90% of the theory questions right.<p>Before I left, the Head of Technology mentioned that he had hoped and thought I&#x27;d do better on the test. I&#x27;m assuming this is based on the amount of time it took me to do it, though it could also have been based on my exact memory of the less-often used CSS classes, and my mind failing me with setTimeout.<p>At the same time, I have to think that, as a developer, day to day, minute to minute, I probably spend about 10% of my time having to look-up the odd javascript method, or css attribute. Does that make me a bad programmer? What value is the test if it isn&#x27;t done with the tools you&#x27;ll use when actually working.<p>I think the most important thing for all of these tests wasn&#x27;t if I could remember the name of the attributes and methods, but rather if the structure was right, code was readable and worked.<p>Had I been allowed internet access, even if I was just limited to just w3.org, I would have had the whole thing completed in no time.<p>I suspect I won&#x27;t get the position as a result of my lack of performance (though the Head of Technology also said that nobody else had measured up), which I&#x27;m quite disappoined about, because I feel it isn&#x27;t a good reflection of my capabilities.<p>At the same time, I am disappointed in myself because I do &#x27;know&#x27; the answers to everything I was trying to do, but just wasn&#x27;t able to put it together on the day.<p>Anybody else have similar stories, or advice for these situations?",1379653314

They just check for integrity in the physical license itself hologram in the right place, etc -- something you can&#x27;t do with a scanned copy of a license.  They don&#x27;t have a master database that they phone home and check in with to see if the data on the card is forged.<p>Actually, they do have a database - of the info they read off the cards.   The bars use that info for two things: (1) if you are enough of a troublemaker, they put you on the list to reject next time.  (2) they also sell all of their card scan info to the data brokers.  That&#x27;s right, places like Equifax, TRW, etc know the time and date of every time you went to a bar that scanned your ID.",1379653282

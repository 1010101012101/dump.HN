This toolbar too bluntly tries to mimic hardware video players, and takes worst from them.<p>Play, which is about the only useful control the toolbar except for the slider, is located in the lower left corner between two Move buttons.

If you want to stop the video, just close the window. If you want to pause, just pause. You don't need a stop.<p>Then there are these play order buttons. Come on, do you really watch 20 videos in row? There's a YouTube for that. Useless.<p>Equalizer?<p>It's painful to see so little space left for the slider. <i>People use toolbar to scroll through the movie!</i> Finding the exact scene will be extraordinary difficult because unneeded buttons take most of the space.<p>Do an experiment. Release a beta version that tracks each click. Generate usage heat map for all controls on the toolbar. Make most used items large and simple to hit (place them in the center). Get rid of the rest.<p>I'm also staying with MPlayerX because of its preferences window.

We need a more positive term for the kinds of businesses that 37Signals, Kalzumeus, and UnicornFree are doing.<p>Startups depend on huge cash infusions for many years before achieving profitability, if ever.
Smartups fund themselves almost from day one.<p>Startups do anything and everything to achieve hypergrowth, which paradoxically leads to tolerating sloppy code that doesn't scale. Smartups plan for steady growth. They get it as right as possible the first time, without getting bogged down with analysis.<p>Startups often end in face-saving ""talent acquisitions"".
Smartups are closed down when they stop being profitable, but it's okay because nobody lost all that much money.<p>Startups have a broad variance of outcomes. You could exit with millions or be badly in debt. Smartups look for opportunities where the expected revenue per hour worked is very high.<p>Startups offer free services and hope to make it back with targeted advertising or premium features. Smartups charge for the service they provide.<p>Hence, startups need millions of users, elite operations talent, and so on. Smartups are happy to focus on a few thousand people from a bargain ISP.<p>The main goal of a startup is to generate a perception of momentum among investors or acquirers. The main goal of a smartup is user satisfaction.<p>Startups are injurious to the founders' personal relationships and health.
Smartups require sacrifices like anything else in life, but leave you with greater autonomy than before.<p>P.S. Michael K. Smith, an early tester at Apple, coined the term ""smartup"" but he probably didn't mean it the way I want to use it. Danese Cooper mentioned it to me and I just liked the way it sounded.",1329126925

In terms of <i>cognitive</i> minimalism 'semis-everywhere' wins. @izs even acknowledges that part of the advantage is forcing the developer to learn:<p><i>To the extent that there is an objectively better choice, it appears to me that the minimal-semicolon/comma-first style is slightly superior, both because it is fundamentally more scannable and because it encourages programmers to better understand the language they use.</i><p>and later:<p><i>If you dont understand how statements in JavaScript are terminated, then you just dont know JavaScript very well, and shouldnt write JavaScript programs professionally without supervision, and you definitely should not tell anyone else how to write their JavaScript programs.</i><p>He excludes the possibility that you might understand the rules and still prefer to put them everywhere. So all people who disagree with his choice (which he admitted was only <i>slightly</i> better) tend to get categorized as people who don't understand JavaScript very well and we get a new holy war.

I have nothing now other than a cheap second hand desktop PC (and some cash in pocket!):<p>I agree with the build quality - they are good quality as in good materials and good fit. However, with my EE cap on, the designs themselves are bad and are quite dangerous. When there is literally that amount of LiPoly cells sitting inside a chassis, you want to be able to isolate the power. One bit of water in it and it's effectively an incendiary device. I've seen one recent MacBook Pro (pre-thunderbolt) go up with my own eyes quite spectacularly and wouldn't want something you can't drop the cells out of rapidly if you inevitably pour your coffee in it.<p>With regards to the software, I found the OSX environment inconsistent and XCode absolutely terrible. The OSX environment is inconsistent from the ""task focused"" application designs that you see. Every shipped application has its own set of behaviours and pretty much ignores a common standard resulting in head scratching. The keyboard shortcuts system is horrid and doing anything without the trackpad is hard work. XCode was just a mismash of concepts thrown together badly. As a comparison point, Visual Studio is a lot more mature and consistent and that is saying something.<p>The whole Apple/OSX ecosystem is a good attempt but it's not good enough for the money on the basis that some of the fundamentals are flawed. I'd actually throw more money behind Microsoft at the moment as they are heading in what I percieve to be the right direction. Apple started at a good point and have got worse.

I spend a significant amount of time waddling through it. Most of time I do batch processing, sorting mail to folders, reading select batches and only then responding.  Much of the sorting to folders could be automated by an intelligent set of filters, except that creating filters in outlook is tedious and my needs change over time. I wish someone would solve this - use AI; use bayesian filtering, whatever, just take away the manual labour. Don't make me think; help me.  Thanks.",1329123815

After looking into it, the $50 charge was under a mysterious ""professional fees"" which PayPal refused to explain. I did get my money back after repeated enquiries though.<p>On the other hand, there have been several disputes though where I didnt get a fair shake and was essentially ripped off.<p>Let's face it, for those outside of the US, PayPal is a necessary evil. I loathe having to use them. They seem grossly incompetent in terms of customer support.<p>Continue to try every PayPal connection you have. Go to the Consumerist, media outlets etc about this. Make some noise.<p>If you make a big enough stink about it, maybe the money will show up.",1329123800

3584814,comment,3584609,3584609,35,0,beloch,,,"Last July I bought one of the new Macbook Air's.  The price for the hardware you got was unbeatable, and that was ignoring build quality!  While previous Air's were anemic tarted up netbooks, the 2011 Air's were (and are) powerful enough for everyday use.<p>There was just one problem with the Air however.  Horrible Linux support.  I'd been using Kubuntu happily for years.  After looking at all the ugly dirty hacks people were using to get their Air's running, I decided to give OSX a trial for 6 months or so.  Long enough for Linux support to mature.  I hadn't used OSX since the early 2000's and it looked like the OS had come a long way.  To be precise, what really changed my mind was how far the OSX modding community had come.  Despite being hated and loathed by Apple, they had managed to fill in some of the gaping holes in core functionality that Apple philosophy forbade, such as a way to remap keys (in all applications, not just some).  I could finally remap the Apple key to something that didn't break my touch-typing habits on all the other OS's I use daily!<p>6 months later, I'm ready to jump ship.  I like OSX Lion's touchpad gestures, but beyond that, I'll miss little else about the OS.  OSX isn't bad mind you, but it's infuriatingly difficult to modify when it does something you don't like.  It's buggy.  It's actually pretty dated and ugly looking now too.  OSX's virtual desktop management has absolutely <i>nothing</i> on KDE's.<p>Unfortunately, just as the next version of Kubuntu was starting to look like a good one for the Air, Canonical announced that they are ceasing paid development of Kubuntu.  My favorite KDE distro is now officially on deathwatch.  Maybe it will live on with community support, like any other distro has to, or maybe it'll fall by the wayside.  I appreciate what Canonical is trying to do with Unity, but it's not for me.  I'd long felt like Kubuntu, despite it's many virtues, was being treated like a red-headed step-child.  This tears it.  I haven't decided what distro I'm going to yet, but it will be one that puts KDE first, and that rules out anything Ubuntu.",1329123708

Imagine your on the Starship Enterprise and you have to beam down to an unknown planet. Who do you want on your team? Well you want Kirk, probably a science officer (Spock) maybe the medical officer (Bones McCoy) , possibly the Coms officer (Uhura) and a maybe a RedShirt to get blasted away if you come across some real nasty situation.  [0]<p>So lets assume you are Kirk. The leader, human in touch with his emotions instincts and has the ability to  make decisions but passionate and aggressive.  Lets assume your other partner is Spock. Total nerd. At best unable to read human nuance, emotion at worst totally miss the poker move Kirk thinks up to save the day. At best he/she coolly out-logics the best Roumlan, Klingon or Borg enemies they face. Then there is Bones. Bones is also all empathy, human and the thinking conscience always trying to get out of sticky situations with the least harm. [1] <p>For each episode all three at some times came into conflict to resolve a difficult situation. Sometimes it was Spock and Bones butting heads over the most direct decision compared to the decision that caused least harm. Another time it's Spock advising Kirk not to take such rash action as trying to remove all the Tribbles as they do sooth the crew and saved the day as in  <i>""The Trouble with Tribbles""</i> [2]  <p>I guess what I'm trying to say is your wife may have the latent skills you need in your team that has to be identified. Identify her character skills. Is it all logical and calm like Spock? Passionate, rash and gambler and decision maker like Kirk? Or is she able to read into people and situations that baffle both Kirk and Spock as Bones can?<p>You need all three character types to succeed in any Starship (I mean startup) adventure, and YC interviews can also be included. Each personality contribute to produce a successful outcome. Choose the wrong combo and you'll be just another RedShirt in the application process.<p>PS My experience is that if you can determine this you can work to plug the gaps. Not all people are <i>creators</i> interested in building. But they may be logical analytical and empathetic at the same time.  <p>[0]  You can substitute these <i>""old-skool</i>"" trekky characters with NexGen Pikard for  Kirk, Warf/Data for Spock and maybe Troi for Bones ~ <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trouble_with_Tribbles"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trouble_with_Tribbles</a>",1190257115

57199,comment,57094,57094,0,0,bokonist,,,"Every point of friction the user encounters when trying to use a product is point where they will stop and do something else.  Desktop software is too difficult to try out.  People are scared of spyware.  Configuration and system compatibility can be a huge hassle.  Under Vista, there are a zillion security warnings to click through.  And in business environments, computers are often locked down.  Forcing users to go through that just to try your product will turn off the majority of your site visitors, resulting in much lower sales.<p>Another key factor is that with web based software you can do continuous releases, which is key in a competitive environment.<p>The only things that should be written as desktop software are applications that absolutely cannot be done in a desktop environment ( like games and P2P file sharing).  But even then, doing it in Flash is better than requiring an actual download.  <p>  ",1190256376

57196,comment,56626,56943,0,0,stuki,,,"	By encrypted mail, I meant end to end, pgp style encryption. For this to be of much use, Google (nor anybody else) would not have my private key, so all they see is a wall of random bytes.<p>	The very core of what makes Gmail so enjoyable is that their expertise in free form search allows me to pretty much stop caring about organizing my mail at all. I generally just hit archive, and rely on search to retrieve whatever I may need to later. No web mail client can provide such a service against encrypted mail.<p>	At the same time, it is Google's access to my mails' content that allows them to show me 'relevant' ads. Without this ability, providing Gmail for free will get a lot harder to justify.\n",1190255973

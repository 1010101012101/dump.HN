I&#x27;m not saying people are logical in this respect; I&#x27;m just saying that it happens, or at least that Keynes claimed that it happens. (I actually don&#x27;t really disagree with him in principle; I&#x27;m not sure the effect in practical terms is as significant as he appeared to think it was.)<p><i>> Money is a real thing, is a medium of exchange and there is a demand for it.</i><p>These are actually two different things, not one. The use of money as a medium of exchange is different from the use of money to store value over time.<p>Demand for money as a medium of exchange can become arbitrarily small by allowing prices to fall as economic efficiency improves. Keynes appeared to think this was a Bad Thing, but AFAIK he never actually demonstrated why, he just asserted it without proof and everyone believed him. Certainly there are examples where the price of a given quantity of some good (such as a given amount of computing power) has dropped by many, many orders of magnitude, without any discernible negative impact. So an obvious alternative to printing more money so there&#x27;s enough medium of exchange is to require less of the medium of exchange for each transaction.<p>The use of money to store value over time is what really creates significant demand for money. However, printing money in order to satisfy this demand defeats the purpose, because it reduces the value of money.<p><i>> the preferred Keynesian way of stimulating the economy is by fiscal policies (investing from the government), and not by “printing” money, but that is not possible in Europe or the States because politics</i><p>This is a good point, yes. However, I would add that the reason why the fiscal policy &quot;solution&quot; is not politically acceptable in Europe or the US is that was tried (in the 1930s during the Great Depression, and again to an extent after World War II) and didn&#x27;t work, because governments are atrociously bad at picking the right investments. So now governments prefer to print money and hand it to private investors, who, while they are still bad at picking good investments, are at least less bad at it than governments. (But there are still other bad side effects, such as an economic meltdown once in a while.)",1427855215

And not really in a good way.&quot;<p>From that you inferred I was a cultural chauvinist. Or was it the author? I can&#x27;t tell. But I generally agree with author&#x27;s negative views on those parts of the traditional Swedish upbringing, and prefer the modern ones more. In any case, given that Swedes actively worked to change their culture, they didn&#x27;t like it either.<p>You broadened the conversation to be &quot;other cultures&quot;. Yes, your shift from specific details about older Swedish culture to a generic &quot;some cultures&quot;  diminishes the importance of observations, and yes, sounds very much like relativism.<p>The comment about the corporal punishment was in the context of changes to Swedish child-raising practices in the mid-20th century. I meant it only as an example of how the examples I quoted fit into the internal debates in Swedish culture.<p>Yes, I think that beating one&#x27;s children is violence, and may lead to trauma. I&#x27;m much more sure of that than being able to make a full understanding of early 20th century Swedish culture to say the same about that situation. What I think is important is the evidence that small phrases, like &quot;you are nothing&quot; and &quot;dumb Swede&quot;, can cause unappreciated emotional turmoil. As these examples predate the concept of &quot;microagressions&quot;, there&#x27;s no chance that these were induced by the modern zeitgeist.",1427853929

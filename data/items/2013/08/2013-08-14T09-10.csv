6210629,comment,6209954,6209954,15,0,Osmium,,,"We are no where near the stage where we can judge if Hyperloop is a good or a bad idea yet. At the moment, it is just that: an idea. It needs to be refined, torn apart, put back together, and examined thoroughly and I look forward to that happening. I&#x27;m glad this article exists and is asking tough and valid questions, but I feel like the article is wrong in trying to persuade people that the Hyperloop is <i>intrinsically</i> a bad idea when a much better response (at this stage) is to try and improve the design.<p>In particular, some parts of this article are just way way off base, e.g.:<p>>  Teslas train energy consumption numbers do not pass a sanity check, which suggests either reckless disregard for the research or fraud. I wouldnt put either past Musk: the lack of references is consistent with the former, and the fact that Musks current primary endeavor is a car company is consistent with the latter<p>and<p>> I write this to point out that, in the US, people will treat any crank seriously if he has enough money or enough prowess in another field.<p>The article would have been much stronger if it&#x27;d left ego and silly ad hominem out of it and reported on facts alone.<p>I also have concerns about the costings: the Hyperloop report didn&#x27;t give sufficient justifications for any of them. Yet I assume they didn&#x27;t just pluck them out of thin air either. We really need to know how they were calculated before we can do a more critical analysis of them <i>or</i> someone should try and come up with their own rigorous cost projections. We can go back and forth all day saying it seems too low until someone actually definitely proves it.<p>In particular, comparing Musk&#x27;s projected costs for, e.g., viaducts to how much the government says they cost is almost definitely a poor metric since, after all, exactly the same could have been said for Musk&#x27;s cost projections for rocket-powered spaceflight.",1376473496

Those bugs are easy to translate into &quot;working code&quot;, because they carry through all the way from the top.<p>Then I much rather want a program that is easily malleable, than one where the flawed logic is encoded in the types.<p>If the problem space is known in detail upfront, then sure. But then writing test cases to cover them is just as simple.<p>Not least because if you really want to, writing test cases and type checks to enforce typing is trivial to do in dynamic languages too. In fact there are quite a few examples on how to do advanced type checks on Ruby code. With the level of introspection Ruby does, you can e.g. easily &quot;wrap&quot; every method with detailed enforcement of type invariants.<p>You need to run some functional tests to exercise the code paths to <i>trigger</i> said type checks, but you need functional tests anyway.<p>People don&#x27;t tend to use those methods because in practice they turn out to rarely capture many interesting errors once you write functional tests anyway.",1376473396

6210611,comment,6197823,6206097,1,0,vidarh,,,"No, it is substantially faster <i>with</i> the GIL too, for almost all &quot;real&quot; Ruby code. There are exceptions: code that spends most of their time in the interpreter. That&#x27;s pretty much no Ruby code. If you&#x27;re doing numeric computation etc. with present Ruby implementations, that <i>would</i> be impacted by it, you&#x27;re doing something wrong - the method call overhead in all current Ruby implementations is too high for that to be a good idea.<p>And as I pointed out, the GIL is an issue in only <i>one</i> of at least 4 available Ruby implementations as of last count. So you&#x27;re discounting the implementation based on the one Ruby implementation that is potentially scaling worse. Great. Let&#x27;s find an old slow Haskell implementation to compare to too.<p>> Without that, your speculative parallelism isn&#x27;t faster, it&#x27;s just as long unless it just happens to be threadsafe C extension IO<p>Performance wasn&#x27;t what was being discussed. The claim I responded to originally was that concurrency isn&#x27;t &quot;even something you can do with Ruby&quot;. I&#x27;ve demonstrated why that claim is flat out wrong, for <i>every</i> version of Ruby.<p>You  then claimed &quot;Generally parallelism is really much easier to express in a pure language and thus &quot;sparked&quot; parallelism is almost trivial to use in Haskell. I&#x27;m not sure that MRI even allows for parallel processes in its green threads due to GIL? Other Ruby implementations might have different restrictions there.&quot;<p>And I demonstrated how easy implementing speculative execution is in Ruby too, and pointed out that Ruby allows parallelism just fine even in old MRI version with green threads, new MRI versions with system threads, processes, or any of the number of non-MRI Ruby implementations that don&#x27;t use a GIL, but with different tradeoffs.<p>You can continue to shift the goalposts if you like, but I&#x27;ve addressed the original claims sufficiently.

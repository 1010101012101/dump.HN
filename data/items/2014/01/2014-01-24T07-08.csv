7113845,comment,7111049,7112762,3,0,lennel,,,"initial rendering should definitely be on the server, his premise to render content on the server side and then async load it in is flawed, he adds latency and the dom still has to parse a string at the end of the day and put them on the display tree, so the only bit he offloaded was a bunch of string concatenation (given he used a sane templating system) at the cost of latency. bad trade off IMO.<p>the downside to his reasoning is that he is tying himself to a single back end (node) if he used something like mustache he coulkd use any backend, but mustache implies parsing templates on the client. googles closure compiles to javascript functions and I am sure something like that exists for mustache and this would seem very sensical.<p>Converting a large string to a dom element is not expensive, it is when that dom element is added to the actual display tree when things go a bit awol, this is to be expected, redrawing any GUI costs a lot.<p>React is an excellent library and I am glad people use it, none of the ideas are radical however.",1390550378

But I find this to be a completely fascinating set of circumstances, and one which is leading to confusion and a lack of standardized rule of law.<p>You basically have federal US laws outlawing anything having to do with marijuana, and many people serving jail time for having possessed, grown, or distributed it.<p>You also have states that have said it is completely legal to possess, grow, and distribute it.  Right there, that strikes me as a weird combination: Don&#x27;t federal laws trump state ones?  (And wasn&#x27;t this sort of a central part of the Civil War, that states can&#x27;t just make up their own laws that contradict federal ones?)<p>The federal government is now saying, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry about those laws on our books.  We won&#x27;t prosecute you.&quot;  They&#x27;re even saying, in this article, that they won&#x27;t prosecute banks.  (Well, after the regulations are clarified.)<p>But that strikes me as an extremely inconsistent message, and one which can change at any point in time.  If everyone believes Holder, but then Holder changes his mind a year from now... well, then there&#x27;s nothing you can do, because he is doing nothing more than enforcing the laws -- laws that have been around for many years, and didn&#x27;t come as a surprise to anyone.<p>Moreover, what happens when another president or attorney general comes into office, and decides to enforce these laws to the max?  You&#x27;ll have banks, growers, and others suddenly prosecuted for federal crimes just because someone else came into office.<p>I think that these problems are likely to continue, until and unless marijuana use is decriminalized at the federal level.  Which, given the state of US politics right now, doesn&#x27;t strike me as very likely.",1390549873

So dismissing suggestion as a bad one you&#x27;d basically give a 1 star rating to an app. Or so the devs claim.<p>Coming from the iOS side, I just don&#x27;t get it. How can you rate an app that you haven&#x27;t downloaded? And then if you did download it, why is it being quick-suggested to you again?<p>Furthermore, if you did in fact download it, removed it and then reacted negatively to a suggestion to download it again - how&#x27;s your low-star reaction is NOT really a rating for an app itself?<p>Also, if you look closely at the graphs, the &quot;crashing&quot; involves rating slide from 4.67 to 4.38 and from 4.79 to 4.74. It&#x27;s still an unpleasant development for sure, but that&#x27;s not a &quot;crash&quot; or a &quot;drop&quot;, that&#x27;s a dip.

After these concerns resulted in an initial agreement so weak as to border on totally ineffective [1], their diplomats tried again [2] [3], and the states agreed but quickly demanded more limitations on federal power [4].<p>The ideological divide between states that allowed slavery and states that did not was a crisis on slow boil for the better part of the next century, resulting in various political compromises [5] [6] but eventually leading to a major civil war [7].<p>After the war was won by the side that favored a stronger national government, one of the side effects of the event was setting a precedent of the federal government imposing its policies on unwilling states at gunpoint [8].  (It&#x27;s not a typo in that reference when it notes the <i>Republicans</i> pushed for radical expansions of African-American rights; both parties basically completely switched sides with respect to racial issues after World War 2 [9]).<p>The sense of national unity was strengthened through the outcome of the war, increased interstate commerce due to the inventions of the Industrial Revolution, and the crises of the Great Depression and the world wars.  All of these events gave the federal government reasons to expand its powers [10] [11] [12], in ways which seemed like good ideas at the time but ended up resulting in a much more powerful federal government, and much weaker state governments, than anyone had envisioned.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_confederation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_confederation</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Convention"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Convention</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_fifths_compromise"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_fifths_compromise</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_compromise"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_compromise</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_civil_war"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_civil_war</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_civil_war#Reconstruction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_civil_war#Reconstructi...</a><p>[9] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy</a><p>[10] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_of_the_Bill_of_Rights"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_of_the_Bill_of_Ri...</a><p>[11] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixteenth_Amendment_to_the_Unit...</a><p>[12] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_deal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_deal</a>",1390549254

Marijuana legalization is opposed by many swing voters, and neither party can afford to lose those. Leaving matters up to states allows states where the majority favors continued criminal prosecution of marijuana offenses to do as they wish. This is actually the way it should be constitutionally.<p>I&#x27;m actually not sure how the federal government has the constitutional authority to enforce drug laws against the wishes of a state.

The federal government has no authority to enforce laws against most crimes that occur entirely within a state&#x27;s borders unless they violate international treaties.<p>EDIT: It appears the authority was challenged and affirmed in Gonzales v Raich case, though I think the opinion is in error as it grants the federal government complete authority to regulate local activity, an opinion which the Constitution was written to prevent.

Flooz&#x27; primary customer acquisition strategy was giving people free money.  That was pretty popular, but also costly, and -- unlike Paypal -- Flooz never successfully convinced meaningful numbers of customers to transition from &quot;spending free money&quot; to &quot;spending their own money.&quot;<p>2)  Flooz had far insufficient transaction volume to justify the ongoing engineering and operation costs of keeping it around.  At the peak, it was generating &quot;thousands&quot; of dollars of transactions a day.  You can do the math on that: $200k volume per month times the pick-your-teeth-with-them margins in payment processing means you can&#x27;t pay even a single engineer to keep the lights on.<p>3)  Flooz, like most early payment processors, got their pockets picked by fraud to the tune of millions of dollars.  Their merchant processor responded by requiring a $1 million rolling reserve.  This caused a cash-flow crunch which was the proximate cause of their bankruptcy.<p>4)  Flooz could have postponed death if they had access to the capital markets but the dot-com crash happened and, as a consequence, nobody wanted to throw more money at an e-commerce company whose core line of business was selling fake money for real money.<p>But bitcoin is, as you say, decentralized.<p>[Edit to add: I&#x27;m being a bit unfair there.  Bitcoin has several advantages over Flooz.  One is that Bitcoin, considered as an entity, awarded free money via seigniorage to early adopters and never had to back that free money with actual cash.  Another is that Bitcoin structurally encouraged the creation of a widely distributed self-coordinating Internet boiler room to act as Bitcoin spokesmen and salescritters, via the aforementioned seigniorage and tapping into pre-existing networks among people with complementary political opinions regarding e.g. banking, self-government, privacy, etc.  A third is that Bitcoin was, happily for Bitcoin advocates if not expressly hoped for, actually an improvement in the state of the art for small-scale drug smuggling, a business which turns out to be quite lucrative and underserved by other payment processors.  This lead to people who had acquired essentially free bitcoins getting paid actual money by folks who wanted to buy very-much-not-free contraband, which helped provide a bit of kindling for the speculative bonfire.]",1390547934

Good on you for this work to fill in something that&#x27;s missing from the whole Docker deployment process.   I love Show HN&#x27;s and there&#x27;s always something for everyone to learn here.<p>If I&#x27;m understanding your project correctly, what you&#x27;ve done is create a way to deploy some git-managed code into a Docker container.   It&#x27;s a good idea but I think you are attacking the problem from too high up the stack.  The real problem, as I see it, exists one level down: in the Dockerfile and the Docker image.  We need deeper control of the environment than a Dockerfile and your app deployer provides.  The popular approach is for developers to create their Dockerfile that builds their platform and instantiate a container from this.  The problem is that this works great for a small startup with a couple of devs but falls short for larger companies who want to layer configurations on top of one another, applying and enforcing rules across those configurations.   Let me explain:<p>Where I work, we have lots of servers running lots of apps.  The apps themselves are managed by various developers but we have standard things that we do across those servers, like install our monitoring agent, applying patches, configuring performance tweaks, etc.  The problem with running Docker in this environment is maintaining these things in a centralized manner.  Sure, we could create a bunch of Docker images that contain all of our organization standardizations but how do we maintain these?  Without Docker, we use Chef and Gangnam-style[1] cookbooks but Chef is not lightweight at all and it&#x27;s a total pain in the ass for junior guys to learn.<p>What I think we need is a system of building Docker images that allows dev & ops teams to collaborate and layer different configurations and applications on top of one another in a structured way.  It sounds like Chef, but this imaginary application evaluates the &quot;cookbooks&quot; and produces Docker images and Dockerfiles, not bootstrapped servers.<p>Perhaps Chef will evolve and people will adopt it for deploying Docker.   Perhaps someone will write the next-gen Dev/Ops configuration management tool and it will be built around Docker.  Perhaps this is already out there and I&#x27;m just not aware of it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://devopsanywhere.blogspot.com/2012/11/how-to-write-reusable-chef-cookbooks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://devopsanywhere.blogspot.com/2012/11/how-to-write-reus...</a>",1390547714

Taking Craigslist, for example I can get an RSS feed of any given category search:<p><a href=""http://www.craigslist.org/about/rss"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.craigslist.org/about/rss</a><p>Remember &quot;Web agents&quot;, you know &quot;a personal online assistant that would scour the Internet for you&quot;?  Well, this is it.<p>Combine that feed with rsstail and multitail, and you can track items of interest in a console window.  Find something particularly useful?  Fire off an email alert to yourself.<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/1udv6i/further_adventures_in_rss_chrome_reader_extension/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/1udv6i/further_...</a><p>I&#x27;ve got Chromium running on my Thinkpad T520i, sucking down about a gig and a half of RAM.  newsbeuter tailing 85 feeds is around 300 MB (a single Chromium browser tab), and rsstail weighs in at about 145 MB resident.  Since they&#x27;re only intermittently active, they swap out with very little performance overhead.<p>The existing Web design model is a fucking trainwreck waiting to happen.  The browser-as-app-platform metaphor has its advantages, mostly in rapid development, though that&#x27;s also a weakness (users <i>HATE</i> change), and it&#x27;s a bastardization of two competing uses (content vs. app).<p>Much of the design and feature set serves advertisers and NSA water-carriers far more effectively than it does users.  Sadly, that&#x27;s where the funding comes from, so it&#x27;s no real surprise.  Be careful what you incent for, you&#x27;ll get it.",1390547160

This is going to cost money like anything. A permanent PR company that at least gets the engineering profession a louder voice than Marissa Mayer would be a start. A permanent lobbying budget to slowly but continually chip away at domestic and international threats to the buying power of your talent with changes in law is the other half of how grown ups play &quot;war.&quot; No need to act like laborers and form a union or have strikes. Real change today happens via PR and lobbying. A well-funded and run professional organization formed with this as its sole agenda would do wonders for all of us.",1390546968

You can&#x27;t get the laptop to log in with no guest account and only the one user account. You can&#x27;t get it to boot to another device because of the bios lock. You can&#x27;t change the boot device with a bios password set. Finally you can&#x27;t reset the bios password because to do so you would need to remove the DRAM per the macbook bios reset instructions, and that&#x27;s not physically possible on an air since it&#x27;s soldered down.",1390546918

73652,comment,73609,73629,0,0,mxh,,,"Those numbers don't pass the smell test; Interest rates (e.g. mortgage rates) are nowhere near 12%, so if those figures are accurate, all sorts of lenders are paying you to take their money.  Additionally, and FWIW, I've been obsessively tracking my spending for the past 6 years, and have seen little if any signs of inflation.  My grocery bills from 2003 are indistinguishable from those from 2007.  (Yes, I'm a geek.)<p>I might be willing to buy a 12% number for inflation under some conditions, since there are lots of ways to calculate that number, and an emphasis on Gold/Oil prices and/or exchange rates might cough up a 12% figure.  I'd still consider it unrealistic unless you were heavily involved in such things.  However, the 40% for food seems fantastic, meaningless, or both.",1193635317

Go into a random trade hub and you get people shouting SEND ME E-MONEY AND I&#x27;LL DOUBLE IT!<p>They link to a &#x27;public&#x27; API showing that player&#x27;s financial transactions over time, giving &#x27;proof&#x27; that what he claims is legit. And for low quantities, it works too - to build trust, of course. But when the scammed sends over a large quantity of money, the scammer will add that to the &#x27;API page&#x27; and claim the user&#x27;s trying to scam him or there&#x27;s supposedly a technical problem, or something.<p>In this case, the scammer could improve by linking to a &#x27;transaction log&#x27; online, and by offering to double someone&#x27;s small amounts of bitcoin. With the current rates, that&#x27;d have to be like 0.01 BTC ($7). Those would be used to lure people in, going OMG IT WORKS, until they transfer, say, 10 BTC, after which the scammer simply doesn&#x27;t return the money.",1385042349

You only notice you're on a USB adapter when you drag around a window very quickly, or you open Dashboard, and even then - it's not that bad.<p>(is this really an Ask YC question though?)",1256198360

I wish they had just gone straight to Scheme - it would have been mind-altering and a lot of fun.<p>They did have one course which was heavily project based which is the one I remember clearly - write a toy compiler, add a feature to a minix like OS, spellchecker with compressed dictionary etc.",1256197506

Like your brain, the R&D department is part of a complex system that does a lot of important stuff. You can argue that the R&D department is the most important part of a company, not least because it couldn't survive long without it. I think the same thing about my brain--but I'd still be just as dead without my liver. You certainly can't prove anything about my effectiveness as a journalist by pointing out that [my brain] weighs less than my bones. So how big should a ""brain"" be? Hard to say. But let's look at some companies that are generally recognized as pretty innovative, and their R&D as a percentage of revenue:</i><p>Apple:  three cents out of every dollar<p>Google:  ten cents out of every dollar<p>Intel:  fifteen cents out of every dollar<p>Genzyme:  sixteen cents of every dollar<p>US Government:  three cents out of every dollar",1256197085

Asymmetry in the relation ""is smarter than"" simply means that it is impossible to have both ""X is smarter than Y"" and ""Y is smarter than X"" (for X != Y).<p>In the context of individuals of incomparable intellect, it is inappropriate to say that either is smarter than the other -- never mind that they are <i>both</i> smarter than each other.",1256196982

896340,comment,896113,896281,0,0,andreyf,,,"You seem to have more experience than me, but I would hypothesize that learning fundamental physical metaphors just happens very early (and haphazardly) in life, and a lot of what seems to be ""innate intelligence"" is derived from those experiences. Just as linguistic intuition is hard to attain after a certain age, there is spacial, logical, and even epistemological intuition that happens well before the first grade.<p>Seeing a good magic trick at a young age, for example, is probably what leads to true understanding of epistemology - you need that initial feeling of ""reality is not what it seems"". Intuitively understanding logic is also indirect - it can come from a toy peaking a child's curiosity at the just the right time in just the right way.<p>No learning opportunity is missed completely, just as 30-somethings can learn to speak foreign languages, but there are certainly windows for the quick acquisition of certain ideas over others.",1256196673

But don't extrapolate that to also assuming that praising a child for things that really are praise worthy (including being smart) is bad.<p>The result of the study should be: don't lie in your praise.",1256196608
896338,comment,895816,896186,0,0,jstevens85,,,"I think the problems are overstated. There really isn't a web filter debate. It's really a bunch of people yelling at a rogue Labour minister who has too much power as leader of the right faction. There are very few people arguing in favour of the plan, and it looks like it will be impossible to pass through parliament.<p>The lack of an R18+ rating is more a reflection of the problems with the constitution. The federal parliament is unable to make censorship laws that apply to the entire country, and we are therefore dependent upon all six states to agree. The situation now is that 5 states support an 18+ rating, one doesn't.<p>The serious censorship problems are really that several films, such as Ken Park, have been banned even though there exists an 18+ rating for cinema. Also, the banning of one of Philip Nitschke's books is troubling.",1256196584

I remember once, I had been working on a robot for the FIRST competition for about 10 hours straight. I was exhausted, so I thought, 'I'll take a nap in the anechoic chamber'. It was probably the only quiet, dark place around.<p>I couldn't sleep, and lasted only about 20 minutes in the chamber. I didn't have hallucinations, but I did start feeling paranoid and the lack of sensation was (for lack of a better word) intense. I couldn't stand it.

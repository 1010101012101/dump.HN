2648591,comment,2647485,2648481,1,0,oelewapperke,,,"Well the answer you're looking for is that you're right. CO2 is only responsible for a tiny part of global warming. However, there's a feedback loop.<p>The theory is that the climate system is fundamentally unstable. A relatively tiny (but still quite large) amount of warming ""upsets the balance"" and causes warming by increasing water vapor in the athmosphere, the real greenhouse gas, which is a runaway mechanism. Additionally increased heat releases CO2 from the oceans, again increasing the situation.<p>So once CO2 started to cause a tiny bit of warming (probably before or during the 19th century, and more likely volcanic than human in origin), the reaction started, and it's been running ever since.<p>Of course, this does mean that even if all humans died today, after carefully shutting down every car and power plant, global warming wouldn't stop.

The interesting and useful information is what assumptions have gone into making the projections, what understanding of the market is present etc. etc. By questioning the creator of the business plans about all of this you can rapidly find out if they understand their business, their market place and their competition.<p>(I'm not sure how this scales - but for small companies it's critical information. However it certainly works in some situations - IDC are projecting that Microsoft and Nokia will once again be a dominant force in mobile phones, reading the article their assumption seems to be that, Microsoft and Nokia have been dominant in the past and therefore, despite a changing market and any damage they have seemingly done to their own companies, they will be again. Having identified it I can now evaluate that assumption on it's own merits. With a small company this may well be more hidden. Another great example comes to mind: the work song nano cluster episode of Big Bang Theory when Sheldon points out that Penny's business plan will result in her earning considerably less than minimum wage)<p>Projections are not useless - they tell you what people are thinking and how well they understand key things needed to make it succeed.

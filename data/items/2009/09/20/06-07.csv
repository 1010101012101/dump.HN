832834,comment,832615,832755,0,0,psyklic,,,"I found the original article insightful, but this journalist's rebuttals also bring up interesting points.<p>- ""Does content affect price?"" It seems the journalist and PG define ""price"" differently -- is it the price to the consumer or to the publisher? Either way affects profit, so both seem valid to me.<p>Hence, I feel the journalist has a valid point. Laura Bush will command higher royalties. So, the price to the <i>publisher</i> is increased (via higher royalties/advances), because Laura Bush provides desirable content. The journalist also states that while the price to the <i>consumer</i> is not higher, the publishers' business model is to sell more copies at a lower profit margin per copy, which seems perfectly valid.<p>- ""Better journalism is slightly cheaper."" In some cases, yes. In others, no. Arguing over <i>Time</i> vs. <i>The Economist</i> seems to not answer the broader question.",1253429729

You need <i>customers</i> . Whether customers are pulled in my deliberate ""marketing"" or technological superiority providing differential capability depends on the exact offering.<p>If you confine the technology behind  a startup to  things like using open source CMS es as ""building blocks"", then <i>of course</i> technology and programming are commodities, and the ""scarce talent"" is indeed marketing, not programming.<p>I could continue, but my original point was that it was an over broad generalization, which is addressed if you are talking about the kinds of startups using off the shelf building blocks as their ""technology"" and have no real <i>technological</i> differentiator, and therefore don't need excellent programmers (who are very hard to find- just ask anyone running  a ""non cms"" startup.)<p>Under <i>those</i> circumstances, (in other words, with a narrower focus than implied in the original sentence )  the original claim is completely valid.

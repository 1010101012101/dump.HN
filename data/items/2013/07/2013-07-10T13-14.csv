The quality is poor (although doctors are mostly good), and some hospital conditions are close to appalling, but it&#x27;s 100% free (paid by taxpayers blablah), even up to cancer or AIDS treatment (yes, thousands of dollars). Time to treatment is also very bad for surgeries and other conditions.<p>2) Almost-universal healthcare in a co-op mode (Mutualism, &quot;Mutualistas&quot; and FONASA). Anybody who works or draws a pension has the right to one of those for himself and his children. Quality is decent, and there are some small costs associated (U$ 5 per doctor visit, and a few hundred dollars for major events). Medicine is provided by the hospital at an extreme discount (usually U$ 5 for any medicine, including the ones costing hundreds of dollars. Generics are mandatory whenever possible). The thing is, it&#x27;s becoming a bit overcrowded and quality is going down, government is over-regulating IMO.<p>3) Private insurance, US-style. This one can replace 2) although 1) is still free to everybody (double coverage). That one gives access to the very best hospitals, doctors, etc... but it&#x27;s the most expensive by far, and usually doesn&#x27;t cover medicines outside of hospital stay.",1373464268

Subtitles are a derivative work of that which they are created from and should be covered by that copyright.  The creator of the derivative would have a copyright on that derivative but that does not permit them to distribute it without the original work&#x27;s copyright holder&#x27;s permission (and the original work&#x27;s copyright holder would need the derivative&#x27;s copyright holder&#x27;s permission to distribute that.<p>It may be however that there is a fair use argument that could be made in many jurisdictions (based on the intended use being by a licensee of the original work, the accessibility benefits and the (presumably) noncommercial nature of the operation).<p>I would strongly oppose police enforcement rather than civil action and even that would strike me as a bad commercial practice by the movie companies.

Recognizing that fixed price development is very often a nasty trap is where many developers and organizations start to actually wonder about how their business model could change.<p>1. Fixed bid projects. Attempting to offer custom development as a package deal seems like a great way to undercut the competition; in reality it&#x27;s anything but, and (among other things, including those mentioned in the article) reduces the perceived value of your work, which hurts in the long run.<p>2. Hourly consulting. Better, and works well for quite a while, allowing you more flexibility in your engagements and with your rate. This might even be a good long-term strategy for individuals; however, it requires very good planning and workload management, which are more difficult than many people think. It also does limit your earning potential, but this is much more of a factor if you expand into a consultancy, in which case your expenses will drop your margin.<p>3. Product/subscription service development. Often the subject of HN discussion (and rightly so), the prospect of recurring revenue is obviously a powerful one. However, even more than when selling development services, this requires a solid understanding of your target audience(s) <i>and the ability to market to them effectively</i>, in addition to understanding end-user customer support.<p>Where do we go from there?

6019290,comment,6015326,6019068,6,0,chongli,,,"Actually, in Haskell (map print) is pure; it just doesn&#x27;t do what you expect it to:<p><pre><code>    >>> map print [&quot;hello&quot;,&quot;world&quot;,&quot;!&quot;]
    <interactive>:2:1:
    No instance for (Show (IO ())) arising from a use of `print&#x27;
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Show (IO ()))
    In a stmt of an interactive GHCi command: print it
</code></pre>
What&#x27;s going on here? Let&#x27;s look at the type of (map print) to find out:<p><pre><code>    >>> :t (map print)
    (map print) :: Show a => [a] -> [IO ()]
</code></pre>
(map print) is a function which takes a list of values of type <i>a</i> -- such that a can be <i>shown</i> as a String; hence the <i>Show a</i> => constraint -- and returns a list of values of type <i>IO ()</i> (pronounced IO unit). These are monadic values representing computations that perform the actual IO. Hence, (map print) is a pure function which carries no side effects.<p>So, what the heck do we do with this strange list of <i>IO ()</i>s? Well, one answer is to pass them to <i>sequence_</i>:<p><pre><code>    >>> sequence_ (map print [&quot;hello&quot;,&quot;world&quot;,&quot;!&quot;])
    &quot;hello&quot;
    &quot;world&quot;
    &quot;!&quot;
</code></pre>
Ahhh, so now we get to the impure function: sequence_! Actually, sequence_ is a pure function as well. Its type is:<p><pre><code>    >>> :t sequence_
    sequence_ :: Monad m => [m a] -> m ()
</code></pre>
sequence_ merely takes a list of monadic values and combines them into a single monadic value, discarding any of the elements&#x27; return values and returning () instead.<p>So if everything is a pure function, how do we actually perform the side effects? The simplest way to think of it is that our whole program is a bunch of pure functions which construct a single value representing all of the side effects that will take place over the lifetime of the program. This single value is called main:<p><pre><code>    main :: IO ()
    main = sequence_ (map print [&quot;hello&quot;,&quot;world&quot;,&quot;!&quot;])
</code></pre>
With this idea in mind, we can think of Haskell&#x27;s runtime as taking this single value <i>main</i> and performing the side effects specified throughout our program.",1373462768

They were giving them a percentage of the MASSIVE amount of money they made because Mozilla had Google as the default search engine.  Same reason other companies pay for inclusion or being the default in other countries.  Heck, many argue (rather correctly, I say) that one reason for Chrome was so Google could control more of the web and have to pay Mozilla less money.<p>I&#x27;m not a &#x27;Google-basher&#x27; and use many of their cloud products within reason (knowing that they can pull the plug on them or me on a whim and I have zero recourse), but you&#x27;re giving them too much credit.

For over a decade, they&#x27;ve been getting good scores and they&#x27;ve been made to feel that a good score is the inevitable and deserved outcome of &quot;trying&quot;. (The kids for whom this is not true mostly don&#x27;t end up at good colleges.) &quot;If students expect 90-100% scores are possible, and then they start a subject where all of a sudden that&#x27;s not true, then they&#x27;re not going to deal with that well.&quot; And they&#x27;re evaluating you, the professor.<p>As the professor, you&#x27;ve either got tenure and you don&#x27;t need to care toooo much about those evaluations, or you are pre-tenure at a research U and you&#x27;ve got to keep &#x27;em reasonable while you crank out papers, or you&#x27;re pre-tenure at a teaching college and you&#x27;ve got to keep them GOOD. Those evaluations have got to stay above a certain level, though, especially in this job climate. Why go to the trouble of resetting students&#x27; expectations by broaching those subjects students will struggle with? So keep things easy.<p>But then you&#x27;re to a point in math or physics at which you <i>can&#x27;t</i> continue avoiding the topics that are taxing intellectually. So you go into it and your students are sophomores with 13 years of straight As behind them and your star student starts to have a slightly tough time with multivariable Taylor series and she gets a 78% on the second midterm. She&#x27;s totally mortified and gets her grade back up to an A- or B+, but at the end of the semester visits you in your office to apologize and tell you she&#x27;s changing her major to sociology. She realizes that a B+ tells her that she just can&#x27;t succeed in mathematics even though she likes it.<p>And maybe your end-of-semester evaluations for that class are overall pretty good, recovering from the mid-term evaluations that were so stressed out, and you&#x27;ve dealt with the seven requests to take the final late to accommodate vacation or extra study time. Pretty good means you can breathe a sigh of relief in that respect... but you keep thinking about that student who left math because she got one 78% on a midterm.

2710960,comment,2710346,2710346,7,0,ender7,,," - There are designers who care more about the user's experience than the beauty of their graphic design. They obsess about clarity of design, action flow, and how the average person will view or interpret their graphics and layouts, rather than something that is purely elegant or attractive. They work around technical limitations rather than ignore them. Of course, some people simply call these <i>good designers</i>.<p>- There are front-end engineers who care more about how the user perceives the product than how fellow engineers might perceive their architecture. These engineers obsess about things like UI responsiveness, framerates, and page loading times. They take user studies with a grain of salt, but they deeply respect them. They do not like it when other designers or engineers complain about ""stupid users"" that just don't understand their interface. They understand when it's time to scrap a month of work on a UI that just doesn't seem to be clicking, and get on with the next version instead of digging in their heels. Then again, some people just call these <i>good front-end engineers</i>.<p>- There are managers who prioritize the user experience above all else. They make sure the people under them do as well. They personally try out and approve all major product features and liberally cut, prune, and edit where they think things are too confusing. They make the hard decisions. They throw away hard-earned features that just don't quite cut it. They understand that the quality of the final product is <i>their responsibility</i>, and the quality of a product is increasingly being judged almost solely on the quality of its user experience. Sometimes these are just called <i>good managers</i>.<p>IMO, a UX person is just <i>someone who cares</i>. More about the user than about themselves.<p>That said, I think there <i>is</i> a valid new profession somewhere between designer and front-end engineer. Static mock images don't let you explore certain kinds of very dynamic interfaces (touch-based ones especially). The ability to actually program a <i>demo</i> that moves provides incredible insight into the design process, but most designers are incapable of doing so. I don't know what to call such a person, even though I am one.",1309377236

In 1993 I was using it at Sun in network protocol design and I was doing that because people suggested they had used that technique before and it worked well. (so it was known earlier than my use of it)<p>Basically if you have a system where contention is possible but unexpected, you 'tag in' before you start to do things that would be wrong if you did them in contention, and you 'tag out' when you're done. The system keeps track of a mutable state value which gets updated when state is mutated and the 'tag id' of the person who mutated it. When you tag out if you're the only tag id that has been mutating the system your done, otherwise the system resets your changes and you re-do. This 'wins' if most of the time you won't be contended. Its 'safe' because you always detect when it was contended and restart from a safe starting point. You don't 'roll back' generally because if you lost the tag race its because someone else ""won"" it and the new state is again consistent.<p>Surely there is some seminal paper on this somewhere.",1309377128

I'll mostly skip the first three paragraphs of use of anonymity that is good, but I will say it is a bit weird that version control advocacy required anonymity. If there is fear of reprisal from something that most normal developers reasonably advocate for, then there is a culture of fear present, which is nearly always based on past experiences of punishment. Something to look into and perhaps fix there.<p>The last paragraph is where you give an example of bad use of anonymity. You state a situation where someone says X sucks, and it is known that X does suck. This you say is harmful use. But it is not harmful. The person says X sucks, and X does suck. Since you know that X sucks, you yourself and others must know why it sucks. Saying it is not only wrong but <i>harmful</i> to <i>state what is obvious and known</i> at your firm is yet another indication that you have a corporate environment of fear and reprisals. Obviously someone doing ""harm"" should be gotten rid of, therefore, accepting your assertion it is harm, the person should be eliminated.

Unfortunately, a potential new law that may be signed by Governor Brown compels us to terminate this program for California-based participants. It specifically imposes the collection of taxes from consumers on sales by online retailers - including but not limited to those referred by California-based marketing affiliates like you - even if those retailers have no physical presence in the state.<p>We oppose this bill because it is unconstitutional and counterproductive. It is supported by big-box retailers, most of which are based outside California, that seek to harm the affiliate advertising programs of their competitors. Similar legislation in other states has led to job and income losses, and little, if any, new tax revenue. We deeply regret that we must take this action.<p>As a result, we will terminate contracts with all California residents that are participants in the Amazon Associates Program as of the date (if any) that the California law becomes effective. We will send a follow-up notice to you confirming the termination date if the California law is enacted. In the event that the California law does not become effective before September 30, 2011, we withdraw this notice. As of the termination date, California residents will no longer receive advertising fees for sales referred to Amazon.com, Endless.com, MYHABIT.COM or SmallParts.com. Please be assured that all qualifying advertising fees earned on or before the termination date will be processed and paid in full in accordance with the regular payment schedule.<p>You are receiving this email because our records indicate that you are a resident of California. If you are not currently a resident of California, or if you are relocating to another state in the near future, you can manage the details of your Associates account here. And if you relocate to another state in the near future please contact us for reinstatement into the Amazon Associates Program.<p>To avoid confusion, we would like to clarify that this development will only impact our ability to offer the Associates Program to California residents and will not affect their ability to purchase from Amazon.com, Endless.com, MYHABIT.COM or SmallParts.com.<p>We have enjoyed working with you and other California-based participants in the Amazon Associates Program and, if this situation is rectified, would very much welcome the opportunity to re-open our Associates Program to California residents. We are also working on alternative ways to help California residents monetize their websites and we will be sure to contact you when these become available.<p>Regards,<p>The Amazon Associates Team",1309375744

The transition feels a little awkward, and it needs to be very smooth to encourage people to create new overlaps.<p>I'm still playing with it, but I think it's a very neat concept that could get big.<p>EDIT: Okay, if I ""Me Too"" and overlap, I get to see who else did too, over on the right, but it's still one more click to open up our overlaps, a scan through the list, some typing, and another click before I can send them a message about how we both like Nutella.

Unfortunately, a potential new law that may be signed by Governor Brown compels us to terminate this program for California-based participants. It specifically imposes the collection of taxes from consumers on sales by online retailers - including but not limited to those referred by California-based marketing affiliates like you - even if those retailers have no physical presence in the state.<p>We oppose this bill because it is unconstitutional and counterproductive. It is supported by big-box retailers, most of which are based outside California, that seek to harm the affiliate advertising programs of their competitors. Similar legislation in other states has led to job and income losses, and little, if any, new tax revenue. We deeply regret that we must take this action.<p>As a result, we will terminate contracts with all California residents that are participants in the Amazon Associates Program as of the date (if any) that the California law becomes effective. We will send a follow-up notice to you confirming the termination date if the California law is enacted. In the event that the California law does not become effective before September 30, 2011, we withdraw this notice. As of the termination date, California residents will no longer receive advertising fees for sales referred to Amazon.com, Endless.com, MYHABIT.COM or SmallParts.com. Please be assured that all qualifying advertising fees earned on or before the termination date will be processed and paid in full in accordance with the regular payment schedule.""",1309375484

UX developers are people that couldn't find themselves neither as designers or as developers and got stuck in between. Those became so many over the years; people interested not in being perfect at doing one thing, but at being intermediate in everything.
Others are project managers who gained some experience in handling projects, but got bored of all the wire-framing, analysis and actually doing nothing (at least the majority), so they decided to get more involved in projects on a technical/creative level.<p>The first group, the stuck-in-between, become UX designers/developers with a few technical tricks. The second group, the managers, became UX analysts and experts.<p>So, in reality, your job as UX designer/developer, is to make real Designers dumb, by not letting them learn how to create usable designs, but designs that follow your lead and your wire-frames which eventually affect real Designers creativity. Or maybe real Designers are too dumb to learn how to offer the user a good experience!
The UX developers, on the other hand, don't have an actual role. So if you're doing the wire-framing, the analysis, the content management, the information architecture, can you please specify what is a project manager doing?
Plus, if your skills enables you to prototype certain features, what if you're involved in a super complex project, who's gonna prototype now?
I know, the one who actually does the prototyping and is actually a real Programmer that knows his language very well and knows its actual limitations. Not the ones UX developers heard about.<p>The real definition for your job is ripped of from something every human should learn how to do and that's communication.",1309375291

They need to make sure the early adopter community is tight first, kind of like Quora did. Imagine what would've happened if Quora went public from like day one. It would've basically killed the product. Or what if everyone knew about HN from day one? Facebook, too, was once only for college students.

2710776,comment,2710346,2710346,38,0,geebee,,,"As a developer, I have to admit that I feel a lot of ambivalence about this emerging discipline.  It's taken a long time to convince the world of the benefits of a ""developer driven culture"", but I think it's critical to avoid putting developers into a box where they are simply executing specs.   I see a lot of that creeping back in through the new concept of a ""UX Developer"".<p>Here are the three big quotes that are making me nervous:<p>""Its our job to help translate their vision to the development team in a way that they can understand and accept""<p>""Similarly, we need to speak on behalf the developers to help reign in the designers, at times.""<p>""However, for the traditional developer the application works if it executes all of the items listed in the functional specs. The focus of the traditional developer is centered on tasks rather than goals.""<p>Oh man.  So the role of a UX developer is to stand in between the developers and designers and represent the interests of each for us?  All the while, assuming that the mindset of a ""traditional"" developer is to be myopically focused on tasks rather than goals?<p>Everything I read about UX as a skill set I like.  Developers and Designers should be focused on goals. We should strive to acquire the skills and mindset that are often associated with ""UX"" (good developers were doing this long before ""UX"" became a term or job category).<p>Everything I read about UX as an actual job role, I don't like.  I can't stand the idea of a worker in my organization deciding that developers are focused on tasks and need someone running interference between them and the users and designers.<p>As I've pointed out in other discussions around UX on HN, one key question is to ask yourself: would this person be useful on a small team?  A developer or designer with lots of ""UX"" skill would be even more useful on a small team.  But the type of person described through this post?  Not really, and could even do harm by mucking up the relationship between developers, designers, and the things that they actually need to be exposed to to write good software.<p>In short, I believe that UX is a great addition to a developer or designer's skill set, but I'm not at all convinced that it would be a great job category.",1309374543

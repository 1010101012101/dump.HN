They also have a honor's program for CS majors (Turing) that you may be able to get into with okay grades but good experience. But even if you don't get into that program, you'll still be taking classes with those folks.<p>Also think of the relationships between schools to get in the ""back"" door at places where the competition might be higher. For instance, at the Univ of Pittsburgh you can take one course every semester at Carnegie Mellon. The Pitt credits are cheaper but you get the instructors and knowledge at CMU. Of course, your degree would be from Pitt. Still, knowledge matters. I think the same is true of Tufts and MIT/Harvard.<p>A third option is going to a local state school and getting your grades in order to transfer after a year or two. You'll probably be in school a semester or two longer (cause all credits won't transfer), but your degree will have more of a ""name"" and you'll benefit from increased competition/knowledge.<p>EDIT: Sorry if this sounds disparaging of Pitt. I had a great experience there in a combined cogneuro Ph.D. program with CMU. But I know nothing of Pitt's CS department even as the cross-over of the communities made a lasting impression. You'd likely to have to work a bit harder to make those connections as an undergrad. But it is possible.",1214243808

People like to call these ""hands on,"" but it really means ""no theory.""<p>""Better"" schools provide thinkers to the economy.  These schools teach you principles and will make you study Scheme/LISP and implement quicksort and other algorithms like that.

A Google search has an overwhelming amount of advice, maybe someone with a bit of experience could chime in and offer some tips ie compilers, great tutorials and articles, libraries, etc?",1214241020

All successful platforms (yes, every last one of them) started out their life as useful tools with limited scope: the original Macintosh, Unix, Java, Rails, even windows.  All of these things started out as specific products to fill a specific niche.<p>The only plausible counter-example I can think of off-hand is .NET.  But even there, it started out not as a new from-scratch platform, but basically as a clone of Java with some windows-specific bits thrown in.  So maybe a billion is enough if you're just trying to compete, not innovate.",1214240798

I did my time in Univ of Washington and Utah State University, and I definitely feel like I got my money's worth.<p>A warning, though. UW's proximity to MS and the other tech companies made the department really exclusive for undergrads while I was there. I majored in something besides CS, then did my master's in CS later. You'll want to learn about what the department's standards are (eg, competitive admission for starters) so you know what you have to do to get in.<p>I recommend you email or call the department secretaries and ask for some information and a hookup with a current student. Assuming the secretary and the student are helpful, you'll learn a lot about what you need to know.<p>OT, apply for scholarships like crazy. Don't make my mistake.",1214240728

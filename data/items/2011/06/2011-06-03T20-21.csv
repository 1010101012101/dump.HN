India (and China) benefits from what I call as human subsidy. The living standard on average for general population are low which lead to reduction in cost for manpower, which makes stuff cheap. Sure if you are in top 10-20% of the earners, your life is amazing, you can have all the benefits of developed world at the price of developing world. I am not saying that people who live in other place are free of such guilt, consider Americans buying Apple products, made by Chinese workers who live in poverty. However for Indians the guilt is significantly higher. At least Americans can invoke Us vs Them argument, or point out the fact that actually buying the products might be the best thing that they can currently do considering their government.<p>Regarding India,there would be significant inflation in next decade, the main problem will start when our generation enters later thirties. There would be significant stress on India's healthcare system. (Indians might make fun of US healthcare, but Medicare/Medicaid is amazing and there is no equivalent in developing world). Worse India does not even has large army or pressure to grantee energy security. Unless there are groundbreaking inventions in energy/healthcare (which are quite possible) the next two decades are going to be challenging. India's best bet is that its demographic dividend and ageing population in US/Europe, pays out.",1307134240

With these advances in place it makes sense that copyright should be shortened because it allows creators to be compensated more quickly.<p>If you contrast works like the Dan Brown's 'Davinci Code' compared to Mary Shelly's 'Frankenstein' it would stand to reason that Dan Brown was able to be remunerated for his efforts much more quickly than Mary Shelly thus the purpose of copyright can be full filled much more quickly and should be shortened in order to make more works available to the public.

However, it's hard to realistically expect one to go from being the maintainer of a hostile fork to the maintainer of the project they forked overnight.<p>But that having been said, Loren is one of the few people qualified to really speak on these issues. He's studied the internals of RubyGems, he is aware of many of the problems with the previous ways of doing things. In particular, he's a proponent for stable APIs so that breakage becomes a thing of the past. I've spoken with literally hundreds of people over the last two weeks about this issue, and I'll be the first to admit it's one that needs to be solved. The question now is not whether it must be done, but when and how the changes need to be introduced.<p>These are questions that I feel I must at least strongly consider the opinions of the current maintainers of RubyGems on, because for example, Eric Hodel has been the core team for 4 years and knows more about RubyGems than anyone on the planet. There is no denying that Eric+Ryan have had personal conflicts with Loren, which would make an immediate appointment of Loren on the core team unrealistic.<p>However, Evan Phoenix (another of RubyGems maintainers) and I are trying to see if we can find a way to solve this problem outside of RubyGems first through a compatibility gem, in a minimally invasive way to users. We have already talked with Loren some, but I hope that dialogue continues so that he can possibly help us with our ideas and build something that everyone can be happy with. This to me would be much better than the division that would be caused by a fork, and is something I think we should at least try before we make any sweeping changes in leadership.<p>I've promised to back off the diplomacy and start hacking to solve the problem, and that's what I'll do in the coming weeks. But I felt it was necessary to share my thoughts here simply because I've been listening to so many people about what their concerns are with RubyGems, and that makes me really want to find a solution that works. If Loren can be part of that solution, I'd love to see him working for RubyGems rather than against it, for sure.",1307133348

It uses lazy normalization, so conversions happen as needed. This is invisible to the user, but internally there are two different number types.<p>So there's usually already a strong indicator that a variable is an integer or a double just from looking at the internal type. The interpreter usually has two paths for all operations on numbers and the integer path ist the fast path. The JIT compiler adds guards to check for the proper types and emits specialized code.<p>Also, the JIT compiler pro-actively narrows doubles to integers, whenever it's beneficial to do so. The logic is quite involved -- you can take a look at the big comment block in lj_opt_narrow.c.<p>This optimization is also active on e.g. x86/x64, where there's only a single underlying number representation (a double). But I should mention that on x86/x64 it doesn't necessarily pay off to perform _all_ operations on integer types, since this would waste the extra FPU registers and the massive extra bandwidth of the FP units in these chips. The branch unit is already quite busy and you're effectively serializing the code with all of those overflow checks.<p>So the JIT-generated machine code for x86/x64 and for ARM may be quite different for the same inputs. And I'm not talking about the instruction set differences alone.<p>E.g. compare the output of these two commands:<p><pre><code>    luajit -jdump -e ""local x=0; for i=1,100 do x=x+1 end""
    luajit -jdump -e ""local x=0.5; for i=1,100 do x=x+1 end""

    addsd xmm7, xmm0
    add ebp, +0x01
    cmp ebp, +0x64

The generated code for ARM uses either integers + overflow checks or soft-float code:<p><pre><code>    ->LOOP:
    mov   r10, r4
    adds  r4, r4, #1
    blvs  ->exit 2
    add   r11, r11, #1
    cmp   r11, #100
    ble   ->LOOP

    ->LOOP:
    movw  r3, #0
    movt  r3, #16368
    mov   r2, #0
    bl    ->softfp_add
    add   r11, r11, #1
    cmp   r11, #100
    ble   ->LOOP
</code></pre>
Note: the mov r10, r4 is to preserve the value prior to the overflowing calculation in exit 2. Yes, one could avoid that for an addition by undoing the calculation. But this won't work in general, e.g. for a multiplication.",1307132331

The problem with all the failed ""convergent"" entertainment platforms out there (seriously, the market is littered with their carcasses at this point) isn't technical, it's delivery.<p>Some consumers want games, and they're willing to buy a console to get them.  Some consumers want laptops, or tablets, etc...  And these markets self-select for those willing and able to do the installation.<p>But <i>everyone</i> wants TV.  And they want it to just work, and be hand-delivered to their home and installed by a professional who then hands them a remote and walks out.  Until ""convergent"" platforms get to this level of integration (e.g. being installed by Comcast per above), they aren't going to out-compete the cable providers.<p>And the corrolary is that until the convergent platforms get to this level of integration, they'll always be, at best, the quirky, weird cousins of ""real"" TV.  They'll never quite work right, and will always be chasing features or jumping over annoying compatibility hurdles.<p>That's a lesson that tech people don't seem to get, because we're happy to hook up an extra box to our TV, or buy a netflix subscription, or download a torrent.  But that's not what the market wants.  The <i>market wants to pay $100/month to Comcast to not worry about that stuff</i>.",1369160994

Right away you'll run smack into the problem of XML namespaces, which is a feature that every XML library <i>pretends</i> to support, but with a whole bunch of caveats. Before you can do so much as initiate a session, you will need to search the universe of XML libraries for one that implements a full parser and has good namespace support.<p>(When I wrote an XMPP library, I ended up using libxml2 because the only platform I care about is Linux.)<p>Next you'll have to implement encryption (TLS) and authentication (SASL). As with all security-related code, this part of your application is terribly easy to fuck up in a non-obvious-but-user-endangering way. Does your TLS library check that the certificate is valid? Many don't by default. Does your SASL library implement the spec correctly? SASL is complicated and difficult to test, so it's easy for even experienced developers to break authentication for some subset of users.<p>(I used gnutls and gsasl to do most of the heavy lifting, but still ran into many problems. For example, my library doesn't work with some versions of ejabberd because ejabberd's implementation of SCRAM-SHA-1 was broken: <a href=""https://support.process-one.net/browse/EJAB-1632"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.process-one.net/browse/EJAB-1632</a>).<p>OK, so you've found a full-featured XML library, you've figured out TLS and SASL, and you can send ""hello world!"" to another account. Think you're done? Hahaha, no my friend, you're just getting started.<p>To do anything interesting with XMPP, you need to implement XMPP extensions (XEPs). There are currently three hundred and twenty seven XEPs, indexed at <a href=""http://xmpp.org/xmpp-protocols/xmpp-extensions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xmpp.org/xmpp-protocols/xmpp-extensions/</a> , and many of them are at least as large as the core spec itself. XEPs cover such important functionality as multi-user messaging, file transfer, voice/video chat, full encryption, avatars, and away messages.<p>(I decided to skip all that, not do any XEPs at all, and limit my library to simple one-on-one chats because that's all I needed it for. If you're writing something for use by customers, you will not have that luxury.)<p>And of course, it's all implemented in XML. Hope you've got a sturdy keyboard.",1369160207

The tech industry is also heavily subsidized, by design, and is indeed one of the original recipients of such subsidies. Many of the land-grant universities founded in the 1800's were specifically designed to train engineers to go into what was the high-tech industries of the time. Crossing the line from providing people a general education to specifically training people with the skills relevant to a particular industry and thereby reducing that industry's training costs is a form of subsidy, one that continues to this day.",1369159641

The really good ones cost way more than that.<p>I would argue that having a professional portrait is a bit of a ""luxury"" purchase.

Anytime you&#x27;ve got a problem that can be decomposed into distinct subcomponents that only need minimal contact with each other you can keep most the real nasty concurrency issues swept under the carpet. And the functional stuff still feels like it works fairly well to me because it&#x27;s easy enough to model all the different subcomponents as more-or-less idempotent operations on the elements of a message stream.<p>The spot where I&#x27;m finding that functional programming just cannot help me is when I really do need to have all the cooks in the same kitchen to get good performance. Those situations exist in a world of highly refined, weapons-grade side effect, and the only thing to be done for it if you find yourself there is to come to terms with that fact and get on with your job.",1438617593

But I guess that&#x27;s the difference between a hard requirement and a soft requirement on a job posting - you can usually fudge or talk your way around a soft requirement, but not a hard requirement.<p>Additionally, I&#x27;ve estimated that 30-40% of places I&#x27;ve interviewed don&#x27;t really know what position they&#x27;re hiring someone for; or they aren&#x27;t serious about hiring and are just testing the waters to see how good their employees are. Maybe for you that&#x27;s closer to 5-10%? It sounds like you get a lot more informative responses than I get. (But I&#x27;m in system & network administration and virtualization, not software development)<p>For the 6 that would have taken you for $10k less, that sounds like negotiation.

9997010,comment,9994899,9994899,0,0,Ologn,,,"The press, and some people here, are always saying they can&#x27;t find good programmers, and it is certainly something that is overstated.  One reason there aren&#x27;t enough good programmers are people in your situation - you got by for a while programming Javascript and web full stack in Germany, yet now, during an economic boom in tech, you are increasingly having trouble finding work.  As you get older, and if the tech market slows, you could be in worse shape.  You&#x27;re a data point for bright, young people who want to increase their tech skills towards why they should not want to go into IT.<p>That aside, I think you can still get work.  You just sound discouraged after the rejection and sound like you are beginning to think a little fatalistically.  Yes, not having a CS degree hurts you and yes, being at one company for over a decade slightly hurts you (not that much though) and yes, being in your early forties also hurts you.  You don&#x27;t say whether you&#x27;re working that full-time decade long job any more (or maybe I missed it), if you were laid off, that also will hurt you more than if you&#x27;re still working there, companies prefer hiring people already employed.  You are over-discouraged though, you can still get work in this market.<p>You talk about going through many hoops, talking to many people, and a lot of weight given to college.  Which sounds like a lot of applications to big companies.  Only a big company could spend so much effort on each person, put a lot of weight on official credentials etc.  So one thing to do is - don&#x27;t just apply to big companies!  Apply to small and medium sized companies as well.  They often don&#x27;t worry about college degrees as much, you&#x27;re often talking directly to the decision makers right away, if they like you they often have the authority to hire you.  Applying for big companies is fine, but mix it up a little.<p>Another thing - you say companies are interviewing dozens of people for each position.  OK.  What is going to put <i>you</i> over the top?  The answer is different in different situations.  From small to big companies the answer is usually technical and personal.  For technical - picture the people interviewing as being a Gaussian curve with a normal distribution - the x-axis is how technically good you are, the y-axis is how many people reach that level.  Where do you have to be on that curve?  If a friend is bringing you into the company, you have to be in the middle or better.  If you are going into a company cold, you have to be (if you&#x27;re having trouble like you are) one standard deviation above the mean in terms of ability.  If you&#x27;re two standards above the mean, then you should be having no trouble.<p>What you have to realize is most people are in the middle of that bell curve.  Most Javascript programmers can tell you what data types in Javascript are, what the &quot;this&quot; keyword is etc.  You probably can as well.  But if you start digging deeper into how well they know Javascript or frameworks their knowledge is not that deep, and they start mumbling the answers.  The average Javascript programmer with your experience have an almost interchangeable amount of knowledge - they all have the same level of depth.  But every dozen interviews or so you get someone who really knows Javascript and certain frameworks backwards and forwards.  People who know more than you.  When you are interviewed, you should write down the answers afterwards and honestly ask yourself if you explained things clearly and in depth.  Honestly, you should be able to knock <i>every question</i> you are asked out of the park with a very in-depth and clear answer.  Because there are people who are being interviewed who can do this.  Giving some sort of half-answer where I know you know it a little, and then missing a few questions doesn&#x27;t cut it - because most other Javascript programmers with your experience can do the same.  Knowing this cold is what puts you above the pack.<p>Insofar as personality - it depends on the company, the people and how badly they need someone.  Most of the time, if your technical skills are one standard deviation above the norm, and your personality is normal, we usually offer the job.  I&#x27;ve interviewed people with very strong technical skills but their social skills were not just slightly poor but very poor.  They continued answering questions after being told several times that their answer was sufficient, and continued talking even after being told &quot;OK, stop talking&quot;! (obviously things had become a little bizarre on their end when we the interviewers felt we had to tell someone &quot;stop talking&quot; - which they ignored, and continued talking!)  Or people who were great technically but seemed very angry and had their arms folded in front of their chest the entire interview, and made a kind of sarcastic grunt after each question.  Actually I would have even hired that person, but my boss torpedoed him and I wasn&#x27;t surprised.  I mean, I myself have made a faux pas when I have gone on an interview - but at least I knew from the interviewer&#x27;s reaction that I had made one!  Some people seem oblivious.<p>Another thing - just hit up everywhere.  Put your resume on Linkedin, look on Stackoverflow careers, Craigslist jobs board, angel.co jobs, whatever people do in Europe (and also look for remote Javascript positions in San Francisco and elsewhere).  Jobs aren&#x27;t always posted everywhere - if there is a Javascript meetup or jQuery meetup in, say, Berlin, their mailing list might have job postings you can&#x27;t find elsewhere.  See where people are meeting up in your city, or nearby cities, to talk about jQuery or Javascript or full stack web development.  Go out, talk to people.  Pass out your business card.  If you don&#x27;t have one, make one, they&#x27;re not expensive, you can make them same day if necessary at some local print shops.  Your best resource is often letting programmers you already know know you&#x27;re on the market.  Some of this is for future reference though - one reason it&#x27;s good to keep in touch with people once in a while is so you&#x27;re not only contacting them when you want a favor.  Not that them possibly getting a referral bonus for their big company hiring you is exactly that much of a favor.<p>For the longer term (not now), if you think not having a CS degree is blocking you, you might think about getting one, perhaps at night.  It helps in a number of ways - human resources prefers hearing you&#x27;re halfway to having a CS degree to not having one.  It also gives you a technical foundation - you&#x27;ll learn things like what is first normal form, second normal form, third normal form etc. are if you don&#x27;t already know.  Also you meet people and your network can grow - again, that depends on you meeting people and keeping in touch.<p>Another longer term thing - I am an Android programmer.  Android was first released in 2008, but even in 2011 the local Android meetings were pretty empty - we could all sit down at a table in a local bar.  Now local Android meetings sometimes have dozens, if not hundreds of attendees.  I picked a new technology stack which took off (one billion Android phones sold last year).  Lots of companies are looking for senior Android people with a lot of experience, but the only people they have to choose from are those handful people who were sitting around the local Android meetup table in 2011.  Whereas Javascript is 20 years old and Javascript programmers are a bit more a dime a dozen.  The thing though is - there are a lot of local programmers who write Java web backend programs (for Tomcat, or Wildfly/JBoss).  They have a solid job, so why change.  Over the past few years, web has been fading a little, and native iOS and Android have been rising.  It is still to the extent that it is too early to put much weight to it.  It&#x27;s understandable why someone making $120k a year or more with a lot of Java web work around might not take the risk of jumping to an Android job.  Why they wouldn&#x27;t play around with it as a side project is more of a mystery - this is where they start to get into your situation.  Because I can tell you, the middle-aged go-getter guys from our local Java group are always working with the cutting edge so they don&#x27;t fall behind.  They&#x27;re working with Android Tango at the moment, which even I feel is too far ahead of the curve for me.  Although maybe if I was smart I&#x27;d order those $500 tablets and start tinkering with them.<p>You were too complacent over the last decade - it should be obvious to you know.  It&#x27;s not fatal as times are good.  When you get your next job, you have to make an effort to get a diploma, keep up with the latest technology, keep in touch with people and so forth, or you&#x27;ll be in a worse situation next time around.",1438617538

(I fudge the year based on memory and how there are various effective years, e.g. there&#x27;s the usually but not always a calendar year for tax rates (and some are retroactive in various ways!), they have to be fully payed in the next year, and the Federal fiscal year runs October 1 to September 30, e.g. 2016 starts October 1st, 2015.<p>All Krugman argues in that column you linked to is how we calculate the magnitude of the increase, he doesn&#x27;t deny there wasn&#x27;t a substantial one, he says 19% for 1980-88.  Which of course substantially understates the reality (but also note you need to adjust for inflation, it was roaring when Reagan entered office, and the prime rate was 20% or greater (!)), since that includes the period before the rates fully changed after which people, including my father, changed their business behavior.<p>Ah, here&#x27;s a table with accurate figures for all three types of income, &quot;ordinary&quot; AKA &quot;unearned&quot; (things like interest), &quot;earned&quot; (wages) and realized capital gains, <a href=""http://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/course/Labortaxes/taxableincome/taxableincome_attach.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/course/Labortaxes/taxableincom...</a> page 4 table A1, note Carter radically reduced the latter from 39.9%, also e.g. deregulated airlines and trucking, and note the JFK rate cuts from &quot;I like Ike???&quot; 91% !!! for income (and also note Reagan started indexing various details for inflation):<p><pre><code>  1980 70.0 50.0 28.0\n  1981 68.8 50.0 23.7\n  1982 50.0 50.0 20.0\n  1987 38.5 38.5 28.0\n  1988 28.8 28.0 28.0\n</code></pre>\nNote again how the 1986 changes immediately increased capital gains tax rates while phasing in the income tax cuts.<p>The history of this is ferociously complicated, I haven&#x27;t even mentioned the FICA rate increases, who&#x27;s large excesses went into the general budget, filling Al Gore&#x27;s infamous &quot;lock box&quot; with unmarketable Federal government IOUs (bonds).  I &quot;know&quot; as much as I do since I came of age in the &#x27;70s, when all this really started to get out of hand, Nixon closed the gold window (for foreigners, FDR did for us in 1933), we were again allowed to own bullion gold, Nixon did his wage and price controls, the Yom-Kippur War resulted in an oil embargo, contemporaneously OPEC at least partly legitimately increased dollar oil prices since the dollar was being devalued (see gold window above), government control of oil and gas was retained when the wage and price controls were generally relaxed, all that resulted in the &#x27;70s &quot;energy crisis&quot;, which ended when Reagan ended the controls, Carter&#x27;s obsession with oil &quot;windfall profits&quot;, etc. etc. etc.<p>Seriously, in many ways the economic history of the last decade and a half has been simpler....",1438617484

9996890,comment,9994899,9996456,0,0,doktrin,,,"There are several reasons younger developers are sometimes valued over older candidates. Work life balance is part of it, but there are other factors at play. This is a pretty well trodden topic, and you can find a lot of the typical discussion points by Googling. A common explanation, for instance, is that experience in tech doesn&#x27;t accrue a ton of value due to tech obsolescence - 20 Cobol experience doesn&#x27;t really translate to much of anything these days.<p>However, rather than re-hash all that, it&#x27;s worth taking a look at the numbers - numbers that absolutely indicate a younger skewing workforce. For instance, the average age at Facebook is 26, and 31 at Google. Tech as a whole leans young, with the &quot;oldest&quot; tech company workforce (HP) still younger than the national median [1]<p>Now, whether simply having a younger workforce points towards actual age discrimination is a matter of fair debate. A perfectly reasonable explanation might be that tech is a young field, hence a young workforce. However, there are enough confounding factors (limitations of experience, work/life balance in dev roles, etc.) that certainly make for rational arguments in favor of age being more of burden than boon.<p>Then, of course, you have stuff like this :<p>> &quot;Young people are just smarter. Why are most chess masters under 30? I don&#x27;t know. Young people just have simpler lives. We may not own a car. We may not have family. Simplicity in life allows you to focus on what&#x27;s important.&quot; -- Zuckerberg<p>True or not, it would be weird to argue that his opinion is somehow a rare isolated outlier. It speaks to a common conception - both in the valley and in tech - that this is a business for the young.<p>[1] <a href=""http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/05/technology-workers-are-young-really-young"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/05/technology-workers-...</a>",1438616842

We&#x27;re looking to hire a new security engineer. Simple is a subsidiary of BBVA Compass that seeks to add superior engineering and transparent policies to the banking world. We&#x27;ve been around since 2009 and we have about 260 employees.<p>Our security group is split into two teams - Security Operations and Security Governance. SecOps builds security software and features for our customers and employees (like two-factor authentication) and Security Governance performs security assessments on our existing and pre-release software. You would be joining me on the Security Governance team, doing web and mobile penetration tests, source code review and incident response.<p>In this role, you&#x27;ll be working through different parts of our frontend, backend and internal software and breaking it any and every way you can. You&#x27;ll be working closely with the software engineering teams as a resident security authority. You&#x27;ll also be checking IDS logs and working with tools like ThreatStack, CrowdStrike, Suricata, etc. Prior experience with those exact tools is helpful but not necessary, we&#x27;ll get you up to speed regardless. More important is the ability to find real security flaws in applications and spot problems with source code.<p>This is an ideal job for those who are technically competent and tired of working as a security consultant (however, you do not need to have been a consultant, we will consider virtually any background as long as you have solid skills).<p>Some report writing will be required for you to document and track vulnerabilities, but you will not be using pages and pages of methodology or vulnerability diagram boilerplate. Most reports are about a page with a much simpler template, and posted right to GitHub. You&#x27;ll be doing more direct communication with engineers via IRC or Zoom about vulnerabilities you find than you will be writing a report about it.<p>Speaking of GitHub, we use it for everything. Even our HR and marketing teams use GitHub. We are a very engineering-heavy organization. We also offer a lot of support for remote employees - I work fully remote from NYC. We use a private IRC server and Slack for chat, Zoom for video conferencing and we even have two Double Robotics robots in our office to remote into.<p>Finally, our tech stack consists of mostly Scala and Java on the backend and mostly JavaScript and Ruby on the frontend. We also use Python, R, Clojure and C for certain tools. People are free to write in whatever they want as long as it&#x27;s effective. We also use AWS.<p>You can see the full, slightly more HR&#x27;d job description here: <a href=""http://banksimple.theresumator.com/apply/b9GKYw/Information-Security-Governance-Engineer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://banksimple.theresumator.com/apply/b9GKYw/Information-...</a><p>Feel free to shoot me an email at dsaccomanni@simple.com, I&#x27;ll be glad to talk more about the company or the role.

I was planning to expand a thought about how it&#x27;s always the rich who casually conclude that lower taxes and less welfare will help the economy.<p>&quot;Can people who are part of the lower earning rung of society give a unbiased opinion of the system?&quot;<p>In a democracy, yes, they do. Someone who is lower down on the earning rung of society (say earning the median US income), has a far more accurate view of the &quot;average&quot; society than someone who is at the very top, merely because they represent an average citizen.<p>&quot;Yes the evidence does speak for itself. Capitalism worked out pretty great for much of Western Civilization. Everywhere where more socialist approaches were tried it failed. Just ask all soviet countries&#x27;, Japan, East Germany, China etc. citizens if they are happy.&quot;<p>East Germany no longer exists and Russia is essentially a dictatorship with a very powerful upper class of plutocrats, not unlike the US. The happiest countries in the world are Switzerland, Iceland, Denmark, Norway and Canada according to the World Happiness index. Do you notice a trend among those countries?<p>&quot;America is not for nothing the land of opportunity, and it is not for nothing that emigrants are flocking to the USA, Europe and Australia.&quot;<p>Denmark has twice the social mobility of &quot;the land of opportunity&quot; as defined by the probability of someone born in the poorest 25% of society making his/her way up to the richest 25% of society within their lifetime. I don&#x27;t think America is the land of opportunity, unless you count the children of the rich who were shuttled into Ivy Leagues as those with opportunity.<p>&quot;Unfortunately the soviets discovered you cannot have a classless society. It is that drive to elevate yourself to a higher class that makes us want to achieve more than the absolute minimum required effort.&quot;<p>I do not disagree, it is impossible to have a completely classless society. But that does not mean that the lowest class cannot have a decent quality of life and financial security. I think it begins with education. After all, only 5.7% of the US population has an education above high-school level. (obviously skewed by <18s, but still a shocking number)",1438616581

To take an extreme example, I might like the brutal open-world genre a la Dark Souls and complain that the Forza games are all garbage because they aren&#x27;t that. Most would recognize this complaint as silly, because if I want a brutal open world with no hits I should find a game that purports to contain that, not go bashing racing games because I don&#x27;t like that genre as much.<p>What the author&#x27;s doing to Zelda obviously isn&#x27;t as extreme, and it is a bit more grounded (Zelda games did used to be more like what the author wanted). But it&#x27;s the same type of argument: back when there were no open world games, the author played one called Zelda and really liked it. Since then (starting with the third), almost /every single title in the series/ has been an extremely dungeon-focused, puzzle-focused game. The overworld has always been a big part, and there have always been some secrets, but the defining aspect of the genre has become these dungeons and puzzles.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say the complaints are invalid; there&#x27;s nothing wrong with wanting a game that is more hidden, less hand-holding, more focused on the action and less on the gimmicks that let you solve a puzzle. But that&#x27;s not asking for a better version of Zelda, that&#x27;s asking for a different genre altogether. Focus on asking for new titles in that genre, and leave other genres in peace.",1438616476

Even then a couple of things take forever to find.<p>I like what the author says but when you have to find something and you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re looking for you have to resort to a brute-force search.  The original Zelda&#x27;s overworld had 16x11=176 blocks per screen and was 16x8=128 screens.  At a minute per screen that&#x27;s two hours to do a rough exploration of the entire overworld.  Twilight Princess is roughly four times the map size* and 8 hours looks like a long time to explore.<p>Compounding the problem is in the original Zelda a rock was pushable/not-pushable, a tree was burnable/not-burnable, a wall was bombable/not-bombable.  That binary &quot;I have checked this/I have not checked this&quot; has largely disappeared.  Not to mention 2-D vs 3-D.<p>Basically there is no fast Zelda Search Algorithm so either the game A) has a small map size, B) limits where the user needs to search, or C) takes forever.<p>*-<a href=""http://www.ign.com/boards/threads/the-size-of-hyrule-area-comparison.188648711/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ign.com/boards/threads/the-size-of-hyrule-area-co...</a>",1438616451

From my observation, when standards are actually under development and look like they will have first class support in the browser, proliferation of stopgap solutions is much lower because people would rather wait for &quot;standard&quot; support of whatever feature they&#x27;re trying to implement.  Also I think that aside from IE, browsers do a good job of getting standard features done, which is sort of amazing considering they don&#x27;t have the &quot;benefit&quot; of top-down bureaucratic governance like the &quot;native&quot; platforms.

We&#x27;ve built an index of the code in iOS and Android apps, so we can quickly answer detailed questions about how they were built.<p>In this case, the Android NDK does not include OpenSSL (libssl and libcrypto), so developers have had to come up with their own approach. The correct one is to statically link your native extension with your own copy of OpenSSL or include a dynamic (.so) copy of it in your APK. But some developers were retrieving the library from a random Android device to link against, but then relying on the OS to provide exactly those same symbols.<p>That assumption failed when Google moved to BoringSSL, Adam Langley&#x27;s rewrite to improve security. He had to change some APIs and thus break binary compatibility.<p>The problem is, nobody knew which apps have this problem. They will continue to work fine until run on the newest Android devices with Android M, such as the Galaxy S6, Note 4, and Nexus.<p>We scanned our index for apps that had native code, matched each app&#x27;s binaries against libcrypto.so and libssl.so, and built a graph of each dependency linkage. Then we could trace the graph to find apps that had this flaw and exactly which of their libraries was at fault.<p>If you&#x27;re a developer, I&#x27;m interested in hearing what you think.",1438615783

9996583,comment,9994032,9995953,0,0,tomvbussel,,,"I mostly agree with you.<p>From an engineering standpoint I think that Hyperion is an amazing renderer and I&#x27;d love to dig into its source code. From an academic standpoint however I think that their paper on it wasn&#x27;t very interesting. I don&#x27;t mind reading about the details of a production renderer, as there is a whole lot of info on writing production renderers. But I don&#x27;t think that it should have been published at EGSR. There were no real new ideas in that paper that were worth publishing. The paper could have had some merit if they provided a good comparison between their architecture and other architectures, but sadly they decided to compare their renderer with other off the shelf renderers. Very little is known about the architectures of those renderers and as they all have their own implementations of acceleration structures, texturing and other shared components, they aren&#x27;t comparable at all. It would have been much nicer if they implemented their algorithm in a framework such as Mitsuba, so that it could be compared with other algorithms.<p>I do think you should give them more credit on the engineering side though. Using large amounts of geometry has been done before, but renderers such as RenderMan and Arnold require that all geometry fits in the memory at once. Tracing large batches of rays at the same time allows you to load in or subdivide geometry on demand, which makes the size of the harddrive and the size of the individual meshes the limit, instead of the memory being the limit. Their scheme also allows for creating good ray packets, which clearly is needed if we want to reap the benefits of Moore&#x27;s law, as those extra transistors mostly translate to wider SIMD vectors instead of higher clockspeeds and simply increasing the amount of children of a BVH node won&#x27;t scale well. Reordering the rays allows you to create coherent packets out of incoherent rays and it allows you to efficiently handle motion blur, as all rays in a packet need to be in the same time interval, which allows you to efficiently make use of those wider SIMD vectors.<p>I&#x27;m certain they could have produced Big Hero 6 without Hyperion, but Hyperion gave their artists a lot of freedom by removing some of the technical limitations.",1438615277

Both languages are horrible, but were incredibly easy to learn. No one taught me, I played with them until I learned, and back then there was no internet.<p>There are so many aspects of Ruby that make it well suited for teaching kids about programming that go WAY, WAY beyond the ridiculous observations you&#x27;ve made. You might as well have pointed out the performance limitations of Ruby too. Installing Ruby is as easy as opening a macbook. It&#x27;s already there. It&#x27;s not like little kids, learning the language for the first time are provisioning servers and installing from scratch.<p>It&#x27;s not a matter of Ruby programmers being emotionally invested. It&#x27;s a matter of Ruby, very often, being the right tool for the job. And for teaching purposes, I don&#x27;t think anything else comes close. The fact that just about everything in Ruby is an object makes for some very interesting syntactical niceties that a child&#x27;s mind can easily grasp. For children, the higher level the language, the easier it will be to grasp and remember.

We’re a pretty small team (currently 14 people) so you’ll have plenty of say around how we develop software going forward.<p>We are currently in the process of modernizing our software platform to be more modular and truly data driven.

Some of the technologies that we’re using: Dropwizard, Swagger, Flyway, AngularJS, Bootstrap, CloudFormation, Troposphere, and Ansible. All new engineers get company provided downtown parking, flexible work hours, 100% of their health insurance premiums paid for by the company, the ability to build their own work computer, and access to our kitchen with plenty of drinks and snacks. We’re looking for individuals only so please NO RECRUITERS OR AGENCIES (seriously, your emails will just go into the trash folder so let&#x27;s save each other&#x27;s time).

9996511,comment,9994899,9994899,0,0,kfk,,,"One reason I stayed in finance is that the programming scene is very fragmented. Some people say everybody that can do a print &quot;hi&quot; gets a job, yet many job advertisements come with increasing requirements. Startups keep looking for the 0.1%, whatever that means, that tells me that there is, indeed, strong competition for candidates (and that I have a 99.9% chance of not getting any job in those startups). Finally, age does come into play, one thing is to go into this at 20, another is at 30 and even another a 40, etc.<p>There is a lot of survival bias. So far, I did not hear any salary higher than 50k euro from face to face talk in Germany (mine is higher, with no coding job). Thus, I am also not clear how real is to have one of those $100k+ salaries just doing &quot;normal&quot; coding (no managerial stuff). If that were possible and achievable even in a 3 years span, I&#x27;d definitely jump into it, but reality tells me it&#x27;s not. At least out of the tech hubs (SV, etc.), but then the 0.1% thing kicks in, so you have a 99.9% chance of not getting any of those jobs, while you have plenty of opportunity to get a steady carrier just where you are.<p>And finally, programming will go through some kind of &quot;commoditization&quot;, it&#x27;s already happening. It might be good to &quot;only&quot; be coding today, but 10 years from now, older and with kids (so no possibility to work week ends anymore), this will probably not be enough and will move you more towards the unemployable zone.<p>Just some thoughts from an ex-wannabe programmer.",1438614912

In the tech industry, we have been on the receiving end of some killer productivity apps. Some of our favorites include Asana, Yammer and Slack. These apps have completely changed the way we work… unless you’re part of the half of the economy that doesn’t sit at a desk. Try using these apps 100% of the time on a mobile device and you’ll likely grow frustrated. Worse yet, these apps were imagined using the use cases of product managers and engineers, not bartenders, hotel workers, contractors or similar jobs. The existing apps are just too hard to use and fundamentally miss on solving the problems workers in these industries face.<p>Crew tries to take what we’ve learned about productivity for desk-bound workers and make that more compatible for other industries. Crew currently consists of multiple “modules”: Messaging — Before using Crew, many of our users were using a mix of text messages and emails, with some using consumer messaging apps like WhatsApp and GroupMe. Crew makes messaging much easier by allowing a manager to add employees to a central directory, enabling employees to communicate without trading phone numbers (both a convenience and actually a safety concern in some companies). Scheduling — Coordination around shifts is one of the top concerns in the businesses of many of our customers. Employees have shift schedules which can vary from week to week and employers get burned when shifts are busted (no-shows). Crew makes it easy to post the shift schedule and then coordinate shift swapping when necessary. Task Management — Did you know that many restaurants have a “chore board” in the back? An actual chalkboard or piece of paper posted letting everyone know what has to get done today. Tasks replaces the chore board with a ticketing system.<p>We have new modules currently under development but what we’ve released thus far has already received a warm reception. Despite only having been available since April, Crew is growing very fast and is frequently ranked in the top 100 Business apps on both Google Play and iTunes. The traction we’ve gotten has helped us raise a seed round. Our backend is a highly automated deployment in EC2 that utilizes auto scaling along with many AWS features. Currently our client consist of an iOS, Android and Webapp utilizing a common infrastructure to communicate. The communication and data infrastructure is written in Node.js and Java (Spring) with heavy reliance on Mongo, Redis and ActiveMQ. This stack allows us to meet our goal of having a linear scalable application that targets zero downtime. The webapp is a Node.js Express application that utilizes Backbone, Require.js and Bootstrap to deliver a responsive and highly performant experience.",1438614662

Still, it has ticked a lot of the same &quot;boxes&quot; for me.<p>Ideally, it&#x27;s a community that&#x27;s based on participation.  When you go to a burn, the idea is to bring something to contribute, whether it&#x27;s interactive art to play with, food to share, a bar with great cocktails, or a comfortable place where people can hang out and relax in the shade.<p>I enjoy it because it provides both an outlet for my creative/artsy interests as well as my enjoyment of building things and working on interesting projects with other people.<p>When I go to one of the burn events, there are more people interested in talking to me and working with me on stuff than just about anywhere I&#x27;ve been and I&#x27;d imagine this is a lot like the hacker space scene.  It&#x27;s been a fun way to meet people with similar (or different) interests whereas at work I only interact with one or two people who I might do those sorts of things outside of the office.<p>If I go to another region or town, I can be reasonably assured that if there is a burner community, I&#x27;d have a place to socialize and meet people to work on projects with.  The concept has spread worldwide so burners or people with similar interests are easier to find than I would&#x27;ve imagined.<p>As far as initiations and rituals, there are some good examples.  The &quot;burn night&quot; is like a huge communal party and walking around I get wished a &quot;happy Burnday&quot;.  When you arrive (especially as a &quot;virgin&quot; at your first event) you can get a playful spank with a paddle or (if you don&#x27;t want such a thing) maybe a hug or at least some smiles.  People often give nicknames known as &quot;burn names&quot; or &quot;playa names&quot; that are probably closest to the nicknames people get in the military (sometimes jokingly deprecating, sometimes honorific, etc).<p>Instead of strict commandments or laws, there are principles.  Principles allow for interpretation and discussion but still provide a framework and a unifying set of things most participants value to at least some level.  Examples are participation, civic responsibility, communal effort, gifting, de-commodification, self-expression, and leaving no trace (since the events typically take place in a camping setting).<p>I know that Burning Man and the associated regional scenes have a reputation as being just big parties all about debauchery and crazy outfits (or none at all).  While there is certainly an element of hedonism should you desire it, the communal effort and focus on working together and being yourself while not hurting anyone else or the community have really impressed me.<p>I&#x27;ve been going to some regional events for several years now and while I don&#x27;t live the stereotypical &quot;burner&quot; lifestyle every day, I love having a community in most places I go and a group of people I can meet up with and find those with common interests who want to work on projects together.<p>And the best part is you get to share all of those projects and brainstorms with loads of other people when you attend one of the events.  It&#x27;s like a huge artsy, techie pot-luck where everyone brings something to share and gets to go try all the things the other people brought along.  I&#x27;m always astounded by the amount of creativity, talent, and work on display when you get several people (or several thousand) all trying to bring their &quot;A-game&quot; to share with everyone else.",1438614660

If you’ve got both, all the better!  Please see our full job descriptions here: <a href=""http://www.atomwise.com/careers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.atomwise.com/careers/</a>",1438614052

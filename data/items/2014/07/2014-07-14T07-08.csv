I&#x27;m looking for ways to get <i>dis</i>connected these days; I don&#x27;t want another gizmo that tracks my existence and pushes useless information at me. The article nonchalantly throws in how the smartwatch is gaining traction from SV due to its potential as <i>yet another platform for people to buy stuff on</i> , as if making a customer&#x27;s life better has somehow become an afterthought. Why don&#x27;t companies even pretend to care anymore?<p>2. Most importantly, automatic watches are amazing and one of the coolest things about owning a watch is marveling at the intricacies of it. There&#x27;s a certain &#x27;magic&#x27; missing from digital watches that I hope future smartwatch makers learn to replicate. Things like IEEE 802.15.4 give me hope that there&#x27;s a way to bring these two worlds together.",1405324726

8029927,comment,8029162,8029544,8,0,mrweasel,,,"While I like the idea of a three day weekend, aren&#x27;t you addressing a difference problem? The swedish experiment is seeking to increase productivity and decrease the time employees spend being sick. You&#x27;re trying to compensate for a distruptive work environment by moving a large part of your workday. It would make more sense to address the things that keep you from doing your job effectively. If you&#x27;re correct, it wouldn&#x27;t be unreasonable to assume that you could work 8 hour days, four days a week and be just a productive and allowing a three day weekend.<p>The issue is of cause that in many large companies some people jobs are more or less defined as keeping you from doing yours. The owner of a Danish consulting company once postulated that: &quot;Many larger (Danish) companies could fire all of their CUSTOMERS, and 40 - 60% of the employees would still have a job to do.&quot; - His point being that a large part of the workforce isn&#x27;t in anyway related to providing services or products to the customers. Having worked for a large telco, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if he&#x27;s right. The point is that a portion of these people, which doesn&#x27;t really produce anything will eventually do something that distrupt the &quot;makers&quot;, because they need to make their presents known.",1405323944

It&#x27;s never going to get any better, don&#x27;t look for it, be happy with what you got.  Because the owners of this country don&#x27;t want that.  I&#x27;m talking about the real owners, now.  The real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions. Forget the politicians, they&#x27;re an irrelevancy. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don&#x27;t. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. They&#x27;ve long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the statehouses, the city halls. They&#x27;ve got the judges in their back pockets. And they own all the big media companies, so that they control just about all of the news and information you hear. They&#x27;ve got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying,\u00AD lobbying to get what they want. Well, we know what they want; they want more for themselves and less for everybody else.<p>But I&#x27;ll tell you what they don&#x27;t want. They don&#x27;t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don&#x27;t want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking. They&#x27;re not interested in that. That doesn&#x27;t help them. That&#x27;s against their interests. They don&#x27;t want people who are smart enough to sit around the kitchen table and figure out how badly they&#x27;re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago.<p>You know what they want? Obedient workers,\u00AD people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork but just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, reduced benefits, the end of overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it. And, now, they&#x27;re coming for your Social Security. They want your fucking retirement money. They want it back, so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.  And you know something? They&#x27;ll get it. They&#x27;ll get it all, sooner or later, because they own this fucking place. It&#x27;s a big club, and you ain&#x27;t in it. You and I are not in the big club.&quot; - George Carlin<p>There&#x27;s your answer to why.<p>The answer to how involves more details, but it basically has to do with pacifying the concept of critical thinking from our education system and all facets of american culture, and replacing it with rote learning. It&#x27;s a lower form of intelligence, which is great for passing arbitrary tests and producing the obedient workers who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork.<p>The best thing you can do for a child is teach them how to think and learn for themselves.

This is certainly not the case with &quot;Jewish&quot;. Jews have identified with other Jews for centuries. You can&#x27;t even go back a single century before your pan-European notion of &quot;white&quot; identity breaks down. English-descended people refused to consider Spanish and Italian-descended people as &quot;white&quot;. Even German Nazis didn&#x27;t consider themselves the same race as Slavic people. The entire notion of ethnic identity is based on a shared history, and there&#x27;s no shared history between Bosniaks and Basques that would meaningfully exclude any non-whites.<p>So I ask, why do people try and advance this ahistoric &quot;white&quot; identity out of nothing?

Unless you care about fashion, there&#x27;s no real need to have something 24/7 on your wrist just to indicate the hour or do trivial other tasks. The screen estate is too small to do anything really interesting anyway, and power-wise it&#x27;s going to be limited by the form factor as well. I have never thought of watches as being great ideas in the first place once we were carrying multi-functions devices with us (like phones), Smartwatches even less.<p>EDIT: as for sensors, yeah, sure, but then I don&#x27;t really need a display, I&#x27;d rather access the data through other means (phone, computer via bluetooth, etc).",1405321983

8029805,comment,8029107,8029488,7,0,tfb,,,"> You sure as hell deserve it.<p>Without a doubt.  I&#x27;ve spent countless hours myself developing a mod for an old gaming community with some of the most unappreciative manchildren (trolls) in existence, and I saw it through to the end because I felt I had an obligation to finish it.  And to this day, there are a handful of people from a subset of that community who blame me for the demise of said subset, even though I did everything they asked.<p>I learned a lot from it though, and not just about coding and development, but about communities in general.  The entitlement that some people feel they have of your time can be astounding.  Apparently when you do things for people for free out kindness or out of passion for something, it only leads some (many?) of them to expect you to continue to do it all, until they&#x27;ve sucked every bit out of you that they can.  I&#x27;m sure this is especially worse in online communities, because to them, you&#x27;re just text on their screen who provides them with something fun or useful, not a human being.<p>So yeah.  Take a break.  A week may not even be long enough.  Work on other things, completely unrelated things.  It&#x27;ll give you a fresh perspective and help with realizing exactly how much time and energy of your life you&#x27;re devoting towards something and how much of it is really worth it.",1405321670

577198,comment,577166,577191,0,0,spitfire,,,"Normally I would agree. But the circumstances of the current depression are different. There was such a bubble in the middle classes due to living on credit that the yuppies in particular will be hit very, very, very, very hard. See AMEX's recent earnings conference call for details.<p>The fact is that for years people were living the life not based on real earnings, but on credit. And those that were living on real earning were often earning money from those who were spending on credit. When credit goes away as it has, both groups become poor. Hence yuppies become poor.<p>The price deflation of mid/upper range houses, bmw's,\naudi's, hotel rooms, travel, wine and jewlery shows this\nclearly.<p>PS: Could you please provide some proof that yuppies fair well in depressions/recessions? My evidence suggest they're usually the ones in the middle of whatever bubble activity. \nAs is certainly the case currently.<p>EDIT: Added extra Very's for emphasis.",1240563519

577190,comment,577166,577177,0,0,thomaspaine,,,"Calling any business that caters to a middle or upper middle class lifestyle tacky seems a little short sighted to me. Yes, times are rough and people are currently cutting back on this kind of thing because this sector of the economy is heavily affected by business cycles. The timing might not be the best, but that isn't to say that in the long run this type of business can't succeed, or maybe even succeed to a lesser extent in the short run. I mean, what kind of entrepreneur would you be if you thought that your business was only viable during booms.",1240562852

577184,comment,577065,577150,0,0,jamesheroku,,,"That's interesting feedback, thanks.  Sounds like two different issues:<p>1. Database pricing.  We aren't trying to sell storage space, that's not the value you're getting with a Heroku db plan.  We would argue that the value is the instant, provisionless nature of the platform - radically faster deployment and scaling, and an environment that just works.  So if those features of the platform aren't valuable to you (i.e. you want to provision, configure, and maintain the db yourself), and you're just looking for the best cost/MB, we're definitely not the right answer for you.<p>Let's say you set that comparison aside for a moment, and you took one of your apps that's providing value to you and selected a Heroku pricing configuration that fits the app's needs.  Given the value of your app plus the value you get from our platform, is the total price worth it?<p>2. Pricing on query execution time, compute cycles, etc.  Why is this appealing to you?  Is it because those numbers make more sense to you, or because you think if we priced on those units it would make the platform less expensive for you?<p>Thanks again for your feedback - interesting stuff.",1240562440

577176,story,,,6,13,wlievens,"Does my project have any value?",,"This is a post about a personal project, so if you lose interest halfway, I apologize. This is not a review-my-website post, I'm not looking for usability advice (yet).<p>Over the past few years I've worked on a browser game project. It's very niche and therefore very small, and thereby not financially interesting (current revenue is about $250 per year). It does however have a loyal following of a couple hundred people who use the game site on a daily basis. I've been wondering whether I should increase my dedication to this project (I've been slacking on it the past half year) or just let it be in its current state. Ideally I'd like to get some decent revenue out of this. It's probably not feasible to get a full-time income out of it, but I'd surely appreciate a nice extra on the side to justify the time I put in it.<p>The project is a political browser game. It simulates elections in which you control a party, and you vote on bills and such to establish yourself in the political landscape. I have a ""Classic"" version (up since '05) and an alpha of the new version (up since '08). The code base is huge so it's been a pretty large investment in terms of hours.<p>So I'll evaluate my project's pros and cons here:<p><i>Cons</i><p>* The website looks like crap. Even the new version looks unprofessional. I'm not a designer, but I do realize that its looks need a lot of work. I'm not really looking for usability advice here since that would take up a whole thread on itself.<p>* It's a niche subject, which means it can't scale indefinitely.<p>* Gameplay for a single game world actually depends on <1000 player population, so it's really not scaling-friendly.<p>* I could be putting my time into something more dollar-efficient.<p>* Time-intensive: politics can be controversial and personal, so a lot of effort goes into moderation. This is mostly handled by the community though.<p>* Aside from google ads, the occasional donation and wacky one-time actions like selling a virtual island, there's no business model.<p><i>Pros</i><p>* Very dedicated player base (players typically hang out for years).<p>* One of a kind: it's the only political game that offers this kind of depth. Competing games in the same space are little more than glorified social networks and my players appreciate the difference.<p>* I get around 10,000 page views and 300 uniques per day. That's peanuts, but it's a lot more than zero.<p>* I like the project personally, but I often doubt whether the hours I invest are at all justified.<p>* As stated above, there is some revenue, though neglegible.<p>The game site is http://www.particracy.net/\nMake sure to check out both the Classic and Alpha versions.<p>Thanks for the feedback.",1240561716

My expertise is on the production & post production side - the logistics of planning, shooting editing and delivering video. Business and raising capital, not so much.<p>About half of this is mine; the original was much more sale-sy and less business-y. There are two of us, the host/creator has sunk a lot of equity into it, it'sa  good product but it needs recapitalizing. I've been working free on this for the last month. I suck at business; I need to be the CTO and manage the manufacture and delivery of the product, which is plenty of work for one person.<p>For confidentiality reasons, I've left out the financials. In brief, we're looking to raise up to $500k and thinking of a 10-15% risk premium with full recap in 3-5, plus 1-2% of net.

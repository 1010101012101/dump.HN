3844203,story,,,1,0,collegestudent,"Ask HN: Seeking help with a sticky college situation.",,"Hello HN,<p>I'm posting this with a throwaway account, because I'd prefer to remain anonymous.<p>I love hacking and programming, I started at a very young age and continue to work on projects. I've done volunteer development work in third world countries, released an iPhone app at 15, and have been working as a software engineer at a web startup since September 2011. I love what I do, and desire to continue following my dream to change the world.<p>I graduated high school when I was 16, so the next logical step for me was to apply to college. Not knowing very much about the education system in this country, I applied as a computer science major to Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, USC, Caltech, Amherst, Harvey Mudd, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. My grades and test scores were great, but not stellar by any definition. I mistakenly assumed institutions would be more impressed by my technical talent and drive to succeed than my raw academic performance. I was denied by all of the colleges I applied to except for RPI, which I will be attending this fall.<p>My worries were exacerbated after reading Philip Guo's 2009 article, ""The advantages of attending a prestigious name-brand university"" (http://www.pgbovine.net/advantages-of-name-brand-school.htm). This post broke my heart, because not only will job offers and VC funding be exponentially harder to accrue, my work will be disregarded in preference to ""better"" and ""smarter"" students at brand name universities. And with all of this coming from Mr. Guo (an MIT undergrad and Stanford doctoral student) I every reason to believe that he understands the situation in this field. I feel worthless, unsuccessful, and worst of all: misrepresented. I feel as if this disaster will follow me for the rest of my life.<p>So I ask you, fellow hackers, is there any hope for me? I've been getting more and more depressed by the day as I investigate my situation. Searching a brand name like ""MIT"" or ""Stanford"" on HN reveals hundreds of comments on hundreds of posts: ""MIT researchers the location of memories"", ""Stanford changes higher learning forever"". Searching ""RIP"" gives a few random posts about students leaving RPI or the Rasberry Pi computer.<p>Thank you so much for any input you can offer me, I truly respect all of your opinions and experience in this field.",1334512760

3844179,comment,3843745,3844147,2,0,fl3tch,,,"> Many VPN services claim that they do not maintain connection logs<p>If you're paying for the service, then you need to authenticate to it either with a password or certificate. Either way, the VPN provider knows when you're connected. Also, to prevent sharing of accounts, they will often limit the number of IP addresses you can connect from (within a certain period of time), which means that almost all of them log IP addresses and connection times.  That information, combined with other evidence, could be enough to connect you to certain activities.<p>For example, suppose you're harassing someone on a forum and they get the cops involved. They know the date and time of all of your posts, so they go to your VPN provider, and you're the only person who was connected every single time a post was made. Now, it's good to catch people like that, but if you require strong anonymity just use Tor.",1334512243

3844159,comment,3843139,3843852,2,0,dkrich,,,"But your wife is one use case. Think of the users of SMS or email or any asynchronous communications protocol as a Venn diagram. You have categories of people who need to communicate with each other that happen to both have iPhones. Others both have GChat. Others both have BBM. Still others happen to be online for real-time chat at the same time.<p>All of these users fall into one umbrella category, however: a group of at least two people, at least one of whom needs to say something to another person. If I need to say something now to a friend, I use SMS ten times out of ten. Why? Because I know, without a doubt, that if I send an SMS, it is going to be read by that person regardless of device, software, etc. A centralized protocol is required to tie together disparate software. The 140 byte limit is annoying. But what happens when technology catches up to human length requirements, and it is extended to 400 or 1000 characters? Then you are going to care about length limits even less.<p>The author's point is that email as a concept and prototype is not broken and is functioning exactly as it should be, which is why it is the preferred communication medium for most people despite decades of development in better chat/list/calendar clients. Knowing you can get a hold of somebody every time is a benefit that outweighs any other. Same reason Skype hasn't taken over cell/land line phones. Centralized protocols are a necessity. Do they come with limitations for some use cases? Of course. Nothing can be everything to everybody. Which is why the author's point is so well taken: that additional functionality catering to single use-cases belongs at the client level in the form of extensions.<p>Edit: Also, it seems strange to me that people argue that email is broken because their inboxes have turned into todo lists. I think the reverse is true and people are looking at it through the wrong end. Email is such a simple, useful tool, that people not only use it for its intended purpose (communication) they now also use it for managing todo lists. After all, there are boatloads of todo list software and more and more coming on the market everyday, and yet people still use email while they talk about how shitty a solution it is.",1334511615

3844081,comment,3840241,3840241,1,0,grannygoodness,,,"Ms. Jaeger:<p>It has come to my attention that Rachel Mendelson aka ""Rachel Marone"" aka ""Rachel Haywire"" aka ""Transhuman X""  may be allowed to use kickstarter again only 2 years after she took $3,000 with a fraudulent kickstarter effort.  People are angrily posting on this page even as of a few months ago, and she has no plans to print the CD or to make any of the charitable contribution percentage she promised from this project.  Please do not allow her to make any more kickstarter efforts, and defraud more people.  Here is the page and the comments from people who never got their CD from her.  By kickstarter's own rules, she should be required to return the donations at this point, not start a new fraudulent kickstarter campaign.  She is very likely to start a new kickstarter account called 'Rachel Marone', be aware she is abusing kickstarter for financially fraudulent purposes.<p>Here is the link to the project that never did anything but take money:<p><a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/machinekuntrecords/sanity-is-slavery"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/machinekuntrecords/sanit...</a><p>where you can see comments of complaint from its backers:<p>""If youre a backer of this project, please log in to read this post.

        It's a year after this posting, almost two years after this was funded, and I have yet to receive my hard copy of this album. Very displeased. :/

The 1 cent price doesn't take into account the $12.49 international shipping costs (as well as the up to six week wait for delivery) I have to deal with if I buy used books via Amazon. Also, I almost exclusively read foreign books and I love being able to tap a foreign word and immediately get the translation. That would be worth a lot to me even if ebooks weren't cheaper and delivered to me a million times faster.",1334509213

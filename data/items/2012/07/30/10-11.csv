4311768,comment,4311060,4311060,8,0,vorg,,,"A comparison between two languages only makes sense if the purpose of each language is the same, e.g. if the purpose of both Scala and Haskell is to enable programmers to build stuff easily, or if it was to build performant code, or whatever.<p>But if the purposes are different, then comparing Scala and Haskell is like apples and oranges. If Scala's purpose is, say, to introduce Java programmers to Haskell, then a comparison would even be part of the purpose of Scala. Moving Java programmers to Haskell could very well be Odersky's real motive behind building and marketing Scala. He could actually be a hero of the programming ecosystem instead of a former academic who started a company to milk a software product he got grad CS students to build for free. This talk about exploring functional/object fusion could be bogus, a cover story for showing programmers how easy typed functional can be, and prompting them to consider a full move to Haskell.<p>In fact, Clojure looks like a similar case of introducing something to Java programmers. What with Clojure for Javascript coming out, and now even a C-target version, Clojure's looking more and more like an underhanded way to move Java programmers to Lisp. Surely Hickey's finishing the job, started back in 1995 when Java ""moved C++ programmers half way to Lisp"".",1343645690

Pretty sure that is still the case.<p>hie actually parses the file (using a modified version of haskell-src-exts to support more extensions), and gives show-type-at-point, goto definition, and auto complete with inline haddock documentation. Its autocomplete is context sensitive--for instance, if you type ""import "" you will only see modules. It also works somewhat incrementally and on-the-fly. YMMV, and it isn't documented well, but I use it every day and haven't had any problems.<p>If you want to try it out, you'll probably need Emacs 24. It  might work on Emacs 23. Use hie-fetch.py to fetch the source for all of the packages you have installed, and ""hie-hackage.py cachedir"" to pre-cache your libs.

The situation is so bad that blackouts are a part and parcel of normal life in India. The situation does vary a lot over the country - some of the more fortunate parts enjoy an average of 23 hours of power a day. Some places have it really bad with ""cuts"" of 10 - 15 hrs a day not uncommon.<p>Power generation is not enough to satisfy the demand. This isn't because of the lack of power plants alone. The existing power plants are mismanaged and often produce less power than they are designed for because of faulty components. New power plants often get stuck with political problems.",1343642974

This is being worked on.<p>However, your statement about Ruby, Python, Perl and Node is BS. Especially Ruby is very hairy to get up and running unless you are happy with old versions from your distro. Setting up the Haskell platform is not a lot more difficult than tinkering with rvm and bundler and whatnot to get Ruby up and running. Python is a little better because most useful libs are included in the ""batteries"" that ship with the interpreter. But try to use a bunch of libs and you enter virtualenv hell.<p>And whenever a new major change comes out, a new world of hurt begins. Ruby 1.9, Python 3 and Perl 6 transitions have been really painful.<p>If these languages work better, it's only because your distro package maintainers spend more time working on it.",1343642854

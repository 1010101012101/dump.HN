7699280,comment,7697768,7699141,2,0,Jtsummers,,,"I don&#x27;t disagree with the order of teaching, in general, but with its pacing. Arithmetic shouldn&#x27;t be given 6 (K-5) years. Algebra shouldn&#x27;t be 3-4 years (6-8 or 6-9). We bore students with the same material slightly stepped up each year for years at a time until they get to high school. Then we try and hit the accelerator and make them jump from the most rudimentary concepts in arithmetic and algebra and get them through trigonemetry or calculus in 3 more years. The concepts of trig, calculus, probability and stats, linear algebra can all be taught earlier. Students are capable of this, but the curricula aren&#x27;t designed around it.<p>I didn&#x27;t even realize until college that Algebra II <i>was</i> linear algebra. The notations used in college linear algebra would&#x27;ve been difficult for me to grasp fully at the time, but they make solving those systems of equations so much easier. And learning the notation [in high school], getting to the courses in college they&#x27;d be far less intimidating. We have 13 years with students before college, plenty of time to introduce notation and higher order concepts slowly rather than dumping it on them freshman year of college.<p>EDIT: Clarification on time of something",1399305477

This subset tends to be the only mathematics that are taught in high school (or even in undergrad unless you&#x27;re a math major), which I think is a huge part of the problem. I can&#x27;t recall the last time I did a proof of something in abstract algebra, category theory, or algebraic topology that actually involved a calculation of any kind, so clearly a facility with basic calculations is unnecessary for those proofs.

7699232,comment,7697768,7698220,1,0,the_watcher,,,">> Much of our teaching processes focus on skills, rather than a more abstract notion of &quot;education.&quot; There&#x27;s been much said about why this is a bad thing; I&#x27;m rather ambivalent on it myself, seeing from casual observation how much benefit skill-focused education can offer to those who would otherwise simply learn nothing. Of course, this works better where self-motivated students are not stymied by too-strict adherence to curricula. IOW, perhaps we don&#x27;t teach math, but we do teach the skills that are required to &quot;experience&quot; math at a later date.<p>Skill based education is better than not learning anything.  No one argues this, it&#x27;s a strawman.  The point is, learning a method to do something without any kind of explanation or example of why you ever would do it is woefully suboptimal.  In an attempt to come up with the most absurd example of this - it can feel like learning to scuba dive in a world with no water deeper than 8 feet, especially given that most teachers I had actually could not give me examples of how to apply the &quot;math&quot; I was learning (and I was a very immature handful back then, very unshy about demanding an explanation of why I was wasting my time learning something that I couldn&#x27;t see a use for).  The author isn&#x27;t arguing for eliminating all the &quot;skills-based&quot; education he references, he&#x27;s arguing that we move it closer to how music is taught - teach all the skills, but then immediately apply them to something the students can relate to, at that age (not in 7 years when they are working and run the risk of being like me, and not recognizing the importance of these concepts until then).  Math is everywhere.  Most people learn basic computation fairly easily, since it can be taught in the context of going to the grocery store or splitting a check.  Get beyond this, and all of a sudden, schools quit even attempting to anchor math education in reality (by this I mean a situation that could conceivably occur in reality, not simply taking a number problem and putting words to it).<p>The argument in favor of mandatory musical education would actually probably benefit from stealing a bit of this piece: music is one of the best forms of education in terms of immediate application of the concepts and methods you are taught, perhaps only behind physical education.",1399305082

Something like it is probably inevitable.<p>Everywhere you go, you see people walking around with Apple headphones in their ears much of the time. The hardware connected to those headphones doesn&#x27;t merely send music out to the ears from the phone, it also accepts signals in the other direction to enable microphone input and a few buttons for pause/play and volume up/down. So sending other sorts of signals back doesn&#x27;t require any new hardware on the phone.<p>There currently exist devices that take body temperature by sticking a sensor in the ear. Apple has a history of sticking all sorts of tiny sensors in their phones to enable new software features. So why not an earbud thermometer?<p>If they stuck a temperature sensor in the headphone it would enable these features:<p>(1) an plain old on-demand thermometer app. Think you might have a fever? There&#x27;s an app for that! Wonder what temperature it is outside? Same app! A temperature sensor inside the phone mostly tells you how hot the battery and processor are but a temperature sensor in the earbud tells you your own temperature (when you&#x27;re wearing them) or the ambient local temperature (when you take them out). Both are useful information.<p>(2) A background thermometer-based health check. Listen to music on headphones and the iPhone can warn you if you have a fever or are overheating during a workout.<p>Even without more speculative features - blood sugar or blood pressure testing - this is <i>doable</i>.

It&#x27;s a common, and valid complaint about American education - we are very good at stripping out all practical applications of a subject and simply teaching a method for solving a problem that is completely unrelated to anything in reality.  In one of Richard Feynman&#x27;s books, he writes about his experience editing textbooks.  He notices this, and in his typically fantastic way, rips the textbooks to shreds.  One of his examples went something like this:<p>Some problem, while accurate in that the process to get to the answer worked, was a word problem.  Part of this problem read &quot;The Earth has two suns. One is blue, the other is green.&quot;  He stops this early in the problem, since even here, they have made the problem about something that is completely unrelated to reality.  Think back to high school - you have not lived long enough (in most cases) to be able to mentally reapply a process to a problem you have had in your own life, so education should be going far out of its way to present problems in a way that the kids encountering them can understand.  The Wire had a great example - using gambling to teach probability (there&#x27;s a moral argument there that I won&#x27;t touch - the point is the kids could understand why they were learning math, since it solved a problem or gave them an advantage that they could immediately relate to).  Programming could help with this (I haven&#x27;t taken a math class since my senior year of high school, and always did well in all of them, but I feel like I understand why I would use algebra better now than ever, since I can actually relate to the concept of variables in reality, rather than &quot;make the numbers into letters&quot;).  Baseball has taught me more about statistics and data analysis than any class I ever took.<p>I remember learning about finding the slope of an equation in 7th grade.  I had a huge argument with my teacher (I was a bit of a handful back then), because she actually could not give me a single example of why I would ever need to care about the slope of a line beyond future math classes.  That&#x27;s a problem.<p>TL;DR - The author is likely more frustrated with American education&#x27;s tendency to remove all relatability from a subject (and then not arming teacher&#x27;s with good examples of how to reapply the methods they learned to a problem that encourages more investigation) than he is strictly accurate about students not actually doing math.  And I agree.",1399304439

Then you abstract addition with multiplication, and then abstract that with division. Once you&#x27;ve done that, you abstract all of arithmetic with algebra.<p>And, well, it goes from there. You need some abstraction of algebra to do trig, calculus, and geometry. And to be able to abstract it, you need to understand it.

To the point that some friends and I seriously considered &quot;portable lines&quot; as a business.[1]<p>The general rational I was able to determine was this:<p>1. Customers don&#x27;t want to go to a boring place - this means they want to go where there are people.<p>2. Customers have a &quot;fear of missing out&quot; that can be exploited - the line must mean this is the place to be!<p>3. People don&#x27;t translate high price to &quot;popular place&quot; - they translate &quot;lots of people&quot; to &quot;popular place&quot;, higher prices translates to &quot;over priced, not as good as they are charging&quot; in the long run particularly.<p>4. A consistently popular place attracts people in a different way than an expensive place... people are bad at putting a price on time - so waiting a bit is &quot;worth it&quot; but paying a bit more isn&#x27;t, at least multiple times - extra cost translates to special occasion, but extra line means &quot;good time, just plan a for a bit of a wait&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve watched places try higher pricing, and worked at places that upped prices, and it seemed to not work so well, they generally went back to cheaper pricing and made up for it in volume -- even say $.25 price increases had a serious negative effect!<p>All of this is in context of popular bar spots where the competition was literally next door. The place with the line always won that night, despite prices being the same, including amongst regulars or frequent customers choosing the place with the line, even if they preferred a different place.<p>There were of course always those people who would choose the anti-line strategy, but profits and sales were low compared to the nights you could get an early line going.<p>Final observation: there was one place that I&#x27;d see people driving or walking past waiting for there to be a line before they showed up. There was no talking them into &quot;come in now before the line, because it will happen and you won&#x27;t have to wait!&quot;.<p>[1] The model would be this: hire &quot;portable line inc&quot; to popularize your evening&#x27;s event. They get a bunch of people to stand in a line out front of your establishment - say 50 or so. Each of the people has to go through the line a couple of times, and in exchange they get a voucher for a free drink or two. The liners also hang out and socialize for say 10 minutes before the second time through the line. If you time it right (which is generally predictable), they will be a good draw and other folks will generally get worked in as well. (there are some algorithmic efficiencies to work out too), but they will provide the &quot;this is happening!&quot; atmosphere before actual customers get inolved in appropriate numbers to be a self-perpetuating line.",1399303855

Once you reached the point of running a shell, GNU userland, an editor, and a compiler, it was off to the races.  Not sufficient, but necessary.<p>• No lawsuit.  The UNIX Wars put a multi-year crimp on FreeBSD.  The BSD splits didn&#x27;t help much either (these included not just the userland as in Linux distros, but kernel development --which for Linux distros remains unified).<p>• Freely hackable, <i>but</i> published changes are licensed under GPL.  I don&#x27;t know how much thought went into Linus&#x27;s choice of license, but it proved highly fortuitous.<p>• The time was absolutely ripe.  Even within proprietary Unix companies, people were advocating heavily for a freely-available, open-source operating system.  See Larry McVoy&#x27;s &quot;The Sourceware Operating System Proposal&quot;, from his days as a SunOS engineer prior to founding BitMover: <a href=""http://www.landley.net/history/mirror/unix/srcos.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.landley.net/history/mirror/unix/srcos.html</a><p>• Key early adopters and developers.  Alan Cox on development, and John &quot;Maddog&quot; Hall at DEC were key in both pushing kernel development, facilitating early ports (to Alpha), and in putting legitimacy behind the effort.<p>• Multiple distros.  Almost immediately a side-light of bundling up the kernel and a set of utilities into a usable package emerged:  Boot Root, MCC, TAMU, SLS, Yggdrasil.  I remember SLS (&quot;soft landing systems&quot;) being explained, somewhat fondly, as &quot;because it was a pile of shit&quot;.  Eventually over a few months in 1994 Slackware, Red Hat, Debian, SuSE, and Caldera emerged, which with very few notable exceptions continue to rule the distro landscape.  I find interesting that &quot;bootable distros&quot; were present from very nearly the start (my own first exposure to these was Linux Root Boot, a/k/a Lnxrtbt, on a single floppy, also Trinux, booting from 2+ disks into a ramdisk).  LWN has a good early history:  <a href=""https://lwn.net/Articles/91371/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lwn.net/Articles/91371/</a><p>• As others have noted, functionality, cost, features, and exigency all meant that technical needs felt at the coalface by front-line engineering staff at many firms were being met with decommissioned server, or, very often, desktop systems.  While Microsoft-bound CIOs were proclaiming &quot;we run no Linux and never will&quot; their organizations were in fact increasingly not only using, but dependent on it.  These denials persisted through the early 2000s, though beyond 1998 or so it was largely only dead-enders maintaining this.<p>And from there it just continued to build.  I&#x27;d argue that the linchpin argument wasn&#x27;t money made selling Linux or Linux services, but companies based on it which simply couldn&#x27;t exist by other means, of which the most notable early exemplar was almost certainly Google.

I worked at a company in that spot for a while.  In SaaS, sales teams can play a big role, but until you have a pretty decent cashflow, it makes more sense to me to have them focus much more on inbound sales (and account management) than outbound, which is a very different sales model.

So reads/verifies are fast, but inserts/updates/deletes are slow. Also, the mining parameters can be tuned to make it easier/faster to do an insert, at a tradeoff of a larger blockchain history for initial clients to process and more orphans (See litecoin, which has a 2.5min block processing target).

They solve it by review hierarchy. One person has the responsibility to pull code or not and he in turn asks for a pull request from the maintainer one step higher when he has gathered enough new material. This doesn&#x27;t just ensure fast development but also ensures that each commit is reviewed a few times before it gets into the main branch.<p>To answer the question about the >100 emails: Yes. From nearly everywhere I can I pull each and every email and then filter via filter rules and google&#x27;s priority inbox (which you can mimic with open source tools as far as I&#x27;ve read). I seriously have only one or two emails more to handle than I want to in a span of three months. Sometimes I want an email with a specific topic, sometimes nearly everything a specific person writes or says, and it all gets piped and filtered quite well.<p>That&#x27;s the awesomeness of pure text. There are not many limits to what you can achieve by having simple and well understood text formats. On the other hand the messaging in these programs is limited to what the program was meant to do.

But emails where not meant to be sent and received in today&#x27;s huge amounts, yet it&#x27;s not a problem that can&#x27;t be solved.

7698903,comment,7694795,7697729,1,0,cjblomqvist,,,"With the risk of picking on details (sorry if it sounds that way!): From what my understanding (and also what I&#x27;ve heard is the story from Chinese people and gov) is that the situation of China regarding demographics is the way it is because Mao promoted population growth without end, mainly because a larger workforce would be able to outperform in output (which we&#x27;ve actually seen now is true). The downside with that policy was that there were no thought taken to when it would end, and the government/leaders that came after saw that a growing population would be impossible to feed (it was a big problem already for Mao) and it would eventually cause a sort of population bubble. Thus, they enforced the one-child policy to stop this. The current Chinese government seems to be quite aware of the demographics problems. According to official statistics (based on from what I&#x27;ve heard from a Chinese person), they estimate China will grow from the current 1.3 billion population up to 1.6 before it stagnates and possibly decreases. Considering the problems of a decreasing population and skewed demographics, they have started to loosen up the one-child policy however so there seems to be thinking within the top of China that they need to make a slow transition back to a more healthy size of the population.<p>By the way, this seems also to be the case in general with the top leaders in China. As been previously stated, China is probably way behind on the prerequisites to be able to run a working democracy (compare for example many of the countries where democracy have been quickly forced upon a country such as many of the countries where the US have been engaged in various conflicts such as Iraq and Afghanistan as well as countries in Central America). The positive sign from the leaders in China is their current and (as it looks anyway) real fight against corruption, which is a huge problem in any democracy (it seems anyhow). Of course, education is another problem but it seems like maybe there&#x27;s not so much that can be done right now that let it take the time it takes to develop (since old people in general are not targeted for the educational system).<p>This, in combo with my comment where I mention Hans Rosling&#x27;s interesting statistics, makes me quite positive about the future of China. Hopefully it lands rather than crashes and perhaps it is healthier to the country to avoid a crash and slowly manage the much needed creative destruction rather than face the consequences of a crash. A crash may for example cause a lot of social unrest, which probably will become a larger problem for China as their growth slows. Hopefully, they&#x27;ll plateau into a healthy developed country, similar to what (in my opinion) it seems like Japan did. Although we don&#x27;t here much about it, China is a much bigger countries with many more different groups of people than Japan (as far as my knowledge goes anyhow) and I think social unrest has much bigger potential as a serious issue to China&#x27;s well-being (and thus probably the world&#x27;s well-being since we do so much trading with China).<p>China has a long way to go and lots of problems such as corruption, educational level of the average man, transparency, human rights, and so forth.

The fact is when you want to create a meaningful animation between one state and another, you need to be aware and in control (as a developer) of what exactly the change is. Diffing may produce one <i>possible</i> valid state change delta for the developer to work with, but no guarantee it&#x27;ll be the correct one. So what does that mean for animated transitions? Is immediate mode dooming them to either not be used, or to be semi-arbitrary depending on what the diff engine decides?<p>2. Fact is that the browser usually has no access to the full server-backed state of the widget that it&#x27;s rendering. Instead, the communication with the backend that powers said widget (say a chat box) is in the form of delta state changes. You don&#x27;t get the full chat log from the server every time someone sends you a chat message, you get the change only: new message from x.<p>So if we need to be &quot;state aware&quot; and communicate with &quot;state change events&quot; so to speak with the server anyway, why suddenly drop that knowledge and pretend all the state is local by emulating immediate mode rendering?<p>It doesn&#x27;t feel like less work. It feels like more work, and less possibilities (said animations in point 1).",1399302021

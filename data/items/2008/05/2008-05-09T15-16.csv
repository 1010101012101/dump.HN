The author is claiming that webmasters have to build two sites rather than one, thinning resources and reducing quality.  This is because if Google determines one is spam, they have to fall back to the other site.<p>But if the sites are similar and are created for safe redundancy, I would assume the second site is going to imminently get nailed as well.  I mean, the guys says build two of the same sites at different places so you have a backup.  You're building two mediocre targets either hoping that the other one isn't noticed by google (which probably means users aren't finding it either) or that they're significantly different somehow.<p>I agree, it sounds in its lack of detail like someone doing something sketchy and complaining it doesn't work.

So if I am the first one to upvote something, and the post ends up with 20 karma points, I get a f(20) or f(19) karma, depending whether I want to include myself.<p>- Give people a daily karma limit which is based on their current karma score<p>- Back in my early school days when I used Word I used to like having my papers rated on the ""Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level"" and was always trying to get the perfect score of 12. Maybe something like that could be included but that may be overkill - probably let it be entirely user driven.<p>- The ultimate purpose is to keep everything balanced and make the new users feel involved without being limited too much, so a lot of these ideas may need to be tested.",1210347217

I want to know exactly what we're talking about. Otherwise I tend to surmise, perhaps unfairly, that articles like this are astroturf: They're written by spammers or spammer apologists who are angry that their highly profitable link farms have been effectively cut  off. After all, if I find myself reading a random article on this topic, it's probably because a) it's ubiquitous or b) my subconscious has been lured to it by a well-crafted linkbaity headline. And who is good at making posts ubiquitous and tempting? Spammers!<p>So knock it off with abstractions like ""sheep"" and show me some real examples, so I can empathize properly.<p>Second, the reason why Google doesn't take a ""rule of law"" approach is easy to see, isn't it? Nobody on earth is better at gaming complex sets of rules than programmers. Create a clear specification that defines ""spam"" and the spammers will promptly craft a ton of elegant and technically legal ads and then flood Google with them.<p>Why doesn't this happen with the ""rule of law"" in a legal setting? Well, it does: People play fast and loose with laws all the time. But the real secret to the rule of law is that the ultimate arbiter of that law is... groups of actual humans called ""juries"" and ""courts"", who are empowered to use common sense to throw the book at those who get too creative with the edge cases. Real-world law has intentionally fuzzy edges. (Of course, when the fuzz spreads into the center, you've got a problem.)<p>Proposing to turn Google's ranking system into something resembling a legal system -- which is perhaps equivalent to taking our existing legal system and applying more of it to Google, i.e. legislating certain elements of Google's design -- is an interesting idea, and it may eventually be tried, but it's not obvious that it will improve anything, or even change anything. And it's going to be hard to discuss how well it might work unless we use... real examples!",1210345211

These people are already being aggressively retained with bonuses and the like.<p>If you're an ""out"", well, by definition Yahoo won't be that interested.<p>And the ""ups"" that ""became outs"", so to speak, are people who are of such strong personal conviction that they turned down gobs of money in 2007 from Google to, say, take a riskier position at Facebook or do their own thing. In those cases, it's unlike more gobs of money from Yahoo in 2012 will convince them to jump ship, unless Marissa can offer things to recruits that she couldn't offer to recruits at Google.

You haven't really offered any reason that should exist (information can't be seized, by the way, because the original owner still has it).<p>""I believe I have carefully evaluated whether my reaction is emotional. Frankly, I'm a bit offended...""<p>I got you confused with the person to whom I originally replied, who said: ""I certainly would be glad to know that none are in my (crime-free) neighborhood."" That's clearly an emotional reaction, but I apologize for attributing it to you.<p>The only rationale I can imagine for restricting gun rights is to preserve some proportion of lives (or maybe an absolute quantity). I would still like to see your argument framed that way. It's unreasonable for me to ask for a specific number, but it seems like you should have some order-of-magnitude percentage in mind -- e.g. A% of the population were violently killed last year; restricting gun rights will reduce that to B% in Y years, thereby saving (A-B)% of the population per year.<p>The problem that this line of argument faces, of course, is that the percentage of people killed by guns is already quite low. And more than half of those are suicides, which probably wouldn't be prevented by gun restrictions. Some other fraction would still be killed by other means. And, unless Y is a very large number, then you still may have many gun deaths simply because there are still so many guns around.<p>When you actually work out the numbers will all of these things accounted for in a realistic way, I suspect that (A-B)% will be a small number (or negative), and Y will be a large number. In other words, a small (or negative) benefit after a lot of waiting (and possibly bad consequences during that transition).<p>But it would still be perfectly rational for you to say that you believe it will save a single life, and that's enough of a benefit for you. You'd probably want to take some risk into account though, in case you're wrong and the life isn't actually saved.<p>""I think I'm turning the burden of proof around simply because the reasons against gun rights seem fairly obvious to me. Guns are tools built to kill, with no other use. They have very little in the way of useful legitimate uses.""<p>You assume that the guns must be <i>used</i> to be <i>useful</i>, which is false. In fact, the presence of guns may <i>reduce</i> the frequency with which they are used[1]. Even police in a lot of areas have probably never fired their weapons at another human.<p>[1] I have no numbers to back this up, but again, my argument does not depend on numbers.",1343066291

Maintenance of hundreds or thousands of miles of cable is also very expensive.  <i>Upgrading</i> all of that cable infrastructure is even more expensive.<p>><i>So, there's no reason to spend the money to have enough technicians to ensure they are able to do a good job and a timely one.</i><p>More money spent on technicians = more money paid by consumers.  Yet you complain about higher fees.  At some point, you must recognize that there is <i>cost</i> to pay for all of the services you demand.  Technicians do not work for free.<p>><i>But you don't hear this issue at election time. Why do people not hold their city council peeps accountable for imposing this overpriced monopoly on them?
My guess is that most don't realize it is a government created monopoly, and the ones who do, many think that there would be no cable if the city hadn't given those rights away as an incentive to install all the cable. (not the case... places where this doesn't happen, still get cable because it isn't that expensive to put in the cable.)
</i><p>Simple solution: don't subscribe to cable.  Cable is not a right.  <i>It's a choice that is not forced upon you.</i>  Alternatively, subscribe to satellite, use the free OTA signals, or learn to live without live TV.",1343065621

What's a typical web app? Most of those that I've built had in some way or another email connectivity. Many had a newsletter component somewhere that was used to inform users about new features/offers/whatever promotional content. Even more had the tentative idea of at least keeping the option open. And if you do that, you need to confirm the email address. So probably we differ on the notion of ""typical"" here and I guess that's a point that can't be resolved.<p>> You are still arguing a false dichotomy of ""double opt in"" vs ""not double opt in"". Double opt is entirely irrelevant. The only time I mentioned it was pointing out that it is not in any way a legal requirement.<p>Sorry, you kinda lost me here. I don't understand what point you're trying to make.<p>> People said it is a huge usability flaw.<p>That's the whole point. IMHO it isn't that ""huge"" when you have double opt-in anyways. And as I pointed out that there are some reasons to have double opt-in regardless of legal requirements as well, in fact, most services that I signed up for use it. That might be different for you, but it's certainly not a minority or a freak occurrence if you encounter some service that uses double opt-in. So it can't be that bad either.<p>I fully acknowledge that you have a different view here, that's completely fine with me.",1343064733

Living in Oslo, I know people who work in the government buildings that were hit, people who earlier years have been to the AUF camp at Utya, and I've also personally been to Utya at a Maths camp. My girlfriend were a only few blocks from the bomb when it went off.<p>The next six months, I'll be working in R6, one of the buildings in the executive government quarter where the bomb went off, but only suffered minor damages. I'll be walking past the bomb site. In fact, I was there earlier in the summer. Here's a photo I took: <a href=""http://instagram.com/p/MK9aWrtM3z/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://instagram.com/p/MK9aWrtM3z/</a><p>Norwegians are generally peaceful. We have a low crime rate and high employment rate. We do rank 11th on number of guns per capita by country[1], though, but the few people I know who have guns are active hunters. Norway usually tops the UNs list of best places to live. Norway has its share of problems, of course, but it usually pales in comparison to problems other places.<p>The 2011 attacks were just unbelievable, and I try not to think about them in detail because it's too emotional. Before the attacks, Norway was so very, very innocent and unspoiled. We've managed to retain some of our innocence, perhaps, and even one year after the attack, I feel that we're still trying to find out how to handle it.<p>I'm not entirely sure what my intention was with this post, but now that I've written it, I might as well post it. If you've read this far, I hope you got something out of it - perhaps new insight into the Norwegian psyche, if anything.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_guns_per_capita_by_co...</a>",1343064573

If you're on a business trip your business probably has a deal in place with one of the big companies, and you probably want to just have a car for the whole trip and not worry about it - especially since you're going to be expensing it anyway, and neither you or the expenses department wants the trouble of figuring out exactly how many hours of car rental is reasonable. Zipcar's great advantage is for unplanned, one-or-two-hour rentals (often because you need to transport something bulky, which a business would have specialist ways of doing), which is far more common for private individuals than businesspeople.",1343063085

4431161,comment,4424081,4430850,1,0,thuffy,,,"It is actually quite wise to consider DNA like any other programming language. It is a much more complicated language, being a spatial programming language, but it is a programming language none the less. Such a perspective provides great insight.<p>Anyways, you are correct that we are not there yet with actually fixing the bugs in code. We are not even remotely close to that point unfortunately.<p>The ideas of not subsidizing excessive defectiveness are a far cry from anything to do with genetic purity. It seems that you are in clear bias with a motive to shut down any discussion on the topic by poisoning the well of these truths by injecting labels such as 'genetic purity' and 'eugenics'. Any enlightened reader can see that your only arguments are appeals to emotion and guilt by association. A fallacious association as I have proved.<p>My original argument is simply that subsidizing excessive defectiveness is increasing the amount of suffering in the world, not helping to reduce it as one might intuitively believe. You are correct however that it also causes an excessive burden. An ever increasing burden. Medicare costs are spiraling out of control in all nations with socialized medicine, that includes America (Medicare and Medicaid, de facto free emergency care, and so on). In fact, the American federal budget allocates more to socialized medicine than to the military. A military known for its expansive cost. It will only become worse with the new full blown explicit socialized medicare system recently affirmed by the supreme court. This dysgenic path humanity is taking is the primary reason for the ever increasing medicare costs of countries with socialist medicare. This is off-topic from my original point, however, I share it with you as you asked and said you were very interested.<p>Your next paragraph is flawed in saying that somehow being anti-dysgenic is being dysgenic. I am advocating the lack of action. You are saying that requires selection? There is no selection I am calling for. I am advocating to let nature do the selection. I am calling for less artificial intervention. Not more.<p>Your next point is also defective in saying that someone who has a defect is not defective. I refer you to my programming analogy from my previous comment. A system with such grave defects that it cannot operate without expensive workarounds is certainly worthy of being called defective.<p>To your conclusion: you may feel such emotions regarding the harsh realities of the problem at hand, but emotions are not logic, and do not a reasoned opinion make.",1345870271

4431159,comment,4430101,4430535,3,0,dkrich,,,"Interesting, because I see this from exactly the opposite side. Apple hardly needs a billion dollars, but I don't think this does anything to strengthen their image or their power in the marketplace, but I do believe it emboldens people who already dislike Apple, and begins to alert people who do that Apple doesn't put innovation and consumers first. That is to say they are no longer viewed as a company that out-innovates everyone else, but rather one that wants to hoard the mobile market. I think consumers are pretty sharp and realize this. I love Apple products, but I sure as hell don't want them limiting my choice when I go to buy a new phone.<p>Lest we forget that Microsoft was getting sued under the antitrust act just fifteen or so years ago. At that time, Apple was a joke and people who used MS software regularly began to resent them. How silly that seems now that they are relegated to owning only the shitty, bloatware enterprise productivity market.",1345870218

4431140,comment,4429234,4429234,13,0,gus_massa,,,"I read the original article that is much clearer about the details ( <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4429424"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4429424</a> ).<p>My explanation of the effect is long a bit technical. I hope that it is intelligible.<p>(To keep this simple, I will ignore the phases of the waves.)<p>* * * Complex notation:<p>First, the equation for the electric field of the light is<p><pre><code>  E = A cos(kz-wt)\n</code></pre>\nIt's more convenient to write it as a sum of complex exponentials<p><pre><code>  E = A [exp(i(kz-wt)) + exp(i(-kz-(-w)t))] /2\n  E = Re( A [exp(i(kz-wt))])\n</code></pre>\nBy the linearity of the equations, the exp(i(kz-wt)) part and the exp(i(-kz-(-w)t)) have the same behavior, so you usually write simply<p><pre><code>  ""E"" = A exp(i(kz-wt))\n</code></pre>\nand solve everything as if it where a complex function, but just before writing the final version or going to the laboratory you must remember that the other part was there, and that the real physical object is the real part of the function.<p>* * * Standard non linearity effects:<p>If the media is linear but not uniform, there appear other waves that travel in other direction z' (reflection/refractions). All of them have the same w.<p><pre><code>  ""E_tot"" = A exp(i(kz-wt)) + A' exp(i(kz'-wt)) \n</code></pre>\nReally all of them have two parts, one with w and the other with -w,<p><pre><code>  E_tot = A/2 [exp(i(kz-wt))+ exp(i(-kz-(-w)t))] + A'/2 [exp(i(k'z-wt))+ exp(i(-kz-(-w)t))]\n</code></pre>\nbut usually you simply ignore that details, and only put a +cc (complex conjugate) or Re at the last minute.<p>If the media is no linear there can appear waves with a different frequency w'.<p><pre><code>  ""E_tot"" = A exp(i(kz-wt)) + A' exp(i(k'z-w't)) \n</code></pre>\n(There can appear more than two exponentials.)<p>Again they have two parts, and the real thing is the real part. It's more clear to choose w' as a positive number, because (-w') will appear in the hidden part of the equation.<p><pre><code>  E_tot = Re(""E_tot"")\n</code></pre>\n* * * New non linearity effects in this article:<p>In this article they use a very sharp pulse in a very non linear material. So, from the<p><pre><code>  ""E"" = A exp(i(kz-wt)) \n</code></pre>\npart they get two new exponentials<p><pre><code>  ""E_tot"" = A exp(i(kz-wt)) + A' exp(i(k'z-w't)) + A'' exp(i(k_n''z-w_n''t))\n</code></pre>\nwhere k' and w' are positive numbers as expected. But k_n'' and w_n'' are negative numbers!! They get this numbers from the same equation that has k' and w' as a solution, so all of them appear from the same mathematical term. They call this negative solution ""NRR"".<p>But it is important to remember that the original E has two exponentials, so you must repeat all the computations with the other part<p><pre><code>  ""E*"" = A exp(i(-kz-(-w)t))\n</code></pre>\neverything is equivalent, so after some recalculations you get<p><pre><code>  ""E*_tot"" = A exp(i(-kz-(-w)t)) + A' exp(i(-k'z-(-w')t)) + A'' exp(i(-k_n''z-(-w_n'')t))\n</code></pre>\nwhere every k and every w has an additional ""-"". They call this part ""NRR* "". But now -k_n'' and -w_n'' are positive numbers. We can change the names, and call<p><pre><code>  k'' = - k_n''\n  w'' = - w_n''\n</code></pre>\nand now k'' and w'' are positive numbers. So the first part of the solution is now<p><pre><code>  ""E_tot"" = A exp(i(kz-wt)) + A' exp(i(k'z-w't)) + A'' exp(i(-k''z-(-w'')t))\n</code></pre>\nand the second part is<p><pre><code>  ""E*_tot"" = A exp(i(-kz-(-w)t)) + A' exp(i(-k'z-(-w')t)) + A'' exp(i(k''z-w''t))\n</code></pre>\nAnd the real physical object is<p><pre><code>  E_tot = (""E_tot""+""E*_tot"")/2\n</code></pre>\nSo we can regroup the term. We exchange the terms with k'' and w'' that have the wrong signs from on part to the other, because the sum doesn't change.<p><pre><code>  ""E_totx"" = A exp(i(kz-wt)) + A' exp(i(k'z-w't)) + A'' exp(i(k''z-w''t))\n</code></pre>\nand the second part is<p><pre><code>  ""E*_totx"" = A exp(i(-kz-(-w)t)) + A' exp(i(-k'z-(-w')t)) + A'' exp(i(-k''z-(-w'')t))\n</code></pre>\nand as before<p><pre><code>  E_tot = (""E_totx""+""E*_totx"")/2\n</code></pre>\nNow the interpretation of ""E_totx"" is straightforward. From the original field ""E"" you get three waves, with frequencies w, w' and w'', all of them positive. And in ""E* _totx"" is the complex conjugate part, so the final result is real.<p>And they can measure the three waves.<p>* * * Notes:<p>Usually, the A'' coefficient is so small that all this strange part can be ignored, but they were able to measure it in the laboratory.<p>One important detail is that k/w, k'/w' and k_n''/w_n''= k''/w'' are all positive, so they represent waves that travel in the same direction.",1345869552

So the ""founder"" only had to bring the idea - and the rest would be done. At the back end, the VC would get their share as all do and the company and founder would be on their way.<p>I have mixed feelings about this approach. On the one hand I think it would be very valuable to have a place where people with legitimately good solid ideas, but no experience could go and have them turn into something real. On the other hand ideas are dime a dozen and really mean nothing without execution - and it's in getting to execution that the product is actually worth anything. Learning all of that ""stuff"" is the core of what being an entrepreneur is about. Short circuiting that is a recipe for disaster in the long term where you have tons of one hit wonders - that barely get out of beta, or V1 and don't know how to use what they have built to build other things.<p>I think there is value in re-inventing the wheel in most cases because you'll notice, when you have to do that, it's the real smart folks who recognize how the wheel is broken along the way and seek to improve that while developing their original product.

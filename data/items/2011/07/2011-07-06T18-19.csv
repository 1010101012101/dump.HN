They want the .Net platform to be pushed as far out as possible and Mono is a great way to do that.<p>No, Microsoft wants to make money off of its main products - Windows, Office, Server, etc. .NET is only a means to that goal.<p>Microsoft has an even better way to push .NET to other platforms - port .NET, the official runtime, to other platforms. This would be easy, and would actually ensure similar behavior on all platforms (unlike the current situation). However, this would eat into revenue from Microsoft's server OS and stack. So it will not happen.<p>Of course there are other factors here, and Microsoft did compromise by striking a patent deal with Novell, officially sanctioning Mono. But the other elements in that deal (Linux, office software, etc.) were very important too; it isn't  clear if Microsoft would have made that deal just for .NET alone.<p>Bottom line, Microsoft has basically nothing to gain, and something to lose, for helping Mono. Mono is already where Microsoft wants - allow some level of .NET outside of the Microsoft ecosystem, but with various performance and other limitations that make it a good idea for people invested in .NET code to purchase Microsoft's other software to run it on. Mono has been weakened, but not killed, by the layoff from Novell, which has worked in Microsoft's favor.<p>Microsoft is not stupid.

I thought This Is It (TM).<p>The monetary system, as it exists today is based on debt as a lever for growth. Banks can get a deposit of 1$ and God/King/Char/President/Whatever gave them the right to lend 5$ with it, and hold the 5th person under obligation of debt, to pay back that one dollar which the bank that gave it to him DIDN'T HAVE in the first place. You have to give back that 1 dollar or you will lose what you bought with it.
Proponents of this practice call it ""value"" of potential, they argue that banks can do this because if they lend 5$ for every 1$ they have, people who borrow these 5$ will really work their asses off and pay 5$ back, which means that banks valuate the ""potential"" of the market to create 5$ out of 1$. Then come investors, speculating the value of this ""potential"", buying the debt and selling it again for 12$ this time etc.<p>I thought that bitcoin was a chance to fight back the economy of debt. Every coin is 1BTC, no bank would be able to get it and magically transform it to 5BTCs any more. Potential would once again be expressed as ability to produce more or better of your products made for the same cost and EXCHANGE them for more or better products made by someone else, REAL things as assets against REAL things as liabilities exchanged through a non manipulatable medium.<p>Then, I woke up :) Bitcoin adopters and proponents are so unbelievably vested in the current status quo that they managed to create a caricature of the same, old monetary system replicated in the bitcoin world: exchanges that don't exchange bitcoins but integers, speculators, market crashes... like Wall Street No.2... and naturally ""It is not profitable any more, sell""...",1309976560

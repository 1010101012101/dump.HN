3234931,story,,,1,0,karanch,"Siri - The battle of the APIs ",,"Coming soon to an iPhone near you<p>That sweet hypnotic robotic voice that you hear from an iPhone 4S nowadays might not sound that sweet to some people after all. For beginners, definitely not to Google. No, its not the Android factor, in fact what seems to be worrying the search giant is the ad-stripped search results that Siri is dishing out to its users.<p>What might seem like a cool gadgetry app or just a fun activity today  that is, talking to your phone or making it answer your silly questions, is potentially as destructive for its competition as its innovative for the consumers. Siri in more ways than one has the potential to redefine the way we perceive and interact with a plethora of services that are available online. And in doing so, its paving the way for people to make these services a part of their everyday life closer than ever before.<p>The web has already become a cohesive unit of services with every application trying to find their niche market.  You have Netflix for movies, Facebook for social connect,  Spotify to listen to your music, Yelp to find your local grub and so on. Siri currently uses close to 35 APIs for retrieving information which covers most of the basic services that should  satisfy most of the users needs. But this number is surely going to increase and as the app space becomes more cramped, and its those that find a niche, will be the ones who will survive.<p>That begs a very important question? What APIs are going to be used by Siri in the future.<p>For example, Bing would surely feel short changed, as Siri uses google as the default search engine. Not that you cant change this in iphone settings, the question is how many users will do it? The same goes with yelp vs open table or a rotten tomato vs metacritic and the list goes on.<p>The interesting thing to watch would be if Siri will ever release its own API or just continue to partner with a host of services as they continue to move ahead.  Also, until now we have seen Siri as an interface to collect data from a source, will she ever be used to push data to a service?<p>I am sure a lot of developers are waiting with bated breath for the day Siri releases its API. For the possibility of integrating with this AI machine only means getting more people and traffic towards your service.  Google surely is not going to wait and watch.  Iris, the rumored Siri alternative for android is on its way and will surely try and match Siri blow by blow.<p>Looking at the history of the two companies, Google has always been perceived as the developer friendly one, and the assumption its Siris alternative will have its API released should not be a long shot. On the other hand, Apple has always played daddy to with its rules and restrictions. What say Flash? Will it change its game this time, considering it already has an edge with the hype it has generated with Siri.<p>Finally, I guess if you are an app developer or a web service provider, the most important question posing you tomorrow would be  Are you on Siri, yet? Cause maybe you might just not want to miss this boat.<p>Deepak Venugopal and Karan Chaudhry",1321293536
3234930,comment,3233526,3234360,2,0,Lagged2Death,,,"<i>You can certainly decide what's exceptional.</i><p>I can decide to make something in my code exceptional, sure. I can't decide to make something in the library not-exceptional, though.<p><i>You can put try-catch everywhere or nowhere (or choose a reasonable place in between).</i><p>This isn't always the case. Sometimes the only way to answer a question (""Can this string be parsed as an integer?"") is to try it and catch the exception. And there's just no way to do that coherently without catching it immediately.<p>Later releases of .NET do include a non-exception-throwing TryParse() call in many places. I'm pretty sure I've run into some cases where that was not available, however, and I'm pretty sure I've run into similar situations in other methods besides Parse(). And TryParse() was a late addition; look back in the 1.1 or 2.0 docs, and it doesn't exist.<p>In other words, somebody thought it was reasonable to force .NET users to catch some exceptions immediately.<p><i>Your hands are not tied by .net exceptions...</i><p>No, but there's not much point in using .NET if I'm not using the library that comes with it. And the design of the library does tie my hands in some cases.<p>I think the author makes a great point about libraries that use exception handling blurring the line between bugs and expected problems.

For instance if you're selling small business websites to dentists maybe that's ""go type in ""dentists"" on Google, and see who's advertising, and then click through and hit the ""contact"" button"".<p>b) At scale you can then pay somebody else to do the work for you, large list brokers like InfoUSA have millions of consumer and business records for you to reach out to.<p>c) Get caffeinated, find your courage, and pick up the phone to start placing phone calls.<p>d) Based on your interactions build yourself a script (or at very least bullet points) that gives you an outline of how to contact the customer including FAQ that you encounter.<p>e) Build with the end in mind of bringing in your first ""inside sales"" person. You want to literally turn over a handbook of how you're working this process. Throw out a juicy commission on orders, and then rinse and repeat.<p>This takes work, but it's an extremely efficient way of building your business particularly for B2B.",1321293156

3234856,comment,3233526,3233526,3,0,dasil003,,,"Exceptions vs error codes seems closely related to dynamic vs strong-typing ala Haskell.<p>If you use error codes exclusively, then it's possible to do much stronger reasoning about all code paths, and you can create a more robust system.  It doesn't have the magic of the static analysis that Haskell's type system enables, but there is a certain ""purity"" in that no function can have an error pass through it in the call stack without being aware of it.  This is exactly what you need in systems programming like an OS kernel where every conceivable thing will go wrong and your goal is to handle <i>everything</i> gracefully.<p>On the other hand, when writing business apps, you not only have the technical concerns of the system, but your program is primarily a big hairy rat's nest of business logic which may never achieve well-definition.  In such circumstances, you never get to a point of stability where you can be so pedantic about the technical details because you have your hands full just trying to meet the ever-changing business requirements.  Exceptions are a great help here because they allow you to handle new errors with minimal ceremony and function redefinitions.  Just like Ruby duck-typing, this means you can refactor faster, but obviously in a dramatically less robust fashion than Haskell.  But if you're operating in an environment where a logical failure here or there is acceptable and code has a short half-life, then you'll get better ROI from duck-typed, unit-tested, exception-notifying code than you will from nearly-impossible-to-fail statically-typed code.<p>A lot of code probably falls into a gray area where it becomes largely a matter of programmer taste.",1321292405

If he's figuring on a $50 or so cost of acquisition when optimized, he's going to need to budget at least $1,000 or more (that's just _20_ conversions) to even start figuring out if Adwords will work for him.<p>Cold calling makes sense, but he's comparing apples to oranges in saying he didn't get sales via adwords but he's getting leads via calling. He's spending an order of magnitude more at any reasonable conversion of time to money, and he doesn't know yet if these cold calls are going to convert, either. It's just that it's ""cheaper"" to do because he's not paying himself to do it, whereas AdWords is cash out of pocket (a valid issue but not one he's making.)<p>If he tested Adwords and found a formula that worked to create conversions, he'd have a scalable solution. Even if he gets great at cold-calling, it's unlikely he'll have a scalable solution unless he intends to hire a raft of salespeople (who will probably not be as good as he is as selling the product, and who have to be paid.)<p>It's entirely possible this is simply not a product that will do well on SEM, because people aren't actually out there searching for it, while potential leads are relatively easy to obtain and call.  That's true of a lot of middleware products.

Propaganda certainly has the connotations that you're looking for, but in English it's typically used to refer to a certain class of political ads. I get what you're saying, though, and I think the proper response is education.<p>Craigslist is great, and <i>I</i> might consider a subscription to Salon.com if it were inexpensive enough, but I think you're overestimating humanity's willingness to part with cash. All you have to do is look at just about ANY paid app on an iPhone or (especially) Android, and you'll find people complaining that it should be free.<p>Just a few years ago, buying a small game for your computer would cost from $7-$20. Now people complain if a game costs $1, even if the game contains dozens of hours of entertainment value. It's not like it costs less to make a polished game now than it did a few years ago.<p>And if a game is fun enough and has enough replay value, I can actually make more than the $0.70 I make from a $1 sale by showing the users ads (considering I get 200x as many downloads of a free version). Other models do exist -- in-app payments for buying ""coins"" to play a game more, for example -- but some of those end up feeling more evil than the advertising you're decrying.<p>What you'd need to fight is the sense of entitlement that people have around web content, which is what game developers have to fight on Android. I mean, just look at the comments on this very article! We're talking HN readers who feel entitled to get everything for free. People who have no connection with web site creation or running a business will typically have even less of a personal connection to the companies that they're hurting when disabling ads.<p>Micropayments for news sites could happen if you got the right sites to buy in, but it's been tried again and again, so I suspect that it's the lack of customers rather than the lack of site support that's the problem. If you got the New York Times, Salon.com, and a half dozen other high-profile sites to join a micropayment network, so I could sign up ONCE and go to a lot of different news sites ad free, I'd like that as a customer. But I suspect that you'd see the same ratio of 200x as many people sticking with the ""free"" ad-supported sites.<p>But then again, it would be a hard sell for the New York Times, at least: They want $35/month for a full digital subscription. That's off by at least a factor of ten from what I'd be willing to pay, possibly more. I think I'd be willing to pay $8/month to a micropayment network that included unlimited access to at least a dozen or so sites ad-free, but the NYT is demanding a much higher payment for unlimited access, so it's hard to believe they'd take a much lower amount.<p>Finally, I wouldn't want the micropayments service to charge me every time I looked at a site. I don't want to think about using the web; I want to browse freely, without worrying that I'm spending money every time I click a link. So those micropayments would need to come out of a monthly flat rate, to be divvied up among the various sites I'd actually visited.",1321290707

3234726,comment,3233526,3234114,2,0,amalcon,,,"I think the real problem here is that JavaScript/Node.js is constrained by language choice to a hybrid continuation-passing/call-return style.  As straightforward as exceptions are in call-return, they are even simpler in CPS -- the exception handler is just a second continuation.  It's literally just a standard-form onError parameter.<p>The problem is that you <i>can't</i> write your whole program in continuation-passing style in JavaScript, because its call and exception mechanisms aren't designed for CPS.  There is no tail-call optimization, and you can't configure exception handlers manually.  That's a valid choice under the right circumstances, but it breaks CPS.",1321290362

I wonder if what might be considered malware could actually be a legitimate agreement between the user and the programmer?<p>Something like ""Instead of a subscription, I'm going to SMS these 3 numbers once a month and it's going to cost you five bucks""<p>This actually might bypass all the headaches folks are having with merchant accounts and payment plans and work out as something both the user and developer might like a lot better. If crooks can make millions charging for bogus SMS messages, why can't legitimate programmers use the same payment mechanism for stuff the users like?<p>Don't know. Just throwing it out there.

I'm surprised they didn't bomb worse.<p>My first job was to cold call on behalf of a charity for the blind, and I've also done a telesales job for short time, and got training in it.<p>First thing we learned the first day in both jobs was the way of structure a call to get interest. There were of course big differences, but a few very significant common takeaways. Incidentally there's a lot in common with this and being a good conversationalist or even generating attraction:<p>* You need to offer value. That means, you never ask to get anything off the bat. On the contrary, you seek to get them to feel that you're going to offer value.<p>* You set up drama that they want resolved. E.g. you offer insight about some situation that is emotional to the listener. For the charity for the blind, this was of course about creating sympathy. For the telesales, it was about describing some scenario that corresponded to a need the customer felt strongly about, such as spending more time helping their children read (the company sold children's books).<p>* You get the listener invested and hopefully make them contribute details to the scenario from their own background; e.g. explaining the problems with their business, for example, and starting to look for ways you can help them.<p>* You make statements that gets implicit buy-in from the listener unless they object. People don't like to object, and if this is done subtly, people will find themselves accepting your statements even when they initially disagreed with them.<p>* Then you give the customer hope that you can <i>help them</i> make things better. You've established yourself as having high value to <i>them</i>.<p>If you do it right <i>they will ask you</i> what they can do or how they can buy your product.<p>The overall structure is to start on a friendly high note, create drama and tension and bring the emotions down, then resolve the tension and offer up a solution while bringing the emotions up. Think Hollywood tear-jerker.<p>The scripts you quote on that page fails in that they don't set up a conflict or any tension that you can resolve for them. Just some bland statements about ""cutting the nonsense"".<p>I'd have done something more along the lines of ""I'm sure that like lots of other [small,big, type-of business] businesses (implicit buy-in to your statement, putting them in a group they identify with), you've been hit with chargeback fees that were totally bogus [addressing a conflict] and have had to fight with your processor to recover funds and (more similar stuff)... (ask how it's impacted their business, and show them you sympathize). What do you think you can do about it? (listen to their feedback). Well, we have a report that helps you solve some of these problems. (wait for them to ask what it costs) We'll e-mail it you for free.""<p>On top of this, voice, intonation and the level of excitement you manage to project makes a massive difference - the biggest problem in the training at both jobs was to go from sounding like you read from a script (because you did) to projecting well enough that you came across as believable. In my own experience, this latter is so much easier when you call yourself, rather than outsource it.<p>(EDIT: fixed formatting)",1321290252

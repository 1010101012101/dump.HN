658747,comment,658560,658560,0,0,pxlpshr,,,"While I agree with the context of your article (though sometimes it is VERY necessary to rebrand), I think you missed an important point on how to avoid rebranding woes. Most established companies tend to favor unique typographic or vague logo marks more often than detailed illustrations to avoid narrow definition and the hassles of a complete rebrand. By adhering to a simple and less specific brand mark, the logo becomes more organic in nature. Companies can redefine their marketing message and expand their product offering with flexibility.<p>Think about the most prominent web/software companies such as Google, Microsoft, Digg, Facebook, Vimeo, Flickr... most have unique typographic logos because features change overtime. Case in point, Flickr now supports video. The fashion industry is also a very good example of this. Non-specific logos allow them to build (and change) associations based on lifestyle photography. Why is this important? Product cycles are seasonal and generally very trendy/volatile.",1245088074

It's true that texts are overly expensive, but the amount of work that goes into a good text isn't trivial.""<p>For two reasons at least. One: the amount of effort that goes into a good text and Two it means that every one taking the class from a different teacher is either getting taught something different or being taught from some one else's notes.

658735,comment,658615,658615,0,0,russell,,,"Continuous Deployment is a very intriguing idea. I haven't tried it, but in the the limit it makes sense.  A few years ago I worked for a company that did large batch releases, scheduled every 3 months.  The first month was spent negotiating with product management over product requirements and writing functional specifications.  The next month was writing code.  The third month was fairly rigorous QA, so much so that there was usually another month to fix the problems that QA found.  The breakdown was 25% design documentation, 25% programming, and 50% fixing bugs that should have been caught in programming.  The quality of the code that made it to production was very good, except for one time where a single bug brought the company to its knees for a week.<p>More recently, I did a consulting gig a company that released every two weeks with a one week QA cycle that allowed for a round of critical bug fixes.  This was much smoother.  There were rarely any show stoppers and even those were so fresh in eveyone's minds that they were quickly fixed.<p>Neither place practiced TDD or even rigorous unit testing.  Testing was pretty much walking through manual scripts. It seems to me that continuous integration to production requires TDD or something close to it.  I also question whether it is appropriate for an application with fiduciary responsibility, but I would love to be convinced otherwise.",1245087698

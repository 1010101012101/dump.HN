That the body will reduce energy consumption at other times to compensate.  The overall effect of exercise on energy consumed by the body is minimal.  That is, exercise does not build metabolism and in the absence of increased food intake exercise will result in lower metabolism.  Try reading Good Calories, Bad Calories.

The reason people are apathetic about mathematics is it is presented like a dry and idiotic subject. A common complaint about word problems is ""this is contrived, why does the water tank have exactly that parabolic curve, pfft math sucks, I quit"" whereas the common complaint about questions that are pure symbol manipulation is ""this doesn't matter to me, I quit.""<p>By introducing questions more open endedly (Could you kick a door down?) you avoid making the question sound contrived. Open ended questions also lead to <i>generalization</i>. (Side note, I've worked as a tutor and coach, so yes, I have classroom experience). The students get to saying, ""well, we can't solve this question until you give us numbers."" They get several sets of numbers, and they begin to realize that the <i>method</i> for solving the problem is generalizable. They develop the formulas from the examples, and learn they could have answered the open ended question all along.<p>That's in stark contrast to the current model, where the formula is taught, and then specific examples of close ended questions are presented. The key to teaching mathematics is fostering exploration.<p>The very best illustration of this idea is the Ross Mathematics Program in Columbus, Ohio. It is a two month long ground up rigorous exploration of number theory and abstract algebra. And here's the best part, there is no background necessary. If you know arithmetic, you have enough to begin, because all you start with the axioms of the natural numbers. And yet, the students exit the program having proved that groups of order p are cyclic, the Quadratic Reciprocity Law, etc. Everything is learned through problem sets, which the students do at their own pace. Every theorem used is proved, and every new proposition is discovered.<p>Yes, it is a great deal of work, but nobody ever said teaching was easy work. <i>Passion</i> should be the #1 hiring criterion.",1271619606

The Pragmatic Programmer is quite old (published 1999). It provides a lot of useful (generalised) information on how to build a scalable, useable and easy-to-maintain application. The small handout that comes in the back of the book is also a great reference to keep next to your desk!<p>Coders at Work takes a slightly different approach.

Return on investment is much better, so investment is going to pick up.<p>The current airplane speeds actually help this argument. Once people are used to trips taking days, not weeks, convincing them to pay premium for something that feeds the speed addiction is easier.<p>I don't know what the technology will be, or how far it will go. It's very likely that it won't go as fast as airplanes. But already, with the limited reward, we have passengers ships that go over 40 knots (HSC Manannan). If I had to guess, catamarans, hovercraft-like, and ekranoplan-like technologies might play a role, but I really don't know where we'll end up. It will undoubtedly be difficult, but engineers don't roll over just because water is more viscous.<p>Similarly, conventional high-speed rail exceeded 300 knots in test runs. There's probably room to go up, but little reward for investment because right now you still have to compete with 400-500 knot airplanes. Once you don't, and people are willing to pay for any extra speed... who knows what will happen.<p>(Can you tell I'm an idealistic engineering student?)",1271618829

The utility of mathematics comes in the remarkable fact that a great deal of phenomena can be adequately modeled mathematically.  The focus of an algebra class ought to be in learning the language of algebra.  That is, in manipulating numbers in the abstract.  The application problems ought to be saved for physics, biology, economics, etc.  The result of an emphasis on so called real world problems in high school mathematics is a generation of students who are incapable of correctly manipulating algebraic expressions and equations.<p>I recently gave my college algebra class an equation.  It was a simple equation and all of them could solve it.  I then asked them for an example of an equation that had no solution.  Not a single person could provide an answer.  They can solve the word problems in the textbook but don't have the slightest clue about what these mathematical concepts actually mean.<p>Perhaps it isn't important that one need to manipulate algebraic objects.  I won't argue with this.  But let's not call solving word problems mathematics.  If you want to learn mathematics then grinding through the minutia and having the patience to understand the symbols is necessary.  You can't get around this.

It’s especially useless because people often end up consuming more calories when they exercise.""<p>Study, have shown that if your energy expenditure and take-in is the same as dieting, exercise can produce the same results.<p>I have this hypothesis that it is psychologically easier to exercise off weight than to restrict your diet below maintenance.<p>Reason why:
1. Less willpower for exercise. Once you are on the treadmill it's easy to continue, while for dieting you will need to control yourself for at least 8hrs.  So, comparing 15mins of control for getting started to exercise to 8hrs of control to diet, exercise significantly better.<p>2.Exercise release endorphins, ie you will be happier after exercising.  Dieting leaves you irritable and tired.<p>3. Exercise builds metabolism, so you will burn at rest[not as much as they would have you believe in some books]. Dieting slow metabolism.<p>4. At moderately high intensity exercise can reduce appetite.<p>Drawbacks to exercise:
1) Takes alot of time.  Walking at 4mph for 60mins only burns 340 calories for a 150pound man[or something like that]. So, in essence 3hrs of exercise by walk a day will burn 2 pounds a week[provided that you follow a maintenance diet]",1271618071

Throughout their growth and since acquisition they have hired many women in leadership roles that require them to be social. However, the piece that stands out to me is that Ms. Vijayashanker didn't just complain about it at first (and doesn't honestly seem to be complaining a whole lot now), she proactively made a way to interact more socially to shape the work environment to meet her preferences/needs (not to mention the fact that Mint let her bring in her own intern to make her work environment more suitable). I'm not an engineer, but from my limited experience any original, core engineering team is somewhat insular and its probably a good thing if your coders are coding rather than shooting the breeze around the water cooler, although I'm sure they didn't all have their mouths sewn shut. In that example at least, it sounds like it is more of a reflection on how engineers interact with one another (as compared to say, the marketing/PR leadership) than a reflection of the startup environment in general being hostile towards women.<p>I was at a conference recently and a few women were on a panel talking about the challenges facing women in founding a startup, and continued to emphasize and call attention to inequalities, without realizing that they were perpetuating the same stereotypes they bemoaned, until one woman raised her hand and said ""please just tell us about your company, what is next, how are you innovating? how did you raise VC money? we don't care about your kids"" (and i gave her a silent slow clap)<p>When women participate with strength and confidence in their merits, the gender differences are not the emphasis of the relationship (and if anything they can potentially have an advantage over men in some industries or occupations). In my experience working with a lot of intelligent and successful women, the ones who succeed the most are able to utilize the benefits of the obviously different female perspective at times but you come to just interact as humans working towards a common goal, not as two separate species that are cautious of each other.<p>Lastly, men and women alike should sometimes consider that the dynamic in the workplace might not have anything to do with how you look or whether you are black white or magenta, it might (gasp) have something to do with who you are and perhaps you might just completely suck at your job and annoy the shit out of people.",1271617280

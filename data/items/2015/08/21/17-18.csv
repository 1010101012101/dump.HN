For such a simple device (it&#x27;s just a voicecoil) you can get very precise alignment assuming it&#x27;s well designed mechanically (e.g. properly damped). Not sure about spinning mirrors like those used in barcode scanners, but I&#x27;m guessing gavos were preferrable at the time for things like this. Galvos were heavily used in laser light shows back then which would have been very popular when this was being designed. To be honest, when I heard single line LED display utilizing 2 mirrors (one for each eye), my first thought was &quot;Just like a laser light display.&quot; Clever, but relatively evolutionary if you know how existing tech worked at the time.<p>The other reply below/above isn&#x27;t correct about there being a pause between scans. A common implementation for rotating mirrors is to use an octagonal mirror [1]. With that implementation, there&#x27;s no pause. The image just jumps immediately back to the left/right.

It has support for a lot of experimental rendering algorithms (such as Metropolis Light Transport), which are not supported in production renderers. Due to Mitsuba&#x27;s modular structure it&#x27;s also incredibly easy to implement new algorithms, which makes Mitsuba a great framework for comparing rendering algorithms. A lot of papers use Mitsuba to compare their new algorithm to other algorithms.<p>Most production renderers use CPUs (just like Mitsuba). GPUs are incredibly powerful and some benchmarks show 400% speed improvements over CPU-based renderers. The problem is though is that GPU-based renderers struggle with the scenes that are used in production. Typical production scenes contain over 250GB of textures and over 10s of GBs of geometry (pre-tessellation).

That was the first time I faced difficulty, and I didn&#x27;t know how to deal with that. I&#x27;m still recovering from the problem but I&#x27;ve been able to identify some solutions.<p>1. Choose your peer group carefully. Your values will shift to those of your peers. In high school my friends were the smart kids. At first we were highly motivated and competitive and earned high marks, but that didn&#x27;t sit well with the rest of the class. We got excluded for being try-hards. Therefore the new game was to pass the class with the least amount of effort. When I went to college I associated with similar people. It was cool to pass with the least amount of effort. Make friends who have values that you want to have: people who value effort, not talent.<p>2. Don&#x27;t fall for the incentives trap. Your success gets measured by passing classes and getting good grades. It&#x27;s natural for humans to game the incentives. Your motivation shifts to doing well on the incentives. Instead view passing the class as a bare minimum. The goal is learning, the test should be an easy byproduct.<p>3. Learn how to handle failure in a healthy way, otherwise you&#x27;ll find yourself avoiding things that may lead to failure. When failure does come, try to stay positive. Don&#x27;t try to keep up appearance of success. Be open about your failures. Find somebody you can talk to 100% openly; a friend, your parents, your gf/bf, a sibling. Make sure that your self worth isn&#x27;t reliant on your success.<p>4. Don&#x27;t rely on willpower. Using willpower is a losing battle. Design your life so that you don&#x27;t need to rely on it. Set up meetings to do your homework with friends. Build good habits. Beware of slippery slopes. Now you&#x27;re skipping class once, in a year you&#x27;re skipping class entirely.",1440178158

That gives us almost 8,000,000 pairs where we know how similar their IQ score and DNA was.  That gives us almost 8,000,000 points we can plot into a 2D coordinate system (and we can of course also throw statistics at them).  It turns out that there is a clear correlation between measured IQ and measured SNPs (i.e., the point cloud is denser along a line).  In other words, there <i>is</i> a statistical relation between DNA and IQ.  This is a result that is extremely hard to explain away if one believes in nurture, SES, microaggressions, racism, ESL difficulties, etc.<p>Since it is such a rhetorically important paper, I hope somebody else can chime in with a proper citation (I can also swear that even though I downloaded it at a university library, it has somehow also ended up somewhere in the neighbourhood of Emil Kirkegaard).<p>This paper only gives us points at the lower end of IQ/DNA similarity, of course.  We already have numbers at the higher end where we know that the points still fit -- but it was possible to explain it away with nurture, SES, and all that.  There has been a longer chain of arguments for about a hundred years that counteracted that (adoption studies, parents who die when their children are young or unborn, divorce and remarriage, etc.) -- but since it was longer, it was easy to ignore.<p>---<p>Ian Deary runs the Lothian Birth Cohort study which is really interesting if you are at all interested in how people&#x27;s outcome in life differ and why (and to what degree it can be predicted and bad outcomes be prevented).<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Deary#Lothian_Birth_Cohort_studies"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Deary#Lothian_Birth_Cohort...</a><p><a href=""http://www.lothianbirthcohort.ed.ac.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lothianbirthcohort.ed.ac.uk/</a><p>The &quot;Newsletters&quot; links in the sidebar gives you access to PDF&#x27;s for the newsletters they send to the participants in the studies (and their relatives/caretakers).

You are basically asking me to find a short text using small words that is on the internet and tailored to precisely your beliefs (false or true), precisely your background knowledge, that describes thousands of well-done studies apparently without difficult maths and lots of numbers AND that is &quot;reputable&quot; in &quot;an area of controversy&quot;, which means you give yourself permission to dismiss anything if whomever you choose to hold in authority doesn&#x27;t like it.  That&#x27;s a tall order, especially since there are so many dimwits within education &quot;research&quot; who believe false things and who can&#x27;t do statistics.<p>A more forthcoming query from you that 1) showed that you had done your homework (you clearly haven&#x27;t), 2) told me what you know and don&#x27;t know, and 3) told me which precise points you don&#x27;t understand or aren&#x27;t yet willing to believe would -- naturally -- have produced a more useful answer from me.<p>I can tell, though, that a degree in education doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference in the efficacy of the teacher.  But their IQ does.  The IQ of the students matter, too.  The discipline and noise level in the class also matters.  It certainly also matters that the teacher knows the subject he or she is teaching.  There is also a correlation between how long a teacher has taught and how well he or she teaches -- probably a combination of a selection effect and a training effect but I don&#x27;t think anybody yet knows how much each matters.",1440177447

We looked at Square Register, but it's rather lackluster feature set ruled it out. Namely, it doesn't support multiple printers or printer queuing (ex. food items get sent to kitchen printer), it doesn't have a modifier system for items (maybe this has changed), and no employee features (clock-in/out) etc..<p>I would say it's good for a small shop without too many needs. As soon as you have to do funky stuff like modify orders (and report on them), you're better off looking elsewhere.<p>I would also caution people against using the wireless printers and go with hard wired ones instead. I know, wires are not fashionable, but they are damn reliable and predictable. The restaurant next door uses wireless STARs with their POSLavu system(should win an award for worst name), and a waitress there told me they constantly had problems with them, and missed orders, etc.<p>Also, for anyone wondering why these thermal printers are $300+ on a good day, they're built like tanks. I bought all the Epson TM printers for my friend from a bankrupt Chinese restaurant. When I asked the owner if he'd had any problems with them (they self tested okay), he said in his broken english something like ""even with roaches, they still print!""...<p>Well, I get them home and start pulling them apart to clean them, and they're FULL of dead roaches. Every empty space inside the printers was chock full of roach bodies. The circuit boards were caked with roach shit and all the feed mechanisms had ingested and ground up the roaches that got in their way. And ever single one of these printers still works flawlessly.<p>So yeah, they're worth the $400.",1361379489

Books are intentional - you've committed to a topic, and there's a finite amount of information to digest. When you're checking social media, you don't know what you're going to get, but it'll probably keep you occupied.  You're just consuming mostly trivial information, hoping something interesting happens on your screen.  It's like flipping through TV channels to pass the evening.  There's nothing inherently wrong with that, but it's probably something best kept in moderation. artursapek's post is about his observations on how people are increasingly consuming this information fast food in excess.",1361378449

If you're going to actually use functional programming, the trick will be learning the paradigm and not worrying about syntax.

I found things like curried functions and recursion much easier to grasp and use in Haskell than in Scheme when I was learning both simultaneously.<p>I certainly do not think that syntax is anywhere near why some people find Haskell hard to pick up.

5251176,comment,5250094,5250815,1,0,leoedin,,,"I think you're giving the MPAA/RIAA more credit then they're due. The driving force behind centralised peer to peer systems has always been convenience, curation and quality rather than fear. Gnutella and similar couldn't provide the same experience that bittorrent based systems did. Users got tired of not getting what they thought they were getting, and so when a technology with a superior user interface (torrents) came along, they adopted it. Although recently there have been successes in removing torrent sites, a large number ran for many, many years with no real challenges.<p>I don't think the RIAA/MPAA are advanced enough to ""cultivate a producer/consumer mindset"". Their actions in the last 10 years against all sorts of infringement methods (napster, kazaa, TPB, suprnova, Jammie Thomas-Rasset and others) are demonstrative of a rights organisation which didn't really know how to react to the huge piracy increase in the early 2000s. The record companies realised that their business model (sell CDs) was being obliterated by piracy. It took them years (and the lobbying of Apple and Amazon) to get to a point (todays DRM free digital download market) that they could compete. It wasn't so much that they managed to get rid of piracy, but that they provided a more convenient solution to consumers' demand (getting music) than piracy.<p>My original comment was made because, in reply to ""You can't stop the signal"", gtt said ""With enough money, you can. Unfortunately"". I would consider the results of the last decade of music piracy to be a fairly good indication that in fact you truly can't stop the signal. The only way that rights organisations have made any progress against piracy is by providing their own, higher quality, signal. That is something that I believe will translate into the 3D printing domain.",1361376388

I never intended to suggest ""blame the user"".<p>> If a user cant just go to a computer and simply use it, like say a library or book, then the computer and its champions are failing. Its not the users job to provide security.<p>If I ran a library and I found that my visitors were just passing the same library card around to everyone in line, even strangers, instead of having each person get their own card, then I would say we needed some user education. We wouldn't need to issue special biometric IDs with a 22-step process to check out a book... but we would need to tell people ""Hey, get your own card!""<p>Similarly, if I find that my IT system users are entering their login passwords in <i>ANYTHING</i> other than the login box (particularly online forms), then I have failed them -- I have failed to educate them about basic use of the systems. I should correct that, by coming to them and letting them know that I will NEVER ask for their password in ANY place other than the login form, and that they shouldn't enter it anywhere else.<p>> Then, you tell them to limit emails. ""Oh right"" says the user, ""I thought one point of email was easy mass mailing, and now you want to bloke it?""<p>Actually, I wouldn't do it that way. I would set reasonable quotas (say, 100 outgoing emails before our rate limiting kicks in). After that, I would have it slow the rate of email sending, not block it. And if any user had sent enough that their mails were getting delayed, I'd also trigger a message to them inviting them to contact IT if they had special needs for mass emails. (We could change their quota, either temporarily or permanently, depending on what they were trying to accomplish.)<p>> Really think about the user.<p>Extremely good advice.

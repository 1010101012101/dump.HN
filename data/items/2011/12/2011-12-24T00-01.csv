Most of the outlier coders I know are 40+ now and don't work 80 hours weeks; nor do they ignore their families, etc. However, all did at one time in their lives, and all still have a strong work ethic.

3387767,comment,3387557,3387557,1,0,cesart,,,"Yes, do ask them to design something if that helps you, but make sure you're having him/her design something on the fly that's <i>related</i> to your product, not a real problem you're actually having currently. When interviewing for my summer position at Milk, a part of the application process was re-designing a product that was similar to what Oink could eventually be. The exercise is supposed to be theoretical anyway, so this just furthers the amount of time a designer has to think about the problems and to just get to the solution. This could also be a take-home assignment where they allocate Xhrs to the problem.<p>More than anything, recognize that the purpose of this exercise isn't to see the designer's abilities (you should be able to see this in their portfolio of previous work), but more about how they approach problems and how they think critically. Understand that no one can ever really outline their design process specifically, but should be able to speak to about the way they solved problems in the past (again, see portfolio) and how they came to solutions.<p>Talk to them about what they view as ""good design"" and why they think it. A good designer is ultimately a good communicator and should be able to talk you through why they think it's ""good"" (in their opinion).<p>Something that might provide insight is this Behance interview of Ben Barry, Facebook's communication designer: <a href=""http://the99percent.com/articles/7118/Facebooks-Ben-Barry-On-How-To-Hack-Your-Job"" rel=""nofollow"">http://the99percent.com/articles/7118/Facebooks-Ben-Barry-On...</a>. It's not completely specific, but it will give you insight into the way most designers (in Silicon Valley, at least) think about their jobs and their work.<p>Hope that helps!",1324687596

I think about lots of Emacs bindings mnemonically: C-b, C-f and friends, obviously, or C-c because that's just the ""bindings having to do with this mode"" key, and you see it a lot when you read documentation -- in my head, it's a letter, not a physical position. I touch-type Dvorak pretty fast, but two-finger type it <i>very</i> slowly, because in my brain the letters are wired to finger movements starting on the home row.<p>A possible reason for this is that he has an ""inverted T"" for cursor movement (but on the left hand, like vi, not WASD like I believe PC gamers would be used to). If your set of cursor keys is based on the physical layout of QWERTY, like vi, it doesn't translate all that well to Dvorak (vi manages to be not horrible since J and K stay next to each other, but in this proposal J and K are not on the same axis), but if they are mnemnonic, like Emacs, there's no problem.<p>If the idea is to fit better with what the vast majority of ""normal"" people expect computers to work... well, normal people use the arrow keys. Telling them an invented abstraction is better because they don't have to move their hands from home row isn't going to sell them, I think.",1324686836

The amount of effort and technology that goes into something as simple as buying a single hammer at the hardware store or turning on the faucet and getting fresh drinking water is stunning. The difference between what's required to support a Martian civilization and an Earth civilization is not so much a difference in fundamentals as it is merely a difference in degree.

122362,comment,122106,122344,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Who, me? Heck, no! I'm not convinced that I ever did, although at certain times in my career I used to claim that I did in a half-hearted fashion. The thing is, when someone asks you why you're studying physics they expect a more conventional answer than ""because I haven't gotten bored with it yet"".<p>I once flirted with trying to find a role as a non-tenured ""member of the technical staff""... I even did an experimental postdoc with that goal in mind. I eventually concluded that my enjoyment of doing science (as opposed to ""reading and writing about science"", which is rather more fun) wasn't really high enough to overcome the relatively low pay and the fact that I'd be subordinate to an academic bureaucracy throughout my entire career. In other words: if you like being a glorified postdoc, it may well be possible to do it forever, but you have to like it <i>a lot</i> to stay happy doing it for forty years.",1203828808

I know it sounds very tinfoil hat-ish, but I figure the ""Patriot Act"" was written long before those attacks that supposedly precipitated it.",1203828226

Respondents were given a +1 if they believe faith in God is necessary for morality; and +1 if they say religion is very important in their lives; and +1 if they pray at least once a day.""",1203828002

Who disagrees?<p>I can't wait to see this rebranching happen, but alas, it's the establishment.",1203827755

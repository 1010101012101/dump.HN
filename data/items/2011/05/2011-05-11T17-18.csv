I'm curious which idioms from your favorite dynamic language you find the most painful to adapt to a static language.<p>I think that the path forward for programming will see a convergence between static and dynamic typing, but the amount of static analysis that programmers do will only increase.  Certain dynamic practices such as name binding at runtime will fall out of favor, because that practice hampers static analysis.  On the other hand, static type systems in use will probably become more flexible, simultaneously increasing the things that they let you automatically track while decreasing the things that the force you to track.<p>Time will tell, I suppose.",1305136144

As the mother of a four month old who has had 95% of her care provided by either me or my husband working from home, and 5% by a grandmother coming to stay and watch her, I have learned that having a dedicated child care person is not only vastly superior for the working parents' productivity/quality of life, it is also superior for the child. My daughter made so many developmental strides while under the full attention of an adult, versus the divided, frazzled attention she received from a working parent. Having come to the realization that my bright and inquisitive daughter needs more than the partial attention of an adult, we have changed our minds about our ability to care for her while performing our jobs (work in my case, professional school in my husband's).<p>You might therefore consider what we are currently considering in our single-income household, which is to get an au pair. I am in the US, so program details/costs will differ, but here is my assessment based on the U.S. program. Since they are live-in, the cash outlay can be considerably less than getting a nanny. While there are substantial program fees, their salary is paid at minimum wage, which is generally half to a third (even a quarter) of a nanny's wage. If you live in an expensive area, the cost of an au pair can even be competitive with in-home daycares (which are typically the least expensive type of daycare). Other benefits include their childcare training from the program, the light housework they may perform, and the ""cultural exchange"" aspect of hosting a young adult from another country.<p>(If an au pair doesn't work out for us, our second choice would be to do a nanny share.)",1305134712

Gnome-panel has 20MB in resident memory (not all of it is code, mind you) - and 13 of them are shared with other processes. Unity-window-decorator shares over half of its code with others. Just for the kicks open your process monitor, have ""shared memory"" column open, and sum up all those numbers - those are megabytes you would have lost without the shared code.<p>It is also about CPU as well. Moving sort() implementation in and out of L2 cache is expensive, better to have a single instance of those opcodes do sorting for multiple processes.<p>Sorry, but our operating systems and programs we run on them are mostly composed of shared libraries.

The title is way too snarky, even besides the games/graphics switcharoo.<p>I used to want to be a games programmer, and even got my name in the thanks section of a well-received published game programming book.

To keep its dataset current I need a huge, continuous scraping cluster. I thought about letting people run a little thing in their system tray so that when the network interface on their computer is idle, it becomes part of my scraping cluster.

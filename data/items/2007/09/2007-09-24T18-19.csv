That kind of idea is indeed worthless. It's about your ability to make good judgements within a particular application context. <p>If you have that kind of knowledge and you are able to communicate with users then please please don't waste your time learning to program. If you have no special knowledge about a particular user community or industry then you should learn to program.<p>",1190660386

59005,comment,58985,58985,0,0,RyanGWU82,,,"I can't speak to YC specifically, but one normally would want to contact many investors in parallel.  The chance of receiving funding from any one investor is incredibly low.  If you contact them serially, you'll spend a hopelessly long amount of time raising money.  Likewise, if multiple investors are interested in your company, they may jointly invest, which is somewhat common.  Plus, you can use the competition to establish the fair market price of your stock.",1190659122

59003,comment,58949,58949,0,0,kcl,,,"In the Gmail Genius vs Clueless Manager comparison, I think it's more apt to say that the genius can traverse the tree and 'drill down' where necessary, applying the most effective changes at the necessary level of detail. The Clueless Manager is always stuck at the highest levels of abstraction, and he can only work with very blunt objects. The point is that the largest gains can sometimes come from optimizing disk-seek speeds, and being able to recognize (and correct) this is an advantage over only being able to talk about performance in generalized terms.",1190658893
59002,comment,58829,58984,0,0,zhyder,,,"Not really. For many high-tech companies, the earnings can vary a lot from one quarter/year to the next. If the profit margin is hovering in the +/-10% range, the P/E can vary wildly. Even in a low-earnings period, wall street will typically not punish the company too much if it expects things to turn around soon.<p>Regarding Salesforce.com in particular, looks like its 2006 profit margin was 9%, but 2007's was 0.1%. The street is still optimistic though, because the company's revenues increased 60%.<p>For such companies, the P/S ratio is generally a more reliable metric to compare with. Salesforce.com's P/S ratio is 8.8. For reference, Google's is 13.",1190658812

However, as recent Xobni's post on P/E ratio, has learned, it would make a lot of sense to apply financial ratios to startup's world, to at least check what you can expect etc. So, what is your net profit margin, and other profitability ratios, and what is your business model?",1190658615

Being a programmer for over 12 years and looking forward to my next startup, what I can tell you is that ideas do matter.<p>Consider this.The same amount of time that Google spend building a billion dollar startup is what a two bit outfit spends generating a million dollars. <p>Or another that goes belly up.<p>In other words ideas and execution equally matter. Maybe execution is a little more important. That's why Oracle dominates database software although initially there were multiple database startups (same idea).<p>A recent survey of forbes billionaires confirmed this. Many of them picked ideas over execution others picked execution.It all depends on the situation.<p>In any case, you can try building a prototype by using freelance sites such as guru.com or elance and then see what response you get from your target customers.<p>I think it is important to get feedback from would be paying customers.

This is probably a terrible thing to admit, but it has definitely been the single most difficult thing for me. I came into the job out of a love of writing, not a love of playing games. While I enjoy the interactive aspects of gaming, if a game doesn't have a good story, it's very hard for me to get interested in playing it. Similarly, I'm really terrible at so many things which most games use incessantly -- I have awful hand-eye coordination, I don't like tactics, I don't like fighting, I don't like keeping track of inventory, and I can't read a game map to save my life. This makes it very difficult for me to play to the myriad games I really should be keeping up on as our competition.""<p>However the link to the real interview is dead[1].

They have managed a spectacular feat, that has been 6 years in the making. This is a very exciting development but not just from a technical point of view. The Raspberry Pi represents the idea that computers are interesting to us intrinsically, that there is real value in providing a platform that allows for the development and satisfaction of a crucial intellectual curiosity. The true value of the Raspberry Pi will not be found in our mailboxes in the next few months. It will be in the possibility that the next generation will have something to hack on that prioritises learning and discovery over walled gardens.<p>Sorry for the preachy tone (it's not intended), I am sure that most people feel the same way (or something similar), but it feels like we have lost some perspective while getting up at 6am to order some electronics over the internet.

3647525,comment,3647348,3647348,4,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"See, this is why I left Reddit. Eventually you realize it's 4chan for collage educated adults, but 4chan none the less. Reddit has had this really weird sexist attitude for a long time. I've personally seen them attack women in comments MANY times. Redditors are very understanding when a male Redditor posts that he has been cheated on, the men gather together and discuss ways to get back. They see it from the male's point of view immediately. They upvote his submittion to the front page. When a woman Redditor posts her ""I think my boyfriend's cheating on me what should I do"", no one cares. No. One. Cares. In fact they try to see if it's something that she's done. As if it's her fault.<p>Anyway. As rude as this may be, this sounds like the behavior of ""Angry Virgins"" (not to insult them for being a virgin, I'm one myself). We came to this theory in another post:<p>When unattractive, undesirable men can't find a female mate they become sexually frustrated and begin to blame their problems on women. They become resentful of women because they feel unloved and rejected by them. This eventually leads to extremely sexist behavior, objectifying women as sexual objects that can be bought, and forming an opinion that ""women are evil"". This is why so many men find ""getting laid"" very important in their lives. Because to not have sex means that no one has found you to be desirable and worth pro-creating with. In other words, being a virgin makes many young men feel worthless and defective. So these young men turn against the women they feel ""rejected"" them.<p>This has been happening since the beginning of humanity. Despite women being the ones who give birth, origin stories such as the one in the bible state that women came from men. Despite men being responsible for nearly every great act of suffering, conflict, genocide, and world war, a large number of men believe that it is women who are ""evil"". Enough so that in the middle east women who reject a man's marriage proposal might find themselves doused with acid or gasoline and set on fire. (Be careful Googling this, the images are horrific)<p>Thousands of years later and we are continuing this trend. The only good thing that's come out of it, is that now we can more accurately identify sexually insecure men by looking at their level of resentment towards women. We now know that a significant number of Mass Effect players are angry virgins (not to be confused with happy virgins or indifferent virgins). I guess in a few hours, looking at how many downvotes I get, we'll know how many angry virgins there are on hacker news.",1330518778

3647489,comment,3647348,3647457,5,0,kevingadd,,,"It's unfair to say it's dominant. The problem is that EA management forces BioWare to aim for the (admittedly, quite large) segment of the gaming population that loves playing a big burly man who shoots other big burly men, because those games make an absolute truckload of money.<p>It may be true that Modern Warfare and Gears of War are absurdly profitable franchises - that's why BioWare is slowly turning Mass Effect into those games - but that doesn't mean that other types of games aren't popular, or that the average gamer only wants to play those games. You need only look at the most popular games on Steam to see evidence otherwise.<p>An important thing to consider, though, is whether Hepler's agenda - admirable though it may be - is actually right for Mass Effect or any of BioWare's games. If BioWare's customers want games that are heavy on gameplay and not story, trying to build a pure story game is probably unwise, unless your goal is to drive away all your existing customers and try to find new ones. You can do that, but it's usually not a good business strategy, and my wager is that EA shareholders wouldn't approve of it.<p>If you look at the trajectory of BioWare's games, over time, they've shed their gameplay sophistication, branching paths, and depth in favor of accessibility, action, and high production values. The emphasis on shooting men with guns (or, in the case of Dragon Age, stabbing men with swords) came along with that because those themes are wildly successful in modern sci-fi/fantasy films and test well with focus groups. When BioWare's remaining fans (not to mention former fans who were driven away by the new focus) hear a BioWare staffer calling for the games to have <i>less</i> gameplay, they're going to see that as someone driving their games further away from the classics that many people remember BioWare for - like Baldur's Gate. And it's no surprise to see a negative response for that.<p>As far as the content of the actual community response, I don't think it even bears mentioning that the sexism is unacceptable. Unfortunately, the community as a whole will likely never move past this, because games are popular with youth and the emotionally immature instead of just with adults.",1330517948

So i'm looking to some of the more ""analogue"" ways. I don't plan on connecting the device up to a monitor idenfinitely, and would like something like a ""Air Horn"" siren for example, if my site is down.<p>Do you think this would be possible? I could pick up a programmable USB power socket, but I can't really think of <i>any</i> other devices that I could connect via USB that would be <i>easily</i> programmable.<p>I don't want to bite the bullet and just build something that works through a monitor, cause I would like the ""analogue"" feel to whatever I first build.<p><i>Awesome-sauce</i> is a required for this project!

Bioware is lauded for its story telling and despite being an avid FPS player, I'm not playing Mass Effect or Dragon Age solely for the combat. If I was forced to choose I'd take a story only game for these, because brain-dead ""these are bad guys, shoot them"" are a dime a dozen.<p>I bought Mass Effect 2 almost six months before it got into my list of games I was playing, <i>because I love the story</i>. I play the Halo series over any other FPS because I love the story. I don't play CoD anymore because it voided the use of story almost a decade ago.<p>What I hate is seeing moronic, misogynistic, homophobic, redditards do this to a woman who's likely being part of the driving force for making Biowares female characters ""real"".",1330516828

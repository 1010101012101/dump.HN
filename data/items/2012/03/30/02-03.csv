3774288,comment,3773329,3773407,1,0,javajosh,,,"<i>> Google, phone manufacturers, and carriers all seem to have a distinct ""fire and forget"" mindset regarding phones. As soon as it's on the market they move on to the next one, and those of us locked into a 1 or 2 year contract are left in the dust.</i><p>Amen. One begins to realize that the serious upside of a monolithic product (e.g. the iPhone) is that your <i>reputation</i> is tied to a single product. With Android, there is no single company to blame for poor software support or constrained upgrade path (Google? HTC? AT&T?)<p>My sense is that Google is giving OEMs far too many options. The message should be, ""Hey OEM, here's the Android project. Do a git clone and install it on your phone. Then you can call it Android. If that's not good enough for you, do a fork and call it whatever you want, but don't you dare call it Android.""<p>I think that the tacit assumption when you buy a ""Google Phone"" is that it will have an upgrade path similar to the iPhone, and so free of the dysfunctional interplay between Google and the OEM (and, thanks to Google's weight, maybe even the carrier). But this has proven not to be the case. (Google still has a lot of explaining to do as to why the N1 doesn't get Android 4).",1333076350

It might attract interesting discussion, though that's mostly the luck of the draw.<p>What she's saying does have parallels in software. Being able to know <i>why</i> something is designed or coded the way it is is critical to good software work. That for me is the connection. I consult this kind of intuition all the time. For example, I had a massive breakthrough yesterday - something I've been banging my head over for months suddenly yielded to a simple solution - but the most compelling thing was that it was a moral solution in Cheng's sense: I can look at it and see not just <i>that</i> it works but <i>why</i>. Finding this solution brought a tremendous feeling of relief. But without the ""moral"" aspect, I wouldn't have felt nearly as good; I'd have seen the tests passing and things <i>appearing</i> to be correct, but there would have been less relief and more of the uneasy sense that it might fall apart with the next test case.<p>The material about social proof is reminiscent of De Millo, Lipton, and Perlis on the Limits of Formal Methods, which is also worth reading: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3554556"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3554556</a>.<p>Also, one of the most delightful things in the (Cheng) piece is the quote from Hume, showing that as so often, Hume got there before everybody else and said it best.<p>I still don't think it has the least thing to do with design patterns, though :)",1333075639

It's not as if just because marketers can't figure out how to program, the inverse is true and programmers for some reason <i>lack the creative thinking skills to come up with new ideas or the capacity to market their own product</i>.<p>Non-technical founders may have some purpose, but to a coder with marketing ability they're redundant, and worse, in the way.

Does it matter which minimal covering set you evaluate, or does your strategy need to be some kind of superposition derived from all the minimal sets?<p>Also, if there are some words that are never picked by your strategy, doesn't that open the door for an alternative set of question paths that only covers the now-reduced dictionary? (cue reference to the Unexpected Hanging Paradox)<p>In many ways, the entropy is a heuristic for finding a good question path given the known probabilities for each word in the dictionary.  The formula that I quoted above can be trivially extended for nonuniform distributions of the chosen words.  It sounds like the Nash equilibrium would be designed such that (after eliminating dominated strategies), the expected information gain at each step would be the same for all question paths.

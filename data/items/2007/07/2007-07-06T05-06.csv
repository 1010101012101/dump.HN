The part that seems somewhat off is the comparison of investment bankers/lawyers/doctors and entrepreneurs. Being a professional who sells his time is very different from being an entrepreneur that creates a successful business. How many lawyers or doctors could retire at age 30?

Actually, I was really impressed about the certification I would fail. All the other ""how to hire"" articles so far were like ""check that the candidate can add 2+2"". And I wish I knew more about the methods you propose. <p>Isn't there always a lurking feeling of ""there has to be a better way"" in programming?",1183700365

They're not forced to play by Wal-Mart rules if they decide to play a different game.<p>You think it's ridiculous to pay retail workers well. A lot of people think the same thing about Google's perks for engineers. Google has profited immensely from their thinking, and Costco has as well. There's more to running a successful business than what shows up on an SEC filing form.

I'm simply saying that it seems that many successful people are successful because of their passion and the fact that they'd do the same thing even if it wasn't lucrative. I think that's great. <p>I define freedom as control over your time, and I was trying to say that you don't need a ton of money to gain control over your time and that it's almost impossible to control your time when you're working for someone else. You're best off figuring out a way to generate passive income. ",1183698322

Even Einstein, from his patent office published at least 5 papers in 7 years. That&#x27;s a pretty decent rate considering it wasn&#x27;t even his fulltime job, and a PhD student working as such would probably be considered proficient(then again, I&#x27;m not aware of the paper rate of physicists).<p>I&#x27;ve met a lot more people in research who would just do nothing without deadlines than hidden geniuses that are hindered by their deadlines.

His only valid success criteria seems to boil down to something similar in meaning of &quot;An acceptable lisp is a lisp that every single programmer uses it&quot;.<p>1.\n&quot;Killing adoption&quot;? For what goal? People have different thought process, each dialect will be more natural for a certain subset of people. Offering dialects and diversity in choice is a good thing. I have only limited experience, last semester when i graduated i took a SICP course and now i have read through On Lisp because i thought macros sounded powerful, so i am going to be programming a hobby project in Common lisp. But that doest mean i want Scheme to disappear from the world.<p>2.\nLibraries.<p>3.\nI haven&#x27;t used CLOS much so i can&#x27;t really say anything. But making complaints that things are &quot;bolted on&quot; Common Lisp because of the macro system seems to me that he has missed the point of what people like with Common Lisp and its macro system.<p>4.\nCan&#x27;t one use Scheme if one wants portable hygienic macros?\nI can agree somewhat with the macro situation and my own research seems to point this to the historical decision to pass on fexprs to gain efficient compilers. The plus side is that macros can expand macros means is generally works. And i don&#x27;t get this &quot;band-aid&quot; notion. From what i understand macros are argument to use lisp and should be utilized.<p>NewLisp offers fexprs and is focus on interpreted, which means that at any time you have access to a functions definition to use for self-modifying code and eval is blazingly fast compared to other lisps that support compilation. I want to start experiment with true ai that can modify its behaviour in newLisp soon. This is also an argument on point 1 of the diversity of lisps.\n( yet i guess you could in common lisp use a macro that always saved the interpreted function definition in some global has that you could operate on in a macro dsl )<p>On a closing note i would like to add that it isn&#x27;t really important to attracts people to lisp. Infact from an ethical standpoint trying to sway people which tools they &quot;need to use&quot; is questionable. And in a similar spirit of the HN article &quot;People don&#x27;t like creativity&quot; i am not convinced that everyone actually would prefer lisp even if we lived in a world where lisp were as popular as C# and Java together.<p>Every programmer will hear about lisp at some point and if they are interested in it they will probably explore it.",1386412909

This is a wild conspiracy &quot;theory&quot; [1] pushed by Nanex for publicity, but it&#x27;s almost certainly false.<p>If it were true, it would be trivially easy for any of the broker, exchange or SEC to trace and shut down. These parties already have countermeasures in place to prevent you from doing this accidentally - you need to make sure the rolling average of your fill rate is above 0.5% (approximate cutoff, it varies but it&#x27;s in that neighborhood).<p>Further, the risk of getting filled makes such a strategy insane.

Yes, he is very keen to satisfy media outlets and spread support for Abenomics. He has been jingoistic, using patriotic rhetoric to amass votes from nationalistic and conservative people alike.<p>Yet, when it comes to leadership in Japan&#x27;s political arena, there are hardly any viable candidates. I had high hopes for the former-ruling DPJ, which ended up as three years of abrupt administrations. Voters once believed that DPJ, with its emphasis on national welfare, can improve Japan, but switched back to LDP not because the former party appeared attractive, but merely because it is the least appalling party among the many.<p>What Japanese voters appear to want is a stable regime while turning a blind eye to their increasing draconian policy that exploits the diplomatic fear against our East Asian neighbors. LDP is currently taking advantage of their most favorable term by passing many legislation to promote their conservative agenda.<p>It would be overly simplified to remark that Abe is the worst politician. Stock market average soared since he returned as prime minister. Despite the heinous copyright agreements, the TPP ostensibly promotes free trade in other sectors such as agriculture. And we’re approaching the first anniversary of Abe’s leadership - and his regime still looks stable unlike the last months of Fukuda, Aso, Hatoyama, Kan, or Noda. (It would be fair to note that DPJ’s credibility crumbled partly due to the naturally-occured 3.11 earthquake.)<p>To improve Japanese politics, as a nation we have to invest in the younger generation. Hone better leadership skills so that eventually when they too enter politics, they can influence their colleagues effectively. Make the youth more interested in politics so that whenever a horrible legislation like this act on secrecy appears, a massive portion of voters protest, not unlike when the US Congress tried to pass SOPA/PIPA. Clearly, Japanese politics doesn’t appear have a bright future as of now.",1386410772

He spent 1901-1908 working in the patent office while releasing papers outside of Academia. Only in 1908 he was appointed lecturer in acknowledgment of his existing works.<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#Patent_office\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#Patent_office</a><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus_Mirabilis_Papers#Special_relativity\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus_Mirabilis_Papers#Special...</a><p>If you want to figure out what&#x27;s wrong with Academia I suggest asking economists who deal with incentives and market forces as a subject of research as opposed to the anecdotes of a few well-meaning physicists. Yes, the physicists are clearly smarter. But with few exceptions they&#x27;re just not trained or equipped to asses these problems.",1386410692

Might be good to make that clear before the signup.<p>* You have a competitor called BitcoinReminder.com who track several different currencies, a few more exchanges, and even offer alerts via Jabber / IM (as well as Email & SMS).  Their site isn&#x27;t as cleanly designed as yours though, and it&#x27;s a paid service (whereas it seems yours is free for the moment).  They&#x27;ve just signed up their 2000th user after 2.5 years, which might give an idea of market size.<p>But it&#x27;s a neat idea & a good name for it too!",1386410556

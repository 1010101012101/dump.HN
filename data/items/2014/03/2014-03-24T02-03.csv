7456449,comment,7455757,7455922,27,0,mbrubeck,,,"The software industry has been growing rapidly in recent decades, and the growth has been concentrated in a few geographic areas.  So employers in those areas (especially Silicon Valley, and also smaller hubs like Seattle and Boston) have to recruit a lot of their workers from other regions, as their job openings grow faster than the &quot;organic&quot; growth of the local worker population.<p>Theory: This importing of workers has negative effects on age and gender diversity, since it means a higher proportion of jobs go to people who can easily relocate for work.  That includes young people (who are less likely to have kids and/or spouses) and men (who more often receive the primary or larger income in a household).  I&#x27;m sure you can think of other things that are advantages or disadvantages when it comes to moving to California for a job.<p>There are ways to test whether this effect exists and how large it is.  For example, you could compare age and gender diversity across industries.  The theory predicts that age/gender imbalance is correlated with geographic concentration of employment growth for each industry.  You could also see whether these imbalances are worse within industry hubs, compared to companies in the same industry outside the hubs.  (Though the effect can also spread outside the hubs if it influences a culture that gets exported to the rest of the industry.)<p>I&#x27;ll bet geographers or sociologists have published research on this subject, though I don&#x27;t know enough to search for it effectively.  (I found some vaguely related papers on Google Scholar, but nothing yet with data that would directly answer these questions.)  There are some historical parallels of course, like gold rushes and resource extraction booms that cause new industries to grow suddenly in a particular area.",1395629954

The data seems to clearly support the relation between state funding and tuition costs, and yet less substantiated claims continue to rise to the top.<p>Do I think college administrations could stand to lay off some people? Sure. Does that mean that those extra employees are the reason I&#x27;m saddled with $40k in loans? Hell no.

I can&#x27;t afford the in state public university in my home state, so I had to move here, as ridiculous as that sounds. Luckily, NYC is not nearly as expensive as people make it out to be. I pay about $200/month more in living expenses, but it&#x27;s $10,000/year cheaper to go to school here and I get free health care through medicaid (important since I have a very painful health condition). I have no family support, so I have to make it work through, well, work and what little money I can get from federal financial aid.<p>I&#x27;m really grateful CCNY still exists to provide me a path out of poverty.

You could do that with a flat team where everyone knows everyone else and operate out the back of an established retail business.<p>Scaling that up would mean having three tiers of management, scores of interns, nobody knowing the names of anyone in the warehouse, the product team not talking to the customer care team, whole departments dealing with accounts things, it just goes on.

A lot of colleges that the thirty and under set that I&#x27;ve talked with don&#x27;t always have a required path in CS that teaches systems and architecture, let alone C (or assembler).  So, if one expect such from someone with a CS degree, that could be an issue.<p>The tooling accessible to people today as opposed to those that started 10 years prior is also extremely different.  Running Windows?  Trumpet Winsock, understanding the win.ini, config.sys, and autoexec.bat were important.  Linux - a lot of people have wasted a lot of time getting sound and video drivers (as well as xf86config files) to work right, most just work fine now.  All these required a level of digging that required knowing more about the system than you may have wanted.<p>Not saying your point isn&#x27;t valid, but it does depend on what one&#x27;s definition of &quot;competent&quot; is.",1395629608

Building a payroll system with a NoSQL back end and an AWS front end is &quot;different&quot; than building the same with an Xwindows client and an Oracle back end, but the things that may a payroll system &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; often have nothing to do with the bricks and mortar and more to do with the kinds of things that typically go wrong or requirements that are left unstated.

I suspect it&#x27;s not total, but there&#x27;s probably some overlap.<p>I can&#x27;t wait until these 22 year olds of today hit their 40s and they reap what they&#x27;ve sown.<p>Zuckerburg said &quot;younger people are just smarter&quot;?  Certainly there&#x27;s a degree of hubris in youth that you don&#x27;t lose without experiences of failure and compromise.  But that&#x27;s usually not &quot;smarts&quot; - just youth.  I&#x27;ve had similar encounters with people where I&#x27;ve been able to guess parts of their business (and failures), and it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve already had my own.<p>One example - pardon the long rant...<p>I did a bit of prototyping with some college students about 15 months ago.  Core idea was &quot;coursera/udacity for medical students&quot; - something like that.  Being medical students, they saw a lack of useful material focusing on them, and wanted to fill that niche.  &quot;You&#x27;ll have trouble getting content, and will likely run in to IP issues with professors and universities&quot;.  I said this within the first 10 minutes of meeting them.  &quot;Oh no, we&#x27;ve already got people lined up, ready to create content,&quot; was the reply.<p>That intrigued me, because content is the hardest part.  We met again, and again, and I did a small (small - like weekend prototype) set of code to let people upload instruction content based on the structure we&#x27;d laid out.  Then.... nothing.  Days to weeks to months... Nothing.  What happened?  They mistook &quot;hey, great idea! yeah, I&#x27;ll do it&quot; sort of nice/polite feedback as real commitment.  The few instructors who actually were interested in going further discovered they had to clear their involvement with their respective universities, as it seemed to constitute teaching and would conflict with their existing contracts (IIRC it could have been worked out with money/licensing, but there was no revenue at this point).<p>So... months later after a lot of legwork on their end, they came to the conclusion that I&#x27;d come to after 10 minutes.  That&#x27;s not to say &quot;Ha, I was right, dumb idea&quot; - the idea <i>will</i> happen, imo.  They just sort of ignored me - I was an &#x27;outsider&#x27; - they &#x27;knew the space&#x27;, etc.  I&#x27;m the old guy who&#x27;s not at university - how could I possibly know what student life is like <i>now</i>, in 2012?  They could have saved themselves a lot of time by focusing on the issues I&#x27;d identified up front (which... was not just tooting my horn here - an older colleague identified the same issues on the same initial evening meeting).<p>But hey, &quot;younger people are just smarter,&quot; right?  Nothing is so cut and dried.  Smarter people are smarter, energetic people are energetic, etc.  There are 50 year olds that run rings around many 25 year olds that I know, both physically and activity-wise.",1395629427

7456426,comment,7455757,7455757,6,0,mwfunk,,,"I dunno. I can think of three ways in which an older developer might have a hard time finding a job:<p>(1) If someone doesn&#x27;t keep up with currently relevant technology, they will find themselves without the job skills that employers are looking for, regardless of whatever other qualities they may have. This isn&#x27;t ageism.<p>(2) If someone works at the same place for 10+ years, getting raises every year and becoming more and more valuable because of their knowledge of the innards of one or more huge codebases that are specific to that company, they&#x27;re likely to have a hard time finding another job doing something different that pays as much or more. It&#x27;s very easy for people to settle into a routine for many years that doesn&#x27;t necessarily carry over to another job. Someone in this situation might have to take a pay cut (maybe a big one) to start from square one doing something else at another company. This is an unfortunate reality of being a software developer, but it also isn&#x27;t ageism.<p>(3) If a really young entrepreneur is hiring for their startup, and they haven&#x27;t had the life experience to develop the maturity and insight to avoid being biased towards hiring people who are just like them, it is possible that they will favor a younger developer over an older developer based on age alone. They may not even be aware that they&#x27;re doing it, they might just feel like all other things being equal, the younger developer is a better fit for the company. This could be ageism sometimes, and it&#x27;s very unfortunate when it is.<p>(1) and (2) are the perils of having a long career as a developer. Employers who don&#x27;t hire someone because of these reasons are making rational hiring decisions; they&#x27;re not making decisions based on being biased against someone because of their age.<p>I don&#x27;t know how often (3) happens though. I could see it being a problem in SF, where I&#x27;ve heard the job market is disproportionately composed of startups. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s like that in the South Bay (at least not to the same degree), where there are tons of large and established companies that are less likely to do this.",1395629344

One huge factor is the corresponding increase in financial aid, particularly at top institutions——if you came from a poor family several decades ago, you would have had to work your way through Harvard, now you will get full aid and can even get grants for summer activities.<p>That&#x27;s honestly a huge boon to meritocracy which we should not forget about. All these people pushing for the elimination of aid and a shift to market mechanisms need to seriously consider the impact that a zero-aid, market-based system would have: a return to a time when only the wealthy could attend great institutions and everyone else is relegated to community colleges and second-tier state universities. That&#x27;s what market mechanisms are great at: matching products to people&#x27;s ability to pay.<p>I dearly hope we don&#x27;t actually want that for our country. It undermines the very meritocracy we pride ourselves on——if we can&#x27;t get an equal education, regardless of economic ability, then the rest of the market-based American economy is a sham of wealth perpetuation.<p>---------<p>On a completely different note, I do actually think it is possible to work full-time during college.

7456332,comment,7455991,7455991,4,0,lord_quas,,,"Apple Inc. AAPL +0.79% is in talks with Comcast Corp. CMCSA -1.20% about teaming up for a streaming-television service that would use an Apple set-top box and get special treatment on Comcast&#x27;s cables to ensure it bypasses congestion on the Web, people familiar with the matter say.\nThe discussions between the world&#x27;s most valuable company and the nation&#x27;s largest cable provider are still in early stages and many hurdles remain. But the deal, if sealed, would mark a new level of cooperation and integration between a technology company and a cable provider to modernize TV viewing.\nApple&#x27;s intention is to allow users to stream live and on-demand TV programming and digital-video recordings stored in the &quot;cloud,&quot; effectively taking the place of a traditional cable set-top box.\nApple would benefit from a cable-company partner because it wants the new TV service&#x27;s traffic to be separated from public Internet traffic over the &quot;last mile&quot;—the portion of a cable operator&#x27;s pipes that connect to customers&#x27; homes, the people familiar with the matter say. That stretch of the Internet tends to get clogged when too many users in a region try to access too much bandwidth at the same time.\nApple&#x27;s goal would be to ensure users don&#x27;t see hiccups in the service or buffering that can take place while streaming Web video, making its video the same quality as Comcast&#x27;s TV transmissions to normal set-top boxes.\nWhile devices such as Microsoft Corp.&#x27;s MSFT -0.42% Xbox gaming console and Roku Inc.&#x27;s set-top box have made some inroads in the TV industry, none offer the kind of fully formed TV service, with the guarantee of network quality, that Apple desires.\nApple has spent several years exploring various avenues to enter TV, but it has been unable thus far to find business models that media companies and cable providers find appealing.\nGetting the support of Comcast would give Apple&#x27;s plans a big boost. The companies share a common goal: advancing set-top box technology so that TV more closely resembles the easy-to-use apps and streaming-video services to which consumers are growing accustomed. Innovation is becoming a high priority for content-owners and operators amid pay-TV subscriber losses and fears that a younger generation of consumers will forgo paying for TV altogether.\nApple and Comcast aren&#x27;t close to an agreement, said one person familiar with the talks. Delivering the service quality Apple envisions would require Comcast to make significant investments in network equipment and other back-office technology, according to people familiar with Comcast&#x27;s thinking.\nThe companies also differ on how deep a relationship Apple should have with Comcast&#x27;s customers. Apple has proposed that users would sign on to the new device using Apple login IDs, and it is interested in controlling customer data, the people familiar with the matter said. Apple also has asked for a cut of the monthly subscription fees paid by customers, these people said.\nComcast wants to retain significant control over the relationship with customers and the data.\nFurthermore, Apple must acquire significant TV programming rights from media companies, one of the people said. Comcast would want to ensure that the price Apple has to pay to acquire rights wouldn&#x27;t cause the service to be priced higher than traditional pay-TV service, this person said.\nApple has had discussions since at least mid-2012 with Time Warner Cable Inc., TWC -1.34% the No. 2 operator, people familiar with the matter said. Those talks, known internally at Time Warner Cable as &quot;Project Jupiter,&quot; came to a standstill when the cable operator became a takeover target, the people said. Comcast in February agreed to acquire Time Warner Cable for $45 billion, a deal regulators are reviewing that would give Comcast a total of 30 million U.S. customers, after proposed divestitures.\nUnder the plan Apple proposed to Comcast, Apple&#x27;s video streams would be treated as a &quot;managed service&quot; traveling in Internet protocol format—similar to cable video-on-demand or phone service. Those services travel on a special portion of the cable pipe that is separate from the more congested portion reserved for public Internet access.\nPeople familiar with the matter said that while Apple would like a separate &quot;flow&quot; for its video traffic, it isn&#x27;t asking for its traffic to be prioritized over other Internet-based services.\nThose distinctions are important because of merger conditions Comcast agreed to as part of its 2011 acquisition of NBCUniversal. Those &quot;net-neutrality&quot; restrictions, which will be in place through 2018, say Comcast cannot &quot;unreasonably discriminate&quot; in how it transmits network traffic.\nThe Federal Communications Commission is in the process of drafting net-neutrality rules for the broadband industry after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in January tossed out an earlier set of regulations the agency had in place.\nThe FCC has signaled that its new rules will prevent Internet service providers from blocking or slowing down access to Web content providers that don&#x27;t pay a toll. It isn&#x27;t clear what approach the FCC will take to a situation in which a provider such as Apple wants enhanced treatment for a cloud-based service in partnership with an operator.\nThe FCC also could consider net-neutrality proposals as part of its review of the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal.\nUnder the FCC rules the court struck down, broadband providers were allowed to treat managed services differently from public Internet traffic. The agency noted the potential risks, however, if broadband providers invest too much in specialized last-mile services but &quot;constrict or fail to continue expanding network capacity&quot; for the public Internet.\nComcast could see value forming a partnership with Apple to add and retain customers. In addition, the Apple device likely would be sold at retail to customers rather than leased through the cable operator like a traditional set-top box—something that could reduce Comcast&#x27;s capital expenditures over time, said one person familiar with the talks.\nAt the same time, though, Comcast has been aggressively investing in and deploying its own Internet-connected set-top box and guide—dubbed &quot;X1&quot;— that far eclipses capabilities of its old boxes. To date, Comcast has limited the managed-video services it offers only to its own cable TV services.\nApple&#x27;s interest in separating its streaming-TV service from ordinary Web traffic highlights growing concerns in the media industry about the Internet&#x27;s ability to handle the increasing consumer demand for online video.\nNetflix Inc. recently agreed to pay Comcast to directly connect to the cable provider&#x27;s network to improve the quality of its streaming-video service. That &quot;interconnection&quot; deal was different from Apple&#x27;s proposed approach in that it didn&#x27;t address how Netflix&#x27;s traffic would be treated over the &quot;last mile&quot; to households.\nThe arrangement Apple is seeking could give it a leg up over other new entrants vying to offer online versions of pay-television service, such as Sony Corp. 6758.TO +3.47% , whose traffic would travel over the public Internet.\nAnticipation built about a breakthrough TV offering from Apple after founder Steve Jobs told biographer Walter Isaacson three years ago that he &quot;finally cracked&quot; a way to revamp the television. But Apple&#x27;s only television product since then has been Apple TV, which offers users access to iTunes movies on the larger screen of a television as well as streaming video from Netflix, Hulu and other online services.\nThere is some precedent to the kind of deal Apple is seeking with Comcast. The cable operator has a years-old relationship with TiVo Inc., TIVO -1.20% the DVR pioneer, which allows subscribers to receive Comcast TV service through TiVo boxes they buy at retail stores and, in some markets, with certain newer boxes access Comcast&#x27;s on-demand library.\nApple&#x27;s proposal is different than TiVo&#x27;s in that it has sought a share of customer fees and a deeper relationship with customers and content owners.",1395627396

I was getting paid a relatively low salary and was expected to work insane hours.  My accountant friends were probably making more money out of school.

There are three outcomes I foresee: 1. the status quo, 2. a company w/ deep pockets (Apple, Google, Netflix, etc) convinces a major sport to take their money, or 3. piracy of live sports streams becomes more reliable and easier to consume. #2 is possible but would still be a big gamble.

Sadly, you can&#x27;t just fire someone without first giving them a chance to turn things around. Nothing motivates better than fear, but it can also cause people to become resentful towards the company.<p>You need to pull each employee aside, especially the manager(s) who should be ensuring efficiency is kept at acceptable levels. This sounds like a double-edged problem. Employees not realising they&#x27;re dropping in efficiency and managers not noticing the drop in performance and also failing to do anything about it if they have noticed. Sounds very much like a safety in numbers scenario at the moment.<p>All you need to say is, &quot;Hey, we&#x27;ve noticed you&#x27;re not performing as well as you have in the past. Is there a problem we are not aware about, is there anything preventing you from doing your job properly? Lack of resources, lack of proper tools, personal issues? Are you being asked to do too much, is the work too difficult and is there anything we can do better to make it easier for you to do your job?&quot; but at no point should you start pointing fingers and placing blame upon people.

If the work isn&#x27;t stimulating or challenging people will grow bored as well, there is usually more than one answer to a problem. Are unreasonable time frames and expectations being placed upon your employees? If you&#x27;re asking for things to be done within 2 weeks, but it should be a 3 week job, who is to blame? The business imposing unreasonable time frames or the employees who have to try and get the work done within said time frame?<p>The fact you&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s a twelve person team and it&#x27;s the whole team to me signals it is a management problem.

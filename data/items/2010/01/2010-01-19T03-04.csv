What part of ghosts, yoga as spiritual, etc do you see as respecting the scientific process?<p>> (The US is actually a rather startling exception, if you look at a graph of popular religiosity versus any number of metrics of a healthy, successful society.)<p>You're assuming that religiousity taints all.  It didn't have that effect on Knuth (who is extremely religious).<p>That's why I pointed out that not believing in evolution or ""old earth"" isn't necessarily a handicap.  You can argue that it is, but then you get to explain Knuth and deal with ghosters and the like.  (Surely you're not going to argue that creation and new earth are the only misbeliefs that matter.)<p>>> Ah yes, the folks who think that fire can't melt steel....<p>> WTF...?<p>A significant fraction of ""the reality based community"" consists of ""truthers"".  One of their core beliefs is that 9/11 didn't happen the way it looked like it happened is because the planes ""just"" spread fire through the world trade center.  However, they insist that something else took the buildings down because ""fire doesn't melt steel"".  (They apparently don't know that different things burn at different temperatures and melt isn't necessary.)<p>> Gonna call ""citation needed"" on that.<p>You don't think that ghosters participate in the body politic?",1263873443

There, we had much more credible circumstantial evidence pointing at the suspect in advance (e.g. the dad's phone call about him.)  That is a hundred times more damning than this Twitter post -- although still not terribly damning, if you ask me -- and yet, he flew.

Gaining center influence, threatening an opponent's weak group, cutting an opposing group into two groups, defending your own territory, making eyes, and reducing your opponent's territory are all important goals.<p>The best moves are ones that further two or more of these at the same time; it's very easy to lose if you're only concerned about one at a time.",1263870650

""The party is really gonna blow up"" or ""The roof will be on fire!"" Are these threats?  What if some paranoid idiot reports one as a threat--should the person that wrote it be fined or prosecuted because it wasted police time?  The authorities repeatedly show themselves to be morons...is it okay to rely on their discretion?<p>These are things I think society needs to start talking about.",1263870396
1061378,comment,1061171,1061289,0,0,Tichy,,,"The article tried to make it about lifestyle choices, but it also mentioned the economic necessities. What I said is that I think the economic necessity is the bigger factor by far here. It is almost zynic to turn it into ""women's liberation"" when what it really shows is that people are struggling much harder economically than they used to.<p>Liberation would be to give people a choice. In fact, if the women's jobs were so great, they would probably be able to afford a nanny? Certainly the ""academic women"" should be able to afford it (the ones who are most likely to want to work according to the article)? If it wasn't about money, perhaps the women could volunteer in a part time job while kids are at school to get their fulfilment? Honestly, I think that is a bit of bullshit - how many people really want to work, in non-creative professions?<p>I don't know how much a nanny costs, but as long as the women's job pays more than a nanny earns, they should be OK? Certainly the academic ones should earn more than an nanny. Also, nannys can be pooled (they can take care of several kids at the same time) - granted, might as well send the kids to school, but why should the tax payer have to pay?<p>I have grown up in Germany and still live here. Maybe I come from an atypical family, but so far I have not had the impression that ""Kids/Cooking/Church"" is what determines our lives. That is just sensationalist writing for the newspaper.<p>As for the game console, it seems to me that from a certain age, kids can entertain themselves. Why should they have to stick around at school all day passively digesting input? Probably kids have even more ideas on how to spend their time than adults. Obviously I would consider the game console to only be a last resort - probably still better for the kid's imagination than school, though. But as you said, if it is all just about ""locking up the kids"", why shouldn't the game console be adequate?<p>As it happens, I went to the public library a lot as a kid, as I also grew up without parents permanently being available. Just saying. I found my way to the library and back all by myself, too.",1263870392

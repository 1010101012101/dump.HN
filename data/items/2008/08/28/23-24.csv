Most of the people that were quoted were wrong (having class-based OO will impact performance on mobile devices?  what?).  Finally, the conclusion is wrong.  (I know I should expand on these points, but I think a quick read through will render that unnecessary :)<p>Personally, I would be happiest if all non-essential features were removed from the language and implemented as standard libraries.  Once you have a language with metaprogramming capabilities and an easy way to use libraries, you have every language feature you'll ever need.  The language would never need to be redesigned again; you could just load a library to get the feature of the day.<p>Unfortunately, it seems that language designers (and users) think that every feature needs its own special syntax, and that means we have to deal with bloated langauges like Javascript, ECMAScript 3.1, and ECMAScript 4 :)<p>(Yes, I think we should script web browsers with Lisp.  Why not?)",1219967629

I laugh at those millionaires who, as the article said, are squeaking by on 400k a year.  The biggest key to financial security isn't making more money.  It's reducing your living expenses.    If you're making 90k a year but socking away half of that, you're buying a year of retirement for every year you work.  (assuming your investments only keep you even with inflation and dont make you any additional money).<p>also: one of the best pieces of advice in the article is always have a mortgage.  as soon as you finish paying off your first house it's time to make a down payment on a new one and rent it out to pay for the mortgage.  assets>cash, plus it's tax advantaged.",1219964561

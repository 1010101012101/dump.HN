Hopefully it&#x27;ll generate productive discussion instead of a confused chorus attempting to clarify terminology.<p>> I feel there&#x27;s a panicked &quot;deer in the headlights&quot; attitude that comes with talking about data and metadata<p>Are you seeing that in this thread?  Or is this more of a generalized feeling of HN?  Or of the internet?<p>I feel like I&#x27;m mostly seeing discussions about what specific data was involved, what alternatives are out there, and the severity and history of the problem (which I&#x27;m seeing as mostly &quot;not as severe as your initial kneejerk to the title might imply, but not ideal either&quot; - pretty levelheaded and accurate, IMO?)<p>None of them seemed particularly frozen, unable to move forwards, or panicking beyond the time it took them to evaluate what specific (meta)data was leaking - to me, at least.  And given that password databases secure the keys to the castle, so to speak, I&#x27;m not sure a little panicking isn&#x27;t warranted in this specific context.<p>> I regularly forget about how closed-minded the HN userbase is when it comes to privacy.<p>If that&#x27;s in response to this thread, keep in mind that, in-context, the &quot;privacy&quot; many professionals in here are concerned about, is the &quot;privacy&quot; of their amazon account keys, to avoid their servers being subverted into part of a malware distribution botnet.  And the &quot;privacy&quot; of their user database - to avoid the reputation hit that comes when all your customer&#x27;s passwords are cracked, and their inboxes are flooded with porn spam.

The buffers are written to disk on checkpoint, but because they&#x27;re buffers, the potentially random writes are localized to a smaller number of nodes high in the tree, which minimizes the number of disk seeks required.  Since sequential I/O is cheaper than random, the sequential writes to the write-ahead log are very fast, so even in very strict durability configurations, TokuDB can easily outperform databases which use random writes to update the indexing structures, such as the B-trees used by InnoDB and most other RDBMSes.<p>More details here: <a href=""https://www.percona.com/blog/2011/09/22/write-optimization-myths-comparison-clarifications/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.percona.com/blog/2011/09/22/write-optimization-m...</a>",1445317788

There have been multiple articles written on how odd it is, and most companies tend to have multiple domain experts on the board. You won&#x27;t find many companies outside of the defense industry with 7/11 board members who are retired political and military leaders.<p>For an example of a normal board of directors just look at a competing company&#x27;s board--quest diagnostics--and notice the number of MDs, PhDs, financial experts, and CEOs of other companies, and the lack of former cabinet secretaries, senators, and retired generals. <a href=""http://ir.questdiagnostics.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=82068&p=irol-govboard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ir.questdiagnostics.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=82068&p=irol-...</a><p>>And you definitely can start taking upper level chemical engineering classes.<p>You can&#x27;t walk into Stanford and start taking junior and senior level chemical engineering classes as a freshmen, you would have a complete lack of prerequisite knowledge.<p>>It&#x27;s very common in college to ask to pass out of a requirement by taking the final.<p>It is not very common, in fact it&#x27;s pretty rare these days to find a department that will allow this.<p>Even if they did allow this, there are stacks of prerequisite chemistry, math, physics, and general engineering classes before a student can even touch classes in the chemical engineering department (other than special classes like freshmen seminars).",1445317584

Insulting someone who starting developing on PHP 5 not knowing about the short_tags() global function which only existed in PHP 3? Someone proficient in Visual Basic .NET but doesn&#x27;t know anything about VB 1-6? There is no reason to know how to develop in an ancient version of a language if every job you have had thus far has used exclusively modern versions.<p>Merely having been alive during the decade in which an obsolete technology was first introduced or was still popular means nothing. It may even have some relevance today when discussing the then-and-now similarities or differences, but frankly someone born decades after its obsolescence just will not care. There is already more knowledge than is possible to absorb about <i>current</i> technology. There is simply not enough time in a single lifetime to care about what came 20-40 years before.

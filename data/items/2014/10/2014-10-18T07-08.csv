It&#x27;s very likely that this is just a campaign to make the consumer trust these brands again because huge tech companies live (some maybe forced to live) in a symbiosis with government agencies. If the government doesn&#x27;t want tech companies to unite and turn against it, which still hasn&#x27;t happened yet and probably never will, then they must also give them something after/before they take something.",1413619087

After 15 minutes of HTML lesson, a newbie can already look at her creation in a browser and the html file on hard disk, and have fun tweaking it (<html><body background=&quot;green&quot;>My home page</body></html>, remember the days?). An hour of Java lesson can
result in several variations of &quot;Hello World!&quot;
programs, created by the student. Basically, people can put their hands on the knowledge and use it to produce somewhat useful/tangible stuff.<p>Not so much when learning music theory. After enduring the bombardment of names/concepts/terms/maths and other stuff for quite a while, I don&#x27;t have the slightest idea where I can practice in using them to analyze or write some music.<p>I wish there is a lecture in the format of &quot;One hundred songs for one hundred music concepts&quot;. The songs should be
stupidly simple (children&#x27;s songs, simple pops, short classical pieces, etc.). Each lesson concentrates on only _one_ concept appeared in the piece, explains what it is, how it is used, why it is used in that way, and how its application makes nice sound, etc. Basically, show me the _effect_ for each concept in a simple real world setting. Then more importantly, give me exercises to write a few bars of music using this concept, no matter how bad my writings are, as long as I am applying the new knowledge.",1413618917

Each step in this progression lowers the bar drastically for AI to start fulfilling peoples&#x27; social needs. We can now maintain or even establish a relationship with another human solely using text-based messaging, and I believe that soon we will reach the point where AIs can get 90% of the way there.

It is a large and well-researched academic discipline and there exists plenty of research regarding negative effects.  Here is a pretty decent summary, with a very compact abstract:<p>Bilingualism: The good, the bad, and the indifferent<p><a href=""http://www.yumingschool.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Bilingualism.-The-good-the-bad-and-the-indifferent.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yumingschool.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Bilin...</a><p>> The present paper summarizes research showing that bilingualism affects linguistic and cognitive performance across the
lifespan. The effect on linguistic performance is generally seen as a deficit in which bilingual children control a smaller
vocabulary than their monolingual peers and bilingual adults perform more poorly on rapid lexical retrieval tasks. The effect
on cognitive performance is to enhance executive functioning and to protect against the decline of executive control in aging.
These effects interact to produce a complex pattern regarding the effect of bilingualism on memory performance. Memory
tasks based primarily on verbal recall are performed more poorly by bilinguals but memory tasks based primarily on
executive control are performed better by bilinguals. Speculations regarding the mechanism responsible for these effects are described.",1413617123

I&#x27;m involved in a startup from the business, marketing, and front-end side and while I have a very deep and sincere respect for the time and mastery it takes to become a great engineer/developer, in my opinion there is much more to building a great product/company/startup (whichever word you prefer) than amazing tech.<p>pmarca expressed it well in a talk to Stanford&#x27;s MBA class in that he thinks the post-dot-com pendulum swung too far to the side of purely technical founders.

Maybe we&#x27;d <i>like</i> it if he did this, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to assume bad or even just &quot;ethically icky&quot; motives.<p>If all of twitpic&#x27;s data is exported or copied elsewhere, he can no longer effectively profit off of it. We don&#x27;t know that his intention is to just nuke the data and be done, he may be trying to salvage what he can monetarily (and the &quot;we&#x27;re getting acquired, just kidding&quot; thing is probably good evidence that something like this is going on behind the scenes).

Identify your MVP and some obvious desiderata, and then break it down brutally into small, small chunks. Build pieces each day, set cutoff points, and then troubleshoot for a little while at the end of every day over a beer on how to adjust for the day&#x27;s successes/failures with minimal changes to your overall schedule.<p>This is how it works in film production where I make my living and where a very high percentage of people also have ADD - it&#x27;s an asset in that context because you need to be able to focus on detail issues for many hours at a time, but also to be able to pivot rapidly in response to changing requirements of environmental constraints or unexpected problems.<p>Now it&#x27;s true that you can sit down with the idea to write some code and just start doing it. And I love to work that way on things a lot of the time. But it&#x27;s also a trap because without a Big Plan then you just end up bouncing around like a pinball between different problems. Now, the Big Plan is not that much fun because planning is actually kind of a tedious grind.<p>For a film you go through the script just doing a <i>ton</i> of data entry on every goddam thing that gets mentioned on the page, and adding in things that aren&#x27;t, eg if there&#x27;s a scene where a character is eating dinner you realize you have to make ten records for knives, forks, plates, napkins, wine glasses, bottles of wine, fruit juice to replace the actual wine, real food, fake food, yadda yadda yadda. The script here is analogous to your user experience map or functional specification or whatever you want to call it.<p>I have no idea what your product/service is but I assume that the more closely you try to document it the more the entries on your task list multiply...the header files, the libraries, the makefiles, the VCS, the blah blah blah. You&#x27;re sitting there thinking &#x27;damn, let me just write some code already, get something up and running here, when it gets a bit messy we&#x27;ll pause and sketch out the next stage...&#x27;. And of course you can, if you&#x27;re smart and creative - same way if you get a bunch of actors and creatives, a bunch of props, and a camera package, you can start shooting some fun sketch comedy or improvisational work...but you&#x27;ll very rapidly hit a wall in terms of the amount of complexity you can juggle on the fly. So to get anything done, you and your team sit there and plan, and plan, and plan. You pick tools, do some rough tests to see if those tools will hold up, and then design around them, but you also plan for a back up tool and plan for who to call if your toolchain collapses.<p>You sit there and plan and allocate time and argue about it, which is <i>intensely frustrating</i> because it&#x27;s not as much fun as actually doing it, and you work for days with no more output than an ever-expanding to-do list on an ugly spreadsheet/project management file. But the good part of this is that the structure of your project and your pain points gradually become clear before you start production work, and you go into that phase knowing what your priorities and constraints are. I can&#x27;t stress the importance of this enough, because when you run into problems, it&#x27;s that intimate knowledge of priorities and constraints that will help you to make decisions about when to press on, change tack or abandon something.",1413616847

</code></pre>
Some people took the advice to the extreme[1].<p>On the bright side though, the <i>Winner of the Challenge</i> was a startup called &#x27;Connected2Me&#x27; (IM mobile app) which was run by 2 guys: A Python developer (seemed to be the hardcore kind) and a DevOps guy who recently jumped up probably to handle the load and sys-admin. The startup had more than 2M users in Turkey alone. They both seemed (dress, talk, etc.) more like pure geeks more than business people.<p>[1] About a month ago I&#x27;ve seen a bio-informatics startup on HN (can&#x27;t recall if it was about fighting a disease e.g. HIV or about genetic modification). The <i>team</i> was made by 7 members, 6 business oriented people (CEO, CTO, this and that manager) and <i></i>ONE<i></i> biologist with IT background. Seemed extremely ridiculous!",1413616317

8474838,comment,8471786,8474553,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"Yes, <i>some people</i> can rent a truck (also, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s $20 in real life; probably $50 minimum, my real guess would be more like $70-$100 when all is said and done). You need any or all of a valid in-state driver&#x27;s license, your own insurance, a good idea that it&#x27;ll only take you an hour to find a good couch so that your money isn&#x27;t wasted on a truck rental and/or a hope that the garage sale that has a good, affordable couch will be willing to hold it until you get back with a truck, <i>and</i>, perhaps most significant, is that you need people to help you load and unload it. (Yes, yes, I know that in many parts of the country you can hire the Mexicans loitering in front of Home Depot for $5/head/hour, but that adds more expense and is possibly much riskier, since you&#x27;re letting those people know where you live, know that you live alone or at least don&#x27;t have sufficient help to move your own couch in,  and know what kind of stuff is in your dwelling space. The furniture store delivery guy learns all of this too, but he&#x27;s much better documented and therefore probably easier to track down if things go wrong.) You&#x27;d also have to hope that the couch remains in good condition for a reasonable length of time, whereas most RTO places will have some kind of recourse if you get a lemon.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s probably possible to get a couch without going through a RTO contract if you have the money to make RTO payments. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s reasonable, plausible, or even just worth all the extra effort. If you need a couch now and can pay it off a few payments down the road, it&#x27;s not so bad to be willing to pay a substantial expense for that convenience. As long as the consumer is informed, there&#x27;s no reason this voluntary trade of security/convenience for money shouldn&#x27;t be allowed or performed.<p>Of course it&#x27;d be cheaper if the consumer had access to cheaper credit, but they don&#x27;t, so these places have sprung up to help/serve those people. Again, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything inherently wrong with that. It&#x27;s just expensive (for both parties).",1413615907

As soon as you spot her (leaving it 10 mins will just look creepy :)) walk up to her and say ""hi, hows it going"" (her: ""hi, err fine""), ""what are you doing later?"" (her, probably: ""not much""), ""Do you want to come home with me?"".<p>Say it seriously (but not creepy serious) and lightly (dont laugh or smirk) as if you were asking about the weather. And then just wait (if she says ""what?"" just smile, it's crucial not to add anything else). Chances are she will say no (getting a slap is very unlikely). Whatever she says just carry on the conversation as if nothing ever happened (""cool, im justin. who are you?"" <i>offer hand to shake</i>, ""sweet - when did you get here?"" etc etc.). She might just walk off. If that happens just ignore her - chances are she will come back.<p>To ""win"" the challenge you have to buy her a drink (if you got up the balls to ask her this wont be even an issue).(warning buying the drink will more than likely put her off a bit).<p>(and, yes, I've done this - it's great if your feeling like a confidence boost! It works as a boost because there is no way they can say yes - so even a no is a result. Just asking the question is worth a million :))",1248259718

It's not an exclusive trait, and you can learn to play upon it and master it to some degree. For most people though, the creative act <i>doesn't do it for them</i> as it does for the creative person. And you can't learn to love something.<p>I consider myself a somewhat creative person. When I play the guitar for instance, making melodies and compositions is perhaps more a compulsive need than anything else. (I hope this doesn't come off as self glorification; but it's not all a good behavior either.) I've also had ambitions with art projects and forced myself to work, and conclusively shown myself that results never get as good as when you act spontaneously out of the joy and pleasure of creating, whatever big and strong visions.",1248258692

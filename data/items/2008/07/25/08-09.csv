256425,comment,256283,256283,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"GPS data is as close to ""free"" as you can get. It's a one-way satellite-to-earth transmission; bandwidth speeds are huge, and the size of the data transferred is minimal.<p>Consider the number of free satellite TV broadcasts. Take into account the sheer size of the hi-def audio/video feeds. Compare that to a latitude/longitude packet sent from a GPS satellite.... see what I mean?",1216976354

256415,comment,256176,256176,0,0,ars,,,"This lament applies to ALL the subjects in school, not just math. The problem is you just can't teach the joy of each one of these subjects to each of the students.<p>Some students will enjoy certain subjects and just 'get it'. But most won't, and I do not think there is any to teach it. You just can't.<p>So you teach what you can: at least they can read, even if they don't understand literature. Same for math: at least they can manipulate the symbols.<p>And the proof of the problem is the ""new math"". It tries very hard to do what he is saying and it's been a failure. At the end of it students don't know how to do math.<p>Except for those students who excel at math - but they would excel at it no matter how it was taught.",1216975291

Programming, systems administartion, writing processes for the software and reviewing architectural designs.<p>Everything I do pretty much falls into either software or electrical (hardware) engineering, at a higher or lower level depending on the job. I don't think of mechanical and structural engineers as having a monopoly on the term.",1216975191

256408,comment,254335,254335,0,0,connellybarnes,,,"With a typical salary at a typical programmer job, you can make enough money in every year to take several years time off.  But meanwhile, taking time off tends to cause isolation, depression, and other problems, since modern social interactions are based around work.  Making enough money to retire upfront seems needlessly suboptimal, as it makes it more difficult to do things, if you choose to avoid jobs thereafter.  If you choose to work at jobs afterward, then making the money upfront simply isn't necessary.<p>Of course in Ancient Greece it would be optimal to not have a job, but in America it's a liability.<p>I don't understand the get-rich-quick mentality for making startups.  It's illogical.  Making a startup to accomplish a meaningful goal is interesting, but money per se isn't.  Making lots of money to ""be free"" reduces to non-meaningful goals, no-goals centered around the rejection of much of what is worthwhile in life.  It's better for people to have real, tangible goals and pursue them, which nearly always leads to work, even if said people already have ""enough money.""<p>If one needs time to contemplate, sure, take a few years off.  But normally during such years, people who are healthy and challenging themselves will automatically start doing things interesting enough that they can convince someone to pay them for it.  If you can't do this, then you've essentially proved the irrelevance of your work (or that you need to go into academia, if your work is too theoretical to earn money in the ""normal"" world.)<p>A strong argument for making a startup is when you want to accomplish something so ambitious that no job would let you tackle that task, simply because jobs have smaller scope.<p>Maybe there are other good arguments for startups, but people are very unclear when they throw a bunch of confusing messages about money out there, because increasing income doesn't make people much happier [1], and it's easy for people who live in their means to take years off from jobs, if that's the issue at hand.<p>Even if you want to never work again, there's a greater probability of success in taking a high paying, dull job and working hard for several years, than working on a startup.  But many ambitious people would have a lot less pride in doing this, despite the higher probability of success.  Again this indicates that startups are really about pride of ownership, pride of tackling new ideas, changing the world, etc, than money.<p>[1]. <a href=""http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S15/15/09S18/index.xml?section=topstories"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S15/15/09S18/inde...</a>",1216975002

We are now in the process of having every language verified.\nWe've added info about the word type - noun, verb etc. Likewise, gender.\nWe've added the speaking teacher to say the word, plus there is a facility for native speakers and learners to make recordings of their daily words - this is particularly important for languages where a text to speech engine is not available, such as Welsh or Hindi.\nImmersion is the best way to learn a language, but having a bank of 1000 words to pull from really helps comprehension in the early days. \nLook out for our new release on the 1st August.\nMany thanks for your feedback,\nNicola",1216973830
256406,comment,255587,256239,0,0,sutro,,,"To me, ""engineer"" and ""architect"" are terms originally pulled from other disciplines -- perhaps as an attempt to lend credence to the seemingly less substantial act of mere ""programming."" John Carmack and id software, to me, represent the disavowal of all pretense, the refusal to seek the respectability of more historically established fields. They are programmers and they are proud.",1216973772

Since not many sites use a blatantly impossible color scheme (truth be told the last time I've been told by a colorblind friend that there was a problem was back when Apple used red and green dots for iPhone availability (2g, not 3g), now Apple's using shapes and colors), I'd say the bigger accessibility travesty I can think of now are sites that use image-based captchas with no alternatives (audio, answer a question, etc.). Grrrr.<p>Not to say I don't think much of colorblindness (I still test for that on the sites I work on, there are some excellent tools around for that purpose), and not to say that I love spam, but I hate those particular types of captchas.",1216973070

It might not be incontrovertible truth, but I do think that our current military industrial complex is mostly irrational and detrimental.

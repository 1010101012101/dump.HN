It would be an application of the ""Gilette model"" of sales -- sell the razor, or the printer, or the video-game console cheap, and make your money back on selling blades, cartridges, or cartridges respectively.<p>For a book-delivery platform like the Kindle, this strikes me as a natural model -- a user is likely to buy a large number of books over his lifetime, and the margin of profit on a $10 e-book makes the margin of profit on a music CD look humble.<p>There's also the point that the Kindle is not an obviously useful sort of device.

Anything less, and we can do no more than expect similar bad decisions -- from those same people -- in the future.""<p>I'm not looking to defend Google's choices about Buzz. But I take exception to the idea of firing people who make bad decisions without due consideration for how those decisions came about.<p>It flies in the face of a mantra at HN: Fail early and often.  It goes against the idea that you learn by making mistakes.<p>If a company fires people for making a poor decision out of ignorance, then they have just lost someone with valuable experience about a potentially troublesome choice.  Now that company has to go get someone who (most likely) has not fucked up in that way.  (I bet most places do not hire people who  got fired from another job for fucking up.)<p>Who is more likely to make that same or a similar mistake in the future?  The person who already fucked up and learned something, or the new person without that experience?<p>Some people screw up because they are innately incompetent in some field.  Let them go; they will not get any better.<p>Others screw up because they are doing something new, or acting with incomplete or wrong information.  In that case, the problem may not be the person but the situation.<p>Fix the conditions, don't just find a scapegoat.",1265991623

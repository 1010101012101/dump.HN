As of now, the iPhone is quickly becoming the Windows of the mobile phone world in that application developers are dedicating their time and energy into developing for the iPhone with other platforms being an afterthought (if at all).<p>Not that I don't love Apple, but due to a large family plan I can't switch carriers.  Plus, it's always good when multiple companies can compete effectively.  As a long time Mac user - back from the days before the Mac was cool again - I remember how hard it was to get good quality apps.  The web, becoming more and more of a platform, and Apple's return to prosperity changed that.<p>Maybe I'm just being a worrier (it's been known to happen), but I'd like to see another platform drum up the developer community that the iPhone has.  I'd rather that the mobile space had better competition than the desktop space did, say, 9 years ago.",1243486658

Despite efforts to edit electronically, he relented to five rounds of fedex'd doorstops.  He offered to generate the Kindle edition himself, but this was deemed contractually impossible.<p>These companies have to be culled to get to our veritable library of ebooks.  But in the meantime, I imagine Amazon has been kicking lots of asses to get this far.",1243486579

629790,comment,628670,629502,0,0,stcredzero,,,"I never commented in support of ""intrinsic value.""  Specifically, the ""market value"" of legal tender is arguably problematic.  There are well established instruments that can be used to determine the market values of things like cars and electricity and the metals in coins.  However, ""legal tender"" status has a clear precedent for confounding this.  A penny is a penny, and an employer who pays with older coins whose copper and nickel content is worth more than their face value wouldn't be liable for additional tax.",1243486473

629788,comment,629707,629764,0,0,jamroom,,,"I agree with the parent - the one thing the iPhone has going for it is a _consistent_ platform, which allows developers to design the user experience around a hardware set that is pretty much standardized.  I highly doubt the 18 phones that Android will be on come year end will all have standardized on things like screen resolution, touch features, hard/soft keyboard, etc, and so we'll see a fractured user (and developer) experience.  I'm certain that Android will be a wild success, much like other mobile phone OS's before the iPhone were successful, but I don't think it will take off like the iPhone has.<p>The comparison to trying to be the ""windows"" of the mobile phone was right on (in my opinion).",1243486273

You may find that new gold accounts for a fantastically small percentage of the total.  Compare this, on the other hand, with paper.  How easy is it to double the money supply or more in a very short period.  There simply is no way to underestimate the stability you get with a gold standard.

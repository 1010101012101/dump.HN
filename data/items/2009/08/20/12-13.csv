Flights are almost never cancelled except due to mechanical failure, crew fatigue, or inclement weather. The reason being, that same plane taking you from NYC to SFO is also the plane that 130 people are waiting for in SFO to SEA. So, whether it is 100% full or only has 2 people, it still makes the trip. Have you ever been on a plane with only 2 passengers aboard? I have - and you can pick any seat you want! They will even send an empty plane out (with crew, of course).<p><i>C) raise the prices of refundable tickets so high that you will go to another carrier at the outset.</i><p>Refundable tickets are already that high - almost nobody buys them. They are already 3-5x as high as your average discount ticket and almost solely purchased by business travellers or foreigners who need that flexibility. The 99% of cow-herded casual travellers buy the bottom-of-the-barrel discount tickets, usually from Travelocity and the like, with the most restrictions. Unfortunately, I don't see that changing unless there is a massive uprooting of the current airline industry.",1250772934

The implementation is the hard part.<p>Furthermore, it is very hard to actually know which ideas are good until implemented, and even with truly great ideas a bad implementation will destroy them while a good implementation can make a mediocre idea successful.<p>I hesitate to suggest this, but if the ideas are truly original and tie into some concrete product or business product then you could try patenting them.  Doing this will require you to invest some real time and money, but nowhere near as much as implementation.  That patent would then have some value to a startup looking to implement an idea similar to that so you would be bringing something to the table if trying to join that startup or you could try selling it outright to the startup.<p>I certainly would never recommend becoming a patent troll, but holding a relevant patent does give you something to bring to the table while you work out a niche for yourself with the founders (perhaps in marketing and fund raising or handling some of the other business aspects or else learning enough to help with implementation.)

Elaborate plans are brittle because there are many dependencies interwoven into them.  Another way of putting that is that there are a lot of implicit assumptions about how the final system will work.  But the reality is that there are things that will be unanticipated developments during the actual construction.  Some of these will be things that in hindsight should have been anticipated, and others will be things that it really isn't possible to anticipate.  In other words, we only really learn what the plan should look like by building.<p>Building gives us crucial elements of the plan.  But there is another essential piece as well.  And that is that one person can only figure out so much of how something complicated enough to be valuable should work.  This is part of why YC wants multiple co-founders rather than single founders.  It's also where you want to get feedback loops working in your favor.  So much of life is about feedback loops, whether it is body temperature, or social confidence, or addictive dependencies.

(Ebay : let's put an auction on the web, YouTube : Let's make it easy to post videos, facebook : let's do 'classmates' but much better).

Flash performance certainly depends upon the CPU class, just like anything else -- it'll perform differently on a modern desktop vs modern laptop vs smartphone, but with canvas you have that worry as well and then you have to multiply it by how much variance there is in performance across all the browsers.<p>Of course, the flip side of that is that sometimes there just isn't Flash at all on a particular platform, so it will be nice when canvas is mature enough that it is just taken for granted that the performance is pretty good for whatever platform it is currently running on, but we certainly aren't there yet.",1319924824

Technically, I was an independent contractor.  Therefore, they had no legal responsibility to me.  Of course, I was entirely responsible to them, and I wasn't allowed to run my route like a proper business (e.g. no payment for three days, cut them off).  Basically, it was training for being taken advantage of by large(r) corporations.<p>Nowadays, it looks like all the paper delivery around here is done by adults.  One drives while the other walks and tosses papers at 3am.  Better experience for the customer, billing is automated, and no kids are exploited.  A loss of an American tradition, perhaps, but a tradition which became a mild form of exploitation rather than empowerment.<p>Incidentally, on the subject of machinery, tasks should be relegated by age.  A twelve year old is <i>probably</i> capable of handling basic lawn machinery, though 14 or 16 is probably better.  An eight year old can certainly rake leaves, dig holes, and trim bushes.  A four year old can rake leaves and move rocks.  I did lawn work for my grandparents every summer and, despite being disallowed the riding lawnmower, I was reasonably effective.<p>Another point I'll make is that both lemonade stands and paper routes are basically dead-end.  You can't franchise a lemonade stand.  As a paperboy, you can conceivably upgrade to a scooter to cover more distance, but you're still stuck personally collecting money from all the deadbeats.  It's really just wage-labor under an entrepreneurial fog.",1319924684

3172878,comment,3171778,3172675,4,0,Chris_Newton,,,"> Curiously there aren't a lot of DOD discussions or articles on HN.<p>How much is there to say, really, once you've got the basic idea?<p>OOP has always emphasized single objects. Part of that emphasis is that data is grouped by object rather than by field.<p>For some applications, this style can work well. GUIs are the canonical example.<p>However, if speed really matters, a focus on individual objects is rarely helpful, because it doesn't support typical data access patterns where algorithms probably want to work with one field for many objects rather than many fields for the same object.<p>This doesn't just matter for games. If you're working on any kind of mathematical code using large matrices, something as simple as choosing row-major vs. column-major ordering appropriately can make a very noticeable difference to performance on modern hardware with several layers of cache.<p>One of the nicer things about C++ is that while it supports OOP (at least in the variation that has become most popular) it doesn't try to shoe-horn everything into being an object and is quite happy for you to worry about your own memory layouts if you want to.<p>Once you've understood that basic point, there isn't really much else to know about Data Oriented Design. It seems like one of those ideas that has been capitalised to make it seem more important than it really is. If no-one had popularised OOP, despite its fundamental flaws in this respect, perhaps we would have just called the DOD approach ""common sense""...",1319924370

Dart doesn't require enough type information to allow the compiler to guarantee that code that passes the type checker won't throw a runtime exception.

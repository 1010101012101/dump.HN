He certainly isn't worried about redistribution of power.<p>I don't think he'd argue that any citizen should have the power of a police officer to arrest someone. That could involve a great deal of violence, and officers are trained for those situations.<p>His point is more that given existing asymmetry in power, symmetric exposure of information is not equivalent.<p>You can find out about a cop arresting you. The Cop can find out about you. But the cop can do so much more with that information, and can do it faster.<p>He often has argued for the inherent benefit of privacy.",1204998361

I'm like that myself, I've done a 36 hour 'shift' before because I was on the damn biggest idea of my life -- so much so, I did 1,000% work and it was to my usual standard, if not higher, for quality. If I do one of these days in two working weeks (10 days) then who cares if I produce less work on a day to day basis, as long as my average productivity is equal or higher than the rest?<p>Some days I blatently just don't work, creativity hits me when I'm doing something different. If I'm focused too much on a task, it's like I inhibit my mind from processing it in different ways. It's like pushing a rock up a hill, if you just keep trying you never think that pushing it in a spiral is much less effort and faster than killing yourself taking the direct route and getting nowhere.<p>Hackers should know this lesson as it takes creativity. The unconventional way is what everyone here should be interested in, otherwise it wouldn't need hackers; would it?",1204997965

But <argument from authority> PG says smart people don't think they're smart, they just can't understand how dumb everyone else is</ argument from authority>.  This doesn't mean they go around telling people they suck, but that's generally the attitude at Hacker News.  You often hear about criteria being about whether something sucks or doesn't suck.<p>Also, being pretty good implies being better than others.  Whether you praise yourself or dis others, you're still saying you're at a high percentile.  Being good or sucky is relative.",1204997725

132024,comment,131926,131926,0,0,rksprst,,,"My startup (not launched yet) is a dating site and one of the features we have is showing the response rate of the users (with some tweaks that solve the problems that I talk about in the next sentence). However, you need to be careful in how you present this data to the user. Because even if a girl's response rate is only 20% it might simply be that she's attractive and has gotten all the guys to contact her and she just can't respond back. So the response rate is not a really accurate way of telling the user ""you have a 20% chance of getting a response"".<p>By asking the user for criteria and then saying ""20% of users that met her/his criteria received a response"" is not a good idea. A lot of users of online dating sites are frustrated with the perfection that they need to achieve. Not everyone can be perfect and fit your criteria, and just because the user doesn't fit the criteria doesn't mean that they can't be a perfect match for the user.",1204997558

132021,comment,131691,131691,0,0,giardini,,,"Knew a developer who solved problems by modifying code until it worked: a veritable one-man GA (Genetic Algorithm) poor at math but able to sling code 24x7. He worked atrocious hours. Usually he got something close enough to correct for others not to notice. The bosses admired his ""work ethic"". Last I heard he was an officer in a VC firm, on his third marriage, in failing health and still working round the clock. He asked the same of his developers which led to hi turnover.<p>I know another developer: after analysis he could predict time-to-completion within days; he was always correct; his code was always perfect and well-documented; he didn't pad his work: nobody else could do equivalent work in the same time. He's worth 10 of the GA-type developer. Today he remains a developer; he's in good health, happily married and hasn't worked over 45 hours a week in the last 10 years. He's very well-paid.<p>Life's like that: incompetents often succeed (after a fashion) but few are lucky enough to depart the game unscathed.

132007,comment,131942,131984,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"You know, I'm starting to think there's no intrinsic difference between self-confidence and arrogance.  Both arrogance and self-confidence amount to having balls and the willingness to piss people off because you don't care what they think.  Whether you were self-confident or arrogant comes down to whether you used good means to achieve a good end.  This replaces the self-confident/arrogant dichotomy with the more familiar good/bad dichotomy.<p>Then, a lot of people are selfish.  If you are doing something they don't like, they'll say you're bad, and if you help them out, they'll say you're good.<p>My (probably inaccurate) conclusion is the people you piss off will say you're arrogant, and the people that you helped out will say you're self-confident.<p>Nota bene:  this is all pretty tentative.

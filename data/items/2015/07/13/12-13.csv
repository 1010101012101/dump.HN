GDP vs spending implies that spending hasn&#x27;t dropped, when in fact it&#x27;s actually dropped by something like 30% since 2008.  The fact that the economy has also contracted drastically in that time doesn&#x27;t mean spending wasn&#x27;t cut.<p>> <i>Second, the graph you linked shows similar level of spending as 2001 and I am not aware of any austerity claims during that year in Greece.</i><p>I&#x27;m at a loss for words here.

Do it quickly. Tell them right away that they have been made redundant, and that it is non-negotiable. Let them know that it is not of any fault of their own, and that they will be allowed to interview whenever they please. Being made redundant sucks, not just because you&#x27;re out of a job, but because you often feel that if you were better at your job the company wouldn&#x27;t have had to make cutbacks.<p>2. If you make someone redundant during work hours, make sure they leave the office at the end of the day. I&#x27;ve worked in companies where employees were made redundant at around 2-3pm and then asked to return to their desk to carry on work. This was a huge problem for everyone in the office, as that person was still working to a deadline, and was asked by the manager to (paraphrasing) &quot;stop moping, and get on with your work&quot;.<p>3.

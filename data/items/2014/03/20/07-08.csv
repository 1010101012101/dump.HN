I&#x27;m running three multiplayer games for about two years now, and it starts to have problems once if goes over 3500 concurrent connections. It could be that I just hit the right combination of node+socketio versions, though, as I had problems with newer ones. My setup is:<p>node.js 0.6\nsocket.io 0.9.6<p>This version of socket.io has a nasty bug in jsonp protocol handling which I patched manually by merging some change from a newer version, but it does work fine.<p>To make it scale, I run multiple node processes. In the last 300+ days each of those has between 1000 and 2000 concurrent connections all the time and it works fine. Except that there is some memory leak (I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s related to socket.io or some other lib), so I restart each server once a week (it&#x27;s done automatically each Sunday at 2am).<p>I had my eye on SockJS since 2012, and it looks like newer versions are really good, but I&#x27;d need upgrade to newer nodejs and this is simply not possible for the existing projects as many used modules are not available.<p>However, if you&#x27;re starting a new project, it&#x27;s worth testing and see which performs better.",1395301794

Edison and not many people can relate to that any more.<p>This is what has been on my mind for a couple hours now,\nsince I first got the &quot;RFS&quot; in my email.\nI just subscribed to the Sam Altman blog not that long ago because\nI ran into some material of his which was inspiring.<p>I&#x27;m not a social networker or a software engineer, and I&#x27;m not from a silicon valley industry,\nso I&#x27;ve been trying to get realistic ideas how these kinds of companies get\noff to such a good start with their capital.\nNow all of a sudden horizons here have broadened to include natural science,\nthis is even more inspiring.<p>I would expect some people would figure I&#x27;m too old for this ycombinator\ntype stuff, but here I am now.",1395301521

Some of them weren&#x27;t that successful (Kiko) but still sold for a small profit.<p>Twitch / Justin.tv is a 120+ employee company that makes money and supports over 100 full time broadcasters who make their living on our platform (and has hundreds of thousands of casual broadcasters). Over 45 million people look at Twitch videos every month. While there are many more successful companies, I don&#x27;t think you could call that a failure.<p>Socialcam was a spinoff of Justin.tv that was acquired for $60m on less than $2m raised capital.<p>The jury is still out on the Exec / Handybook acquisition, but I think the online-to-offline home services space is a growth space.<p>I think I&#x27;ve earned a few investors&#x27; trust and I think I have some experience with founding early stage tech companies.",1395299667

There is also no history (AFAIK) of prosecution, of serious prosecution which takes the effort to follow up on  stolen coins may have been &quot;mixed&quot; etc., in cases of BTC theft.<p>Given this, does not an online service (like Coinbase) which holds a large amount of bitcoin in &quot;stealable&quot; form present, to potential criminals, a lot of incentive to break in and take it all away? I, for one, wouldn&#x27;t keep up to 5000 USD in such a place, at least till the time there has been some serious prosecution and proportionate sentencing of BTC thieves.

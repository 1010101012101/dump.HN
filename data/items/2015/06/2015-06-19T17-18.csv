9746521,comment,9739170,9744330,0,0,dalke,,,"Let us suppose that it is possible to &quot;petition the Lord with prayer&quot;, to quote Morrison. For example, do prayers from strangers help someone recover from an illness?<p>We can test two populations, ones who receive stranger prayer, and ones who do not, and see if one population gets better treatment. We can look at the epidemiology to see if people from one religion, who practice healing prayer, have different health outcomes than those who do not. (This is tricky but not intractable because there is more than one factor at play.)<p>Thus we have the ability to <i>detect</i> if there is something outside of the current model. Detecting failures of the current model is part of science, even when it it cannot produce a better model other than &quot;here there be dragons.&quot; What&#x27;s at issue is that so far those gaps seem to get smaller and smaller the more we look into them. Hence the phrase &quot;God of the gaps.&quot;<p>We of course have many examples of thing which were outside of the then-current understanding of science. The &quot;ultraviolet catastrophe&quot; is a classic example. The irreconcilability of general relativity and quantum mechanics is another.<p>But we did not call that &quot;supernatural&quot;, even though when we knew there was a gap in our understanding.<p>At this point, global flooding of the sort discussed would have to be a supernatural event. There is no place for the water to come from or go to. There is no physical trace of such an event. Therefore, it would either require planetary engineering of the sort more appropriate for science fiction, or some sort of magical or divine intervention.",1434736727

We sometimes perform lots of other things like static analysis that get in the way of a rapid feedback loop. We also run mutation testing, which can sometimes take several hours for the whole codebase -- although we don&#x27;t have this run on every commit, just ones that we merge into a specific branch.<p>The problem I have with non-linear commit history is that I find it impossible to keep all the paths straight in my head when I am trying to understand a series of changes.

It is only acceptable because Uber argued that it was necessary to get drivers on the streets. If Uber starts setting shifts, then it looks to the consumer like pure greed. A probable outcome is regulation to cap fares. The main reason to set shifts is to maximize asset utilization, but Uber doesn&#x27;t own the assets (vehicles), so this isn&#x27;t an issue.",1434736701

Seems like yes based on screenshots so this might be something I’ll try again later.<p>The web version…felt inefficient. Let’s start at the beginning. The first you show me is this:<p><a href=""http://cl.ly/image/260C102g1i3z"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/image/260C102g1i3z</a><p>Most people are not going to read this. In that second sentence you basically tell me what I’m going to need to do…but that’s not the kind of sentence I could ever memorize and so the MOMENT I closed it, I already forgot what the first step if that was your intention to make it feel easier.<p>Part of the reason I can’t remember that first instruction you gave me is because normal people don’t talk/think in weird lists. It also doesn’t help that it doesn’t have a nice parallel structure to it. Rhythm and repetition helps a lot.<p><a href=""https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/623/01/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/623/01/</a><p>If it were me, I’d just get rid of it. If the first step is for me to create a group. Start me with creating a group. Hopefully, I got to this step because I understood along the way that this will help me create carpools.<p>When I closed that dialog…the next thing I did was look at this:<p><a href=""http://cl.ly/image/1r3Q3d3H0C0X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/image/1r3Q3d3H0C0X</a><p>I would totally remove those ads…or at least don’t show me them until I learn how to use your UX. They immediately caught my eye and attention and proceeded to also write over your first instructions. At this point, I’d optimize for people getting through your flow.<p>So this page is both distracting with the ads and the call to action isn’t super clear. I’m looking right at the biggest thing on your page which is very light gray and barely legible because it’s light gray on white text. THAT is where a giant Add Group button should be. Again, I wouldn’t start here. If I have no groups or carpools setup, just start me on the first step.<p>Which you have me do in a series of modals, not my favorite, but okay.<p><a href=""http://cl.ly/image/3H2u250p0W0G"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/image/3H2u250p0W0G</a><p>Studies show that people don’t have problems going through multiple step processes…as long as they understand they’re making progress and that you sign post it for them. It would be nice if you let me know the total number of steps.<p>Also, I couldn’t abandon this once I started. Remember, the first time users probably try out a new piece of software…they’re basically kicking the tires. Let them move around and get a feel for it. The reason I wanted to back out was because your app is still a stranger to me and the first thing you want me to do is add my friends and their contact info to your system. You actually WON’t let me move forward with just my name…and so now I’m thinking…shit…is this thing going to spam my friends? What if this isn’t good? I can’t take that chance…etc. Don’t trap me, bro.<p>When I get to step 3, I get totally confused.
<a href=""http://cl.ly/image/2j3T1P0a2I0o"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/image/2j3T1P0a2I0o</a><p>This is partially because I do it to myself. When you asked me to create a group, you forced me to write a description for the group, which seemed unnecessary. So I just wrote “why” to get through it. 
<a href=""http://cl.ly/image/0r1F080q0H0b"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/image/0r1F080q0H0b</a><p>In the add driver/rider flow, which looks very similar to this define routes flow…I’ve mentally mapped this type of interface (rows with text inputs underneath) to adding items…but you have this setup working to update an existing location. Also in the previous steps you made me even add myself as a rider and so it feels weird and jarring that you have pre-picked places for me for my convenience for this step. It’s the only place you do it!<p>Anyway, this is a long way of telling you that I hesitated typing anything in here because I was trying to change the locations by clicking on them…I didn’t realize just filling out those inputs would replace them.  That’s power law of practice for you. It works that quickly.<p>When I finally finish…I don’t realize that I need to do one last step:
<a href=""http://cl.ly/image/0V2I1D0f0j0i"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/image/0V2I1D0f0j0i</a><p>Overall, I’d say the problems with your flow are clearly posting calls to actions on the page…meaning make it obvious that when I look at the interface that I know clearly what I should click on next. It also feels like I’m clicking forever to do this task. I’d ask yourself some hard questions about what is the minimum actually needed to get a carpool up and going.<p>If it were me, I’d just ask for where is the ultimate destination, maybe a date and a list of emails. Then I’d push it out for everyone else to fill things out. Their contact and locations and ask if they want to volunteer to drive. If it goes well, ask if they want to reschedule it again or make it recurring. To make people feel comfortable sending this out to friends, have one already built that shows off the features that they can play with.<p>Whew…alright. I know this is a lot of feedback, but that doesn’t mean I thought it was terrible. Keep editing / whittling this flow down and you’ll get to something tight. If I have time, I’ll play around with this on my phone later. Thanks for sharing!",1434736374

If everyone buys into the concept that &quot;git commits&quot; are just another lightweight form of &quot;Ctrl+S&quot;, we would <i>expect</i> for programmers&#x27; <i>private</i> branches to sometimes have broken builds.  That&#x27;s the nature of real-world work such as refactoring or experimental changes.  There&#x27;s no social penalty or stigma for broken builds in <i>private</i> repos.  Therefore, if a programmer rewrites history to hide broken builds, it&#x27;s not because of ego or image-consciousness but because of consideration for others to read a comprehensible story of the changes.<p><i>You made a commit that broke the build? Well, try not to do that, but as long as you don&#x27;t push it, it&#x27;s not a big deal. Fix it (in a new commit!) and you&#x27;ll push both of them together. History is preserved, nobody&#x27;s build actually broke, everybody&#x27;s happy.</i><p>Not everybody&#x27;s happy.  If we conceptually treat git commits as a 2nd form of &quot;ctrl+s&quot;, we <i>don&#x27;t want</i> to see both commits.  Instead, clean up your private history, then craft/squash/edit your commits into a logical story, then make sure your public history has a clean build, and then apply those commits to the public branch.  That&#x27;s the way Linus Torvalds likes it for Linux patches and many agree with him.  We do want some history to be preserved but not <i>all</i> of it.",1434736133

Sit close to your monitor, close enough that text isn&#x27;t crisp enough. Now zoom your display (Ctrl+&#x27;+&#x27; in most browsers), which is equivalent to bringing a virtual display closer. Note that the text still isn&#x27;t crisp. If you could see the pixelation before, you can still see it. Moving the virtual display closer does nothing, because you aren&#x27;t adding more resolution to the physical display.<p>Your analogy is backwards and doesn&#x27;t apply.<p>But sticking to that same analogy, go get 1080p resolution image. View it on a 1080p display. You&#x27;re seeing 1:1 (100%) of the detail within the image (all of it). Now zoom out, and again, and again. Detail has been lost. First a little, then a lot, and as you go too far back substantial amounts have been. This is because a 1080p image on a 1080p display can only display 100% of the detail when it is viewed at 100%. As the image is zoomed (or further away in the VR headset&#x27;s case) it is not possible to continue to consume all of the details as the pixels don&#x27;t physically exist to display it.<p>So solve this problem you need a higher resolution than the source material, and it gets higher and higher the more you zoom. If you viewed a 1080p image on a 8640p display, you could zoom out significantly with absolutely no loss of detail, because the pixel density is such that it can still render every dot within the image.<p>So in order for a VR headset to be able to render stuff far away with no loss of detail the resolution of the headset has to be much higher than the source video. The further away the video gets, the higher the resolution. Again, that is if you want absolutely no loss of detail (in the real world, some loss of detail is acceptable).<p>In order to play back a 1080p video on a 1080p VR headset, the video either needs to be right in front of the viewer (at 1:1), you&#x27;ll have to accept loss of detail when moving it further away, or you&#x27;ll need a higher resolution on the VR headset than the source video (e.g. 4x more pixels on the headset than the source video, when it only takes up 1/4th of the VR headset&#x27;s display space).<p>If the virtual display-video is only 1cm squared on each of the VR headset&#x27;s displays, then that 1cm needs to have the same pixels as 1080p to display 1080p video with no loss of detail. It is just physics. As you move things further away in virtual reality they get rendered by fewer pixels on the real-world VR headset displays, and therefore loss of detail is unavoidable. You can only counteract this with higher PPI than the source video (or just accepting the loss of detail).",1434735753

And there&#x27;s never been that much movement bar minor bugfixes for a long time. Not that there necessarily needs to be, it does what it does, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any movement toward integrating closely with Adobe vector products (which would be useful) or seriously optimising (like, say, Greensock&#x27;s really nice SVG animation stuff that&#x27;s come out recently). Also IMO the two main competitors are better (SVG.js for simplicity & very nice plugins, Paper.js for complex stuff with amazing documentation). Note Paper.js is the successor to the Illustrator plugin Scriptographer, which was fantastic, but was killed by Adobe Illustrator updates - Adobe had something they could have used that worked really, really well, but didn&#x27;t back it.<p>Snap is good, and useful, but it&#x27;s not <i>that</i> useful, it&#x27;s just a tiny library, and a bit of a wasted opportunity IMO. With fairly crap documentation beyond the basics.

9746279,comment,9743689,9743689,0,0,tomstokes,,,"This is a good study, but it&#x27;s important to understand that the study results [1] don&#x27;t really contradict much of our current understanding of serotonin-related antidepressant activity. If you read through the actual study, you&#x27;ll see that the authors aren&#x27;t disagreeing with SSRI activity but rather attempting to gather more insight into the accepted anxiolytic activity of SSRIs.<p>Neurotransmitter reductionism is one of the more difficult pop-neuropsychiatry concepts to shake, because it&#x27;s so tempting to think of neurotransmitters like serotonin in the same way we&#x27;ve come to think of more basic biomarkers like cholesterol levels or other hormone levels. Neurotransmitter function is several orders of magnitude more complex, and can&#x27;t simply be summarized as &quot;too much&quot; or &quot;too little.&quot;<p>For example, neurotransmitter signaling is often divided in to two components: Tonic and phasic release. Tonic signaling is lower frequency (think closer to DC current for a very crude analogy), while phasic release is higher frequency (think more along the lines of AC current). The balance of tonic vs phasic signaling often has a massive influence on the actual outcome of the signaling. SSRIs are frequently (and wrongly) thought of as generically &quot;increasing serotonin levels&quot; when what they&#x27;re really doing is altering serotonin dynamics in the synaptic cleft. Inhibiting the serotonin reuptake pump causes the serotonin to stick around longer in the synaptic cleft, which (again, roughly speaking) slows the serotonin dynamics down a bit and moves toward tonic, rather than phasic, signaling. It&#x27;s not difficult to find studies showing relationships between serotonin tonic and phasic signaling, SSRIs, and stress adaptation differences. See [2] for the first example I found in a quick search.<p>Another very important component of serotonin signaling are 5-HT1A autoreceptors located on presynaptic terminals. These are part of the feedback loop regulating serotonin release. Briefly, 5-HT1A autoreceptors bind serotonin in the synaptic cleft and apply negative feedback to serotonin release. More serotonin in the synaptic cleft results in more 5-HT1A autoreceptor activation, which will in turn slow serotonin release. SSRIs will increase extracellular serotonin area under the curve, which will result in additional 5-HT1A activation and altered serotonin release dynamics. This system will ultimately re-regulate to some other set-point after several weeks, which is theorized to be part of the reason for the therapeutic lag in SSRI treatment, and also thought to explain why SSRIs often initially cause more anxiety by acutely increasing serotonin levels before the system re-regulates. 5-HT1A autoreceptor modulation is also the theorized mechanism of action of anti-anxiety medications like Buspirone, and 5-HT1A modulation is a property of two of the most recent anti-depressant medications Vortioxetine and Vilazadone.<p>This is another good study to have, but it&#x27;s important to not be too quick to think that this contradicts our current understandings.<p>[1] <a href=""http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2319711"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=23197...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22791197"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22791197</a>",1434734455

The widespread presence of basic methodological flaws in many scientific papers such as misunderstanding the meaning of p values means a lot of so-called science is built on faulty reasoning. This is worse than merely presenting a model that imperfectly represents the data, it is simply wrong: reaching conclusions that the data do not justify and never could.<p>You see this most often with efforts to reduce complex systems down to the effect of single variables; such efforts are almost guaranteed to miss the point.

The dynamics (both social & personal) for commits are different.<p>My guess is that you understand Git commands but you&#x27;re using the SVN/CVS mental model of treating commits as &quot;sacred&quot; markers.  If someone commits in those older centralized systems, they could potentially break the build and stop the team&#x27;s productivity.  This leads to strange social dynamics such as programmers &quot;hoarding&quot; their accumulation of code changes over days/weeks and then they later end up in &quot;merge hell&quot;.<p>Because Git &quot;commits&quot; have a <i>private</i>-then-public phase, the programmer does not have to be burdened with affecting others&#x27; productivity with their (sometimes spurious) commits.     They can have twitchy trigger fingers with repeated &quot;git commit&quot;.  The git commits can be treated as a personal redundant backup of Ctrl+S (or vi &quot;:w&quot;).  (Or as others stated, the git commits and <i>private history</i> become an extension of their text editors.)  They don&#x27;t have to hoard their code changes.  Because of the different dynamics, they don&#x27;t necessarily have an automated Continuous-Integration complete rebuild of the entire project triggered with <i>every</i> commit.  To outsiders however, many of these commits are just &quot;noise&quot; and don&#x27;t rise to the same semantic importance that we associated with CVS/SVN type of commits.<p>In this sense, &quot;rebase rewriting private history&quot; does not mean faking accounting numbers like &quot;Enron fraud&quot; and throwing auditors off track, but instead, it&#x27;s more like &quot;hit backspace key or Ctrl+Z and type the intended characters.&quot;<p>In CVS/SVN, the &quot;commits&quot; are a Really Big Deal.<p>However, in Git, the &quot;commits&quot; are Not a big deal and closer in concept to a redundant &quot;Ctrl+S&quot;.

I&#x27;ll jump in here with a response to one part of your comment near the end.<p><i>All Chinese speakers read the same script even if their spoken language is quite different.</i><p>That&#x27;s an oversimplification. Chinese speakers who have not learned to read of course don&#x27;t read any script. And in actual current usage, written Chinese is conformed to the speech patterns of the national standard language, Mandarin, and reflects the vocabulary and grammatical patterns of that language. Chinese characters still represent SPEECH (not ideas or abstract concepts) and do so in a way that is specific to the particular Chinese (Sinitic) language that one speaks. The long story about this can be found in the books The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy[1] or Visible Speech: The Diverse Oneness of Writing Systems[2] by the late John DeFrancis or the book Ideogram: Chinese Characters and the Myth of Disembodied Meaning[3] by J. Marshall Unger. The book Reading in the Brain: The Science and Evolution of a Human Invention[4] by Stanislas Dehaene is a very good book about reading in general, and has a good cross-cultural perspective.<p>I&#x27;ll give an example here of how Chinese characters reflect speech more than they reflect meaning-as-such. Many more examples are possible. How you might write the conversation<p>&quot;Does he know how to speak Mandarin?<p>&quot;No, he doesn&#x27;t.&quot;<p>他會說普通話嗎？<p>他不會。<p>in Modern Standard Chinese characters contrasts with how you would write<p>&quot;Does he know how to speak Cantonese?<p>&quot;No, he doesn&#x27;t.&quot;<p>佢識唔識講廣東話？<p>佢唔識。<p>in the Chinese characters used to write Cantonese. As will readily appear even to readers who don&#x27;t know Chinese characters, many more words than &quot;Mandarin&quot; and &quot;Cantonese&quot; differ between those sentences in Chinese characters.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Language-Fantasy-John-DeFrancis/dp/0824810686/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Language-Fantasy-John-DeFranci...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Visible-Speech-Asian-Interactions-Comparisons/dp/0824812077/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Visible-Speech-Asian-Interactions-Comp...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Ideogram-Chinese-Characters-Disembodied-Meaning/dp/0824827600/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Ideogram-Chinese-Characters-Disembodie...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://readinginthebrain.pagesperso-orange.fr/intro.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://readinginthebrain.pagesperso-orange.fr/intro.htm</a><p>Many other examples of words, phrases, and whole sentences that are essentially unreadable to persons who have learned only Modern Standard Chinese can be found in texts produced in Chinese characters by speakers of other Sinitic languages (&quot;Chinese dialects&quot;).

Just as &quot;googling&quot; is an erosion of the Google trademark, even when referring to Google&#x27;s searching service.<p>You see the impact of this sort of brand erosion with the iPad.  The iPad dominates the tablet space, so the constant references to iPads have started to genericize the term to the point that other tablets are often called iPads (which erodes the brand to a greater extent).  Contrarily, BMW for example gets away with this because BMWs do not dominate the market, so there is little danger of &quot;BMW&quot; becoming synonymous with the car.  IMAX dominates its market so the brand is quite in danger of becoming a synonym for a giant screen.  The smaller erosions are therefore a bigger concern.",1434733562

<a href=""http://cl.ly/image/071f1j0B0M3a"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/image/071f1j0B0M3a</a><p>And then it took me like 5 seconds to figure out how to chat. I first tried to click on people&#x27;s chat to reply to them and then I finally found the text input at the bottom of the screen. Then nothing would happen when I hit enter. Then I eventually found the blue circle send button and that didn&#x27;t work.<p>Then I tried Chrome. Worked! So I found some bugs in Safari :)<p>Amazing that this was done in 300 lines. Something about this format is immediately appealing. Maybe it&#x27;s because dots on a map feel more human than handles on a forum or comment thread.  Anonymity is this double-edged sword in communities. Maybe this is the minimum amount needed to make people behave? Probably not, but something IS interesting here.<p>Right now it&#x27;s just people shouting...I hope your next trick is to figure out how to turn it into conversations. Suggestion: Please don&#x27;t be tempted to just rewrite it or start from scratch. Iterate from this version because 1) it would be faster and 2) this one already has some magic in it.<p>Thanks for sharing!",1434733266

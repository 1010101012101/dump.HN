He veered toward #1 above at the very end, but still this was interesting to read.<p>Every single one of these things above, though, traces back to ignorance (usually) or cirucmstance. Could Facebook do a better job of making these things obvious? Absolutely. Facebook is not an intuitive site to use, and even when you have your head around it, they usually change something arbitrarily (the recent email thing comes to mind).<p>However, that said, you really shouldn't dump on the site wholesale just because it doesn't work for you.

I'll try to share my (somewhat rambling) take on this.<p>>Sometimes in the chaotic trenches of a startup people make bad decisions. Your company seems like the only thing in the world and youre willing to do anything to ensure its survival. Youre stressed and overworked. It can be a recipe for disaster.<p>In my short experience running a business I've learned that it is indeed very stressful, most of the time. You get it from all angles and chances are you're working day and night at weird hours. You begin to form a bubble around you because all you think about is the company and its success. It's easy to lose sight of other important things like the people around you and the people you interact with. Certainly a recipe for disaster. It is absolutely critical that you keep a level head. Maintain your mental health and don't let things get to you too much. (Thanks go to jacquesm, who helped me with this during a particularly troubling time.)<p>>At the time it might feel pragmatic [...]<p>Sometimes I find myself making what I consider to be 'tough calls' or difficult decisions. Often times just trying to go by the book (or the policies I've set). Occasionally the decisions I make leave a bad taste in my mouth. Not because they were necessarily wrong or heavy handed at all. Just that they could have been more right... if that makes sense. It's more than just doing what is pragmatic or technically correct. It is people you're dealing with, after all. There are feelings to take into account.<p>>You should always treat people with respect, first and foremost because this is how fellow human beings deserve to be treated. But you should also remember that its a long life in the small valley.<p>This is a really important thing to remember. It's easy to get caught up in the heat of defending your position or policies. Nearly all tech startups must work with many people on the web at large. There may be thousands, even tens or hundreds of thousands of individuals that your startup(s) will encounter along the journey. If you really want to cover your bases for your future then be respectful to everyone. (I am also reminding myself here.)<p>That said I'm not a big fan of the Valley, its relatively small number of players, or the cabals. I wish less advice pretended like it's the only place in the whole wide world. (Then again, if that is your only experience to draw upon I can see why you'd talk about it like that.)",1340926607

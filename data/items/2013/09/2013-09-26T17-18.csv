Unit testing is good at testing small chunks of code for things like valid inputs/outputs, but not for validating whether the software performs as specified. Functional testing is hard to automate initially, but can be automated for regression testing. Performance testing, on the other hand, is easy to automate. Sounds like your organization is pushing automation as a way to control costs, without perhaps fully understanding <i>what</i> can be automated and <i>when.</i>",1380218324

Machines can make mistakes with horrible consequences, but so can humans. Similar arguments are used against many forms of valuable automation, such as self driving cars. The benefit of using machines is that mistakes are quantifiable and can be fixed en masse. There&#x27;s no way to know if any given anaesthesiologist is having an off day and there&#x27;s no one fix for the potential problem. Most automation issues can be fixed with time and more data.<p>The outlook is grim for automating similar medical tasks because of the same problem that Sedasys is facing: the human inclination towards turf protection. Professional organizations make a lot of dues money from their members, which is then use to purchase enough clout to delay the FDA at least once.

Besides, ever met a muslim that didn&#x27;t care what halal was ? Ever wondered what &quot;halal&quot; refers to. These people that call themselves muslim use the sources I referred to as guidance on what is halal, they do <i>not</i> decide for themselves.<p>2) slavery, incuding kidnapping people, even children into slavery is halal. So is raping them. Yes there&#x27;s limits to exactly who, when and where, but frankly that doesn&#x27;t matter to the morality of that. Halal = morally reprehensible.<p>3) Even seemingly stupid parts of the islamic faith, like halal food (practiced by the vast majority of muslims), you&#x27;re going to find discriminatory/racist at best (religious discrimination in employment, to start with). Even that part is morally reprehensible.<p>4) I disagree strongly with your assessment that &quot;those who see the West as the devil come from countries where the West has severely harmed in the past through selfish and corrupt interference&quot;. Aside from the fact that that statement reads like a conspiracy theory, those hotbeds you refer to are Saudi Arabia, Somalia and Pakistan. In a different way Egypt has been a hotbed. You <i>might</i> be able to build a weak case America has harmed Somalia, but the others have massively benefited from America&#x27;s influence and help.<p>I propose instead that those who see the west as the devil come from societies (or at least families) that take islam very seriously and let it guide their life. The stronger the place of islam in their lives, the more hate for everyone they have (not just for America, in case you truly are that naive. Israel, Holland (because there is a whore at every intersection, one Egyptian explained to me not very long ago), France (something about a Jewish school that you just can&#x27;t repeat, and the &quot;fact&quot; that they support ex-muslims in Lebanon), Ethiopia, Kenia, ...).<p>> Religious rhetoric aligns itself with realpolitik.

Yes, there are plenty of the believers that draw a hard line, but by stereotyping you potentially alienate other believers that would otherwise gladly contribute to the discussion.<p>There are many Christians that believe in evolution. There are many that believe in creation and many that believe in a hybrid of the two.<p>I consider myself a &quot;True Christian&quot;, and yet I am not a die-hard fundamentalists.  I believe that Someone got this whole party started, but I don&#x27;t believe there are enough facts to establish exactly how much they interacted with this thing we call earth, life, and the universe.<p>If there is a God, then he would have to know all the science, even the science we don&#x27;t know, sort of like the ultimate hacker.  So he sets up his lab (the universe) aligns all the conditions and drops his sample into the petri dish (earth).  I believe that much.  The question is, how much did he have to interact with the petri dish after that?  Did he have to add food? or zap things with lasers?  Did he have to move the dish to a different light source at some point?  If creation was setting up the lab and getting things started did he not still create this world?<p>Note: I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re all just one big science experiment.  But if God is all knowing (which is fairly universally accepted among the religious) then he would know science.  But at the same time, are our scientists not working towards artificial life?  Cold fusion?  The physics behind orbits and the like?  If we had all the resources and technology we needed would we not have scientists that would want to &quot;move a planet&quot; and try to start life?<p>Either way, now you have two people, one non religious, and one believer who have a common scientific understanding to start from: The theory of evolution is completely possible and we can work together to test, re-test, prove and improve the theory until it becomes fact or is disproved.<p>TLDR; Your stereo types and blanket dismissive statements can do as much to hinder the science you&#x27;re trying to promote as the firm line that many of your opponents draw on this topic.

The actual &quot;feature&quot; of resetting the system (sending it the appropriate non-maskable interrupt) was handled in early PC&#x27;s by the keyboard controller, which was a chip on the motherboard.

The issue was that the BIOS we got from AWARD couldn&#x27;t deal with the fact that there was no controller, it would enable the interrupt anyway and I guess the pin was simply not connected on the interrupt controller so we&#x27;d get random interrupts. Back and forth half in English and half in Chinese to get the BIOS fixed, every time an update came it would be broken again. It became such an issue that the HW engineer built a small board that had the controller on it that could be &#x27;blue wired&#x27; into the circuit so that we could continue to debug/build stuff while the BIOS guys were in a &#x27;broken&#x27; cycle.

This also allows you to cut down a lot easier in the case of a pinch.<p>I don&#x27;t own but rent - economically in the long run buying would be more advantageous but being able to move in a heartbeat or quit my job to start my own business took priority over that. I am religious about saving cash. Every month before my paycheck (used) to drop in my account I would put a decent percentage into savings - this was after 401k contributions (which I did about ~10%). If i received a bonus at work 90% would go directly to savings either in the form of my personal investment account or cash reserves (with 10% always going to 401k). The remaining 10% was for the family slush fund.<p>From a financial planning perspective 10% might be low for 401k but I believe I can make my money work harder outside of it. My household cost is similar to yours (~45k), I add 10k to keep sanity (vacations with wife, anniversary presents, etc).<p>Disclaimer: This is working for a established tech firm paying towards the high end of industry average and working there for 5 years. If you are in a startup your salary is lower and lopsided towards equity so achieving this cushion I imagine is a lot harder.",1380216864

In many situations, people with legitimate claims have been unable to overcome the heightened pleading standard, not because their claim is weak, but because the evidence required to plead the claim is difficult to come by.<p>Many of the changes suggested by the article can already be accomplished using existing procedural devices. The only provision I see as having any teeth is the one that deals with fee shifting. Fee shifting provisons are a big deal as recoving attorneys fees is very rare in the American legal system. Generally fee shifting provisions allow the winner to collect legal fees even if nominal damages (e.g. $1) are awarded.

No other phone maker can say that.<p>Secondly, Apple&#x27;s profit is uniquely enriched because it has built the platfrom that it has -- again, no other phone manufacturer reaps the direct from consumer benefit Apple does.<p>Lastly, because Apple sells markets/sells to the consumer, the consumer picks Apple <i>first</i> and then the carrier -- many change carriers but continue to be loyal to Apple as a phone maker.  This is definitely the culmination of a major sea change in the mobile industry.  Apple may not the only phone maker that has ever had a consumer act this way, but they are the first to have it happen on a widespread basis.",1380216395

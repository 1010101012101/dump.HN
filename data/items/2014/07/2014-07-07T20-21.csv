The &quot;Home&quot; link is unnecessary. The &quot;Sign In&quot; and &quot;Sign Up&quot; links should go to anchor tags at the sign in and sign up forms.<p>- The Birthdate drop down menus are broken for me on the sign up form. I only see a vertical scroll bar when I select the day and month, and I have both vertical and horizontal scroll bars when I select the year.<p>- The What I Want page should initially has nothing selected in each box. I think each option should start populated with &quot;Anything&quot;. That way if I don&#x27;t care about pets one way or another, I don&#x27;t have to waste a few clicks setting it. Or do I need to actually change an option from &quot;Choose Option&quot; to &quot;Anything&quot;? It&#x27;s unclear.<p>- When I finally select everything in the &quot;What I Want&quot; page, the red text &quot;Please choose an option for each field.&quot; doesn&#x27;t go away. Did I not select everything well enough?<p>- At the bottom of the &quot;What I Want&quot; page you have every percentage listed from 16/16 to 0/16. Is that really necessary?<p>- The Profile page has square images on top of other users, but when I resize my browser window too small horizontally they&#x27;re squished into rectangles. In addition, those images are huge! It took a few seconds for them to load the first time I visited the page. They should probably be resized. Also, perhaps profile images should be stored as jpegs instead of pngs?<p>- Search form, perhaps it should be pre-populated with the options that I chose on the &quot;What I Want&quot; page? And again, even when I have every option selected, it still says &quot;Please choose an option for each field.&quot;<p>- On someone&#x27;s profile, under their Personality Type, there&#x27;s a yellow circle that on mouseover says &quot;They don&#x27;t have your preferred personality type, but keep reading!&quot;. What? When did I specify a preferred personality type?<p>On a whole, it looks well done for a MVP. Some other people have criticized the lack of design, but personally, I like the minimalist look.

These days I&#x27;ve become a bit of a generalist with a lean towards networking, protocols and working on what I think of a data-centric development projects. A couple of years ago we were trying to find a frontend guy, and for whatever reason had no luck so I went back and taught myself a bit.<p>These days I end up doing a lot of solo projects, full stack. DB, actual code, front end, etc. Essentially everything but the visual design.<p>I&#x27;ve realized though, the frontend (html/js/css) take an inordinate amount of time compared to everything else. Outsourcing doesn&#x27;t seem to help, as even with local people with good reputations I end up spending about as much time correcting and managing them to get the same results as I can produce.<p>Love ruby for my high level language so I&#x27;m using rails on most everything, and as friendly of a stack as I can find. Slim, Scss, Coffeescript, bootstrap or the bourbon ecosystem for my starting framework. It is a lot better than it could be, but honestly it still sucks. Everything about the web portion seems to be crud layered on top of crud.<p>I had some downtime recently and spent it with some procedural content generation, a couple thousand lines over the course of a few days. Implementing interesting algorithms and stitching them together instead of the repeatedly beating state onto a stateless medium that is the modern web.<p>So, realizing the power of the web and the tradeoffs being worth it, even with it being a time sink.

This is a Very Bad Idea. You will be taking on a huge amount of debt in exchange for a credential that will not make you substantially more employable in any other field than law.<p>Question Two: ARE YOU <i>SURE</i> YOU WANT TO BECOME A LAWYER?<p>There is a glut of J.D.s out there currently, far more than there are real legal jobs available (see <a href=""http://www.newrepublic.com/article/87251/law-school-employment-harvard-yale-georgetown"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newrepublic.com/article/87251/law-school-employme...</a>).

Going into debt to get a J.D. from Harvard or Yale or Penn or Duke is a reasonably sensible long-term financial proposition; going into debt to get one from Bob&#x27;s Chicken-Fried Steak Shack and School of Law, much less so.",1404766376

So you have to prioritize things?<p>If it can&#x27;t do it now, today, when it&#x27;s small, there is simply no way bitcoin is going to grow, which is troubling for the future of bitcoin.<p>The requirement that every transaction is recorded forever is already causing problem (the block chain is HUGE). And the fees are just a method to try to reduce the side of the data.<p>Instead a completely different method should be used: A cleanup cycle where old blocks are consolidated and discarded. (The miners agree that the new block is valid, then the old block is no longer needed.)<p>(Also as a side note bitcoin will never survive past the last mined block. Miners will not continue to mine just for fees, but the amount of entrenched hashing power in place by then means that destroying the network will be trivial for people.)",1404766260

Just as (to pick a high-level, desktop-oriented language at semi-random) C# is easier to work with than x86 assembly language, because it hides the messy details, I think the author would like a world where building a web application is as easy as building a desktop application: a world where issues like data serialization, browser-specific JavaScript hacks (and the hacky frameworks meant to solve them), incompatible databases, constant vigilance against easily preventable attacks (cross-site scripting, SQL injection, etc), and the necessity of juggling at least 3 different languages (JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and whatever you have on the backend) do not occupy valuable developer brainspace.<p>The issue is that the current web technology stack was never meant for building applications. HTML was designed for static documents. JavaScript&#x27;s early development was mainly for making terrible mouseover-effects on links. XMLHttpRequest is a historical accident. So, yeah, it all works together, somehow, but it wasn&#x27;t designed to be used as it is today, and it shows. And it&#x27;s the developers who carry the burden of integrating these hacks. I, like the author of this article, wonder if it wouldn&#x27;t be nice to design a system to provide the advantages of the web (distributed client-server applications with highly-customizable, visually attractive front-ends delivered on-demand) with a slightly more human development process. If we can&#x27;t replace the web outright, maybe we can build better tools ontop of it.<p>I agree that current web technology is a horrible pile of kludges. Let&#x27;s try to build something better. Some attempts are already being made. Please check out the amazing Ur/Web language [1] that lets you write front-end code, back-end code (compiled to native), and database code in a single, type-safe language that statically guards against errors that are rife in dynamically-typed web scripting languages. It abstracts the database, without wrapping your data in an annoying object layer; it lets you write front-end and back-end code in one language that communicate transparently. It is far from a finished product but it is an amazing glimpse and what could be with intelligent develop tools. There are some great examples on-line that show how easy it could be. Easy for a developer, of course, not for a layperson.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.impredicative.com/ur/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.impredicative.com/ur/</a>",1404764857

After all, both &quot;kinds&quot; of probabilities share the same mathematics.<p>I think it&#x27;s the other way around. People have certain intuitions, or prejudices if you wish, and it&#x27;s useful to have terms that match your intuitions - even if they are slightly redundant. I find it helps me understand and explain statistical problems better.<p>About the coin: I think you have to distinguish between one concrete flip of the coin, and the coin itself. The coin itself has certain probabilities for generating heads and tails, and they don&#x27;t change.<p>A concrete flipping of the coin is a different situation. You might see the coin, and know with near 100% certainty what it shows. Or you might have some machine which detects whether it is heads or tails, and this machine has a certain accuracy. When it signals heads, you might say it has a 95% plausibility to really be heads. And before you measured the state of the coin, you might say the plausibility is 50%, assuming the coin is fair. So the plausibility does change at time of observation (or when you get new information).<p>What about the time of the flip? Well, after the flip has occurred, this concrete instance is either 100% heads or 100% tails of course. If I repeat <i>this exact coin toss</i> (which I can&#x27;t do in reality), I will always get the same result. And the probability to have heads, when you have heads, is 100% (P(toss #1 is heads | toss #1 is heads) = 100%).<p>This statement is a bit silly, but I think it shows that the probability of a thrown, lying coin to be heads or tails is not a very interesting quantity. Our degree of belief, given certain facts, that it is heads or tails, is interesting. And the probability of the coin in general, determined by its geometry, is interesting. And especially interesting is how you get from one to the other, which is where Bayesian inference, hypothesis testing, and so on come in (The coin is known to be rigged with heads=99%. My flawed detector says it is tails. What should I believe is the state of the coin, or what should I bet on?).<p>Finally, I should note that you should take what I&#x27;ve said with a grain of salt.

The way I see it, IMAP and POP suckage is not a developer problem; it&#x27;s a user problem. As in, users don&#x27;t care that IMAP and POP suck; they only care that their email works. Most people&#x27;s email works.<p>In other words, you can make developers as happy as clams and it won&#x27;t matter, because &quot;making developers happy&quot; is not a sustainable business model. (Particularly if the way you are going to make them happy is to open source your toolkit and give it away for free. Not that that isn&#x27;t a great thing to do: it&#x27;s just not a sustainable business model.) I think a lot of the skepticism in this thread is because on some level everyone realizes this, even thought it&#x27;s kind of an unpleasant truth for developers.<p>A sustainable business model would be: you&#x27;re going to (a) convince users that, even if their email works now, it will work so much better with your new platform that they&#x27;ll be amazed; and then (b) get the users to pay for that awesome service. I have seen nothing that indicates you have such a business model. Without it, I have to agree with the skeptics that, from a VC&#x27;s perspective, you are far more likely to exit as an acquisition than as an IPO. Which means the VCs aren&#x27;t really investing in your business, they&#x27;re investing in your talent; that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re betting that some large company will be willing to pay for down the road, once you&#x27;ve demonstrated the ability to build something.

Note that there are no feminine words which we gender-neutralize in a similar way--we refer to a collective as &quot;guys&quot; or humanity as &quot;mankind,&quot; but never use &quot;gals&quot; or &quot;womankind&quot; to refer to a mixed-gender group. In this way we construct women as an other, in opposition to men: the expected members of the workplace are guys, we expect history-makers to be men, and women are the odd exception to that rule.<p>It is important to note that very few of the people who use these linguistic constructs are being intentionally sexist in doing so, and as such nobody is taking hurt or offense away from the use of &quot;guys&quot; to refer to a mixed-gender group or anything like that. This is not an exercise in respecting others&#x27; sensitivities so much as an effort to recognize the way our actions subtly reinforce the problematic and undoubtedly biased power structures that exist in our current culture.

When I read things like, &quot;This means that they can&#x27;t offer me a bigger book advance for world rights than they would for their own regional rights (because they might not succeed in licensing those territorial sub-rights—this has bitten me in the past),&quot; I wonder if it wouldn&#x27;t be significantly simpler all around if authors worked on straight royalties.<p>I get that it would mean that an author would not get a big, lump sum payment with which to write the next work. On the other hand, what was the author eating while writing the first book? Further, most advances are not going to keep a body in beans and rice for very long. And I get that under current schemes, most authors don&#x27;t earn out their advances, and that a larger-than-royalties advance is the only thing that makes writing a paying occupation. But, I find the idea of someone making a loan that they don&#x27;t expect to be paid back fully is economically sketchy. It smacks of company-store policies. Also, while the &quot;gambling&quot; aspect does support the idea that a few bestsellers subsidize dozens of other, less successful, authors, I think it equally supports the idea that new authors are barred from the marketplace: giving an unproven author with a genre-barrier-crossing any advance is singularly unpalatable.",1404763409

This is all from my history and point of view so I&#x27;m sure a lot of people will disagree.<p>Cost:<p>The days when big companies developed tooling and platforms cfor developers where great IF you worked at a company that could afford to pay for them.  They were expensive. When I first started these suites were tens of thousands of dollars expensive, and later just thousands of dollars. Sure they did a lot of stuff, but man there was also A LOT of overhead in managing the suite.  For young people and very small companies these things were unaffordable, and frankly unmaintainable.  A lot of times you would here about companies who paid 10-20K for a suite only to not use it due to the training required for everyone,  the installation cost, and the need to change your development process to fit the platform&#x27;s model.   So anyone starting out as a developer or starting up as company would find the cheapest/easiest options available.  And since there are far more small development teams than big companies there was far more demand and community support for free/cheap systems that while not great could get the job done.   Linux was free, mysql was free,Php was free, Perl was free, Javascript was free, and there were communities that would support a new developer through getting these up and running (no 2500 training class required).  The reason the LAMP stack became so popular was because it was free, could be installed on cheap hardware, and every element had a community that would support it.<p>Cross Platform Support and Application Distribution:<p>With C++/C you had to compile for every target machine. What a nightmare,  library flags, macros, ugh.  Testing had to have special labs so they could find bugs that would popup in one OS, but not another.  Then it had to be cloned on disks and shipped out.  \nJava came around with write once run everywhere which was better (MS came out with CLI and .net). The problem with these was making sure your customers had the base platform installed (the JRE or .net).  B2B companies was a little easier because they had standardized equipment and IT departments that knew what to do, but if you were targeting B2C or small business then getting them to install the base software (again JRE/.NEt) was a pain because they would more than likely mess it up or just not know what to do so it required manual intervention.  As soon as this got easier you wound up with the conflict of people having TOO much installed on their computer and just not wanting to install anything else unless they HAD to.\nFast forward to now and we&#x27;ve got a built in client that adhere&#x27;s to common standards. If they want to use your app they bookmark it, and when they are sick of it they just delete the book mark. Sure there&#x27;s cross browser issues, but they are far easier to deal with than both having the customer install some platform and dealing with cross OS issues (plus you dealing with them doesn&#x27;t require the customer to do anything but hit the refresh button).<p>Developer Inequality:<p>I don&#x27;t know how you can say there&#x27;s a higher barrier to entry now than previous.  In the 90&#x27;s almost everyone you met who was a developer was a CS/EE major or started on computers at the age of 12. The arcane level of knowledge required for using platform to build an application in the 90&#x27;s dwarfs what&#x27;s required now. I still remember struggling with bugs where you&#x27;d go hunting for &quot;the guy&quot; who new everything, and then you&#x27;d spend a couple of days trying to figure where the issue was only to find some undocumented outcome to a flag passed to a lib. To the developer who was working for XXXX who wrote the library it this was a completely obvious and logical result.\nCompare that to now.  StackExchange. Free Video tutorials, Websites dedicated to teaching you.  I constantly meet graphic designers, marketers, accountants, etc. who decided to become developers. I know who guy who has built a decent business with no official development education at all.  He learned rails and shoved up to heroku. He learned javascript to improve the client side, and now he makes a decent living.<p>You can start from NOTHING and in a few weeks have a base product built and being used by an alpha customer. That never would have happened 20 years ago.   I feel freer and more productive now as a developer than anytime in my career.",1404763287

So much is leaking that investors in China are buying large amounts of property in London, New York, and Miami, but not occupying it, as a way to stash cash.  However, the outflows aren&#x27;t big enough to affect the value of the yuan.<p>The People&#x27;s Bank of China (comparable to the Treasury Department plus the Fed) hasn&#x27;t cracked down as much as they could. There seems to be an internal policy disagreement within China&#x27;s government over whether the yuan should be an international currency.  To be used internationally means allowing convertibility and giving up some control, and facing the possibility that China&#x27;s domestic economy can be yanked around by world events.  But convertibility increases China&#x27;s external economic power.  Back in 2013, there were announcements of convertibility within the next year.  In November 2015, the target date was 2020.[1] China&#x27;s stock market crashed last week, which may prompt tightening up on capital outflows again.<p>Much of what happens with Bitcoin is driven by these far larger issues.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-03/china-development-plan-to-promote-tech-capital-markets-reform"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-03/china-deve...</a>",1453063944

I like to think of Stallman as Chomsky -- a little out there, really attached to their ideologies, but usually they bring up a conversation that&#x27;s worth having.<p>The second I heard this, I as did you thought about the problem of hosting your data at a DC; likewise, I too saw the &#x27;everyone hosting their own server&#x27; problem[2]. It&#x27;s no coincidence that there are at least 3 of us (StravosK and the #letsauth HN crew, you, I) working on this. Many more[3] in fact that we might be reaching the &quot;too many NoSQL solutions out there&quot; problem.<p>I agree with you I haven&#x27;t had time to go over your work but consensus algos for removal of data is an impossibility (the second someone has access to the decrypted data is the second it&#x27;s fully compromised at the read level[1], and only later can one mark the data as unreliable. Consensus to determine what&#x27;s unreliable is possible, though fraught with peril. There be dragons.) Secondly - and I say this as someone who&#x27;s working on software similar to what you are writing - in order for crypto to be adopted there needs to be a lot of things. Primarily, there needs to be one, at worst two, solutions - or we&#x27;ll suffer from complete and total &#x27;choice overflow&#x27; (i.e. which NoSQL solution do I use? There are 50!). Secondarily, crypto should ideally be written around known algos, and more importantly, known algo implementations (e.g. libsodium) which are based around concepts and have been heavily audited. Finally, there should be interop between the systems. I.e., keybase.io has already solved the problem of getting techies to adopt asymmetric crypto/figure out how to exchange keys/etc by tying a users FB identity to it. Not the ideal solution, but the best trade off for user adoption. Awareness is hard, but if we all band together (#letsauth + keybase.io + Automattic is a realistic possibility), I don&#x27;t see it being impossible.<p>Bottom-line: _Ensure interop with previous implementations so we don&#x27;t overwhelm the internet with choice, effectively shooting ourselves in the foot_<p>[1] I can write an IO device driver in a weekend that&#x27;ll clone bit-for-bit anything that hits a specific directory, segment of memory alloc&#x27;d by a process, etc. Once your information is out, it&#x27;s out for good.<p>edit: [2] On second thought, not as far-fetched as it may seem. ARPAnet was designed around maintaining network communication in case of nuclear disaster, and if you read the spec sheets that came out during that time decentralization was their solution. Everything from routing (RIP, OSPF, BGP, take your pick) to SMTP (the RFC is rife with the capacity to handle server unreliability) was designed with the intention of dealing with this. Not only that but before NAT took over, effectively every machine was effectively capable of operating as a server.   It wasn&#x27;t until say the mid 90s that the distinction between workstation and server became clear. Effectively, you trusted your sysadmin to not read your mbox/maildir and he acted as your technical agent. When my friends and I were dicking around with BSD and Slackware in middle school and early high school (oh what rebels), we ran our own SMTP&#x27;s acting as backup MX for each other when our Pentium 2&#x27;s were rebooted by our parents. This is all a long way of saying, not everyone needs to run a comm-server, just one (or two if you need a &#x27;backup MX&#x27;) per social network in order to offer their services to people within their social &quot;web of trust&quot;.<p>[3] <a href=""http://pythonhackers.com/p/redecentralize/alternative-internet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pythonhackers.com/p/redecentralize/alternative-intern...</a> - That&#x27;s not even the start of it.<p>Edit2: Yeah, #letsauth on freenode is the defacto standard, thus far.

The simplest way to describe those 42 values: the value we want to output (the shortest value) is very close to the midpoint between two floating-point values. Since the best answer so close to a midpoint, its difficult for the algorithm to decide which direction that number will round.<p>So, how can we make sure that such numbers are converted correctly? The answer from Steel & White&#x27;s paper is to perform arbitrary integer arithmetic and leave nothing up to chance. The Grisu3 algorithm by Loitsch showed that 64-bits correct converts about 99.5% of numbers. As you increase the amount of precision, you can improve your accuracy, but there is no guarantee that even 128-bits or 256-bits is enough to correctly convert all numbers.<p>Instead of trying to be 100% correct, our algorithm sidesteps the issue entirely by enumerating all failures a priori.",1453061288

It&#x27;s about 1:15 but fully worth the watch including the QA, if you have any interest in &#x27;open hardware&#x27;. That Rockchip run&#x27;s on a fairly complicated 4core ARM. So which while the instruction set may be open, so is Intels. They&#x27;ll happily ship to you their 3 volume multi-thousand page ISA. (Open is when you get to see any of final Altium/Cadence files that were used for the tape-out to make production wafers). At best you might get a few block diagrams. Good luck getting anything more than that. The closest you&#x27;ll get to something open might be collaborative open standards a la the OpenPOWER (still, not that open) or RISC-V (which is probably still fab&#x27;ing at what, 65nm? 45?)<p>Anyways, that Rockchip is far from open. watch the talk to see his rationale behind choosing Freescale as his microprocessor of choice. He remarks on how $2.25 SoC picked up on the streets of Shenzhen have the full capabilities to run on GSM, which is really pretty remarkable. Obviously they&#x27;re stealing IP and probably using grey-market tech/seconds that failed QA, but when he talks about the innovation _within_ that grey-market its fascinating. Even with his PhD in EE from MIT, experience in taking consumer products to market multiple times, fluency in Mandarin to aide in his ability to navigate the markets of Shenzhen, he&#x27;d have a real difficult time making a low-unit production run to compete with half the functionality of a low-level Android at twice the price because of the massive barriers to market. (Starting with easy things like UL certs and proper EMI shielding to more difficult political issues in getting a phone like that through the FCC and to the consumer).

From the second paragraph:<p><i>[B]y helping startup founders I&#x27;ve been helping to increase economic inequality. If economic inequality is bad and should be decreased, I shouldn&#x27;t be helping founders. No one should be.</i><p>I think this is ridiculous.  Creating new millionaires is not increasing inequality.  I don&#x27;t know anyone who thinks that (not to say that Paul might not have run into a few people who think that way).  The problem, as you say, is the profound concentration of wealth into the hands of a few multi-billionaires.  I would say also, it&#x27;s the fact that the middle class in the US is actually shrinking.<p>The fundamental way that the wealthy can help the middle class, while helping themselves at the same time, is by investing in new businesses that create jobs.  This is precisely what YC is doing!  This isn&#x27;t <i>increasing</i> inequality but <i>decreasing</i> it.  Not only are they creating jobs directly, they&#x27;re also doing so indirectly, by teaching people -- even those who don&#x27;t get into their program -- how to start startups.<p>Founders don&#x27;t get rich unless they build a successful business.  And again, I don&#x27;t think anybody minds that they can get rich; after all, a lot of them then either start new businesses or become angel investors themselves.  There&#x27;s nothing wrong with <i>any</i> of this, quite the contrary, and if Paul really does run into people who think there is something wrong with it, this is what he should tell them.<p>I would go so far as to say that YC and its ilk are among the most creative, hopeful, <i>positive</i> things happening in the US economy today.  Though I&#x27;m not involved with them directly -- I haven&#x27;t even worked for a YC company -- I am very glad to have them here in the Valley, and I&#x27;m excited to see what they do in the coming years.",1453061194

6602976,comment,6600623,6602911,1,0,rayiner,,,"Looking at one specific lobbying effort totally ignores all the other money that gets spent that yields nothing. The analysis of S&P 500 companies since 2002 also conflates correlation with causation. In the last decade, a disproportionate share of corporate profits have gone to the financial and energy industries, which just happen to be heavily regulated and thus spend a lot of money on lobbying. But lobbying isn&#x27;t responsible for the boom in those industries, but rather unrelated market factors (namely, the worldwide explosion in energy demand as well as the demand for good investment returns from a generation of westerners nearing retirement).<p>If lobbying yielded 2,200% returns in a predictable way, the entire industry would be a heck of a lot bigger than the $3.5 billion a year it is today (which sounds like a lot of money, but is a pittance compared to how much money is spent by corporations on things that yield a lot less than quadruple-digit returns!)",1382579673
6602975,comment,6601515,6602497,12,0,FaceKicker,,,"> One thing that annoys me about closed ranges (and it&#x27;s not much talked about) is that it is impossible to express the empty range: in python [i:i] is an empty range, while closed ranges always contain at least one element. That makes closed ranges strictly less expressive than half-open ranges, making often necessary to write special cases for zero-length.<p>In matlab/octave you can write an empty range as a(i:i-1).  Not to say that that&#x27;s at all elegant or aesthetically appealing, but it does work.  But I 100% agree with the sentiment; one of my favorite things about using NumPy rather than matlab in my research code is the vastly superior indexing, in large part due to the fact that it&#x27;s 0-based.  matlab&#x27;s indexing really is painful and off-by-one-error prone for doing anything other than a(1:n).",1382579650

Amongst the fashion, make-up and hair niches Pinterest is pretty darn popular. Fashion stylists use it to create inspiration collections, make-up artists use it for helping create new looks and hairdressers especially love creating hair collections for inspiration as well.<p>There is also another segment that Pinterest appeals to and it&#x27;s massive: women. Pinterest is used by a lot of women to create wishlists and curate their own look collections. My girlfriend has an avid interest in vintage clothing & decor and the TV show Mad Men and she uses Pinterest to create outfits that match those of the TV show. But not only that, she uses it as a shopping basket/wishlist of sorts and that kind of data is surely valuable. I know for a fact she has made purchases as a result of collections she has created on Pinterest, more times than I can count and I assume many other people have as well.<p>Many might not see the appeal in what appears to be from the outside an over-glorified image collecting service, but it&#x27;s obvious it&#x27;s a lot easier for Pinterest to make money in comparison to the likes of Facebook which currently struggle with monetisation.

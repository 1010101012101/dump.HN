If you do not care about such things, cars in need of body work will save you a decent amount -- just make sure there is no structural/mechanical damage.<p>What does ""required to drive 30 miles"" mean, though? The first thing to check, of course, is whether you could relocate closer (at least part of the time.) Do the math on the car cost, insurance, gas, other upkeep and see if it might be worth it to just shack up closer by instead.<p>The second thing, naturally, is mass transit: trains, buses? If the nearest station is a couple miles away, that is an easy <i>bike</i> ride (I think suggesting taking the bike 60mi/day would be a bit optimistic if you are not already cycling?)",1243788977

It ran fine for the 2 years we used it.<p>The last time I was in the states, I borrowed my parents' '87 camry (which I had owned previously).  Great car - it was pushing 200K miles a few years ago when my dad got into a minor accident that had the unfortunate side effect of ruining the seal on the trunk, making it useless for hauling his camera gear around in rainy Oregon.  It was still running great after all those years and miles, though.  You could probably pick up a car like that for less than $2000, no problem and drive it well beyond just one summer.<p>Now, with a family, I'd consider getting something nicer, but before having a kid, there's no way anyone would dissuade me from getting an older car that runs well.",1243787255

634794,comment,634692,634758,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Lua isn't usually associated with the functional languages. Besides mainly being promoted for embedded / extension use, I think the single biggest reason for this is that, while it has tail-call elimination, closures, first class functions, etc., you still have to say ""return x"" at the end of functions. I do a lot of FP-style stuff in Lua, and while the language doesn't actively resist it the way Python does, it's not the main direction its design flows.<p>It seems like a small thing syntactically, but languages that return the result of their last expression <i>by default</i> (I think of them as ""expression"" languages), and that require an explicit block for side-effects (begin in Scheme and OCaml, progn in Common Lisp, etc.), tend to get idiomatically used in a functional manner, while languages that default to a series of statements with side-effects and require an explicit return at the end (""statement"" languages) typically do not. While you can use several of the latter languages for functional programming, only the former are functional ""by default"".<p>Saying ""function(x) return x + 1 end"" is a tiny bit more trouble than ""fun x -> x + 1"" or ""(lambda (x) (+ x 1))"", so while lambdas still get used where they're the best fit (as arguments for map or filter, for example), they're less common overall. Defaults influence a language's overall style at least as much as what's theoretically possible. Python's concept of what's ""pythonic"" seems to be the most explicit acknowledgement of this.<p>Incidentally, I would <i>love</i> to see a language that crossed Lua with the ML family: a small, portable, clean implementation that interfaces easily with C, but with type inference, ML's top-notch module system, and (ideally) Haskell-style type-classes. OCaml is such a good language that I'm willing to tolerate its warts, but I'd strongly prefer a minimal ML-like language. (FWIW, I haven't used SML, though that's just because I do most of my programming on OpenBSD/amd64 and the smlnj port is i386 only.) When standalone, Lua is best suited to small/medium projects. Its historical emphasis on embedding in an existing project has made a module system for standalone use a bit of an afterthought.* As a project gets larger, static checking and stabilizing the module interfaces becomes far more important, and this is one area the ML languages really excel.<p>* For a good summary, see ""Almost Good Enough to Scale: A Lua Mail Handler and Spam Filter"" (<a href=""http://www.lua.org/wshop08.html#ramsey"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lua.org/wshop08.html#ramsey</a>)",1243786565

Someone offered to let me borrow their car for the summer (it's a summer job), but I don't exactly feel comfortable using their car, so I'm also looking for my own car.<p>I've been shopping on craigslist for used cars, and I've basically stumbled upon two choices that I can afford: cheap, older cars (c. 1995ish), or more expensive, newer cars (c. 2002ish).<p>Anybody have any ideas or suggestions?",1243785726

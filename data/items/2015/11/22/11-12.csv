Or is there a unique URL that I can share on my twitter or even SMS to my friends? If this is in place, what I will do is that once I install the app and take a selfie, I would share it on Facebook or twitter and ask my friends to rate. Now my friends interested in rating would download the app, rate me and possibly go on to use it themselves. Now, I have a &quot;friend network&quot; within the app I will engage with every time I need fashion advice.<p>Once this is in place, I would identify all people in my Facebook network who will find such an app useful and ask them for feedback - this way, you kickstart usage within your network.<p>Parallely, I will also start talking to influencers on Facebook/Youtube, etc. and maybe even pay them to share their selfies.<p>Without a viral element, all the effort you put into marketing will come to nought.",1448192365

10609780,comment,10609294,10609294,0,0,goodcanadian,,,"I&#x27;m a bit skeptical as all of the events used for dating are quite common. The constellations would appear every spring. The new moon occurs every 28 days. The particular alignment of the two planets would probably occur at least once a year, maybe more than once. Having said that, I have not done the math and it is possible that the exact confluence of these otherwise common events is quite rare.<p>However, assuming that their claim is correct, it is very interesting that the timing lines up with the solar eclipse which is itself, a very rare event. What I think is even more interesting is that this level of detail was remembered hundreds of years later when Homer was writing. That, by itself, suggests that something important happened and/or that Homer was working from a very detailed history of the time. Ignoring Odysseus for the moment, the fact that the timing lines up with the ash layer that is presumed to be the destruction of Troy is very interesting, and I believe that it lends a great deal of support to the historical fact of the Trojan war and more precisely, the destruction of Troy.<p>EDIT: to put it another way, I find it fascinating when literary evidence lines up with archeological evidence. It is rare to get two completely independent pieces of evidence in history this old, and it simultaneously puts the archeology in context while supporting the veracity of the writing.",1448191815

10609777,comment,10609294,10609294,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"It seems likely to me that Homer&#x27;s works were amalgams of stories from the period of the bronze age collapse. During this time there was a broad spectrum collapse of civilization and power structures in the Mediterranean, and there was extensive raiding from groups of folks collectively called the &quot;sea peoples&quot; of which the Mycenneans almost certainly were a part. The &quot;ten years&quot; of Odysseus&#x27;s journey is likely poetic license, but given that Troy was sacked and burned in 1183 BC and the eclipse occurred only 5 years later in 1178 BC it&#x27;s quite possible that there were dramatic and memorable stories around both those events which circulated in greece around those times. And then during the chaos of the Bronze age collapse and rebuilding of civilization (which took about 2 more centuries) resulted in heavy embellishment and modification of those stories until they congealed into the pseuo-mythological forms they took on before being codified into oral history (which can actually have a high accuracy of retaining details) until Homer formalized them.",1448191755

Actually Bidet Toilet Seats are nice for sure but they are expensive; to buy, install and maintain. A much lower cost alternative is the Hand Bidet Sprayer. It requires no new plumbing and actually does a better job cleaning you. If you&#x27;ve never tried both of these the Hand Bidet Sprayer provides a much stronger water flow and more control of where it sprays than the fixed &quot;spray wand&quot; in the bidet toilet seat which is more like a weak water fountain. You can also use the Hand Bidet Sprayer to spray water up inside to help with constipation and hemorrhoids. See bathroomsprayers.com.",1448190562

If it happened before 1857, as an imported loan word through other Polynesian speakers, then it even fits in with the context.<p>What did they call the place before the English came? The Wikipedia entry says &quot;The islands were historically known by the inhabitants as “jolet jen Anij” (Gifts from God)&quot;, though the citation is to <a href=""http://www.pacificrisa.org/places/republic-of-the-marshall-islands/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pacificrisa.org/places/republic-of-the-marshall-i...</a> which says &quot;The Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) is historically referred to in folklore as “jolet jen Anij” (gifts from God).&quot; But names from folklore can be different than actual names (eg, &quot;The Promised Land&quot;/&quot;Land of Israel&quot;), and what little evidence I found suggests that is the case here.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, the embassy of the Marshall Islands in DC at <a href=""http://www.rmiembassyus.org/History.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rmiembassyus.org/History.htm</a> says:<p>> 500 BC - 2000 BC (approx.) - The first Micronesian navigators arrive in the Marshalls, calling the atolls Aelon Kein Ad (Our Islands).<p>though without a written language it&#x27;s surely hard to know the words used 2500 years ago.<p>And in &#x27;The Sea - The Marshallese World&#x27; by Dirk H.R.

UUIDv4, you need to ensure the generated IDs are not duplicated by ensuring you have not generated each ID before. Sounds like you&#x27;ve missed a critical step here.<p>UUIDv1 is pretty much your best bet here because it&#x27;s the <i>least</i> pain in the ass. 36 chars are hardly any less suitable for the use cases you mention than 22 chars. UUIDv1 can survive on a poor PRNG, so your reason for updating library isn&#x27;t really valid. Sure there&#x27;s a small amount of maintenance, but I&#x27;d expect a developer with solid experience and knowledge to almost immediately understand that (even) a 10 line homebaked solution is likely to cause more issues than a standardised algorithm developed specifically for this purpose.<p>&quot;10 lines of JavaScript&quot; isn&#x27;t really what you wrote now, is it?<p>As for your other use cases, CSPRNG!

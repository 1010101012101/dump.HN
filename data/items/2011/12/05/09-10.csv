If you're presenting an EMT with a ten-year-old, faded tattoo, you're placing them in an awkward position due to the lack of context.

I doubt any local/state/federal government is going to let the possibility of driverless taxis proliferate without similar licensing schemes.<p>I agree that having a car running privately is a lower per-mile cost, but that discounts the number of 'dead' miles that a for-hire car drives - the private car always takes the person where they want to go, while ordering one up via the internet is going to at a minimum double the per-mile cost, because only half the miles (as an average) will be utilised.  The car will also not always be in use because demand will never be that smooth, so the in-demand times have to be priced higher to make up for the quiet times.  Then there has to be a higher insurance cost, plus a margin to cater for damage to the cab, booking systems, marketing, etc etc.<p>It's not that hard to see where a cost goes from the 50c/mile to the ~$4/mile which isn't far under the taxi cost.<p>Taxi drivers make just over minimum wage in most places.  While the taxi (plate) owner does make a decent return if run well, it's not like there are a pile of taxi billionaires around.

In particular read ""On Designing and Deploying Internet-Scale Services"" (<a href=""http://mvdirona.com/jrh/talksAndPapers/JamesRH_Lisa.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mvdirona.com/jrh/talksAndPapers/JamesRH_Lisa.pdf</a>) and at least the first chapter of ""The Art of Unix Programming"" (<a href=""http://catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/</a>)<p>* Get to grips with debugging and profiling so you can figure out what's really happening. Tools like sar, sysstat, [d|k|s]trace, tcpdump, gdb etc and the equivalents for your datastore & application frameworks are invaluable and unfortunately for whatever reason you inevitably won't have all the metrics and monitors you need.<p>* Do try to understand every layer of your service. I have helped debug scale out related issues from Layer 2 to Layer 8. I have also had to debug many Layer 1 issues while bringing up a new Site or similar. I may not be a DBA, Network Engineer or Software Engineer but in the past I have had to wear those hats while scaling.<p>* Despite comments elsewhere about learning through Mentoring and baptism-by-fire there is a lot of real engineering & science theory you can lean on.

He woke up at his lake cabin the morning before he died complaining of chest pain and shrugged it off but was soon being transported unconscious to the hospital accompanied by his paramedic neighbor. He slipped into a coma and the next day with several of his children at his side, was removed from the ventilator.<p>My other grandfather, who lives in the same town I do, was 93 and had struggled for the past several years with a progressively debilitating illness which increasingly kept him from being able to do the things he wanted to do. A couple weeks before his death his health took a turn for the worse and he quickly began losing connection with the world. He did go to the hospital and tests were done and drugs given, but we soon understood that he wouldn't recover and we brought him home. The hospice nurses and caregivers were wonderful. All his children came as did many old friends. He died in his sleep in his bedroom with his wife and children there.<p>Both had advanced directives requesting minimal effort to prolong their lives. My grandfather here wanted no heroic efforts and ""no machines"". Even so, a lot of intense discussion among his children was involved in coming to peace and/or acceptance of what exactly that meant, what the moral and ethical implications of different interpretations were, and how best to carry out his wishes.<p>This is what I'm now doing and what I strongly encourage you to do now:<p>* Create an advanced health care directive for yourself. You can get forms and examples online.<p>* Consider the various situations one might end up in and lay out as explicitly as you can what you'd like to be done or not done to you. The more specific you are, the more likely your intentions will be followed and the less your family/loved ones may have to struggle with the interpretation.<p>* Talk to your your family and loved ones about your desires. It's a hard and awkward discussion to have but do it. Be clear and frank.<p>Takeaway: Have an advanced directive. Be as clear, specific, and explicit as you can about your desires. Share your desires with your family, loved ones, and care providers. It is helpful not only you but form them as well.",1323076538

Smart key selection (ie, something like IP or userid+millisecond time) is enough to ensure that if you do end up reprocessing the same file (eg, if a crash occurs mid-file), then duplicate records aren't inserted (use the equivalent of a bulk INSERT IGNORE for your db).<p>This scales to billions of log entries a day.",1323076202

Usually they help an attacker inject dangerous javascript or html content.<p>The element XSS works a little different. Instead of creating its own injections, it hijacks normal requests for resources, loading these from an attacker's server. Form data which was meant to stay in the application, will end up at the attacker's server as well.",1323075957

Differ phones have them in different orders, and the app deceleration has free reign to make them do whatever they want. The ""menu"" button sometimes hides crucial information and functionality, but there's no indicator when this is the case. In the Path app, recently lauded for its design and user experience, on one activity you have to press the phone's menu button, then choose ""menu"" from the onscreen menu. At that point, you're actually at the menu.",1323075665
3313809,comment,3313570,3313570,79,0,fingerprinter,,,"So, couple of things. Just had my wife read this (she is a doc) and we chatted about this.<p>We are in our mid-30s and several years ago she was admitted to the ER and then ICU for 7 days for an obviously life threatening situation. (She has a near blanket NO CODE, FYI). She recovered, but there was at least 48 hours where her odds were ""much worse than a coin flip"" as on of her colleagues told me.<p>So people distinguish the different situations, in that situation she and her colleagues (she was treated at her own hospital...given that it was the best hosp in the country) knew about her NO CODE and still treated her. The reason being that medical intervention was near 100% likely to produce a positive outcome and bring her back to a normal quality of life.<p>However, if given a terminal diagnosis such as in the story, my wife, without hesitation, said she would choose to go without treatment. She went further and wished that this type of article could make its way to the NYT or some other outlet to get normal folks to think about. She, like most doctors, has seen way too many people ""try to live"" only to saddle their family with huge expenses, not dramatically effect their prognosis and basically make the rest of their lives as painful as possible.<p>Obviously not a fun conversation to have with your SO, but I for sure know exactly what she wants and how to ask the right questions at the hospital just in case. She also knows what I would want and how to make the right decisions.",1323075624

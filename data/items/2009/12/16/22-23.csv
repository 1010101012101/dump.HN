They just measured the density.<p>From the density, though, you can get a pretty good idea of what it looks like. There are three basic ingredients which go into making planets: rock (including pure metals), ""ice"" (a catch-all term which includes all phases of water along with methane and ammonia) and hydrogen/helium mixture. Everything else is too rare to worry about. Knowing (basically) the density of each of these components, plus knowing the fact that H/He mixture won't accrete to a body until its mass goes beyond a certain point, you can put pretty good constraints on what the composition of a planet of a certain mass and radius should be.<p>Of course we could be wrong -- it could equally well be a ball of pure argon or something; however it's hard to imagine how any such thing would form.",1261004298

This year's city budget is an astonishing $6.6 billion — more than twice the budget for the entire state of Idaho — for roughly 800,000 residents.""</i><p>That comparison is so disingenuous.  They're comparing a <i>city</i> with one of the highest costs of living in the country to the second poorest Western <i>state</i>?  The cost of living in SF is about double that of Idaho.  The median value of a home in SF is $656,700, while in Idaho it's $138,190.  So why the ""astonishment"" at SF's budget being <i>only</i> twice that of Idaho?<p>Then there's the population issue.  The whole of Idaho has 1.5 million people, while SF alone has 0.8 million.  That's a huge concentration of people in one city.  Compare SF to Boise, the largest city in Idaho:  SF has 4 times the population.  That kind of concentration of people brings lots of problems just by itself.<p>I'm not saying SF doesn't have problems.  It clearly does.  But this particular comparison isn't exactly the fairest they could have come up with.  How about a direct comparison between the budget of SF and, say, NYC?",1261001427

I think I'd rather have control over exactly which version is chosen (where I can use implementation details in making a decision), rather than have it decide automatically based on claims expressed in the library metadata.<p><i>though we still have to specify a version, and keep up to date on what version supports what, so its hardly automatic for the dev or packager</i><p>I think the common case is for <i>new</i> development, you'd most likely develop against the most recent release version, but you don't need to keep up to date on which version supports what because you can continue to use the old versions with long-since compiled binaries as long as it can be installed along side the latest version.  I think people and distros, in general, are too quick to remove older versions from being installed (or even available), which increases the on-going maintenance requirements of still popular binaries.<p>On the other hand, during transition periods, distros have been pretty good about this, like the libc5 vs libc6 transition, and by providing compat packages.  But this has mainly been an issue with closed source abandonware (Skype for a long time was still using OSS and needed an ancient version of some audio libs).",1261001306

I told\nmyself there wasn't time, I had to devote every minute to the startup. Worse I\nate convenient foods (pizza, subs, fast food) to help save time.

I'm not sure\nwhat my body fat percentage was back then but my body weight was 215lbs and I'm\n6'0""/180cm tall.<p>To loose some weight, I started to get active, and I noticed benefits in my\nwork.

I began\na weight program and started playing Ultimate Frisbee regularly.<p>My friend and I are in the midst of starting another company (<a href=""http://igeejo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://igeejo.com</a>) and I hope to\nbuild the cardio and weights right into our schedules.

Most of his lectures he clearly shows you where things came from (i.e. how and why Matrix Elimination works, etc...). One of the reasons why he shows the different ways to multiply matrices in this lecture is because he uses it in subsequent lectures to show how null-spaces and column spaces work.<p>His lectures are not the be-all and end-all to linear algebra, but (IMHO) it gives you a great intuitive feel for linear algebra. Also remember that his particular course (18.06) is focussed on engineering students who tend to do less theoretic proofs than maths and natural sciences folk.<p>I personally like to get an intuitive understanding of how things work before delving into theory (maybe it is just me). I am currently (slowly) busy with a textbook called Linear Algebra (by Friedberg, Insel and Spence). This is a great textbook that shows you how matrices are defined from fields, etc… (i.e. theoretical). Yet it would be extremely difficult to understand without having an intuitive idea that Strang’s lectures give you.",1261000820

And this just shows that it's true even for very physically active people.<p>I train in Olympic-style Weightlifting, probably one of the more demanding physical activities. Elite international-level athletes in Weightlifting can be visually categorised into two groups: superheavyweights and everybody else.<p>Why? Because superheavies don't need to make a weight class, there is no incentive to strip down fat. So they eat heavily to support maximal hypertrophy and training intensity.<p>Whereas weightlifters trying to squeeze in at the top of a weight division will often have very low bodyfat. How is this achieved? Through a tightly controlled diet.<p>We are talking about athletes who in all other respects  <i>train the same way</i>. A Chinese superheavy trains the same way as a Chinese welterweight. A Bulgarian superheavy, same as a Bulgarian heavy. And so on.

4437952,comment,4436867,4437501,21,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Science!<p>We can tell how much dark matter is out there because we can ""weigh"" it through indirect measures. And then we can take different theories of dark matter (such as, say, the theory that it's all just a bunch of interstellar orphaned planets and ""black dwarfs"" and what-have-you made up of ordinary matter) and figure out what sorts of implications that would have, make predictions on observable effects of those different models and then test those predictions. And that is precisely what happened about 20-30 years ago. A lot of work was done to pin down what type of dark matter makes up the majority of it out there.<p>For example, you can point a telescope at a set of neighboring galaxies and look for brightening effects due to gravitational micro-lensing from a chance alignment of a ""macho"" (e.g. orphaned gas giant planet) along the line of sight. Surveys were set up and indeed found that there were orphaned ""macho"" objects in our galaxy, but the statistics showed that they were orders of magnitude too rare to make up the bulk of dark matter we know about from other studies. Another line of evidence involves studying the large-scale structure of the Universe (e.g. the layout of galaxies, galaxy clusters, etc.) and comparing it with various computer simulations of models with different assumptions on the composition of the mass of the Universe (e.g. 100% ""ordinary"" baryonic matter, various percentages of ""special"" dark matter such as cold and hot dark matter, WIMPs, etc.)<p>From this and many other lines of evidence we came up with very strong evidence that the vast majority of the mass budget of the Universe is in the form of so-called ""cold dark matter"" which is composed of weekly interacting massive particles other than neutrinos (neutrinos are dark matter, but we've been able to place an upper limit on how much they contribute to the dark matter budget of the Universe, because they are detectable to a degree, and it's only a fraction).<p>So that's it, just a simple matter of comparing the predictions of different theories with observations and eliminating the theories that do not predict what we actually see out there in the Universe.",1346056527

I believe Dark Matter to be the resultant force(and/or field) generated due to the interaction of the forces(and/or fields) of individual moving objects(matter).<p>consider a magnet(refer here as object) - something which has the property to attract(gravity like) and repel(field like):
Now if you were to have 2 magnets(moving objects) come close enough such that they repel(or attract); but due to forces(and/or fields) of other moving objects in their vicinity(or far enough[1]); they get locked or entangled such that their movement(and other properties) is now dependent on the strongest forces or fields of nearby objects. Over time; these other objects also  get entangled and tend to form clusters and keep moving(exhibiting other properties like radiation etc). But now their movement(and other properties) seem to be the resultant effect of forces (and/or fields) of all the objects now entangled - giving an illusion of some matter that exists - now known as Dark matter.<p>I have used magnets as just as an example - one could think of matter having both these properties to attract and repel - such that the area affected by them could vary depending on various properties of the objects(matter).<p>[1](far enough) - such that their observation is neglected; but these objects tend to have forces(and/or fields) that they affect a particular system under observation.",1346056146

Once there, the code pops the arguments, does stuff, pushes the return value, and jumps back to where it was called from. 
Once there, the return values and local variables get pop'ed, and execution continues.
Different compilers might use different conventions, but for our purposes this is a good enough model.<p>The way a normal function call would look in assembly might be:<p>mov  %eax <returnPoint> ;at assembly time, <returnPoint> is replaced with the memory address of the operation labled returnPoint:<p>push %eax ;save the return point to the stack<p>push %ebx ;push local variables and the arguments<p>...<p>jmp  <foo> ;jump to the memory location labled foo<p>returnPoint: pop ebx ;pop local variables and return values,<p>pop ecx<p>...<p>The thing to note in this example is that when you run the assembler, <foo> gets replaced with the memory location of the function code. If we want to a functional type thing, we need the address we jump to be able to change at runtime, so instead of having the assembler hard code the memory location to jump to, we need to get that information from a variable. This would look like<p>...<p>jmp [foo]<p>...<p>This time, foo is not pointing to a function, but rather to the memory location of a function pointer. This means that if we want to make it so when we call foo(), we run the bar() function, we would simply need to do:<p>mov foo <bar><p>foo is the memory location of the function pointer, and <bar> is the memory location of the function itself, so now when we dereference foo in the jmp, we will execute bar().<p>With regard to the ARM architecture, I've done a little bit of work in it, and it isn't more complex than x86.",1346054545

GAGA-3 will be about precision landing probably using a guided parafoil.<p>None of this is about orbit. Orbit == high velocity and altitude. Although high-altitude balloons regularly go about 40km that's still in the stratosphere and nowhere near space and the velocity is nowhere near what's needed.<p>These phone-based cubesats are a good idea. There have been plenty of phone-based balloon flights and there's no reason not to use them in satellites if you have some way of recognizing failure because of cosmic rays.",1346054533

That works but is a bit uglier than truly supported tracing breakpoints, and wouldn't appear to offer things like dumping the callstack to the output window or only triggering the print out only when specific conditions are met (i.e. a conditional tracing breakpoint). I suppose you could ad-hoc that as well by surrounding the print code with an if(<condition>) { print stuff }, <condition>. Works, hacky, but works I suppose.",1353106798

But my question wasn't how people get out from under the debt, rather it was how such a program could be designed so that it wouldn't have this issue.<p>For example, could you say<p>""You pay 10% of your salary and we'll match that, into an investment account that buys inflation protected treasuries, then when you reach the age of 55 you have the choice of getting 20%, 50% or 100% of your salary paid out annually until the total of the amount paid in + appreciation over that time reaches zero.""<p>Basically once the company/state had matched the 10% they have no further obligation. And if you're genetics were great and you lived to 115 perhaps your 'salary' would run out at 75 long before you died.

It dumped memory to disk (with nice progress indicator :)), restarted and booted perfectly ok, just asked me if I want to send the data about the crash to Microsoft. It never happened before and I don't suspect it will happen again this or next year, either, but - it sure happens :)<p>As a similar anecdote, two days ago my Xorg server crashed. Not WM (E17) mind you, but X server. It was running continuously for about two months, was eating more and more RAM and finally, when Chromium froze and went on a RAM eating frenzy, the server crashed. It was the first time I saw X server crashing since I fought with enabling compositing in XFree on PIII 1Ghz, but still, it happened.<p>So, what I want to say is that no software can run flawlessly forever; it's just a question about how often (or how rarely) the crash (or other malfunction) is going to happen. 0.28 bluescreens per month per user is a pretty impressive feat and it's says more about how <i>good</i> than how bad W8 is.",1353106156

A lot of people who hang out here are engineers / developers who don't get a lot of exposure to that side of things.<p>Start by explaining a business 'model' which goes like this:<p><pre><code>    Revenue - Cost-to-deliver = Gross Margin\n    Gross-Margin - All-other-costs = Net Margin\n</code></pre>\nIts a sad bean countery topic, but really its not that hard to see that if your revenue is less than your burn rate you die. And your revenue has a 'unit', whether its widgets or users, each 'unit' brings you $X in revenue. And somethings are dependent on 'units' (how many servers you have, how many customer support people you need, how many twitter tokens you buy, ...) those go into your Gross Revenue calculation, because growing revenue means growing those costs and Gross Margin remains 'constant'. Then there are things like salaries for engineers, rent on the offices, replacing laptops or servers every 3 years, maintenance, janitorial, lunches. Those stay the same regardless of your revenue so your Net Margin starts low and then gets bigger as you get more revenue.<p>A business ""model"" takes the Gross Revenue, and then fractionally allocates it to those other expenses. Maybe 20% of the GM is engineering, 10% is is marketing, 10% is sales commissions, 5% is facilities, 3% is swag/giveaways, maybe 10% goes into a bonus pool that you divvy up among your best performers. The remainder is 'net revenue' or 'free cash flow'.<p>If you're a C-level executive and you don't know what every single number on your tax return means, you're running the risk of having a problem staring you in the face that you never ""see"". If you're an engineer and you see a bunch of patched together spaghetti code that is poorly documented you ""see"" that there is a huge amount of technical debt that is going to have to be paid before you can move on to V2.0 or what not. If you're looking at your taxes and you see that you're depreciation costs are of the same magnitude as your revenue you need to be able to ""see"" that a cliff is coming when you're going to need new gear and you'll have no money to buy it.<p>The biggest challenge of ""pricing"" is that sometimes you realize that you can't sell your product for what it is going to cost you to produce it. You have a choice, either innovate around the costs to make it, or put on a really good show and try to sell it to someone before the truth is out. Hard place to be but knowing your costs will inform you on whether or not your pricing makes sense. The 'best' situation is when you can sell it and your costs scale fractionally with users.

Many of the commenters here correctly noted that induction motors (IMs) are brushless and have no permanent magnets too. Each tooth on the stator can pull the rotor towards it as well as push it away. This is not so for switched reluctance motors (SRM) of this company. The stator teeth in the SRM can only pull the rotor towards it. This is the reason for its worse performance than an induction motor for any given size. Also, SRMs tend to be much louder than IMs or permanent magnet machines. As for any claims of efficiency, the way to think about it is any motor type can be made as efficient as you like so long as you don't care how big it gets. You need to compare motors of the same size to each other before you see differences between the various types. And SRMs that this company is persuing are the worst of the bunch.",1353105689

If you do a payment using the normal client, which requires the total balance from all those addresses, this will create a transaction with all those addresses as inputs.  In the Bitcoin protocol this provides unambiguous proof that the input addresses are all controlled by the same user. (With some provisos: obviously wallet services overlaid on the network complicate this; as do some other more sophisticated uses of the protocol; but in general, at a protocol level, this is true).<p>So, that then shows any passively listening third party that all those addresses were under control of a single user.  This knowledge can then be applied transitively, to consolidate ownership of large quantities of accounts. (We tried explain this in our paper: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.4524v2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.4524v2.pdf</a>  Fig 1.6)<p>What the report is probably getting at, is that an alternative thing to do, would be to instead send all the payments to a new account, in separate transactions. This would introduce a lot more ambiguity for a passive attacker - passive ownership assumptions become a lot less clearcut. You can still try make deductions, but its going to be much larger to do at large scale, and require more statistical assumptions.<p>Its not completely obvious that this is what the paper is suggesting, but thats my reading of it, and I think that makes sense.",1353105290

4796151,comment,4788659,4794364,2,0,nhaehnle,,,"He was wrong. Certainly even the bit of truth that is left in his statement is mostly misleading. Inflation is always better understood by looking at prices: What is it that leads businesses to change their prices? Why do they raise prices, and why do they get away with it?<p>For a bit of back story: What this quote of Friedman is intended to convey is the incorrect idea that there is always a causal link from an increase of the money supply to a rise in the price level. The rise in the price level is explained by a prior increase of the money supply, and this increase of the money supply is supposed to be the prime cause.<p>This is wrong on several counts: (1) there can be a causal link from the price level to an increase of the money supply, because money is endogenous; (2) as neither the real size of the economy nor the velocity of money (Q and V in MV = PQ) are constant, the price level and the money supply can move independently from each other; (3) in practice, growth in the money supply and rises in the price level are both caused <i>together</i> by other causes (such as rising cost of imports or institutionalized wage increases).<p>The most important thing to understand is that our monetary system is endogenous: How much money is out there is decided by banks and debtors. Every time a business goes to a bank and takes out a loan, the money supply grows. Every time a business pays a loan back, the money supply shrinks.<p>This explains why the causality tends to go the other way from what monetarists believe: When wages rise or the cost of inputs of production rises, businesses take out larger loans to cover their upcoming production, hence the money supply grows <i>as a consequence of</i> inflation.<p>Friedman and other monetarists are very much working from a gold standard and hence exogenous money mind set, so it is no surprise that they get this wrong: they are starting off from incorrect assumptions about how our monetary system works.<p>That is not to say that it cannot go the other direction. It can go both ways. Which is why what one should really look at is how prices are set in the economy. Since most prices are administered somehow, usually controlled by longer term contracts, you need to understand how the negotiation of those contracts works.",1353103963

Look at medicine for example. For thousands of years people knew that if you mix herb A and B and boil them for time X you get something that fights infection or helps with headache. The underlying biochemistry doesn't need to be known or understood to be able to follow the steps to get the desired outcome.<p>The same <i>might</i> hold true for the brain.

You would want to maximise revenue while managing risk. As a content provider you may not have sufficient information to figure out what the likely number of views will be in two years times as there are multiple factors you don't have much historical data on (viewer behavior, projected growth rate). Fixed bids are a lot easier to compare than comparing how you think Amazon Instant and Netflix growth rates and customer behavior will change over time.",1353103447

Message-passing between non-shared state actors is a fundamentally different animal than ""traditional"" shared-state programing, whereas what is commonly thought of as OOP (special method-call syntax, class-based coding) is just sugar on any other language without changing the way things work under the hood.<p>Certainly, using the word ""object"" was unfortunate because it distracted people whereas ""message-passing"" is more to the point, but if you see what it was supposed to achieve there really is only one thing it could mean.",1353103441

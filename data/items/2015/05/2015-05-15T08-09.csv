Their claims about tension in the design of Rust between functional and imperative features for me mostly come down to them not understanding natural consequences of the modern statically typed paradigm, or Rust&#x27;s memory model.<p>For instance, take the discussion about if expressions. They claim an if expression with a single arm returning unit is unintuitive. Firstly, we should always recognise that claims about &quot;intuitive&quot; behaviour solely depend on one&#x27;s background. This behaviour is completely intuitive to me, coming from a Racket background (which behaves the same way). It&#x27;s also a natural consequence of having to give a type to an if expression with one arm. You have two choices: the else case either returns the bottom type (which operationally means it raises some kind of error), or it returns no interesting value -- which is exactly what unit is. Since a single arm if can only be used for effect, unit is the best choice here.<p>Rust is certainly a very different language to OO-ish imperative languages that most people are familiar with. I think the author made the common mistake of expecting Rust to behave like one of these languages, and then blaming the discrepancies between their mental model and actual behaviour on the language.",1431677640

They can provide more power, which is an advantage on hills.  A typical electric cart will go <i>slow</i> on some hills that you&#x27;ll face on golf courses.  Another is that they weigh less -- on turf that means less damage, especially if it&#x27;s soggy.  Let&#x27;s not forget charging hookups, charging times, and other inconveniences -- maybe they mean you need more golf cart inventory, or more battery inventory?  I don&#x27;t know if golf cart batteries are quick-replaceable.  About half of golf courses use gas powered carts for reasons.",1431677290

But perhaps I can advise on any questions that you have about the program or running a small business in Estonia.<p>> They will run you through multiple police reports, collect fingerprints (as they explained in followup emails).<p>Yes, the details they ask are going to be similar to applying for a passport or a residency permit in most countries. They are giving out a government-approved identity document, so they are going to run checks on your identity. From the sounds of it, it seems simpler than getting an US visa, or an European biometric passport that lets you into the US without a visa.<p>> Taxation benefits are unclear<p>The main benefit is no corporate income taxes. Businesses only pay taxes when money is paid out as dividend, salary or other benefits to individuals. All income that stays in the company is not (yet) taxed.<p>The total tax rates (all different business+employee portions) are approximately 20% for dividend, and 40% for salary if the individual is also in Estonia. So not really internationally competitive for salary taxes, but reasonable for dividend.<p>But you are correct - if the money is paid out to someone outside of Estonia, things get a lot more complicated. You most likely would not need to pay Estonian social security or income taxes, but on the other hand your country will most likely tax you instead.<p>> Estonia socially and historically weren&#x27;t that much foreigners-friendly country either.<p>It is hopefully getting a lot better over time. But the average Estonian seems to have two completely separate viewpoints for &quot;foreigners&quot;:<p>* People who moved to Estonia during the Soviet occupation, and decided to stay here after it ended. They are viewed with suspicion and sometimes outright hostility, as if they were responsible for the bad things that happened in the last century, and are here waiting for a chance to repeat them.<p>* Everyone else. If you are in Estonia for business, studies, tourism, or any other reason, and know the local word for &quot;hello&quot;, you will find friendly reception.",1431676861

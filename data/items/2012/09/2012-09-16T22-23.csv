If you show any interest in programming, I highly recommend learning more. However, there comes a time when you must have a certain amount of experience. This is a profession where important things are made. Even people who should know better end up building systems that leak our sensitive personal information, or let others impersonate us.<p>I didn't say that such a person shouldn't be hired, but I certainly implied that the original question is a better indicator of their capability than the always positive keyword soup and ""years experience"" that many people slather on their rsum.<p>If ""avoiding IF-THEN spaghetti"" is all you require from contributors, fine.

4530667,comment,4527506,4528631,3,0,dsrguru,,,"I'm really glad you brought up spaced repetition since spaced repetition and the techniques described in Moonwalking with Einstein happen to be two of the items on my relatively small list of the most amazing things humans are capable of that they neglected to teach me in kindergarten. I'm sure most people on HN are unfamiliar with both, so I'd like to give a brief overview of what they are and how they work.<p>The techniques described in Moonwalking with Einstein require serious time investment up front, but allow you to cultivate a memory that rivals that of people with savantism (who incidentally tend to use the same general techniques but do so naturally). Spaced repetition doesn't produce <i>as</i> amazing results but doesn't require initial time investment and is a far more efficient method of memorizing data than conventional approaches. The only downside to spaced repetition is that most software implementations of it require daily review and don't work optimally if you miss a day (recent versions of the proprietary SuperMemo, Piotr Wozniak's own software, are supposed to be much more forgiving), but you don't need to invest much time each day.<p>So how exactly do these two memory techniques work? Spaced repetition is predicated on the notion that the longer you wait before reviewing data, the longer that information will stick in your head. That is, as long as you are able to recall the data when you review it. If you wait too long, you'll completely forget the data. So there exists an optimal length of time to wait before reviewing a piece of data, and as with the American game show The Price is Right, you can approach that optimal value by increasing your estimate, but the moment your estimate exceeds that optimal value, it becomes less useful than all possible underestimates. The goal of spaced repetition systems (SRS), such as the software programs SuperMemo, Mnemosyne, and Anki, is to adapt to the user's mind and figure out this optimal interval to wait before showing a flash card again, as opposed to conventional flash card systems that review each card every day. Not only does spaced repetition greatly increase the value of each time you review a card by committing it further into your long term memory, but it also greatly decreases the number of flash cards you need to review each day.<p>The art of memory (aka method of loci), which is the technique described in Moonwalking with Einstein, works by taking advantage of the fact that our visual and spacial memory is far better than our memory for arbitrary facts. The gist of the technique is to convert data that you want to memorize into vivid images (the funnier or cruder the better) and arrange those images at discrete points in a predefined order along a spacial layout you know well (the layout is called a ""memory palace"", but it can be your home, school, office, neighborhood, favorite video game map, etc.). To recall the data, all you have to do is retrace your steps and remind yourself what each image means. Combining this technique with spaced repetition, you can commit thousands of pieces of data to a memory palace, wait a few hours to retrace your steps to recall the information, retrace your steps again the next day, then again a few days later, then again a week later, then a month later, etc. In this way, about two or three hours distributed over 5 or so weeks (maybe with one more review the next year) will let you memorize thousands of pieces of data permanently. The stuff you can do with your mind once you know more efficient memory techniques is truly amazing.",1347835998
4530666,comment,4530194,4530194,2,0,tzs,,,"The article is describing Lloyd's Algorithm. It would be good to mention the name somewhere.<p>It would probably be a good idea to mention what to do if a cluster ends up with no points assigned at some point.<p>It should also be noted that there are other methods for choosing the initial cluster centers than choosing randomly from the data. For instance, choosing random points in the smallest d-dimensional rectangle that contains the data points (where d is the dimensionality of the space containing the data points) is popular.<p>When checking a point against each cluster center to determine which center to assign that point to you can speed things up a little by using the square of the distance rather than the distance. The saves you NK square root calculations, where N is the number of points and K is the number of clusters.",1347835913

Given that there is no equivalent of Django or Rails, and web development in clj is really about assembling a collection of libraries (Ring, Compojure/Moustache, Enlive/Hiccup etc), it is much harder for the initiate to understand how everything fits together. The fact that Rails is so opinionated also really helps the new developer become productive in a relatively short timeframe.<p>I'd imagine this would apply to just about any other language as well really.

</code></pre>
And you get this result:<p><pre><code>  ""function anonymous() { return 12; }""
</code></pre>
Notice that the expression has been converted to 12 in the function, so each call to it will just return 12 instead of converting it. That's why it is so much faster. The same is true for ""<<"", "">>"" and ""1  *  '12'""<p>I created another test where it actually do the conversion, by assigning the string to a variable and use that in each test. There parseInt is faster in Firefox, Opera, Chrome and Safari. Surprisingly it is the slowest in IE, where +str is the fastest.<p>You can find it here:
<a href=""http://jsperf.com/parse-number-from-string"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsperf.com/parse-number-from-string</a><p>Also notice:<p>* All the logical operators (~, <<, >>, |) operates internally on a 32 bit signed integer, while parseInt, Number and + operates on a 64 bit signed float.

4530556,comment,4530185,4530433,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I'll try again, starting with this:<p><i>""... something to be passionate about is the main thing I lack in a job.""</i><p>This is backwards. A job generally won't give you something to be passionate about, passion comes from <i>inside</i> of you. Passion is the thing you choose to do when you can do anything, passion is the thing you invest in when there is no obvious 'reason' for doing so, investing in your passions is its own reward.<p>Small anecdote, worked with another engineer at Sun who was struggling, and he asked me why it seemed so easy for everyone else and so hard for him. We talked about passion and its not 'easy' for someone who is passionate about something but it is 'fun' so they exude happiness digging into the problem not pain. At its root there is a attitude difference, just like people who are passionate about fitness aren't excited about doing exercise, they are being excited about how this exercise is giving them new capabilities in fitness. They look past the means and luxuriate in the ends. That is following your passion [1].<p>The engineer I knew realized his passion was helping folks get ahead in life, he was always happy seeing someone get past a challenge an on to something more fulfilling. He ended up following that passion and last time I heard was living in Mexico helping folks build sustainable communities without the stigma of 'technology backwardness.'<p>Ok so back to your observation, there are lots of 'engineering driven companies' they make all sorts of things from sex toys to intercontinental ballistic missiles. Its a wide range and 'engineering driven' doesn't say a whole lot about passion other than solving problems. But if solving problems in an engineering context is what you like to do, then you might start looking at jobs for program manager rather than engineer. I don't know of course, I'm not you. But its a way to approach your question which I suspect would get you further down the path.<p>[1] A litmus test might be, imagine you've been in a car accident and you're paralyzed from the neck down. What thing did you wish you were doing yesterday before the accident? Lots of self help books suggest pretending today is the last day of your life, what do you want to spend it doing? Etc etc. The bottom line is people with passion make a difference, and folks can tell that in an interview from a mile away if you're pursuing your passion or just marking time.",1347833685

There are many laws which do not function as they should.<p>and<p>>By itself, speeding is a victimless crime: if you hit something or someone with your car, you were doing something wrong besides just speeding. The main idea behind speed limits is to ""make criminals,"" in Rand's words. They are a tool that gives law enforcement a valid reason to pull over virtually anybody and everybody on the road. At the end of the day, the result is less respect for traffic laws and police in general, but more revenue for police departments, municipalities, and insurance companies.<p>So yes, it sounds to me like we're not limiting this to highways, but rather to the governments right to set things like speed limits and whether those limits are effective. Now, if you think that there should be a right to set speed limits in town but not on highways, we need to establish that.<p>You, yourself, included non-highways in this discussion. I respect your decision to exclude them but clearly you are limiting the scope of the discussion from what <i>you personally set it at</i>.<p>And <i>of course</i> the scope matter, the relevant facts change(i.e. the politically influenced decision to lower speed limits to 55 MPH) when you change the scope.

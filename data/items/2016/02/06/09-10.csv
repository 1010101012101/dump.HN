11047087,comment,11045412,11046896,0,0,barrkel,,,"The job I have in mind was basically implementing a subset of Excel&#x27;s sorting and filtering capabilities into a paginated table view on a SPA web page.<p>Sorting has a couple of wrinkles. When Excel sorts rows, it changes the in-memory order; its sort is also stable. That means if you sort by column C, then B, then A, you&#x27;re effectively doing &quot;order by a, b, c&quot;. Seems simple enough. But that&#x27;s not the only wrinkle in this problem.<p>Not all sortable columns are in the same table. If you do something naive like &quot;select x.* , y.* from x join y [...] where [...] order by x.a, y.b limit 10 offset 20000&quot;, you&#x27;re doing too much work - you&#x27;re sorting a wide result set. It&#x27;s normally better to do your pagination in a subquery and join against it, like this:<p><pre><code>    select x.*, y.* from x join y [...] join (\n      select x.id from x join y [...] where [...]\n      order by x.a, y.b limit 10 offset 20000\n    ) f on f.id = x.id\n    order by x.a, y.b\n</code></pre>\nDepending on the body of the where clause, you want to join the minimum set of tables to include just enough data to evaluate the page of ids - every join has a cost.<p>The body of the where clause is another story, it&#x27;s pretty much entirely arbitrary. The user may choose to filter on any column, just like Excel autofilter. Creating good indexes up front isn&#x27;t feasible - you don&#x27;t know how many columns to include in any one index, they take time to create and they&#x27;re not free in disk storage either. And the filtered columns span multiple tables; the final result set may contain several hundred columns across all these tables.<p>So what I did is take the criteria - the filter clause, which might look something like this:<p><pre><code>    (and (or (eq (field &#x27;x.f1&#x27;) &quot;foo&quot;)\n             (eq (field &#x27;y.f2&#x27;) &quot;bar&quot;))\n         (between (field &#x27;m.timestamp&#x27;) &quot;date1&quot; &quot;date2&quot;))\n</code></pre>\nAnd turn it into a where clause. I analyze the filter tree to determine the minimum set of joins required to access all the fields needed by the filter and sorting criteria. I can then put that into a subquery to join against.<p>There are more wrinkles. To give a good experience, we need to populate a dropdown of potential filter values, like Excel autofilter. Potential filter values need to be filtered themselves - we only display filter values for that are potentially visible given the current filter. They also need to be searchable, because there may be millions of them. And they may include joins, like when you want to filter by tags or some other 1:N style relation, like row:tags. There are a bunch of different shapes to the different queries, but there are common composable underlyers to them.<p>All the above runs on mostly unindexed tables - we&#x27;re relying on pure query compute performance within the designed data limits (less than 3 million rows). Sub-millisecond query response times aren&#x27;t the goal here; we&#x27;re supporting the user doing reasonably complex data manipulation operations with worst case performance measured in single-digit seconds.<p>(This is all in MySQL, because reasons that include business model constraints.)",1454750128

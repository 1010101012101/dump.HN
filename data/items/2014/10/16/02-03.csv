8463107,comment,8462829,8462829,0,0,StefanKarpinski,,,"Please stop adding features to C++ and standardize an ABI already. The lack of an ABI is why it&#x27;s impossible to call C++ libraries without an entire C++ compiler – and it generally requires generating mountains of wrapper code a la SWIG – which is then called with the C ABI. The lack of an ABI is why dynamic libraries use C for writing extensions instead of C++: C++ can literally only be called by C++ (and in fact only by the same C++ compiler).",1413428280

But the question at hand isn&#x27;t using a dynamically vs. a statically typed language, it is, <i>given</i> that you are in a statically typed language, is a Java-style one sufficient?<p>Indeed, this is one of the benefits of dynamically typed languages: you&#x27;re not restricted to any particular type discipline; you don&#x27;t have to worry that the type system of the language you&#x27;re in is too restrictive.<p>OTOH, if you want it to be easy to write reusable code, having static typeclasses with type inference can be quite useful. You <i>could</i> write a monad transformer stack in a dynamically typed language, but you can&#x27;t always write code that&#x27;s generic across any monad without explicitly passing around an object that represents the monad in question.

8463098,comment,8459205,8462319,0,0,lstamour,,,"As I understand it, the proof is how tightly they pack the pixels. If you need a stronger backlight to illuminate the screen, and more power to push all the pixels, it stands to reason that a more detailed screen e.g. 1080p instead of 720p, in the same form factor, is going to use considerably more battery. It&#x27;s part of the reason why the iPhone 6 does better in battery life tests without gimmicks to extend the battery life as the phone hits Low Battery warnings, the screen&#x27;s resolution is just over 720p instead of the Nexus 5&#x27;s comparable 1080p screen. This difference is highlighted by how the Nexus 5 had a 2300 mAh battery while the iPhone 6 has merely 1810 mAh, 20% smaller. In battery tests for the 1080p Nexus 5, under L, it lasts roughly 8 hours. The iPhone 6 gets about the same playing movies, maybe two hours longer otherwise.

Some ideas: audit / upgrade our node dependencies, replace npm-lockdown with npm-shrinkwrap, try to get Persona running locally and file documentation bugs about what did / didn&#x27;t work, open a random .js or .ejs file and see if you can make it less verbose or complex.

In 2000&#x27;ish, I decided to join some yahoo portfolio challenge and threw the initial pool into Geocities and jumped into a high tier spot.<p>Junior year of college, someone in the dorm went about running a portfolio challenge, and my roommate and I slowly realized the way to win was volatility, and I eventually found an earnings report calendar on Yahoo that was essentially our rosetta stone to winning, because the guy&#x27;s system let people buy in after hours at market close prices. Wake up a few minutes before market open, search the earnings calendar for stocks up in after hours trading, and place your entire portfolio in one with a huge earnings surprise. I think someone else was front running the guy&#x27;s system by using a feed 5-10 minutes ahead of the Yahoo API he was using, to find a series of 1 percent per five minutes trades.<p>In retrospect, these sorts of &#x27;whoever has the most in 3 months wins!&#x27; competitions teach novices how to gamble and cheat, rather than allocate assets prudently.

I&#x27;ll continue to look, but I&#x27;ll explain my experience in the mean time.  Probably at the cost of some karma without explanation ;)  But here goes anyway.<p>Originally I was looking for a reddit mobile app and tried Alien Blue and iAlien, not the &quot;pro&quot; version of either, but I chose iAlien, used the trial for a bit, <i>then</i> bought the pro version.<p>At some point there was an &quot;upgrade&quot; link inside the app that pointed to a new, renamed app with an explanation that &quot;someone&quot; had asked Apple to pull the original iAlien app (based on the name?  going from memory here) so the developer released the app under a new name, but, of course, anyone who had purchased iAlien pro would have to re-buy the new app.<p>A comment either under the original iAlien or under the new name claimed that the developer had pulled this before.  So I was reluctant to buy the new app thinking that this might be an endless cycle.<p>Instead, I purchased Alien Blue pro and have been happy since with it.  So happy that I can&#x27;t remember why I originally chose iAlien in the first place.  I could have been more features in the trial for all I know at this point.<p>I&#x27;ll try and see if I can reconstruct what I originally went through with links, but if anyone disputes what I&#x27;m saying, you can down vote me, but please explain or clarify, I&#x27;d really appreciate it and it will probably spur an interesting dialog.<p>EDIT: here are a couple links that I remember reading and changing my mind about iAlien and switching to Alien Blue:<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlue/comments/1wk2n3/the_ialien_developer_is_scamming_users_and/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlue/comments/1wk2n3/the_ialien...</a><p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/ialien/comments/1wbtqe/ialien_has_been_removed_from_app_store_please/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/ialien/comments/1wbtqe/ialien_has_be...</a>",1413427309

Cost of a false negative is at a minimum the time and expense of contact-tracking 132 people who flew with her, the cost to the airline of taking the plane out of service (which they&#x27;ve already done), and a severe drop of public confidence in the CDC. The pane made 5 more flights before it was taken out of service: <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-frontier-airline-ebola-patient-20141015-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-frontier-airline-ebola...</a><p>Now, the chances that anyone else on the same flight got infected is very very low, close to zero. That&#x27;s even more true for the people who took other flights on the same plane, even the people who were sitting in the same seat that she sat in - though it&#x27;s non-zero, as I doubt the airline disinfects the armrests and fold-down trays after every single flight. But just doing the contact tracking and being prepared to field telephone and email inquiries from all the other people who traveled on that plane with and after the nurse did is going to consume a bunch of CDC resources that could be better spent elsewhere.<p>Meanwhile, it seems that staff at the hospital were not wearing adequate protective gear for the first 2 days after Duncan was admitted until they got a positive blood test for Ebola: <a href=""http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2014/10/presbyterian-workers-wore-no-protective-gear-for-two-days-while-treating-ebola-patient.html/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2014/10/presbyterian-work...</a><p>False positives are bad but IMHO they&#x27;re a lot cheaper than false negatives.

I went from small to large, and while I thought the Note 2 had fantastic specs, it was too unwieldy for me and I decided to downsize to the Nexus 5. I still find the Nexus 5 a bit unwieldy with one handed use, but it&#x27;s at least possible. Which brings me to my current conclusion: I want a smaller phone which doesn&#x27;t give up too much in the screen resolution. Which brings me to my question: What makes ideal specs for you? Here&#x27;s what I want, but cannot seem to find (something is always missing):<p>* Size: 4.9&quot; screen<p>* Resolution: 1080p (it&#x27;s really hard to find any phones this size with this resolution, which is disappointing because the PPI is possible, especially given the quad HD resolutions being slapped on phones now).<p>* SD expansion slot: One thing I really liked about the Note 2 that the Nexus phones don&#x27;t have. I could upgrade with a 64G SD card which didn&#x27;t cost much. 32G can fill up pretty quickly with videos and photos and it&#x27;s annoying Google has a philosophy which shuns SD cards.<p>* Battery: At least 2600mAmp (should last at least one day).<p>* Stock android: No bloatware and no touch-wiz. This isn&#x27;t as important as the other considerations though.<p>* CPU: This doesn&#x27;t matter too much to me. 99% of what I do doesn&#x27;t need a latest generation processor<p>* Memory: 2G is fine. Memory again isn&#x27;t the main thing that&#x27;s bothering me about the current android offerings.<p>What really bothers me is no-one is catering to this market segment and the trend is increasingly into the phablet market.",1413426121

They don&#x27;t view a system of laws as an evolving structure to balance rights and harms, they view the legal code as a formal statement of society&#x27;s shared moral standards.<p>So if drug use is considered immoral (which, keep in mind, has been the standard mainstream message since before almost all of us were born), that philosophy would imply that society has a moral duty to declare that publicly and to punish those who practice or promote immorality. (And naturally, to address your last point, violence done by the societally approved defenders of morality (i.e. the police) is more acceptable than violence done by people actively breaking the rules and thus the common moral code.)<p>I won&#x27;t swear that I have any of that exactly right, but it&#x27;s the sense that I&#x27;ve gotten from many conversations and articles about this sort of thing. I pretty strongly disagree with their premise about the purpose of laws, but within their framework I think their behavior is reasonably sensible.",1413425038

That is why I agree it should be just one of many steps you ought to take if you care about anonymity. I never said this is a plug-and-play solution to internet anonymity. Still, hiding your IP address is one important factor in anonymity and probably the biggest use-case for Tor. Using a separate, dedicated device for this purpose makes it practically impossible for your IP address to leak e.g. because of a browser exploit.<p>Case in point, when the FBI busted users of child porn sites in 2013, they used a Zero-day in Firefox [1] to leak the users IP addresses. This would not have worked for users with a device like this. They could&#x27;ve tried to gather evidence through other means using this exploit, but that&#x27;s definitely harder than simply opening a network connection and would only work in cases where the exploit could access anything that would identify the user.<p>(Obviously I&#x27;m not unhappy about child porn users getting busted, but I thought it would serve as a good example.)<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2013/mfsa2013-53.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2013/mfsa2013-53.h...</a>",1413424982

Ok, I shouldn&#x27;t complain, but I originally chose the iAlien app only to run into the scam that that developer put on by claiming a takedown based on the name by Alien Blue (IIRC, I&#x27;ll try and provide a source if someone requests it) requiring users to buy the new app.  I was really happy with iAlien, but I wasn&#x27;t going to pay the extortion for the &quot;new&quot; app.<p>Only about 6 months ago I bought Alien Blue + Pro, now I have to do it again.<p>It appears that if I get it this week I will probably be able to save $4, so that&#x27;s good, but I feel a bit scammed by the iAlien developer that I don&#x27;t trust some of these apps anymore.  I do trust that reddit is a good thing, so I&#x27;m probably set from here on out.<p>And, in the end, I know it&#x27;s only $8, but I hate being scammed, it&#x27;s the principle.<p>Alien Blue is a good app so I&#x27;m happy for Jase the developer and I forget why I originally chose iAlien over Alien Blue now, but hopefully we get some good advancements in the mobile interface which is my primary means of accessing reddit.<p>EDIT: Adding links to controversy here as well:<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlue/comments/1wk2n3/the_ialien_developer_is_scamming_users_and/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlue/comments/1wk2n3/the_ialien...</a><p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/ialien/comments/1wbtqe/ialien_has_been_removed_from_app_store_please/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/ialien/comments/1wbtqe/ialien_has_be...</a>",1413424935

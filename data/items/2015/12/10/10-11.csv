But you can make decisions based on the information that your information is incomplete. A sort of &#x27;bias towards inaction&#x27; in those cases in which the action would be irreversible.<p>Consider the death penalty. You may think that&#x27;s morally right to apply the death penalty to, say, mass murderers. You may also, without contradiction, decide that this should never be done in practice. The reasoning being that it would require infallibility on the part of the persons deciding to apply such punishment.<p>So you don&#x27;t even say &quot;the highest moral imperative is that thou shall not kill&quot;. There might very well be cases where the best moral decision would be to kill someone under some &#x27;higher&#x27; ideal you know nothing of. But you can still simply say &quot;I do not trust my moral judgement to the point were I&#x27;d take another&#x27;s life because of such judgement, no matter how righteous my judgement feels to me&quot;.<p>Of course, you are also unlike to trust any other person to make such determinations, either. How to try and dissuade others from taking actions that you don&#x27;t consider acceptable, without resorting to actions for which you know you are not qualified to make the moral call, is a whole other matter.",1449745043

Or old clients recommends my work. Friends usually indicates my work too.\n- Internet Marketing myself and my business on Google Adwords and SEO.<p>How do you price projects?\n- That´s hard. Too many ways. None is the RIGHT way, i think. Usually i charge R$75,00 to R$100,00 hour (like US$35.00/hour). It´s even harder to predict how much time will be spent in a project. Experience helps a lot here.<p>Do you buy WordPress template?\n- Yes, for small projects or projects that don´t demands much customization.\n- No, for bigger projects (because i can spend money with my team (i have a frontend designer, a backend coder and a marketing assistant). For projects that´s demand too much customization (startups, business ideas and like) it´s better to code your theme from scratch.<p>How do you price SEO and maintenance?\n- The client indicates his monthly budget for the task (site maintenance, for example).

Architecture becoming art pour l&#x27;art.<p>I completely agree. Unless constrained, software developers will entertain themselves with architecture stuff ad libitum. But this is one problem; the other - a full-blown, bigger one - is truly knowing the real-world problem.<p>> I don&#x27;t see the point of the article being that every software developer becomes a fully-fledged UX guy, but understands the context in which the system is going to be used and not get lost in the technical rabbit hole.<p>The premise is a noble one, and correct IMO. But, as above, truly knowing the real-world problem is hell. We can&#x27;t really hope to solve the technical rabbit hole <i>just</i> by focusing in the real-world, or <i>simply</i> assume that we know it.<p>Software developers won&#x27;t understand the real-world context, most of the times. They aren&#x27;t trained to do so. Most of the times, companies won&#x27;t help: organization keeps software developers very far from customers. Hell, I&#x27;ll say it: many software developers even lack the basic empathy skills to understand the user. Their model of the software is the implementation model, not the usage model. And many times they&#x27;re too stubborn, and talk very cheap regarding users and usage: software developers say &quot;this is what the user wants&quot; as cheaply I say &quot;the sky is blue&quot;. But the thing is that &quot;what the user wants&quot; is not that obvious; the only obvious thing is the mis/preconceptions we have.",1449744543

10709879,comment,10697759,10703786,0,0,tripzilch,,,"> I&#x27;m not a smoker, but I&#x27;m all for every smoker around me converting to e-cigs, and even at the &quot;risk&quot; of having some non-smokers start e-cigs it&#x27;s really a no contest: if some e-cig flavourings are unhealthy, investigate and regulate those, but please please do not stop the transition which is great for absolutely everybody.<p>You forgot one group, although my guess is that if it&#x27;s a significant number (I just have anecdata), we&#x27;ll hear about it soon enough. With all these parties holding interest, they&#x27;ll be up to their noses in statistics.<p>It&#x27;s the group of smokers that are trying to make a healthy life-decision, trying to quit their addiction[0], to quit smoking, but relapse because obviously electronic cigarettes keep both the nicotine addiction and the habit going.<p><i>None</i> of the people I know who tried to switch to e-cigs (for health, or any reasons actually) did not relapse to regular cigarettes. Starts with just one, for the flavour (because it does taste better, really does) and after a few weeks you&#x27;ll never see the e-cig again. I&#x27;ll ask around to see if any of them still even use the e-cig at all, maybe at home, but I kind of doubt it.<p>Source: Am smoker and therefore hang out with other smokers outside a lot of the time. I can think of 4 or 5 people I know for which the above story holds, and truly not anybody that permanently switched to e-cigs, or went from e-cigs to full quit.<p>Not even for half a year or so--which I would otherwise (without e-cigs) consider having &quot;quit&quot; to the extent that keeping it up after that is much more likely.<p>So among my peers, people &quot;switching&quot; to e-cigs, can basically expect less than half a year of clean lungs before they relapse. Any health benefits of that short period goes up in smoke.<p>That&#x27;s what I don&#x27;t like about e-cigs, it&#x27;s like twitter-activism, it wastes people&#x27;s will on something they think is helping, but really just lulls them into a false sense of effort.<p>Another piece of anecdata: I know a lot more (than 4 or 5) people that actually managed to quit smoking. Now some of them didn&#x27;t get addicted &quot;real bad&quot; (some people are just less sensitive to addiction), but some of them did, even relapsed some times, but keep on battling. Especially that last group, if they had switched to e-cigs instead, would be back inhaling burned leaves in no time.<p>But I don&#x27;t know how significant these experiences are. Maybe e-cigs will help further the social stigma of smoking, the unusualness of it, therefore in the end creating and cultivating an environment in which smokers can more easily kick their habit. But a method to quit smoking, it is not. Especially I have personally, not seen any heavy smoker / addict get any expected health benefits from them.<p>So if e-cigs are good, they&#x27;re only for &quot;the greater good&quot;, I would never ever recommend a smoker that wants to &quot;switch&quot; to e-cigs for their health. &quot;Just quit&quot;, I will tell them, e-cigs are just a temporary stop-gap to feel like you&#x27;re &quot;doing something good&quot;, while in the mean-time keeping your actual addiction alive and kicking. Even <i>trying</i> quitting for real and failing, seems IMO better than that (at least you&#x27;ll gain experience in battling your willpower).<p>[0] which is <i>hard</i>, and I&#x27;ll just say that if you haven&#x27;t experienced such addiction (and even many smokers and ex-smokers have not), you probably underestimate how it can grind will to dust",1449742677

The faster the gas flows, the more kinetic energy there is, the less potential is left, thus the object is pushed with lower force.\nIf an object shaped such that gas around opposing faces flows in different speeds moves through the gas, opposing faces are pushed with different force and you get lift. The higher the speed, the more total energy is converted to kinetic energy, the less potential energy is left, the higher the force differential. Thus, the faster the object goes, the more lift it generates. That explains minimal take-off speed of an airplane.<p>This is by no means scientifically rock solid, but gives really good layman explanation.",1449742092

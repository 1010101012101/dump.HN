117891,comment,117294,117860,0,0,timr,,,"My post was based on my own knowledge of the recruiting process (and the background of many fellow grad students) a  top-tier school:<p>1) GPA and GRE scores are typically the basis for an include/exclude decision to filter a large pool of applicants down to a smaller pool.  They don't typically play a primary role in determining the <i>ranking</i> of the candidates after this step.  That's a far more holistic (read: subjective) decision.<p>2) In terms of #1, committees tend to weight both GPA and GRE equally, with a slight preference given to the GRE, because it is the only direct quantitative comparison available between all applicants.<p>But this debate is mostly navel-gazing, because admissions committees are famously capricious;  the <i>exact</i> method used depends on the members of the committee, and their particular biases.  The only point I'm trying to make here is that your chances to get admitted to a top-tier school aren't necessarily higher if you went to MIT as an undergrad.  That's a myth that is dearly loved -- by MIT undergrads.<p>(And by the way?  Two seconds of googling tells me that you're wrong about MIT and the GRE:<p><a href=""http://web.mit.edu/admissions/graduate/requirements/testing_req.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.mit.edu/admissions/graduate/requirements/testing_...</a>)",1203299584

It's simply a product of this computer and the programming that we call the brain. It's more an illusion of consciousness, but I would have a hard time actually proving that and will save it for another post.<p>With just a copy, there was never any type of physical connection linking the two. They are two separate physical entities, which would include the consciousness. An analogy is two identical computers running the same software. However, if they were one entity at some point and things were gradually turned off in the old brain, I think this would preserve what we call consciousness because our brain, including the copy which would mimic the brain, is very malleable and adaptable. It would transition into the new system. An analogy here is gradually replacing the parts in a computer. You upgrade the RAM, upgrade the motherboard, the processor, etc. You even image the hard drive to a new drive, but keep it in the same case and running the same OS and software. At what point is it no longer the same computer?<p>With creating a copy of the brain, if the two are connected and then the connection is simply cut, then I don't think the new copy would actually be the same. If it's gradual, then yes. I'm not sure if I can say where the line actually is though.",1203297032

117860,comment,117294,117756,0,0,mercurio,,,"I think we possibly have a different understanding of what is a lesser or second tier school. I based my opinion on the original poster's response to pg's comment, where he states that his cs program is like ""trade school"". I doubt that a 4.0 from such a program would count for much in comparison to an applicant from a top CS department.<p>As for your anecdotal example, could it not be that the other factors were the deciding ones in this case (like the student from the lesser school having much stronger recommendations or published a paper)? In any case, all I meant by making up this 3.6/4.0 example was that the school matters too.<p>If I read you correctly, you also seem to be saying that GRE scores are more important than GPA. This is not true at all. In fact GRE scores count for very little compared to your GPA (which counts less than recommendations and research). Remember that we are discussing admission to top-tier schools. MIT does not even consider the GRE in their admission procedure.<p>Also, what makes you assume that I'm talking from a hypothetical perspective? At my undergrad school, I have personally known about 50 people who've applied and gone to grad school, and GPA correlates very strongly with the ranking of the department they joined. Since then these views have been confirmed by the faculty (including my advisor) that I have talked to at my grad school.<p>In any case, we have our grad recruiting weekend coming up next week, and I'll do some field research and report back :)",1203296907

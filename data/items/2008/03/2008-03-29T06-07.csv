That information is guarded by a user-specific session key, so the app would have to store each user's session key on the server (or have already cached the response) for it to work. A really insecure application could probably be coerced into making other API calls as well, like sending notifications or uploading photos.<p>I guess in that case Facebook might want to look in to providing some vulnerability testing tools to developers, or maybe running tests for them to find vulnerabilities. It's definitely a hard problem.",1206773989

It frequently won't be in public, or between strangers. And it runs a danger of polluting the main discussion. Any personal help is strictly a separate issue than which of the original ideas is true -- the person being helped could still have been right.",1206773978

149286,comment,148773,149245,0,0,xlnt,,,"As I understand it, you are proposing a sort of evolutionary psychology theory. Humans personalities today are certain ways because of selection pressure on genes.<p>I think that sort of theory is mistaken because there has not been significant selection pressure on human genes recently. More specifically, there hasn't been selection pressure on human genes since around the time that humans first got personalities. So I don't think genetic evolution was able to have much influence on our personalities.<p>The reason there wasn't selection pressure on genes is that any survival needs could be filled faster and better by ideas, so genetic differences didn't have much chance to matter.",1206773337

The fact that lenders 1) didn't have to suffer the consequences of making bad loans and 2) financially profited from making those bad loans suggests that they had an interest in seeing relaxed underwriting standards.  For this reason, I can't help but think that the author is pointedly ignoring the main contributing factor to the mortgage disaster.",1206772143

149263,comment,148542,148865,0,0,dbreunig,,,"Agreed. (Plus Admob is amazing. We see fantastic results with them) My one rebut to your Google-Yahoo metaphor is that there is less specific input with a phone, it's more contextual. With a keyboard and mouse its easy to navigate the web, but a number pad (or touch) and limited screen space means your navigation takes a hit and relevance becomes all the more important. For that reason the WAP deck is still clinging on and even players like Google and Yahoo are striving for a portal strategy in the mobile world.",1206772068

The more specific the boxes of data in a network are, the more relevant they are to the end-user.<p>My problem right now is that FriendFeed is nothing more than a grand pipe. It really holds no content, instead it creates a window to view content elsewhere. There are problems with this. One of the big ones is the feedback loop that emerges with heavy users (I twitt, which goes to friendfeed and tumblr, where it goes back to friend feed. same with delicious...) The second problem is that FF relies on data from outside sources: if delicious or FB turns off the flow what can FF do?<p>I guess my frustration lies in people vesting in FF's potential. It hasn't done anything terribly novel (though useful) yet. I'm waiting for the 'wow' moment. Something anyone can experience without having lots of early-adopter, data-exhausting friends to see the immediate benefit.

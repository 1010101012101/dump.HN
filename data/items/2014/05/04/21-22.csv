The sole legal purpose and effect of Prop 8 was to strip equal protection from gay people as regards to marriage.

You can try to justify that, but pretending like that&#x27;s not what went on mainly makes you look willfully ignorant.<p>I don&#x27;t have a black-and-white, scorched-earth view of this. I have a lot of compassion for the people who find themselves on the wrong side of a social change.

Does Google disable online tracking for school users? If not, Google must be rubbing their hands with glee at all the data they&#x27;re collecting.<p>Yes, I know that Google doesn&#x27;t do nefarious things with the data they collect. That doesn&#x27;t mean we shouldn&#x27;t scrutinise the way they track online behaviour so relentlessly. Even printing to your desktop printer in ChromeOS is recorded by Google because all print jobs go through Google&#x27;s cloud print service.<p>If people thought their Linux, Windows or Mac Operating System was constantly logging their actions and sending back the details to the OS vendor, they&#x27;d be angry. When companies ask for app usage data they do so on the promise that it&#x27;s anonymous and they tell you what they are recording and why. Google tell you nothing and you&#x27;re not even anonymous (you have to sign in with a Google account to use Chrome OS.

I&#x27;m just thinking out loud, so bear with me.<p>Satire and parody and other forms of creative provocation can be intensely vital things. But they don&#x27;t work on HN. We could speculate about why, but empirically it&#x27;s a property of the system: certain things reliably make HN less interesting, and high-signal provocation isn&#x27;t possible here. It just leads to noise, which leads to more noise.<p>HN&#x27;s rules aren&#x27;t about propriety—they&#x27;re about trying to stave off lameness. HN is an experiment in trying to remain interesting, so anything whose effects, compounded over time, make the site less interesting counts as bad.<p>It took me a long time to figure this out in my own posts. I hate dreary mediocrity, so I&#x27;d try to make comments that were interesting rather than lukewarm. I slowly learned that, no matter how &quot;interesting&quot; they seemed to me when I wrote them, provocation that leads to noise only lowers the quality of the discourse.<p>We&#x27;re not demanding that people behave themselves for convention&#x27;s sake—that would be tedious and inevitably cause a backlash. Rather, it&#x27;s an optimization problem: given this system called HN, what will make it more interesting and less lame over time? Whatever the answer is, it doesn&#x27;t have to do with the quality of individual comments but with their systemic effects.<p>The spirit in which we&#x27;re asking people to work on this is not a finger-wagging one.

Instead, Tor connections are plain-old IP connections from random public IPs.

A hidden service might not have a <i>published</i> IP address, but it must have one that you <i>could</i>, potentially, connect to over the plain internet, in order for the proximate Tor node to it (what would be called an &quot;exit node&quot; if it were a plain site) to be able to talk to it.<p><i>In theory,</i> you could hack on the Tor client so that clients and servers did an SIP negotiation prior to connecting on the desired port. You&#x27;d then run something on the host which would act like a port-knocking daemon, temporarily allowing new connections on a port only in response to a request from the Tor client, and only to the SIP peer in that message.<p>(Or, Tor <i>could</i> just present itself like a network interface, giving each N-proxied-peer a virtual IP that changes whenever it regenerates its identity. &quot;Hidden service&quot; connections would be regular IP-to-IP communication. For &quot;public&quot; connections, exit nodes would need to be running SOCKS proxies, and then there could be an anycast IP address that picked a proxied-exit-node at random.

We wasted trillions of dollars, a small part of which could have funded human race saving science.<p>Of course population effects carbon output.

This happens no matter how many times you reinforce that asking questions is the only way to learn, its human nature to a certain extent.<p>My perspective, from a bootstrapped pre-seed post-launch startup, is that early on you want people that can drive forward with you, that can push you, not people you have to pull along with you. We&#x27;ve kept our junior dev because he&#x27;s motivated, passionate, and has potential. But I&#x27;d be lying if I said he doesn&#x27;t hinder our speed",1399237566

7695796,comment,7694795,7694795,52,0,tokenadult,,,"First I read all the comments already posted here. Then I read the fine article from beginning to end. This is a good article, and well worth a read. I am old enough to remember the kind of reporting that was done about Japan in the English-language press back when the book <i>Japan as Number One</i>[1] had just been published. Japan used to look unstoppable in the same way that China looks world-beating to many people now. But Japan&#x27;s &quot;lost decade&quot; of minimal economic growth and declining soft power in the world has lasted a lot longer than just one decade.<p>Japan in the 1980s already had significant advantages that China still lacks in the 2010s. First of all, it had a political system with actual elections that weren&#x27;t wholly rigged. (The political system in Japan has opened up more since then, but even thirty years ago it was well ahead of where China&#x27;s political system is now.) Second, Japan had a free press and unfettered access to foreign reporters and foreign news media for decades by the 1980s. China still doesn&#x27;t have either of those information channels for correcting problems in sufficient degree. Third, although primary education in China is quite good in urban areas, good primary education in China is still not as pervasive nationwide as it was in Japan by the 1980s. That&#x27;s illustrated in part by how few people in China (compared to Japan) are even conversant in the national language. Barely more than half the population is conversant in standard Mandarin Chinese.[2]<p>China is at risk. The &quot;socialism with Chinese characteristics&quot; (中国特色社会主义) economic policy it officially now has cannot be sustained. It looks like it has been growing rapidly in recent years for some of the same reasons that Spain looked like it was growing rapidly a decade ago--a housing bubble. The inevitable correction that has to happen in the investment markets in China may not bring about a recession, but it can&#x27;t help but bring about a change of investment priorities that may make China look less amazing for a while. China will really rise to world prominence when its common people enjoy free and fair elections, a free press, and good educational opportunity all over the country, something I hope they experience sooner rather than later. Meanwhile, I&#x27;m actually more optimistic about India during my lifetime.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Japan-Number-One-Lessons-America/dp/1583484108"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Japan-Number-One-Lessons-America/dp/15...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-23975037"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-23975037</a><p><a href=""http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-03/07/content_5812838.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-03/07/content_5812838...</a>",1399237529

7695776,comment,7695621,7695621,10,0,exratione,,,"You have to be very careful when you say &quot;reverses aging.&quot; That is a very different thing from &quot;reverses a couple of measurable aspects associated with aging.&quot; In the former case you are making an assertion that will immediately lead you to having to define the cause and mechanisms of aging and defend your point that it is, as a process, reversed - and the definition of aging is a contentious topic at the present time. But the press is lazy and in search of clicks, etc, etc.<p>The mainstream of the aging research community theorizes on the basis of mountainous evidence that aging is accumulated damage. What that damage consists of is pretty much settled, but there is a lot of argumentation over how it all hooks together, what is important, what is primary versus secondary, and how in detail it connects to visible pathologies of aging.<p>Outside that mainstream, the present day accepted heresy, in the sense that the minority population of heretics are engaged with rather than cast out of the cathedral, is that aging is an evolved genetic program. It is a selected adaptation and where there is damage that damage is a consequence of epigenetic changes, not the cause of them. There are factions within this heresy too, and a lot of argumentation. If you want to learn more, look for the hyperfunction theory of aging and related thoughts as representative of the field. [1]<p>The damage view of epigenetic and signaling changes in tissues that occur with aging is that these changes are reactions to damage. Altering them may lead to short term benefits and be worthy of use as treatments but that doesn&#x27;t do anything about the underlying damage - which will grow and kill you. In the case of stem cell decline with aging, this process is thought to be a cancer suppression mechanism, and thus forcing all the dormant stem cells back to work is going to mean cancer everywhere. Equally it may turn out that evolution has produced an overcompensation and some of the benefits of doing this might be effectively free. The fastest way to find out is to conduct animal studies in something other than mice (which are little cancer factories and have telomere dynamics that are very dissimilar to that of humans).<p>In contrast the programmed aging view is that reversing signaling and epigenetic changes is exactly reversal of aging, and is thus a great thing to be doing and we should be making full steam ahead on this front. I think they are wrong, and that the balance of evidence clearly points in the other direction, but as I said this is a heresy with enough advocates that they are not just ignored.<p>(Bizarrely, most of that portion of the mainstream who work towards enhancing longevity and slowing aging actually spend their time on potential treatments that make much more sense as goals for programmed aging enthusiasts. Look at sirtuin or calorie restriction mimetic work - all about altering protein levels and signals. All too few researchers take the sensible approach of looking for means of damage repair. But that&#x27;s a whole different topic. I blame regulation of medicine as a force steering research into marginal channels).<p>Anyway, on to the heterochronic parabiosis, which is what you call the linking of circulatory systems in two individuals, one old, one young. This has been used for some years as a way of studying what might be going on in old tissues, especially in connection with the decline in stem cell tissue maintenance activity that leads to organ dysfunction and death. The end goal is to figure out the differences and use that knowledge to produce the part of the complete map of the molecular biology of the progression of aging that covers tissue signaling - most researchers in the field have no declared interest in doing anything other than looking at what is going on.<p>Along the way, however, someone will produce prospective treatments based on identifying signals to stem cells involved in the choice between activity and quiescence. No-one is going to be shifting blood around as a basis for treatments between young and old when you can instead figure out what exactly it is in the blood that is causing changes - this is a change likely to occur in the stem cell transplant field also, in which much of the benefits seem to depend on the alteration of signals caused by the transplanted cells rather than any cell maintenance they are doing directly. Why sling cells around if you can just manufacture proteins that have the same beneficial effects?<p>One of the signals is apparently GDF11, which has been explored for a couple of years now. [2] It is interesting to see that it is more general than simply localized to heart tissue. Given the large number of quite different stem cell populations in the body it would be unexpected to find much in the way of commonality between the signaling systems that they use. Apparently there is some commonality after all. Though I wouldn&#x27;t hold out for much more. In general I&#x27;m expecting the exploration of cell signaling to be every bit as complicated as the hunt-and-peck approach taken to finding ways to interfere with cancer: a lot of proteins, different in most tissues.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3455862/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3455862/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2013.04.015"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2013.04.015</a>",1399237204

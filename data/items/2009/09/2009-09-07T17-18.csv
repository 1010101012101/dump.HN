6.) How to get the headlight in Cleveland<p>I was stuck - it seemed that I needed something ""extra"" to solve any one of these puzzles.

No gray (or any other colors besides black & white), and thus no gamma. The earliest Mac for which gamma would have had any meaning was the Macintosh II, introduced in 1987, and that's 22 years ago, not 25.

For example, some programmers have more bugs assigned to them because they care more about fixing things. People know this, so when they want something fixed they will try to assign it accordingly. If you only look at the metric, you won't be able to distinguish this case from a bad programmer who generates more bugs.<p>It's well known that metrics like this don't work. The moment you settle on one, everybody will begin optimizing for that (instead of, say, getting their job done). This inevitably leads to unintended side-effects.<p>Your best bet, assuming you're a manager who isn't working on the program directly, is to pay a lot of personal attention to what's happening on your team. Over time, you'll notice patterns.<p>There is a related pitfall I've seen many people fall into: watch out for the case where someone <i>looks</i> like a star performer because he's cranking out shoddy work. This guy often becomes the manager's favorite because he seems to get features done quickly, when what's really happening is he's getting them half-done and making a mess in the process. Worse, truly good programmers then compensate by taking time to clean up this guy's messes, which makes them appear less productive. One bad programmer like this can easily suck up the value of half a dozen good ones. The solution is to make sure not to take things at face value, but to watch carefully to see what effects someone's work is having on the product and team as a whole. This is hard but doable; everything that's going on in the code is ultimately visible at the human level if you know how to read it.",1252342983

A successful language is a way bigger beast than you started out with.  Perrone's advice about getting feedback is crucial.  Point 5, understanding the theory is mandatory.  If you dont, you are wasting everybody's time.  However, it is very useful to do a throwaway language to develop your understanding of the theory.<p>Point 7, dont create new syntax for old semantics, is worth remembering, unless you have a significant simplification.  In fact taking an old language and making it simpler is a very good excuse for a new language.<p>One thing not mentioned in the article is the importance of libraries.  A new language doesnt have a lot of chance for success if users have to write everything from scratch.

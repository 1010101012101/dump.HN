8209234,comment,8206982,8206982,5,0,BoppreH,,,"Great article, but I think I&#x27;m missing something. Several times through it I thought: &quot;ok, but what about <i>obvious explanation</i>?&quot;.<p>Examples:<p><pre><code>  People who live in consistently loud environments often \n  experience chronically elevated levels of stress hormones.\n</code></pre>\nBut did they prove <i>correlation</i> or <i>causation</i>? To me most things that make noise also cause stress. Construction work makes lots of noise and changes your routine. A failing piece of hardware brings me technical headaches along with the noise. The article implies it&#x27;s the noise itself that caused that.<p><pre><code>  “In the absence of sound, the brain often tends to \n  produce internal representations of sound.”\n</code></pre>\nWhen I think of a song, I can <i>hear</i> it in a very similar way to actual songs. Isn&#x27;t this fairly well known? Same thing with the abrupt silence increasing attention. That seems... obvious?<p><pre><code>  There seemed to be a type of background brain activity \n  that was most visible, paradoxically, when the test \n  subject was in a quiet room, doing absolutely nothing.\n</code></pre>\nFirst thing I would do is attribute this to the internal monologue, but I see no mention of that. When I&#x27;m by myself I&#x27;m definitely thinking harder than when listening to music. It&#x27;s hard to actually do nothing, as people who meditate can tell you. Yet it&#x27;s talked like it&#x27;s entirely subconscious activity.<p>I enjoyed reading this piece, and did learn a few things, but it frustrates me to no end when they gloss over stuff like this. Maybe they are not as obvious as I thought, or I missed something that clearly proves them wrong, but my feeling is that the article ignores common sense in a few spots.",1408650996

I listened to the voices, the many voices, vague, distant, but astonishingly human, the Havasu Creek. I heard the doors creak open, the doors creak shut, the old forgotten cabins where no one with tangible substance or the property of reflecting light ever entered, ever returned. I went native and dreamed away days on the shore of the pool under the waterfall, wandered naked as Adam under the cottonwoods, inspecting my cactus gardens. The days became wild, strange, ambiguous --- a sinister element pervaded the flow of time. I lived narcotic hours in which like the Taoist Chuang-tse I worried about butterflies and who was dreaming what. There was a serpent, a red racer, living in the rocks of the spring where I filled my canteens; he was always there, slipping among the stones or pausing to mesmerize me with his suggestive tongue and cloudly haunted primeval eyes. Damn his eyes. We got to know each other rather too well, I think. I agonized over the girls I had known and over those I hoped were yet to come. I slipped by degrees into lunacy, me and the moon, and lost to a certain extent the power to distinguish between what was and what was not myself looking at my hand, I would see a leaf trembling on a branch. A green leaf. I thought of Debussy, of Keats and Blake and Andrew Marvell. I remembered Tom O&#x27;Bedlam. And all of those lost and never remembered. Who would return? To be lost again? I went for walks. I went for walks, and on one of these, the last, I took in Havasu, regained everything that seemed to be ebbing away.</i><p>-- Ed Abbey, Desert Solitaire<p><a href=""http://www.hkhinc.com/arizona/havasu/articles/havasuabbey.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hkhinc.com/arizona/havasu/articles/havasuabbey.ht...</a>",1408650779

Any given language has a domain of problems it&#x27;s suited to: manipulating number, strings, objects with loops and conditionals and organizing code with data (oop).  This is the language domain.  Then users (programmers) create abstractions with the language to represent a problem domain (payment processing, cms, reddit, whatever).<p>The idea with macros is to extend the syntax of the language to move the entire language to the problem domain, for example the html generating dsl pg and company used at viaweb (see his writing).<p>This distinction is not as profound today, imo, because languages have come a long way.  Php didn&#x27;t exist when pg and friends were doing viaweb, today templating html is old hat, but at the time specifying a dsl in lisp macros to dyanmcically generate html was quiet innovative.",1408649618

First, because we don&#x27;t really know to what degree the experimental treatment Brantly and Writebol received is responsible for their recovery. Second, because using the word &quot;cured&quot; implies that there is now a known remedy for the virus.

Brantly&#x27;s DNA might carry some mutation or variant that provides him better natural defense against Ebola, for reasons we don&#x27;t yet know. Perhaps the treatment he received worked in some way, directly or indirectly, in concert with another factor (or several). Perhaps he is just statistically lucky.

8209066,comment,8207676,8207676,2,0,explorigin,,,"A little OT:<p>People here are mostly saying to use webpack.  Webpack is not a replacement for all of gulp but does work well with it (as do the other JS builders).<p>I recently did a tour-of-duty looking for the best JS build system.  I settled on gulp early (over grunt) because grunt files were just too big to do the same thing.  But Gulp is not the best for some aspects of JS building (bundling for multiple-pages).  For those, I looked at RequireJS, Browserify and Webpack.  Here&#x27;s my overview opinion:<p>- RequireJS - a great starter and very powerful.  Since it&#x27;s old and not well-liked in the NodeJS community, people seem to not give it the credit it is due.  Documentation could use some updating (some of the nuances of RequireJS take some googling).  The one feature that this has that others don&#x27;t is that you don&#x27;t need a server to take advantage of it so you can start actually coding now and optimize as your project grows.\n- Browserify - great for building libraries that you expect to run on NodeJS and in the Browser.  But it really falls short on building multiple bundles and dynamically loading resources (it&#x27;s possible, just annoying).  Watchify (auto-building) is nice.\n- Webpack - The cream of the crop.  Multiple pages, dynamic loading, auto-bundling, built-in dev-server to monitor changes.  If you have a project that is more than one-page, use webpack.<p>When using any of these with gulp, I would not use the gulp plugins.  Rather use the NodeJS APIs alone.  It may be a tad more cumbersome, but the gulp plugins mostly just try to shoe-horn gulp&#x27;s streaming into a file-based API (and it&#x27;s limiting).",1408648157

It is analogue to throwing an error with catch statements attached and when you write the try statemet the catch statements attach to the throw statement are made available to said catch. Kent Pitman explains it much more eloquently than me[1].<p>Also to add how well thought out CLOS dynamic redifining of classes is, when one redifines the change is garaunteed to happen between redefinition and the next time you access said class, as to give leeway to the implementation to decide the best strategy to do so (for example if redifining a class with 10K+ instances if you do it all at once the system may become unresponsive). Also if the redefinition isn&#x27;t just adding or removing slots you can provide a function to handle the updating of slots for the redefinition.[2]<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.nhplace.com/kent/Papers/Condition-Handling-2001.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nhplace.com/kent/Papers/Condition-Handling-2001.h...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_upda_1.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_upda...</a>",1408648029

It&#x27;s like wheels in an old clock. If you break one jag of a gear then the whole system stops. You have to take apart all gears, change the affected one, and assemble everything together. Cabal hell breaks loose when you realize that someone changed the shape of a small gear, and you don&#x27;t have access to the old one, except you stored some in your sandbox. Over time you get a whole farm of sandboxes full of obsolete parts. Then after a long time when you have to maintain some of the old code you realize that you have to edit even the foreign (!) libraries yourself because they are totally obsolete and incompatible to the current ones :-) Could that be the reason why there are (AFAIK) so many hackage projects aged or even unmaintained?",1408647848

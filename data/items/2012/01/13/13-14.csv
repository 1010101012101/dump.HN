3460513,comment,3460169,3460372,2,0,babebridou,,,"I've tried to reason my belief. It's hard. The only really earthly reason why I don't like scrolling is that (don't laugh) touch interfaces hurt my fingers. I actually feel pain whenever I touch the iPad or Xoom's screen, or my macbook pro's touchpad. I gave my magicmouse to my sister no more than a couple hours after I had purchased it, because I knew I couldn't sustain the mix of friction & electrical pain for more than a minute at a time.<p>I honestly don't know what came first, the pain or the repulsion for scrolling in general, but the association is fierce.<p>Then I started reasoning on why people would prefer a world without scrolling. The first thing that came to mind is that scrolling does not exist a lot in real life, apart from a few instances: using binoculars, using a magnifier, going forward/backward on some sort of static security camera looking at traffic or something like that. For everything else, we naturally use paging. Paging is strange: using two or three fingers, you can page by any amount you see fit, and every time, the entry you're looking for is on display at the exact same place on your eye. Items can be specified with their page number (324), then a 2D position (fifth line, seventh word). At some point you can even use muscle memory to reach the correct page while you position your eye for receiving the info.<p>Scrolling also has an interesting attribute: it's entirely a computer concept. You have a buffer of information and you increment the offset. But as an end user, using only scrolling, you can't easily perform things such as dichotomy - everyone knows dichotomy even if they don't know the name of it. Go forward a bunch, go backwards half a bunch, go forward half of a half of a bunch, find the entry.<p>Another thing that I don't like with scrolling is how it messes up with the ""5-7 modulo 2"" rule of thumb for decision making (1). It's not that there are more elements than needed, it's that they get pushed up & down when you scroll, so they never appear to be a fixed point in space where you can go in a subset of 3-9 destinations. As a result, you can't select a subset from 3-9 subsets, and you can't select an item from 3-9 items, you actually have to scroll all the way and parse all elements in order to make an informed decision from, say, 15 or 150 possible ones.<p>All these questions (and more (2)) itched me since the day I realized that there <i>could</i> be a computer world without scrolling and maybe we could start dreaming/having nightmares about it... Anyway this is a belief and I'm generally a man of reason - it's tough to put it into words what you know you definitely can't prove :)<p>(1) : <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_...</a><p>(2) : mouse wheel fatigue when browsing websites or expanding trees, why isn't a newsfeed or a time related search result on a logarithmic scale so I can see it all, always, since the start of the century, why did we mix UI and content on webpages when we could simply remove the navigation panes...",1326463055

Now we've lost all of the manual labor in that process and made it easy for anyone who wants to do things the right way to do so  it's still possible to waste your collaborators' time if you really want to but before it was almost a requirement of the process.<p>As a minor point of craft, this also illustrates an area where more training is needed: the problems described are most common when someone makes a fork and keeps every single commit in a single branch.

As you pointed out, new versions of Android allow emulating whatever buttons the device doesn't have on screen. And the newest phones basically don't have any, relying entirely on the screen.<p><i>AFAIK Android was basically unusable on iOS hardware, using the sleep/wake button in an odd way and other things that do not work well.</i><p>This sounds like the port was botched. Nothing you said explains why it couldn't work. In fact the oppposite: you've already illustrated the button layout is irrelevant.",1326460103

The guidelines from an app with hierarchy is to have back and up buttons one all pages but home, up is on top left, back is in nav bar, bottom left, and this even when they point to the same target. Back is about click history, up is about information architecture. It makes sense.",1326460101

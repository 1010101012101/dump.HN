This isn't a project that he decided to do on a whim without evaluating the risks. This is a very well-planned, calculated project that desires to not only be fascinating, but also to make a statement on journalism itself. He won't compromise the integrity of it. Of course, there will be people aiding him along the way out of necessity (translators, guides, etc), but I guarantee you there won't be a helicopter or truck involved.",1358099960

Game engines were probably some of the first to support the OpenGL (even before DX and D3D became relevant).<p><i>I fully expect initiatives like Shield, Ouya, and Steambox to take away huge chunks of the market from Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo.</i><p>Steambox stands a chance if they do exclusives on their platform of things like HalfLife and Portal.<p>Shield doesn't look particularly more inviting than the PSVita. I think the dedicated portable game device is probably dead.<p>Ouya -- breakout success for them would be getting 1% of the market.  Which they may get.

A lot of academics have a favorite classic paper they feel is unjustly underappreciated in their field. Why not put it online?

She didn't care that I was a first time offender, and she could care less about the destruction to my profession and my ability to support my family.  I was lucky enough to have a judge who had the sense to realize what was going on, and a lawyer who, due to the simplicity of the case, didn't bankrupt me.  \nI'll never forget looking into the prosecutors eyes as she treated me like anything but a human being, and tried to needlessly destroy my life.  Had she succeeded in her stated goals, I would have lost my job at a time when I couldn't possibly afford to.  My consequences for my infant son and stay-at-home wife gave her zero pause, but thankfully the judge saw me as a human being, and was intelligent enough to conduct an instant cost/benefit analysis for society in her head.<p>I seriously doubt that any of this is unique to a few prosecutors.

These publications want pageviews, they'll write anything they want to get it.<p>But here's a more logical reason based on my experience traveling to these countries - In every home, they buy a PC once in every ~3-5 years. Now, the iPads have started to become really common, so everyone wants one too. So, you see a rise in the sales of the iPads. The decline is because the PC you bought 5 years ago (For. ex Core 2 Duo) is still as good and supports a lot of applications. So these users don't have this need to upgrade to a newer system - Because they can already multi-task pretty well.<p>One thing you must understand is that PC's are not mobile phones or tablets where they get outdated very fast - like less than a year or so. Whereas, the PC's utility and already excellent overshoots anything else and hence doesn't need an upgrade every year, atleast not for the average consumer. Also, the rise in the sales of the iPads and the decline in the sales of the PC does NOT necessarily mean that the usage of the PC is declining too. What I mean is that, in this era, almost every house has a PC. But tablets are on the rise. But that doesn't mean people are ditching their PC's to buy the tablets, it simply means they just buy the tablets in addition to their existing PC's.

The key is inertia.  While Microsoft may have had a mobile OS before Apple or Google, it never really caught on.  There was no inertia in the smartphone space.  When Apple came along with iOS, almost no one had a smartphone.  Apple didn't have to convince users to switch from a mobile platform they already felt was ok.  Similarly, even when Android entered, the majority of  people didn't have to be convinced to switch.  Most people didn't have a smartphone.<p>Most people do have a desktop.  They've invested years of time learning Windows and have applications specifically written for it.  Desktop Linux has been around for years and hasn't made a dent in Windows.  Why would a new desktop Linux distribution change that?<p>In many ways Android Desktop would be inferior to most desktop Linux distributions because it would be launching with few, if any, apps.  Android has many mobile apps, but just like iOS and OS X, we would really need separate apps for both.  Google could provide a Linux with Android APIs just as Apple shares much of Cocoa between iOS and OS X.  However, traditional linux distributions are quite usable (my complaints about Gnome 3 and Unity aside) and they haven't made much of a dent in Windows.  If people don't want those, why would they want Desktop Android?<p>Branding might help.  People might hear Android and think, ""oh, I've heard of that or used that before"".  Still, the ""Windows"" brand hasn't been helping Microsoft counter Google and Apple in the mobile space.  In fact, looking at the mobile space, we can see how important inertia is.  Despite coming out with a quite good mobile OS and getting Nokia to commit to exclusivity, that combined force just can't make a dent in consumer inertia toward iOS and Android.  Even if Google came out with a premium desktop OS with the Android brand that people know and love, would users change their inertia?<p>It just seems less likely to me.  In mobile, Google and Apple weren't fighting inertia.  They were creating a new space.",1358097869

As to your observation that the sentence was appropriate, keep in mind that James was 15 at the time of his alleged hacking and he was the first minor tried by the US federal government.  Further, the federal prosecutors (Janet Reno, in particular) used James story as a political gain by threatening James with adult charges carrying more than 10 years, all so they could ""prove the Justice Department is willing to get tough on juveniles offenders accused of cyber crime.""

Further, he said he only pursued his exploits because he wanted to explore, which seems to be the very opposite of malicious, after all anyone who was malicious and in control of the Space Stations life sustaining systems could surely have caused more damage than copying the code if they were truly malicious.  Whereas Aaron breached a system and copied information with the intent to redistribute it in mass to the detriment of the system itself, which fits the very definition of malice.  I am in no way justifying anyone's actions and condemning another's actions, simply highlighting that your word choice of malicious really does not seem fitting for James as much as curious, whereas Aaron intended to destroy a system albeit one that many feel unethically controlled the flow of knowledge which should otherwise be open and free.

Having been a hardcore enterprise user of MS Office (excel, ppt, access, to a lesser extent word) for the first 5 years of my career, I'm very familiar with the value these software suites play in large organizations. Shared tools make collaboration easier and shared formats make operations across the globe even possible.<p>Google spreadsheets still a little work to do but excel for Mac is is the same position. So you replace everything MS office can do with a free suite of tools that are a near enough equivalent and what do you get? Just like we saw the personalization of tech in enterprise organizations with hardware (buying and using our own iPhones/iPads and saying screw centralized IT), you will see the same thing happen with software. Add in the collaborative aspects of google drive vs emailing docx files back and forth and you see clear advantages to choosing something other than MS Office.<p>What happens when that next 3com or IBM sprouts up using google docs and becomes a multinational 100k+ employee organization? Do they switch to MS Office? Maybe, but I doubt it would be the best choice for companies in the future.",1358097231

5051178,comment,5050971,5051144,5,0,zanny,,,"The fragmented community doesn't matter. At all, really. It just requires that one group (Canonical, Redhat, whoever) put their guns behind what they provide and try getting that into the market.<p>While having more developers would help the individual efforts, having other people rebuilding the same thing doesn't hurt the individual projects. It hurts the ecosystem to have excessive duplication (and I don't know why I can list 3 dozen window managers or file browsers but can't name one good non-linear video editor) but the success of any single distribution doesn't depend on everyone else getting behind it.<p>I think the comment is actually pretty accurate in relation to the non-geek - the problem has nothing to do with developer fragmentation. Consumers don't care about that. The reason desktop Linux doesn't take off is because Grandma doesn't walk into Best Buy and see an Ubuntu laptop, they see Windows. And every computer 99% of consumers will buy will be from a store, carrying Windows of some flavor.<p>They won't go out of their way looking for a competing OS, or how to install it. As soon as the thing boots into Windows, you have lost them, because they won't change anything. And you can't try teaching them, because Windows has won for them - the device works, hence nothing has to change. Internet Explorer shows emails, even if it is slow, I don't know what ""security vulnerabilities"" are, or why developers hate it (and why do I care? they already rewrite the site to work in 10 year old non-standards compliant web browsers anyway).<p>Linux will get widespread adoption the day it is the default. Because it honestly does work, when you take the time to tailor the hardware to it. System76 or a Dell Ubuntu laptop are as far as you need to go to see that in effect - they work out of the box because the engineers tailored the device to the OS. Like they <i>all</i> do with Windows already.<p>The problem with Ubuntu, though, is that it is too different. It doesn't look like Windows 7 (or, for a lot of people, XP still). Instantly, nobody likes it. They want the same thing, better. Not something different. They don't want change, or to have to learn or read. They want to read their kids facebook posts.

5051165,comment,5050811,5050811,16,0,IgorPartola,,,"Honest question: why don't researchers normally do this? Those in the software development do this all the time: set up a tumblr/Wordpress/whatever blog and publish our findings. If I had a dime for every time I saw an article about some benchmark of tech X vs Y...<p>If every research lab ran a blog-type setup where they published their findings (along with any other updates), the whole field could be revolutionized. The general public would have much more direct access to what the researchers are working on. We could even add the ability to donate to the researchers directly. This would hopefully foster collaboration as well. Instead of waiting for someone to come out with a paper to find out what they've been up to (unless you have a very close relationship with the particular researcher), you can just read their tweet/blog post/etc a la ""tried sample X, results negative, but this is weird...""<p>Combined with a research semantic markup (think OpenGraph but for scientific concepts), this could be linked into searchable databases. Peer review could be built in, maybe even via public key crypto: ""this article is signed by 17 trusted researchers"".<p>This saves everyone money: no more having to subscribe to expensive research publications. You could have for-hire scientific editors built in as a service too. Every time you publish a paper you run it by an editor, but the editor now works for you; or you don't, and you just publish the paper and let the world decide if it is any good.<p>The platform itself would probably have to be fairly extensive. We would want it to be distributed so that anyone can run their own system if they choose. We'd also want to have some more centralized hubs of this type, analogous to GitHub/Bitbucket. These might include easy access to for-hire editors, Tex/LaTex support, etc. There should also be a default license for the content. Perhaps an extension of Creative Commons but with specific provisions for the peculiarities of this field.<p>My premise here is that while there is a whole lot of institutions that attempt to enable collaboration, they do often just get in the way. However, from what I've seen of researchers, they have the same mentality as the software developers: they want to share their findings with the largest possible audience and don't really care about much else. I think if it was easy to do this type of setup many would go along with it. What do others think?<p>Edit: a nice side-effect of this could be that you don't have to be associated with an academic institution to publish. Currently, I could learn, say, all there is to know about quantum physics by reading all sorts of publications and material that is more or less freely available. I could then theoretically come up with something brand new, but couldn't get my voice heard since I am not a research professor at an institution. However, with this system graduates of the likes of the Khan Academy could have the same access to publishing and peer review.",1358096815

5051162,comment,5050971,5051079,3,0,zanny,,,"> The number of applications, the vibrant developer community and the number of epic GAMES!<p>All of these either have changed in recent years, or are in the process of changing. Steambox will potentially see the downfall of the Windows gaming platform - if developers switch gears to opengl en masse, in half a decade we will easily be able to emulate the 15 years of Windows monopoly under Wine, possibly even integrated with Steam by that point.<p>I don't think Microsoft has any developer cred anymore. Android and iOS are too big, the Windows Store is too hostile, and Visual Studio isn't the only option in town anymore. Mono is pretty mature, so all those C# apps (C# is a brilliant language, btw, one great thing coming out of MS there) can be ported. The Unity game engine is a pretty big deal nowadays, being cross platform and supporting multiple script languages including C#.<p>The fact that the Microsoft ecosystem and community was hostile to open source and code sharing basically meant that FOSS (and even OSX) could build up a backlog of shared base to constantly take advantage of, while Visual Studio and that entire ecosystem was always shackled to what Microsoft provided.<p>The reason Windows is everywhere is two fold - one, it is the default. Two, it is expected. If you got <i>any</i> other computer OS into Best Buy, it would still flounder next to #2, because Microsoft has created this culture of computers = Windows. I see college kids and teens with OSX laptops, not their parents. They still run Windows. Because they are used to it.<p>In a way though, because they are used to it, Microsoft is in many ways already toast. Because Windows 8 is too much a departure for that kind of person to upgrade to and adapt to. What is going to happen is that unless Windows 9 brings back the classic desktop as the default, most people will be sitting on 7 like we did XP for 6 - 8 years.<p>Strangely, the only even remotely comparable experience to Windows 7 out there that I can find is KDE. It doesn't come that way default, which is a great hampering, but the default KDE suite can be tweaked to behave like Windows 7 to some great detail. I don't imagine a FOSS software project getting into Best Buy corporate and seeing laptops with Kubuntu served to consumers, though.",1358096754

Also, approving apps does cull out a range of malware, because it is human- and computer-analyzed before entry. As I said previously, this has its downsides, but it does make it harder to get malware into the iOS App Store. Not impossible, but harder.",1443758387

Get away from the airport and downtown, unless it&#x27;s for work, drinks, and a ball game.\n2. Find one of the park + restaurant pockets and relax, walk to great coffee (Blacksmith), and Uber home.\n3. Rent a B-cycle to connect between the culturally rich areas. Within the loop, they&#x27;re only 1-2 miles apart.\n4. Visit museums. Each one seems to be nestled by a park, nice homes, and good food.<p>Like most cities I&#x27;ve visited, when I go alone, I get a tilted opinion of it. But, with someone who knows the area, you&#x27;ll be the best it has to offer.<p>Lastly, despite being an oil and gas town, there&#x27;s a huge medical community and a bustling Node/JavaScript/Ruby community.<p>The open-source crowd is extremely supportive and we consistently help find work for new comers and Iron Yard graduates.",1443758320

We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and the Philippines. I am posting this from a cafe in Siem Reap right nowwww.<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=""http://we.are.expensify.com/apply"" rel=""nofollow"">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>).

All commercial and enterprise routers (like the ones in your colo) use an ASIC for transit traffic. Management traffic usually gets routed by the ASIC to a GP processor like an x86 or similar.<p>> <i>On a 10 Gbps link it is possible to pass packets at a rate of 14.88 Mpps.  At that rate that we have just 67.2ns per packet.  Also you have to keep in mind that an L3 cache hit, yes that is a “hit” and not a miss, costs us something on the order of 12 nanoseconds.</i><p>It&#x27;s for this reason that transit traffic is handled by the ASIC, where rules for the session have already been established, and it can just match and forward/drop/reject. The management packets (of which there are far fewer, but they require a great deal more processing) are handed off to the general purpose (GP) processor.

But I think it was always pretty obvious that the two products had completely different philosophies -- and also that they still did compete to a good extent, because after all they are both issue trackers for software development (at least primarily; I guess JIRA also aspires to track issues building your airplane and whatnot).<p>If those were the only two bug trackers that existed, I myself would choose JIRA if I had somebody else to set up and run it, and Fobugz if I had to do it myself.",1443757379

In fact, both came much later than these trends started.<p>Broadly speaking, tabletop games are divided into what are called Euro games and Ameritrash [1]. Euro games have less player-conflict and (often but not always) less luck.<p>Euro games either originated in or were popularized in Germany and the beginning of that trend is really Settlers of Catan and (later) Carcasonne. Both of these games were and are big but for the more &quot;serious&quot; Euro games, the trend really took off with Puerto Rico, which came out in 2002. Since Puerto Rico there has been an absolute explosion of games.<p>In the 90s we might&#x27;ve had 10-20 games to choose from? Now, hundreds.<p>Every few years there tended to be a standout game which would propel the industry in some way, often evidenced by the many knockoffs. Agricola (2007), Race for the Galaxy (2007; although it was largely a rethemed San Juan (2004), which itself was inspired by Puerto Rico) which led to Dominion (2008+), Terra Mystica (2013), etc.<p>Kickstarter is really feeding off this success not the other way around.<p>As for DRM (including copy protection), this has been a thing most of the life of computer gaming. Now is really no different other than DRM of the last 10+ years has moved towards always-on Internet connections or, worse, turning single player games into games that can only save online (eg the SimCity V fiasco).<p>My experience with LAN gaming was it was one of two types of games: FPSs and RTSs.<p>FPSs honestly haven&#x27;t changed all that much in years. Sure the graphics have gotten better and there have been minor improvements but honestly an FPS is an FPS.<p>We played LAN Warcraft 3 (eg tower defense maps). Personally I prefer turn-based strategy games, which are a dying breed (sadly).<p>But what drove those early LAN gaming sessions was I think two things:<p>1. Novelty; and<p>2. Internet connections.<p>There was a time when multiplayer gaming wasn&#x27;t possible with the Internet connections of the day. Now it is. The result is less need to drag your computers to someone elses house.<p>Of course the effect of that is that you can then play with anyone not just your friends, which ironically seems to mean that you just don&#x27;t do it anymore. Anyone older the school age seems to hate online gaming with strangers as you have to deal with cheaters and kids who have nothing better to do than play 8+ hours a day, which is fine, but it&#x27;s not fun for the casual gamer.<p>See why tabletop games work is that tabletop gaming is a social exercise. You get together with friends and play. If you just played online, even with your friends, I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;d have anywhere near as much stickiness and definitely less adherents.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Ameritrash"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Ameritrash</a>",1443756315

It is also a known fact that the existing (public or private) systems are unable to deal with the issue sufficiently on broad level.\nOnly interventions based on communal support and modern technology can be the answer. We in Heimo are on a bold mission to build world’s biggest peer support community.<p>Heimo is social media for peer support, where people can help each other, share stories and connect. It is basically a communication tool designed for holding group discussions online in the context of mental well-being. The fundamental idea in Heimo is that there are sensitive issues, such as mental health problems, that many of us comes across in our lives, but there is a certain stigma in it that prevents us to seek help and to talk about those issues. Heimo makes it easier for all of us. www.heimo.co",1443755281

My Mac will run anything I want, my Surface will do the same, and my Android tablet has both side-loading and an unlocked bootloader. Hell, even my router is unlocked, and it&#x27;s from ASUS, not some small open-source oriented manufacturer.<p>You claim that if we even allow companies to put out products with locked firmware, it will lead to a dystopian future. So when is this slippery slope going to start? The iPhone was released in 2007, and pretty much nothing has become more restrictive since then (especially considering that pretty much all phones were already locked down). The threat of any computers being TPM locked by the manufacturer, let alone <i>all</i> of them died in its cradle. If anything, we&#x27;re moving in the opposite direction, since Apple now allows sideloading on iOS devices[1].<p>And what about users who want a phone that is locked down for security purposes? Why shouldn&#x27;t we be able to choose the phones we want, while those who want sideloading/flashing choose the many options that support that? If either laws or market collusion actually removes this as an option, I&#x27;ll join the fight. But for right now, it looks like this war on general purpose computing isn&#x27;t even brewing.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://9to5mac.com/2015/06/10/xcode-7-allows-anyone-to-download-build-and-sideload-ios-apps-for-free/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://9to5mac.com/2015/06/10/xcode-7-allows-anyone-to-downl...</a>",1443755155

With software like Photoshop, not every change is obvious or easily visible. Maybe the other guy tweaked blending parameters of a layer, or reconfigured some effects layers.

138123,comment,137924,137932,0,0,swombat,,,"""don't really make anything new possible"" - hardly.<p>Flex allows easy integration of UI concepts like drag-n-drop, neat animations with low cpu usage, integration of streaming media, lowered response times thanks to model caching on the client... and the ease of development should NOT be discounted... Users tend to like an application that exists more than one that doesn't. Ease and speed of development are a huge bonus.<p>As for the ""invonvenience"" aspect, interestingly, I've found that the only people who resent Flash in some way are <i>all</i> geeks. The rest of the world is blithely ignorant as to the difference until you explain it to them, and even then they don't care. So, if your primary market is over-opinionated and out-of-date geeks (rather than the more forward thinking ones who are actively writing or learning Flex by now), then definitely don't use Flex.<p>If, on the other hand, you plan to target the rest of the world, Flex seems like a good bet!<p>PS: don't use Flex for writing your blog or news site! RIAs are for applications (gmail, gdocs, rescuetime, basecamp), not pure content sites (blogs, slashdot, reddit, NYTimes..).",1205667867

I guess that means I'm in categories #1 and #2.  Perhaps a little bit of #5, ""waiting for that killer idea.""  If my idea was killer enough, maybe I would be less afraid of looking for investors.<p>I don't want to turn this into a political discussion (it's one of the reasons I don't go to reddit anymore), but it does make you wonder how many more businesses could get off the ground if we had government-provided healthcare, and people didn't feel stuck at their day-jobs for the health insurance.  :/",1205665520

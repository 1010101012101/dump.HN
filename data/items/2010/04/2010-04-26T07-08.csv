I've been trying for ~2 months, and so far here is what I am doing:<p>First I have set up an intense learning regime for myself, my first 'semester' is on the basics in a lot of different subjects. (math, physics, nutrition, fitness, programming theory, gardening, writing, photography, chemistry, taoism, buddhism, carpentry and a few others)<p>Second I have worked up a basic triage system for dealing with all of the information that I have flowing to me: 1st off is it of interest or not, is yes then why? For entertainment or for knowledge? If it is for entertainment then I will read it if I have accomplished my learning goals for the day, if not, oh well, into the trash. If its for knowledge then does it apply to one of my learning topics? If not, then bookmarked for a rainy day or another semester.<p>For the stuff that applies to one of my current learning topics I apply the methodology from ""How to read a book"" (recommended to me by someone here, and I strongly recommend it to anyone who wants to read to go from ""understanding less to understanding more"") and scan it to see if and where it has a place in my learning network/schedule, then put it into my learning tracking database for integration into this or a later semester depending on how it fits.<p>Its been an interesting couple of months, and I will start blogging about how this process is coming along. After a bit of a wobbly start, and a hard time finding good resources on how to make self-guided learning more efficient I am starting to see good progress in my learning, feel more comfortable with my online consumption and am really starting to make some progress on my start-up ideas and just my life in general.",1272265564

I don't find it suspicious that he's not dropping specific ISBNs in an <i>interview</i>, and substituting ""Bob"" for ""North Korea"" doesn't illuminate any opportunity for skepticism that I can see.",1272265484

At that level, it's very much a personal relationship rather than a company-employee relationship where loyalty only goes one way. Not all companies are about the creation of profit at any cost... some actually like creating an environment that is pleasant to work in, with free food, etc. for no reason other than making life a bit more enjoyable.",1272265428

When Albania was first liberalized after Hoxha, half the population got frauded and the economy folded. The population threw over the government and it became a failed state.<p>Similar events unfolded in Russia and many other former Soviet states, after their economies opened up - although with less devastating consequences.<p>In Haiti, it's estimated that 60% of the GDP was swindled from the people in one of the poorest societies on earth.<p>In the Philippines, there have been a number of Ponzi schemes during the 00s.<p>There is nothing charming or clever about it, at all.",1272265200

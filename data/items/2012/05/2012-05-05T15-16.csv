I.e., liberals often consider ""the citizens of the US were able to elect representatives who X"" to be an invalid justification for policy X.<p>The question is, what principle are liberals using to come up with views like this? Another question in the same line of thinking is: is there a principle beyond ""I like/dislike this policy"" which the courts can use to invalidate laws? (Note that appealing to court precedents and reinterpretations of the constitution doesn't really answer this, since the court can always re-reinterpret or make a new precedent.)<p>[1] I hate phrasing it this way, since the feelings it generates (""I {love/hate} liberals SOOOO MUCH"") reduce everyone's IQ by about 15 pts.",1336233433

Enclose the /element/ in matching delimiters, not the tag. These simple things makes people think differently about how they use the language. Contrary to the foolish notion that syntax is immaterial, people optimize the way they express themselves, and so express themselves differently with different syntaxes. Next, introduce macros that look exactly like elements, but that are expanded in place between the reader and the ""object model"". Then, remove the obnoxious character entities and escape special characters with a single character, like \, and name other entities with letters following the same character. If you need a rich set of publishing symbols, discover Unicode. Finally, introduce a language for micro-parsers than can take more convenient syntaxes for commonly used elements with complex structure and make them /return/ element structures more suitable for processing on the receiving end, and which would also make validation something useful. The overly simple regular expression look-alike was a good idea when processing was expensive and made all decisions at the start-tag, but with a DOM and less stream-like processing, a much better language should be specified that could also do serious computation before validating a document -- so that once again processing could become cheaper because of the ""markup"", not more expensive because of it. But the one thing I would change the most from a markup language  suitable for marking up the incidental instruction to a type-setter  to the data representation language suitable for the ""market"" that  XML wants, is to go for a binary representation.",1336233197

The attempt to enumerate the ""kinds"" of normal forms is, IMHO, a mistake.  The only point to doing it is reducing bug surface (and just maybe storage space efficiency), so really: who cares whether or not your data is second or third normal form?  Does the duplication of fields help or hurt your application?<p>A good example of this is US ZIP codes.  In theory (I think), a ZIP uniquely identifies a city and state.  But in practice no one stores it this way because the maintenance of that data (by all parties: some people don't know zips, or type them incorrectly) is more expensive than the savings from normalization.",1336233159

It reads, ""It is the sense of Congress that providers of electronic communications services and manufacturers of electronic communications service equipment shall ensure that communications systems permit the government to obtain the plain text contents of voice, data, and other communications when appropriately authorized by law.""

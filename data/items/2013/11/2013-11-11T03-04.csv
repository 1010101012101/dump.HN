Making games requires you to learn about data structures, algorithms, optimization, and providing a good user experience all while making something that&#x27;s enjoyable for yourself. Even if you don&#x27;t ever plan on making games in the future, the process makes you seek out new knowledge and better methods of implementing everything, plus it also gives you the chance to work with a bunch of different areas of design (UI, controls, AI, possibly networking, graphics/shaders, and loads else), so you might find one subject you like more than the others and discover your specialty.<p>As for motivation, that&#x27;s unfortunately something that you have to find for yourself. Once you start working on a satisfying project, you won&#x27;t want to stop. The hard part is finding something that&#x27;s satisfying.",1384142372

Of course at the time, I thought it was terrible; it turned out to be incredibly liberating and probably one the best things that&#x27;s happened to me, professionally.<p>I was a software consultant for about a year and it was all networking - after all, that&#x27;s how business gets done in the real world. I never had a time where I had too little work to do. My &#x27;hack&#x27; for the whole thing was working in a coworking space, which is IMO the best ~$300/mo you can ever spend in a city that has one. I was lucky enough to have been working in one for more than a year and half before I started working for contract work, but I think you could easily do it in less time than that. When I started looking for work, everyone knew somebody; I never went outside of my space to find any work. It was incredibly convenient and really just worked out easily.<p>I always advise coders who are looking for freedom, a work environment change, or are newly unemployed to try a coworking space while they figure things out. You&#x27;ll make a bunch of friends in a low-stress environment, meet entrepreneurs, and make great connections in the community that will get you work. It has worked well for those I know who have tried it - the secret is finding the right space. A socially-oriented space with as few walls as possible is best. You get used to the noise. Take long coffee breaks, go to lunch with people, go to happy hours and meetups. If you let it be known that you&#x27;re looking for work and others know your skills, the jobs will come to you.",1384142048

6709852,comment,6708308,6708308,1,0,logn,,,"If you&#x27;re weighing freelancing vs employment, I&#x27;d recommend doing medium term contracts instead. Look for the typical 3-12 month contracts and go from there. You&#x27;ll get decent experience, have some stability, and it won&#x27;t be terrifying financially. Keep focused on building up connections to clients, stay active in your local community (meetups, conferences, user groups, etc), market your services, and establish a business presence (LLC, business bank acct, office space, phones, website). But at the same time, your bread-and-butter financially can be your contracts, until you&#x27;re able and comfortable moving to pure freelancing. You can also try to structure your contracts so that you&#x27;re paid on a 1099 instead of a W-2 and that way you can start filing as self-employed and get the full deduction for health insurance and the assortment of other tax breaks (but get your own tax advice; this isn&#x27;t it). Note that you should expect more money being paid on a 1099 since you pay self employment taxes (I usually discount W-2 work at 15%). But if clients want to control your work day, they&#x27;ll be reluctant to pay you on a 1099 because of IRS rules.<p>If you just jump right into freelancing, I&#x27;d worry you&#x27;ll never get the opportunity to really see first-hand and in-depth how businesses are run and that you&#x27;ll always lack something in terms of project, team, and management skills.",1384141877

Something along those lines will probably be essential as we move forward.  Maybe not to 4 Volts.  That&#x27;s probably not necessary.  Somewhere in the range of 20 to 50 V there&#x27;s a good safe spot.  I am not up to speed on where safety levels lie for different circumstances.  I&#x27;s more about current through your body than absolute voltages.  Of course, a higher voltage makes producing high currents that much easier.<p>High voltage and current circuits are not the easiest to interrupt mechanically.

Building to an executable that only depends on libc -- yes please! love that about Go.<p>I am scared about safety and fault tolerance. Ability to share memory is good for performance but a shared heap in a large concurrent application is scary to me.  Not sure what I think about multiple channels and running select over them.  Then it pseudo-randomly choosing one channel among those that can receive.  Erlang&#x27;s focus on processes/actors vs channel and each actor having a single mailbox somehow makes more sense to me. Having a shared heap mean faster data processing but GC cannot be fully concurrent.<p>Now passing channels inside other channels is cool, but also kind of scary to me. You can pass channels, inside channels, inside channels, can make some kind of a lazy computation chain.<p>Also I have been wondering, but couldn&#x27;t find it by doing a quick search, is it possible to build supervision trees out of goroutines like one builds supervision trees in Erlang&#x27;s OTP. Say I want to have a chat client goroutine to keep the chat up. But I want to monitor it in case it crashes (panics?) then then spawn another one perhaps. Is that possible?",1384141429

Sometimes one of those meanings is sharply negative. Usage can be ambiguous. The use of such a negatively-charged word (see: n-word, f-word, r-word) carries a risk that listeners will infer an unintended meaning. That risk is often inconvenient for a well-intentioned speaker, and simultaneously convenient to some privileged or partisan group.<p>And words obviously have the power to frame issues. An inheritance tax is a sensible measure that increases government revenues at the point where money has its lowest marginal value to its owner, while also serving as a check on dynastic wealth.

Your milage might vary, but for me, I won&#x27;t ever work in a centralize office environment or ask others to if I can avoid it. When I travel to meet with customers, honestly I&#x27;m repulsed by the <i>lack</i> of productivity I see in the face time that is suppose to be a bolster. For example, when you aren&#x27;t face-to-face for hours at a time, it forces you to be more diligent at good communication and choosing the right channel for communication. When you know you can just lean over the cube wall or invite people to a conference room, you are more likely to kill an hour of their day wasting time.",1384139235

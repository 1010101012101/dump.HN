On the other hand, we have no interplanetary <i>exploitation</i> worth talking about, and there are no colonies on Venus which would have rebelled. Nor one on Antarctica. So Heinlein was either too pessimistic or (much more likely) too optimistic.<p>&quot;Antipodes rocket service&quot; is not close. &quot;Antipodes service&quot; means non-stop service to the other side of the world. Concorde didn&#x27;t use rockets and required several refuellings to get that far.<p>&quot;Rise of religious fanaticism&quot; Is there any time since that prediction was made that it wasn&#x27;t true? The Christian right (in Heinlein&#x27;s construction, they would be religious fanatics though not as severe as Nehemiah Scudder) has been influential in US politics since the 1970s, and managed to take over most state GOP membership by 2000.<p>&quot;Commercial steroptics&quot; too is a tricky one. There have been a number of 3D movies (red-green and polarized), including red-green 3D shows broadcast on TV. In the 1990s the place I worked at had 3D shutter glasses in order to visualize protein structures, and I saw an autostereoscopic laptop about 10 years ago. These were all from companies, so qualify as &quot;commercial&quot;.<p>Why does then does &quot;3D TV, Oculus Rift&quot; count as particularly notable, other than being what there is now?  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_television"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_television</a> says &quot;As of late 2013 the number of 3D TV viewers started to decline in popularity&quot; and points out that &quot;In July 2013 the BBC announced that it would be indefinitely suspending 3D programming due to a lack of uptake&quot; and &quot;In 2013, in the US, ESPN 3D was shut down due to lack of demand, followed by Xfinity 3D and all DirecTV 3D programming in 2014.&quot;<p>For that matter, &quot;Also in May 1997, ABC had a special line-up of shows that showcased specific scenes in 3D. The shows included Home Improvement, Spin City, The Drew Carey Show, Ellen, Family Matters, Step by Step, Sabrina, The Teenage Witch, and America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos.&quot;<p>These suggest that there have been several phases where people believe there is a commercial market for &#x27;steroptics&#x27;, push it on the hopes of developing such a market, and then finding that it&#x27;s a lot smaller than they had hoped. It may be that Oculus Rift is the first to crack the problem, that hasn&#x27;t been established, and there are other head mounted displays stretching out decades before it, including the VR crazy of the 1990s.",1414487761

I find it <i>very easy</i> to see how people who are here illegally or who are here legally but not entitled to vote might end up being registered to vote by accident - I nearly (and criminally) registered to vote years ago while I was signing some innocuous-seeming petition to save whales or something like that in the middle of the street. At the time I hadn&#x27;t been in the US very long, maybe a year? It was only because I&#x27;m the sort of pedant who reads the fine print on everything, even TV adverts, that I noticed the boilerplate text at the bottom of the form about how I would be breaking the law if registered to vote without being entitled. A lot of people just follow the instructions of the signature-gatherer, and those persons are a) paid by the number of people they sign up and b) not necessarily so well-informed that they realize the significance of the legal problems that illegal registration can cause for the registrant.<p><i>It&#x27;s a bit disheartening we have papers that need to be in order</i><p>Agreed, and I don&#x27;t think you should have to carry ID if you&#x27;re not voting/driving/engaged in something which can materially impact others.

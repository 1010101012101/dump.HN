USB didn't, so USB devices were cheaper and they won the war once USB 2 came out and the speed difference was negligible.<p>So not all Apple decisions work, like PC's over Macs.  Apple lost that war as the open standard won.<p>And then sometimes it is the better design, like iPods and iPhones over their competition that wins.<p>My point is I'm not sure your argument holds in general, sometimes its this, sometimes its the other thing that works.",1284801807

In a good design scenario, much of the site should still keep operating even if the backend databases are timing out from load. For example, your cache layer (if not expired) should continue serving cached content/logins/etc. This may not be as useful for clients that sign in randomly or throughout the day, but for people who use the site frequently or stay logged in throughout the day their sessions should stay active in this scenario.<p>The content in the user profile which doesn't require ACID compliance could also be using caching and nosql/mysql/etc which would keep the apps working even longer in the event of an outage of a particular piece of technology. Because this technology doesn't require some of the more complicated requirements of Oracle RAC it may also be easier to recover/restore old data, again assuming this doesn't have a particular need for ACID.",1284800684

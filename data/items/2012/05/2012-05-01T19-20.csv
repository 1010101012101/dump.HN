We use github, and yes I know not everyone uses git, but the integration there is just painful.  Just to get anything working is a chore.  Fisheye has become worse and worse over the years and it's easy to see why - because the company just doesn't care about taking the time to make anything work really really well.",1335902379

3916094,comment,3915267,3915267,7,0,languagehacker,,,"Okay, Atlassian, we get it. You think that GitHub is your biggest competitor. You're worried about the idea of source control being the focal point of developer productivity, because it makes issue tracking a secondary feature, and not a primary ure. And this threatens your biggest product, Jira, which is already kind of a mess to configure for source control. It's the reason why you want to own BitBucket and directly compete with Git, and it's the reason why you're adding this to your ecosystem -- so that you can own these aspects customers' projects. Customers who need source control hosting first would start with BitBucket, and customers who need it after they've project-managed and roadmapped everything in advance would realize late in the game that they need something like Stash.<p>It seems like trying to capture every kind of use case with a smattering of different products will ultimately be Atlassian's undoing. Yeah, you capture more of the market in total by taking this approach, but it also means that you have to maintain additional products, many of which are at odds with each other. There are so many technology businesses failed that tried to be ""everything to everybody"" that it's not even worth getting into here.

Go for it!<p>If you want to get rich and jump in, awesome!

So I think one should refrain from making bold claims like ""users are generally concerned about UX over security"" (I believe you meant privacy and not security).<p>I totally agree with the philosophy behind your claim that users see privacy as part of a utility function where sometimes the value of the experience trumps privacy controls and it also depends on the value one attaches to the information he/she is sharing. So from that perspective, especially given the publicly accepted norm that everything on instagram is public (like in Twitter), this ""privacy calculus"" will probably work out in favor of Instagram's decision here. And yes, it is not a horrible thing for them to be doing either.<p>But it does break the trust for those who are accustomed to the connotations of certain UI features (like ""Done"" button and progress bar).<p>Instagram will get away with this, but if somebody with a less trust level was engaging in such pre-""Done"" uploading activity, there would be pushback. What I fear is that the co-founder by sharing this with the developers community will encourage this behavior in other startups/apps and this will then become an industry best practice even for the shady apps (just like it did for the address book).",1335900755

I disagree that it presents no new compelling idea. What is not new to you and me maybe new to someone else.

There are merits to the post whether or not you agree with them or whether you think there are any to begin with.<p>3. While I totally agree that at the end of the day, the decision to do something resides with the decision maker, I also acknowledge that what the author points out as ""me too"" syndrome do exist to an extent and in many ways that can in fact be harmful as well.<p>4. I do agree its never good to be condescending but I don't believe that was the intention here. You asked where would we on our own startup journey if our friends were not so supportive. While I do agree as a whole, I also believe that a great friend doesn't always blindly support their friend. Sometimes being a friend simply means having the courage to point out where your concerns are and why you are concerned. In the end, the support is to allow your friend to take that information and go about making the choices he or she needs to make. While the author didn't dive into this (what he did or didn't discuss with his friend beyond what was posted), I have a hard time believing they made this post with a condescending tone over trying to help others (the readers) see what may be obvious to you and me but may not be to many.",1335900495

They can't achieve (a) and (b) with full-time hires; they'd either face uncertain expenses in ramping up people (and possibly hiring bad people), or they'd be locked in to paying for a particular basket of skills full-time for a year.<p>If you are providing determinism and flexibility, real clients don't care whether the number of hours you bill is 1 or 8. For most projects and most values of ""hours"" below, say, 40, the end result is cost effective compared to full-time hires. The client is happy to have a slot into which they can push dollars and have a predictable amount of working software come out the other end.<p>So, back to ""generous"": when you set yourself up for sub-1-day billing, you're doing a bunch of stuff that <i>doesn't</i> generate value for the customer. You're giving them ""loose change"" invoice amounts that don't impact their budgets. You're forcing them to <i>think</i> about the amount of loose change you're giving them. You're setting yourself and your client up for potential disputes --- any dispute is going to cost the client something commensurate with a billable day anyways. And you're burning yourself out by working harder for less money, which the client doesn't want; they want to know that 2 years from now, the same slot will still be there, accepting dollars and spitting out working software.<p>This discussion obviously stumbles across some nerdthink neural tripwire. ""I worked for an hour, I should bill an hour!"" That's perfectly understandable nerd reasoning. If it helps to translate nerdthink into business language, think about the minimum 1-day billing increment as a way of expressing your bill rate properly; you're not ""billing for time you didn't work"", you're just doing a variable bill rate in which a 1-hour project costs 8 times as much as an 8-hour project.

I see this in everyday life all the time, and I daresay the root of it is an irrational subconscious fear that the person being criticized (here, the friend) may succeed, and what that potential success implies about the speaker.<p>In this case, if the friend follows their ""me too"" path and ""succeeds"", the author's <i>beliefs</i> about the ""right"" path would be shown to be unfounded.  Of course at this point the author has invested, as stated in the post, <i>five years</i> of time and energy on this path and is unsurprisingly going to be reluctant to admit there may have been another path that could have taken him to the same destination with a lower time and energy investment.  Instead, the author intellectualizes and rationalizes his choices to prevent acknowledging the uncomfortable truth.<p>There's a mentally healthier way of dealing with this:  acknowledge there are multiple paths, and acknowledge that destinations are multi-variate.  For example, what does the friend want as a destination, just money?  Maybe the author wants something more - experience, satisfaction of starting their own business, etc.  It's dysfunctional to suggest the friend should choose the same destination as the author;  once this is accepted, you can happily get on with your choice of path and not worry that others have made different choices.  Occasionally, of course, you will find somebody has arrived at the same destination you desire with less time and energy -- at that point, set aside your ego and learn from them!",1335900082

When the Nest came out, we had a sour look on our face and when SparkFun disassembled it we saw where we matched. Honestly, I saw the idea as maintaining the source of income. By following the App Store approach, you sell the barebones platform in which the user can pick and choose what 'apps' he/she wants to use.<p>To be fair, HVAC control is HARD. You are dealing with ASHRAE Thermal Comfort Levels (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_comfort"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_comfort</a>) that can change from humidity, solar, CO2 levels, the list goes on. Likewise, at least from our perspective, you inherit a lot of the pre-existing issues at a location. Suddenly, if a fan belt snaps and the site gets uncomfortable, you (be it a company or a DIY-er) have to justify it wasn't your fault before moving to actually fixing the issue.<p>Another problem is getting that sour taste out of the customers' mouth. Even if it isn't your fault, you are on the frontline and they aren't going to be happy with you saying 'Its not my fault.'<p>Edit: As for ensuring lights are off, the Digi SmartPlug maintains its status when it kills the power. Whatever is plugged into it will be 'off' when you set it to off state, and 'on' when you energize it. I played with their demo set at their conference last year and I hate to say, but it was fun clicking a button on a webpage and seeing a light over some sales rep's head turn off.",1335899118

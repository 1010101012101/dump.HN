However, part of the thinking behind persona is that most sites will want to let you reset your password, so they store: salt+password:username:email. Some are being &quot;clever&quot; and use the email as the username -- hopefully paired with a numeric/uuid uid -- so that when you change email providers, you can retain your account. Some might store a phone number for recovery etc. Some require a working email in order to register (to fight spam accounts).<p>Further, in general most sites will log your ip, be able to match that to your username, and so, unless you&#x27;re using tor, be able to provide enough information to track you across sites anyway.",1392522928

I wouldn&#x27;t recommend running &#x27;barefoot&#x27; full-time to start with, either with something like Vibrams or literally shoeless, but this is actually what fixed my shin splint problems. Most people who haven&#x27;t trained in running are terrible heel-planters - striking the ground first with the heel, then rolling through. That jars your shins and legs (and upper body etc, it&#x27;s all connected) something fierce. Running barefoot pretty much <i>forces</i> you to knock that shit off, and the results are quite dramatic.<p>So maybe don&#x27;t go straight for barefoot, but either do a few <i>short</i> runs on grass shoeless, and pay attention to the way you&#x27;re running.

7246557,comment,7244109,7245724,1,0,singingfish,,,"OP is incorrect that psychology is not a science.  The remainder of the discussion is quite tedious, and shows that the OP has a very confused notion of mind body separation (hint, by and large they are not, whether you&#x27;re a dualist an epihenominist or something else - I tend to something else but wouldn&#x27;t feel confident to write my viewpoint down).<p>What is correct is that experimental designs are more or less not possible in behavioural psychology.  This could be OP&#x27;s second point of confusion.  Essentially the only time real experiemnts as opposed to quasi-experiments are possible in science is where a known physical quantity is already well understood (e.g. moles of Hydrogen, quanta of photons, metres of distance, joules of energy etc).  Where complete control over a known physical quantity is not practical, the only possible experimental design is in fact a quasi experimental design.  However, to claim that quasi experiments are not valid is to deny a large amount of scientific knowledge, and flies in the face of deductive logic.<p>Next up we have this whole notion of falsifiability.  It&#x27;s a red herring.  The discipline of psychology was the original field that enabled the types of statistical analysis that underpin much of the modern economy.  Psychology provided the intellecutal basis of using single case studies (e.g patients with a rare or unique illness) to further scientific understanding.  In psychology this resulted in much of our understanding of the functions of different parts of the brain prior to the development of neuroimaging.<p>Finally, lots of concepts in computer science originate in psychology - heuristic being the one that comes to mind at the moment.  My entire development methodology is based on the idea that human short term memory is fixed to 7±2 items (based on data from quasi-experimental studies).  Thus when I am writing code my primary purpose is to only have to attend to 5 things at a time, at most, as this is the lower bound of the reliability of my short term memory.",1392522145

Nevertheless, the narratives are strikingly similar: boundary-pushing, widely-respected hackers confront aggressive and ambitious prosecutors, where the right kind of support from the school can make all the difference in the world.<p>Is MIT being hypocritical here, or did they learn something from the Aaron Swartz tragedy?

When Sartre said his famous &quot;the hell is other people&quot; he probably meant this too. Others, like Mishima, Rand, Nabokov, Hesse also emphasized if not loneliness but certain safe distance from so-called society. It is perfectly ok to be alone from all that socially constructed reality they created for themselves. Like Tibetans said &quot;the hell is a not a place, but a consequence of behavior of inhabitants&quot;.<p>So loneliness is required, at least it is more bearable and natiral condition for those who is labeled as by society as &quot;introvert&quot; or &quot;autist&quot; or other words they cannot understand. Introversion is an effect, not a cause, and with good books, like &quot;Catcher&quot; cited by OP one is never alone, and it is a better condition than being &quot;social animal&quot; before TV set, or with a bottle on the street.",1392522011

Also I think it varies by age.  When you are in your 60&#x27;s, retiring, kids have grown and left, etc. I think that&#x27;s one of the most lonely times in the lives of Americans.  I watch my wife&#x27;s grandmother who lives with various children as is convenient for them, and she may not have a permanent home or a lot of stuff of her own, but she is happier than most Americans I have seen in retirement.  Having watched my own grandparents struggle with loneliness in retirement despite the fact that we have a reasonably close family by American standards is one of the reasons why I am relatively adamant that independent retirement is not a good thing.  But having lived in both kinds of cultures, I don&#x27;t think most of my fellow Americans are ready to make the tradeoffs that this would involve.<p>> Do you focus on your family or really close friends after twenties, or do you focus on pursuing your own ideas with a community of likely-minded people, or do you come up with some kind of philosophical reconciliation?<p>Yes to all three.  But I think there is also a feeling when you are in your 20&#x27;s that if you find that special someone you won&#x27;t be lonely anymore.  Well, that never really happens.  So you start having a family,  your social life constricts, and you find you are still lonely.  What you have to do is find communities of like-minded people who you can work with, and you also have to come to terms with the fact that having other people may be necessary to prevent loneliness but it is not sufficient, and at some point you have to learn to focus on what you have instead of what you don&#x27;t.",1392520379

At the same time, as someone who has overcome a lonely path, I can&#x27;t help but put a lot more emphasis on culture than on the others.<p>American culture is a lonely culture, as my wife is always pointing out.  We send our kids to college alone.  We retire alone.  We look at social problems like poverty as if they are held by the individual alone.  Loneliness is the price of freedom but it is also the price includes lack of real social and physical support.<p>When I moved to Indonesia two years ago, things went downhill with my marriage fast.  My wife was always threatening to send me back to the States (every couple weeks) and I couldn&#x27;t develop a sense of place in the midst of the uncertainty.  I felt like I was half-way around the world from anyone who cared about me except for the kids.  It was a very dark, depressing, and crippling place to be (business-wise, personally, and more).  And so things continued for most of two years.  Eventually we did overcome our problems (in no small part due to me eventually deciding I had to ignore her threats).<p>Here&#x27;s the basic thing.  It doesn&#x27;t take many people to combat loneliness.  Quality matters far more than quantity.  Getting out there and meeting people is a smallish part of the battle.

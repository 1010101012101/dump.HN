I've been telling anyone who would listen that most of the high-speed rail projects going in now will be seen as gigantic white elephants in 30 years. They'll be unable to service their debt due to low ridership and will become another nail in the coffin of government solvency.<p>It's not going to be just robo-cars, but efficient electrically powered robo-cars that make the difference. Even though they won't be quite as efficient as rail on a per-kilometer basis they will be able to take you point-to-point rather than having to transfer to a bus or rental car once you reach LA.<p>The other factor  which many of you seem to ignore  is that train travel kind of sucks with small children. You have to drive to the train station, then drag kids, strollers, diaper bags, etc onto the train, then repeat the process at your destination. Obviously it's doable to take the train but I would still prefer to have my own personal vehicle even if it costs a little more and takes a little longer.<p>The future of transportation is personalized and distributed.

I can code when not in The Zone, but there's NOTHING like the productivity you get when you're cranking out code.<p>He claims you'll be revisiting that code. So what? Maybe HIS code, written in The Zone, comes out as crap, but mine is as solid as my ""normal"" code. It's certainly better than my ""stay up all night until the bug is fixed"" code; THAT is something that I've stopped doing, thankfully, because when that happens I typically have to clean up a mess no matter how much of a slog the code was to write.<p>In fact, his comment that you'll come back to code written in The Zone more often is tautological if you end up writing most of your code that way, since bugs typically correlate to lines of code. You could have half as many bugs per line in your Zone code as the rest, and if 80% of your code is written in the Zone, it will still seem like you spend most of your time debugging it.<p>To be fair, I've also managed a Zen coding state that's not quite Zone, but not as painful as the state you describe.

3281878,comment,3280344,3280582,2,0,danmaz74,,,"The point is that Germany IS going to pay for the crisis anyway, because if Greece, Spain and Italy defaulted, the German banks would lose hundreds of billions of euros of German money. The European economy would enter a crisis that would last years (decades?), and most of German exports are to other European countries - thinking that they could have a great economy amid a European depression is just stupid. And I'm not even thinking about the possibility of wars should become ""everyone for himself"" in Europe again.<p>So, it isn't a matter of self interest vs. generosity: it is a matter of understanding that it would be MUCH less costly to make the ECB lender of last resort now than to wait and just hope that things will fix themselves.

3281874,comment,3280494,3281552,2,0,bobwaycott,,,"These are excellent points that get us closer to considering the question of when big companies are a good idea--especially #1. The ability to operate divisions at a loss and ride out a down economy is certainly an advantage had over the small firm who one might expect to be much harder hit when its core competency is hard pressed by external forces. So, one might be justified in saying a big company is a good idea when market forces bear negatively on participants, allowing the large firm to weather the storm less disastrously than a small firm. Of course, one can counter this proposition by arguing the large firm thus exhibits an unnaturally advantageous existence, not only bypassing but perhaps also eroding, perverting, retarding, and preventing evolution of the market in directions for which it is unprepared and in which it would lose its currently stronger standing. And yes, a similarly framed argument can be made <i>for</i> the large firm in the context of the evolution of markets--the larger, stronger company is the more fit, as evidenced by its ability to ride out market changes, retooling and repositioning itself for future success when the chaos dies down. However, I think it more likely this is only true as a result of its unfair advantage in having been large enough to not be naturally weakened & removed by the market as smaller firms are--because it is not removed from the market as a result of large concentrations of capital not possessed by smaller firms who are potentially better suited to adapt to changing conditions more rapidly but are forced out due to markets operating in line with extant large-firm bias (even when the market itself could benefit from the loss of the large firms).<p>#2 is, for me, quite close to the line of thinking offered in the OP, and of course the one I take issue with--it is more a statement of the way the market works now than a solid reason for why a big company is a good idea. I find this is a result of market players operating in such a manner as to give preferential treatment to a large company for reasons that don't actually equate to a larger company possessing this stronger negotiating position <i>a priori</i>. Rather, leveraging an existing preference that is itself an artificial construct (historically built by large firms) atop the market offers little in defense of why the large firm exists or is a good idea. In essence, the large firm enjoys a stronger negotiating position in the market because players in the market prefer to negotiate with a large firm because they believe it is in their best interest to do so because the large firm wields vastly larger capital with which it entices the players to negotiate with it over smaller players. This is circular and, in my view, ought then be discarded in attempts to explicate why this is a good idea.<p>#3 is a bit harder to pin down. I'm not convinced there is an inherent goodness in brand longevity as far as markets are concerned--or where employees, vendors, clients, or anyone else matters. I also find the material history of humanity and the markets replete with more examples of why leadership longevity is a bad thing than the reverse. There are certainly far more examples of long-term leaders ultimately driving their companies--large or small, it doesn't really matter--into relative oblivion or disarray or irrelevance than long-term leaders consistently innovating ahead of the markets, responding to changing conditions and rapidly correcting course so as to move forward. Leadership longevity often results in market players who have a vested interest in maintaining their position in the market through either coercion, prevention, or weathering out blips. It also can create companies who fail to change with the market because they believe <i>they</i> have it right and the <i>market</i> has it wrong. Perhaps in some cases this can be true ... but the perspective is always funny to me when people discuss ""correcting"" the market or some similar type of action. Correcting the market has always struck me as code for ""get the market back in line with the operational goals of the large firms who have been benefitting the most."" When the market moves against them, they seek correction and realignment. When the market moves toward them, they seek protection and cultivation.<p>Anyway, your points are far more interesting avenues to thoughtfully consider when big companies are a good idea. Not yet to the ""Why do large firms exist?"" question from the article yet, but at least getting closer to what I thought the author was going to do. And, we're still far from the question the author started the article with in the first place, of course.",1322375696

These include customer service skills, understanding the needs of a business intimately and learning how real business are run. The people that are passionate about doing IT in that context are far and few between. Since it's seen as a service job, it forces a lot of people into other disciplines after a couple of years behind the helldesk.<p>Many IT shops also fail at communication. There is a lot that we do behind the scenes and no IT shop i've been at is doing a decent job constantly reminding everyone why they are there. Organisations need to know what improvements IT is working on and how it will better serve their needs, and they need to get excited by it. People get excited when Apple introduces new technology, but they get less excited when suddenly they can log in everywhere with the same password. Market that better.<p>IT, Operations, DB and Co. will resent you for asking for things when they are already busy putting out fires, fulfilling all your other requests and being the whipping boys and girls of your organisation. Google is a notable exception because their IT department is far better managed than most. Make sure all your technical service departments are tightly aligned with the mission critical things in your org and make sure management is shielding them from requests that get in the way. The more focus the techs have on core things, the faster they get done and suddenly the more spare time they have to help you get your project done on time too. Time management and business planning is key here.<p>Finally quit this 'for the CEO' or 'for Alan' mentality. If someone's computer fails, it should be replaceable within a couple of hours. This special person who's making a larger salary than you should understand better than any one else, never be dependent on a single point of failure to run a business. This doesn't mean a CEO has to be a tech genius or your star programmer an IT genius. They should just be smart enough to ask their IT department ahead of time 'what do i do when my computer fails?'.",1322375307

To say that whether TDD is beneficial is an open question is putting it mildly.<p>Moreover, describing someone who doesn't buy the TDD hype as ""unprofessional"" is simply a crude <i>ad hominem</i> attack, which by the way targets almost all professional developers who do in fact work on software with bug rates an order of magnitude or more better than the industry average.<p><i>According to Robert C. Martin, if you work 40 hours a week, you should spend around 20 additional hours enhancing your own profession.</i><p>Ah, yes, I remember the management research about this one. It definitely showed that sustaining a 60-hour work week in a creative field was the best way to maintain performance, and found no negative consequences that quickly led to a net performance loss and ultimately to burn-out of the worker.<p><i>As a professional developer, you should know that being a software developer is a very intellectual and exhausting job.

If they do listen to you but then choose not to follow your recommendation, it is also their problem. Either way, you can if necessary ensure that your objections have been properly recorded, but it's almost certainly not your job as a software developer to second-guess a management decision and start playing levels of management off against each other.

</code></pre>
I think there's a couple typos in there. For example, you could have spelled it this way:<p><pre><code>    $ pip install smtproutes
</code></pre>
Using pip (<a href=""http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip</a>) makes you a better ecosystem contributor. Also, I noticed you're internally using asyncore, AKA Medusa. This is a Bad Idea, period; you won't scale and you're using what is essentially dead, horrid code. Consider rewording the statement entirely:<p><pre><code>    $ pip install Twisted
    $ twistd mail ...
</code></pre>
Now you have a <i>real</i> SMTP/POP3/IMAP server at your disposal.<p>But yeah, I'd so much rather that you not use asyncore. It makes us cry. I'd even let you keep easy_install if you compromise and drop asyncore!",1322374361

In this case, 'foo={}' is evaluated once, and returns a pointer to a dict(). After that, foo is always pointing to the same dict, not to a newly created empty dict.<p>Run this in a Python interpreter:<p><pre><code>  class PhoneBook(object):
    def __init__(self, names={}):
      self.names = names

  phonebook1 = PhoneBook()
  phonebook2 = PhoneBook()

  phonebook1.names['Bob'] = '+1 555 5555'

Sure, the money may not be much, but if you don't perceive a difference in quality, you'll buy the $.98 can of beans over the $.99 one. $115 is hardly a theoretical lower bound to the price of a PC.<p>There are also large organizations that would like to cut costs wherever they can, and can't be expected to make up the Windows tax by installing crapware like a vendor can. The city of Munich is the most well-known example of a big player switching to Linux. The effort was not a complete failure but was something of a disappointment - I don't think Munich ended up saving any money when you consider the labor costs, etc. But if Linux had been ready and the transition had been more successful, you'd see a lot of imitators following Munich's lead.<p>But it's probably a moot point anyway. I think Android will end up swallowing the PC market like a classic disruptive technology and stealing Linux's thunder anyway.",1322373698

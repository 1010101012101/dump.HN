If an investment requires active maintenance and management, it&#x27;s not for me (unless I&#x27;m doing it for charity). This excludes many common investments such real estate and stocks. With others (say fixed deposits, metals, etc.) the post-tax returns are less than inflation so it may not be wise. Right now I have decided to invest mostly in mutual funds.<p>I&#x27;m okay with the risk because the biggest asset I have is myself. The insecurity about future never leaves us, but as long as I believe that I would be employable in future, I can always jump back.<p>EDIT: added ?share=1 to the URL. Thanks Casseres.",1387875435

6958774,comment,6957311,6958575,5,0,RyanZAG,,,"Java is very heavily set on backwards compatibility - no new feature is allowed to affect existing code and any new features must fit into the existing features. This is different to Python for example where they had backwards incompatible changes in v3.<p>Another issue is the depth of the process on each change: there are a number of discussions on each feature with multiple proposals to determine the best way to implement any feature and how it will fit in, etc. The number of companies and people involved in the feature design and implementation in each change is generally an order of magnitude greater than those other languages.<p>Comes down to heavy bureaucracy and design by committee creating a very long process - but the end result is generally extremely well thought through and tested, so I&#x27;m personally not complaining since I&#x27;m not footing the bill.",1387875323

Where were the technological improvements when oil shot up to $150 in 2008 ?<p>Sure technological improvements eventually got us to the energy level we were at in 2005 ... but only just barely and only for a week. Since then it&#x27;s been going down, with predictable results.<p>And while shale (currently) provides a few years delay, it&#x27;s only for a few years, and maybe even only America. That&#x27;s the problem with these ass-saving technologies. The first few times they saved our ass for several centuries (coal + trains, which will keep working, later nuclear). The next revolution saved our collective energy-hogging asses for ~60 years. The next one, horizontal drilling, did for ~10-15 years. Now we have shale oil, which saves our asses for 5-6 years tops.<p>The situation is not as rosy as you indicate at all. We&#x27;re effectively dependent on ALL technologies operating at totally maxed out capacity for economic prosperity, and a lot of these technologies are faltering all at the same time. It won&#x27;t be pretty.<p>Frankly we have ~5 years to increase the efficiency of batteries (which have improved a factor 2 in ~100 years in mass/energy and volume/energy). Not by a factor of 2, but a factor of 10, to keep our society at the same technological level. Nobody has any even theoretical ideas to get a twofold improvement. We only have 5 years because of shale oil, and we knew perfectly well in 2000 that we&#x27;d need this super-battery before the decade was out, and humanity simply failed ...<p>I went to a robotic mechanics lecture 2 years ago. The opening line was this : you climbed 5 floors to get here, and you got seriously tired (the elevators were out). If you had been the best robot we have, with roughly half it&#x27;s weight dedicated to battery you would have just used ~50% of the total energy contents of your battery. This is a problem that needs to be solved before we have any real hope of true independent robots.<p>Oh and let&#x27;s feel inspired by nature. Wait. How does nature solve this ? Well, here&#x27;s the basic formula for oil CnH2n+2. Here&#x27;s the basic formula for human fat : CnH2nOOH. In both cases the energy is stored in the same chemical structure. The energy is pretty much stored in the exact same chemical bonds in the human body (or any animal) and in a gas tank. In other words : in 4 billion years evolution did not find a better way. Do you think humanity is likely to improve upon it ?<p>You best hope so. Or we&#x27;ll see repeats of 2008, except without recovery.",1387873805

Years after it&#x27;s barely useful anymore, even though battery tech has gotten so good it surpasses the internal combustion engine dollar for dollar even ignoring the tax credits, there&#x27;ll be a lab buried away still burning it for <i>something.</i> And finally, some day, the last drop — or at least, the last easily-recoverable natural drop – of oil will be burned.<p>But, to be honest, it won&#x27;t really matter.<p>The scariest energy-related crisis facing us in the foreseeable future isn&#x27;t the inability to burn oil or other cheap but dirty energy sources: it&#x27;s the ease with which everyone currently does burn them, slowly but surely smothering, melting, and then freezing the planet.

You can end up making something really weird if you don&#x27;t take your time and try to push it all out in one go. Allow your brain time to digest what you are doing in in the background while you do other things.<p>Other helpful tips:<p>Combine actions as much as possible without being confusing. If you have a flow that is 3 or 4 pages/actions long for a mechanism that is relatively simple - you dun goof&#x27;d. I like to aim for one CTA per action but I will settle for two, three if the action is relatively complex (but all cases are different - there are no rules).<p>Spacing and consistency make things look polished - it&#x27;s &#x27;not important&#x27; as far as functionality goes but it goes a long way for making people want to use your product. It also gives subtle clues as to the pattern or template they should follow to get to the next action. As in: if the CTA button is usually at the bottom but then for some reason it shows up in the middle or the top you are breaking the &#x27;shape&#x27; the user expects to encounter while progressing through your app or site or whatever.<p>Same for text entry fields, buttons, or text fields - unless you have a good reason to change their location, keep similar things in the similar locations, keep similar mechanisms the same size as each other and have everything act as consistently as you can.<p>Keep it simple. If you hand it to someone and they just freeze and ask what they should do, you need to go back and make it more clear.",1387872546

6958677,comment,6953568,6958149,1,0,peterfoldi,,,"> I think that saying you can &#x27;learn Haskell in a week&#x27; is really short sighted. You can learn to parse a Haskell program and write a guess-the-number program in a week, but learning how to write good Haskell is going to take months, if not years.<p>That was exactly my point, sorry if it wasn&#x27;t clear.<p>>  Really learning Haskell as an experienced programmer took as long as it took to learn Python as a novice, and I&#x27;ve heard similar reports from other people. I certainly agree that if you know, say, Java, learning C# probably isn&#x27;t going to maximize your &#x27;skill increase per time&#x27;. But saying that going from Java to Haskell, or even farther to something super-weird like Agda or Forth or Prolog, is just as easy as going from Java to C# is just wrong.<p>I am not saying that the &quot;Java after C#&quot; learning curve is the same as &quot;Haskell after C#&quot;. It isn&#x27;t. But I believe that the general experience of abstract thinking that one learns in many years must give an advantage over a novice learner. I am not talking about a script-kiddie who spent five years hacking code, or somebody who has the same one year experience 20 times instead of real 20 year experience. I believe that if you spent your development life actively then you must get a new concept easier than a beginner. And not only that. Concepts of a paradigm or language leak into others. Linq in .Net leverages &quot;monads&quot;. Eric Meijer, one of the creators of Linq, loves Haskell and they borrowed ideas from Haskell. Now, if one is a &quot;too pragmatic&quot; programmer, they can use Linq for years successfully and never get closer to understand monads. However is one takes the time and looks behind the curtains, they got closer to understand at least this one concept of Haskell. And I am pretty sure that over let&#x27;s say 10 years you are exposed to many ideas in some way if you keep your eyes open.<p>As I said, my gut feeling (can&#x27;t tell how good the estimation is) is that in about six months I &quot;get Haskell and fp&quot;. But it&#x27;s not black or white: obviously spending 6 more years in the fp world would make a difference. There must be a decision made (and here I agree with gfodor) when the further gain doesn&#x27;t justify the investment. I won&#x27;t stop at 6th month if I don&#x27;t feel the power yet :)",1387872210

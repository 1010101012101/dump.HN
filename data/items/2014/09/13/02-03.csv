8311505,comment,8311158,8311158,6,0,coreymgilmore,,,"I have two thoughts on Apple Pay:<p>1) Android has had cardless payment for 2+ years now via Google Wallet.  That being said, Japan has had similar technology for way longer.  While the marketing machine that is Apple made sure to let everyone know how magical/revolutionary/awesome/brilliant this form of payment it, Apple is late to the game.  Similarly, other products such as Softcard/ISIS exist too from non-smartphone companies.  Thanks Apple for finally catching up.<p>2) Apply Pay will, however, finally give cardless payment the push it needs.  Apple has the market power to get retailers to start (read: more than rarely) embrace this technology (for example: Passbook & tickets).  That I can fully support Apple for as the iPhone is the single best selling phone and will get NFC into the hands of millions very, very quickly.  And with the volume of devices + Apple&#x27;s marketing of Apple Pay = great news for payment.",1410576835

This is why D is usually recommended as a secondary supplement to take with Calcium (or is usually bundled with Calcium).<p><i>However</i>, if you&#x27;re like me, you <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> take D as you don&#x27;t want to suffer from Hypercalcemia. It&#x27;s really hard to diagnose until somebody bothers to do a blood test for elevated calcium and presents as basic aches and pains at first, and as it gets worse turns into all kinds of weird mood, fatigue and sleep disorders.<p>Hypercalcemia can be deadly if left untreated and is not pleasant to have. Hypercalcemia can damage your central nervous system, lead to untreatable depression and cognitive dysfunction and eventually coma and cardiac arrest. Fortunately, I had a good doctor who caught it when I was complaining of constant fatigue, muscle weakness and nerve issues in my face and thought to check for it. At the time I was in grad school and working full-time so I just thought it was poor sleep habits. I was also taking 5,000 IU/day of Vitamin D thinking it would help my mood a bit.<p>There&#x27;s a bunch of other copresent medical issues with hypercalcemia, so if you catch one, you might catch the other, and fortunately treating one can help with all the others.<p>These days, normal D enriched foods are fine for me as they don&#x27;t come close to the high levels of D I was taking before, but I try to moderate D and Calcium rich foods a little.",1410575634

But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s particularly related to randomness - Monte Carlo is only needed to integrate the distribution.<p>Ah, that&#x27;s an interesting distinction, thanks. I&#x27;ll have to think about this some more. But given a situation where exact integration is intractable (like chess or Go), I&#x27;m not too sure what the difference really is, because it is those cases (on first thought) where the uniform distribution is useful--if you can see to the end, you don&#x27;t need to care about bias, right? I mean, &quot;randomness&quot; in the strictest sense is not really necessary; all these programs I speak of used deterministic pseudorandom generators of course. It&#x27;s really just about ensuring lack of bias given finite sampling. I&#x27;m happy to hear your take on it though--you definitely seem to have a lot more knowledge of math/statistics/etc. than I do.<p>(That does remind me of another fascinating tidbit from the Go world: programmers noticed that using a low-quality PRNG, like libc&#x27;s LCG rand(), produced significantly weaker players than more evenly-distributed PRNGs, even though it would seem that playing lots of random games of indeterminate length (with the PRNG called at least once per move) would not correlate at all with the PRNG&#x27;s distribution.)<p>The adversarial-or-not issue is also good food for thought. I&#x27;m not convinced that it explains much in this case, though, since I believe most of these observations were made by playing computer-computer games with each program using very similar algorithms, or with old hand-tuned programs against the newer Monte-Carlo based programs.",1410574725

They have no corporeal existence. There is no computation you can do that will get the golf ball into the hole.<p>> And as fabrication technology is becoming more sophisticated this fact is starting to become more obvious in practice.<p>Using a 3D printer to make a patented golf club is clearly patent infringement. Widespread availability of fabrication technology is certainly going to make <i>enforcing</i> certain patents much more difficult in the same way that it has for copyright but what does that have to do with patentability?<p>> No one patented modular exponentiation, they patented an encryption algorithm that employs modular exponentiation. That is a distinction with a real difference.<p>It&#x27;s the same piece of code. Math has no particular intent.<p>> All patents have this type of construction. The same argument could be used to assert that all chemical process patents are patenting common chemistry or facts of nature.<p>No one is disputing that anything can be described by math. The point is that the math is different from the thing it describes. A chemical process is not itself math. An algorithm is.<p>A good way to understand it is to realize that a physical thing can be used as a &quot;computer&quot; to execute the mathematical algorithm describing its behavior but the reverse is not the case. You can calculate &#x27;E&#x27; in &quot;E=mc^2&quot; by setting up a nuclear reaction that will convert a mass &#x27;m&#x27; into energy &#x27;E&#x27; and measuring the energy that is produced. You can perform the same calculation using a general purpose computer. So the algorithm/formula &quot;E=mc^2&quot; can be executed on a nuclear reactor or on a smartphone. But doing the calculation without the nuclear reaction will not actually produce &#x27;E&#x27; joules of energy that could be used to e.g. drive a steam turbine. That&#x27;s the difference.",1410574716

My take was (paraphrased) if you make it somewhat expensive (ie. proof of work) to get into the network it makes it less likely people would go to the trouble.<p>One direction I&#x27;ve been pushing toward is (ignore the impractical nature of the solution for a moment) what if folks within the network were somehow invested in the integrity of the system somehow.  If there were incentive not just to participate in the network but to ensure all actors they interact with are real people.  So as folks &quot;confirm&quot; one another by signing digital signatures (or something along these lines) you build up a crowd-sourced effort to ensure the identities of other actors within the network.<p>Put all the identities / confirmation data into a blockchain and all of a sudden heuristics and statistical analysis can be used to begin dissecting the data to tell members of the network the probability that a given actor within the network is real or not.<p>In more practical terms, the idea is along the lines of some analysis I&#x27;ve seen in the past about Twitter accounts, and how a huge percentage of fake accounts are only interconnected among themselves, and not interconnected among real people.

The &quot;evidence base&quot; remains unsettled, and there&#x27;s a wide range of interpretations of the ideal range for vitamin D levels or intake.  The conservative recommended level is 20 ng/ml, but there is substantial opinion that the minimal level of 20 ng/ml is way too low, and that 40 to 60 ng/ml is consistent with historic human environmental conditions.<p>Here&#x27;s my take on the subject.  Depending on where you live, it may be important or not.  I agree with the comments here: the further north you reside, the greater the risk of inadequate body level of vitamin D and attendant health consequences.<p>At my location just north of the 45th parallel, I order D levels frequently and about half of patients show D level <30.  (Reference range: 30-100 ng/ml.)  Low levels have been associated with many conditions, but I&#x27;d point out cognitive dysfunction and depressed mood as less widely known effects.<p>Vitamin D is an enzyme co-factor at rate-limiting steps in pathways of CNS neurotransmitters synthesis. Negative effects on brain functioning are a logical consequence of D deficiency.<p>Human populations indigenous to arctic regions have only a few months a year of enough UVB exposure for synthesis of D in the skin.  Yet they have survived at far north locations for a millennium.  How is that possible?  Consider their diet, very high in fish and seafood, e.g., 100g of salmon contains around 350 IU of D, so easily intake >=2000 IU/day.<p>We recommend D supplementation of 2000 IU/day and calcium 1g/day for most people who live north of 40th parallel, especially people living in rainy coastal climates.<p>Vitamin D toxicity can develop with super-high doses of D.  I&#x27;ve seen it a few times, but only with very high amounts (>10kIU/day) over months of excessive intake.  At any reasonable amount, say 5kIU/day, toxicity is very unlikely.  In any case it&#x27;s easy to check blood level if a reason to suspect it and advise accordingly.",1410573687

Such as janitorial services - there&#x27;s no automation there, the janitor with a mop and a bucket is doing the same thing he&#x27;s done for decades.<p>I don&#x27;t think that is true. Look at the tech and machinery a janitor uses to day vs what would have been used in the 70&#x27;s. Plus, nowadays buildings are often designed to make janitorial work in them as efficient as possible. There are certainly many fewer janitors / m^2 building area today than in the 70&#x27;s so in a way you can janitors productivity has increased a lot.<p>In my apartment a water pipe broke recently which required immediate attention from a repairman otherwise it would have caused a flood. The closest one working standby which was dispatched by the landlord was over 20 km away. So for an apartment population of 200k+ you have only 2-3 repairmen servicing emergency problems. That&#x27;s incredibly efficient.",1441353520

10169190,comment,10165586,10166315,0,0,Animats,,,"Without &quot;great men&quot;, computer progress might have ground along something like this, in tiny steps.<p>IBM had been building tabulators for decades. But they just added and subtracted.  Mechanical desk calculators had been built that could multiply and divide.  Those came together in the IBM 602A Calculating Punch of 1946.
A multiply in only a few seconds!  Division, too. You could even do Newton&#x27;s method by wiring the plugboard appropriately.<p>The limits of gear-driven arithmetic having been reached, IBM tried using vacuum tubes, and produced the IBM 603 Multiplier.  This was roughly equivalent to a 602A, but it used tubes.  It was a trial to find out if tubes would work in a fielded product; only 100 were built. They did.  So IBM went on to the 604, which was like a 603 with more registers and more program steps.<p>Meanwhile, crystal radios had been around for decades, and germanium diodes followed as a cleaned-up form of those diodes.  Some experimenters had fooled around with 3-terminal solid state devices; Lilienfeld patented one in 1925.  But until materials processing improved, nobody could make one consistently.  Only when germanium diodes were badly needed for WWII radar was that materials problem solved. The transistor followed.<p>So IBM kept plugging along. Next was the IBM 608, which was sort of like a 604, but with transistors.  Then came the 609, which was like a 608, but faster.  There hadn&#x27;t been any conceptual change from the gear and relay era, but the hardware was getting much better.  All these machines used decimal arithmetic.<p>Meanwhile, magnetic recording was coming along. There were wire recorders in the 1930s, tape recorders in the 1940s, and by 1944, Ampex was making some good ones.  The first digital tape drive was a project for Arlington Hall, a predecessor of NSA.<p>In the 1940s through the 1960s, there were many special purpose machines that were almost computers, but not quite.  American Totalizator had machines for racetracks. (They later invested in UNIVAC). Teleregister had machines for stockbrokers, and later, the first airline reservation system, Reservisor. There were ticketing systems for railroads.  There was a huge piece of electronics built by AT&T to process phone long distance billing records; all it really did was match call start and call end data on special paper tapes, then punch a card for each completed call.  None of these were stored-program computers as we think of them today.<p>No big breakthroughs in this line of development yet; just incremental improvements.<p>The plugboards were a pain, and it was widely recognized that some better way to store programs and data would be a big help.  Lots of things were tried - acoustic delay lines, drums, storage CRTs, magnetic core memory, plated wire memory...  Magnetic cores were invented separately by several people, appearing about the same time in a British computer, an MIT computer, and a Seeburg jukebox.  They were expensive, but worked.<p>IBM kept plugging away, producing the IBM 650, which was a programmable computer in the modern sense, but was mostly an upgrade path from the 604/609 series.  Through the 1950s and early 1960s, IBM kept coming out with new and better models.  There was a &quot;business&quot; line, with decimal arithmetic, and a &quot;scientific&quot; line, with binary arithmetic.  Some of the programming arrangements were strange by modern standards; look up how the IBM 1401 did variable-length arithmetic with &quot;word marks&quot;, how the 1620 had a decimal multiplication table in memory, and the strange addressing of the IBM 650.<p>Then IBM decided they had too many incompatible products, and developed the IBM System/360 family.  One range of machines, all more or less compatible, with both binary and decimal arithmetic for both the scientific and business markets. Floating point, even.  And a new way to make components - IBM Solid Logic Technology, individual transistors and other components placed into ceramic substrates by automated machinery.  It wasn&#x27;t quite an IC, but it was getting close. IBM now had something that looks pretty much like today&#x27;s computers.  Small and cheap were in the future, but the architecture had settled down.  Binary arithmetic, byte-oriented, random-access memory, a reasonable instruction set, and a modest number of CPU registers had emerged as the winning architecture.<p>The early days were mostly about incremental improvement like that.  Without Turing or Von Neumann, all this would have happened anyway.",1441352240

Then ssh&#x27;ing into my desktop PC whenever I needed to run the scripts on the full data set.<p>I considered adding a section on open science and cloud-based software to my thesis, but in the end decided not to due to a lack of time. Open science is based on open source principles, where everything that can be shared should be shared. The Cloud VM angle is quite interesting in this sense, as being able to share the machines that software for a research project was ran on is often quite difficult (or nigh impossible), and a cloud-based VM seems to bridge this gap somewhat. In theory, anyone could log-in to the VM and play around in the workspace I set up for my thesis project, not that many would want to I suppose.",1441352024

10169172,comment,10168599,10168599,0,0,eip,,,"Biologists have presented you with some startling evidence that living creatures change themselves dramatically 
to ensure their survival in a particular environment. Life is self adapting. An insect in the Amazon playas has wings that look exactly like the flowers of the tree upon which it thrives. A bird has a beak that is shaped exactly right to gather nectar deep within a particular flower in its forest. A beetle puffs itself up to double its size to frighten off predators. Most plants, animals and insects have unique biological anomalies that ensure its life cycle in a very special place. How did the creature know how to 
change itself so accurately? Can you suppose that a moth is smarter than you; that it can alter its own DNA?<p>The butterfly, whose wings look like flowers, has eyes and a sense of logic, and certainly a desire to stay alive being a butterfly. Its simple desire went forth as a signal to alert a greater intelligence who, by law, was able to assist the DNA change in exactly the way the butterfly had described. The butterfly literally said to itself, in butterfly language, “If I were to look exactly like these flowers where I spend my happy hours feeding, the predators would not see me here and I could avoid a horrible death.” And so it was. Desire propels a signal to where it needs to go.<p>Humans use the same adaptive biological process, but they are often slowed down by  traditions and lack of trust. If a human wants to fly he settles for an airplane - because he has learned to understand and trust airplanes. It is possible that a human could grow wings and fly.  And then again, he wants to remain a “human”. He is literally afraid of radical change from what his ideal “humanness” is like. The butterfly wanted to remain a butterfly, but one that looked like a flower. The human is very limited by his 
ideals. A human could live 300 years, but then he would look funny and old and everyone would hate him - he thinks.<p>We would like to propose that the joys of humanness could be presented in an attractive but radically different manner. If you could know yourself as a Creator Wave Form that kept your personality and identity intact, you might find it quite interesting to change forms, to alter your appearance at will. Think about what opportunities might be in the cosmos to accommodate your desires. Owls and alligators remain unchanged over millions of years. Why?  Because they were so successful and happy being owls and alligators that they stayed that way.  Dissatisfaction has many advantages. This is not a joke. Think about how you might want to change. Believe that you can.",1441351867

Birds did not engineer flight, we did, and we were only able to engineer a crude version of it. The natural abilities of flight in birds are still superior in many ways to engineered flight. So, how can we assume from this that we&#x27;ll be able to build a version of ourselves that&#x27;s completely more intelligent?<p>Humans engineering functional variants of inferior species&#x27; physical capabilities is undeniably incomparable to humans engineering a better, more intelligent version of ourselves.  Maybe, a beneficial albeit simpler version can be engineered, but one that makes us obsolete? It&#x27;s hard for me to conclude that&#x27;s not a huge leap in assumption.",1441350012

But, I do consider it unethical, and it's something I would not take part in.<p>I'm OK with honest gambling...payouts of 85% to 95%, as found in Las Vegas.  I'm not OK with lotteries (which are legal, and in fact operated by the government, but I consider them unethical for the same reason...they prey on those least able to understand the odds and the costs, and those who most desperately need money).  At least in the case of lotteries it contributes to some sort of common good (states usually say it is for schools; ""think of the children!"").

610042,comment,609822,609822,0,0,tvon,,,"This is silly.<p>First off, an IRC channel does not speak for a whole community of users, and an IRC channel that covers a topic that a subset of a community is interested in certainly doesn't cover whole community of users. I mean, Python isn't PHP, it has a lot of uses outside of web development and they don't know or care about the feelings of the #django and they probably don't know what this ""magic"" thing is either.<p>Even so, nobody in the world should ever say ""Wow"" to anything anyone ever does on IRC.  It's all happend before, it will all happen again, it's filthy, it's nasty, it's IRC.<p>Or to paraphrase a great character:<p><pre><code>    IRC.  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.\n\n</code></pre>\nAt any rate, so far as I can tell the author doesn't know Django very well, which is fine, I don't know it that well either, but rejecting ""simple solution #1"" that requires writing:<p><pre><code>    login_required(some_view)\n</code></pre>\nInstead of<p><pre><code>    login_required('some_view')\n</code></pre>\nBecause you want to specify <i>all</i> your views by module path strings instead of actually importing one... that's just silly.  What is wrong with importing a view to pass it to a method?  Nothing, as a fan of Python for the past ~8 years, nothing is wrong with that, it's simple, it works, do it.  If it offends your sensibilities, well, your sensibilities are silly.<p>Never mind the ""simple solution #2"" (in the comments by ez, but someone on IRC should have thought of it):<p><pre><code>    @login_required\n    def limited_object_list(*args, **kwargs):\n        return object_list(*args, **kwargs)\n\n</code></pre>\nYes, crazy simple, a tiny, itsy-bitsy wrapper that does exactly what you need it to do and lets you keep your urls.py looking how you want it to.  That would have been my route (although once you have to write actual view code you might as well write your own view, after all the generic views are just there to solve common use cases and they are called ""generic"" views instead of ""customizable and flexible"" views for a reason.. besides, they are easy to reproduce if you need more complex view logic).<p>So, instead of the <i>existing</i>, <i>simple</i> and <i>working</i> solutions the author wants to add a login_required argument to every generic view, instead of just using the <i>existing</i>, <i>simple</i> and <i>working</i> solutions?<p>Yeah, that makes sense.",1242361890

I think it was Sligo where someone pointed out a local millionaire's house.  It was just another house on the row, and the guy lived a quiet life and still went to the local pub.  He didn't fear his neighbors, and his neighbors weren't stressed out by his wealth, including the chap who pointed all this out to me, who happened to be on the Dole!<p>I also note a marked difference between wait staff in Houston, Texas and Cincinnati, Ohio.  Waitresses and waiters seem to be much more servile in Houston, whereas in Cincinnati, I was often simply asked what I wanted.  Houston is markedly more affluent as a whole, however.<p>I too think that the problem lies in an underclass that feels ""captive.""

3882054,comment,3881827,3881827,2,0,DrJokepu,,,"I think one of the hardest part of login views and other forms in iOS is dealing with the keyboard. You don't want the keyboard to hide stuff but you also don't want emptiness where they keyboard would be when the keyboard is not visible. Also they size of the keyboard is not fixed. In this particular case, the input accessory view of some keyboards, such as the Japanese keyboard would overlap with the button. In the case of a login view, you want to trigger a login event when the user touches the Done button as opposed to making the UITextField resign its first responder status, which means that on the iPhone the user won't be able to dismiss the keyboard, so all the other login options as well as the sign up button will be hidden forever if the user changes his mind. Ultimately, you want to have the whole thing in a UIScrollView (or a UITableView) to avoid such problems. And leave more space for the keyboard.",1335232793

Programmers usually don't enjoy the process of estimating and so don't do it properly<p>c. Previous estimates are usually not shared amongst programmers<p>To elaborate.<p>a. There is usually pressure from managers or clients to come up with <i>quick</i> 'ballpark' estimates but only treat them as such when they don't fit their plans. So say they want something done in under 6 days. If you estimate a day ... there might be no questions asked, until you start blowing deadlines. But if you estimate 10 days, then a lot of people will quibble with you, trying to pressure you to give rationale or otherwise reduce the estimate.<p>As the poster shows, properly estimating something is actually a pretty involved process that means constructing the thing you're trying to build on paper (or in your head). Clients/bosses don't want to pay for that time, so devs are implicitly pressured to underestimate things, to avoid long discussions about unfavorable estimates.<p>b. Teeing off of a. clearly building the damned thing is way more fun than constructing it in your brain, estimating it, then going back and forth with clients on each line item as described above. There isn't a particular process, and sometimes you might actually spend almost half of the time of the estimate actually figuring out how to do it. Devs simply don't like estimating things, so they make (bad) guesses that seem safe but eventually turn out way wrong.<p>On a project I had once, I hated the work so much that I simply took a wild guess at how long it would take to do one particularly hairy bit and doubled it. Seemed totally safe at the time ... figured I'd be under by a lot. Turned out being even double that estimate ... the culprit ... Internet explorer.<p>c. If you go to a mechanic shop to get an estimate for work on your car, you might find that the mechanics go into a computer, plug in some details about your car and the problem ... and the computer spits out a number. This is because lots of things with cars are pretty routine ... Software isn't like that ... stuff that's routine is usually pulled out into plugins and frameworks that just work ... so we're constantly tackling problems that <i>seem</i> new, throw in the capabilities and weaknesses of particular frameworks, plugins or programming languages and you can see how these sorts of things can get away from you very quickly.<p>Programmers don't share their estimates with each other (hint hint), so the only really reliable source of good estimates tends to be personal experience, which is another reason why you should code ... a lot.<p>The only really good process I've found is to completely wireframe what needs to be done, (either that or build a clickable prototype that works exactly the way they want it to work). Then provide an estimate for that. But that doesn't always work for smaller things like bug fixes or smaller features.",1335231187

Going direct to affiliate programs in addition to adsense is going to benefit you as well - connectcommerce, linkshare, cj.com, etc. It'll take time to find products that have affiliate links that you're mentioning. Make sure you read the adsense terms carefully. There are restrictions as to what you can run in conjunction.<p>Are there books you can refer to? bn.com and amazon.com have decent affiliate programs - amazon is a bit easier as you have a lot more than just books that you can promote. If you review books and provide recommendations from your 'library', you might be able to make that work.<p>However, none of these are short term fixes. And you're probably not in a position to do arbitrage. You might look at the terms that are related to CF and use those keywords to build your articles around.<p>I don't think you could start today and have a good chance of bringing in much more than $20-$50 in the next 30 days, but, most payouts don't occur until you reach $100, 30 days after the period, etc. which suggests 90-120 days before you would be likely to see a first check.<p>kickstarter, kiva, gofundme and a number of other sites might also be reasonable.<p>Kickstarter - perhaps ask for funding to create an alternative/homeopathic CF site. Kiva is a crowdsourced loan site, gofundme is more of a 'donate to this person in need'.<p>Alternatively, are there health sites that would hire you as an author, or, could you leverage one of those sites as a free contributor and push traffic back to your site?",1335229950

Perhaps owing to their more academic interests, developers were punished for their perceived arrogance when younger and have now learned to adopt a mentality of weakness. As if somehow learning to code was some sort of cosmic mistake on your behalf? You're fortunate? Really? ""Oh yeah, my professional success is luck, I was out drinking one night and woke up the next day writing compilers!"".<p>No, I refuse to accept that notion. It may not be 'politically correct' to say this, but I believe you are to a very large extent responsible for your personal success and failures (At least growing up in the industrial world). The radical success of large population groups in countries with virtually no natural resources (Japan) and abject failure of countries more resource blessed than any other (Congo) is more than enough statistical evidence to support the notion that, yes, planning and hard work fixes hard luck.<p>But to address your Music jab, let me tell you a story.<p>A good friend of mine is named Max, he's only a few months older than me and it's certainly true that he is very passionate about music, he lives for it you could say. He is one of the hardest working people I know. He possesses no special skill, in fact, he just started learning to play guitar. However, he wanted to be involved very badly, so much so that he worked hard to learn to program and hustled by writing artistic music apps. That little bit of hustle and horizontal thinking got him far, really far. Now he plays with the eminent artist Bjork and regularly posts pictures of living the dream (At least of many 20 year old boys :). He was just playing on the Colbert Show on January 30th! Through hard work and intellectual pursuit, he has succeeded where so many others have failed, without connections and without privilege.<p>I also have two other friends, whose names you will not know and probably will never know who play many instruments quite well, both coming from decidedly upper middle class backgrounds, both of course claiming to have worked very hard, but all and all did nothing meaningful throughout my entire time knowing them. One of them is an English Major, the other a Nissan Lot Technician in Arizona.<p>Sure, you might be saying, ""Oh, great, yet <i>another</i> anecdote"", but I have a feeling that eventually you're going to see so many anecdotes that they stop being anecdotes.",1335229366

3881888,comment,3880837,3880837,3,0,bane,,,"Hangul is an astonishingly good alphabet. If it has a problem it's that it's too tightly coupled to its host language.<p>as codyrobbins already alluded to <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3881388"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3881388</a><p>it expresses the particulars of Korean extremely well, while only so-so mapping to the particulars of other languages. English, as a common example, is a mess in Hangul. It's readable, sometimes with a bit of effort, but completely obliterates certain sounds that have important meanings, or is forced to add other sounds where there simply is none in English (consonant consonant groupings in English end up rendered as consonant vowel consonant in many cases, usually with the all purpose  (eu) vowel).<p>I've also long wondered how much of the verbal features of modern Korean is merely a reflection of written Hangul. Much like how English speakers will overemphasize the 't' in 'water' when the spoken form is really a soft 'd'. The hard coupling of spoken Korean to Hangul may help overemphasize certain language features that may not have existed in earlier forms.<p>Despite all this there's an effort to try and adapt Hangul to languages with similar vowel consonant features. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cia-Cia_language"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cia-Cia_language</a><p>If you think that's strange, regard Latin, Greek, Arabic and Chinese w/r to Western Europe, Eastern Europe & Russia, the Middle East and Central Asia and East Asia respectively.<p>Some other interesting notes, modern Hangul is a little simpler than the original form. There's quite a few consonants that have been dropped, and various consonant clusters (many of which make more sense when transliterating foreign languages into Korean as noted above, so it's sad they're gone). However, this makes learning it far easier.<p>It's alleged that King Sejong created and funded what we'd know today as a linguistic R&D program as a way of improving literacy and education in the country after a plague killed a great number of his subjects. The connection? A treatment for the plague was printed and disseminated throughout the country but the low literacy rate (you had to know how to read and speak Chinese to understand the information) resulted in low adoption of the treatment.<p>However, for quite some time (a few hundred years) it was overcome by politics and never adopted as the official written form of the language, not really being standardized or formalized to fit the modern dialect until the early 20th century!<p>It's really worthwhile to learn it if you travel to Korea, or even live in an area with a large Korean population. Why? Once you learn the names of a few foods, it's much easier to read them in Hangul and learning new words (and how to pronounce them) is <i>much</i> easier than learning them via transliteration.",1335229205

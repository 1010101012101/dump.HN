It&#x27;s built on _top_ of the existing Go build system. It augments it, doesn&#x27;t replace it or replicate what&#x27;s already there.<p>Go has tools for building at master; godep adds a file that keeps track of explicit commits and creates a sandbox GOPATH with those revisions checked out. Nothing you couldn&#x27;t do by hand; godep simply automates the task, making it reproducible.<p>The reason Go doesn&#x27;t have everything is because the developers haven&#x27;t found a very good solution for everything. So instead of providing something crappy, they just don&#x27;t include it... Until a later time.

Whos watching their children while theyre away?<p>I was born and raised in Zimbabwe (where the bush/wilderness is very similar to that of Kenya) and this specific quote really shows the good and the bad of technology and innovation. Those women walk miles to get water; technology can now use pipes or boreholes to bring water closer to people - giving them a slightly easier life. However, Bill fails to mention how these women approach this hardship - having come across many of these people during my hikes in youth I can testify that they are singing and laughing for the entire duration of those daily ordeals. You simply won&#x27;t find a person with that attitude towards hardship in the first world/technology world. Their lives are hard, but they are happy. Our lives are easy, but the first world is struggling with depression[1]. Us people in the first world need to stop making the mistake of assuming that a hard life is an unhappy one. Bring these people water, bring them food, bring them vaccines - but don&#x27;t destroy one of the last bastions of happiness on the planet with the internet and laziness.<p>As for their children and who is looking after them: they are looking after each other, playing in the dirt and in the sun, making their own toys out of sticks, old tires and coat hanger wire [2][3]. What are <i>your</i> children doing? Sitting on an iPad? Their parents don&#x27;t have to worry about psychopaths or kidnappers - that is a first world problem in a very real way.<p>I&#x27;m a saying that what Bill is doing is wrong? No: he is making a very real and very positive difference in these people&#x27;s lives. What I am saying is that us people in the first world need to stop assuming that technology solves problems. The reality is that technology <i>replaces</i> problems with other problems.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.inquisitr.com/129438/depression-rates-higher-in-wealthier-countries/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inquisitr.com/129438/depression-rates-higher-in-w...</a>

After all, retirement funds add at least one layer of indirection between the person who ultimately owns something (in this case, the person saving for retirement) and the economic decisions being made.<p>That is, retirement funds dilute responsibility.<p>If you wanted to analyse this whole issue seriously, you&#x27;d have to consider two separate effects: (a) private retirement funds as the normative default creates a glut of capital and (b) private retirement funds allocate their money with rather little personal involvement and responsibility. [1]<p>As to the first point, things are more clear-cut. Yes, in a direct distribution system your pension depends on the future state of the economy. But so does your pension if you have retirement savings! After all, where does the growth of X% that you speak of come from?<p>Ultimately, no matter what the system, your pension has to come from <i>somewhere</i>. The fact that this somewhere is obscured by a retirement funds system is not a point in its favour - quite the opposite, actually. Transparent systems are always preferable.<p>[1] Yes, fund managers often are paid somewhat in relation to the success of the fund. Two problems with this: This incentive tends to focus on the short term, which is opposed to the interests of the future pensioners, and fund managers have more of an incentive to increase their volume rather than increase the quality with which they manage that volume (just like real estate brokers, with a nod to Freakonomics).",1384333403

Especially the towns that are on the sea and get a lot of tourists.<p>It usually goes like this:<p>1. Hey my friend, where are you from?  So that he can set an initial price for you. None of the items ever have prices on them because of this. If say you're from Russia or Germany and the like you'll get the big initial price, if you're from Serbia like me, you'll probably get a smile.<p>2. Let's say you are from Germany, and were looking at a shirt, he'll tell you 40.  You simply can't allow yourself to buy it at this price, neither is he expecting you to (although I'm sure that happens). At this point he just wants you to pile up the stuff you like from the store.<p>3. When you're done, he'll sit you down for ""the deal"". Now's the time to haggle, and you should have been thinking of ways to cut the price while you were picking up the clothes. He'll probably give you a small discount ""for bulk"" that you should dismiss at once, and aim for at least 30% off of everything (50% is standard somewhere, some parts is less), and don't be afraid to return some things you don't want to buy.<p>So yeah, if you want some schooling in direct sales, go to Turkey (Alanya is very nice) and go shopping.

4797680,comment,4795797,4796183,2,0,rymith,,,"Well, I think for starters, you're missing context for the first example.  Prior art must pertain to the context, and animated film is not a touch enabled computing device.  For instance, just because Roddenberry thought of the idea of teleportation doesn't mean this concept in the show is prior art.  If and when a company does invent a teleporter, then they will be able to patent it.<p>And your second point about obvious is flawed.  Everything is obvious when you know the correct answer.  For instance, a wheel is so obvious that a very young child could rationalize its creation and use.  Because it's obvious once seen.  But if it's so obvious, why did it take us 245,000 year or so to invent the wheel?  Microsoft has been touting the tablet for ten years.  Why didn't they create it, if it's so obvious.<p>I think all patents need to go away, I think they cripple innovation and make it impossible to create something new if you're not a giant corporation.  But in so long as we're stuck with these laws, then every company has to try to patent everything it can so it doesn't get sued.",1353143283

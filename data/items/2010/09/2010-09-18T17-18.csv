There you'd want the original compressed stream stored on the disk; if you grabbed from the HDMI stream you'd have to re-encode it and it'd be a lossy rip.<p>What it does impact is the possibility for hardware devices with unlicensed HDMI inputs. This is primarily useful for people with early HD TVs that didn't support HDCP (or didn't have HDMI/DVI at all), or an owner of an HD projector (many of which have no or bad HDCP implementations.) It would also theoretically be useful for creating a custom DAC or video processor.<p>Anyway, with Intel threatening to sue, this means only the Chinese will create HDCP strippers.

However, if you take one specific cancer from this group (chronic myelogenous leukemia of the Bcr/abl type), you can treat it with imatinib. The survival at 5 years with imatinib is 89%--an incredible success. I'm saying this to point out that we <i>already have</i> individualized treatments for (a vanishing minority of) cancers.<p>As we grow to understand the molecular and genetic basis for each individual cancer, we will, one by one, be able to target these and turn them into chronic diseases like hypertension or hypercholesterolemia. Perhaps, one day, we will even cure them. The current article being discussed actually hints at a more global phenomenon, and may produce tools that we can use <i>as add-ons to</i> the individualized cancer treatments that we will be giving patients.<p>I'll just repeat the two things that I always like to say in this type of discussion:<p>1: We need to target the molecular basis for disease.<p>2: We need to remember the HAART model when treating cancer, which involves targeting multiple enzymes necessary for tumor growth and proliferation (or at least target different parts of the same enzymes) in order to fight drug resistance.",1284832554

Are people who buy porn differently creditworthy than people who don't?  For example, maybe they have more money (more creditworthy), or poorer impulse control (less creditworthy), or less intelligence (makes it harder for them to pay but also harder to declare bankruptcy, dispute collections, etc.). Maybe there are other customers who would be interested in this data as well: health insurers, or auto insurers, or private investigators, or political or religious opponents. Or, obviously, competing porn merchants, who would love to have a list of leads who are already known to be willing to spend money on porn.<p>I have this vague memory of an article about how it turned out that people who bought ""responsible"" products like, I forget, in-wall house insulation or vinyl siding, were much more likely to pay their debts than people who spent money in strip clubs --- even when they were matched for income, age, and gender.

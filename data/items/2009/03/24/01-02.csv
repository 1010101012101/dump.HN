529565,comment,529227,529227,0,0,ggchappell,,,"There are some worthwhile ideas in this article, but I have a slightly different take on them.<p>The sentence near the end, ""Trust is the new competitive advantage."" is the main point. And he says small companies tend to have the advantage as far as trust goes. But, while that <i>is</i> generally true, it might be looked at as a challenge for large companies.<p>As I see it, large companies have two advantages: (1) they can take advantage of economies of scale, and (2) when they figure out how to do something <i>right</i>, they can apply their knowledge very widely.<p>For an example of #2, consider Joel Spolsky's statement about Big Macs: ""The secret of Big Macs is that they're not very good, but every one is not very good in exactly the same way."" If someone is in an unfamiliar area, other restaurants may offer the possibility of better food, but McDonald's has them beat on <i>trust</i>: when you go to McDonald's, you know exactly what you are going to get.<p>So, rather than say that trust being an advantage, means that small companies are going to win, we might say that, in order to be competitive in this economy, large companies need to figure out trust.<p>And, for better or worse, the ones that do figure it out, might very well beat the small companies hands down.",1237859540

529532,comment,529401,529408,0,0,neilc,,,"I think the obvious reason is that understanding <i>why</i> the API works as it does allows you to understand more about what your program is doing, and thus lets you write better software. For example, you can just think of malloc() as a magical ""give me a block of memory!"" API, which is perfectly sufficient for a novice who wants to write working programs. Alternatively, you can understand some (not all!) of the details behind virtual memory and how a typical heap allocator works. In the long run, that helps you write better software (e.g. by gaining an intuition for the relative costs of manual memory management, or debugging heap corruption).<p>So I think it's part of the difference between being a journeyman and an expert.

If that appears as a hard problem then I can only assume the author is looking at it at the wrong level of abstraction. In fact he is - he's judging it by what selenium can do.<p>If you take a step back from selenium for a moment and instead consider presenting the user with a meaningful visualization of all requests that happened during his sample-session, then this and similar problems suddenly become more of a challenge in UI design than anything else.<p>A few basic control-primitives in the UI to re-arrange the recorded script would go a long way here. Primitives such as ""Clone-this-request"", ""Clone-with-parameter-X-from-dict"", ""Simulate-Incremental-Search-By-Making-n-Substr-Clones"" etc. - you get the idea.<p>This whole ""edit my script""-step seems to be missing from browsermob, just like it is missing in most similar offerings.<p>Hence I have to ask: How would I go about modifying my recorded selenium script to login with random users?  To enter random data into forms?  To actually perform <i>random</i> incremental searches (to evade caching)? To enter <i>randomly chosen</i> data into forms (e.g. to post a message to a random but existing other user)?  To repeat requests first with random, then with chosen data (to hit form validation)? To <i>react</i> on special AJAX poll results or even server push via comet?  To have multiple concurrent sessions interact with each other?<p>These are the common challenges that I have faced during the construction of load-tests and in my expirience that is the time-consuming part. It seems with browsermob I'm down to editing selenium scripts by hand again?<p>Sorry if I come across as disrespectful but the lack of usable, on-demand load-testing solutions [that don't make you pay through the nose] has indeed nagged me for a while, too.<p>If there's one thing that I've learned during the implementation of such tests then it would be that bad testing is worse than no testing. Nothing easier than giving yourself a false sense of security.<p>The incremental search example you cited is actually a textbook example for how relying on purely recorded sessions will lead to a bad test. Playing back the same recorded search a zillion times is nowhere near a realistic workload, no matter how much you crank up the concurrency.",1237857375

I think it's a pretty sure bet here that fusion is going on somewhere in some fashion.<p>Now, what is not obvious is whether one could actually get any sort of useful energy out of this.  We already have tabletop neutron generators that classify as a form of ""cold fusion""--they just take a lot more energy in than they put out and there's no practical way to make them more efficient, as opposed to magnetic confinement fusion which does show promise for scaling up.<p>Of course, it all needs more research, which is why the way the topic has been poisoned by Pons/Fleischmann is really a problem.",1237857122

If someone adds a friend who I know, I probably won't notice now, whereas before I might've seen it and added that friend.  These kinds of things are valuable for social networking.<p>What kind of performance are you measuring, and why does it matter more than other kinds?",1237856600

It's the largest freshwater lake, near(ish) to the Russian border, and with ~24,000 cubic kilometers of water, it has 20% of the world's surface freshwater that's drinkable.",1237856505

Without bees, crops would still be pollinated by other insects, but not nearly in the amount needed to sustain current levels of production (and therefore human life).",1237856477

I figured that just because I couldn't think of a significant example off the top of my head, I wasn't thinking hard enough.<p>I am confused by their figures, though. ""If they were to be self-sufficient in food, they would need ten billion cubic metres of water per year. As it is, they have only about one-third of that: enough to grow 15-20% of their food."" Ten billion would grow 100%, but a third of the water grows no more than a fifth of the food? It shouldn't be that some of the current water supply goes to other uses; a couple of sentences later is a note that domestic and industrial uses should find rainfall alone to be enough.<p>How would tripling the amount of water available allow them to increase domestic food production by five or six times?",1237856426

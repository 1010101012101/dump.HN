Even if you tell the world that the message wasn't invalid, you don't reveal any new information to the attacker.<p>OTOH, if the receiver must decrypt before checking the MAC, any information leaked to the attacker (success or failure, timing, etc) is very likely to give the attacker a systematic method to decrypt some or all of your secret plaintext.",1352833194

Am I supposed to buy one physical machine per configuration that I want to test?<p>Apple <i>has</i> recently gotten a little friendlier in this regard. At least now you can run OS X in a virtual machine at all, even if it does have to be on Mac hardware.<p><i>Microsoft also has a history of private APIs.</i><p>Not really...and especially not on the level that Apple does. (Can you name some off the top of your head that are not security related?) It's not just about APIs either. It's usually an utter lack of functionality on Apple's part.<p>For example, look at Finder vs Explorer. Does Finder have an official/supported plug-in architecture yet? Why not? Power users and developers have been begging for this for over ten years.<p>What do you suppose Apple's reason is for only allowing the Dock program to affect NSScreen visibleFrame? I believe that it's the same reason that Apple took forever to allow people to resize Windows by all sides. It's the same reason that they never admitted that a single-button mouse is <i>not</i> better - they think they know better than any other developers out there. That's unfriendly.<p><i>Fortunately, you can use Java or any mixture of widely-used open source libraries, which are often far easier to compile and use, given that OS X is a fairly regular UNIX.</i><p>Apple is not very inviting to a large portion of developers, yet there's (sometimes) an alternative, so that means Apple is friendly to developers? I know that all of the *nix devs out there are on Macs now because Linux failed miserably as a desktop OS...but that still doesn't make Apple friendly to developers.<p>There's a reason that Apple has this bad reputation with developers, particularly in comparison with Microsoft. Part of it has to do with their business model, part of it is simply hubris and in any case, there's a long history to consult here.",1352833099

It seemed like a good idea at first: A public school system would be known for having ""higher standards"" than others. The problem? Colleges didn't give a damn what grading scale you used. Your GPA was the same as anyone's, which made it harder on every student without any real benefit.<p>My question is what does this ""achievement standard"" do if the grading system stays the same?

If we are, it's a warning sign we're wading into the dangerous world of actually <i>implementing</i> crypto. We're just supposed to <i>use</i> pre-built, peer-reviewed crypto systems and understand at a very high level how they work. E.g. knowing what a hash is versus symmetric keys vs asymmetric keys, knowing which algorithms are still acceptable (Bcrypt) and which aren't (md5). And this, I think, is the right message for developers.<p>But the OP has a valid point. If it's true that many of the high-level, crypto-layman-friendly libraries do bad things like using all-zero IVs, then we have a real problem. But here's where I disagree with the OP: It <i>should not fall on the average developer</i> to understand this stuff and override a crypto library's insecure defaults.<p>Instead, authors of crypto libraries need to step up and implement <i>secure defaults</i>, as well as provide <i>solid documentation</i> on the do's and don'ts of their libraries. (Assuming of course the OP is correct about the flawed defaults in existing libraries.)<p>In any case, the solution is not to urge normal developers to learn crypto at the level the OP describes. I'm a smart guy, but I know better than to trust myself with things like initialization vectors. This is, after all, what the broader crypto community has been telling people.",1352832813

4779726,comment,4779015,4779307,9,0,just2n,,,"You're interpreting these posts all wrong.  There are plenty of things within the field of CS that are sufficiently complex and difficult to get right that your average Joe Coder shouldn't be attempting to write them in production code.  There isn't some shroud of difficulty around crypto in particular.  For instance, in just about any project, getting ANY security right, not even considering crypto, is typically an overwhelming task.<p>The point is that when people read this blog on the front-page of HN, they expect to learn something.  99.99% of us aren't writing our own crypto.  But this is a way of learning.  I've been told from basically everyone in the industry since a young age that you shouldn't write your own crypto.  As a result, I educated myself to understand how I might get it wrong so I can understand when things are wrong, and so that I could understand crypto news.  Similarly, as a web dev, I educated myself heavily on common vulnerabilities.  The end result is that no, I can't say that everything I make is 100% secure, but it's certainly a lot better than if I didn't do those things.  At least now I can actually see when myself and others might be causing a vulnerability.<p>You seem to be hand-waving things and telling people ""STAY AWAY.""  Maybe, just maybe, instead of treating people like they're all idiots, enlightening them might work a little better.  You've put a warning on the label, the blog post is NOT a guide on how to make crypto, but a guide in how you'll probably get it wrong.  Now proceed with the juicy details.  Maybe I don't know why I shouldn't be using ECB because I don't know what it is because I don't do crypto.  Maybe I'm not implementing my own block cipher, or maybe I'm just curious about the different modes of block ciphers and which are good/bad and why.  Maybe with a better understanding I can even explain it to other people rather than just telling them ""you shouldn't do your own crypto,"" and look like an idiot when I have nothing to say when they ask ""why?""<p>Applying your reasoning to computer science -- some people end up as negative productive engineers.  They create more bugs and problems than they solve.  Obviously, we should just STOP TEACHING CS to anyone because such people exist, right?",1352832120

I agree that the 'sold out' buzz is a popular marketing technique, its one of the persuasion tools that works well, scarcity, but I think that is a side effect here.<p>So take a moment and imagine you are in the product manager's shoes at Google and you're tasked with forecasting how many Nexus 4's will be needed. If you guess 'high' you end up with HP's Touchpad fiasco, or Motorola's Xoom, too much product. Since you've probably borrowed the money to buy the parts to build the stuff and you have to pay it in 90 days, you need to get stuff, sell it, and then get the money to pay off the money you borrowed.<p>Building a million phones like this probably costs in the neighborhood of $200M - $250M. That is a pretty sizable chunk of cash to be hanging out there 'in the float' as it were. Sloshing around that much capital is like driving a fully loaded big rig truck on a wet highway, you don't want to enter any turn with too much speed, the 'bad' outcome is really bad.<p>So of the two options, ""leaving money on the table"" because someone who wanted to buy your gear couldn't, and ""missing your wall street guidance"" because you're carrying inventory for longer than you wanted, the former is the much better choice. At the limit its horrible but if you're going to err, and your error bars are large, you want to err on the negative side not the positive side. On the negative side you just don't make as much money as you might have wanted to, on the positive side you don't make the margins you need to make on the product.",1352831490

Memory Management - Java takes care of it all for you, whereas in C++ you have to manually allocate and de-allocate memory, otherwise you will have memory leaks.<p>2. Learn the Standard Template Library (STL). C++ has a much smaller library of pre-built code that Java. The STL is very good for some basic data structures like map, set, etc.<p>3. Pointers - Java has references, C++ has pointers. You need to learn how to use them safely.<p>4. Polymorphism - Similar to Java but syntax is a bit different<p>5. Operator Overloading - You can redefine operators such as ""+"" or ""-"" to make your code look cleaner.  This can be dangerous, but very useful if done correctly.<p>I think that is a good start. Overall the transition to C++ should be relatively easy once you master memory management and pointers.",1352831078

The Consumer Price Index is how we Americans typically measure ""inflation"" which measures the change in retail prices of a ""market basket"" of goods from period to period.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics goes to great lengths to determine this market basket.  You are essentially saying that the BLS is favoring a higher income basket over a lower income basket and if they focused on the latter, CPI would report much higher inflation.  I don't think this is true.  CPI is far from perfect, especially if you introduce Austrian definitions of inflation, but I think they do a good, consistent job.

A $50K household will have $10K left over and a $100K household will have $60K left over.  If prices increase by 5% on the $40K, that's now $42K.

That will help people respond to your question.<p>I'll tell you what I tell everyone looking for a new phone. Go play with them. Honestly, that is the best way to find the phone that you want considering most of the specs are similar unless you are a power user (ie, flashing new roms, rooting etc). Put the phone in your pocket, sit down, walk around with it etc and make sure it fits your daily life. This is specfically true for the Note 2 which is f'in huge. For me, it's size wasn't a huge deal and I returned my s3 for a note 2 last night. The note 2 is f'in awesome, but it may not be useful to you.<p>In response:\nS3: awesome phone, nice features, a few apps you can't delete (I had the AT&T version, YMMV) but overall a very nice feel. I really liked that phone and although it was large (4.7"" screen), it was light and easy to use.<p>Note 2: LARGE. 5.5"" screen..which is too big for most people. It also has a stylus (pen) that you can use to write on it and I really like that feature. however, if you have no use for that feature, don't bother.<p>Nexus 4: I haven't used this yet so I can't say much. what I can say is that it looks pretty bad ass and I'd highly consider it IF it had LTE connectivity. \nI live in NYC so LTE is all over the place and the difference between that and 3g is pretty significant. This, however, only matters if you have access to LTE networks.<p>Overall, I think you can't go wrong with any of the choices you are going to make. \nIf you live in the states, and you are on contract, the S3 is going on sale at BestBuy for $50 on Black friday (2 yr contract required). If money is an issue, I'd almost think that is a no brainer.<p>To be short, just go play with the phone and see which one you like best. Everyone has an opinion, everyone has their own interests in mind, so the only way to really make the right decision is to just interact with the phone yourself. You aren't going to pick the wrong phone, all 3 of the phones you are interested in are pretty damn awesome:)<p>Oh and lastly, Youtube!

So their snapshots should already be very efficient.<p>VMware virtual disks are copy-on-write disks. When you open a VM and start writing to the virtual disk, it creates a new .vmdk (virtual disk) file and writes the changes to that file. (Persistent disks are an exception; changes are written directly to the original .vmdk file.)<p>When you take a snapshot, it simply freezes the current .vmdk file(s) and starts writing to a new one. It's very quick and efficient. Restoring a snapshot is equally quick and efficient: VMware simply goes back to the .vmdk(s) that make up that snapshot, opens a new scratch .vmdk for further disk writes, and you're ready to go.<p>You can go back to an old snapshot, make some changes, and save this as a new snapshot. Then you end up with a tree of snapshots, each one using only the disk space needed for the changes that went into that virtual disk.<p>Of course, even though these delta disks are fairly space-efficient, it still adds up when you use a lot of snapshots!<p>One trick I use when I create a Linux VM is to create three separate virtual disks for it: a normal .vmdk with snapshot capability for most of the filesystem, plus two smaller nonpersistent .vmdk's for swap and /tmp. I start those two .vmdk's as persistent disks (no snapshot, changes are written directly into the original .vmdk) and then switch them to nonpersistent mode immediately after creating the disks. Nonpersistent disks write their changes to a temporary delta .vmdk when is discarded when the VM is powered down, so writes to /tmp and swap do not go into the snapshots.<p>I should do this with my Windows VMs too - putting the temp directory and swapfile on nonpersistent disks would help cut down the size of the Windows snapshots.",1352829835

The truth is that now I have no idea.<p>Crypto is hard, but it's so important today that it shouldn't be presented in such an obtuse way.  There should be <i>one resource</i> that in big, bold headings and simple sentences outlines the best available crypto methods for each particular use case.  Hashing password? Bcrypt.  Asymmetrically encrypting plaintext?  Algo XXX.  Etc.  Bonus points for step-by-step instructions on how to use those methods in common programs like GPG.<p>Without a human-readable, trusted, official resource, it's just going to be crypto scientists shoving acronyms down our throats till we don't care any more.  <i>Please</i> simplify it and eliminate the bad choices for us, because you know better!

In general that would be a question only from the perspective of dualism, but I don't think this is the case with the Tolkien's view on his world. The world <i>appears</i> predominantly evil, but in essence Tolkien maintains the view of the ultimate good (i.e. hidden), as an intention of Eru. So tipping the balance into the good side usually doesn't disrupt it as much. However extreme shifts still can have serious consequences.

Change the debate. Present irrational and disproportionate ""tough on crime"" rhetoric with strong public opposition and make sure the demagogues fighting progress have to face the scorn and ridicule they deserve.<p>>There are certainly attempts (mostly at the state level) to downgrade victimless or harmless crimes, and to divert petty or juvenile criminals into non-penal programs or extrajudicial fora.<p>Which is well and good, though I think most of the problem lies at the federal level, so it would be nice to see more progress there.<p>>However, this is slow going; there are conflicting theories on the role of criminal law (consequentialist, deontological and so on) and no clear answer on the purpose of sanctions (deterrent, penal, and rehabilitative) that don't yield to simple analysis.<p>I think the key to this is to realize that the existing system doesn't adequately serve <i>any</i> of those goals. Consequentialists should be dissatisfied by the number of victimless crimes being prosecuted. Deontologically there are a great many ""criminals"" going unpunished because they violated the letter but not the spirit of the law, while those who violate the spirit but not the letter (or otherwise raise the ire of a prosecutor) are often prosecuted on the basis of ""he seems like a bad guy, let's find something we can nail him with."" Anyone interested in deterrence or rehabilitation can't be satisfied with the recidivism rate, and anyone interested in punishment (as distinguished from revenge) should be extremely concerned about the lack of proportionality.<p>Moreover, solutions that work in practice tend to satisfy everybody. Nobody who isn't being intentionally disingenuous is going to be dissatisfied by a reduction in the crime rate or the recidivism rate.<p>>Changing this will take a generation, or two.<p>Possibly.

The meme is hatched: SimCity 2013 has a highly brittle dependency on poorly-planned cloud infrastructure.<p>There's a private region mode in the game (that you nonetheless can't use offline in the current architecture). EA needs to have Maxis crunch for the next couple of weeks to make this work offline. Yes, I've read the nebulous quotes about ""part of the sim happening in the cloud."" Whatever that is, they'll have to move it to the client.<p>Once offline play is possible, if EA wants any chance to make back its investment on this game, they're going to have to first promote the new offline mode, and then spend the next couple of months doing some post-launch rescoping of the multiplayer aspect. They can still make it work; it could still be fantastic  but they have to move fast.",1362689389

It also implements a couple of other interfaces, but at its core, it's what you describe.<p>Functionally, they're basically the same thing - it's only a syntactic difference whether you check whether a pointer is nil vs. checking whether a boolean is false. At <i>some</i> point, you either have to do a check <i>or</i> coerce a null value into a reasonable value. (Or, I guess, just risk it!).<p>Functional programming purists may cringe at the analogy, but this is is all more or less the same functionality as Scala's 'Option' monad - it just depends on how you want to express it. The only difference is that the Go compiler doesn't force you to check against nil before dereferencing, but if you want to ensure the safety before converting the database value to a String and forgetting about it, then the struct will do that.",1362687094

I never asked for references or kept a portfolio of my past work.<p>To get that first client:<p>1. Advertise and be picky about where. There are lists of freelancers who are specialized in certain kinds of work. Put yourself on them. You will get desperate people who can't find anyone to take on their job. Some of these jobs will be pretty bad. DO NOT take them, even as a way to build your portfolio. I learned this the hard way. You may think you are superhuman, but burnout is your enemy. Forget oDesk or similar. For example, if you know Django, put yourself into Django people. I got lots of clients that way when I first started out.<p>2. Use your connections, and build more connections. While I would never sell to friends and family, you can find clients through them. When I was a teenager I started a successful custom PC business this way. You never know who your acquaintances might know and what problems they might have that you can solve.<p>3. Deny everything. Do not act like you are new. You have to have confidence in being enough of an expert to do the job for anyone to take you seriously. Be the kind of person who doesn't need to give references to get a client. References have only rarely come up for me because I would always demonstrate a firm grasp of what the problem that needed to be solved was and I could offer a careful plan of attack.<p>4. Sell yourself. I don't mean by blogging or having a website. When you talk to client over the phone or meet them in person, you need to sell yourself as a competent worker. If you've worked on projects that have something to do with the project a client is proposing, say so. You don't need to add qualifiers about it being a hobby project or open source contribution. If you can solve your client's problem your job is to make sure you make them believe that you're the person to do it. Everything else is just details.<p>5. Avoid LinkedIn. This was easier when I started...it might be harder now. Connecting with potential clients on LinkedIn could expose you as inexperienced (or help if you have lots of corporate experience). Take on small enough projects to start that this doesn't come up. This almost always means your first clients will be small businesses.<p>6. Repeat to yourself before meeting with a client: ""This person will judge me based on our interaction. They will only know my experience level based on this. I am only inexperienced if I lead them to believe it.""",1362686561

Just started working on it recently. I feel actually smarter today than I felt back then, so I don't think will hurt that much.<p>""The good thing is that most of the book requires only calculus and linear algebra. By brushing up on those topics first, you could be in a position to understand most of the basics of machine learning.""<p>Yeah, I've noticed. The scope of the whole book is <i>vastly</i> overblown for my needs, my application (NLP-related) won't probably need more then the basic stuff, but any good material at my disposal helps.",1362686478

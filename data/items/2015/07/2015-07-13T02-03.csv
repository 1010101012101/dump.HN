The company I used to work for, at the time I left, was dealing with some particularly spiteful individuals from S.Korea who have been DDoSing their gaming platform and their separate video host. This was happening off and on for about 12 months. Interestingly enough, each attack was committed by completely different individual and were unrelated. In one attack where the guy was caught (I think they caught all but 2 of the attackers), he claimed he ran the DDoS because he didn&#x27;t like the fact that there was a Japanese pop music video being hosted on the video site. This wasn&#x27;t a young kid either, the guy was 33 and had a full time job at some advertising company.",1436756376

Friday is the worst, that being said get it over ASAP and give them as much warning as possible to give them time to land on their feet. I agree with Steven cut more than you have to, a second round of layoffs means you loose everybody you would want to keep. I have never seen a company survive if it has went to that well twice.<p>Chances are they already know it is coming, if work is slow and not coming in or the burn rate is high and you have run long on funds then they will be expecting it. Have a very clear plan to explain to those that stay, as to why the ship is righted now and how you plan to survive. Plan to loose at least a few of your best guys, if you loose one, use his/her salary to give the others a raise or you will lose them too.<p>Also cut the pessimist over the pragmatist or the optimist. In a layoff environment the pessimist will kill your company moral. If you got a guy that is say 15% better than another guy but he is a pessimist and the other guy is an optimist, keep the optimist. That being said, trim dead weight if they are just not skilled let them go not matter their outlook. As others have said, look to trim, trim more than you need.",1436756324

9876114,comment,9876009,9876009,0,0,JacobAldridge,,,"I&#x27;ve had to let people go directly, and helped others through this process. It sucks, and it&#x27;s an immensely valuable lesson as an entrepreneur - when you&#x27;ve done this once, you will work harder to prevent it ever happening again, while at the same time being prepared to do it faster in situations where that is warranted.<p>A common mistake when winding back a company is <i>only</i> pulling it back to break-even. Eg, &#x27;Our revenue forecasts show we can cover 50 salaries, so let&#x27;s cut back to 50 people.&#x27; There are two problems with this - first, if your forecasts are too optimistic, you will be forced to do another round of cuts and the team / clients will start fearing a death spiral. Second, cutting a business back to break even leaves you with no spare cash flow to invest in future growth - you risk stagnating. Better to add an extra 10% to the layoffs now than risk the remainder of the business.<p>From there, the decision about who to let go is sometimes obvious (you might be dropping a product line, have an underperforming team, or some stand-out low performers). Do what you can to re-deploy your top performers elsewhere within the company - you&#x27;ll want them, and their advocacy, moving forward. Where it&#x27;s not obvious, and you can&#x27;t get guidance from team leaders etc, accept that it&#x27;s going to be partly a crapshoot where nobody wins.<p>How you communicate the decision and the reason why is critical. steven2012 has covered this well elsewhere in the thread. Be honest, take responsibility, and be positive for the future you plan to create. Good luck.",1436756105

9876081,comment,9874521,9876021,0,0,lpolovets,,,"I&#x27;m an early stage VC, so I often invest at the same time as angel investors. I think there are shortcuts to getting an investment even if you are approaching a new market. Sometimes that means showing enough promise with an MVP (which often doesn&#x27;t require much capital). Sometimes it&#x27;s having an amazing team -- for example, a lot of early PayPal folks could probably raise money with just about any reasonable-sounding idea.<p>Also, investors typically invest in areas that they&#x27;re familiar with, but that can be a pretty inclusive criterion. For example, I&#x27;ve personally worked on payment fraud detection before (as an engineer), so that makes me feel comfortable investing in fraud detection, but also credit assessment (similar algorithms), a large number of startups that involve lending or payments, and so on. For another example, my fund invested in Flexport (a recent YC company that handles shipping logistics for companies). My partners and I didn&#x27;t have any personal logistics experience, BUT one of my partners worked at a company that struggled with imports and shipping, so he appreciated the pain point. Also, Flexport&#x27;s CEO, Ryan, is a force of nature and had been working in the import/export space for 15 years, so he was very credible. That was enough for us to invest despite not having logistics experiences ourselves.<p>In the Airbnb example -- and I wasn&#x27;t an investor 6 years ago so I don&#x27;t know what their pitch was like -- I&#x27;m guessing if the founders had a bunch of lodging-related experience, or if they had previously built great companies, or if they had a few more data points that showed the viability of their model, that could&#x27;ve helped.<p>Finally, here&#x27;s the challenge from an investor&#x27;s point of view: you see 1500 pitches per year. The majority of the pitches mention something like &quot;we&#x27;re going to be a billion dollar company&quot; or &quot;we&#x27;re going to create an entire new market.&quot; One or two of those 1500 companies will do just that, ten or twenty companies will get kind of close, and the other 99% won&#x27;t be close at all. In hindsight, it&#x27;s easy to look at Airbnb or Uber and think that investors were short-sighted. Maybe they were. But a lot of early stage companies look simultaneously promising and risky in their early days, and most of them fail, so investors understandable err on the side of pessimism.",1436755303

I survived them, but it was a terrible experience, and after a while, people stopped working and just gossiped about the next layoff.<p>First off, if you&#x27;re going to do layoffs, make sure it&#x27;s one and done.  This means, probably cutting more than you have to so that you don&#x27;t have to keep making layoffs in 6 months, etc.  The quicker you can get back to hiring, the better it will be for morale.<p>Layoff your lowest performers first.  If you don&#x27;t, then your top performers will leave you, and you will get crippled within less than a year.  Don&#x27;t do something like ask everyone to take a paycut, because it means that your top performers suffer just as much as your low performers.  You should get rid of your low performers quickly.<p>Try to give as generous a severance package that you can.  And meet with each of them face-to-face if possible, but with several dozen it&#x27;s probably impossible.<p>Make it quick and let them leave with dignity.  That means let them say bye to their friends, and making sure that every single question they may have answered.  COBRA, unvested options, Unemployment benefits, etc.  Personally I wouldn&#x27;t escort them out or lock their accounts unless you think that they are going to cause problems.  Hopefully they won&#x27;t.<p>Do all the layoffs before lunch.

What marked the turning point for me was discovering cognitive therapy[0]. It showed me that the way I talked to myself about what happened was the root cause of my depression. I&#x27;m a born pessimist. It took several years of intense effort to implement this technique in my own life, but thankfully it&#x27;s allowed me to achieve serenity.<p>One addition I made to the CT techniques was visualizing my emotions as having distinct personalities –– Anger, Sadness, etc. I got this idea after watching the recent Pixar movie. It&#x27;s silly but it really helps to picture your emotions as people who have their own agendas and are trying to manipulate you into carrying them out because then your depression becomes a people management problem. Consider the difference: 1) how can I manage Anger, Sadness or Fear so they don&#x27;t drive me nuts? 2) how can I cure my depression? The first one is actionable, and the second one is not.<p>Despite having good results with CT, I&#x27;m convinced there is no magic cure to depression. You only manage it all your life. But that&#x27;s a good thing because it means depression management is a skill you can cultivate, and that gives me hope.<p>---------------------------------<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/depression/features/cognitive-therapy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webmd.com/depression/features/cognitive-therapy</a>",1436754312

Remember those? I couldn&#x27;t understand those rules at the time but i do now, they were there to prevent situations like what&#x27;s happening now with Greece!

And then there&#x27;s the persistent doubts about whether the beta-amyloid hypothesis is correct in the first place...<p>> Swart, who is also a leadership coach, has been instructing executives to sleep for years. She promotes techniques related to diet and exercise, and warns that sleeping next to your smartphone—the one that emits 3G and 4G signals all night—affects your brain patterns, restructuring your brain cells and likely preventing you from allowing your brain to clean out waste material properly.<p>> Research published in 2007 has already found that the electrical radiation emitted from smart devices is picked up by electrodes inside our brains. Scientists are still trying to figure out just how much damage the electromagnetic signals emitted from WiFi equipment can actually do to the human brain. But by potentially preventing our brains from flushing beta-amyloid—just by being in close proximity—it’s clear these devices already have the potential for serious damage.<p>Or as Lehrer&#x27;s writeup says:<p>> Although this research shows that cell phone transmissions can affect a person&#x27;s brainwaves with persistent effects on behavior, Horne does not feel there is any need for concern that cell phones are damaging. The arousal effects the researchers measured are equivalent to about half a cup of coffee, and many other factors in a person&#x27;s surroundings will affect a night&#x27;s sleep as much or more than cell phone transmissions.",1436753236

The years are progressively better (from my perspective) as you get more clinical and hands-on, and further away from rote memorization of biochemical pathways and arcane minutiae that have only the obscurest connections to actual patient care. As a first-year resident in emergency medicine in the Bay Area, I am very happy I went to medical school - I am sure that throughout my training and career I&#x27;ll have ups and downs, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like I wasted my time, especially as I am starting practicing as a physician. Every so often, those obscure pieces of trivia that I memorized do come up (in EM especially, you get to see all sorts of things, and sometimes it&#x27;s fun recognizing the weird findings of autoimmune disease or dermatological things, even if you&#x27;re not going to order the assays to definitively diagnose them in the department).<p>Living out here in SF it&#x27;s interesting to compare my past and current life to the friends I have who are involved in tech. I think similarities are the often-seen lack of work/life balance (something I think I developed over three years of working before entering medical school and I would encourage any new MS1 to prioritize thinking about), and the sometimes-overwhelming feelings of &quot;imposter syndrome&quot; or constantly feeling like you somehow fooled people into getting where you are, or that you don&#x27;t know the things other people think you know. There&#x27;s also a lot of love for the latest and greatest in technology or theoretical frameworks for understanding disease, sometimes at the expense of things that have been used for ages and that work quite effectively (tincture of time and observation for almost anything, ice for pain, physical exam for evaluation of hemodynamic status).<p>Tips for incoming first year -- if you&#x27;re tech-savvy, or at least can touch-type, consider checking out Anki, and reading others&#x27; tips for utilizing spaced repetition in your studying. Focus on backwards planning your own curricula, using released tests or your professors&#x27; advice to get an idea of what will be tested material. Get, and do, as many questions as possible -- BRS, UWorld, NBMEs, etc. Make flashcards from the questions you get wrong.

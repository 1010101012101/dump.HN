Those are normal people.  The 30% that do attend college and finish with at least a Bachelor's are the minority.<p>Yes, school is a social environment for learning, that has value, but it's hardly the only way to obtain that.  Outside of school, there are local clubs and hobbie groups, forums and blogs such as this on the Internet, alternate paths such as the military, etc.  There are all kinds of ways to be around people who enjoy the same things you do, or are trying to learn the same things you are without going to school.<p>By saying thats a benefit of school you're implying that it's not obtainable elsewhere.  School just isn't that important if you really <i>want</i> to learn, it's more valuable for those that lack motivation and need someone to <i>make</i> them learn.",1211655599

In the UK there's a 5 year gap between finishing secondary school, and finishing university (2 years of college in between).<p>During that 5 years, I've lived in 3 completely different locations within England, and lived in another country for a few years too. I've worked for big companies, small companies, startup companies and now myself.<p>It was a personal decision, that I took, and I don't regret it one bit. I'm not even in the market to get a job, I just had an old annoyance come back when I noticed a few startups requiring degree's for their jobs on here, I thought startups would be different to the usual useless HR departments in that they should be able to tell good developers to bad, without filtering on whether they have a degree or not..",1211655351

You don't learn much from your peers at a typical cooking class, but they still contribute to why many people choose to take classes rather than self-study.",1211655009

Some people could still use Twitter or whatever, just as people still use wordpress.com or blogspot.com.<p>To me it certainly seems desirable to do so, but scaling problems would probably still apply, if servers would poll each other at will.<p>Another problem would be the free SMS that Twitter ""donates"".

The discussions these open up will tell you a lot about their knowledge of making flexible software.<p>Again, the test is just to weed out the bad candidates and allow you to only interview worthy people, everything else you'll find out in the actual interview.

Lisp puts the operator on the far left, and has no penalty for a newline, so I find it much easier to keep lines shorter.<p>In Algol-based languages, I end up with ""something_something [op] something_something"" and then if I need to do something else, my next line <i>starts</i> 20 chars from the left edge, to line up with the op.

If you don't know them, then I will feel that you lack common sense.<p>""In our CS degree, we saw a lot of proofs, and had to work through many of them by hand. I feel that this was to some extent unnecessary, since it obscured the importance of the things we were proving by putting us all to sleep. Being able to prove something does allow you to reason through it to assure yourself of its correctness, and to derive it from first principles if you've forgotten it. But in everyday programming, you don't need to do proofs. You ought to have a feel for the outline of the proof, the sort of intuitive derivation of a rule, so you can reason through it with yourself and with others. But you don't need to be ultra-formal about it unless you happen to love proofs, as some folks do.<p>""Instead, you need to be aware of the major findings and learnings of Computer Science, and the rough reasons for them. I realize this opinion is going to displease two audiences: CS theory folks, who will think it's too weak, and professional programmers with no CS degree, who will think it's too strong. But it's my opinion and I'll stick with it.""",1211653857

You shouldn't waste time talking to any programmer not willing to submit to some simplistic programming test in lieu of a resume.  Resumes are crap and have no place in hiring programmers.  Code is all that matters, either they can do it or they can't and if they can, they'll accept your challenge.<p>Nothing makes for a better interview than doing a code review and critique of the candidates own code.  Something simple but telling like write a little slot machine that lets you bet money, spin the wheel, and win or lose with the game ending when you run out of money.<p>Anyone who refuses such a test isn't a programmer you want anyway, and you can tell an enormous amount about a potential candidate by simply looking at the quality of the code submitted.  Don't bother interviewing anyone who's code you can't stand.  You can see everything you need to know about their skills in that code.<p>You wouldn't hire a graphic designer who refused to submit samples of his designs, nor should you hire a programmer who refuses to submit samples of his code.

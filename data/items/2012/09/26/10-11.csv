4574998,comment,4574943,4574943,12,0,freejack,,,"RIM is spending a lot of time designing an OS that will appeal to everyone. I think they are going to find its going to be used by no one.<p>Even here in Canada they are losing core enterprise customers left and right. Without these core supporters, RIM isn't long for this world.<p>And while I've got the conch, what kind of strategy is ""We want to be #3""? I've written about RIM's bad strategy extensively on my blog, and this feels like just another in a series of mis-steps. None of their staff are going to be inspired by Thorsten's lack of conviction and worse, its going to spook whatever remaining customers and developers they have. No one wants to be on a sinking platform, and shooting for number 3 isn't going to give anyone any confidence that RIM will be around in a year.<p>My vote still goes to RIM getting out of the OS business, becoming an Android licensee, designing some killer handsets that focus on enterprise customers and separately, spinning Blackberry Mail and Messenger into standalone apps that put RIM onto as many handsets as possible.<p>This will never happen of course. RIM, as I understand it, is still organized around carrier sales. They don't have a user focus, and it would be hard for this leopard to change its spots and get out of the business of catering to carriers. (IMO, this is the real magic of the Apple story - getting a user-centric handset into the market in a real way without pandering to the carriers.)",1348656993

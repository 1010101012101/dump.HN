They rarely mentioned Linux in their direct mail catalogs. Only recently when they switched from SUSE to Ubuntu have they increased the visibility of their Linux offerings. It's slowly gaining momentum there. I look forward to the day when they start advertising that they sell Linux on their TV ads.",1232110762

436532,comment,434839,436420,0,0,rbanffy,,,"Most probably, a big chunk of the oxygen in the atmosphere comes from last month's photosynthesis - we use it to make CO2 and green stuff converts it back, so, it's always brand-new oxygen we see. But free oxygen indicates a far more active biosphere than lots of methane would and I get your point - methane makers are much lower profile than oxygen makers.<p>As for Titan being covered with life... We really don't know if the lakes we see from space aren't giant amoebas waiting patiently to eat any humans that land on their beaches and just cleverly pretending to be lakes. ;-)",1232110038

I am not sure what people use for screencast softwares, but the Railscasts guys seem to be creating some neat looking ones. You might want to ask them.\nI know the LearningRails.com guys personally, and they do a great screencast too. There is a free HYperCam for Windows, but result is not all that impressive.

436526,story,,,1,2,satyajit,"Ask HN: Any service out there for titles/phrases/names/etc.",,"Writing a small helper class to suggest/auto-complete a text field with some commonly used names, titles, phrases etc. Helps to avoid misspellings, as well as not having to remember the entire title or what you have.\nFor example, not many of you can write Arnold Sc....gger's name without misspelling - so in that case I would like to suggest.\nSo I simply connected Google's auto-suggest to my textbox. But that's not a gr8 solution, as typing 'Arnold' gives me lot of useless junk such as ""arnold schwarzenegger soundboard"" and ""arnold schwarzenegger movies"" - because that's often searched upon.\nNow, Wiki is a good solution - they have got indexes too, and a great one, exactly the kind I am looking for. But they are alphabetically sorted, not by popularity. So even typing 'Arnold Sc' also doesn't get anywhere close to the answer.<p>Anyone has any other recommendation?",1232109503

436517,comment,436475,436500,0,0,cperciva,,,"In most cases it makes sense to pick the supervisor and then go wherever he is, rather than picking the university.  I've heard people say that the relationship a student has with his supervisor is the second most important one in his life, after the relationship he has with his spouse; I've also heard people dispute this and argue that the supervisor is more important.<p>Of course, in order to be in a position to pick a good supervisor, you need to make yourself attractive.  Do research; publish papers; go to conferences and present your work there; talk to other people in your field.  Faculty are always looking for more good graduate students, and meeting them at conferences will give you a chance to figure out if you get on well with them at a personal level.<p>That said, I did almost none of the above -- but I was a special case, in that I didn't particularly need any supervision (I'm pretty certain that I literally <i>saw</i> my supervisor less than two dozen times while I was a graduate student, and interacted far fewer times than that).",1232108901

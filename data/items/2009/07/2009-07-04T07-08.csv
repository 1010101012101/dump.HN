687005,comment,685721,686931,0,0,antirez,,,"This is exactly the problem. In every reference counting system you need to know if a function will incrRefCount or not the passed argument, if you need to increment it instead before to pass a new object, and things like this. One can try to have conventions but actually it is needed to know the behavior of other code in order to know if objects are reused, if one must pass objects that will be retained, if the object is expected to be already ""safe"" and will simply used and removed without to retain/release the reference.<p>For instance if you try to write a C extension for Python or Tcl or other systems using reference counting you'll notice that if you don't know every well the internals it can be not obvious when to increment or not the refcount.<p>I use refcount myself in Redis, and again for people not used to Redis internals to implement a new command may not be trivial exactly for this problem of reference counting. Reference counting is not something to expose for a language that aims to be a such an higher level. In short every language with complex OOP system should have some kind of automatic memory management IMHO.",1246694097

687001,comment,685603,686596,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Exactly. It seems that a knee jerk reaction ('flag') is more in line with expectations than any kind of moderate reaction to sense whether or not this kind of article belongs here. As I said it was an interesting read, which nuanced my viewpoint.<p>The bury brigade seems to be more than content to punish any kind of 'non adherence to the rules'. That makes it simple for me, next time I'll flag, interesting read or not.<p>A well thought out response to some question that gets relatively little traction here will gain you one or two points, but a 'faux pas' in a popular article that doesn't really belong here will get you -10 in total.",1246693480

686999,comment,686853,686946,0,0,gabriel,,,"I've always loved the Perl idea of ""If you want to treat everything as objects in Perl 6, Perl will help you do that. If you don't want to treat everything as objects, Perl will help you with that viewpoint as well."" (from <a href=""http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/docs/Perl6/Spec/S01-overview.pod"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/docs/Perl6/Spec/S01-overview.po...</a>).<p>From a traditional OS level this isn't very useful because it's your job to implement the lowest-level capability of storing data. But what if you're already running inside of an OS that provides all of that stuff for you. Then you are free to implement all sorts of crazy abstractions that can directly apply to even greater problems, like network transparency and distributed objects.<p>Now think of this as PG has with Arc (<a href=""http://paulgraham.com/core.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/core.html</a>) by creating basic axioms for an object interface given the pre-existing facilities of working inside a traditional OS. Something that could run a desktop to running on the cloud and you have some intriguing problems to work on that cannot be addressed by current OSes.<p>I think there's a lesson to be learned from current database trends. It seems that no one is expecting a database to automatically achieve scalability anymore, so now we have all of those projects that provide a distributed interface to a run-of-the-mill RDBMS (I'm thinking of Amazon's Dynamo work).<p>So, yeah, throw out the file concept, and everything else that has a chapter title in your OS text book. Then you'll be able to find ways of working in new OS/language concepts and quickly arrive at great problems like the current concurrency terror and cloud computing.",1246693166
686998,comment,686116,686981,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"> <i>Sorry, but a filesystem that doesn't preserve exactly what I put into it is broken.</i><p>I work with non-hackers, non-computer people who use computers as tools.  They are constantly surprised that Linux <i>does</i> make a distinction between cases.  They remember the words they used as the names of documents, letters, reports, etc., and they don't want to have to remember whether it was capitalised or not.<p>Dictating names of documents becomes a chore when you have to specify the capitalisation.  Just the other day my wife was trying to find a submission of mine here on HN and ended up phoning me in frustration, exactly because the system remembers/keeps exactly what was put into it.<p>Your attitude, quite rightly here for a hacker, is that you want the system to do exactly what you want.  For entrepreneurs and others who deal with non-hackers, knowing that most of the world don't see things the same way, and occasionally want something ""obviously wrong,"" is important.<p>(edited for typos)",1246693118

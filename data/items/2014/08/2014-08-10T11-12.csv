Which is probably close enough to OPs claim.  Or for a positive perspective 205.601 &quot;Synthetic substances allowed for use in organic crop production&quot; section (e) &quot;As insecticides (including acaricides or mite control)&quot; and that lists 10 allowable bug killers none of which seem to be neonicotinoids.<p>By negative and positive I don&#x27;t mean some electrical thing but words like &quot;can if you want&quot; vs &quot;no you will not&quot;.  Either way (edited:  Both ways...) no nicotinoids on USDA labeled produce in the USA.<p>State regs are only allowed to be stricter than fed.

There&#x27;s like 50 layers of middlemen and shippers in the food industry, you have a personal relationship with none of them (I buy beef from a family friend and bought vegetables from a great uncle who retired into being a gentleman farmer, that&#x27;s &quot;different&quot; than driving to a local food store), and all of them have a huge financial interest in taking visually identical apples from &quot;Chemical McWasteland&#x27;s Industrial Farm&quot; and putting them in boxes from &quot;Sunshine Unicorn Organic Farm&quot;.  How many layers of middlemen would make about a buck a pound or more by merely accidentally selling non-organic food as organic?  And how corrupt is this country?  In practice the primary effect of buying and eating organic produce is almost certainly feeling better while making corrupt individuals wealthier, even if theoretically health benefits could be available from organic produce.<p>So the TLDR is legally wrong in the USA at the fed level both by being specifically forbidden AND by not listed as permitted, yet is also probably right that if you buy an &quot;organic&quot; apple at a convenience store, it probably isn&#x27;t due to corruption.",1407671024

But I&#x27;d assume that with the right kind of regulations it can be controlled. E.g., require prostitutes to register. Registering should include a short course about basic rights and hygiene. They should have to go to regular health checks (maybe once a week), which should also provide access to social and legal counselling. The brothels should be required to keep track of anyone who works there and make sure that anyone working there has done those checks. This should be _regularly_ checked by the authority. Violations should be harshly punished.<p>Of course there is a risk if you over regulate it that there will still be black market prostitution happening.

He got into his truck and drove two-and-a-half hours to the nearest Home Depot to buy a mirror. He tried it right there in the parking lot, and in five minutes the pain was gone.</i><p>><i>Stephen used the mirror for two weeks, then stopped because the pain had not returned. About a year and a half later, he felt the pain again, and this time he stayed the course for the full five weeks. He hasn’t had phantom pain for over four years. “It’s gone now,” he says. “It’s gone because I treated myself with a mirror.”</i><p>The patient arranges a mirror to show a healthy limb as if it were the phantom.

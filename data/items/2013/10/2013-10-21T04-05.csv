6583398,comment,6581511,6582732,7,0,burntsushi,,,"It&#x27;s been hashed out over and over again on the mailing list. Their stance boils down to language design cohesion. In particular, avoiding null in your type system while preserving orthogonality in your language design would require a <i>completely different language</i> than the on that Go embodies. (This is in stark contrast with say, the Haskell community, which will add any new feature produced by original research.)<p>If you dig through the mailing list posts, avoiding null in the type system can be difficult to reconcile with &quot;zero values&quot;, which each type has. More subtlety, avoiding null in your type system might require adding support for sum types, which conflicts in weird ways with Go&#x27;s interfaces.<p>I think a lot of people tend to assume that null should <i>always</i> be eliminated from type systems because doing so can be done for free. But I disagree that it can be done for free, and my evidence is in the aforementioned mailing list posts.<p>The other reason why I suspect we&#x27;ll never see the elimination of null in Go&#x27;s type system is that it <i>just isn&#x27;t that big of a source of bugs</i>. Anecdotally, I very rarely see my program crash because of a nil pointer error, even while doing active development. I could hypothesize as to why this is, but I&#x27;ll just leave you with this thought: the type system isn&#x27;t the only thing that can reduce the occurrence of certain classes of bugs.",1382330838

The basic income causes the effective tax rate to start off negative and then become positive and approach the flat rate as income increases toward infinity. And you can make the curve be as flat or steep as you like by adjusting the flat marginal rate and the size of the basic income.<p>I suppose it&#x27;s true that you can&#x27;t change the slope of the effective rate curve beginning at a particular income level as you can with a progressive income tax, but it seems to me the reason for wanting that in the income tax case is in an attempt to emulate the curve you&#x27;re already getting with flat tax + basic income without having to complicate things by having a progressive income tax with a continuous marginal rate curve.",1382330374

6583309,comment,6581511,6581979,8,0,graue,,,"I actually have seen complaints about Go&#x27;s performance relative to other compiled languages, like C++, D and Java. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s coincidental that most of the Go converts come from a dynamic-language background. If you&#x27;re porting from Ruby, 2-3x slower than Java still seems blazing fast.<p>For me, Go misses the sweet spot entirely. A year ago I was curious about both Go and Clojure, my interest piqued by the strong concurrency support each has. I picked Clojure and have grown more and more confident in that choice.<p>Why not Go? In a language with nil pointers (Tony Hoare&#x27;s &quot;billion-dollar mistake&quot;), no generics, and sub-JVM performance, static typing just doesn&#x27;t seem worth it. Also, poor interop with other languages means Go can only draw from its own small community for libraries (contrast Clojure which makes using mature, well-tested Java libs trivial).<p>When Rust is more mature, it may be what I hoped Go would be: the safe language, with lightweight threads, that makes me never have to write C or C++ again.",1382329228

The distinction between a benign tumor and a malignant one is generally ascertained by the process of &quot;let&#x27;s watch it and see what it does&quot;, so I&#x27;m not convinced that &quot;cancer&quot; is defined more usefully than &quot;illness&quot;.<p>In my opinion, and my medically-educated mother&#x27;s opinion (really, I get it from her), people don&#x27;t look for &quot;a cure for cancer&quot; because they think they can make progress from that viewpoint.  They do it because they&#x27;re looking for funding.<p>edit:<p>You might compare &quot;died of cancer&quot; to &quot;died of old age&quot;. Old age used to be an accepted cause of death.  When autopsies started happening, it was quickly noticed that people who had died of &quot;old age&quot; always had some other, more immediate cause of death.  But it turns out that if you take an old person and do your utmost to prevent / cure / treat all of those more proximate causes, eventually one will get past you and they will die.",1382328113

Yes, SAP has the largest community network in the world with 3 million members. But it's not good enough at opening that up to the wider tech community, which is a loss.<p>Third, I think that integration to the wider tech community like HN, would be a huge benefit to Enterprise IT. We can be silo'd and the expertise of this group in writing nice-to-use apps is something we really need.",1323179978

3319232,comment,3318977,3318977,39,0,lucasjung,,,"I fly for a living, and I currently work in developmental flight test.  One of the programs I am working on is a UAV.<p>It's going to be a very, very long time before we see autonomous airliners.  I'll talk about specific technical hurdles, but I think the biggest issue is psychological: it's one thing to entrust a bunch of freight to an autonomous vehicle, another thing entirely to entrust dozens of living, breathing human beings to such (the article discusses this, including the concept of ""shared fate"").  I am confident that autonomous airliners will only come into service when autonomous aircraft technology reaches a point where the computers are able to handle <i>every</i> aspect of flight safety better than humans.  Right now they can already do <i>some</i> of those things better than humans, and those tasks have already largely been shed by human pilots and entrusted to their computers.  I think there will be a gradual transition as the computers are able to take on more and more of the tasks.  The article also mentions how this process is already causing basic aviation skills to atrophy in pilots who leave too much to the computers.  I think this is a very real problem, and I think it was a major contributor to the Air France flight 447 crash.  Prudent pilots do more manual flying than is strictly necessary because that's the only way to maintain proficiency.  If this problem becomes severe enough, expect to see the FAA establish more granular proficiency requirements.<p>The author talks a lot about how much the military is using UAVs, and seems to think that this is a good model for civilian applications.  It isn't.  The military has an entirely different set of risk considerations than civil aviation.  Take the example of medivac UAVs: a medivac UAV will almost certainly have a higher mishap rate than a manned medivac helo, which would be completely unacceptable for civilian purposes.  However, for the military that increased mishap risk is more than offset by the risks of putting an entire human crew into harm's way just to medivac a single wounded soldier.<p>Military UAVs currently in use generally have much higher mishap rates than their manned counterparts, but the military tolerates this because aicrew don't die in UAV mishaps, and UAVs are generally less expensive to replace than manned vehicles.  Part of the reason for this is that features designed to prevent or mitigate mishaps cost money, and it is often cheaper to leave many of them out and accept the higher mishap rate, especially when no human crew is involved.  However, part of it is that autonomous systems still just aren't as good at flying safely.  For the military, the benefits outweigh the costs, but I really can't see a for-profit corporation reachig the same conclusion.<p>><i>Northrop Grumman has built some sense-and-avoid savvy into the unmanned helicopters and other UAVs it's developing for the U.S. Navy.</i><p>I happen to be intimitely familiar with one such system, and somewhat familiar with another.  This sentence is utter BS.  I can only assume that the author was fed a line by an NGC PR-type and took it at face value.  A more honest way to say it would be:<p><i>Northrop Grumman is trying to incorporate limited sense-and-avoid capabilities into the unmanned helicopters and other UAVs it's developing for the U.S. Navy.</i><p>Moreover, FAA has a requirement for ""<i>see</i> and avoid,"" not ""sense and avoid."" The military is trying hard to sell them on the idea that it should be ""sense and avoid,"" of which ""see and avoid"" would be just a subset, but so far the FAA has remained deeply skeptical.  The FAA is right to be conservative about this change: none of the currently proposed systems would be as effective at collision avoidance as the Mark I Eyeball, and thus far the systems I am aware of (to which the quote from the article was referring) are still a <i>very</i> long way from working properly.  This seems to me like the kind of technical problem that eventually can be overcome, but it's going to take a lot of work to make that happen.<p>Because ""see and avoid"" is so critical to safety of flight, and because UAVs can't currently do it, the FAA does not allow UAVs to operate in its airspace, with some tightly restricted exceptions for military and law enforcement UAVs.  I doubt very highly if they would make similar exceptions for civilian purposes, and even if they did, the restrictions involved are so limiting that there aren't many viable applications.",1323179594

If you compare 8th graders to 8th graders (Asian-Americans scored 549[1]), you'll find that Asian-Americans came in a distant last place among all ethnic East Asians.<p>Still, somewhat ironically, you are both right. Underperforming ethnic groups in the US bring the average down, and the US educational Prime Directive of making sure the high-performing groups don't get ahead brings it down even farther. While Asian schools work hard to push Asian kids ahead, US schools refuse to do so, because that would just widen ""the achievement gap"" they're trying so hard to close. So US schools, first in spending, are last in effectiveness for ethnic Asian kids. That ""doing the least with most"" is <i>school</i> underperformance. The only reason Asian-American kids do as well as they do is that, like their cousins in Asia, they get a lot of their education outside of school.<p>[1] 2007 TIMSS results:

But the danger of clean, attractive, reductionist metaphors and analogies is that the general public -- including decisionmakers in the business world -- tend to reify the analogies, and treat them like immutable laws of physics.<p>Witness, for instance, the rise and fall (and rise again?) of ""The Long Tail."" As a concept, the long tail certainly applies to some businesses. But not to all, and not nearly as successfully as the concept's author once claimed. But the business world was frenzied with long-tail fever for years on end. ""Long tail"" became the buzz-phrase of the day, even in companies for whom the concept made no sense whatsoever. People with no understanding of the underlying principles could, nevertheless, grasp the surface-layer metaphor -- and, in so doing, assume that they understood the whole thing. That's a dangerous mindset.<p>So there's a sort of Faustian bargain in all of this.

3319110,comment,3318150,3319075,1,0,peteretep,,,"> This is the crucial flaw in the article's argument. The UK government is monetarily sovereign, and therefore always able to service its debt. That pretty much destroys the article's argument in favor of austerity.<p>This is almost true technically, but not true how it matters. In order to service ""unserviceable"" debt, they need to cause inflation. Expected inflation gets priced in to bond yields, and inflating your way out debt ends up being not very useful if you will then need to go back to the money markets at some point in the future.<p>But actually, your central point is also not quite true: the UK government is NOT monetarily sovereign - in theory anyway - because it's the BOE who sets the money supply in practice. And it's for this reason that they have an inflationary target. Can the government intervene? Almost certainly. Will this further fuck market confidence and drive up bond yields? Yes.

Hell, I don't read TC unless it is linked here and couldn't care less about them, but I assume that 'boring' is what came to their mind and (talking out of line here maybe?) connects with the majority of the readers. It sure as hell connects with me. SAP is boring. For me anyway.<p>Do people in the SAP eco-system think that their work is boring? I sure hope not.<p>Thing is: If someone says 'This is boring' then he's correct. That's an opinion, a feeling towards a subject. No need to argue about it. You can discuss _why_ that comes up or if TC should be opinionated like that in the first place, but the blog post fails to address that in any meaningful way.<p>That post seems to be a rant about 'Why aren't we considered interesting and ""cool"" although our software runs in a majority of the world's breweries' and the whole argumentation is flawed. As I wrote elsewhere: Market penetration doesn't make you interesting to people per se. Being the leader in 'world's transactions' (?) doesn't by default make you a sexy subject for the technology folks.<p>On a less serious side note:<p>I found it hilarious that someone defending SAP as being cool resorted to a comparison table.

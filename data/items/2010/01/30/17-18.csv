1088957,comment,1088713,1088713,0,0,frossie,,,"This being HN, let's talk about software.<p>I have seen people very wrong-headedly trying to apply rules to all employees because of one misbehaving person, under the misguided notion that this is somehow ""fair"". For example, a long time ago there was a person in the admin group that was basically a slacker - came in late, left early and didn't work very hard. Management got really annoyed by this and made a ""Everybody in by 9am OR ELSE, no exceptions"" rule. Well you can imagine how that went down will all us geeks who were slaving 14 hours a day till the witching hour to fix problems. They managed to piss off the most productive people in the building, instead of standing up to one person and saying ""you will be in by 9am, because that is when your manager needs you, and if you're not, you will be fired"".<p>So, unless you are managing an organisation that is so large, and you trust your middle management so little, that you can not address problems on a case-by-case basis, then stay away from sweeping rules. I'm with the OP on this one.",1264874032

I <i>think</i> it means that coffee automatically comes with one unit of cream and one unit sugar and that saying ""no cream no sugar"" is insufficient to remove them; instead you have to know the magic phrase ""black coffee"". My guess that the parent poster is only familiar with their local (NYC?) coffee culture where a regular coffee always comes with cream and sugar and thinks it applies everywhere else too.<p>In any rate, it doesn't matter at the vast majority of places where I order coffee because they won't even add cream and sugar for me if I ask for them-- I have to add them myself from a side counter.",1264871649

So a new job is created.<p>On the other hand, it is probably impossible to get funding for doing research as a business.

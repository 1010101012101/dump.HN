Sure, there are some, but I believe predictions and discussion regarding those effects to frequently be greatly exaggerated or completely unrealistic.<p>><i>Instead of issuing profits as dividends at all, corporations can hold the capital internally which causes share price appreciation...</i><p>Corporations would still have strong incentive to pay dividends. Dividends are a more direct means of providing participation in the company&#x27;s success (i.e. distributing profits) than stock appreciation (which is obviously a function of many other factors, including psychology). Solid dividends can thereby drive demand for the stock, and hence its price.<p>Shareholders might say, &quot;Don&#x27;t give me an increase on paper. Give me a payment on my current holding, while I maintain that holding&quot;. This is especially so if, as you say, shareholders are more reluctant to sell shares and trigger a larger personal tax event. However, again, I think the latter prediction is generally overstated.<p>The short is that each company is still competing for shareholders. Accruing cash well-beyond what the company can deploy to grow revenue is not in the interest of the company or its shareholders.<p>This is part of the fallacy around taxation and how it drives behavior. Companies aren&#x27;t just going to start doing things that are bad for them (e.g. making bad investments), simply to avoid taxation. And, they won&#x27;t withhold the dividend simply to prevent shareholders from incurring a tax event. This is <i>profit</i> that is being distributed to <i>shareholders</i>, just as now. No one is coming to take the investors&#x27; previous wealth (as is often implied). These taxes are simply deducted from what is otherwise a &quot;windfall&quot;.<p>><i>The problem is, at bottom, that taxing something discourages that thing</i><p>Yes, but again, I believe that many give too much weight to the degree to which it discourages, as well as to its &quot;distorting&quot; effects overall. People do not choose to opt out of investment (or profit-taking) altogether due to taxation. If I have a million dollar gain on a thousand dollar investment, then sure I&#x27;m going to cash out at some point. This, of course, is already happening on a regular basis. Even if you take half of it, it&#x27;s still a massive gain. And, what else I&#x27;m going to do with it? Hold it on paper forever where it has zero value? That&#x27;s not rational.<p>Yes, I&#x27;d wish there were no taxes (just as we wish there are no income taxes), but we are still going to work and invest to maximize our return, given the current environment.",1382345997

For example:<p>> <i>Language skills... nothing to say here. Every Swede can speak and write English. You won&#x27;t have problems here.</i><p>This is true insofar as that I&#x27;ve been studying Interaction Design in Sweden for one and a half years now (one half year to go) and I have not needed to learn Swedish. However, I&#x27;ve been informed that to get <i>employed</i> in Sweden it&#x27;s quite vital that you know Swedish. There&#x27;s plenty of jobs where you don&#x27;t even really need to know Swedish, but they demand it anyway to give the local people a bigger chance.<p>To give an example: I know of other students who couldn&#x27;t get a job delivering newspapers because they didn&#x27;t speak Swedish because, and I quote &quot;suppose a stranger on the street asks you for directions, how are you going to help them?&quot; which is obviousy part of the job description of newspaper delivery boy.<p>Can&#x27;t say how that translates for jobs like UX, although I hear similar stuff from graduates: knowing Swedish is almost necessary if you want to get employed.<p>I&#x27;m quite surprised about your fears at night - I live in Malm (which has a reputation) and have never felt threatened or in danger at all.",1382345747

6584223,comment,6582494,6582494,4,0,tashoecraft,,,"Google is creating a walled garden just like any other company does. The article points to how they are making their shift towards an operating system that is similar to ios (in terms of lock in). Android may be an open-source platform but, on the majority of devices that compete at the top level, it becomes far from open source.<p>It&#x27;s understandable why Google would lock people out of seeing the back end of their closed apps. But you have to look at what the long-term implications of them slowly removing support for ASOP apps are. As Google continually pushes out fantastic products that tie in so well to the mobile experience, why would anyone/developer want to have/develop [for] anything else. As this power grows, Google can strong-arm phone manufactures to develop hardware/features/etc to work with what they are developing. They have to sign contractual agreements to get the top version of Android and are then locked in to keep up the good terms. Google is outsourcing the hardware manufacturing to other companies and ensuring that if a user wants a good phone, they will be using their services.<p>Many people here are claiming any company can leave Google&#x27;s garden like Amazon did. While some companies may be able to do that, I&#x27;m struggling to think of a one with the technological background, money to invest, and callousness for risk who are willing to try. Amazon has a huge assortment of media that it can toss at its users who use their hardware. Other companies don&#x27;t have a differentiating factor or the software development to be able to make a truly competitive product to drive people away from Google supported Android. Just look at how much Microsoft, a software giant, is struggling to gain any shred of market share.<p>No executive in any reasonable company is going to propose to invest billions in order to squeeze into the highly competitive mobile OS market. Its a huge risk that only a startup could swallow, and yet few startups could even raise the money required to topple the Google supported android market.<p>What the future is starting to look like is the one Google was initially afraid of, that users were faced a Draconian future, a future whereone company, one device, one carrier would be [the] only choice. As Google gains more power, the open source part that Android users love is going to slowly disappear. This may or may not happen, there are many variables that could prevent it, but it is a future that would bring Google the highest return and that is the goal of all market traded companies.",1382345553

A good system is designed to encourage particular ways of thinking, with all features carefully and cohesively designed around that purpose. This essay will present many features!

It typically pays 100+ USD an hour, meaning a monthly income of 16K USD or so given a standard 40 hour workweek. If you have the skills (and it sounds like you do), the contracts are pretty easy to get by using agencies who are always looking for new development talent.<p>It&#x27;s very hard to jump directly into contracting in Sweden from Russia, particularly due to the whole work-visa problem. But once you are inside, it&#x27;s a very viable opportunity.<p>If your wife enjoys learning languages, there is free Swedish language education (she can even apply for a &quot;learning bonus&quot; of around 1000 USD pr 6 weeks or so). Once you are in, there&#x27;s also (almost) free health care and such.<p>Stockholm is a lovely city, and it&#x27;s only a 2,5 hour flight from Moscow, priced typically at around 400-500 USD round-trip.",1382345080

Maybe the app you need them to build is super simple, but if not, you&#x27;re doing yourself and your company a disservice by not hiring someone who&#x27;s done iOS before.<p>I&#x27;m speaking from experience here: I learned iOS (even after having previous MacOS X desktop devel experience) on the job, when a friend asked me to write an iOS app for her startup.  I learned quickly, but made a lot of mistakes in how I structured the app that came back to bite me months later.  If I&#x27;d had the time to start over from scratch, I would have done things quite differently and the whole thing would have been a lot easier.<p>And I was <i>slow</i>.

Also companies are completely free to not pick Android (Tizen / Firefox OS / ?) and they are free not to license the Google apps and put their own or (other) open source ones. It would be hard to make Google out to be a monopolist via that route.<p>MS was different; there weren&#x27;t much alternatives and the alternatives which were there were squashed by MS. People currently want the apps in the appstore; they want to play clash of clans; they don&#x27;t care about the Google gmail app. This being the same bubble world as the chromebook thread on HN yesterday; tech people think non tech people actually notice what they are running; they generally don&#x27;t. If they can play the games their friends are playing and if they can use &#x27;the software&#x27; they are used to they are happy. What brand it is is not important.<p>As an example; when I sit with any of my family members (they are all non tech), they will say &#x27;I will open up Word now&#x27; or &#x27; I will open up Excel now&#x27; to me when we need to organize something or go over numbers of one of the companies. What pops up definitely never is Word or Excel but rather Libre Office or Google Docs or some free Android/iPad variety. No-one I know actually has or uses MS Office; they use the terms because they don&#x27;t know &#x27;spreadsheet&#x27; and &#x27;word processor&#x27; is a mouthful. They don&#x27;t miss Windows and would even mostly hate it if they had to work with it now (after tablets or chromebooks and even Macs, Windows for non-tech people Windows seems incredibly hard and tech to use).<p>All these alternatives and Android being deployed by many different companies in different forms would make it hard to call Google a monopolist on that grounds.

Now I&#x27;m not so sure, mainly through my own personal experience.<p>For 5.5 years (2004-2009), I was a core developer and maintainer over at Xfce.  Over that span of time I wrote tens of thousands of lines of code, perhaps more.  I did this in addition to my job, which morphed from engineering project management to programming tasks that I didn&#x27;t find very challenging.<p>After I left that job, I joined a tiny, early startup.  The programming work there I found <i>very</i> challenging, and the insane hours quickly ate up any spare time I might put toward Xfce.  Eventually I realized that lacking a life outside of work made me sad, so I left.  Fast forward a little bit, and now I&#x27;m at another startup, which (while demanding, challenging, and rewarding) gives me time for outside pursuits and a social life.  But I don&#x27;t feel the desire to work on personal coding projects anymore.  The job fulfills my desire to write code, and outside of that I&#x27;d rather be, well... outside.<p>It&#x27;s interesting, because all my Xfce contributions are on git.xfce.org, and not on GitHub.  My GitHub account contains 2 personal projects: a semi-finished Android UI library (which was really only relevant and useful in the 2.x days), and a script for building a Gentoo image for a Raspberry Pi (which I&#x27;ve since abandoned as I mainly run Debian nowadays).  Looking at my GH account would be fairly unimpressive, and might even be worse than not having a GH account at all.<p>So I&#x27;d easily fail the GitHub test.  If a particular company was making that a no-go for getting through an interview pipeline, well... their loss, I guess.<p>I&#x27;m responsible for a fair bit of hiring at my current company, and I rarely ask about personal projects anymore, unless a candidate has one listed on their resume.  While I&#x27;m not always happy with the coding problems I usually give (they tend to be data-structure/algo problems that I&#x27;d probably have trouble solving in an interview setting), they <i>do</i> at least clearly show whether or not the candidate can write code, and I also get a rough idea of how cleanly they code, not to mention insights in how they approach and solve problems.  And not being able to completely solve the problem isn&#x27;t an auto-fail in my book either, as long as they tried to work on it and their approach (and whatever code they did write) was sound.<p>I do very strongly believe in the aptitude test + work sample formula as the best way to evaluate candidates, but the problem is more that it&#x27;s not always so easy to apply those tests in a traditional interview setting.  Maybe that just means we need to come up with a different way of interviewing, though.",1382343617

However, often you can learn the most interesting trait from asking a question which the candidate can&#x27;t answer right off the bat: How does the candidate deal with failure or lack of knowledge. Does she/he start guessing? Does she/he ask the right questions moving in the general direction of solving the problem?<p>I&#x27;m not checking for academic knowledge in interviews.<p>>  and even learn new paradigms when necessary.<p>This often requires knowledge about the stuff you don&#x27;t know.

I can&#x27;t remember all the sort algorithms I had to code, but I remember there&#x27;s more than one and that there are tradeoffs between all of them. So if I&#x27;m constrained on memory and have a pre-sorted list I can go luck up how bubblesort is implemented exactly. That&#x27;s a knowledge that self-taught programmers often lack [1].<p>> being good with maths and being a productive programmer are not necessarily two things that always come together.<p>No, nobody proclaimed so.

I see how muxing streams over a TCP session theoretically allows the TCP session to &quot;fill&quot; the available bandwidth for a longer period of time. But it also means that every stream in the session will suffer from a few packet drops (and the resultant &quot;sputtering&quot; slow starts over lossy physical media, ie. the mobile use-case).<p>As for why flow control is being pushed into the app layer, the answer again comes down to multiplexing of multiple streams over one TCP connection (since without stream-level flow control, one slow end-point for a stream can potentially block the progress of every other stream in that session... see discussion here: <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/spdy-dev/g4PiZBTW-34"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/spdy-dev/g4PiZBTW-34</a>)<p>I guess in the end, only real measurements with a mature implementation will answer the question.

It&#x27;s a service that I would expect the free market to be able to provide efficiently and it does not surprise me that it succeeds. The free market is very good at optimizing value creation under certain circumstances and it&#x27;s great that laser eye surgery matches up with those requirements.<p>Unfortunately, when it comes to policy we do not get to cherry-pick the conditions under which the rest of the system operates, and the other parts of the health care market run under conditions that demonstrably throw the free market for a loop (hence the system-level failures vs socialized systems I pointed out above). Cancer treatments cannot be paid for out of most people&#x27;s savings. &quot;Customers&quot; do not always have the chance to shop around between providers (w/o insurance) and those that do use insurance experience a 99% deleveraging effect because only the 1% that have extraordinary costs are in a position to examine the value of what they bought. Do you have a proposed mechanism of breaking information asymmetries, re-leveraging disproportionately expensive consumers, and standardizing the coverage provided by free market plans? Do you have a way of pricing the 5 externalities I listed into the insurance providers&#x27; budgets? Has your proposal been implemented in a dozen other countries and proven to be comparatively cost effective for decades?<p>What is your answer to the figures that show that our system in aggregate is 2-10x less efficient than comparable social systems?<p>Anybody can cherry pick a counterexample. Anybody can speculatively extrapolate it out to a convenient conclusion.

I am not a famous rockstar freelancer, but during recent 2 years I have been earning $7-$10k per month average, making my clients quite happy and being able to support my wife and our two children. Before starting freelancing I had been working for 8 years at a local publishing house where I got from an ordinary designer to a head of IT dept serving 20+ daily/monthly editions.<p>Now I feel like I am ready to perform a next step in my life, in regard to my career. Recently I have received a job offer from a company in Stockholm doing a software as a service, for a position of a frontend developer. I had a talk via Skype with a couple of representatives of the company and in the end they offered me to visit their office to have a detailed talk as they seem to be quite content with skill I have shown so far. Surely they offer benefits, work permit visa and other things like a vacation, insurance.<p>I googled for average salaries for a position like mine there in Stockholm as well as in other Sweden cities. I have also found some more info about life there, costs, conditions, climate and so on. I know &#x27;average salary&#x27; doesn&#x27;t give much info about my specific potential salary I can get there. But at least I see the range and it&#x27;s quite different from my current income knowing that I will have to pay for an apartment, likely pay more for food and other things I don&#x27;t yet know about. On the other hand, may be it will be a good start for me to go networking, finding new opportunities, improving my skills.<p>So, please advise, what things I should consider while deciding? Did you face similar choice when you were offered with a job while you were freelancing? How did you choose to accept or to reject a full time job? What are important factors for you? Can it be a real move forward or more like a deadlock turning me into a small gear in a big mechanism? How can I setup my priorities properly not to say in a year or two I have had lost them?<p>I know many of the questions are subjective but I would like to hear from people who were in the same situation like mine.<p>Thanks!",1382342687

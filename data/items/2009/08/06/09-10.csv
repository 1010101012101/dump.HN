The difference between 'retail' and 'bundle' discounts is a pretty good indicator software retail pricing is terribly wrong.<p>And then there is the fact that you could sell software online easily and you don't actually need a retail channel.<p>Direct-to-consumer is the only way that makes any sense at all. Why even have a physical goods channel for something that is outdated before it has left manufacturing ?<p>The other side of the coin is that now people are so used to being able to get that stuff for free that to reverse the trend away from wholesale copying is very difficult.<p>Plenty of people feel towards companies like microsoft the way they feel towards the taxman. You've already had me pay 6 times over to use this road, I refuse to pay you any longer. The profit margins of those companies don't help either.",1249552561

Most recommendations engines pre-compute stuff rather than generating the recommendations in real-time like we do""<p>I've been looking into recommendation algorithms recently (started with the excellent book ""Programming Collective Intelligence""), and this sounds lightyears ahead of the way we currently do things. I suppose you could take one of the algorithms that requires pre-computing and throw resources at it, but it seems like they are talking about something new.<p>Since I'm just getting started, I'd like to find some academic (or blog-faux-academic) articles on whatever recent advances behind recommendations without the need for precomputing.

745107,comment,745045,745075,0,0,tdm911,,,"My take on this though is that if the pricing was more affordable then piracy would be less prevalent. One of the reasons that OS X has a lower level of piracy is that their OS pricing is more affordable (I'll admit there are many other factors).<p>I don't have stats to back this up, but I would assume that Windows has an incredibly high percentage or pirated installs (given their attempts to combat this) and pricing is a big factor in this.",1249552084

(You'll know VP8 is the best when all the other codecs compare themselves to it!) But these claims are either just blatant PR BS or like On2 you make some very specific claims. If you read what they actually say it appears they think VP8 is ""better"" than H.264 when you also consider licensing.<p>Now I personally think that's very valid, as any royalty free codec that Google releases from this purchase will have a big advantage due to it's licensing, and that will make it ""better"" for many purposes. But it's not what codec nerds mean by ""better"".<p>Personally I agree with your point about codec improvements and  think that Google should get something out fast based on what they've bought, but they should also be looking for defectors from MPEG-LA to work on a next-gen royalty free codec by pooling a bunch of patents and expertise. It seems MPEG-LA has either been mismanaged or has fallen victim to internal politics so there's been plenty of unrest over the years.<p>Sun had some patents it was going to use in a royalty free codec called OMS and they're already licencing VP6 for JavaFX so that's a good place to start.",1249549740

They have a super-strong strong brand and their products often fetch higher prices and profit margins than their competitors.  This gives them a strong incentive to protect their brand, and the means to do so.<p>Part of the reason their products can demand a premium price and healthy profit margins is because they have high standards for quality, profit margins and quality both rely on a strong and well managed supply chain.  This well managed supply chain gives Apple greater ability than most to extract compliance with their required labor standards.  The demand for quality means, in part, that Apple's suppliers make a greater investment in training their workers, which makes retaining those workers more important.<p>If Apple's suppliers attract and retain workers with better pay and better working conditions, then that creates pressure on other manufacturers, who must improve the package they offer workers in order to keep them from going to work for Apple's suppliers.<p>I'm sure there are other good targets for this sort of pressure, but Apple has to be among the best.",1327283747

I am an engineer and, given the possibility, I'd be designing processor architectures and instruction sets. I also like programming - and do it for a living, but I have lost some of my taste for algorithms and data structures and prefer to generate competitive differentials elsewhere on the stack. But I am also very worried by the political background, both here in South America, where I live, in Europe, where my ancestors came from, and with the US, which is a very fine country where a lot of dear friends live and that we shouldn't allow to be ruined by a bunch of crazy people. When I was a teenager, I read 1984 and the idea something like that could happen scared me a lot. It still does. Bad politics is contagious.<p>I think all is fine, as long as we remain civilized and don't forget to disagree in constructive ways. Community and relationships are important too - I have only one nickname, after all, one which is easily identifiable. All my friends know who I am, where I came from and what my opinions tend to be.

You have to license different works for different purposes, and there are many, many stakeholders whose permission you have to get.  This varies by country.  For example, a network may by the exclusive rights to air a show in the US.  They only pay for those rights.  Then someone else buys the exclusive rights in the UK.  And someone else buys another country.  Then, when it comes time for internet streaming, you not only have to get licenses from the original owner, plus perhaps this organization or that organization, and then you have to get licenses from....<p>You get the point.  So with all of that work involved they look at the revenue potential of smaller countries and, frankly, it's just not worth it in many cases.  They don't know what the demand is there.  They don't have a marketing plan, and they have bigger opportunities available to them by working on yet another show's licensing for the US or other large country, so they just don't go to all of that trouble to make things available in smaller markets.",1327283271

3498621,comment,3498202,3498202,3,0,IgorPartola,,,"Making a movie requires a very special set of circumstances and people. Consider all the involved:<p>- Director, actors, writers and crew. The creative team behind the movie.<p>- The producer: the business side.<p>- The movie studio: the financial, marketing and distribution side.<p>When YC asks for startups to think of ways to ""Kill Hollywood"", they are talking about the last category. So far I have not seen a single comment talking about cutting out directors or producers. The problem is the movie studios, and their Walmart-like hold on the industry.<p>Now that that's established, what can we do about this? How to we break up the relationships between the creative team and the movie studios? I see several ways:<p>1. We need a simple and cheap distribution channel. In 20 years there will be no movie theaters. They might remain as a novelty, but 90% of them will be gone. They are already not making much money and as home theater setups get better, there is no way that people will want to go to a theater and overpay for the soda and popcorn. Platforms like Roku and iTunes or ""networks"" like Hulu and Netflix are the future. Allowing people to publish directly to these channels and making it transparent how much return there is ""per view"" is key here.<p>2. We need independent marketing for movies. A director who, for the sake of the argument, self-financed a movie needs a way to market it. This is analogous to a web app developer marketing her app via Google AdWords. Once again content platforms like Roku and iTunes can help greatly here since they already have access to lots of people and are common places to seek movie trailers, etc.<p>3. We need a new source of finance. The problem is that a successful blockbuster movie takes many millions of dollars and someone has to front the money before any return is made. This problem has some technical solutions. For one, we could create a web app that matches the creative team with potential investors. The investors get to read the script, watch the castings, even interact with the team if they for example are looking to invest >$10k, etc. Then if the movie meets its budget (the interface would be similar to Donors Choose), production starts. Investors wait, watch and pray, potentially even trading their investments in these movies (this is risk sharing after all). Once the movie is made it goes into marketing and distribution and the returns come in, where they get split up between the investors.<p>The above are not business plans, just a quick brainstorm of different approaches to disrupting or evolving the industry. I have no experience making movies beyond taking videos with my phone so this is a bunch of hogwash with 99.5% probability.",1327283032

3498591,comment,3496943,3498148,2,0,mekoka,,,"It seems to me that you're arguing only for the sake of it. In my original reply I addressed the perceived cause and effect of why women are under-represented in the videogame industry. I disagreed with the quick and easy finger pointing toward game designers as the original culprit. I redirected attention to historic games that were gender neutral and that were shunned by the female gender, due most likely to social prejudices, that videogames are a guy thing. You replied to my arguments by implicitly inferring that the games I cited as examples were somewhat gender biased. I added some arguments to the contrary.<p>Now you use Ms Pac-man's <i>logo</i> as the basis of your argument about the genderization in the <i>game</i>? Have you actually <i>played</i> any of these games? The last thing I remember from any of them was the packaging. Do you remember what the actual graphics or game-play was like at all? You force yourself to see ""hyper-gendered incarnation"" and to me, this is an example of what I believe the problem was originally with games: adults meddling in kids business, because they thought they saw something, that would normally have gone unnoticed to children. That's how we ended up with girls thinking that videogames are for boys. Someone had to tell them that.<p>Mario could have been after the golden treasure, or the secret chamber, or delivering the princess, or whatever, it made absolutely no difference to game play. People (boys and girls alike who enjoyed these games) didn't care. Ms Pac-man was a round yellow dot walking around in a labyrinth and swallowing ghosts. My friends and I played these without even knowing any English, so we had no idea what was being said in all the written messages, nor did we really care about the objective, we just enjoyed going stage after stage and defeating the ""boss"". In the case of Mario, we had no clue that the little person at the end of the stages was a girl, let alone a princess that we needed to eventually deliver. That's definitely not what enticed us to play and I don't believe that's what deterred girls to do the same. Mario could have been an old wizard, some type of sea monster and yes, a girl, the outcome would be the same, if there was game play, we would be there.<p>I haven't played any games in eons, but a quick look in a videogame store showed me evidence that today the offering in games is rather skewed toward young male. I am absolutely not in disagreement and actually agreed with the observation previously, but this was not the argument, but rather what's the root cause of the situation, since it pertains to aspect of the main debate on the thread: women and technology. The 2 games that you cited Arkham City and DC New 52, I've never heard of, so I won't dispute your claims. I would however underline the fact that they're recent releases and bear no weight in our current discussion.",1327281935

For the life of me, I can't recall the name, but it was a directory of links (mostly MP3s at the time) and the client appeared to be a SMB client which connected directly to individual PCs for files.<p>Man, I wish I could remember the name of that program.<p>Hell, if this file-sharing take-down shit keeps up, we'll end up on USENET again.  Better yet, TOR will finally go mainstream.",1327280787

Nevertheless, it might actually be a decent bet for newbies to the screenwriting trade.<p>As you've mentioned, and as I concur, your odds of getting discovered in Hollywood are somewhere just shy of your odds of getting beamed aboard the Enterprise. So Amazon's system represents a slightly better way to get a calling-card film made out of your script. Nevertheless, it's a much shittier deal for anyone who's had a script sold or made. So this seems like a one-and-done sort of deal. Get discovered on Amazon, then go get an agent in Hollywood, and eventually, make lots more money than through this system.<p>Amazon's system needs some way to scale up as the writer's career does. Or else it's always going to be stuck as a AAA farm team for Hollywood. That might not be a bad thing; at least it's a toehold in the business. But it's not going to bring down the system anytime soon.<p>Unless, of course, the entire cost structure of the film industry changes, and Hollywood stops being able to afford higher-end writers' paydays. Which may indeed happen, sooner or later. Hollywood has a cost-side crash on its hands eventually. It's anyone's guess as to when, but it will happen. Revenues can't keep declining, year over year, while talent costs and budgets keep climbing.",1327280610

There's no way you can tell the story of ""Star Wars"" without scale models, expensive cameras, good actors, and special effects.<p>However, even though Primer only cost a few $K to make, there was nothing ""minimal"" about it.  The entire story needed to be told, and the process of filmmaking already includes editing and pairing down the story.  I think that the notion of thinking of products and movies as both things which have unique and compartmentalizable ""features"" (which lead to the notion of MVP) is a flawed analogy for this reason.<p>I think that we agree the process of MAKING movies is OK, but the process of distribution and consumption is what needs the change.<p>Oh, and these movies are awesome.",1327280466

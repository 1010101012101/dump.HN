503894,comment,503326,503326,0,0,gommm,,,"I strongly believe that having a grading system where a number of people need to have A for the grading system to be considered fair is harmful.
In the university I went to in France, exams are made so that the gaussian curve of results in centered around 60% (12/20 in the french way of counting) with grades under 40% considered to be failing grades.
Once you start having this kind of grading system, it forces the examinator to make the test hard and for that the best way is to have long tests (around 3-4 hours) where you have to apply the knowledge you gained on small projects (example a compilation exam where you have to work on a simplified subset of a natural language). Added to this, there was a healthy distrust of multiple choice questions and teachers who asked too much of them were considered by everyone as being lazy.<p>Contrast this with tests I took in the US at RIT where the questions were ""When was the OpenGL committee founded?"" (for a computer graphics class) or other such useless questions.<p>Homework was also different between both universities... In France, the graded homework were mostly medium to large size projects that took quite a few weeks to complete. In the Us, there was a much a higher number of busy work with small simple to do exercise that didn't really make student learn a lot (although I did have a few interesting homework projects so not everything was bad)...",1236227479

503885,comment,501825,503731,0,0,anamax,,,"> Top marginal rate is 35% now.<p>There's a surtax that puts it at 39+.<p>> The SSI stops after 105k (or so),<p>Today.<p>> Phaseout deductions never _increase_ marginal tax rates, so also immaterial.<p>Phaseouts affect the amount of income taxed and thus affect the amount of taxes due for a given increase in income.  Suppose that earning $1k more costs me $300 in deductions due to phaseouts.  The result is that my AGI has gone up by $1.3k.  Assuming no bracket change, the taxes owed because of that $1k increase is 1.3x the bracket rate.<p>Let's put some numbers on it.  Suppose that the tax rate for that bracket is 10%.  That's $100 for the $1k and $30 for the $300 for a total of $130 owed.  Do you really want to argue that the marginal rate for that $1k is not 13%?<p>I also left out sales taxes.  Their effect depends on what the mix of goods purchased (at least some food is tax free in most jurisdictions while gas, tobacco, and booze isn't) and the average tax rate up to that point.<p>For a state like CA, with sales taxes typically over 8% and soon to be 9%, that can add another 3-5% to the marginal tax burden.",1236226882

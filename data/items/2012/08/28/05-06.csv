When I've investigated in the past (but in the OS X era---it seems generally accepted that Macs were sold at a hefty premium in the 80s and 90s), I've generally found the price difference to by in the ~10% neighborhood.<p>I just priced out a grossly-similar laptop to the Macbook Pro Retina at Dell's website, and came up with a Latitude E6520 with a price of $1931.  Less than a Macbook Pro Retina by about 15%.  The Latitude has a slightly faster processor, a graphics chip with half as much video memory, no retina display, weighs ~1.5 lbs more, and (I suspect) lacks Apple's all-around build quality.<p>However, a System 76 laptop with similar specs as the MBPR costs $1153.  But that's with only the Intel HD 4000 graphics (no NVIDIA chip), and, again, no retina display.<p>So, I don't know.  Can anyone offer some insight into why the System 76 system is so inexpensive compared to the base-model MBPR and the Latitude above?<p>I know that Dell sells, for instance, Inspirons, which are much cheaper than Latitudes, but my understanding is that these machines are essentially composed of whatever components can be bought most cheaply this week, and so they pose maintenance headaches, because it may be difficult to obtain a component that dies a year after purchase.  Also, my personal experience with Inspirons is that they have very poor build quality.",1346132363

I ask because you give no reason for TechCrunch (or anyone else) to cover your app. What is special about it? Why would TechCrunch's audience be interested? Most of these types of websites have some type of ""intro letter"" explaining the benefits to the intended audience, which you are currently lacking.<p>3) Your video is pretty good (and helps me figure out what the app actually does!)...so why do you have it hidden in the bottom corner of the website and behind an additional click at that?  Put it above the fold and make it easy for people to actually watch it! This could also solve point #1 mentioned earlier.<p>4) This is more of a personal thing, but I took issue with the line ""we even made this better looking than our site!"" Why should this random microsite be ""better"" than your app's real website? It made me curious, so I started looking for a link to the main website. I didn't find anything immediately and only then realized I had to click on the logo. So I clicked over and I think your ""real"" website is actually much better.

Sometimes it feels like you can find at least one misuse of ""ad hominem"" on every comment thread on reasonably popular sites.  Similarly, many people like to dismiss arguments by just saying ""slippery slope"" and moving on.<p>As you mentioned, slippery slopes are not inherently invalid.  In fact, the real fallacious use of a slippery slope is hardly related to it being a slippery slope at all!<p>Assume a slope A->B->...->Z.  Further, assume that each step of this chain is known to be true with 100% accuracy.  That is to say that we can perfectly predict that if A happens then B will happen and if Q happens R will happen.  Thus, simple transitivity shows that if A will happen Z will definitely happen.  If Z is complete destruction of the Earth you probably won't find many people saying that it will be perfectly okay if we do A because slippery slopes are invalid.<p>However, slippery slope arguments often have a much smaller probability of occurring at each step of the chain.  You often get things like ""if we don't have a death penalty then people won't be afraid of killing people so murder rates will go up so you'll get pregnant and die"".  Clearly there is no part of this chain that occurs with probability 1 (except, as Mean Girls tells us, getting pregnant->death).  In fact, most of the chain is fairly low probability and composing them as such makes it even smaller.<p>To make this a bit clearer again, let's take our A->B->...->Z chain and make each step of the chain have a .9 probability.  If A happens, B will occur with .75 chance and if Q happens, R will occur with .75 chance.  Since there are 25 hops on this we can see that the probability of Z occurring given A is actually .75^25 = .00075 (ish).  Even if each individual step seems reasonable (I mean, hey, it will happen 3 out of 4 times!) the full composition is just laughably unlikely.<p>However, it seems that GP was actually talking about a continuum fallacy rather than a slippery slope as we've discussed.",1346130823

I suspect that the knowledge required <i>to be useful</i> is about 70-30, or maybe 85-15, heavily on the coder side.<p>To pick up some marketing ideas that will start moving the needle on your startup, read a small book. You'd probably already know enough to start iterating on 3 or more techniques.<p>To get a marketer to pick up the most basic coding skills, start with flow control and variables. It could be a month before you're useful, in one language only. Then understand HTML, SQL, the server-side language, maybe jQuery, plus maybe security so you don't start adding lots of useful but dangerous code. Understand performance, so you don't kill the server with a loop in customer-facing code. Not just be able to click a ""add new test"" button, but integrate ABingo without hassling the rest of the team (if that's the best tool for the job). The point is: whatever it takes. You need to know enough technical concepts to be fast and loose with whatever will move the needle best. You're making few marketing decisions, but many technical ones.<p>So: fully agreed with your other comment.

We should reject abstract categories for our identities because once we do define ourselves by them, we start reconstructing our thoughts and beliefs to actually fit the stereotype for that abstract category. Much better to focus on the actual specific beliefs without committing to a tribal identity, both for your sake and so that other people are less likely to commit the submitted article's fallacy against you.",1346130153

4442219,comment,4441734,4441734,38,0,breckinloggins,,,"The article could use some more neutral and left-leaning ""Worst argument in the world (TWAITW)"" examples.  I'm fairly neutral politically, and the piece sounded left-biased to me.  Note that I'm not stating my opinion here; the author even apologizes for it in the article.<p>Perhaps he is simply at a loss for examples?  We could help.  Here's a neutral one (from the comments):<p>- ""George Washington was a <i>traitor</i>!"" (should probably be used BEFORE the Martin Luther King argument; in extremely conservative circles, even mentioning Dr. King's name rings the ""ding! ding! liberal!"" bells)<p>Here are some left-leaning ""argumentoids"" that you sometimes hear and that have elements of TWAITW:<p>- ""But guns <i>kill</i> people!""  I realized shortly after reading the article that this is not only an instance of TWAITW, but shows the logic behind the retort ""Guns don't kill people, people kill people"".  This might be rephrased as saying ""yes, guns kill people, but not in the way that murderers kill people, which is to say, with malicious intent.  That requires a person, so let's concentrate on whether removing guns from the economy will prevent those with malicious intent from obtaining them.""<p>- ""Evolution is a <i>fact</i>!""  Yes, but maybe not in the ""totality of the truth is plain for all to see"" perspective.  It is true that PARTS of evolution are plain fact, but the creationist has a point that some of the more fantastic parts of evolution are harder to directly observe in the same way as, say, gravity.<p>- ""Reproductive freedom is a <i>choice</i>!""  Perhaps, but you can't just dismiss the argument at that point.  Choice can mean ""choosy moms choose Jiff"" or it can mean ""the difference between life and death"".  Saying it is a choice ignores the fact that not all personal ""choices"" are accepted by society (i.e. it is your choice and you can make one, but sometimes there are consequences).<p>- ""Tax breaks for the rich are <i>unfair</i>!"" Perhaps, but there are many levels of unfair.  You must argue why tax breaks for the rich are at the same level of unfair as, say, separate water fountains for whites and blacks and not unfair as in ""it's unfair that I always have to pull the cookie jar from the top shelf just because I happen to be the tall one.""<p>Note that all of these lean more toward ""equivocation"" than the author's technical definition of TWAITW.  But then, perhaps that's what TWAITW boils down to.<p>Also, I note in all of these that they are all caricature arguments.  They are all cliched.  The arguments in the article have a similar nature.<p>This leads to a disturbing point: it is helpful to have TWAITW as an analytical tool when having a serious debate, but if you are ""debating"" with a person who shouts soundbites like these in your face, do you really think they are going to understand or care if you try to explain to them that they are using TWAITW?  Seems like more preaching to the choir, unfortunately.",1346130019

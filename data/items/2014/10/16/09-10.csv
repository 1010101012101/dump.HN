Every single ballot is available for recount activities, which can be done manually, under court and multiple party supervision.<p>Audits are performed and the stats on these and margins of error are well understood.  We do use electronic counting, and where those do not match audit records, work is performed until they do.<p>There isn&#x27;t a fully transparent electronic system, without also personally identifying voters to their votes.<p>I realize you guys do it differently.  That&#x27;s fine.

So long as that is true, we really do need to record voter intent in such a way that it can be used directly for the tally and reviewed under the public eye.<p>Which means e-voting is not trustworthy in the US.  VBM is trustworthy, and it delivers very high and consistent turnout rates too.<p>That&#x27;s another difference.  You guys use mandatory voting.  We don&#x27;t.

Many people (like myself and presumably you) don&#x27;t think that way around, and want a smartphone in a smaller form, but I think we are less likely than that other market segment to buy a new phone every year which is skewing the market away from our preferred direction.<p>I need to replace my Lumia 920 (after many drops I&#x27;ve finally manage to crack part of the screen, and the flash stopped working a short while ago) and the size thing is annoying.

I was expecting some fact-based, data-driven insights/perspectives from Google - so, for me I&#x27;d say the &quot;insights&quot; seem disappointingly shallow because they are just &quot;opinions&quot;.<p>I keep hearing that one of the big way in which &quot;how google works&quot; is different is that their &quot;people operations&quot; (HR) runs very differently from other companies. I would have loved to understand - how?<p>&quot;What&#x27;s different now?&quot; is such a, I am sorry to say, stupid question. Depending on anyone&#x27;s opinion, their world view, whether they think macro or micro - the answer can range from &quot;nothing at all&quot; to &quot;everything is different&quot;. Lets take communication as an example - &quot;what&#x27;s different now?&quot; - depending on who you talk to, they can argue that the fundamental needs are just the same (just forms have evolved) or someone can argue that things are radically different now because of X (where X could be snapchat or any new-age medium etc.). The same is true for entertainment - I have had discussions where I was convinced that the &quot;fundamental need to be entertained&quot; is just the same, but I also see so many new media around (so of course, its different now).<p>It would have been great if they had given more insights on how a successful internet age company truly works from the inside - a bit more than &quot;its best to work in small teams, keep them crowded, and foster serendipitous connections&quot;. I thought Eric/Google could contribute a new perspective to this discussion, given their vantage point. Otherwise its just another tautological business/self-help book.<p>I am a bit disappointed because Google&#x27;s vantage point in this world is so unique (they see so many things in the world, that others don&#x27;t - given their reach & size) - that they could have really added something very positive and new to &quot;What&#x27;s different now&quot;.<p>The whole point about &quot;Smart Creatives&quot; also seems so shallow - for hundreds of years and maybe before, &quot;Smart Creatives&quot; as they have defined it, are having tremendous impact! Where is the &quot;So what?&quot;  \nI understand that this is just a teaser to encourage people to read the book. If so, its just bereft of any fact-based, data-driven, truly unique perspectives or insights that I, personally just won&#x27;t bother.",1413450891

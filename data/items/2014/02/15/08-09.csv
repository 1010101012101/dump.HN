7243159,comment,7242920,7243010,3,0,masklinn,,,"> I guess it depends on whether an industry is growing in employment and importance<p>No, it depends on the country&#x27;s cultural background. The US (and France, for instance) have a history of adversarial labour relations, where labour negotiations are a war and the goal is to defeat the other party into submission (for labour) or destruction (for companies). Germany and scandinavian countries are rooted in much more cooperative labour relations which is why e.g. they don&#x27;t need <i>legally mandated</i> minimum wages, they have minimum wages from collective agreements.<p>And when a company whose culture is rooted in the adversarial model lands in  a cooperative country things get bad[0]. I&#x27;d also expect an interesting time with a company built around the cooperative model in the midst of an adversarial culture and hoped VW&#x27;s TN plant could be one such, but apparently that&#x27;s not going to happen.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/05/business/workers-of-amazon-divergent.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/05/business/workers-of-amazon...</a>",1392454798

7243137,comment,7243021,7243110,25,0,_delirium,,,"Perhaps not <i>enough</i> people who operate websites for profit, but there are a reasonable number of us working on PaaS/SaaS products where using Facebook Connect is out of the question because of data-protection laws, which does leave a pain-point around user management. The current gold standard is &quot;roll your own&quot;, but Persona is an interesting alternative.<p>Why aren&#x27;t people using it even in that sphere? One issue is that it&#x27;s precisely when you need to take advantage of the federated aspect that the win on up-front effort is weakened. By the time you&#x27;re setting up your own in-house Persona server rather than using Mozilla&#x27;s, you&#x27;re probably at the point where it&#x27;s less effort to just use some crappy off-the-shelf account-management system that comes as a CMS plugin. This might be counteracted if using Persona improved conversion, but that&#x27;s a chicken-and-egg problem as long as users don&#x27;t recognize Persona.<p>The other bit imo is that the security downsides of roll-your-own are a bit of an unpriced externality. If you have a password breach, it&#x27;s bad PR for a bit, but legal liability around it is relatively toothless: data-protection laws seem not to care about mere incompetence in keeping users&#x27; data private. Make your users pick passwords with at least 2 digits and 2 non-digit characters and you&#x27;ve &quot;done your part&quot;. So rolling your own crappy login system doesn&#x27;t have as big a downside for you the provider as for your users. The users, for their part, are oblivious to the risk before the fact, and lack serious legal recourse after the fact, so they&#x27;ll go along with your crappy in-house signup system, and shoulder the risk.",1392454302

It&#x27;s a good idea to scan all the JSON records and detect any surprises before committing to a given table design.<p>And there&#x27;s no reason to store the array&#x27;s contents twice. A properly designed table should allow the fields to be accessible regardless of how they&#x27;re stored. It&#x27;s up to you whether to store them as separate (and separately named) fields or as an array. But some databases, MySQL included, don&#x27;t have an array datatype, so if you decide to use MySQL you would want to break out each array member as a separate string field.<p>Finally, you need to add a primary key field to your design, for multiple reasons.",1392454297

7243080,comment,7242265,7242928,3,0,_delirium,,,"I agree, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just that you can&#x27;t play with the latest node.js module: you also can&#x27;t really spend time on developing new technology or making real technological advances, especially anything that has high risk or a >12 months to payoff. A startup&#x27;s main job is to put together a product, ASAP, and ideally also monetize it. This usually means relying on technology that has already been developed, at least mostly: it&#x27;s not the place for R&D. An ideal situation for a startup is that the technology already exists, maybe has even been lightly validated, but just hasn&#x27;t been turned into a product. You see the market opening, and you take some existing pieces of technology, putting them together into an MVP with the right pitch and business strategy.<p>There are some exceptions for startups whose real pitch is precisely the R&D, and who are able to pull large amounts of up-front funding from investors who are willing to bet on the technological development. Tesla is one example, in part because Musk&#x27;s large amount of self-funding meant it could afford to take a full 5 years between founding and product-to-market. Very few startups have 5-year R&D runways, though; if you want to do R&D on that timescale you&#x27;re usually better off at a place like Google or MSR, in parts of academia, or even a big engineering company (BBN, Lockheed, Intel, etc.).",1392451846

There&#x27;s very strong traditional gender roles in Mongolia within households, though the women fall into a sort of loose warrior-matriarch ideal like the way we see Sparta depicted in movies. But it&#x27;s not &quot;women&#x27;s equality&quot; the way, say, Scandinavia is.<p>It might be accurate, in a sense, but without context it&#x27;s misleading.

While node.js is not my cup of tea, I can see how that be fun (I enjoy playing with the latest OCaml libraries, C++11 features, golang, etc..), but ultimately that alone isn&#x27;t about technology. To me building technology is about reading a paper, extracting the core ideas, and applying them knowledge to implement a feature customers and no competitors offer is.<p>If we take this definition of technology, then there&#x27;s <i>plenty</i> of place in startups for people who love technology. It depends on what the startup is building: if innovative technology (as opposed to an innovative business model) is at the core of the company&#x27;s product, it&#x27;s a great place for technologists. (There is of course nothing wrong with innovative business models -- nor are innovative business models mutually exclusive with innovative technologies; indeed, some of the greatest companies have combined the two!)<p>Now with big companies it is absolutely true that even if technology is not the core, challenges around availability, scalability, performance, etc... necessitate more than a trivial investment in technology.<p>&quot;Startup&quot; and &quot;big company&quot; are also not binary. I&#x27;ve joined LinkedIn when it was may be 200-300 people and even then we were solving some rather tough technical problems (you can read about some of the problems we solved in this paper that was accepted to USENIX FAST -- <a href=""http://static.usenix.org/events/fast/tech/full_papers/Sumbaly.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.usenix.org/events/fast/tech/full_papers/Sumbal...</a>).

It&#x27;s very hard to make any generalizations and make categerical statements such as &quot;if you love technology and tinkering, you should absolutely not work at a startup&quot; or &quot;to enjoy startups you have to love technology&quot; (there are plenty of great startups founded by people who loved something more than they loved technology -- and these startups have made my life much more enjoyable as well!) I&#x27;ve done work that I am proud of in companies ranging in size from 15 to 14,000 people and learned tons in all of these environments (with various trade offs for companies of different sizes).<p>(Shameless plug: I hack on distributed systems in C++ at Cloudera -- and we do plenty of other cool things, despite not being a big company.

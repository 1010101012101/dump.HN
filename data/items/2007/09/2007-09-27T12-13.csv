And the claims you see are no doubt filtered by the popular press. Be careful with sweeping generalizations there. But don't ignore the fact that very good work has already been done, and we know much more than we did even five years ago - even for something as  seemingly ephemeral as ""morality"" (though we'll never get to ""why"" - that's a space I'm happy to leave to armchair philosophers around the interent).<p>What we know is that solving different sorts of moral problems (of the JS Mills or Kant type) involves different brain systems. And these experiments were conducted by a Ph.D. in philosophy who bemoaned the state of the modern field, and went on to do excellent neuroimaging work. <p>Read for yourself: <a href=""http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~jgreene/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~jgreene/</a>",1190897337

Once you figure out you can bill whatever you can negotiate, it makes it really hard to do startup work. The most dangerous part about it is that you always know you can pick up a bag of cash if you need it. When you've always got an attractive and easy ""out"", it's always out there calling to you. Yet another reason to do your startup when you are as young as possible.",1190896613
60224,comment,60216,60216,0,0,imgabe,,,"Yes! All it would take is a slight delay (1-5 minutes, even better if the user could set it) after sending the email before it's actually sent. Too many times I've forgotten to attach a file or something else stupid like that and realized it immediately after hitting send.

60221,comment,58025,58025,0,0,olavk,,,"Those that don't know the history of philosophy are doomed to repeat it. For example Marx wrote in 1845 ""Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point, however, is to change it."" This is almost exactly what PG is proposing.<p>Also, that statement that ""all previous philosophy is bollocks"" is a literary device used by numerous philosophers. ",1190895502

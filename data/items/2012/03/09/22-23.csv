As you mention, there are safer routes to get money. I am describing something I have observed in Silicon Valley, especially in the last few years. \nYou have the lucky folks who flipped their Company fast, and sometimes see themselves as the master of the universe. You also have the dedicated ones - and Dennis Crowley from Dodgeball and Foursquare is definitely in this category.<p>I think it is sad, especially because of all the efforts that we as entrepreneurs put into these Companies. \nMost of all, I criticize this general sentiment in SV right now, that success=money through acquisition/IPO.\nIf SamA gets his vision realized through Green Dot - all the better for him and for the Loopt team!

If you start by saying ""I'm going to solve poverty"", about a year in everyone will say ""Why haven't you solved it yet?"" and you'll find it very hard to find people to help you.  You end up accomplishing far less than if you said ""I'm going to help a hundred underprivileged but talented high-school kids find colleges that are appropriate for them and give them their best shot of getting in.""<p>I found that one of the worst and hardest mental habits to kick was the notion that I had to do ""big, important things"".  Because big, important things are ill-defined, and your success metrics aren't clear.  It's very easy to kid yourself into thinking that you're promoting justice for all, right up until you're 20 years in and the world is still not a just place.  And then you have a mid-life crisis, think you're a failure, and give up.<p>It's much better if you can point to specific and yet often underwhelming-sounding instances of ""I made this person's life better"" or ""I let this person do something he otherwise would not have been able to"".

There's a handy gem ""less-rails-bootstrap"" which wraps twitters bootstrap files and integrates with the Rails asset pipeline, but again, you should avoid this if you're not running on an up-to-date Intel system, since it has a dependency on ""therubyracer"" gem (which is V8 for ruby).<p>I have been using SimpLESS a little bit in the recent past, but it does choke on some of the bootstrap less files, and I haven't had the time to fork and rebuild it with a more up to date less library.<p>I think if I was coming to bootstrap now rather than a few weeks ago, I'd have chosen the sassified version rather than less, but fortunately I have an intel system to abuse, so all is not completely lost.",1331333339
3686331,comment,3685698,3686251,2,0,JoshTriplett,,,"Google has done several forms of personalization before ""search plus your world"":<p>- Google detects your location (using GeoIP and similar) and personalizes results that way, both by redirecting you to google.$countrycode and by providing location-specific search (such as map results).  You can't turn off the location-specific results, you can only make them more vague (by setting your location as a country rather than a city).<p>- Google detects if your IP address comes from a .edu; among other things, visiting google.com from a .edu will produce a message at the bottom of the homepage saying ""Graduating?  Come work with us!""<p>- Unless you turn it off, Google personalizes search results based on what you've previously searched for and clicked on.<p>Personally, I think this article has done nothing more than mistake correlation for causation, by saying that because Google keeps adding more personalization and Google's usage keeps growing, that therefore people must like personalization despite people saying they don't want it.  I'd suggest instead that people dislike personalization just as they say they do, but that people either don't hate it enough to switch, or don't feel they have a credible alternative to switch to.",1331333301

3686324,comment,3685444,3685444,7,0,pron,,,"Everything here could be summarized under the headline ""solve people's annoying, day-to-day problems (in an original manner)"". There are some great perspectives here, but I have a (little) problem with the premise of ""solve people's annoying problems"". I understand that this probably was a business talk to people interested in entrepreneurship, and, certainly this is great advice for people wanting to build a profitable business. But in the end, this is all it is: ""how to make lots of money from software? Answer: solve people's annoying problems"".<p>In a society where engineers are arguably playing an increasingly important role, I think this outlook is too limited. This perspective is what I would expect in a CPA convention. If engineers are so smart, powerful and essential, is this what you want to inspire them to do? Have them make cooler gadgets, easier ""content consumption experience"", better to-do lists to make people more ""productive"" and, lastly, possibly provide better health so that they would live longer to buy more gadgets and ""consume"" more ""content""?<p>If engineers are so smart, powerful and essential, why not inspire them to find ways to alleviate poverty and promote justice, education and equality? Well, you say, this is not a job for engineers. Well, if engineers are expected to think of new ways to book sleeping arrangements or sell clothes, their insight can surely be turned to loftier goals. I don't want to be caught saying anything positive about Facebook, but for better or worse, they have changed the way people around the world communicate with each other, compete with each other, and see themselves as part of society. So, yes, engineers are certainly capable of achieving some great feats.<p>Many lawyers make lots of money. Lots. And probably many of them became lawyers for that purpose. But It's hard for me to imagine - and maybe I'm wrong about this - but it's hard for me to imagine a well known lawyer delivering a keynote speech at a lawyers convention, where his main points are tips for making lots of money. Lawyers may be hypocritical (and they are), but at least many of them separate their business goals from their sources of inspiration. So why should engineers be inspired only by business tips? Is money the main source of inspiration for us? Doctors and lawyers make money, too, but they aspire for - or, at least, are inspired by - more. Even writers, directors and actors aspire for more than making money, or even ""delivering content"" or providing entertainment. They dream that, perhaps, some of their work might carry some Truth. Give people a new perspective about life, maybe even change people's lives - but not by making them simply more ""productive"". Peh, productivity - if there ever was a more overrated and servile word.<p>Anyway, we should aspire to do the same. Fellow engineers, do whatever makes you feel good about yourselves. Do whatever you need to make lots and lots and lots - piles - of money. By all means, solve people's annoying problems; that's a great advice. But don't aspire to that. You should dream about solving <i>humanity's serious problems</i>. You should dream of making this a truly better world - in every respect.",1331333116

Even if the server was in another country, it would be slightly more complicated to set up, but I'm sure local law enforcement would cooperate.<p>Despite all that, their ""correlation attack"" was distinctly low-tech. They watched the traffic leaving his residence and confirmed with a confidential informant logged into the chat server that he was online. It just shows that despite all the paranoia of the crypto-nerd crowd, even the second most sophisticated government agency in the world (perhaps after the NSA), pursuing a high value target, still can't or doesn't want to perform those kinds of attacks (maybe because they aren't reliable enough to hold up in a court of law).<p>And the CCC was claiming that they could fingerprint encrypted connections with 40% reliability.

There are many reasons why this has happened, but the major outcomes are that:<p>-Publication pressure makes it such that research progress has become significantly harder to gauge (e.g.: it's become uncommon for results to get reproduced) across many fields (statistics, machine learning, the health sciences, which I've done work in for over 7 years at a highly respected institution)<p>-Balkanization of research fields where problems become increasingly exotic and narrowly focused to the point of being contrived (all the better for publishing papers of course)<p>-Increased difficulties in securing research funding or employment (more temp jobs though);<p>-Arbitrary metrics often being used to judge one's work. Example: if you do theoretical work, reviewers can reject your paper for lack of ""applications""; if you do applied work, they can reject for ""lack of theoretical depth"" (what either of these terms mean in 90% of cases is arbitraily defined by a single reviewer who just wanted to torpedo your work).<p>-In some fields, entire mafia groups have formed that rigidly control the review process for that field, which means good luck to you if your work competes with theirs and you're submitting a paper/applying for grants<p>-Lack of accountability as to how research dollars are spent (vis-a-vis the public's interests)<p>-...<p>BTW, I say the above as someone who did a lot of enjoyable open-ended research as a grad student.",1331330918

I like it because it helps keep code completely out of the html templates, which is a design goal of lift.  I tend to work with designers who do HTML/CSS only, not javascript, and I do the backend Scala and frontend Javascript, so that separation of roles works.  But if your dev team (as most big ones do) consists of frontend HMTL/CSS designers, frontend Javascript UX devs, and backend devs, then that architecture may not be optimal.<p><i>> I also think Lift is dead.</i><p>Far from it.<p><i>> The creator of the project left</i><p>Not exactly:<p>1.

Even holds personal office hours every week in San Francisco to support Lift devs, for free.  He's just not doing direct commercial consulting on Lift anymore, others have grabbed that torch and are running with it, primarily in SF, London, and India.<p><i>> the documentation isn't great,</i><p>True, but improving.  The new book from Manning, <i>Lift In Action</i> [8] is excellent.  You can buy it from Manning, or obtain it by other means.  There are completely free options as well [9].<p><i>> View first model isn't popular</i><p>Popular is not necessarily better [10], unfortunately.  However, if you grok view first and still believe MVC is better, Lift also includes an MVC version [11] for you.<p><i>> very little activity in #lift,</i><p>The meat of the discussion is on the google group [2], not Twitter.  (And it's #liftweb anyway, but admittedly not much difference there either).<p><i>> very little activity in the lift framework google group.</i><p>Maybe you're comparing to a mega project like Rails, or maybe you accidentally mistook the stickies at the top for the actual group activity, but there's more than 'very little activity' in the group.<p>Granted, Lift isn't without issues.  Getting started via Maven is painful (Pro-tip: use SBT + Lifty [12]).  It has a non-trivial learning curve (I actually had to learn Haskell in order to grok Scala in order to use Lift - all worth it - though people coming from the ML family may have an easier ramp-up);  has to deal with Scala's versioning and dependency issues (which David Pollack ticked off the Scala community by vocally complaining about, and which SBT does a decent job of mitigating), and does most things differently than the norm.<p>However, it's a superb piece of technology more than worth the effort to learn.  It's more inherently secure than any other framework out there, enables a simple architecture (3-tier only, web/app/db, no caching layers), is relatively easily scalable (just add more instances to whichever layer you need to scale), does Ajax and Comet better than anything else, is very productive once you know it (minimal code, no testing necessary for classes of errors the type system or compiler catch), and lots of other excellent stuff [13].<p>It's evolving, maybe not at the pace of Rails, but it's starting with a far stronger technical architecture, runtime, and Java ecosystem interopability.<p>-----------------------<p>1.  <a href=""http://liftweb.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://liftweb.com/</a><p>2.  <a href=""http://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/liftweb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/liftweb</a><p>3.  <a href=""http://assembla.com/wiki/show/liftweb/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://assembla.com/wiki/show/liftweb/</a><p>4.  <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Exploring-Composition-and-Functional-Systems-in-the-Cloud"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Exploring-Composition-and...</a><p>5.  <a href=""http://lift.la/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lift.la/</a><p>6.  <a href=""http://goodstuff.im/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goodstuff.im/</a><p>7.  <a href=""http://visi.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://visi.io/</a> (see comments on Lift)<p>8.  <a href=""http://manning.com/perrett/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://manning.com/perrett/</a><p>9.  <a href=""http://www.assembla.com/spaces/liftweb/wiki/Resources"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.assembla.com/spaces/liftweb/wiki/Resources</a>;  <a href=""http://richard.dallaway.com/lift-cookbook-an-introduction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://richard.dallaway.com/lift-cookbook-an-introduction</a><p>10. <a href=""https://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/liftweb/View_First"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/liftweb/View_First</a><p>11. <a href=""http://www.assembla.com/spaces/liftweb/wiki/MVC_(if_you_really_want_it)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.assembla.com/spaces/liftweb/wiki/MVC_(if_you_real...</a><p>12.  <a href=""https://github.com/harrah/xsbt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/harrah/xsbt</a>; <a href=""https://github.com/Lifty/lifty"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Lifty/lifty</a><p>13. <a href=""http://seventhings.liftweb.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seventhings.liftweb.net/</a>",1331330885

(I'm a little perplexed because if the first copies weren't produced, that would obviate the willingness of people to buy copies in the first place.) You're saying, I think, that some art may never be: and this is because the artist is not convinced that they can make it profitable, and this is because they  see their audience as too far predisposed to pirating their content to actually pay for it.<p>If that's right, then it's true that I'm not really handling that problem with my original analogy -- I wouldn't even really classify this as a ""free rider"" problem per se.<p>One question which I'd like to ask up-front is whether this is really a problem. I'm not so sure. If you think about it, it requires a really peculiar set of circumstances. One particular problem is that if you didn't have piracy, that doesn't mean that the pirates would be your customers. So you are very restricted in price range: you have to be unable to amortize the costs of the project normally, but you have to be so addictive that pirates <i>would</i> be your customers and you <i>could</i> amortize the costs of the project if piracy weren't a factor. I'm not saying it's impossible, I'm just saying that the more I think about it, the harder it is to come up with a clear example that I can use to think through to find a solution. (Maybe I'm peculiar, but that's the way I think about problems: I call particular instances to mind and throw lots of ideas against them hoping one of them sticks as a solution. I'm having trouble seeing a particular instance which wouldn't already be solved by, say, Kickstarter or the BBC.)<p>Well, thanks. It's interesting to think about in any case. I guess I'd just end on a hopeful note: hopefully the production costs for art steadily drop down as well, as more and more technology becomes cheaper. There will be human-professional costs that cannot go down because people have got to eat, but they just don't seem like the most significant costs in producing art -- at the very least, bands haven't stopped living off of live shows yet, and theaters can still cover their actors and set staff with simple ticketing. I will also make the hopeful comment that people really do care about authenticity enough to support artists. That's why fashion design can still be lucrative even though there's a huge industry dedicated to knock-offs.",1331330851

3686175,comment,3685813,3685813,1,0,zred,,,"The key is figuring out when technology gets to a certain point that make a vision possible and which technologies will make it possible.  When Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007, there had been touchscreen phones for a long time.  Apple identified that capacitive touchscreens were a new technology that allowed for a touch device to work much better - better to the extent that it changed whether touch devices would be generally accepted or not.  They didn't invent capacitive touchscreens nor touch-phones.  They did recognize how that technology changed one's ability to make good touch devices.  At the time, Windows Mobile didn't even support capacitive touchscreens.<p>Likewise, with the iPhone and iPad, Apple designed the interface differently.  I remember Windows Mobile phones that had menus much like desktop operating systems (<a href=""http://pdadb.net/imageview.php?path=img/os/ppc_5.0/wm5_vga_phone_start_menu.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pdadb.net/imageview.php?path=img/os/ppc_5.0/wm5_vga_p...</a>).  When you look over Apple's guidelines for iOS apps, you can see how they took into consideration the size of touch targets and how the user would interact with the device much more than previous touch devices.<p>The idea of a tablet computer has been around for a long while.  Microsoft and its partners had created Windows tablets that worked like the desktop OS for a while.  As others have pointed out, Star Trek and other TV programs have shown us tablet computers.  What Apple brought to the table was how to make that technology compelling for people as the components to make something compelling all come into being.<p>ARM processors combined the needed processing power with lower power consumption meaning that the iPad could be 2 pounds or less with many hours of battery life.  If you had the idea of a Pentium powered tablet in the 90s with 10 hours of battery life and a 2 pound weight, it would just be an idea.  Before capacitive touchscreens, it wouldn't be a compelling experience.  You can have the idea that the touchscreen would be accurate and nice to use, but identifying how to achieve that is important.  While Apple's UI concepts are something we're used to today, Windows Mobile and BlackBerry was the order of the day for mobile devices back then.  While one can have the idea that the tablet should be intuitive to use, actually managing that can take work.<p>There's a reason why one never really understands what they're doing with the computer on Star Trek.  It can be hard to create a really compelling product that's actually great to use.  It isn't merely the concept of ""a light, powerful tablet with little weight and a great user experience"" that makes it happen.  One has to identify what can be brought together to accomplish it as well as design a compelling interaction.",1331330491

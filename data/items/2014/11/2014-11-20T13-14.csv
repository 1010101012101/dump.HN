I&#x27;d like to have &quot;just an IDE&quot;, for node and web development.<p>Sorry to reply on a tangent, but for that sort of development I feel compelled to chip in and recommend WebStorm. It&#x27;s not free, but ships with a boatload of features that are perfect for NodeJS/WebDev. Like a reverse-debugger that you can use on your serverside as well as front-end code.

Just like <i>any</i> other court order.

8635658,comment,8633683,8634063,0,0,thehammer,,,"&quot;The press is our shield against all the evil that is done against the public by governments and corporations.&quot;<p>This seems incredibly naive to me. It&#x27;s certainly idealistic, and it&#x27;s extremely difficult to believe that the media, at least the American media, isn&#x27;t heavily biased by capitalism. Sensationalism does more harm than good, and it&#x27;s trivial to 
&quot;buy&quot; press coverage. The New York Times may very well have enough integrity to refuse to be bought, but it&#x27;s a common practice to solicit journalists to write articles about new products and such. If you have an agenda, there are journalists ready to be paid to support it. Not only is the press sometimes not our shield, sometimes they&#x27;re actually a sword against us.<p>While Travis&#x27; comments were certainly regrettable, there&#x27;s an important distinction between talking about doing something and actually doing it. Almost anytime someone is called out for something they&#x27;ve said, the comments are taken out of context. It&#x27;s easy for me to imagine that what was said was a reaction to a journalist behaving badly, writing an article with an agenda. It seems likely that the suggestion to use trip data was a suggestion to stoop to the same level, rather than simply to be evil towards someone who was noble and with unquestionable integrity. Uber gets a lot of press, and while some fair points are made, the press I&#x27;ve seen tends to be overly aggressive, misinformed, and usually displaying a clear agenda. What Uber is doing is revolutionary, disrupting well entrenched business models. When you disrupt an industry, you make enemies of the people who were lazily profiting from it. That doesn&#x27;t mean Uber is good and their opponents are evil. But make no mistake that there is a battle going on, and ugly things are being said on both sides. We&#x27;re all a bunch of idiots if we waste time letting ourselves be drawn in by someone else&#x27;s agenda rather than assessing the merits of each side independently and voting with our wallets.",1416491574

And while it helps decrease load by tying up commands, it still indicates you have a bottleneck that is going to overflow at increased load; if users start refreshing the page because it&#x27;s loading slowly, or if you have an influx of users, you can still overflow, and adding queues isn&#x27;t going to fix that, just make it last a little longer before it falls over again.

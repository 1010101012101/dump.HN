You can find PDFs for all sorts of new books if you know where to look -- not everything, yet, but a lot. Amazon has as good a search interface as any library&#x27;s DOS terminal I&#x27;ve ever used (I&#x27;d argue much better). All the fascinating facts, stories, and amazing information are on the web, too, along with a bunch of other stuff. I&#x27;d say the author just needs to refine his webcrawling.<p>[1] <a href=""http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/07/universalism-postwar-progressivism-as.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/07/univers...</a>",1418007515

8714686,comment,8714239,8714239,0,0,pastProlog,,,"She seems to be mixing apples and oranges.  She talks about occupying classrooms and being in militant demonstrations and says she&#x27;s now all grown up and doesn&#x27;t do that now.  This is very normal - young people are impatient, passionate, tempestuous, etc.  Older organizers generally are not doing that stuff as much.<p>Then she associates this with changes in political positions.  This is something else, it may be connected for people like her, but not others.  There are plenty of people in their fifties with &quot;radical&quot; positions who are writing essays, organizing voter drives, walking picket lines, volunteering at a community radio station and so forth.  They are in it for the long haul, and usually getting more done.  Going to a demonstration and yelling at a cop might give someone an adrenaline rush.  However, long-term efforts to work with others on seemingly minor changes to attain a broader goal is usually what gets more done.<p>She seems to think there is some connection between wanting the NDP elected, or for US cabinet officials to not be former Wall Street CEOs, to young people ranting and raving in the street.  There isn&#x27;t.  She has little to say about the left - she was not part of it, then she became a Fox News caricature of what an organizer is (scratch that, she probably thought of herself as an &quot;activist&quot;, not an organizer), then is unhappy and renounces it all.  She was never really on the left at all.  They&#x27;re really scraping the bottom of the barrel for this &quot;God that failed&quot; stuff nowadays.  &quot;I was a teenage agitator&quot;",1418007489

A turbocharger is actually considered a type of supercharger.

When I was first exposed to it (in 1989, even before the World Wide Web was a thing) it blew my mind. My first thought was that this is going to be as powerful as the invention of the wheel. This incredible tool, as might be expected when understanding it&#x27;s immense scope and potential, has over the years become more and more a mirror of the civilisation that uses it. This of course  causes it to include unbelievably huge doses of shit (content which is shallow, stupid, ignorant, petty, immoral, illegal etc.), but also gives us access to an unparalleled abundance of deep, interesting, educational, inspiring and fascinating stuff on any topic at unbelievable speed.<p>Of course you might still find things in libraries that you can&#x27;t find on the Internet but what I know is that today I can find in seconds what would have taken me days to find once in a library (and this is assuming the library even had enough information on the specific topic I&#x27;m interested in). There are things I can (and do) find today and people I can contact with a quick search which I never could have found or known to exist in the &quot;library only&quot; era.

Roughly 700 MB.<p>That means the first challenge is actually getting the thing to me. For a while i had two options: Either i could go out into the store, and buy it there (spending 2 hours + cash), or if they didn&#x27;t have it, order it and come back later (another 2 hours). Or i could torrent it at home, spending no cash and 2 hours waiting for the download to complete while i do other things; and live with the possible risk of a letter from my ISP.<p>So now i have the thing. The next challenge is to get it on the computer and running. With the store-bought medium i have to hope that it is physically sound, and i need to ensure it stays that way; I also have to hope that my drive is compatible with their copy protection; and to add insult to injury, i need to keep the disc in my drive to play it, meaning i have to handle the things a lot, and have my drive uselessly make noise. With the torrent, i unpack it and install it, maybe needing to spend an extra 5 minutes to find the right crack; and live with the risk of contracting malware.<p>And the last issue: Software updates. This time the two options are almost the same: Find the latest update, download and install it. Torrent updates come with a risk of malware again.<p>Now, when i was young specifically the first and second thing led me to pirate most of the games i got. Not because i didn&#x27;t want to spend the cash; but because i didn&#x27;t want to spend cash, just to have to spend my own time to get the thing and live with the constant annoyance of keeping the right disc in my drive, constantly rotating.<p>This is especially borne out in current times. Steam is now here and while the prices are similar to physical game sales (the value of my steam library is estimated at $7000), i gladly and happily spend the money for it, since Steam solves these problems:<p>1. Games are downloadable.<p>2. The copy protection is either my online status, or a specific steam token. (In practice i&#x27;ve never not been able to access the games.)<p>3. Updates come automatically.<p>4. As long as Steam doesn&#x27;t crash and burn, i&#x27;ll be able to access the things i bought in perpetuity without needing to cat herd a gaggle of physical storages.<p>The &quot;culture of free&quot; doesn&#x27;t revolve around free. There is a cost in any &quot;free&quot;. Usually the risk of legal action or malware.<p>The &quot;culture of free&quot; is winning because people hoping to make money fail to provide solutions that actually address customers&#x27; needs.

This turns out to be called samplesort, with some extra detail regarding picking the buckets.<p>However, once you give up on in-place you should probably use radix sort instead, as long as your elements, or their hashes, have some semblance of uniform distribution: this avoids having to calculate greater-than on a large number of pivots, although depending on the architecture it may be possible to do the latter reasonably quickly, and I suppose you may end up saturating memory bandwidth anyway...<p>Anyway, you can run a single partition in parallel - just not in place - by dividing the input data and having separate output queues per core.  You probably need to merge the buckets back into the original array anyway, so this doesn&#x27;t hurt; even if you want to keep the buckets separated (but individually contiguous) for some reason, e.g. if you don&#x27;t need the final output as an array and want to save some difficult-to-parallelize merging, it just makes the partition a bit trickier with some atomic stuff.",1418006362

From the outset, the west was intensely hostile to communism and placed it under perpetual threat of military defeat. This was true from the early invasion of the newly declared USSR by WWI allied governments, to the runup to and ultimate defeat of Nazism by the Soviet Union, to the Cold war, to the western backing of the Nationalist government in China, to Eisenhower&#x27;s threats of catastrophic nuclear retaliation against China during the 1950s. In every case, it was absolutely imperative that the communist governments industrialize as rapidly and as thoroughly as possible, costs be damned. In the USSR, the wisdom of the industrialization policy was proven by the defeat of fascism in 1945; but throwing every possible hour of labor into industrialization meant that other aspects of the economy were neglected and catastrophic mistakes like the famine in Ukraine could occur. The exact same motivation and consequence were what caused the Great Leap Forward and the famine associated with it.&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>Note that this is very different than the famines we know about that were actually engineered by a government, such as, to pick just one example, the Bengal Famine of 1943  (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_famine_of_1943"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_famine_of_1943</a>)",1418006235

In short, you&#x27;re not a creator that&#x27;s free-lancing, you&#x27;re a creator for hire, and the results don&#x27;t belong to you - they belong to the financing body, which in that case, is the public at large.<p>A better solution is just to funnel money in to sciences through public funding mechanisms and telling you that the papers and results - free, and readily accessible to the public - are the deliverable we expect for that money.<p>Let me ask you this: why do you think you need to get money from the paper or results when as a scientist, you&#x27;re already being paid for your work through other channels?",1418004848

Why not start out by teaching assembler? Especially post 32bit x86, assembler (intel syntax) is rather pleasant. It allows highlighting lots of things that are commonly hidden in C: calling conventions, different types of strings (eg: C vs Pascal) etc.<p>C is obviously very useful as a &quot;real-world&quot; language. If you need to add a driver you need to Linux, or patch a bug in your shell (or shell utility) etc -- knowing at least enough C to be dangerous can be very helpful. You&#x27;ll likely be able to put C to good use re-implementing critical sections of python/ruby/whatever code. But IMNHO C still remains a rather awful language.<p>For some reason, I feel that pointers are easy in Pascal (and assembler) and hard to grasp in C -- as far as I can tell this is entirely a syntactical issue for me.<p>In the future (post rust 1.0), perhaps I&#x27;d recommend assembler, rust and some other high-level language (or two...). I find it hard to recommend Pascal -- while compilers exist, it is a little too much of a &quot;teaching language&quot; -- and a little too far on the outside of everything. Ada might be an interesting option.<p>Perhaps assembler > C > python. Or assembler > SBCL (Steel bank common lisp) -- because it integrates well with assembler, allowing the user to easily &quot;peek under the covers&quot;.<p>C is awfully low level -- and yet also surprisingly high-level. There&#x27;s no sane, canonical way to handle text (that is utf8/unicode -- not merely ascii). I&#x27;m not entirely sure C++ is <i>much</i> better in this regard, but I still think Storstroup&#x27;s contrast between &quot;beginner C&quot; and &quot;beginner C++&quot; from 1998 is interesting[1]. I&#x27;d be curious what kind of production level code a beginning C programmer produces, and for what kind of problems.<p>Fundamentally though, I&#x27;m not sure there is a good &quot;one way fits all&quot;. A lot of people will be served fine with only Python or Ruby (or Julia). Thinking too much about how the computer works can also be a hindrance, I think. Getting actual work done, does seem to hinge on joining together proven, useful tools. Be that tool Berkley DB, SQlite, Postgres, levledb, Riak, redis -- or text files (for example). Or protobuf or json or xml. Etc.<p>At any rate, I fail to see, from the point of &quot;understanding how the computer works&quot; -- it helps very much to learn (just) C. Without assembler, I think most of the useful lessons are lost -- and I&#x27;m not convinced the number of lesson most obvious in C -- but not covered by assembler on one end, and a high level language on the other -- are that many?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.stroustrup.com/new_learning.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stroustrup.com/new_learning.pdf</a>",1418004788

My belief based on the understanding of the runtime is that this is all a static check at runtime (i.e., taking the type of the value, looking that type&#x27;s info up, and then reading from that type whether it implements a given interface, with all calculation done at compile time and only the lookup being done dynamically), and that while that number may go up a bit if there are more interfaces in play it shouldn&#x27;t go up much.<p>DoNothingInterfaceCall is the time to call a function that does nothing and returns nothing through the interface. I tried adding a benchmark time for a do-nothing static call but Go inlines it away into nothing, making it a useless test of how fast the loop itself is running. 0.89 ns, FWIW.<p>InterfaceUpgradeAndCall combines the upgrade check and call into one pass. InterfaceUpgradeFail just checks to see if the fail case times very differently (no).<p>It&#x27;s fairly easy to tweak these if you&#x27;d like to ask different questions. (Note some of the tests have a bit of spurious stuff at the end to make it so Go doesn&#x27;t complain about unused values. Go really doesn&#x27;t like to see unused values.)<p>Also, for those who may have spent some time benchmarking the more dynamic languages, I call your attention to the &quot;ns&quot; there. That&#x27;s not milli- or microseconds, that&#x27;s nanoseconds. (I once benchmarked something between Go and Erlang, and mistakingly though the Go was slower when it took 700 and Erlang was taking 70, but it turned out to be nanoseconds and microseconds respectively. FWIW, the code wasn&#x27;t doing exactly the same thing, either, it was just some code I was benchmarking at the time, and it is expected that the Go code was doing less; point being, watch your units.)<p><a href=""http://play.golang.org/p/K1LedMxMPL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://play.golang.org/p/K1LedMxMPL</a>",1418004599

I&#x27;m interested in seeing if anybody else has run into these things happening to them, as well.<p>Coming from a background in CS, you have a definite advantage. There are a lot of tech companies out here, but I would not limit myself to that if I were you. There are plenty of opportunities where tech is an overlap with the actual focus of a company. Try not to get stuck in a particular mindset about what job you&#x27;ll do, especially if you are just finishing your PhD and stepping into the &quot;real world&quot;.<p>The Valley (I&#x27;m including all of the SF Bay Area, as well), is a great place, with a lot to offer. However, it can be a hard and cold place, especially if you don&#x27;t know anybody out here.<p>Unless you&#x27;re traveling along El Camino Real, or going into the center of cities, traveling is a pain. Services such as the Caltrain have limited stops at certain locations, and stop running at 10:30pm or midnight (depending on the direction). Muni can be packed and pass by usual stops if there isn&#x27;t enough room (ususally will only happen around Chinatown and Northbeach areas). And BART is... a topic for another day.<p>This has given rise to Uber and Lyft providing a great convenience, but one in which you pay for. Sometimes having excessive multipliers on the usual fare you&#x27;re charged. Taking an Uber in SF during a Giant&#x27;s game day will see a spike in fare, for example.<p>The culture is its own thing. Having lived in Chicago and NYC, I&#x27;ve had my share of interaction with enough people. People in the valley are very friendly and very helpful—up front. Rather than not talking to you, or brushing you off, people will act very excited to meet you and talk with you. However, do not take this as them having an actual interest in you, or anything about you. This lone difference had made it difficult for me to actually understand who is a friend, and who is not out here.<p>Related to that, the dating scene out here is the same, from my experience. A lot of girls I&#x27;ve dated out here are looking for a guy who has a particular &quot;thing&quot;. Whether that be he teaches yoga, has a dog, does art in the park, something they can tell their friends about. In NYC my experience has been a bit better. Girls seemed to be more attracted to me based on my personality, and &quot;charm&quot; for lack of a better word. I didn&#x27;t feel the need to have a &quot;thing&quot; going on, just me being me.<p>Housing and where you live greatly alter your enjoyment. This also depends on what you want to do.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for night life, you should definitely live in SF, Palo Alto, or San Jose. Anywhere else limits you to particular metros, or how much money you&#x27;re willing to shell out for an Uber. There is a lot going on at any time in those 3 places, that finding groups, meetups, events, will be a great place to socialize.<p>Housing is expensive. Very expensive. But it&#x27;s not terrible. A lot of companies take into consideration housing, so your paycheck will reflect being able to afford to live.<p>Your paycheck might look like a lot at $120,000, but it&#x27;s not. Between rent, taxes, food, travel, you&#x27;ll be living well, but not as well as some might think.<p>It&#x27;s a good place to live, especially if you&#x27;re in your 20&#x27;s and want to further your career, and love technology. Outside of that, it&#x27;s just another place with its own quirks.",1418004498

Of course it&#x27;s better to install from repos and I don&#x27;t think anyone is wanting to replace repo-based package management with curl|bash. But like it or not, not all software is immediately available on every possible distro. Sometimes you will want to install software from upstream for one reason or another. And for that purpose upstreams need to provide independent installation mechanisms.<p>curl|bash complements package managers instead of replacing them.",1443189590

Didn&#x27;t work. The demo desk worked - but nothing else did. Also - didn&#x27;t I read something where .7 is not backwards compatible with apps compiled for .6?<p>> AMD drivers and the Rift&#x27;s extended mode stopped working together.<p>I find extended mode only works for me on my AMD card. And I think this is part of the problem - there appears to be a number of &quot;it works for me&quot;/&quot;it doesn&#x27;t work for me&quot; threads all over the Oculus Rift forum from people with varying builds including threads of &quot;if you follow this incantation and sacrifice a chicken while modifying your registry - this will make the Oculus Rift work&quot;<p>> Also, if you haven&#x27;t checked out the latest VR Desktop<p>I tried that out - but it crashed for me almost every time I tried using it.<p>For me the Oculus Rift has pretty much been a fail - I couldn&#x27;t tell if the fail has been on my end (ie my desktop) or Oculus Rift&#x27;s end. Though I really think if they hope to get a market share is to hire the guy(s) who has been working on JanusVR and make that a bundled &quot;app&quot;. Right now that is the only reason why I don&#x27;t just put it in a box and forget about it. Yes - I understand this is a &quot;development kit&quot; but I would like to know that it&#x27;s functional before I develop for it. If people have to read out of the Necronomicon to use it - there is no point in developing for it. I feel like others share this opinion because I think Elite Dangerous implemented support but said that they won&#x27;t update it until the Oculus Rift has a non-dev kit version.<p>I&#x27;m just frazzled because I purchased this $300 device expecting it to be somewhat stable - and it seems like something I would get out of a kickstarter.",1443189323

If they choose &quot;developers&quot;, then it will become a great tool that is fun to develop in, no doubt.<p>But as long as it remains in a limbo between &quot;end-users&quot; (the one&#x27;s browsing the site you are building), &quot;webmasters/editors&quot; (those managing the content and configuring tidbits) and &quot;developers&quot; this won&#x27;t happen.<p>There are just too many conflicting interests there. Real use case: can a webmaster change some settings in the image-cache? certainly not! Changing the width of an image will break all your carefully crafted CSS grids: it is tightly coupled to the Theme (which lives in Git and goes through a release-cycle).<p>If Drupal chose &quot;developers&quot;, a thing like &quot;imagecache&quot; won&#x27;t even exist in its current set-up. It won&#x27;t have a database to store its settings, nor a web-interface. Instead it would be an Image class that you can inherit and then define some settings and methods in order to get an image-derivative.<p>From what I&#x27;ve seen, Drupal 8 does not change this conceptual basis. So I highly doubt it is possible to develop sites when your basis is conflicting with what you want to do on such a crucial level.",1443189043

For a news distribution service, it does not matter so much I suspect, but in-general, the trend of putting more and more of the functionality I rely on daily into a web browser is distressing. Web browsers, despite all the innovation and work that has gone on lately, are still an enormous attack surface with the most significant likelihood of security breach (especially given that the rise of javascript has led us all to the point where we are almost allowing arbitrary code execution from untrusted sources on every page visit). Not to mention that web browsers were founded on the notion of conveying content, not functionality; HTML is a markup language (with <canvas> and JS and HTML frameworks, that&#x27;s not so concrete anymore), it was not meant to host alternatives to the power of native applications.<p>I often find myself wishing for the ability to use a text-based web browser and have &quot;The Web&quot; still work, but those days are mostly long-gone[1] till I finally get around to writing my own browser[2] (which seems like it should not be a necessary step just to be able to interact with a simpler Web).<p>I suppose I am just tilting at windmills at this point (and, as I said, this post is not really aimed at atavist since I think content-delivery is a perfect niche for being web-only).

I also realize that I&#x27;m not in a position to write anything, which relieves some pressure.<p>Unfortunately, &quot;not enough experience&quot; is not one of my common hangups.

Or maybe I&#x27;m a terrible writer and should give up.<p>And on and on and on goes the spinning top if self loathing.<p>To combat it, I do a few things. First I make sure the idea and the medium align. You wouldn&#x27;t want to write a blog post about the geo political tensions the Syrian refugee crisis has caused much like you wouldn&#x27;t want to write a book about your mom&#x27;s famous beef stroganoff recipe.<p>Once you feel they align, tell yourself you&#x27;re not a genius. Really, do it. What you&#x27;re about to write will be derivative and boring. It&#x27;s going to be the steamy turd you wish you never wrote.<p>Then polish the turd. Revise your writing the best you can. And finally have someone (with some sort of credentials) critique it. Or if you&#x27;re feeling daring, set it off in the wild.

It lowers the guarantees without reducing the burden. The more you rely on that lie being the truth in your code, the less useful the type system is in preventing bugs in your code.<p>`null` is a pervasive hole as every time you invoke a method on any object, you may actually be throwing a null pointer exception<p>Checking for null every time will help - now we have the guarantee back. However then we get to another hole which is caused by shared mutable state: if you check for nulls by the time you get to executing the method inside the block the reference may become null.<p>Luckily, this doesn&#x27;t pertain to code that doesn&#x27;t deal with shared mutable state, so this &quot;unsoundness&quot; is less &quot;bad&quot; i.e. more avoidable than the previous one. However in the presence of concurrency, immutability or the inability to share mutable state become another useful constraint.<p>So its simply a question of how much potential certain lie has to cause problems in your particular code or domain. For example, the answer for `null` is pretty much &quot;most code&quot;. The answer for &quot;bivariant function types in TypeScript&quot; is &quot;a lot less, but here are cases X Y and Z and they are common in our code, and here is how to avoid it..&quot;<p>But yes, I agree that its not a binary unsound vs sound. And I do prefer type systems where I can say &quot;trust me, this results with the type I say it will&quot; when its not possible to express it otherwise.

It&#x27;s often not just Debian-like or RPM based, it&#x27;s something like Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit only. If you are already doing that, you already bought into the OS. Support it properly.<p>RPM is not my favorite format. I much prefer Debian-based distros specifically because dpkg and apt are so robust. I have never had a problem with managing configuration files there. You either provide a sane default config, put a config in /usr/share/doc/your-package/, or provide a configuration utility. All that works just fine.<p>And you absolutely should use the system&#x27;s packages for your dependencies. When you install your own copy of MySQL, nginx, or anything else, you assume responsibility for all upgrades to those subsystems. If next week MySQL releases a patch for remote code execution vulnerability, I want that patched right away. My OS&#x27;s package manager will do that. Will your custom installer?<p>If you must, break up your installer into two pieces. First, use a simple Makefile-like setup (avoid autotools though), with generic targets like build, install, clean, dist-clean. Then wrap that in a .deb and .rpm. This way you can distribute system packages that cover 90% of the use cases, and a signed self-contained tarball for the 10% of people who for whatever reason cannot use your pre-build packages.<p>As an empirical point, hundreds of thousands of pieces of mature software get by with using RPM. Why is your project suddenly such a snowflake that it cannot fit that paradigm. Perhaps the people who develop apt/rpm/homebrew/whatever have thought of the problems you might have and already provided the tools for you to solve them so you don&#x27;t have to write custom installers, upgrade scripts, migration scripts, dependency management scripts, etc. yourself.",1443187003

They take their car, take off the seatbelt, and drive as fast as they can and hit an oncoming heavy goods vehicle. That&#x27;s bad, because it is very traumatic to the people who drive trucks and transport stuff. They get injured physically, and even worse, emotionally. You can&#x27;t stop this by making better cars; you might stop it by having only Google-driven robot cars (so we go merry round with the discussion on how evil corporations are). And even then, if people can&#x27;t kill themselves with a car, they&#x27;ll find something else. Next, you&#x27;ll be banning pedestrian bridges.<p>Over one tenth of traffic deaths here are natural deaths. I.e. they are recorded in traffic death statistics, and they are used for justifying car and fuel taxes, but in fact it&#x27;s the old man got a heart attack or a stroke, and died, and there&#x27;s not a scratch to the car. Or just fell off the road on his bike. But it&#x27;s still a traffic death here.<p>Then there are the tragic accidents where a child is run over by a heavy goods vehicle. Most of this is not about speed; it&#x27;s about noticing people who were in a blind spot. We&#x27;ve had three children killed in an few weeks in this nation in similar accidents, and that is too much. Here, some automatic detection technology will probably help a bit.<p>But what&#x27;s the bulk of traffic accidents? Mostly it&#x27;s tremendous idiocy which is hard to legislate away. People who are DUI at four times the legal limit, are driving three times the speed limit, and running away from police because they don&#x27;t have a driver&#x27;s license, and they have no seat belts, and then they hit a tree and everyone in the car is killed.<p>More survivable vehicles help, and in fact the development has been huge over the past years, but particularly the people who are gross idiots are also people who drive older cars, so they are less protected.<p>And still, considering all this, I think road traffic is remarkably safe, and when I think how much people move around, accidents are few and far between.",1443186085

However, once Sandstorm reaches a stable release, we fully intend to offer more traditional packaging choices as well. We still have lots of work to do!<p>This sounds like a cop-out. Packaging an RPM and a DEB will take care of most distros, and the distro maintainers should do the rest.<p>Your build system should be creating the requisite package files.<p>If not, there&#x27;s always OpenSuse Build Service.",1443186065

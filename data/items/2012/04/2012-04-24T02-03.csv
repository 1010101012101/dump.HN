As we're nearing a release date and more important decisions are needing to be made, we're starting the discussion of whether to establish a Partnership, LLC, or Inc. We're all in mutual trust with each other, so dishonesty is not a primary concern.<p>From my understanding a partnership is simpler to establish but there's personal liability. An LLC's biggest disadvantage is that it can't go public. Inc sounds like it has a lot of hoops to jump through.<p>Given the nature of this community, I figured I might glean some unique insight.

Plus, many times these distinctions don't even exist in your native language, and it is very hard to even realize they are there in recordings, because you're not used to listening for them.<p>Learning the IPA pronunciations forces you to become aware of every sound in the language, and distinguish between different sounds in different words that you might otherwise go for years without detecting.

There are an infinite number of ways to implement something, and I find it to be increasingly common that the most complicated implementations seems to be preferred. It seems once someone learns some design patterns, from that point forward they are <i>determined</i> to use them.<p>Rare is the programmer in the ""enterprise"" world who will acknowledge the fact that there are multiple ways, of varying complexity, to implement something.<p>A good example in my opinion of two sides of this argument, both sides far more qualified than me, was when Robert Martin (Uncle Bob) was on the StackOverflow podcast to discuss some of the issues (attacks) Joel had made on Bob's advocacy of SOLID principles, test coverage, etc.  <i>My</i> take on the discussion was that Joel was genuinely trying to understand why Bob considered the complexity of his advocated designs absolutely critical to developing software, and without it, you will fail (or should be fired).  However, his argument was unconvincing to me.  If these principles are so important, then why can't you make a compelling argument for them that experienced practitioners can understand?  And again, if they <i>are</i> so important that you ignore them at your own peril, how is so much software written successfully while ignoring these principles.<p>I think that side of the camp would do a big favor to itself by becoming a little humbler and intellectually honest.",1335234444

I also think that you will see more convenient on-screen navigation between apps and linking from app to app.<p>Ultimately because of their origins in the early static web, HTML5/CSS/JavaScript etc. are not the ideal platform for applications and so I think that directly coding that layer will fall out of fashion and instead it will become a base layer that other frameworks output.<p>I believe that the .NET-, Objective-C- and Java-based languages/platforms have dated core characteristics that make them disadvantageous as well as the problem of requiring extra coding.  So even if people aren't developing mobile apps on HTML5 or HTML5-based platforms they are likely to move towards using some other layer above the native based on the economics alone.<p>Its difficult to predict what will happen for sure though.  Personally, if I had my way, a lot of the current stack would be dropped immediately.  CSS would be first to go.  The concept of coding markup directly would be dropped.  Instead, interactive tools would be used for creating and maintaining UIs and other application structures.  Those tools would exchange data in the simplest possible common formats that could be agreed upon.  The common formats across tools would extend to include semantic descriptions of components above the implementation level.  ASCII source code would fall out of favor and be replaced with more interactive structural and semantic application editors.  HTTP, the web, and the traditional client-server would be dropped and replaced with content-oriented networking integrated with the common application and data exchange formats.

Android already has a mechanism for dealing with accounts and they are already populated with Facebook, Twitter, Google, Skype, LinkedIn, Dropbox etc.  You can add your app too if you want to be a provider of authentication/authorization for your service.

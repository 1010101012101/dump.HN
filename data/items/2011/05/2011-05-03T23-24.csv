But, ""long"" is relative, mostly based on what we expect.  I.e. now we believe living 80 years is a long time, whereas centuries ago 40 may have seemed a long time.<p>What I'm saying is that surviving until heat death may seem long now, but that's only because it is currently impossible.  Such ""immortality"" may seem very short if we could actually do it.<p>A similar situation is people who always complain they don't have enough money no matter how much they make.",1304467188

Did you indicate to BOTH colleges that you accepted the offer of admission? Or is there something else going on here?<p>Back to answering your question. It is my general observation of young people who have faced the question you face--attending MIT or attending the low-list-price state university--that the persons who attend MIT end up being happy that they did so, and no worse off (arguably, better off) financially for having done so. What I hear about such persons is that they gain so many more, and so much more lucrative, career opportunities because of matriculating at MIT that the higher out-of-pocket costs is more than made up for. And what everyone who applies to MIT really seeks there, I think, is a community of a bunch of learners who can learn rapidly, deeply, and avidly for four years together with an amazing group of peers.<p>That said, I largely agree with pg's point in his essay ""News from the Front""<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/colleges.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/colleges.html</a><p>that it ""may not matter all that much where you go to college.""

The banality of some subjects gain from the filters, even if they're canned.

Anyway, the user facing product might have sucked, but we did scale (that's why friendster was friendster and we were myspace :). In an environment with 450+ million users, we had extensive caching systems and still had to use every sql trick in the book to get our systems to scale well. I know because my job was working with the DBAs to bridge the sql and front end worlds together. I can say with great certainty that front end developers who did not know sql and were simply following a logical object model would not have produced code that scaled in our environment, there were way too many things that were done that were extremely non-obvious. Since myspace i've been working at a python/postgres start up where we've been applying the same principles pretty successfully, at a much different scale of course. If nothing else, i think the no orm approach will at least give you more bang for your buck.<p>Separating your data access code out of the application logic also allows you to change it much more easily as data conditions change, including on the fly, without an application deployment. That's often extremely useful.<p>MySpace scale may be at an extreme end of the spectrum, but we had formidable hardware to throw at it too (although x86, so nothing TOO crazy). So I think the ratio of hardware to scale at other sites is comparable, and so I think the same lessons apply. I have no experience working with oracle, but would you say that a 7 node oracle cluster is some pretty serious hardware? I myself really don't know, but it is a question I have :).<p>EDIT: I'm not discounting your experience, i just want to point out that i've experienced conditions where I think the orm approach would have broken down. If others have had different experiences, the more data points the better, but i think the scale/complexity/cost(hw) ratios play into the debate as well.<p>EDIT #2: Oh and I forgot to mention that the automated test suite you had is an incredible asset, and no doubt made it easier to discover problems early and deal with them effectively.

The answer need not present a direct solution to the problem I will discuss shortly; a story from personal experience or words of advise/wisdom would suffice. I thank you for taking your time to elucidate a matter we are greatly troubled by, it means a lot!<p>I am a senior in high school. More particularly, I am a self-motivated computer science kid who got accepted into 2 colleges/universities, MIT and Poly. I love working on projects while learning TCS. You would find me spending a weekday afternoon hacking away on a realtime video converter leveraging NodeJS and Go, later to catch me reading an episode of Achilles and the Tortoise from GEB (with the occasional (frequent) refreshes of HN in-between the chapters).<p>Now that you know a little about me, let us shift focus to the elephant in the room: tuition. More particularly, cost of education vs. its worth.<p>MIT - $120k :: Well, it's MIT<p>Poly -  :: Decent polytechnic, decent education, more info on http://www.poly.edu/<p>To make a long story short, my parents are in a complicated financial situation (hence practically no financial aid from MIT and ineligibility to take private loans due to credit history) and can contribute $100k for my education at MIT (this is for all 4 undergrad years, after private loan from family member). Where/how can I come up with $40k a year?<p>Should I pursue Poly, I will have no financial weight on my shoulders.<p>From the various impressions I made from students and people regarding the value of MIT, I feel like it is worth the money. The motivated students I will find there, the crazy projects I will be working on, the top-quality education I will be receiving, all of these things <i>seem</i> to be worth the money. What do you think? Then again, there is the physical constraint of actually affording it (it would be great to receive some guidance on affordability as well, considering the fact that the government and school have nothing more to offer me in terms of financial accommodations).<p>Any comments greatly appreciated,<p>- Mark",1304464439

- Desktop backup and virtual drives to the cloud (jungle disk)
- Platform/application hosting
- All of the above on a single bill from a single provider and with private networking in between for free (for colocated services in the same DC)<p>As a slicehost customer you couldn't use any of those products, as a cloud customer you can. In addition you will have access to all of the new cloud products in development at Rackspace (whatever those may be, but use your imagination and I'm sure you can guess on likely candidates) as well as all the datacenter locations where Rackspace has active and growing footprints. To put it simply, you'll be switching into an active and growing product suite and I do believe that benefits you.<p>I personally would not consider it 'shutting down' Slicehost, but instead a merging of Slicehost into Cloud. It is true that the backend mechanics of the two products are essentially the same, and that's why you should not overly fear losing core functionality.<p>I don't think your comment comes across as rude at all and I completely understand your sentiment. All I can say (I and I think I'm repetitive to do so here again), is that I think Rackspace is doing the right thing here. From my perspective I'm breathing a sigh of relief because at least I know that all the still existing customers will finally start getting some TLC (via being on the actively developed product again).<p>I'm certain Rackspace wants the transition to be as painless as it can be and I'd expect quite a bit more detail to come out over the course of the year as this unfolds.",1304463700

So, prior to investing large amounts of grad student hours and resources into a particular experimental design (common rookie inclination), you do a pilot study.  Just collect 5-7 data points.<p>Just run it and see what happens.  Since you only spent a relatively small amount of time/resources on the pilot study, it's not a terrible waste if you get null/negative/inconclusive/uninterpretable results, and you could get a quick turnaround on the next iteration.  If you're lucky, you might get to estimate the number of data points you need to collect based on the variability in the sample.  It might tell you that this setup doesn't have a good signal to noise ratio.  You may need to go back and change your design.<p>Or you might find something completely unexpected, and find yourself asking a different question altogether, that you need to change your overall direction.  Your project proposal might have an elaborate tree of potential experiments that depend on the outcomes of each one before.  And you find something so different you need to redesign everything, armed with this new information.  That's a good thing.  Trust me.<p>Entrepreneurship is like science in that experiment is the sole judge of truth.",1304463642

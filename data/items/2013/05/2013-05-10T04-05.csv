Many dorms might be undesirable holes in your mind, but they also might be a lot more fun.<p>Some people place little value on the room they sleep in and a lot of value on having access to an amazing city like New York. In fact, I'd say that's often a better life choice than isolating yourself in the suburbs.",1368161919

5684709,comment,5684062,5684651,1,0,mindcrime,,,"Fair enough.  I also <i>generally</i> dislike intolerance, but I do have my areas where I find it hard to be tolerant.  As an atheist, I have very little use for religion, religious dogma or teachings, etc., and I think that religion is actively harmful to society.  So in that regard, I'm probably not so far removed from the guy you quoted above.  But... I have no problem being tolerant of religious <i>people</i> in that I don't find much need to go around trying to convince everybody who isn't an atheist that they are an idiot, or doing the inverse of what I have having done to me - excessive proselytizing.  I'm not out to convince Christians or Hindus or Muslims, etc. to disavow their faith.   But when I come across situations (public education, for example) where religious beliefs start affecting things that I believe belong outside the bounds of religion, then I start to get a bit prickly about the whole thing as well.<p>I guess that was just a long-winded way of saying ""it's complicated"".<p>The other thing I'll add is this:  I do visit /r/atheism, albeit infrequently.  And you're probably right that it's not a particularly nice place to visit for people who are actively religious.  That doesn't bother me only because I go in with the assumption that they aren't going to be there, aren't interested in being there, and that the few who do come in and stick around are the kind of people who can look past the stylistic stuff and still engage in a conversation which is - hopefully - enlightening for both sides.<p>I guess that was a long-winded way of saying ""it's all about expectations"".<p>Nonetheless, I can understand why you might shy away from /r/atheism.

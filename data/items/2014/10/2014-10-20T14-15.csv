Secondly, you&#x27;re not made to use it at all... Apple makes it really easy to turn off in settings, and with particularly fine grained control.  If you don&#x27;t use it, things fall back gracefully to local storage.
Thirdly, I&#x27;ve not seen a competitor that works better.  Google isn&#x27;t even trying (it&#x27;s web only- the equivalent of iCloud.com without the numbers, pages and keynote apps for mobile and desktop.)   That&#x27;s not a slam on google, the web is what google does.  It&#x27;s just the closest competitor.<p>If iCloud was bad in comparison to something else, people would be using that other thing.<p>I&#x27;m just glad I can now finally get rid of Dropbox once and for all.",1413817093

Also added a link to the 1Password blog.<p>1Password dropped support for the legacy Dropbox sync API some time ago. I was a bit bogged as well, because it needed me to re-buy 1Password from the Appstore. Previously I had v3, v4 needed to be re-bought. When you were a user of 1Password v3, they made that very transparent and also wrote[1] about it on their blog<p>That sucked, _but_ I get why they did it. v3 used an API of DB that was legacy and they didn&#x27;t want to support it anymore, because they had a new implementation around the corner which used iCloud.<p>And in my experience synching got improved a lot. Yes, re-buying sucks, but that&#x27;s the developers choice. That&#x27;s not related to iCloud at all. Plus, the new version works better for me, so kudos to 1Password to improving their product - and charging for it seems to work, I paid them lots of money and still am a happy customer(;<p>1. <a href=""http://blog.agilebits.com/2013/08/08/1password-3-dropbox-sync-faq/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.agilebits.com/2013/08/08/1password-3-dropbox-syn...</a>",1413817089

I was hoping that post-Snowden, this kind of request from some countries that companies need to store data locally, to make sure the data isn&#x27;t taken by the US government, would encourage companies to encrypt the data end-to-end (client-side), before they get it into their clouds. Then nobody could complain about the data not being safe from the US government. It should be safe since even the company shouldn&#x27;t have access to it.<p>I realize this isn&#x27;t the <i>real</i> reason why China told Apple to build a datacenter there, but that&#x27;s the one they used publicly, and as long as the company itself can get access to that data, then the argument is a pretty plausible one, even from China. Apple, Google and others could <i>weaken</i> this argument by adopting end-to-end encryption for their services.<p>Unfortunately, it seems the companies decided to keep the data as is, but build the data centers in Russia, China and wherever else they might ask them to do it.",1413817080

If you could measure the amount of buffer overflows in the tree on the day OpenBSD was forked from NetBSD, and year after year up to now, you&#x27;d see a very clear trend.  The situation is only getting better, and the fact that the OpenBSD team tries to clean up and polish old code instead of just rewriting and churning out &quot;cool new&quot; replacements for everything really helps.  Year after year, the same old code is subjected to mass audits (such as the recent reallocarray() job, wight might&#x27;ve very well triggered the discovery of some bugs in col, including the one referred to in this commit).  Other bugs are found in actual use.  And, of course, new tools find new problems.  New &quot;hostile&quot; changes in the system reveal new bugs.

If your company has merged, been acquired, or acquired another company within the last 2 years, you should be looking.  If you do not get at least a 2% raise every year, without fail, you should be looking.  If your vacation and sick pay recently went to PTO instead, you should be looking.  If your company is pushing &quot;consumer directed&quot; health insurance at you, you should be looking.<p>If your company has an <i>actual</i> interest in employee retention, you have found a real gem.  But the rest of us are getting screwed over too often to ever sit back and pretend to have job security.<p>What I am finding now is that every place I might want to work has no software developer employees my age (which I find to be very suspicious) and every place that does have developers my age or older is a career dead end, SNAFU, or both.<p>And having my ear to the ground for so long, I have noticed a steady progression in HR recruiting practices from barely tolerable to downright rude.  And the time between first contact and offer (if any) is stretching out longer and longer.  (I don&#x27;t live anywhere near California, if it wasn&#x27;t obvious.)<p>So if you want to be an old developer, it appears as though you&#x27;ll first have to solve the problem of how to find steady work without using a resume.  There seems to be an element of chance involved, such that each skill and contact you acquire at your current job gives you another roll or two of the dice for the next.  I really crapped out with my last gig, which yielded zero new skills and zero new contacts, for entirely related reasons, but a contact at the previous job helped me land my current job, where I am working with someone I knew from three jobs ago.<p>I am not a particularly big fan of the good old boy network method of hiring, but if you are both good and old, you still may find it difficult to get hired via the HR process.  That process is fundamentally broken, and it is quite unlikely that any company that interviews you will ever give you more than a single bit of feedback, that being OFFER=false.  Many won&#x27;t even explicitly say it, letting their extended silence do all the talking.<p>So I would venture a guess that older people STAY because the effort of trying to GO has become so excruciating for many of them that it wouldn&#x27;t even be worth it if it resulted in a 50% pay raise.  And for some of them, they know that will never happen.",1413816295

Some percentage %x of your 5 year experience programmers haven&#x27;t really moved much past their first year at all.<p>To be fair, I think of it really as a series of plateaus, not a hard and fast rule.  People get stuck at a level of professional development for all sorts of reasons, internal and external.<p>The thing is, it gets more noticeable the longer time period you are talking about.  Comparing two people with 3 years experience where one of them hasn&#x27;t really progressed past the first year or so, and the other has 3 solid years is a lot different than comparing two people with 30 years experience where one of them hasn&#x27;t really passed the 10 year mark of development and the other has a solid 30.<p>And &quot;useless&quot; is the wrong way of looking at it.  There is a lot of use for a developer with 5-10 years of experience, so long as you don&#x27;t expect them to perform like a developer with 20-30 years experience.  This is true even if they have 30 years on paper, which can be a bit of sticky point w.r.t compensation, but that&#x27;s a different issue.<p>This absolutely happens with lawyers and doctors, by the way.  A real difference is that a doctor has been forced into a good 10 years of professional development before they take the training wheels off, so the base level of competence is much higher.  Some of them don&#x27;t progress significantly beyond that for the rest of their careers, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they aren&#x27;t productive for that whole time.<p>As an industry, I do believe that software development is pretty weak on developing talent internally, particularly beyond the entry level.",1413816287

There&#x27;s no &#x27;differing threshold&#x27;, even if it might look that way, if that&#x27;s the only data you have available to you.<p>A democratic nation-state fights a war in a very different way than one without such sophistication. The American political will to fight arises out of its sense of justice and duty. We really believed we were fighting for freedom. Until it became abundantly clear that we weren&#x27;t, we were happy to throw men and money into the meat grinder for years upon years.<p>A non-democratic nation fights for as long as the person directing the war maintains his ability to do so. That is the key difference between a western power and an emerging nation. We&#x27;ve got beliefs that can be orchestrated into terrific displays of force, other nations have to coerce the means to project force from the people somehow.<p>It&#x27;s what we are doing in Iraq and Afghanistan right now. As long as most Americans believe that what we are doing there is right, we&#x27;ll keep at it no matter what. Oh we might pour more or less money into it, adjust our military footprint, but we&#x27;re going to keep fighting the good fight for as long as we believe that it&#x27;s the good fight. That belief is robust, it will resist attempts to dislodge it, the same way that a person&#x27;s irrational beliefs aren&#x27;t simply changed.<p>The Vietcong eventually came to realize this. They used their dwindling resources to stage attacks, not where they were needed militarily, but where they would be filmed. The culmination of this strategy was the Tet Offensive, which was carefully orchestrated to look far more large-scale, at least on cameras, than it was. It was an amazing feat, and it accomplished exactly what it had set out to, to tip the balance of public opinion against the war. Militarily, it was a failure, none of the attacks went anywhere and the fighters faded back into the jungle as quickly as they emerged.<p>It wasn&#x27;t anything like how many soldiers we lost that caused us to pull out.

Written by Don Hopkins.<p>Will Wright, the designer of SimCity, SimEarth, SimAnt, and other popular games from Maxis, gave a talk at Terry Winnograd&#x27;s user interface class at Stanford, in 1996 (before the release of The Sims in 2000). At the end of the talk, he demonstrated an early version of The Sims, called Dollhouse at the time. I attended the talk and took notes, on which this article elaborates. I was fascinated by Dollhouse, and subsequently went to work with Will Wright at Maxis for three years. We finally released it as The Sims in 2000, after several name changes: TDS (Tactical Domestic Simulator), Project-X (everybody has one of those), Jefferson (after the president, not the sitcom), happy fun house (or some other forgetable Japanese placism).<p>At the talk, he reflected on the design of simulators and user interfaces in SimCity, SimEarth, and SimAnt. He demonstrated several of his games, including his current project, Dollhouse.<p>Here are some important points Will Wright made, at this and other talks. I&#x27;ve elaborated on some of his ideas with my own comments, based on my experiences playing lots of SimCity, talking with Will, studying the source code and porting it to Unix, reworking the user interface, and adding multi player support.<p>----<p><a href=""http://www.donhopkins.com/drupal/node/35"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.donhopkins.com/drupal/node/35</a><p>The Future of Content - Will Wright&#x27;s Spore Demo at GDC 3/11/2005<p>What I learned about content from the Sims.

She touches on some important ideas, including &quot;Tuned Emergence&quot; and &quot;Design by Accretion&quot;.<p>Chris&#x27; honest analysis of how and why &quot;the gameplay didn&#x27;t come together until the months before the ship&quot; is right on the mark, and that&#x27;s the secret to the success of games like The Sims and SimCity.<p>The essential element that was missing until the last minute was tuning: The approach to game design that Maxis brought to the table is called &quot;Tuned Emergence&quot; and &quot;Design by Accretion&quot;. Before it was tuned, The Sims wasn&#x27;t missing any structure or content, but it just wasn&#x27;t balanced yet. But it&#x27;s OK, because that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to work!<p>In justifying their approach to The Sims, Maxis had to explain to EA that SimCity 2000 was not fun until 6 weeks before it shipped. But EA was not comfortable with that approach, which went against every rule in their play book. It required Will Wright&#x27;s tremendous stamina to convince EA not to cancel The Sims, because according to EA&#x27;s formula, it would never work.<p>If a game isn&#x27;t tuned, it&#x27;s a drag, and you can&#x27;t stand to play it for an hour. The Sims and SimCity were &quot;designed by accretion&quot;: incrementally assembled together out of &quot;a mass of separate components&quot;, like a planet forming out of a cloud of dust orbiting around star. They had to reach critical mass first, before they could even start down the road towards &quot;Tuned Emergence&quot;, like life finally taking hold on the planet surface. Even then, they weren&#x27;t fun until they were carefully tuned just before they shipped, like the renaissance of civilization suddenly developing science and technology. Before it was properly tuned, The Sims was called &quot;the toilet game&quot;, for the obvious reason that there wasn&#x27;t much else to do!<p><a href=""http://www.armchairempire.com/Interviews/chris-trottier-the-sims.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.armchairempire.com/Interviews/chris-trottier-the-...</a><p>----",1413815566

Is Amazon&#x27;s &quot;most important job&quot; to come to terms with Hachette? Not even close. One party to the negotiation can walk away; the other cannot. So &quot;mutually agreeable terms&quot; is kind of a hilarious phrase meaning, &quot;we will state the terms, and then you will agree to them. That is now your most important job.&quot;<p>And Hachette is the largest publisher, with something like 16% market share (2010 numbers). That&#x27;s why this negotiation is even happening.<p>When Amazon talks to smaller publishers, this isn&#x27;t even an issue. They are your boss; they tell you what to do; you do it.

Once you made it to Senior engineer you could split off in a management track that went Supervisor, Manager, VP. It worked out fairly well, because the higher level engineers (Principal, and certainly Staff), made well more than the early management track. Going into management was not the only way to get a raise.

I guess your perspective comes from a traditional work environment. Remember that all our finances are entirely transparent. Because of that transparency, any such unfairness (like paying black, gay and female employees less) would stand out painfully to everyone and drive people away from the company, particularly since many of us are quite sensitive to discrimination. For example, when we detected that one of our recruitment sources seemed to have a negative bias (sending us only candidates from fairly &quot;elite&quot; educational backgrounds), several people in the company (including senior people) declared that they would quit if we kept using this source of candidates. Imagine how they&#x27;d react if there was any kind of discernible policy to underpay black/gay/female people??<p>The rest of your comment is just extrapolating from this incorrect assumption, so I won&#x27;t address it.

They had a pretty basic tool that basically amounted to a spreadsheet with some custom logic that pulled data from a bunch of systems and aggregated it so the traders could book a bunch of smaller trades together and get better rates. This tool was super-niche and quite simple from a programming standpoint, but it made the company probably a million dollars a day. So they paid a guy a full salary to maintain it. He had been in the job for 15 years and was pretty well settled in.

While the pros of the cross platform are obvious, their cons were a no go for me:<p>- Native apps development was the only way to use all the features available. I recall one of our customers rushing to native app development, because that one last feature (opening a PDF) was not feasible through the technology they were using.<p>- The produced apps didn&#x27;t &quot;feel native&quot; and had a poor integration in the system.<p>- The performances of the cross platform solutions were really poor, even for simple apps. Those everything but fluid animations are killing UX.<p>This is what I thought 4 years ago. Now many things  have evolved:<p>- Cross platform solutions may have improved<p>- The number of target platform has decreased and the future is clearer: iOS and Android are the clear winners. Samsung Bada, RIM&#x27;s Blackberry, Windows Phone can be ranked either as dead or minor.<p>- iOS development may be easier thanks to Swift.<p>Interestingly, I don&#x27;t see that any mobile pure player (except games maybe) are picking any of those cross platform technologies for their development.<p>What is your opinion?

When each manager has 20 reports, you don&#x27;t need many of them. Even Microsoft is moving this way, and has always focused on a lot of strong ICs; distinguished engineer is a partner level position (I think).<p>I would be quite surprised if the real product direction power wasn&#x27;t held by the principal engineers at Google.

That seems really high to me.  I&#x27;m not even sure if that price includes everything you need to build on. I&#x27;m wondering how normal that is for this kind of thing or if you&#x27;re kind of buying support along with the price, which would make it worth it I guess.",1413813748

And programming looked cooler and easier than EE.<p>I compare programming to writing, more than engineering. There is no engineering in programming. No matter how many &quot;methodologies&quot; are created, writing good programs and good systems is akin to writing a good story or a good book. It takes practice, it takes courage to remove instead of adding, to make it as simple as possible. The best programmers are Hemingways to me. Terse, to the point. It just works. It looks beautiful.<p>In the same vein, a writer doesn&#x27;t usually become a manager. He keeps on writing, until old age, until forever. That&#x27;s what we do, what we like to do. Sometimes one becomes a manager due to money pressures - after all who&#x27;s going to pay a programmer the same as a GM or VP. But people like myself secretly or not see themselves programming until the bitter end.",1413813745

They clearly took it seriously.<p>There are many competing requirements when designing a primitive. Groestl&#x27;s choices were not necessarily wrong, even when treating side-channel attacks as a &quot;big issue&quot;.

8482132,comment,8481487,8481487,0,0,freshflowers,,,"As an old dev (47) who&#x27;s main focus is now management (the only thing I still program is devops stuff), there are some reasons why I stopped being a developer a few years back:<p>1) Developers are treated without much respect. Seriously, even with the scarcity, and even when we do get paid well (which is relatively rare) and have nice perks, developers still don&#x27;t get the kind of respect other similarly highly skilled professionals get. At some point, when you get in your mid-30&#x27;s and compare yourself with other professionals in the same age group, this really starts to grate.<p>2) The vast majority of companies still doesn&#x27;t know how to make developers function properly. Those of us who discuss stuff like Agile, &quot;manager / maker schedule&quot;, remote working, the pros and cons of open office plans, etcetera form a tiny minority, and we live in an echo chamber. 90% of all devs are still code monkeys in the basement. As a developer with a bit of experience and authority I decided to put my effort in changing that (i.e., get into management) to make life better for other developers.<p>3) I felt I was just repeating myself, basically doing the same thing on different platforms in different languages. I found it harder to learn new stuff not because I got &quot;too old to learn&quot;, but because I didn&#x27;t see anything particularly &quot;new&quot; in it, just same shit, different platform, which wasn&#x27;t particularly motivating. (The only exception is the &quot;cloud&quot;, because approaching the infrastructure as a dynamic, programmable resource is actually something new and challenging.)<p>Salary is still very much an issue. All this talk about developers  getting paid so much is total bullshit, with the possible exception of a small minority of SV companies. Developers are seriously underpaid compared to their economic value and scarcity, and it&#x27;s mostly just a matter of a lack of respect for &quot;techies&quot;.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t care about the money (as a manager I currently <i>choose</i> to not get paid more than my best developers, which is making my bosses kinda nervous), but the feeling of getting screwed just pisses me off.<p>Most of you that are reading this: you are most likely not getting paid what you are worth. Not even close. Yes, even those who think they&#x27;re doing fine. I&#x27;ve seen the numbers, and as a profession we are collectively getting screwed, with very few exceptions.<p>There are many professions in which people are less scarce, require less skill, knowledge and experience and add less economic value and still get paid considerably more simply because they are not &quot;techies&quot;.",1413813606

3607354,comment,3606864,3607269,1,0,pasbesoin,,,"Thanks for the response.  I'm still a bit fuzzy this morning, and I think I was conflating a few things.<p>I think:<p>~ They want to get rid of the existing ""basic cable"" distribution.  Which is still analog.  Digital signals consume less bandwidth, don't they?  So, if you are knocking off relatively few basic/analog subscribers on a segment (the rest are already digital), you can more from the elimination of the analog signals -- even though they are ""shared"" -- than you lose to the additional digital signals.  (All the more so if those viewers don't often view TV, e.g. with Comcast those who have ""basic cable"" because their pricing models essentially make it ""free"" when you subscribe for residential internet service.)<p>~ In going all-digital for TV, by not putting the basic channels or some subset on clear QAM (instead, everything is encrypted), they don't need a physical presence to enable/disable TV service -- even for ""basic cable"".  You get a box in the mail, or you have a smart enough / new enough TV, and then upstream controls whether or not you can decrypt.<p>~ As for my ""FCC"" comment, as I somewhat poorly understand it, as part off the ""digital conversion"" negotiations, cable TV companies agreed to maintain the ""status quo"" until... I believe sometime in 2013, was the date finally settled upon.<p>But they've pushed the boundary.  In my area, forcing everything above an ever-shrinking channel set of ""basic cable"" to be digital, with digitally switched (if ""free"", in limited quantities) set top boxes required.  So, your old VCR or DVD recorder or perhaps some older models of Tivo (don't know, don't have one) no longer work fully in that they can't pick the TV channel.  They're dependent upon this digital box and only get whatever one channel it is manually set to output.<p>I'm one of those people who has ""basic cable"" basically because of the Internet pricing.  My parents had ""extended basic"", but found themselves forced to upgrade because these ""freebie"" digital boxes meant that e.g. the Tivo stopped working.<p>Now they pay more, and have some POS Comcast DVR all because Comcast was allowed to skirt the edges (exceed, in spirit if not in (re)interpreted letter, in my opinion) of this ""it stays the same for cable customers until 2013"" agreement.",1329591483

3607322,comment,3604907,3604907,1,0,chegra,,,"Let me see... At first I agreed, then I said no.  Even last week, I was lamenting my 14 hour days on HN[1][2].  If I think only for that day, I lost that day, but if I think over my time here, I'm net positive.<p>What I was failing to realize was I had the ability, just not the opportunity.  Your  ability can only be exercise only at max. 8 hrs if you have a job, and for the most parts it plateaus out, ie your first 100 hrs of programming provides more benefit than your second and so on[but not a excuse not to practice, I leave for another comment]. Your first hour of observing opportunity is good as your 10000th.<p>The thing about opportunities is that they don't appear to have any meaning at first, only when you go back and connect the dots.  For instance, someone ask me how my resume looks so good.  I would say I was helping a friend with their programming assignment who introduced me to their flat mate.  Said flat mate studied philosophy. I knew a little because I hanged with a guy[while doing my undergrad] who had multiple degrees and he used to talk about guys like Hume and so on. Based on that commonality, we became friends.  And what do you know, she was an expert at doing resumes, and helped me finish mines in no time flat.<p>I know it just a resume, but other bigger gains follow the same pattern.  You only notice them in retrospect.  Each time, I think I was goofing off, helping people out with their assignments, sitting with some guy talking philosophy and so on.<p>Sometimes, I see people and they ask for help.  Why am I  so different than them. They think I'm working with a bigger brain.  I tell them you need to relax; get your head out of the book. It's non-intuitive. They tend to respond with you don't need to study, you have an in built advantage since birth.  But, really is that the truth?  If you get your head out of the book, you start doing things you want to do.  You become curious, a positive pulling emotion.<p>You guys know how it's done. You find something new and interesting on HN, you research it.  Then you find something from that new and interesting,  and you research it.  By the time you would have finished, you would have covered something you needed to study for, all the while remaining curious and looking particularly like a lazy bum.  The other way around, things are a drag.<p>You add on that, the community has common themes coming through[eg. meditation, stoicism]. Raise your hand if you read ""A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy."" through solid recommendations on HN.  And by God, it was a good book.  It provides a perspective on life most would never get.  With these common themes you can connect with members here, who might not be able to help you directly but indirectly opportunities might come their way that they might not be able to exploit and pass them onto you.<p>Also, it is not only about taking. It is about giving.  How many times have you read a comment that refined your perspective or perhaps you gave an insight.  What about when people ask for help on HN. Even if you just gave an up click, that is a massive contribution if you did it in the first few minutes of a post.  If you think hard enough you will know these up clicks save/change lives.<p>What I'm basically saying drinking from the firehose can seem like a waste of time, but over the long hall it works out.  Working on your ability alone means that you are trying to create an opportunity, and in a weeks period you can only create one opportunity if you work really hard, and it might not pan out. On the other hand, reading one hour of HN provides you with hundreds of opportunity, most you will not explore, but still you know they are there and can share with friends who can thus building strong relationships.<p>For instance, you heard it mentioned that one of the ways to create value is to see what opportunities can be exploit from delivering old technology in a knew way. Before, publishing use to take longer.  Now, it is short with kindle, people can exploit that.  Instead of giving their book one title they can create the same book with different titles and layouts[is this against Amazon policy], maybe even different content to match a different audience to scope a bigger payout.  They can now use stuff like A/B testing[looking at paraschopra.] You see what I just did there.<p>It's either that or you need to tell me Chester go finish up my weekend project and stop procrastinating.  But my thoughts are I'm winning so far for the most parts, and I never change a winning team.  We observe it in basketball, there is this one guy who doesn't seem to contribute anything, but you are winning and when he is not there you are not winning[HN/News is that one guy].  Some smartass might look at it and say we can do better; lets cut this loser out, he is not contributing, then you start losing.  You got too smart for your own good, never change a winner.  Some things might be so complicated that you don't even know what is contributing to your success.<p>If you are on HN, and everything is going fine for the most part, don't change it, don't lose your competitive edge you lazy bastard.[Sorry if I sound incoherent]<p>[1] <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/chegra/status/168805385447284736"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/#!/chegra/status/168805385447284736</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/chegra/status/168805177523048448"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/#!/chegra/status/168805177523048448</a>",1329590753

It appears there was a study done in 1992 which had similar results (I wouldn't be surprised at either possibility: I misremembered it as the 1970s, or there was a different study done in the 1970s by Friedman, as the particulars I remember are a bit different, 1901-1970 instead of 1944-1989.)<p>Found this, which gives a figure of 10X for a ""hospital bed""
""In 1992, the Hoover Institution published an essay by Milton Friedman titled ""Input and Output in Medical Care,"" 
<a href=""http://mises.org/daily/3793"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org/daily/3793</a><p>And also:
""Some years ago, the Nobel-laureate economist Milton Friedman studied the history of healthcare supply in America. In a 1992 study published by the Hoover Institution, entitled ""Input and Output in Health Care,"" Friedman noted that 56 percent of all hospitals in America were privately owned and for-profit in 1910. After 60 years of subsidies for government-run hospitals, the number had fallen to about 10 percent. It took decades, but by the early 1990s government had taken over almost the entire hospital industry. That small portion of the industry that remains for-profit is regulated in an extraordinarily heavy way by federal, state and local governments so that many (perhaps most) of the decisions made by hospital administrators have to do with regulatory compliance as opposed to patient/customer service in pursuit of profit. It is profit, of course, that is necessary for private-sector hospitals to have the wherewithal to pay for healthcare.<p>Friedman's key conclusion was that, as with all governmental bureaucratic systems, government-owned or -controlled healthcare created a situation whereby increased ""inputs,"" such as expenditures on equipment, infrastructure, and the salaries of medical professionals, actually led to decreased ""outputs"" in terms of the quantity of medical care. For example, while medical expenditures rose by 224 percent from 19651989, the number of hospital beds per 1,000 population fell by 44 percent and the number of beds occupied declined by 15 percent. Also during this time of almost complete governmental domination of the hospital industry (19441989), costs per patient-day rose almost 24-fold after inflation is taken into account.""
<a href=""http://mises.org/daily/3586"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org/daily/3586</a><p>The 24 fold figure above may well be where I got the ""26 fold"" claim I made.  Since the government has been running a deficit for a long time, including the period of the study, taking inflation into account is appropriate.  Inflation is what happens when the government spends more than it take in, it prints the extra money.  The impact of inflation on an economy is the devaluation of the unit of currency, causing a rise in the prices of everything denominated in that currency, including health care.",1329590623

I love the hook how I first thought he was going to be talking about the nature of businesses and why real estate is a good investment and probably give us some startup advice derived from looking at real estate.<p>I am an old fart so it is sometimes difficult for me to judge how much young whippersnappers know about the history of these things.  But in my lifetime (I'm sure an even older fart can point to even earlier history) this kind of government seizure of property started in the 1980s when Ronald Reagan signed into a law the concept of ""Civil Asset Forfeiture"".  At the time there were lots of stories in the news media about drug lords and how big their mansions were etc.  The MegaUpload stories about all the cars, etc are in the same vein.  This law was pitched as ""denying drug dealers the profits from their criminal activity"".  (Nevermind that drug dealing is not criminal activity in the US at the federal level- the constitution doesn't authorize regulation of substances, which is why for prohibition they needed a constitutional amendment....but also due to prohibition they learned that making things legal under the constitution was a huge pain in the butt and why not simply ignore it? What's the odds that a supreme court filled completely with appointees from the two parties will overturn unconstitutional laws passed by those same two political parties?)  In the same way, seizing domain names is not authorized by the constitution either.  It doesn't even make logical sense (e.g.: someone selling counterfeit jerseys- ok, raid the warehouse and seize the counterfeit products, you can make an argument for that, but a domain name is not physical property, and it could be used for any number of things.)  Many of the domains that have been stolen were engaging in literal free speech-- like the hip hop blog that was talking about hip hop music[1].  That's unquestionably speech.  Worse, the music they were sharing was given to them by record labels as part of their promotional efforts, so it wasn't even engaged in copyright infringement!<p>Anyway, of course in the early years you heard about drug dealers getting busted and all their money taken.  Then it started being biker dudes at airports flying across state lines to go buy (and drive back) the harley davidson they've always wanted (saw that on 20/20 in the 1990s) then it started being the guy who sells silver coins with Ron Paul's face on them, having $6M in Gold, Platinum and Silver stolen by the FBI, as punishment for suing the government to get a ruling that his business was legal after a government employee (of the US mint, which was in competition with him via their production of Silver Eagles) said it wasn't.<p>Then it was the guy you went to high school with, who is now a doctor and who has this wacky notion that chronically ill people should not live out their last years in massive pain and so he prescribes sufficient pain medications to relieve their suffering, only to be raided by the DEA, have all of his assets, his house, car, his wires car, all of his money, his savings, all of his stocks, seized as part of the raid.  Forced to sign a confession, and go to prison, as part of a deal where they don't also prosecute all of his employees and his wife, leaving his children as ""wards of the state"".  Of course part of the reason he had to sign the confession is, with all of his assets seized, he was unable to pay for a lawyer. Don't I remember something about legal representation being a right?   All because some non-doctor decided he was giving patients-- who literally were dying, these weren't junkies-- too many drugs for their pain.<p>Imagine how many people with serious pain in the USA suffer because their doctors are afraid to give them the correct dosage lest they too have their lives destroyed by the DEA?  And of course, since the DEA is conducting surveillance, they know the average prescription for given conditions, which, reduced by fear, means that it must continually ratchet lower and lower.  This is barbaric.<p>Naturally, since police agencies get to keep the money they steal, this has resulted in more than one county sheriff operating literal highway robbery schemes whereby they pull over people with out of state plates-- tourists-- and seize anything of significant value they find on them.  I don't know if they bother planting a tiny amount of drugs n the car anymore or not...<p>And of course, this has been going on, in increasingly worse degrees since the 1980s.  But the news report always points out that the ""accused"" who had his money stolen was ""charged with possession"" or some other crime.  Nowadays its the even more vague accusation of planning terrorism.<p>The thing is this-- this is not accidental.  This is not just a weakness in the system.  This is the design of the system.  This is completely deliberate.  This is a situation created with malice and forethought.<p>""Do you think that we want those laws to be observed? We want them broken.

3607238,comment,3606380,3606608,4,0,StefanKarpinski,,,"pron is right: you can inherit behavior from abstract types and abstract types, unlike interfaces, can have code written to them. (In single-dispatch OO languages, you are in the strange situation that you can write code to interfaces if they are arguments but not if they are the receiver of a method; thus, you're in a situation where you can either dispatch on an interface <i>or</i> you can write code for it, but never both at the same time.)<p>Arrays are not fixed size: there are push, pop, shift and unshift operations on them just like Perl, Ruby, etc. This uses the usual allocation-doubling approach so that the entire array doesn't need to be copied every time, but it's still usually much better to pre-allocate the correct size. Of course for small arrays that are typical in Perl, Ruby, etc., it hardly matters. If you're building an vector of 1 billion floats, however, you don't want to grow it incrementally.<p>The sequence/iterable abstraction is duck-typed: an object has to implement methods for three generic functions:<p><pre><code>  i = start(x)
  done(x,i)
  next(x,i)
</code></pre>
The state i can be anything.<p>Lack of implementation inheritance is one of those things that intro to OO books make a big deal of, but when you don't have it, you don't miss it at all  or at least I don't. I've never found tacking a few fields onto the end of an object to be very useful. I don't want to inherit memory layout I want to inherit behavior. Julia's type system lets you write behavior to abstract types and inherit that for various potentially completely different underlying implementations.",1329589428

The closest to that experience comes from Sencha Touch and Spine.js mobile. However, what I have found is that doing things from scratch is really the best way to get as close to native as possible.<p>Sencha touch is a bit heavy and you have to do things their way, and there's a bit of a learning curve (not to mention it doesn't mesh well with a lot of the javascript MVC-style frameworks out there). That said, it really is the most complete, best performant option out there.",1329588196

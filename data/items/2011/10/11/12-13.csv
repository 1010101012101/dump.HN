However, as I type in a Windows vm running on a computer assembled from commodity hardware, I can honestly say that are certainly a much larger number of choices, since neither of those are options with OS X.<p>The Hackintosh stuff is not really relevant either as a) it is not open source, and b) violates the EULA of OS X.

But C++ is still incredibly useful for many developers, and so is GWT.<p>GWT largely exists because it has a reason to exist.  One of its main reasons to exist is that browsers are not standards compliant, and sometimes the standards are ill-defined.  A well-defined abstraction layer on top of that is very useful...  right up until it's not.  Sometimes you need to dig in to Assembly, and sometimes you need to dig in to JS.

And yes, I knew before I saw this benchmark that the GPU was going to be better than the competition. So as I said, <i>better GPU and newer Javascript</i> seems to cover it (particularly when you note the jump of older iDevices due to OS upgrades i.e. newer Javascript).<p>As I said, there's no straight CPU benchmark, or anything that is limited by RAM so """"beats all smartphones"" in benchmarks"" is a fair bit less accurate and complete than what I said.<p>There's also the fact that Hacker News generally frowns upon editorialized headlines. What was so wrong with the original title of <i>""iPhone 4S Preliminary Benchmarks: ~800MHz A5, Slightly Slower GPU than iPad 2, Still Very Fast""</i> that it needed changed?<p>(edit: getting very pernickity now but since you misunderstood my comment about comparing the sunspider benchmarks: Android's javascript loses on the sunspider benchmark to iOS's if run on the same device. So if a 1GHz Android device (without NEON) matches a 800MHz iOS device then it's quite likely  that a 1.2GHz phone chip will beat it by a fair margin in Sunspider with the Honeycomb or ICS V8, by more again on other Javascript benchmarks which it generally does better on, and more yet again on anything that just benchmarks raw CPU power. I keep reading about Apple's magical A4 and A5, so I'm being pedantic on this point, but the gain is that they chose to use a better GPU from PowerVR and updated their javascript VM, not pixie dust or other Apple magic used in their hardware).",1318336416

3098240,comment,3093323,3094264,2,0,BrandonM,,,"Actually, with enough experience with a given vehicle, it is quite possible to smoothly shift it without the clutch. When the engine reaches the appropriate RPM, you let off the gas as you take the car out of gear, smoothly and firmly shift to the next gear at the right time (a super-narrow window), and ease into the gas again. Unfortunately, if you get any of that wrong, you get an unpleasant (and somewhat damaging) grinding.<p>Your transmission is a series of gears with varying ratios of wheel revolutions to engine revolutions. When you upshift, your engine requires fewer revolutions to drive your wheels. When the no-clutch-shifter lets off the gas, the engine's RPM begin to fall. With the correct timing, the shift is performed during this drop in RPM such that the engine's current RPM matches the RPM necessary to drive the car at this speed in this new gear. This obviates the need for a clutch, since the engine and the rest of the drivetrain (for which the transmission is the link) are being manually synchronized: the shift is performed with a technique that keeps everything spinning at the same relative speed.<p>When you depress the clutch pedal, the transmission disengages from the engine, allowing you to freely shift without regard to the engine's machinations. When you let out the clutch, what typically occurs is that a carbon disk slips a bit before fully rengaging, allowing the engine and the rest of the drivetrain to gradually synchronize. This is the ""catch"" that you feel when you let out the clutch.<p>To illustrate explicitly, let's say we're shifting from 3rd gear to 4th gear at about 30 MPH, and for this car at 30 MPH the engine must spin at 5000 RPM in 3rd gear and 3000 RPM in 4th. Without the clutch, you left off the gas and pull the car out of gear (taking it out of gear is a split-second after letting off the gas), the engine's speed (RPM) begins to fall as you pull the shifter into 4th, and just as the engine hits 3000 RPM (on its way down to 1000, the idling rate), you shift the transmission fully into 4th gear. With the clutch, you jam the clutch and shift, and the engine could be anywhere from 1000-4500 RPM when you let the clutch back out. The clutch slips a bit, allowing the engine to reach the appropriate 3000 RPM before it is fully engaged. Without the clutch, you have <i>very</i> little room for error.",1318335682

There's a good reason half of Vermont is still dirt or gravel.",1318334801

Hell, Mac OS X is the most popular open sourced operating system on the planet. The Safari web browser is just a thin shell around webkit. Apple could have kept both closed and innovated on them, instead they innovate on them and give them away (and yet so called ""open source"" fans actually complain about this.)<p>Wow! This is great news.  I've been waiting for this to happen so that I can go ahead an run OS X on any computer I choose.  Kindly point me to the link?  I would have guessed it was at <a href=""http://opensource.apple.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opensource.apple.com</a> but alas, that's just a random assortment of parts which I'm limited to using for ""internal research and development"".",1318334481

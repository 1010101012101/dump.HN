I can listen to, and even sing, songs whose lyrics I've never verbally parsed. So I get on great with songs that sound good but have idiotic or nonsensical lyrics (Phoenix or The Smashing Pumpkins, for example) because I don't interpret them anyway.

1995911,comment,1995191,1995660,0,0,jcr,,,"I used to write extensively, but due to my health, on good days I can\nnow only muster a handful of paragraphs. I have stretches of months on\nend where all of my time is spent just reading, all input, and no chance\nof even the smallest output without pain. It is infuriating.<p>I went for a dual major in English and Mathematics, so I'm not entirely\nan autodidact in English, but I still like to believe my own study and\npractice was more beneficial than directed study. At least, it feels\nthat way, but this is most likely due to cognitive bias.<p>I have multiple lawyers, judges, and justices in my family, as both\nimmediate and distant relatives. I enjoy case law and ""reading law""\nalbeit I have no true aspirations towards becoming a lawyer. The idea\nof ""reading law"" to become a lawyer is very tempting challenge, but\nthere's little point in becoming a lawyer when I can lose my ability to\nwrite for long periods of time.<p>As a bit of a shut-in with too much time on his hands (pun intended), I\nhave read your posts for years, even longer than I've had this account.\nAgain, there was little point in joining HN when I could not post and\nparticipate.<p>Your mastery of the English language has always been impressive, but far\nmore importantly, your mastery of the given subject matter is far more\nimpressive. You think well, and hence, you write well --not the other\nway around.<p>In fast paced exchanges, you do not always take the time to read well.\nBut this is true of nearly everyone.<p>In my question to you in my previous post, instead of the term ""spurred""\nI could have easily used ""inspired"" or ""caused"" to lessen effect, or\nalternatively used ""incited"" to give greater effect.<p>The subtle point being, I see this particular piece of your writing as\nreactionary. The vast majority of written law (as I know it) and legal\ncorrespondence (as I know it) is reactionary. Given the significant time\nand effort you have obviously put into both reading and writing legal\nrelated text, you have gained the habit of reaction and think in terms\nof crafting correctly leveled response. It is the perfect mindset of a\nlawyer doing their job, but there is more to writing itself.<p>In the case of this particular piece, it seemed as though something had\nbeen bothering you for a long time, and finally escaped in a frustrated\nreaction. I know that feeling far better than most since I live with it\nbuilding every day. Then again, it could simply be my own\nexternalization, a confirmation bias running rampant.<p>You did not have the luxury of English as your first language, so more\nthan most US lawyers, you had to work much harder to learn it. Those in\nyour profession who did not bother to learn beyond the basics they\nalready knew stand as an affront to the work you've invested in becoming\nmore proficient than they are. In short, they don't care when you do\ncare, and this kind of disparity is always annoying to the latter.<p>Your reaction was a correctly measured and level response, but if I read\nit correctly, your real desire was to convince, express and instruct.\nInstead of trying to write in a new and unfamiliar way, you fell back on\nyour training, or better said, your habits if you will, and wrote a\nreactionary piece.<p>If per chance my analysis is not completely flawed, can you isolate in\nyour own mind the ""last straw"" that finally provoked you to react?<p>Take the time to write a full and harsh rant about the last straw with\nthe intent on never sharing it with anyone. The real goal is to get the\nfrustration out of your system rather than mask your frustration behind\na leveled response. You may <i>think</i> you vented already in your rough\ndrafts, but it's not out until it's out with a vengeance. Be vicious. It\nreally helps.<p>When you're done with the rant, rest. Sleep on it.<p>Now you can get back to the underlying problem; How do I convince others\nin my profession to care about writing?<p>You'll first need to accept this will be an uphill battle. Lawyers are,\nby definition, trained to convince others and trained to avoid being\nconvinced by others. Your target demographic is exceedingly difficult.\nBoth your reasoning and your rhetoric will need to be extraordinary to\nhave any lasting effect. You may need to stop thinking like a lawyer, or\nthinking like a judge, or even thinking like a statesman to have your\ndesired effect.<p>In attempting to make your piece accessible to lay people, namely\nclients, you are not merely helping all of us normal people, but you are\nalso leveraging your position with the lawyers you are trying to\nconvince. How else can you use leverage? I'm sure you have better ideas\nthan I do, but the bar association comes to mind, as well as the judges\nand even the actual laws.<p>The major point I would like to make should be self-evident; we all have\nwriting habits, but the means and methods we normally use may not be well\nsuited for the task at hand. Taking a step back from our usual habits,\nscrutinizing them, and finding our own biases can be very fruitful,\nespecially when you can see the need for another approach and you have\nthe courage to try something different.<p>I'm sorry but my hands are sore and I have to stop here. As always, it's\ntough to show critical thinking without seeming overly critical, but I\nhope this rough draft of my thoughts is of some use to you.",1292110608

If it is, judgment of relative intelligences will probably be clouded, at least as it relates to the person, since evidence that others are intellectually superior in a particular area will often be treated as a threat to the person's identity and ignored or rejected, often subconsciously.<p>If the person has a strong feeling of self worth that is independent of intelligence, they won't care very much, and so can be more objective about whether they're the smartest person in a room, regardless of if they are or aren't.<p>Put another way, there will undoubtedly be situations for a very high percentage of human beings where they happen to be the smartest person in the room. Being able to recognize this doesn't necessarily indicate arrogance or an inflated perception of one's intelligence.<p>Of course this issue is also obscured by the entirely vague and amorphous nature of the very concept of intelligence.

According to Joel's Wikipedia profile [2], he has never been close to Michigan his entire life. It appears to me he has never even set foot in this great state.

Wikipedia, at least as an ideal, is a collection of objective facts with citations. But ""removing cruft""? I'm not saying it can't be done, but I think it would be tough to get a clear consensus within a community on what exactly that entails. Wikipedia itself has flame wars on half of its discussion pages over any details that are less than totally objective, and many that are. It works because the differences being argued about are usually small points that most users wouldn't really notice either way. If you're trying to get consensus on a hundred ""bike shed"" issues on each page... well, good luck.<p>It's a very cool and worthwhile idea though.

Seth is a great guy, but his ideas are somewhat redundant.<p>Books by Seth that I highly recommend:<p>1. Permission Marketing<p>2. All Marketers are Liars<p>3. Purple Cow<p>4. Small is the new big<p>Books by Seth that I do not recommend:<p>1. The Big Moo<p>2. Free prize inside<p>3. Idea virus<p>4. The Bootstrapper's Bible (I am not finished reading this 
one, so don't take my advice on it)<p>I ended up writing him an email explaining my frustration over ""The Big Moo"" and ""Free prize inside"".",1173459367
3206,comment,3204,3204,0,0,pg,,,"Comparing investors to record labels etc is a little harsh. They're notorious for leaving bands with nothing.  Whereas as rich as investors get from startups, founders get richer.  (Myspace is a famous exception precisely because it's an exception.) Two YC startups have gotten bought so far, and the founders made a lot more than we did.",1173458754

Being a member of a group in facebook is mainly about identity creation and signaling. It's so that anyone viewing my profile know that I'm into this 'YC news' thing.<p>Edit: Looks like theres a new post on the facebook blog about how groups are used: http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2249512130.

3196,comment,3171,3193,0,0,danw,,,"I'm not sure if the facebook group is even going to be usefull apart from making it easier to find/contact other users. Now that we have an about field on profiles it will be easier to contact people. Anyone who wants to be contacted can stick a url/email in the field.<p>Perhaps the ability to send messages to users? Or to add people as 'friends'? There are some people who consistently add article that I like and it would be great if I could add them as a 'friend' and then look at a 'your friends submitted articles' page that would aggregate all the stories and perhaps comments submitted by the people on my friends list. It would let people look at new articles being submitted without being deluged like in the current 'new' page.<p>Anyone else think this feature would be good and actually used by us?",1173456907

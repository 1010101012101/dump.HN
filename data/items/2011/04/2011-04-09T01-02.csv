It seems like most of the incidences of UFO sightings happened in the past.  Yet today virtually everybody carries a camera or a phone capable of photography or video, and there are fewer sightings.<p>I have no doubt that there's life beyond Earth.  I'm just not sure there's anything we'd consider a UFO that's been zooming around our airspace.",1302314367

2426258,comment,2426125,2426125,8,0,tptacek,,,"We write a lot of evented code here (libevent and Ruby/EventMachine). Survival skills:<p>* Buffer. A tiny kernel of callback-y code buffers up data and gets an object into a simple coherent state, then a lot of synchronous code handles the action on that buffer all at once. Simplest possible example: HTTP server buffers inbound data and checks for completed request, then hands the whole request off upstream. But the pattern works at higher levels too.<p>* Serialize the slow path. Trade performance for maintainability by taking things that don't need to be fast and fob them off to a message queue with a sync worker on the other end.<p>* Functional decomposition. The temptation is that if the system gives you callbacks for events A, B, and C, that you should simply structure your code around A, B, and C. Instead, abstract away A, B, and C into interfaces. Good example: em-redis does evented Redis (and is a lifesaver), but does not handle blpop well (which is key to using Redis as a message queue). So we have a custom blpopper that just exposes a ""subscribe to this key and get called back on messages"" wrapper.<p>These may not apply to Node (I know js but not Node) but they've kept me sane through many tens of thousands of lines of C and Ruby evented socket code.",1302313667

My experience with it via testing is that due to the large number of screen readers, and then differences within versions of the even the most common screen readers (JAWS for example) is that you can't really expect a consistent experience for your users where you get much more consistency with vanilla HTML. The single largest complaint we received while testing with screen readers on our latest app was related to how the user was informed by their software about dynamically changed content, something I have no control over. The compromise that we implemented was to try to detect screen readers and offer to disable all JavaScript content since the site was designed to degrade gracefully anyway.<p>This is going to be less of a problem for some companies than others, I just happen to be working on software that's designed to help HR departments with their hiring process and specifically with the accurate completion of certain federal forms.

Indeed the market is a discovery process that unearths this information in a way that a planner never could[1].<p>Coase asked the question: if this is so, how do large firms emerge? He identified the cost of transactions to be the key. The higher the transaction costs, the higher the cost of loosely coupled economies. The size of the firm is thus based on the relative costs of transactions (searching, identifying, validating, negotiating etc) vs the inevitable waste caused by planning.<p>In essence, large companies are islands of command economics in the sea of the market.<p>[1] In a related argument, Mises said that even if a planner <i>could</i> know all the variables the resulting problem would simply be too large to solve rationally.",1302312872

I'm having a hard time mentally with this effort and I've only been doing it as an amateur for a bit over three weeks.<p>Having said that, I respectfully, let's see how to say this, not so much ""disagree"" but maybe ""semi-agree"" with the issues you highlight:<p>>> those damned stupid Americans, sending us stuff we don't need<p>I am in no way part of the marketing dept. (just a low-level guy that gets you coffee in the morning), but I have to say in defense of what I'm trying to do, small, lightweight, non-perishable, individually-vacuumed sealed bags of micro-ground instant coffee that can be made with hot OR cold water, I have been specifically told by numerous groups over there, would, if not be needed, definitely be very welcomed.<p>EVEN IF they never get totally ""upstream"" the volunteers who are privately making trips to bring supplies while the government/Red Cross is still in the ""planning"" stages are often times running on very, very little sleep.  Something so simple as being able to shake a water bottle with some flavored instant coffee could the moral (not to mention the driving alertness) of some very, very exhausted people.  And it may find its way even further up the chain.<p>As for custom inspections, I don't know it off-hand but there is an international agreement that Japan is part of where during disasters if you mark the shipments in a specific way, many pass through customs or, if they have to be inspected, are designated ""priority"" and rush-inspected.<p>As for the money being sent, well, there are ""big agencies"" like the Red Cross which raise tons of money and then find themselves in the crosshairs of Bill O'Reilly types again, and again, and again months and months after any disaster when it comes to light that not very much of the money raised actually went to the relief effort people thought they were donating to.<p>As for the fluidity part, here's an example of the fluidity I've come to learn of from speaking to counterparts in Japan: not only is the Red Cross advice of ""it's cheaper for them to buy locally"" not true since understaffed relief agencies have to waste time actually doing the buying, but in Japan's case, they would have to buy the supplies in the VERY EXPENSIVE south to transport to the cheaper north, the problem being the supplies in the north are either gone on the east coast or being hoarded in the west.<p>Oh, and with the recent radiation scare, bottled water is so expensive all of a sudden that it would actually be cheaper for them to use water sent from the U.S. for their relief efforts.<p>So, general truisms may be based from years of experience the Red Cross has in doing relief, but as you say, the situation is fluid and these truisms don't seem to be holding so true anymore, at least for Japan.<p>As far as the ""distribution past that point"" I've found groups that have done it, and are ready and willing to do more.<p>As for the tracking, I just spent and hour speaking with a lady from this organization who would like to merge efforts:<p><a href=""http://www.sparkrelief.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sparkrelief.org</a><p>And you're right, a YouTube clip or two don't convey an accurate picture.<p>But since our store is near one of these:<p><a href=""http://www.mitsuwa.com/english/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mitsuwa.com/english/</a><p>I can tell by the still-sullen looks on many people's faces and the never-ending phone calls that employees make on their breaks and lunches, not to mention the expression on their faces, that while the situation is ""fluid"" the suffering is still very much present.<p>So, you're right - items donated to charities may wind up in warehouses as they've done in the past.<p>But TV tells me that money seems to be no different in many cases.<p>And I've learned something interesting while doing all this.<p>People who won't put $10 towards a donation effort will gladly buy $50-100 worth of something or donate much more than that in sweat if they can feel useful and perceive that their effort is actually going somewhere other than an account at JP Morgan or what-have-you.<p>I agree with you about the clogs and bottlenecks.  But even though I'm by far no expert, the ""fuzzy picture"" that seems to be emerging is that there is not just the good will impulse but tiny dots of, I don't know, network meshes of people of goodwill that are trying to connect with each other all over the place and trying to bypass the big charities altogether.<p>No warehouse, just people ready to collect and people ready to roll up their sleeves and distribute.  Not make plans to distribute, but actually get in their own cars on their own time and take packages out with their own hands.<p>I know it's messy but I've come across so many people who are trying to take matters into their own hands, both as individuals and groups and if we can't use all the technology we have these days to do something like this at this point, then, I don't know, what's the point of life?<p>I may be naive or something but at the same time something in me just refuses to believe that in this day and age when  some folks can send a flying drone halfway across the planet to kill somebody, it's an absolute impossibility to send people diapers, powdered milk and instant coffee, with all the know-how and internet communication platforms that are around.<p>I just can't accept this reality.<p>But I thank you for your thoughtful reply.",1302312822

In that case, the cars probably won't be much, if any lighter than standard cars since all the weight savings will be replaced with batteries.

An 'outside view' - <a href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Outside_view"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Outside_view</a> - could give something reasonable in cases that aren't too novel.<p>I think estimates will never become useless. It's just that we may decide to replace them with ""time by which we'll be late only 1/6 of the time"", and provide feedback and incentives for people to correct this estimate so that it's, for someone who's experienced in the domain, eventually relatively unbiased.",1302310900

As long as buying taxies and renting them out is profitable, taxi operators will continue to do so.

For example, they didn't just make the iPod mini smaller, they offered it in different colors. The iPhone 4S wasn't just a faster iPhone 4, it had Siri. I would be very surprised if a 7"" iPad came out and didn't have some flourish, some differentiator that made it stand out in some way from the regular iPad and things like the kindle fire. Perhaps they make it absurdly thin? Or perhaps the display is a new display that works great in direct sunlight (you are going to read books on the thing)?

As a matter of fact, it was much better than that 8 months ago, but the improvements took a while to become common knowledge. This is a massive problem with Clojure -- there's way too much outdated information out there.<p>For your sanity's sake: don't mess with manual Clojure installation etc. Just use leiningen for everything. It pulls in the Clojure compiler and runtime on its own, offers a much more useful REPL, and even handles Emacs integration these days.

A server that goes 10x faster than it's competitor but cannot work with other servers to go to 100x is not a scalable solution, whether that reason is because of some low level networking limitation or a high level programming or administration limitation.<p>More semantics, but over-engineering is about more than making things complicated.  If a tool doesn't do what it was intended to do, or if you've ignored the proper level of complexity, it's because it was <i>badly</i> engineered, not over-engineered.  <i>Good</i> engineering will ""over-engineer"" things as much as possible within the constraints of the solution.<p>And if you keep that in mind, then you really can't over-engineer things or make them too scalable.",1341919289

There are a lot of people who do a lot of sitting and manage to live very short lives.<p>There might or might not be a health issue with sitting down; for me my personal experience is compelling; I feel YEARS younger since I don't sit more than a few hours a day, relaxing or otherwise. This <i>next</i> to other physical activity. It makes sense to me as well (we didn't used to sit  a lot before 1900, so evolution didn't equip our bodies to do so for 8+ hours/day), but that's not really proof/evidence of anything per se, just as 'a lot of people who sit a lot live long' and 'a lot of people who sit a lot die young' are not ;)<p>I think stress levels are involved too ; sitting cramped / stressed is not very good for you I believe while that is the reality for many 'sitting professionals' ; walking helps reduce stress often so that is a part as well I believe.",1341918122

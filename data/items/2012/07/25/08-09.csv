But I'm already a coder. The skill I miss the most is design, and I'm not talking about how to organize elements on a page. I know this kind of things is very important but it's also pretty easy to learn. The hardest part for me is how to make a user interface beautiful, how to choose colors, how to make gradients, how to add bevels and other 3D-looking effects. For me this is the equivalent of coding and I find it hard to locate resources on how to learn those.<p>And given how hard it is to find a good designer these days (and how expensive it can be), I would really love to be able to do it myself, at least be able to throw together an MVP that doesn't make users bored to death.<p>How would you go about learning those skills? What are some of the best resources for that? Is it even possible to learn those skills quickly or is it just experience?",1343206655

Waving your hands in front of the camera is not an attractive option to me, but there are other possibilities once the tech gets there that seem much more seamless:<p>* Controls on the glasses themselves - not much better than waving hands.<p>* Some other sort of control device you can hold, like an apple remote with more buttons - could be very flexible, but again ties up your hands.<p>* A wearable device like a watch or wrist-band - could be quite unintrusive and should be possible fairly quickly.<p>* Embedded sensors on the body or the fingertips - obviously a way out but these could give great control simply by tapping on the leg or arm. Even typing is conceivable.<p>* Subvocalisation, sensors near the throat or head that can pick up subvocalised or whispered commands - speaking is pretty slow for control commands, but could be great for dictating messages.<p>* Brain control, sensors that can pick up thought patterns - this seems futuristic, but some advanced tech can already move a cursor and even dictate some words using this. Shouldn't be hard to choose from a HUD menu if designed well.<p>Ok, maybe I got carried away, but I'm pretty excited by what this sort of tech will be like in 10 years, especially if we can use contacts instead of glasses.",1343206396

The problem is the bad analytics that caused the inflated expectations in the first place.  Feel free to speculate as to the cause of that as you wish :-).",1343205169

The whole market is moving too fast for those Dinosaurs to keep up with competitors. Where Apple and others improved the user experience I hope to see that the Ouya tackles TV based console gaming without the whole baggage of cert, closed platform and super strict rules that limit innovation business and gaming wise.",1343203509

Forget the text message pop-ups and map overlays, that's all basically meaningless.

Extrapolate it to everyone being able to see whatever they want to see, all the time, and things start to get pretty crazy pretty fast. Highly recommend Vernor Vinge's book Rainbows End for a full look at where this could take us a few years from now.",1343203304

6089074,comment,6085768,6087893,10,0,mattheww,,,"I will explain why lisper&#x27;s explanation of light speed is wrong. The fundamental problem is that it violates the premise of relativity and is a classic example of appealing to an absolute frame.<p>Velocities are only measured relative to other objects. The explanation given by lisper requires an absolute reference frame. Otherwise, you have no way to figure out how much you&#x27;re actually moving through space, and thus, through time because you can never figure out your &quot;true&quot; speed.<p>Relativity tells me that no matter what speed I travel at, I will experience time at the same rate. From my frame of reference, I will perceive things to happen in other reference frames at different rates. When we calculate time dilation and length contraction, we&#x27;re determining that if something took time &quot;t_a&quot; in Frame A, it will appear to have taken time &quot;t_b&quot; to an observer in Frame B.<p>Furthermore, it&#x27;s impossible under relativity to have a frame of reference that moves at the speed of light in any other frame.",1374573286
6089073,comment,6087771,6087771,1,0,davidjgraph,,,"This is misleading. There is 2 types of OAuth2 &quot;flow&quot;, sometimes called server-flow and client-flow. Server-flow is the mechanism where a callback is registered with the auth server, but all comms and the initial auth have to go through some other server, which is just being setup for you in this case.<p>Client-flow is the far more interesting flow, for me, anyway. There the browser client gets the token directly from the auth server, that really is serverless. The key advantages of client-flow are you don&#x27;t need the immediate server (less cost for you) and you don&#x27;t have to see the data if you&#x27;re using a third-party storage (better security and privacy).<p>You do need to be careful with security issues around the auth token itself, in server-flow you store the token on the server and have the session bind you to that token. Stealing a session is harder than stealing a token.<p>I know of two implementations to date:<p>Google&#x27;s Official JavaScript Client library [0]<p>Dropbox&#x27;s Unofficial JavaScript library [1]<p>[0] <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/google-api-javascript-client/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/google-api-javascript-client/</a><p>[1]<a href=""https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js</a>",1374573276

FreeBSD is a great piece of software, but it&#x27;s hardware support is a bit... lacking.<p>From the article I got the impression that the main bottleneck is sharing files between VM and a host system. Probably, I can&#x27;t know for sure because I don&#x27;t do this. Instead I have all my files and software on the VM, including my IDE of choice. I have X server set up on Windows host (Xming) and when I really need to transfer files between a host and guest I do this over s(f|c)p.<p>It probably helps that my IDE is Emacs :) (Before that - gVIM) And I don&#x27;t see any problems with it. Moreover, the only development related thing on the host system is Xming and VirtualBox, so when I change the computer I&#x27;m working on I just need to copy the image and install these two programs and I&#x27;m ready to go - with exactly the same environment everywhere. I used this setup from Linux, too - the only issue I had was that xhost alone didn&#x27;t work for allowing external X connections, I had to edit startx script and remove the &#x27;no tcp&#x27; (or similar) flag from there.<p>At work, where I have a proper desktop with nvidia graphics, I have FreeBSD installed as a main OS. The difference in speed between my environment in a VM on a laptop (with 1GB RAM allocated) and on a host system on a better hardware (with 8GB RAM available) is not that big, which makes me believe that I found an optimal way of working. I don&#x27;t know how more costly virtualization makes disk IO, but I think that compared to general slowness of disk IO this difference is negligible (I don&#x27;t have SSD yet, so my opinion may change in near future!).",1374571121

You want to claim that it&#x27;s highly probable but you&#x27;ve provided no evidence for this. I know that porn addicts brains are different, primarily in terms of the reward system in ways similar to other addictions I believe, but you&#x27;d expect <i>that</i> to be the case.

Even assuming that all of your premises are true, (and the probability of concurrent events is the sum of their multiples so you&#x27;ve lost probability at every stage whatever the actual numbers would turn out to be; complexity penalty) and these brain scans actually exist, what does that mean? Is the probability of harm five times as likely as something else, twenty? If the initial chance of harm is quite small this doesn&#x27;t make much difference. Is it three orders of magnitude out?<p>Neurology is a complicated area of inquiry, unless you know how often a given change links up with some result, it&#x27;s just a picture.<p>You can&#x27;t forget about psychology and stats and still meaningfully make statements like &#x27;it&#x27;s not even on the same chart&#x27; you have to know where both things are to be able to talk about that sort of thing - you have to have put the work in and have the numbers.",1374570378

26286,comment,26191,26191,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"It is my observation that many of the young people who boast about age are gleefully unaware of the horrible failure rate of young, (under 30), entrepreneurs.  Many point out the brilliant successes, without mentioning the 100 other young entrepreneurs that failed in the same space.  The numbers bare out the indisputable fact that older entrepreneurs will fail less often than younger entrepreneurs.  In fact the statistical variance in the success rate is so large that wise VCs and angels actually use age in their models.<p>For instance, if we are advising angels who are want to dabble, but are at heart risk averse, we do swing them over to that 38 year old guy with the new molecular imaging startup.  On the other hand when we are advising VCs and angels that are more than just old ladies' investment clubs, we do steer them to the kids.  This should not come as a surprise to people.<p>It would be a mistake for young people to think that they are better suited to creating successful startups.  They are not.  They are better suited to creating MORE startups, of a decidedly lower quality.  The older entrepreneur in my illustration will show better judgment at every step of the game when compared to a younger entrepreneur.<p>That includes the first step . . . choosing to create a molecular imaging startup instead of a web 2.0 startup that anyone can copy.",1180974861

A lot of the apps aren't very good, true, but others are, and it shows signs that it's heading towards being a commodity, along the lines of web mail.  To do something people will pay for, it's got to be head and shoulders above the competition, and be seriously useful to companies.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=17662"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=17662</a><p>And there's nothing wrong with Rails at all - quite the contrary - I use it extensively myself, and absolutely love it.

26282,comment,26251,26251,0,0,iamwil,,,"I'm kind of amazed, as are other people in the naysayer category have been, that Twitter had taken off as it has.  At its basic form, it's just passing back and forth messages, a problem seemingly solved by email decades ago.  However, twitter obvious is not a question of the underlying technology, but rather, how it is presented to and used by people.  It's gotten people use to the idea of instant self-expression, no matter how inane--for better or worse.  I would have chalked it up for sensors to monitor and log ourselves, but twitter demonstrated that people will report or say anything if there's an audience.  Perhaps trolls have already paved the way in this regard.<p>That said, I think it's easy to write Twitter off as a fad, since the world's largest collection of quips doesn't quite seem to make the world a better place.  My guess is that there's probably value in Twitter, but only when it's married with other sorts of data or text processing.  Just off the top of my head, geospatial data and emotion detection algorithm on twitter data could generate a heat map of how people are feeling place to place, or time to time.  I imagine advertisers would find this information valuable, since they can set up targeted advertising when people are statistically most vulnerable to impulse buying at a certain time or place.<p>If twitter can manage an API or platform to support this sort of thing, they'll be around for a while, I think.  If not, well, at least we'd have the largest collection of quips for the archaeologists of the 22nd century.",1180973666

If we had used Java, PHP, or Python would it really be different?<p>If the argument is just that there are too many web services for managing your to-do list, I might agree--we analyzed them all when writing our business plan. But, the reality is that none of them scratch our itch. And it's not that we're perfectionists; I've never met anyone who's passionately in love with their online to-do list.

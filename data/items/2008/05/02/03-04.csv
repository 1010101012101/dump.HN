Not all startups mind you, I have this musician friend...<p>But I've seen the ""wife has high paying job with steady income, husband is kinda fly-by-night"" pattern often enough that I wonder if other people see it too.<p>I never did find that kind of a women myself.

179208,comment,177995,178673,0,0,alex_c,,,"I agree about the hardware design (Microsoft actually made(?) some pretty good peripherals).<p>I was referring more to software design.  I have never encountered so many plain boneheaded interface decisions as in Microsoft products, from roughly Win95 up to and including WinXP.  I'm not even talking about ugly (which I can forgive), I'm talking about simply unusable - tiny text areas without scrollbars in which you sometimes have to input a large amount of text, or worse, text inputs instead of text areas.  Tabs being used where they really shouldn't, resulting in dialogs with up to 5 rows of tabs, and with extra ""Advanced"" buttons on some of the tabs that bring up another pop-up.  That kind of stuff.  Vista and the new Office have been really pleasant surprises so far in this respect.",1209697823

I doubt it would catch on though.<p>A good rule of thumb is that things that encourage people to be healthier or smarter will not be popular.  The things that gain popularity are tools that allow people to be lazier and stupider.  Social networking is a way for morons to say stupid things to one another with less effort.  Google allowed idiots to search the web without knowing anything about boolean search terms.  etc.",1209697631

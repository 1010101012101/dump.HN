It is a marketplace for freelancers.  For clients it is a way to search for freelancers in their area, at their pricepoint. For freelancers it is portfolio management, lead generation and (eventually) contracting and payment services.<p>We are focusing the search to be local (Designers in Portland) and not on specific cost (a 'competitive' search yields the ~65% of the market) This is much different than many other sites that really focus on bidding to the lowest cost in the world.  We are not that.<p>Our broad statement is: professional tools for freelancers.  Our shorter motto is: celebrate freelance.<p>We are working to build a site that allows search on:\nType of Freelance\nAvailability\nCost\nRecommendations / Connections (linkedin connection)<p>In the next few weeks we are adding a simple contracting and payment option, essentially adding a 'buy it now' button to a freelance portfolio.<p>If you freelance and want to sign up put 'HN' in the invite code: http://pick.im/request/invite",1270065394

In an HDMI situation if you use a cheap cable and the picture and sound are fine, buying a more expensive cable isn't going to change anything.  With HDMI in particular, if the cable is failing you'll know right away with either a poor picture or sound.  It won't have the gradations that were possible when pushing an analog signal around - i.e. the picture looks could, but it could be sharper with a better cable.<p>I'm not sure why you brought ethernet into the mix, but generally you're talking about much longer runs than HDMI and it's often not as easy to see when your are losing packets without specifically checking if you are dropping packets (IMHO poor network performance IS failing outright, but not as easily seen as a bunch of blocks on the TV).  Even then, the cable you use is either delivering all the packets or it isn't (up to an acceptable level of errors/loss for the length you are running).  Delivering a stronger 1/0 isn't going to change anything as long as it's strong enough for the receiver to differentiate.  That's where it either works or it doesn't comes from.",1270063253

I want those things so bad I can feel it in my bones but because of financial reasons I own a practical family car, take a cruise every so often, fly coach most of the time, eat 4-star only 2-3 times a year and I shop at an outlet mall for my clothes which I keep in my boring suburban closet and when I travel I get a reasonably priced hotel with clean sheets and free breakfast in the lobby.<p>Am I living a mediocre life because my ambitions have outpaced my bank account?<p>Not really.<p>Are those fun things to shoot for as long-term, fantasy filled life goals?<p>Sure thing. I think that lots of successful people are successful because of a general dissatisfaction with the status quo. Their life is great, but can't it be just a tad better? And I think that's fine as a motivational tool.<p>But just because I'm not followed around by my own personal string quartet to provide atmosphere while I'm eating lunch doesn't mean playing the same music on my laptop somehow makes my life just oh so not worth it all.<p>I disagree with the basic sentiment that, ""I didn't get everything I wanted, whenever I wanted it, all the time, so I'm living a mediocre life."" That's a bunch of nonsense. By this definition, nobody lives beyond a mediocre life. Not the Sultan of Oman, Bill Gates, Warren Buffet or Kim Jong Il.<p>I think a better definition is this ""are you on the path to the things you want? if not, you live a mediocre life."" For example, I really want to eat 4-star meals 3 times daily. To do that takes lots and lots of money. I don't eat that way now, but as I move up in the world, I make more money and can thus eat 4-star meals with a higher frequency. I'm pretty satisfied with this. Next year, I plan to eat more 4-star meals than this year. And the year after, likewise.<p>Now supposing, all I could do is eat at Taco Bell every day (I've been there). I am not on that path. I can't even taste the sauce of a good bœuf bourguignon. I'm living a mediocre life. This motivates me, how do I get my bœuf bourguignon? How can afford to eat at Chez Francois and taste that succulent dish? I would save, but I barely make enough money as is. I know! I'll make more money! How do I do that? And on and on and on....<p>Eventually, I get on the path and my life is fulfilled. But I may have had to do things that I didn't necessarily want to do. Like work full-time, or take fewer vacation days, or commute an hour each way. Tough, that's life, that's not mediocrity.",1270063216

English Wikipedia already has more existing content for scaffolding so you're not writing from scratch; 2. English is seen as more official/academic, so an encyclopedia article in Hindi feels wrong, like writing a journal article in Hindi; 3. for India-specific topics in particular, writing in English is seen as a way to disseminate information about India and Indian culture to a worldwide audience; 4.

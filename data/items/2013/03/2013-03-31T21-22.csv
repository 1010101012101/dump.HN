As knowing the basics of JavaScript is pretty much a requirement for working with CoffeScript I never ever encountered any problems when debugging generated code because is not obfuscated and easy to read and the compiler doesn't do anything you didn't specifically write in your CoffeeScript. I am going to go out on a limb here and say that I think compiled CoffeeScript is easier to read then most peoples hand written JS. What makes code unreadable is the Closure compiler which is completely different beast.",1364767115

I especially like the comparisons among differing brands of online courses.<p>Before I read the fine article (which I recommend you read too), I was going to react just to the headline. And that reaction is still there. The reason we (correctly) criticize lack of retention in online education is that online education makes apparent metrics that show the lack of retention. But I would suggest, for learned discussion by all the participants here, that most forms of classroom learning, and especially compulsory secondary schooling in most of the developed world, suffers from a very bad lack of engagement on the part of the students. (Some of the comments posted here before this comment tell stories about that.) A high school student may attend classes often enough to avoid being expelled and gain a diploma, but the student may operate in ""regurgitate and forget"" mode the whole time he is in high school, not really remembering anything he supposedly was taught. The one kind of deep learning many high school students engage in is learning how to pretend to be studying. If online education develops better demonstrations of learner acquisition of knowledge and skill than mere seat time in a classroom, it may be a powerful force for exposing the dirty secret of classroom education.",1364766874

People do have a responsibility to educate themselves. Especially when they are in a position of responsibility.<p>The writer self-filtered himself from the opportunities available by not seeking out opportunities. Universities two thousand miles away should (and do) try to make themselves known to students. But that doesn't relieve a person of responsibility. If you don't have the motivation to find out about them, then you probably wouldn't succeed at the school anyway.",1364766873

I can imagine a future where the background your wife needed would be easy to get from the platform itself, so that the profs' demanding teaching could serve audiences both with and without that background.

You may be right, that edX and Coursera require a big commitment, but that's what learning requires. Do you want to play games for an hour, or do you want to advance your skills and understanding?<p>(I've completed the Codeacademy Javascript track, and a full Coursera class (livin' in the 5%, wooo!)).<p>You say Codeacademy got it right, but I think you're dead wrong. As other articles today have pointed out, at best you're going to learn syntax on codeacademy, and the most basic programming principles, but you'll be miles away from being a capable programmer. The jump from the online editor with tiny little exercises to setting up your own environment and programming your own project is huge. Many of their lessons give misleading or outright incorrect information, not to mention teaching you bad practices.<p>What this article says is the huge barrier to entry, is not a barrier to entry to online education, but a barrier to entry of learning. What the author proposes is solutions to hide the barrier of learning, by gamifying the platforms and making them more ""fun"" with a disregard for the depth of effectiveness, and the consequences of pursuing such techniques. (Obviously I'm delving into opinion land, but I strongly believe gamification cheapens and platform and doesn't produce the deep engagement necessary for learning. This is my assessment from my experiences, I'm not going to tell someone their wrong for feeling differently about this. But I think if you wanted to create a deeper experience from gamifying education, it would take a tremendous effort, far different from the typical ""Wow you completed 5 exercises! ZOMG KEEP GOING!"" joke of rewards that other websites have.<p>I don't want to rail on the online education effort either, but this is plain cheap thinking. Coursera and EdX are doing an excellent job, but they certainly have many problems to surmount. They've definitely solved the problem of higher education accessibility, now the problems they have are in the effectiveness of education, and on administration and grading that gets the f#$% out of the way of learning.

MOOCs are media, only one part of the ecosystem that is developing here, and I think that finding a central role for great educators is key.<p>Coursera and other MOOCs are media properties that monetize viewership (thorugh certificates rather than ads).   As media properties, michaelochurch and others are right that the synchronous model isn't really going to work in the long term.<p>I think ed tech should be about connecting teachers with the content they need to teach (and I'd include self-educators amongst 'teachers' here).  Students need synchronous access to teachers, but those teachers don't necessarily have to have created that content just now.  This suggests that online education might look more like a 1:100 teacher-student ratio rather than 1:100k. Nothing's more motivating and engaging than a human being.<p>Personally, my best experiences have come from two sources: self-study from great materials and guided study from great teachers.  This suggests that a role for ed tech might be connecting great teacher with great content rather than broadcasting teacher-as-content.  Personalization, engagement, motivation, etc all come for free if we empower great teachers rather than seek to replace them.<p>It's misguided to think that some professor from a great school can best deliver the content to all audiences.  Imagine great open content accessible to every teacher for use in their own classrooms.  With an inverted model of teaching, the lets them push content out to the students for self-study and then have synchronous classes where they, the teacher, can motivate and customize the delivery of tough concepts for their particular group of students.",1364765517

I am a long-time user of Coursera and I love the site.<p>I have feedback for you as regards retention of students.<p>The number one thing is due dates and late penalties. If I sign up for a course and work through the first few weeks and get everything done, and then I miss a deadline because life happens, suddenly I am no longer able to get a 100% in the class. I do not mind getting an A- in a class if it happens naturally because the material is difficult, but losing my A+ or A because I am 12 hours late on an assignment ruins the experience for me. I usually drop a class when this happens and wait for it to come around again.<p>A counter-example to prove the rule: Robert Sedgewick's Algorithms course. The last time he gave it, he had late penalties and I only had time to get through the first two weeks of the class without getting behind. This time around, there were no late penalties. Being enormously busy with other things, I was not able to keep up with the class as it went along. However, because I lost no credit for doing things late, I was able to complete the entire class in the final 10 days of course and I got an A. I have no problem staying up all night to finish interesting programming assignments and quizzes, but I need to be allowed to do this on my schedule.<p>I strongly encourage you to encourage your professors to do away with late penalties. It should be up to us as students to determine what our work schedule is. I know for some courses, those that use peer-evaluation, this is impossible, but many more could take this route than currently do.<p>I agree that Signature Track does have the effect of encouraging one to keep up with the class.",1364765022

5470181,comment,5469347,5469347,16,0,graycat,,,"I believe on-line learning can work.<p>Why?  Three reasons:<p>First, a 'dirty little secret' of the US software
industry is how much of the learning from the
beginning of electronic computing to the present has
been just from individuals teaching themselves from
books, e.g., K&R on C, Lippman on C++, Ullman on
database, Sedgewick on algorithms, and on-line,
e.g., Microsoft's MSDN site, StackOverflow, etc.,
essentially independently without courses, lectures,
problem sessions, credits, homework, tests, etc.<p>Or since just K&R, ..., StackOverflow, etc. have
been responsible for so much learning so far, then
'the bar is low' and on-line courses should do even
better.<p>Second, in my experience in technical subjects, pure
and applied math, mathematical physics, some topics
in electronic engineering, e.g., surrounding the
fast Fourier transform (FFT), and software, with a
class or not, nearly all the learning (in my case)
took place from study, alone, in a quiet room, from
good materials just on paper.  My 'educated guess'
is that on-line learning can't replace such learning
but can help stimulate more of it.<p>Third, for a researcher in applied math and
software, and also likely some other fields, one of
the main 'work items' is to take recent books and
papers and work through them much as working through
advanced course materials in such subjects.<p>Back to my case, in the fields I worked hardest on
and did the best in, math, physics, and software,
starting in the ninth grade, through my Ph.D., and
in my career to the present, I did nearly all the
work with relatively little contribution from
teachers.  E.g., in plane geometry my teacher was
the most offensive person I've ever known in
education, and I slept in her class and refused to
admit doing her assigned homework.  Instead, I
worked every non-trivial problem in the book
including the more advanced supplementary problems
in the back where she never made any assignments.
Then, after working all those problems, no wonder,
on the state test in the subject, I did fine:  I
came in second best in the class; the guy who beat
me also beat me by a few points on the Math SAT --
we were 1, 2 in the school.  Net, my approach to
learning plane geometry worked fine.<p>I never took freshman calculus.  The college I
started at wanted me to take some math that really
was just a review of what I'd covered in four years
of math in high school.  So, a girl in the class let
me know when the tests were, and I showed for those.
The teacher said I was the best math student he'd
ever had.  Meanwhile, I got a good calculus book and
started in, worked hard, and did well.  For my
sophomore year I went to a much better college and
started on their sophomore calculus and did fine.
Yup, never took freshman calculus.<p>When I went to graduate school, I took a problem
with me and had an intuitive solution.  My first
year had some good courses (one was just terrific,
from a star student of E. Cinlar now long at
Princeton) and gave me what I needed to turn my
intuitive solution into a solid math solution; I did
that in my first summer, independently; and that was
the research for my Ph.D.<p>I continued that way in my career:  E.g., in a
software house working for the US DoD, I saw a
problem in a specification, got Blackman and Tukey,
'The Measurement of Power Spectra', and read it
carefully enough to see what was wrong with the
specification and how to fix it.  Right:  without
courses, lectures, problem sessions, ....<p>As far as I can tell, nearly all the technical
content on HN, StackOverflow and other Internet fora
is from people who taught themselves in similar ways
with little or nothing in courses, lectures, problem
sessions, ....  And that's part of what researchers
have to do and is just part of getting tenure as a
research professor.<p>So, since so much work is being done by essentially
independent study now, just by not making things
worse on-line courses should be able to look
successful.<p>But I see some problems with the on-line materials I
tried:<p>(1) The video quality just sucked.  I couldn't read
the board.  That meant I couldn't copy what was on
the board and study it.  Bummer.<p>(2) The sound quality was not good enough.<p>(3) The course materials, e.g., on paper or in PDF
files, were from not good enough down to just
missing.<p>(4) Sadly the quality of the course content was too
low; apparently the main reason was the desire to
make the course more 'appropriate', that is,
'easier', for 'the common man in the street'.  But,
omitting material 'waters down' the course content
and, really, for a good student, requires that they
fill in the gaps for themselves -- bummer.<p>E.g., I looked at the course by Stanford professor
Ng on 'Machine Learning'.  What I saw were
weaknesses (1)-(4) above.  For more, (A) a lot that
he was doing was maximum likelihood estimation but
with far too little explanation and justification;
so, I would have had to have run off and studied
maximum likelihood estimation on my own.  So, again
I was on my own to do some independent work,
trusting Professor Ng that somehow maximum
likelihood estimation was better than it has long
seemed in the statistics community.  (B) He
mentioned the 'maximization' to be done via
following gradients, and that is an overly
simplistic and not very promising approach to
maximization -- the standard, first problem is that
spend nearly all the computing time moving in
directions nearly orthogonal to the direction really
should be moving in.<p>So, from (A) and (B), I concluded that for a good
course I would have had to have taken his lectures
just as topics to be investigated, gone to good
materials elsewhere, collected good details, and
written my own text.  That's his job as a professor,
not my job as a student.  His field, 'machine
learning', didn't look worth that much work for me
now.  I've done some serious work in several cases
of applied math that could be called 'machine
learning' as much as his material, and I'm left
without much respect for his material.<p>I looked at the course 'Probabilistic Graphical
Models' taught by Daphne Koller.  Since I very much
liked a course by a star student of E. Cinlar, maybe
I should like Kollar's course.  Sorry, I didn't --
the quality looked too low.  Better quality from
Stanford?  Sure, K. Chung, H. Royden, D. Luenberger
(his 'Optimization by Vector Space Methods' is a
beautifully, even elegantly, done one mile long
applied math dessert buffet), D. Knuth.<p>For courses in 'how to code', that is, introductory
material in software, gotta be kidding!  'Coding'
alone is easy; it's just, pick a language, learn the
basic syntax, and write if-the-else, do-while,
call-return, allocate-free, etc.  It's easy but
doesn't take one very far.  So, don't get very far
with thousands of Web pages of documentation at MSDN
on .NET, ASP.NET, ADO.NET, administration of SQL
Server, IIS, Windows Server, etc. or the equivalent
in the Linux world.<p>I have two broad conclusions:<p>First, traditionally in academic material in
technical subjects, the author and the student
'reached' to each other, and they connected at a
well written textbook.  So, the author went far
enough toward the student to prepare a good text --
and the best texts are terrific.  And the student
reached far enough toward the author to make do with
little or no more than a good text.  It's how I
learned plane geometry, freshman calculus,
theoretical, applied, and numerical linear algebra,
everything I learned about statistics, most of what
I learned about advanced calculus, signal processing
and the FFT, stochastic optimal control, artificial
intelligence, ..., and everything I learned about
software.  E.g., it's heavily what worked for me.<p>The on-line community will have to face the fact of
this 'reaching'.  In effect, on-line learning
requires the professor to do more work of a kind
that promises not to be well rewarded by tenure and
promotion committees.  So, net, so far a student
should still reach mostly for one of the best texts,
on paper or PDF.<p>Second, the situation will 'settle out':  The
professors will come to understand what minimum
quality is needed, and the students will realize
that the learning is not just a spectator sport, is
not like watching a movie, and still requires nearly
all the traditional work from a book or PDF file.
Then the courses will get better; the students just
looking to watch a movie won't sign up; and the
course completion rates will increase.",1364763913

For the other 3 I downloaded the material, got some exercises on sites like MIT OCW, and finished them at my own pace.",1364763671

Like econ classes, engineering, science, or similar.<p>This was good because it was short bursts of information without any hassle, commitment, and similar.<p>These days everyone has locked their content behind sign up/registration pages, and you're expected to commit to a tradition semester of a class in order to get a worthless certificate of completion.<p>They also dictate the speed at which you learn. No more learning at your own pace, no, you have to do one a week for as many weeks as it goes on for like it was a traditional class.<p>And why? Why indeed. Why is online education simulating University education when it actually has no relationship to it? You aren't getting a University qualification by completing a ""class,"" there is no reason why a ""class"" has to be X number of weeks or you should have to complete the rereq's in order to take it.<p>Places like Khan Academy have got this right. I can go to Khan Academy right now, click on a video series, watch a few bites of information and then stop when I'm ready/bored. Coursera's class system is just pointless, stressful, and annoying.<p>If Coursera was transferable then it would absolutely make sense to do. But that doesn't look likely and while that isn't the case they're just making access to learning material more difficult with no obvious benefit to anyone.",1364763650

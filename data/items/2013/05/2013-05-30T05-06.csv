I'd LOVE the thing even more if I could submit projects of my own as a Canadian, which I can't do for now, but that's not the subject of the present post. What worries me are shipping fees. The fact that so few project creators realizes that there are 2 levels of USPS international service with 2 very different cost levels involved: shipping to Canada and International. Please consider offering a lower than regular international shipping fee for Canadians on your next Kickstarter campaign. Or do as others and include Canada as your free shipping zone.

But it's a total of 20 lines or so, so I'll likely post an example soon :)<p>So React has a very low degree of coupling to the browser. Specifically it has two phases:<p>1. Generate the HTML markup, giving each DOM node a unique ID<p>2. Attach top-level event handlers. When an event fires we look at the target ID to figure out which component to bubble to (we have normalized, cross-browser bubbling and capturing built into our synthetic event system).<p>In client-rendered apps we run both of these on the client. For server rendered apps, we initialize and only generate markup on the server and send it down. Then on the client we re-initialize, but notice that the markup is there so we just attach event handlers.<p>This system enabled us to build a prototype a while back that ran React entirely in a web worker, but we haven't had time to productionize that yet.",1369893070

The design <i>is</i> beautiful, but I don't see why that would be an artifact of mass-production. The early prototypes for Glass were much sexier in terms of build integrity (optics, for example) than the current mass-produced models. One of the big challenges, in fact, was lowering expenses for mass-producibility. However, yes, the design is wonderfully intelligent. You'll notice some optical tricks when you look at Glass. For example, you'll see as if the frame takes up a portion of the sides, but in reality, there is circuitry hidden behind it--by looking at it you'd never know :)<p><i>The interface is not intuitive. It is actually very difficult to use the first time, for seemingly no reason. ... I would have expected more design attention to have been spent on interacting with the software.</i><p>I really feel this is a non-issue. Yes, you don't know how to use it when you first get it, but after a few instructions from a friend, I navigated the entire interface just fine for about an hour without needing additional help. Mostly, I just had to learn about the well-disguised touchpad. I've used a lot of silly software and hardware, and Glass is <i>not</i> one of them. It's a new product class, and it's going to have a new interface.<p><i>Glass doesn't communicate with you very much, and when it does, it doesn't use audio. It makes heavy use of the screen when possible. When navigating Glass, you can rarely speak selections. The only way to fully navigate the interface is to use the touchpad by holding your hand up near your face.</i><p>Navigation is definitely an issue. However, the Glass team planned on external devices being used to navigate Glass. Once Thalmic's MYO is fully operational, I don't think navigation will be much of a problem.<p><i>The battery life is dreadful. After ten minutes of use, the battery level reported went down by at least 8%. The owner told me that it would probably last about two hours with constant use. (This is hopefully a temporary handicap that will be improved in the future, but I find it hard to consider even this level of battery life good enough for a device that is sold.)</i><p>This is supposed to be fixed. Especially if you use video recording, the battery will drain really quickly. The idea by final product, is to have it last about 12 hours with passive use (kind of like a cell phone).",1369892324

Even the simple-looking stuff took a lot to produce.<p>Those plain sandals on the floor? They needed three different looms for the three kinds of fabric, plus whatever kind of molder is used for the rubber sole. And sewing machines in various configurations.<p>That tea kettle? It needs to be made of parts that can withstand extreme heat. It's got a copper bottom and steel sides, plus a handle that must be made of some kind of heat-resistant plastic.<p>That briefcase? Fake leather (however that's made), steel hardware of various sorts, and zippers. All hooked together with riveters, sewing machines, and other tools.<p>Most items you own are the result of a large number of industrial processes. There's an amazingly intricate web of raw materials producers and manufacturers behind nearly everything. Conceivably, some or many of these processes could be replaced with printing, but that's not even on the horizon at this point.<p>To be more specific, I see big challenges in printing materials with the right properties: flexibility, tensile strength, etc.. There's a reason we use so many different materials in today's products.<p>And then there are the challenges of printing electrical devices. Many of these involve quite a few materials, such as copper, silver, gold, tungsten, and on and on. Many also involve a high degree of miniaturization (I'm thinking of chips here).",1369890640

On the flip side, founders find it very hard to stand out amidst the deluge of job offers to attract workers to their companies.<p>More high-skill immigrants would probably lead to more available jobs for natives, as more companies could find the labor they need to grow.<p>A low-skill immigration increase isn't necessary, and may hurt the Americans without a college degree who are already suffering in this economy from high levels of unemployment.

It was too far outside my wheelhouse to go ahead with, but I really think something like this will blow up and become a big part of the future of podcasting.<p>One difference between this and my idea was that instead of filters I was thinking the app would have ""recipies""... The app could break up your recording into sections with prompts. I.e. if you want to tell a story you start by recording an introduction, then the body of the story, and then a conclusion. The app could then interleave music or other ambient audio into the recording to create a richer audio experience.<p>Fundamentally Instagram was successful because it made it easy to take good photos. Or easy to make bad photos better. I think when someone figures out how to make bad audio good, they'll crack this field wide open. Of course I wish you all the best of luck, but I am a bit skeptical that audio filters are the right formula for this.",1369890200

291282,comment,290954,291134,0,0,davidw,,,"> The DMCA is screwing a ton of potential music startups. Tipjoy is in a ridiculously regulated space of finance. Plenty of YC startups get screwed by immigration laws.<p>Like I said below, those are pretty good examples, but ""America's small businesses"" are not primarily comprised of that sort of thing.  I guess I just reacted to the blanket ""government is the problem"" statement, which I feel is inaccurate.  It's certainly <i>a</i> problem, but not <i>the</i> problem for most businesses.  It's also a source of many benefits for businesses, such as an educated workforce, infrastructure, enforcement of contracts, but that's getting into an extremely long, drawn out and complicated argument: ""the ideal level of government"", that is guaranteed to go nowhere.  I think we can all agree that certain things ought to be streamlined, though.",1220170364

There might be a few: the Estonian corporate tax is supposed to be pretty good; the UK and Ireland aren't as expensive as continental Europe, but by and large, I stand by my statement.",1220169615

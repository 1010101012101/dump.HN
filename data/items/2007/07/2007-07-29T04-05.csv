The further they take it away from being a good language for multi-processor machines the further away it is from being useful.<p>With the death of Von Neumann in sight, at last, Haskell is galloping away from it's biggest selling point to the average pgmr.  I'm starting to think Erlang might become a mainstream language instead of Haskell.  Would sort of prove the need for a language to have a single designer.<p>The sort of things I'd hoped to see in research are :-
    Genetic design of machines with 1000+ simple cpus with multi level communication and storage.
    Proof that the brain works on a quantum level.
    Cyc tied into machine learning so that it auto updates it's rules.
    Rules for understanding complexity from simple components.<p>Basically, I want to see the big problems that are just within grasp tackled.  ",1185684151

Do you want to learn something new (foreign language, to tango, a new programming language, etc)?  Do you want to do something physical (run a marathon, achieve weight lifting goals, swim the English channel,etc).  Do you want to be a philanthropist?  Do you want to run a non-profit organization?  Figure out 3-5 things you want to do.<p>Be is harder IMO.  Do you want to be a husband? father? grand father (you need help on this one obvious)?  Do you want to a champion whatever?  These are the questions I would ask myself.  With the answers, you can start taking concrete steps.",1185682973

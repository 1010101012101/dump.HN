1398,comment,1373,1381,0,0,amichail,,,"I am interested in getting free labor out of users in the style of the espgame.org. For more on this, see: http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8246463980976635143 An obvious step would be to extend the ESP Game to video. Of course, the service need not be a game. For example, consider two groups of people: those who wish to grammar check their documents and those who wish to learn English. To grammar check, one would submit the document and users trying to learn English can try to find errors in it and provide corrections. General agreement about certain sorts of errors might be viewed as making it more likely that those in fact are errors. Moreover, one can also look for agreement among corrections. People learning English would benefit by getting back feedback about how well their errors and corrections correlate with those from others. One could of course do something similar with code design say. ",1172598943

A &#34;no-cache&#34; and an expire header of the submit request page would avoid this problem.",1172598697

1392,comment,1298,1344,0,0,altay,,,"I&#39;d second the Fabrice Grinda recommendation.  It&#39;s obvious just minutes into the interview that he&#39;s a straight-up A-player entrepreneur.  It&#39;s especially interesting because he ISN&#39;T an ideas guy -- rather, he&#39;s a master executor -- but does a great job of playing to his strengths.  He takes proven, innovative ideas and executes the sh*t out of them in new markets (e.g. the eBay of Europe, ringtones in the US, and, currently, Craigslist international).<p>Premal Shah (Kiva) was incredibly, incredibly inspiring.  His interview transforms microfinance from an abstract concept (&#34;oh, that Nobel Prize thing...?&#34;) into something tangible.  Did you know that you can be an angel investor for $25??<p>The Jason Calcanis interview gives you a much more nuanced sense of his character than you get from his blogosphere presence.<p>And though you&#39;ll probably avoid Sharelle Klaus -- what self-respecting tech entrepreneur would care about a SODA company, right? -- I&#39;d urge you to listen, because it was totally fascinating.    It&#39;s refreshing to get outside of the internet-startup echo chamber and realize that, well, entrepreneurship is entrepreneurship.  In other words, there are business fundamentals that apply to any startup, whether it&#39;s on the web or in meatspace.",1172598150
1391,comment,1245,1366,0,0,Alex3917,,,"PageRank works almost exactly the same way as a PKI. The only difference is that instead of people signing your key to vouch that it belongs to you, they are linking to your webpage to vouch that it has quality content. PageRank can be faked, certainly, but it is difficult enough to at least significantly slow someone down. To make it more trustworthy you&#39;d probably have to modify it to create certain webpages that were absolutely trusted, and then do some sort Kevin Bacon rank where end users were scored based on the degrees of separation. That way there is some designated starting point, rather than the whole system being based off popularity.",1172597994
1390,comment,1373,1381,0,0,amichail,,,"I am interested in more intelligent ads. Make the ad so intelligent and interactive that people would want to play with it, just to test its boundaries. Building a better ad now reduces to coming up with the better AI. Taking this further, you might allow people to combine two ads to see how they will interact with each other. For example, you might combine an Apple ad with a Microsoft one to see which AI will win out.",1172597868

1388,comment,1373,1381,0,0,amichail,,,"I&#39;m interested in ways to make more novel startups succeed. The problem here is that the average web surfer has a very short attention span. And so it is hard for anything novel to get much traffic. One possible solution is to try to extend the attention span of the average web surfer much as you would with young children. Namely, present an idea in a cute and funny way.  See for example: http://www.hitachigst.com/hdd/research/recording_head/pr/PerpendicularAnimation.html .  By extending their attention span in this way, you might be able to get them to understand and appreciate your novel service.",1172597401
1387,comment,1373,1381,0,0,amichail,,,"I&#39;m interested in showing people data that they don&#39;t normally see. I mentioned VNCCasts in another post. Another example would be to show the web traffic at a web site to everyone in real-time. This might be done using something like http://www.visitorville.com/. Or maybe you would show actual sessions in progress. But whatever you do, the point is to make the site look more active and interesting. It&#39;s a way to promote the site.",1172597124
1386,comment,1298,1298,0,0,altay,,,"Yes, Venture Voice rocks.  Greg is a really great interviewer, and the interviewees are super interesting. <p>This is one of the most consistent sources of entrepreneurial inspiration I&#39;ve found, up there with PG&#39;s essays and Jessica&#39;s book (Founders at Work).<p>The interviews are long, in sharp contrast to all the fast-food info you&#39;ll find through social news sites like this one.  But if you&#39;re passionate about entrepreneurship, I can guarantee that taking a long walk with one of these interviews will be good for your career and for your soul.<p>(In case anyone&#39;s wary of my effusing, I&#39;ve got no connection to VV, just a big fan.)",1172597045
1385,comment,1373,1381,0,0,amichail,,,"I&#39;m interested in understanding people more deeply and learning from them by watching what they do and how they think. One idea that I tried is a service for broadcasting your computer screen, just as if it were a TV show. See my work on VNCCasts: http://www.mobuzztv.com/uk/shows/vnccast_my_scrap_beckett_sculpture/.  (The report is a bit misleading though as they apparently mistook the sample channels I created as ones actually used by others.)",1172596822
1384,comment,1373,1381,0,0,amichail,,,"I&#39;m interested in a service for creating or inventing things in a collaborative way. For example, consider using human-based genetic algorithms to create daily news shows, perhaps in the style of this site: http://www.newsatseven.com (but using people rather than computers).  As another example, one might build a service where users invent board games. Again, this could be done using human-based genetic algorithms. Users of the service would be able to modify rules to try to make a game more fun. A fitness function would take into account how popular various game variants are among players. Note that users of such a service need not be programmers: the domain is sufficiently restricted so as to make visual point-and-click rule creation/modification possible.",1172596336
1383,comment,1373,1381,0,0,amichail,,,"I&#39;m interested in ways to make people scale. For example, one might imagine a service that allows people to construct a chatbot for themselves that they could unleash onto the net to spread their views. Yet another possibility is to have such a chatbot constructed in a collaborative way by many people. The interaction between such chatbots is also interesting. For example, you could have an online dating site where you can go on thousands of dates per day by having your chatbot interact with other chatbots. Promising interactions can then be brought to your attention and you may then decide to go on a real date. ",1172596184

Also see: http://groups.google.com/group/forwarding-tree. Note that personalization is just another way to control spam. One might imagine an extension of the social network approach used that would apply to discussion forums for example, even at the level of individual threads/posters. How would you personalize a discussion and yet still retain something that is coherent?<p>I&#39;ll present some other ideas here soon.",1172595786

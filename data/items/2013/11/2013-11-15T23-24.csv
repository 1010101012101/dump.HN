You&#x27;re the first person to ask specifically about this feature, which is good motivation to take it off the back burner :-).<p>In the meantime, you can accomplish this by storing the git-crypt key in the repository, but encrypted using GPG with multiple recipients (much like your approach).  Then you wrap `git-crypt init` in a script that first decrypts the key using GPG before feeding it to `git-crypt init`.  To add a new developer, you just re-encrypt the git-crypt key with an additional recipient.",1384559905

6742887,comment,6740999,6742726,4,0,jnbiche,,,">Could you elaborate?<p>A major source of complexity, in my opinion, are the different pointers: owned pointers, managed pointers, borrowed pointers (mutable and immutable), each with its own syntax and rules for use.  And all three seem to be everywhere.  I actually understand pointers in C (mostly!), yet I struggle to remember all the use cases for pointers in Rust.  Here&#x27;s the tutorial on just borrowed pointers:
<a href=""http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/tutorial-borrowed-ptr.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/master/tutorial-borrowed-ptr...</a>
I&#x27;m sure I could understand learn the rules given some time, but now that I&#x27;ve played around with D and Nimrod, I&#x27;m wondering why I should. I can get excellent performance without using pointers, yet I can access a pointer if I absolutely need one.<p>>So I don&#x27;t think you can really make an unqualified statement like that.<p>I agree that unqualified statements about the relative performances of language implementations are tenuous, and so I retract that statement.  But it&#x27;s clear that Nimrod can reach ballpark C++/Rust/Go speeds, even without GC specifically turned off, based on both my own usage and this benchmark:<p>1. <a href=""http://togototo.wordpress.com/2013/08/23/benchmarks-round-two-parallel-go-rust-d-scala-and-nimrod/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://togototo.wordpress.com/2013/08/23/benchmarks-round-tw...</a><p>Now, it&#x27;s quite possible that we&#x27;re not getting optimal performance out of Rust because we&#x27;re not writing idiomatic Rust, but this hurdle is at least partly a function of my first point.<p>EDIT:  I should add that I think Rust may well find itself in a very strong position among systems and embedded programmers, given the fine control and safety it offers.  But for your average programmer just looking for a faster language to use when Python or Ruby won&#x27;t suffice, Nimrod (and D with shared library support) is a very nice alternative.",1384559804

6742884,comment,6742306,6742306,1,0,pasquinelli,,,"i don&#x27;t remember where this idea originally came from, but programming languages aren&#x27;t tools that you build programs with, they&#x27;re the materials out of which you build programs. no material is best suited for use in every structure. the combination of different materials in the same structure could also have catastrophic effects. so, if you know a programming language really well and you build all your programs out of it, there&#x27;ll be times that you&#x27;re causing yourself difficulty. but, if you use all of and only those languages that are as perfectly suited to the many problems that your program has to solve, you may end up with a brittle program through effects too indirect to see. or, the combination of materials could have other unforeseen effects, like maybe it dissolves living tissue.",1384559760

Good on Popehat and other sites for spreading the word about how scummy that company is. (By the way, the title of the submission here is misleading, and is not the original blog post title.

But when those reports are fraudulent, as here, the consumer can also dispute the report, and the consumer should be able to come out with a clean credit record in the end. MANY years ago, my wife ordered a product by mail order, and we discovered the product was defective, and returned it. The company still wanted to bill us, and sent us a letter threatening to report us to a credit agency if we didn&#x27;t pay. I simply wrote that the product was defective and that we had returned it and we disputed the company&#x27;s point of view on the company&#x27;s demand letter, and sent that back by return mail. That was the end of the matter, back in those days. We have a very clean credit history. I speak my mind whenever I think I have been ripped off.",1384559730

What you need to see is how many companies if any have been mentioned in the same space doing similar things.  If you find some, it means you are already 2-3 years behind in the game.  Then the key question is how you can differentiate?<p>2.  It is not only about how may people you can interview. Sometimes you may be able to interview the segment you want but they might not understand if the product or service you are going to offer is going to be a game changer.  For example, I was chatting with a friend in 2005 about how people were using a PC because we were looking buy some PC related stocks.  Our observation was that most of the people  are using them to browse the web.  Netbooks were not there yet and there were no signs of iPhone and the iPad.   If you were to interview consumer at that point or even tried fundraising from VCs, they were pretty happy with the PC they had and there was no need for an iPad.  But if you look today - iPad is what everyone wants to buy today.  Similarly Facebook and Instagram or Facebook and Snapchat.  What Instagram did or Snapchat is doing - was/is already being done on the Facebook except the differentiators weren&#x27;t there.<p>3.  While the market research is a must, your idea shall not completely depend on it.  Instead the focus should be on what problem your trying to solve and the market for it - e.g. for iPad it was a need for small and portable device that can be used to browse web and manage daily digital activities.  For Snapchat - teenagers wish to keep their affairs separate than their parents since Facebook let everyone in.<p>4.  Startups are about creating new markets the data you may not be able to find from the research companies or the government databases.  In my humble opinion, most of the research companies look into the rearview mirror to determine the road ahead.",1384558696

One interesting note is that Phabricator has moved away from using only
rebasing by default for landing git branches. See this commit (
<a href=""https://secure.phabricator.com/D4080"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.phabricator.com/D4080</a> ) for the full story, but now Phabricator
lets your dev team use `git merge` while developing feature branches. When you
run `arc land`, your master is merged in to your feature branch (forcing you to
resolve all conflicts) and then your feature branch is squash-merged in to
master. If your developers like to collaborate on the same branch (pushing and
pulling from the same remote,) not having to worry about rebasing is nice. At
the end, phabricator turns all of your intermediary steps into one commit
anyway so who cares what&#x27;s going on before then?",1384558503

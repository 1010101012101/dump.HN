Im sure I saw a paper draft this time last week you posted :D well done.<p>Secondly give us some indication of what it's about ;)<p>Oh got a third: you might want ot have a simple form on the page to submit and email address too - sending an actual email to get in on the alpha might put people off!",1245488258

The main benefit of doing it ""together"" (under some kind of agreement) is that in the future if it becomes a full company I will be leaving (as I have a career) we have agreed that part of our signed agreement will include a pay off for me (probably in the region of a percentage of the first 2 years income - he said 50%.[lets split 50/50 all the way]... which seems very high :P)<p>Anyway - thanks for the comments. Im sold on this approach over an LLP so I'll pitch it to him in our meeting next week :D",1245488038

666281,comment,666096,666266,0,0,lsc,,,"heh.   Yeah, hiring managers like you are why I make a lot more than friends who are several standard deviations more intelligent than i am, who show up on time more often, and who get more work done.<p>But I'm tall, blond, confident and can be fairly friendly in person, so I get more money.   It's  stupid, because I'm not getting more done.  I'm not providing more value.  In fact, the confidence is a major negative, when it comes to real value.   I take on tasks I can't handle, and routinely underestimate how long a particular task will take.<p>If you can't communicate your ideas in writing, you are unfit for management.  You are unfit to write specifications, and you are probably unfit to implement those specifications.<p>I'm in business for myself now precisely because I can't stand to work for semi-literate morons who choose me over people who are clearly superior to me just because I wasn't looking at my shoes during the interview.",1245487788

666279,comment,664954,665939,0,0,ErrantX,,,"Thanks - as you say the split is something Im not worried about. The income generated will be about Â£1500 a month for me (based on the current work lined up - should be sustainable) which is about a third of my current salary. The idea is this will be my savings money so it's not ""on the line"" in terms of need. I have nothing invested (and am very easy going anyway) so I cant see the downsides.<p>I could probably get a 60/40 split but the other guy would be a bit miffed (it's his baby and he is all enthusiastic). The money I get seems pretty fair for my time (even if it seems extremely generous to him) so.... :D<p>I think the impression I got is he is looking for this to be the start of his ""something big"". Essentially I am helping him get that off the ground - the deal is if it is ""big"" and turns into an actual company employing more programmers I will be leaving with a pay off for my initial ""investment of time"" (that figure is still to be agreed on - but will be) as I have a career to pursue anyway.<p>I cant see the downside to a couple of years doing this for income on the side - it's all good experience :D<p>Thanks for your comments! You've made me confident I am doign the right thing :D",1245487708

666270,comment,666255,666255,0,0,muhamm,,,"This article says that since 1965 the return on assets for US corporations has dropped by 75% while the biggest additions to the asset base over the same period have been hardware and software. The first question this seems to raise is what are we actually measuring when we look at return on assets - does it take into account the fact that your customers view your brand more positively because your IT has made your company more responsive to the customer? Because that change could actually reduce your advertising costs and not end up in any metric. And the second question is whether most companies are just investing in technology to automate existing processes or are really reorganizing the way they do business around their IT so that they can fully leverage all of the potential benefits of their IT. Of course that takes a degree of understanding of IT that many older executives simply do not have.",1245486921

This doesn't mean that face to face communication is not also essential to a good working relationship. There are some things which are just impossible to sort out via text chat - the potential for misunderstandings is just too great.<p>Personally, I would hesitate to hire someone who is <i>not</i> a ""well-rounded"" person.

666264,comment,666096,666096,0,0,timwiseman,,,"I partially agree with much of what he is saying.  As a hiring manager looking over resumes, I cared nothing at all for things that were not at all connected with the job.  But I was very interested in things that were tangentially related.<p>For instance, I hired mostly MS Sql Server/C# developers, but having python on the resume indicated they had a broader base within programming (and also that they probably learned on their own beyond what was needed just for the job.)  The same with having Oracle or MySql on the resume along with SQL Server, it showed a broader base in related technologies.<p>Also, I was very interested in someone with good face to face communication skills.  Most of our software was used in-house so the primary users often spoke with the primary developers face to face and a lack of ability to interact that way was awkward at the best.",1245486529

The ""make mibbit OS"" were either jokes or a precursor to explaining why they prefer their client.<p>There seems to be a bit of miscommunication between mibbit and freenode here, where freenode believes that they tried extensively over at least a year to resolve this with mibbit and mibbit says they had no clue. I'd certainly be suspicious and not necessarily feel welcome to forgiving immediately if something like that happened.<p>And as for trust - I don't know either group. But from the patient way in which the freenode staffers explained what was happening and their rationale to everyone who entered #freenode to demand their mibbit back for (I think) the better part of twelve hours, that leaves me with far more respect for them than for axod at the moment, assuming certain things about his actions fit together like it seems.",1245485792

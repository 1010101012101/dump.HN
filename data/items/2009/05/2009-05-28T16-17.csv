630563,comment,630093,630524,0,0,volida,,,"Touch screen is a very broad concept. It has been applied in numerous devices.<p>In the meaning of being available in a mobile, yes iPhone may lead currently, but I wouldn't consider a phone that has a price tag 900 euro to be considered mainstream, just because 17 million people (as zimbabwe sais above) have bought it.<p>My point of view is that in mobile phones, Nokia will be the one to take it mainstream as their strategy has always been various phones models and cheap ones.<p>However, since Windows will be supporting touch screen and Windows is 90% of the market, obviously Microsoft will put touch screen in a lot more hands than Apple.<p>Since no one can predict what will happen, this remains just speculation. But my point is you can't consider mainstream something that only few can access, at least currently.",1243529922
630561,story,,,2,2,jalammar,"Ask HN: Giving Equity to Early Employees/Late Cofounders",,"A couple of years ago, I began developing a web application with the intent of it becoming a startup when it's ready. It was launched about a year ago. I worked alone on the whole thing, and used the help of a freelancer in some aspects. 4 months ago, I saw that it was time to start getting serious about it. I gathered a team of 6 people to help work on the site (2 developers, 3 to help with moderation and content, and one to undertake publicity). What I proposed to them (since it's a bootstrapped startup with no real funding) is that whoever logs 100 hours of work in the next 6 months will earn a share in the company worth the ratio of their hours of effort to the effort hours of the rest of the team. (I have already logged about 1300 hours working on it, so if they log 100 hours each, the pot will be 1900 hours, so each of them would get about %5, leaving about 70% for me, the founder).<p>(a possible alternative is to substitute ""hours"" with ""work units"" so that things like development would have more value than things like forum moderation...etc)<p>I came up with this kind of deal because I wanted 1) the dedication of of a team that feels ownership in the venture 2) each of them to prove their dedication to the new company (by passing the the proposed threshold of effort).<p>Is this fair way to do things? is it wise? So far it's only a verbal agreement on a vague idea along these lines, but I want to resolve this issue and finalize it now.",1243529867

The few things that homeowners do care about have special purpose controllers: heating, irrigation, perimeter lighting.  I see no need to fire up my computer to turn on the furnace when I can walk over to the thermostat.  If I want really fancy control, I buy a really fancy thermostat.  My coffee maker has a timer, so if I want coffee at 7am, I can set it.  At the same time I can  check the coffee and the water level.  Computer control would buy me nothing since I still have to check the coffee and water.<p>The one time I thought about controls was when I had to replace a leaking skylight in a cathedral ceiling.

I'd bet that most people who know about it have had a chance to fiddle around with it, since they've sold 17 million phones and I-don't-know-how-many iPod touches. It's inspired a slew of touch-based competitors from every major phone provider.<p>I would bet more people use multitouch every day than use Windows Vista's app switcher that tiles and cycles windows, which Microsoft featured prominently in every Vista ad as an example of advanced technology. I'll further bet that this touch technology takes longer to catch on in the laptop market than you think. Remember that touch screens already <i>do</i> exist in laptops, and they're not that popular because they're bad. I'll add one last bet, which is that, if the reviews of the Surface are accurate, Microsoft is incapable of making a touch screen interface that's enjoyable to use and so people will stick to using mice and touch pads.",1243529489

What about when it slows down due to unforeseen spike in traffic? They haven't talked about the backup options, which scares me.""<p>Since they are using CSS font mechanisms (I think), it will depend on what the CSS engine does. If it completely can't get a font, presumably it'll use the same fallback rules it already uses when you call for a font that isn't there. The interesting question is what exactly the browsers do for such fonts, but my guess is that they would be treated exactly like a script tag in the header, adding something that would have to be downloaded before the page will even begin to render. But, further presumably, the JS they provide and the fonts will be properly labeled with cache control headers so they don't hit the host server on every page load.<p>See how Yahoo serves their YUI stuff: <a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/hosting/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/hosting/</a>",1243529455

It's surprising to see people promoting arc with this approach.<p>But reading your post closely, you're saying that blub strictly only refers to <i>people who believe their language is the best and others are no good.</i> In the avg.html article, it also says ""How can you get anything done in Blub? It doesn't even have y."" and talks about people looking down on less powerful languages. Therefore, a person programming in Java (or assembly or whatever) isn't a blub programmer unless he believes that language is the best, that others are no good, and he looks down on less powerful languages (maybe a more accurate word for this attitude is ""snob"".)

From the videos I've seen, it doesn't look as intuitive as the iPhone.<p>As for games, I can say that I've never played a native OSX game in my 6 years of using Macs.  However, I have an entire page of games on my iPhone.  They wouldn't be a deal breaker for me but they're pretty nifty to have around and the power of the SDK allows them to be much more sophisticated on the iPhone than the Pre.<p>I'm also not convinced that the Pre is a business smartphone.  It seems heavily designed as a consumer product.<p>Your comment on the quantity of applications is misguided.  Palm OS and Windows Mobile never had the popularity that the App Store does.  The App Store changed the mobile app distribution game completely.  Your comment on Blackberry and Nokia ""outselling"" the iPhone is also a bit silly.  The Blackberry Curve was the #1 smartphone but they were also selling them as a 2 for 1 deal and on multiple carriers.  And if you account for all RIMM models, of course they're going to have a larger share.  They have multiple models on every carrier.  What the iPhone has done as a single phone on a single carrier has not be duplicated and the Pre certainly won't be the one that matches its success.<p>Also being a game-changer may not matter in the long-term.  However, for a company like Palm that doesn't have a lot of money and is essentially going ""all-in"" with Web O/S, the short term is much more relevant.  This company was essentially done with until the Pre was announced and they needed a substantial investor to come in to finance the launch of the Pre.

I think this is how it might work:<p>1.) Check the site referrer to ensure that fonts from Typekit are only delivered to websites that have purchased the font (or are signed up for the free fonts).<p>Of course since there aren't any drm protections, you can simply take the font file and put it on your own site, which leads to....<p>2.) They might have custom Typekit versions of well-known fonts, so that if any website is self-hosting a font file that is from Typekit, it's plainly obvious they're doing it illegally. Also, if a type foundry only licensed their font to Typekit for web embedding, then any hosting of their font on a site other than Typekit is forbidden.<p>This is different than how it would work now, because let's assume that a type foundry licensed fonts for embedding on websites. It becomes very hard for them to search the web finding their embedded fonts and then checking their records to make sure the person who created the site actually purchased a license. This would take a lot of time and effort that these type foundries don't have. However, if the font is only licensed to be hosted by Typekit, then Typekit can do the checking and accept reports of other sites infringing, etc. It just makes the whole effort easier because only one website will have the license to self-host that font.<p>So to me, the biggest downside is that you have to have your font files hosted on a 3rd party service. Also, they claim you'll embed the fonts via javascript, whereas if you were self-hosting your own fonts there's no need for javascript at all.<p>I wish the type foundries would just get over the fact that some people may commit copyright infringement on their fonts. Instead they should just provide all of us honest people the ability to purchase a license to embed fonts on our websites instead of constantly trying to find drm'ish ways of fighting it.",1243528559

VCR's blinking ""12:00"" was the joke of the 90's, and the concept is still true today, even if VCR's don't really exist anymore.<p>Can you imagine the average person wanting to program an HA system?  Telling it when to turn lights on and off, how to factor in shifting sunrise/sunset times, occupancy sensors and the like?  It's very very difficult to make a system that is both powerful and simple, unless you break it down to a very very basic function.<p>Most people would love an automated home experience, but the setup is daunting.  Especially when you consider all the edge cases... Turn on the interior lights at 30 minutes before dusk, but not if we're away or out.  Shut off the HVAC system or zone if a window is open, unless the door to that room is closed or the humidity is very high (like in a bathroom), and so on.<p>I have personally found that if you don't carry the system logic far enough, it is just annoying and perceived as ""stupid"".  In order to make the system very intelligent it needs to be rather complex and incorporate a lot of environmental (temperature, humidity, occupancy, seasonal, etc) inputs.<p>Heave on top of all that there is no one system that covers all the basic sub-functions really well:
- Phone<p>- Security<p>- Lighting<p>- HVAC<p>- Irrigation<p>- A/V (multi-room or single room).<p>- User Interface (remote controls, keypads, input/control panels, etc.).<p>There are a some systems that do a couple of these well.  HAI OmniPro alarm systems do a pretty good job with security, HVAC and lighting.  Their audio is passable, but not great, and their irrigation is kind of lacking.<p>The JDS Stargate is kind of outdated, but does a good job with lighting and basic I/O (relays, TTL inputs, etc.).  It has no security, but integrates with Interlogix alarm panels.  But, you pretty much have to program both devices independently.<p>Russound makes great multi-room audio, and they have a robust serial interface, but not much direct plug-and-play capabilities.<p>All of the various sub-systems seem to almost, but not quite, talk to each other.<p>I've personally moved to an OSX based system (Indigo) and do apple-scripting to handle a lot of things.<p>In the past, I had a JDS Stargage, HAI OmniPro, and PC running an application I wrote to handle email, web and IM interfacing to the Internet, plus some PIC-based stuff I build for other one-off sensors and interfaces to things.<p>My stuff works well, and most people can use and understand it, but this is the result of no small bit of effort and many custom bits...<p>Not exactly joe-consumer friendly.<p>As for MS-home, they've been in and out of this space for 10 years.

Once we leave the world of a monolithic RDBM server there are a lot of variables that come into play.  If database X is network-bound when distributed across multiple hosts and database Y bottlenecks on disk i/o then you are going to get completely different results for each depending on the hardware and network layout/infrastructure of each test cluster.  Each system probably also has a large batch of configuration options that can influence the results depending on how much information about the cluster can be provided to the storage system.  Unless you have a dedicated cluster that you intend on running the tests on I would remove this section.  A potentially better option would be to just have a table that lists the best-case and worst-case environments for each system.

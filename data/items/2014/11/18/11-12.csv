What I mean is, that every other month, I&#x27;m seeing a case of &quot;Uber-for-X&quot;, like Blowhorn, is a startup that claims to be uber for mini-trucks.<p>What is happening is that, UBER is still going through its real challenge and hasn&#x27;t established itself as a household name, like Microsoft, Apple, Google. Lot of people are still critical of its intent (including me perhaps), and its ultimate success, but these small startups that are piggybacking on its name are making matter&#x27;s worse.<p>Most of these Uber for X startups, are not going to succeed, generally speaking, and when a start-up fails, brand value gets hit as people associate &quot;failure&quot; &quot;didn&#x27;t work&quot; &quot;not so good&quot; with that name.

Without further ado, then, a dated but parallel quote in the British tradition.<p><i>I felt I was moving among two groups [literary intellectuals and scientists] comparable in intelligence, identical in race, not grossly different in social origin, earning about the same incomes, who had almost ceased to communicate at all, who in intellectual, moral and psychological climate had so little in common that instead of going from Burlington Hom or South Kensington to Chelsea, one might have crossed an ocean.</i> — Baron C.P.

I published two apps recently which can serve as the content for the course (2 separate courses because one is more advanced than the other). Here are the apps:<p>1) PERC - https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/perc/id907292964\nPerc is an anonymous photo sharing app, a-la Yik-Yak with pictures. I developed it over a period of about 10 days in August and released it in September. It didn’t catch on with the college crowd so now it’s a portfolio app. Perc is the easier of the two apps because there are no user accounts, no registrations or logins. There is no web component either.<p>2) RADIUS - https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mercurymq-radius/id926659377\nI just released Radius over the weekend. It’s an app for finding local jobs of the beer-money variety: babysitting, dog walking, painting etc. Radius is much more advanced than Perc. There is user registration, a web app where users can manage their profiles, push notifications, SMS notifications (via Twilio), and other stuff. For the frontend, I used Angular and the backend is on App Engine, same as Perc.<p>COURSE PROPOSAL\nI&#x27;m trying to gauge the level of interest in a video series which will cover literally every line of code I wrote to create these apps (2 separate series, one for each). I will go through the entire project in Xcode and the backend in Google App Engine. For the Radius series, I will incorporate the work I did on the front end using AngularJS. Each course would cost $50 and consist of probably 25-30 videos (one hour each). On the videos, I will literally recreate the app and narrate what I did and why. I would also include downloadable code samples.\nIf you think this is a good idea, let me know in the comments. If enough people do, than I will set up the landing page and signups for the course, etc and get the ball rolling. Thanks!",1416309573

Muscle memory remembers where the icon for Chrome is and if it moves then I have to look for it.<p>Also the list looks like it should scroll, because it has so few items on it, but dragging upwards draws an &#x27;l&#x27;.<p>I only use a few apps - email, phone, browser, settings and twitter client.

9571415,comment,9570301,9571025,0,0,geebee,,,"Thanks for your response.<p>I feel ambivalence about the use of &quot;engineering&quot; in software.  We do have &quot;sound engineers&quot; and &quot;special effects engineers&quot;, consistent with a vernacular use of engineering to mean &quot;the ingenious use of technology&quot; (made up by me).  Within that context, the term software &quot;engineering&quot; really isn&#x27;t especially outrageous.  I think that the public is not threatened by this use of the word, since they are not confused by the difference between a sound &quot;engineer&quot; and a licensed structural engineer.  However, software &quot;engineering&quot; could slip into that grey area.<p>One thing that makes me worry less is the restructuring of the FE exams to reflect the body of knowledge in the various fields.  For instance, Industrial Engineering is now substantially different from Mechanical even at the FE level.  Another interesting thing I learned is that certain fields are just title based - I believe that this means you can&#x27;t represent yourself as an &quot;Industrial Engineer&quot; in a professional context if you aren&#x27;t a PE, but there isn&#x27;t a practice restriction (at least that is how I interpreted it, because I don&#x27;t do either it doesn&#x27;t really affect me).<p>But one other thing I would like to mention - while I phrased my argument in the context of not wanting PE to gain control over software licensing, I do agree with you about the term &quot;engineering&quot;.  I do agree that you should have a background in those things you mentioned to be using the title where &quot;engineer&quot; implies this sort of background, and it is hard earned.<p>So I&#x27;d agree that software engineers may be grabbing a title they don&#x27;t really have rights to, though I would still argue that software has far more in common with math (even math theory, like abstract algebra) than heat and mass transfer.<p>Oh one more thing - your description for the intended use of &quot;software engineering&quot; as &quot;formally trained engineers who are working on software-intensive projects&quot; sounds reasonable - it covers software for specific engineering systems.  My worry is of scope creep - the initial process is limited, highly relevant, and justified, but it later morphs into an &quot;I&#x27;m licensed and you&quot;re not&quot; situation.  If that happens, I&#x27;d almost want to see some math body establish a degree requirement and math background (including things like abstract algebra and real analysis), along with very intensive algorithm questions, as a counterbalance (au contraire, mon frere, <i>you&#x27;re</i> not licensed).<p>I read Milton Friedman&#x27;s bit on &quot;abolish the AMA&quot; and enjoyed it, but ultimately, I support limited licensing and credentials to protect the public - however, I do feel that scope creep really is a serious risk here.",1432054026

In fact, he was probably one of the more practical academics (if that even makes sense to some people). He advocated top-down, logic-based methods for proving correctness that were based on incrementally transforming a high-level program specification into a final product fit for implementation. He likened it to composing music.<p>He also deeply studied paradigms that were firmly imperative in nature. Besides his work on semaphores for concurrency control, his deductive system of predicate transformer semantics and the Guarded Command Language built on top are some of the most comprehensive notations for imperative languages. He was also on the team that developed ALGOL 60, so it&#x27;s quite likely you owe most languages you&#x27;ve used partially to him.<p>That and your conception of an academic using the analogy of the &quot;Haskell CMS verified by Coq&quot; is largely a straw man, though I can understand why you used it.

Your response here is fascinating! You&#x27;ve introduced an additional dimension that we hadn&#x27;t explored: power<p>Its certainly interesting to compare chartered or regulated professions with software engineering. I share with you opposition to the idea that there should be any body determining who can be called a &#x27;software engineer&#x27;. What might have once been a method of quality control, is now simply a method of constraining labour supply, and thankfully wouldn&#x27;t fly in today&#x27;s open source era.<p>The use of job descriptions as a tool for negotiating space and remit is equally interesting! I can see the value as defensive artefact, though it must be pretty tough to continue to be motivated to work in an environment where such a move would be needed. In reality, I suspect most developers would take advantage of a buoyant market and simply leave before ever a move like this ever required.<p>I think you might under play the risk that job descriptions will not be used aggressively by negative employees. In organisations that have strong employee protections in place, tightly specified job descriptions can be used to the detriment of others. I imagine that certain industries and sectors are often so slow moving precisely because of workers invoke their right not to stray beyond their job description, safe in the knowledge they can then stay behind that signed document and remain immune from management influence.<p>Thanks again for the comment - lots of things to think about!",1432051420

In Rust, if you want to perform a functional update like that you should take the type by move, but almost everyone just uses mutating APIs because mutation is explicit in the signature anyway.  I think that&#x27;s one of the biggest differences in practice between Rust and other MLs (with which it otherwise has a lot in common): in most MLs, mutation is treated as a last resort, while in Rust it&#x27;s extremely common because it (generally) doesn&#x27;t have nonlocal effects.",1432051376

You can designate someone other than the caretaker of the child to be the trustee of the trust if you want to decentralize responsibility, though in our case we found that unnecessary.

The table could have suitable unique constraints to make sure that each player can only complete a goal once.<p>This way, it is much harder for your data to accidentally be modified in a way that it becomes wrong.<p>This also gives you a way to store facts about the completion for free, such as a timestamp for each goal completion.

However, changing IP address is a small potato problem compared to the problems caused by keepalives and NATs.  A device will know when its IPv6 address changes and can re-initiate its TCP connections.

For example, host bypasses nsswitch.conf.<p>(Separately, OS X's stub resolver has some neat tricks. e.g., using /etc/resolver/<domain_name> to route DNS requests for a particular domain to a specific name server.)<p>- I had never heard of <a href=""http://michael.toren.net/code/tcptraceroute/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michael.toren.net/code/tcptraceroute/</a> before. I don't think I've ever encountered a situation where the issue was outbound ICMP/UDP packets being blocked, but rather it's the return ICMP Time Exceeded packets.<p>- 'find . -size +100M' is shorter than 'find ./ -size +100000000c -print'.<p>- ctime is NOT when a file was created, though this is a common misconception. Unix does not record when a file is created. Rather, ctime is the last time the file's status (i.e. inode information aka metadata) was changed. This differs from mtime which records the last time the file's data was changed. ctime is a superset of mtime. atime is the last time a file was accessed, unless the filesystem is mounted with noatime (common for NFS file ssystems). atime/mtime can be set to arbitrary values (permissions allowing) via the utime() system call.<p>- Modern find supports -delete instead of '-exec rm {} \;'. In any case, my muscle memory still defaults to '-print0 | xargs -0 rm'.<p>- 'dd if=/dev/zero of=file.txt count=1024 bs=102' seems like an odd way to do that. I think that 'bs=1024 count=102' might be more efficient depending upon buffering?",1357926110

And as a result, I read more of the page!<p>But the psychological aspect of revealing things can also be done with scrolling, for example the parallax pages such as NikeBetterWorld (now taken down but you can see it at <a href=""http://www.ianlunn.co.uk/demos/recreate-nikebetterworld-parallax/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ianlunn.co.uk/demos/recreate-nikebetterworld-para...</a>) and Ben the Bodyguard and the other sites here: <a href=""http://webdesigncrowd.com/websites-unique-scrolling-adventure/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webdesigncrowd.com/websites-unique-scrolling-adventur...</a><p>As you reveal more of the world in a novel way, you feel a sense of curiosity. Once the novelty wears off, though, you are left right back there with the content.<p>The key to revealing things is that you are more focused on the new stuff instead of the old. In this sense, I agree tha the revealing is better than scrolling, because when scrolling, you don't immediately focus on the new stuff. Instead, the old and some of the new stuff is all a big blur until you stop scrolling. That breaks your concentration.<p>However, as someone pointed out, revealing is not good for ""scrolling back up"". That is an important point. Revealing is a different psychological phenomenon.<p>To summarize: revealing is not scrolling. Revealing is about using a novel method of showing new content, always de-emphasizing the old one (in Ben the Bodyguard, for instance, new things move but the old things stay still). Revealing is good for presenting information in a forward direction, and wears off with the novelty of the method. The web shouldn't all scroll this way.",1357925891

I think the idea is that we're so dependent on frameworks these days, there are massive pieces of our application that we have no clue how they work, and worse, we trust the framework authors implicitly. More and more we're seeing the downfalls of this. As Rails is essentially the best known and most deployed, hence the name.<p>Think about it: for most apps, probably 95% of your code is a framework that you didn't write. When this is criticized, the response is typically ""open source unicorns! speak no more!"" Moreover, there seems to be a different level of forgiveness just because it's open source. If ASP.NET WebForms had the same level of security holes in the past years as Rails ... just wow.<p>I love frameworks, and I think an average team would on the whole write less secure code than an open source framework would. If we want maximum transparency into our code, we'd go back to CGI written in C, but our productivity would tank, and looking back, the boom of recent years never would have happened.<p>However, we need a different attitude. Let's be honest: the arguments about open source are mostly a lie. Yeah, I went there. No, I'm not advocating closed source. Too many hang their hat on the ideals of open source. We're not talking ideals. We're talking rubber meets the road, cash leaves the bank reality. ""Anyone can view the source - many eyeballs makes it more secure."" The truth is, there aren't that many eyeballs. How many download, or (for the real technology ninjas) git clone, and trust what they're working with (whether app or framework) by a faith that rivals any religious organization?<p>As an industry, we need to read more code. We need to push back against the Barnes and Noble developer, the one who paid $29 for a book and now calls themselves a developer because they finished it front to back. Not everyone needs to be a senior engineer, but we have too many with that title after 3 years of building framework apps who couldn't code their way out of a CS101 class if they had Donald Knuth and Dennis Ritchie as their personal tutors.<p>This is pure supposition, but I think if at least 10% of those who used Rails read Rails, it'd be far more secure.",1357925638

The scroll metaphor is broken and the pagination metaphor is not fully implemented (you need an indicator of where you are, like pages in a real book). The percentage indicator doesn't cut it.<p>2. Control feels too fine. It's too easy to lose your place and mental effort needs to be devoted to properly placing the page divider. I would like to see a version that scrolls in discrete steps by line, perhaps with a little smoothing by way of animation. This would also give you a new feature: using the divider as a reading aid as people often do with rulers and real books.<p>Think of it this way: you have two controls, page turn and pixel-advance. What is a control with granularity somewhere between those interfaces that combines some of the advantages of both for navigating?<p>3. I'm not convinced by the divider. I think it either needs to communicate a visual metaphor, perhaps implying that the new page comes out on top of the current page using shadows, or just needs to be softer using blurring or fading the adjacent text out to white.

Those two demands for places to sleep, from tourists and residents, are at odds.

Photons with energies between 1.2 and 10 TeV arrived 4 minutes after those in a band between .25 and .6 TeV. The average delay was .030.012 seconds per GeV of energy of the photon. If the relation between the space velocity of a photon and its energy is linear, then this translates into the fractional difference in the speed of light being equal to minus the photon's energy divided by 21017 GeV. The researchers have suggested that the delay could be explained by the presence of quantum foam, the irregular structure of which might slow down photons by minuscule amounts only detectable at cosmic distances such as in the case of the blazar.

The corresponding public key is sent and stored in the offline transaction signing box. Whenever the user wants to initiate a withdrawal, the transaction signing box creates a random number that needs to the signed with the private key that corresponds to the public key it has on store.

Huge difference.<p>There is no plausible 'consumer protection' story for preventing licensed livery cab drivers from picking up curb hails, whether on the iphone or otherwise. The law is there to protect the incomes of people who buy cab licences.<p>There is no plausible 'consumer protection' story that would explain why building codes for permanent residence are not good enough for temporary residence as well. The law is there to protect hotel operators from vacation rental competition.<p>So let's not compare Bitcoin with Uber and Airbnb, because they are completely different animals.<p>Bank security regulations, OTOH, ARE designed to protect consumers, although I'd argue that they're mostly unnecessary in practice. Legitimate banks don't get hacked because there are billions of dollars at stake for the banking institution, and their business literally depends on their ability to secure payments. The incentives are there with or without bank regulations.<p>Bitcoin sites, on the other hand, regularly get hacked because they are fly-by-night operations written by idiots who are probably also trying to steal from you. It's the fake-money equivalent of using www.send-monie-through-me.co.in and then being surprised when you get ripped off.<p>Bottom line: there is nothing wrong with regulation designed to protect consumers from actual threats.

Although I agree that it is unlikely that it was their intent from the outset, there is a threshhold at which point someone has practically decided not to do something. Once they have procrastinated on doing something for X months and know that it is only #73 on their internal priority list, they have essentially decided not to do it. It could happen, but the odds are, what, maybe 10%? If you assume that a commitment to do something is giving a 100% guarantee and a commitment to not do something is a 0% guarantee, a 10% chance is, pragmatically, a ""no"".<p>Also, part of the implied deal was that you write the review promptly. From the original blog post where Schneier made the book offer:<p>> Liars and Outliers has been out since late February, and while it's selling great, I'd like it to sell better. So I have a special offer for my regular readers.<p>I don't think he was hoping they would send in their reviews a year or two later. Those who do would have a hard time arguing that they met the spirit of the deal.<p>The initial blog post was almost exactly 5 months ago and the offer was closed in two days, which means that a lot of readers probably got their books at least 4 months ago. (In my experience he does ship promptly, as I have gotten a book from him before.) If he was hoping that they would write their review in a reasonable amount of time, say 8 months, and only 9% wrote a review in the first half, I highly, highly doubt that even 41% will write a review in the second half. And the majority of those who will not probably subconsciously know it by now.<p><i></i>Edit: To be specific, I don't think he expected 90% turnout by this date, he's just disappointed that the turnout is so low by now. It's not even 1 in 10. 4 months is a decent amount of time to review a book you agreed to review.",1357923802

Robinson made an important contribution, but his work is like the assembly language of logic. Modern papers are much higher level. Kowalski's book is 1979, so its like C.

But you DO have to write them your self. Thats just how open source works. Open source isn't about getting free stuff. People had to write those tools, and they did, because they cared. Lisp isn't so great because McCarty made it great, it's great because for <i>50 years</i> people worked fucking hard to make it great. Standardizing common lisp took 10 years and a shit ton of money. Every library took months or years out of someones life. You get all that for FREE. If you really care about lisp, you will actually work to make it better. You will be one of those who spend their time and money on it.<p>Being one of the countless people complaining on forums impresses no one, only makes your ego feel better, doesn't actually help at all. In fact, it's hurtful to lisp, because curious people might read your comments and conclude that lisp isn't worth it for them, and for some of them, it might be, it certainly was for me. So that is why I'm angry. I'm actually trying to help you and lisp, not trying to insult people. If you care about lisp, you'll make it better, if you don't, just do something else, and be happy with it, if lisp can't make you happy.

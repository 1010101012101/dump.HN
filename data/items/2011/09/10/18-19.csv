I think the fix would be mostly a matter of coming up with terminology that doesn't fall flat on its ass, but still remains accessible, because, on the other hand, speaking of amplitude distributions would kind of alienate a lot of people.<p>Anyway, much more importantly - it's a clever little engineering trick to entangle the two photons. However, and I will say I have not researched the topic of quantum computing - doesn't operating them require interference between the different branches of the system at some point to get meaningful results? If so, you would need to get two or more branches to end up in exactly the same state, and nothing in the article mentions that the cesium atoms that have been altered will reset without outside influence.<p>Anyway, I put the conditional probability that I know everything about the system or quantum mechanics awfully close to 0, so it's more of a curiosity (how would you make it work?) instead of a genuine concern.",1315680389

I live less than five hours from Austin, travel there for business occasionally and rarely get calls from companies in Austin interested in hiring me or if I know anyone they should hire.<p>On the flip side, I am rarely in the valley (a few times a year at best) and I get calls or emails almost weekly asking either if I am interested in a job or if I might know someone who is, most of these even offering sign on bonuses and bounties for hires.<p>Yet the CEO's of companies in Austin are trotting out to the valley to find the talent while everyday good programmers from surrounding states go to the valley because they don't see Austin as a viable alternative.<p>They have a top tier engineering program only hours away (Rice) which has basically become a funnel for Microsoft and Amazon in Seattle yet they want to focus their attention on the valley.<p>Go to schools like Georgia Tech, Rice, Carnegie Mellon, Illinois, UT. Alot of those kids are coming from the south or the midwest and they end up in the valley because they think that is the only place they can make it.<p>At the end of the day this really comes down to marketing, and when you spend your money marketing to developers that have already been sold on another city often you are too late, but if you hit them earlier like the valley has gotten so good at doing they are MUCH more likely to see Austin as a viable solution",1315679927

I moved to Austin from New York City by way of Portland, Oregon so believe me, when I say that there is no way I would live in TEXAS; Austin is anything but that.<p>Also, other reasons Austin may be attractive to potential candidates:<p>1.)  No state income tax.  This is huge.  If you make $140k a year in SF, you take home significantly less than you do in Texas.  Also, there is no ""city tax"" like SF has.<p>2.)  Cost of living is HALF, that's right, HALF of SF.  Beautiful homes or urban condos are available and priced well below what you would spend buying OR renting in SF.<p>1 + 2 = lots of $$ in your pocket.<p>Not to mention the fact that Austin is arguably the hippest city in the country from a growth perspective.  With events like ACL and SXSW (plus the thousands of live music shows throughout the rest of the year), the creative arts scene is flourishing.<p>Finally, the weather.

On the other hand, I have played other MMOs, online FPSes, and so forth that have in-game stores.<p>Come to think of it, the only correlation I can think of is that web applications are more prolific for online sales than desktop apps, which typically relied on a model of ""buy me, install me, and you own me<i>"".  My experience in the gaming world suggests that people are happy to pay for things within the desktop game interfaces, too.  I have also read that iPhone apps with in-app sales (particularly for free apps) are greater than the initial app sales, and it is obvious that users have no problems making payments for things through their phone apps.<p>I assumed that ""web app"" refers to things that must be run through a web browser, as opposed to ""app that can connect to the Internet"", which will cover recurring subscriptions like Norton's latest virus updates and so forth.<p></i> ""if you follow my TOS""",1315678499

You could have taken 1, 2, ..., n or indeed any set of n integers with distinct residue classes modulo n as the representatives, but the standard choice in mathematics is 0, 1, ..., n-1 for consistency with the division theorem.<p>It is often very inconvenient when mathematicians number from 1 instead of 0. A classic example is with Fourier matrices. Let w be a primitive nth root of unity. Then numbering as computer scientists, starting with 0, the formula is F(i,j) = w^(i j). But using the mathematician's convention, it is F(i,j) = w^((i-1)(j-1)). The same issue exists with all Vandermonde matrices.",1315678247

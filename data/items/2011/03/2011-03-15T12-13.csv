No Israeli VC raised money in 2010.  Of course, both angels and VC's will talk to you about your idea, but when push comes to shove, there is no investment money available.<p>On the other hand, Ycombinator, techstars and others in the US are creating 20-60 companies each year, raising between $0.5M and $1.5M per company.  So what gives?<p>My theory is that the relatively recent wealth generation from google, twitter, facebook, ebay, etc. are all located in the US and that it is these young newly-millionaire engineers who are driving Internet investments.

I think the opposite is quite clear - the main components survived the earthquake just fine.<p>The problem right now is the lack of power. The pumps are run on electric power, and as soon as the earthquake came the power plant itself shut down. So now you need external power to run the pumps. The power infrastructure failed and no other power plants could power these pumps. So they switched to backup generators, which were then wiped out by a tsunami. Then they switched to batteries (which worked fine, until they ran out). Then they brought in backup generators, which failed. Now we're onto pumping seawater in.<p>If sea wall had been 50' high instead of 30' high (estimates), the generators would have survived and we wouldn't be hearing about this. If the batteries were more than 8 hours we probably wouldn't be hearing about this. If the external generators worked, we wouldn't be hearing about this. Those are the only mistakes.<p>Compare that to Gen 4 reactors being designed today - no pumps required to circulate fluid.

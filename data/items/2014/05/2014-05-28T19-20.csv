7812365,comment,7811275,7811275,1,0,lgeek,,,"I&#x27;ve been hacking Rockchip RK3188-based devices for a few months now. What caught my attention are the low cost Android PC-on-a-stick and tablets using this SoC. We&#x27;re talking about $50-ish delivered for a PC-on-a-stick with 2GB of RAM, HDMI output and a WiFi+Bluetooth adapter and $150-$200 for a decently built tablet with similar specs, some even having high-DPI screens.<p>Radxa Rock (the article keeps talking about &#x27;the Radxa&#x27; when that&#x27;s the name of the company selling Radxa Rock, by the way) is similar to the various PC-on-a-stick, but in a development board form factor and with more I/Os and GPIO exposed.<p>Rockchip only provides support for Android and more recently Chrome OS, with GNU/Linux support being mostly community developed. The good news is that most hardware is working on GNU/Linux, with the exception of the video decoder and encoder (which is typical for most SoCs)and the NAND driver is closed source because it includes the flash translation layer which is treated as a trade secret by flash vendors. The bad news is that the kernel code developed by Rockchip is a bit crap and the community forks are quite fragmented because there&#x27;s no central place to centralize various patches. Even so, it&#x27;s generally straightforward to add support for a new board. We have a wiki[0] and an IRC channel - #linux-rockchip on Freenode if you&#x27;re interested. The Radxa guys maintain their own fork so at least for their platform it&#x27;s clear what to use.<p>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good choice for running Android or for hacking or for doing processing tasks (things like a building packages, running a low power webserver, continuous integration, etc) on GNU/Linux.<p>Some people in this thread ask/complain about platform-specific GNU/Linux distributions. There&#x27;s Picuntu[1], but my view is that platform-specific distros are completely unnecessary and even a bit silly. On x86 you don&#x27;t run Thinkpad-Ubuntu, you just run the generic Ubuntu. This is no different for ARM computers, you can use any generic distribution with a ARM port, with a kernel image compiled for your hardware and maybe one or two other drivers which need to be set up in userspace.<p>Compared to RPi, RK3188 (and other similar SoC) devices have a massive advantage since it&#x27;s ARMv7 while RPi is ARMv6 which most distros don&#x27;t support anymore. The difference in CPU performance compared to Raspberry can&#x27;t be understated, it has 4 cores which are maybe 2 to 4 times faster for most workloads, about three times the memory bandwidth, four times the RAM, etc.<p>[0] <a href=""http://linux-rockchip.info/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://linux-rockchip.info/</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://home.g8.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://home.g8.net/</a>",1401306231

Either you are buying from the wrong vendor, or you have some wonky ideas of how many load balancers you need per data center, or are not using them correctly. ( hint: check a10 networks and Zeus)<p>The reality is, that if your problem is only L3, then arguably this can be solved many ways. For example, networks have been doing 10s of gigabits of L3 load balancing using DSR for ages. Dynamic route propagation doesn’t have a hold on this ( albeit it’s more “elegant” ).<p>But most people do more than L3, and really do L4-L7 load balancing, and most modern “application load balancing” platforms are really software packages bundled up in a nice little appliance. This is where packages like varnish with its vcl/vmod’s  and caching,  Aflex ( from a10 networks ) and Traffic Sscript from Zeus , amongst others, come in.  Shuffling bits is the easy part! Understanding the request, and making decisions on that is the harder part.<p>If you split the problem, and are using varnish or nginx as your application load balancer, you can’t claim you’ve gotten rid of them, you were either not buying the right initial platform, or using it correctly. When you put a “stop buying load balancers”… you must first define what you mean by “load balancer” ;)<p>For the record, I&#x27;ve used both commercial load balancing platforms as well as contributed patches and used OSS load balancing platforms..",1401306181

7812151,comment,7811452,7811902,10,0,cwyers,,,"So, lemme ask you a question. When you see a statement that something is true MOST of the time, what exactly possesses you to think that citing ONE EXAMPLE is a rebuttal?<p>And again, books are absolutely not commodities. Nobody is saying there&#x27;s no difference between the preference for Harry Potter versus Percy Jackson or what have you. But Percy Jackson is certainly a close substitute for Harry Potter, so if the price difference between them is great enough, some readers will choose to read Percy Jackson instead of Harry Potter, and the number of readers for which this is true grows as the price difference does. This is also true if the supply of Harry Potter books is restricted. (This is the principle that makes small airport bookstores work, incidentally -- given the constrained supply of books available for purchase, airport book stores stock the most popular titles they can and figure that people will substitute their most preferred book that&#x27;s available for the book they would purchase if the store carried a larger selection. And often enough, they do.)<p>And this is true for most goods. Android phones and iPhones are close substitutes for each other -- if you want one, that&#x27;s the one you want, but if the price difference gets high enough, you&#x27;ll go to the close substitute, and people vary in their level of price sensitivity. If the price of corn tortillas gets high enough, you&#x27;ll start eating flour tortillas. And so on and so forth. This is pretty basic economics here.",1401304013

The new sensors use less current, so they don&#x27;t get that hot during a long (live view, movie mode) exposure.<p>The DSLRs still have a few advantages over low-end mirrorless cameras: faster reaction time, faster focusing time (usually because they use phase-detection and not contrast-detection focus sensors), better ergonomics.

But, the problem is that the majority of people are simply too afraid to learn new things, too worried that they might find out that they were wrong about something, or that their parents were wrong about something. And then you have kids coming to college who think that simply because they spent the money they should be handed a degree and a job. So, what I&#x27;m saying, is that there are a great many people, and unfortunately a lot of them are policy makers, who have unrealistic demands of public education.

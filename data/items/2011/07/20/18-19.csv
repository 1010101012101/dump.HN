2786957,comment,2785195,2785195,4,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I've been working very hard to make Java use less memory using techniques like these and others more. The problem is, if you really want to specify exactly how non-trivial structured objects are packed into memory, you end up writing your own garbage collector and memory allocator, which is a rather large project all by itself. Also, I have found that cutting down on memory usage like that hurts performance a lot.<p>At the end of the day, going down that road makes you less productive than working in C++ and the result will still be subpar compared to a C or C++ solution. So I'm back with C++ right now even though I'm painfully aware of its weaknesses.",1311188329

Out in that area (the pacific northwest), physical activity is a huge deal -- hiking, skiing, and snowboarding especially. On every team I was on, the vast majority of the people were in stunningly good shape. Even the 35+, multiple-kids crowd.<p>I still remember one time that I almost killed an interview candidate by mistake. Ran down to pick him up in the lobby, and then started talking to him on the way up to our offices... realizing at the second of five floors that we needed to move this discussion to the elevator before he had a heart attack. We used the elevators so rarely that it hadn't even occurred to me!<p>Of course, there were strange things about it. Many people got season-long Mt.

Fully functional MVP with paying/profit-inducing users<p>2. Partial MVP with paying/profit-inducing users<p>3. Full or partial MVP with real users<p>4. Full or partial MVP with beta users<p>5. Full or partial MVP (the real product) with no users<p>6. Interactive prototype<p>7. Wireframes and mockups<p>8. Powerpoint slides<p>The closer you can get to the top of the list, in general the more motivated an investor will be. Of course, this is real life and you can't just jump to position 1 or 2. For this reason, if you are only at a position 6 to 8, it is often better to focus on pitching technical cofounders first, getting to at least position 5 or higher, and then pitching investors.",1311188228

Personally I hate these legal agreements, I find I can always read it with a different hat on and see it in a different light, perhaps that's the point.<p>What is clear however, is that web services and startups clearly need a set of T&C's we can use without fear of alienating our customers, but that also protect us legally from future prosection.<p>Recently I launched my project CircuitBee (http://www.circuitbee.com) which lets you embed electronic schematics like you would a video with YouTube. I've been working on it part time for over 18 months now and finally we got it released. We slapped the Wordpress CC licensed terms and conditions on it and sent it out the door.<p>We posted about it on the AdaFruit forums today (http://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=22089), and our first bit of useful feedback has been about the T&C's. It appears we didn't read them closely enough and included a section that covers the licenses the owner of the content grants us to modify, and redistribute the content for the web service. In short, we fell foul of the same legalese that cause DropBox such backlash recently.<p>Now DropBox recently posted a modification to their terms making it clearer that they want no part in the ownership of the content. I'd like to do something similar for CircuitBee, but of course legal documents are copyrighted just like any other so I can't wholesale copy the DropBox terms. Leading me to this post.<p>Does anyone know of any good, legal, and above all readable and acceptable set of terms and conditions that are available under a Creative Commons license or something similar?<p>If not, perhaps there's a lawyer in the room that might like to start drafting some?",1311188049

Those ""team building"" activities have a very artificial feeling to them and while many management people gladly will jump on any currently popular management bandwagon, I think most participants just think it's ridiculous, even through no-one will say it out loud. The actual team building happens when people do their real work together and there are sensible ways to encourage this, there was recently this post roughly about how Pixar or Apple offices are arranged in a way that you have to go across the whole office to grab a tea, so that people run into each other many times a day and have a chance to discuss stuff.",1311187937

Recently, a physician friend of mine hit me with an idea for a novel type of medical imaging device and it's interesting enough that I'd like to help him get it built.<p>Broadly, we believe the device would be made from relatively commodity imaging infra (such as found in cheap USB microscopes like this one - http://www.amazon.com/Veho-Deluxe-USB-Powered-Microscope/dp/B0025U0L8Y ) combined with specific lenses and illumination fabricated for this particular usecase.<p>The hardware part of this problem doesn't feel very difficult but I'm basically starting from square one so I could be 110% wrong.  There is some software image processing required as well but I'm in a much better position to tackle that part of the problem.<p>Any ideas / guesstimates for what HW prototyping something like this might cost?

Most of these, at least the ones that I've been to, only teach how to raise significant sums of money from VC's a la the 1990's dot com boom and are taught by washed up VC's themselves. In other words, most of these things are worthless.<p>Which is why I ask: what do you wish you knew early on that would've saved headaches? So far, our list includes: choosing cofounders, rapid prototyping, ""hustling"" (talking to customers immediately, and selling your product quickly to get cash in the door), and Delaware incorporation.

2786926,comment,2785160,2786563,4,0,Produce,,,"I agree with your point about bureaucracy being necessary when using a hierarchical model for society. This has a basis in our neurochemistry, in particular, Dunbar's number which puts a limit on how many individuals we consider to be people, where everyone else we know are lumped into 'the others' category. The majority of us treat 'the others' considerably worse than our friends, where we are more likely to lie, cheat and steal from them. Bureaucracy is necessary when such large organizations exist since it patches the bug. Unfortunately, as we can see from the results, it's a low quality patch which addresses the effects and not the causes.<p>An obvious solution is to go around the mountain. If such large monolithic structures come with such a burden then why not decentralize and cut them down to a reasonable size that our hardware can better handle? This is, ofcourse, also a patch, which, personally, I think would address the effects more efficiently. To address the root causes, we would either need to modify our neurochemistry or DNA or provide education so that individuals can overcome Dunbar's number.",1311187788

When you open it (in Snow Leopard), it opens the last opened project.<p>Logic is a pretty complex application, and there are a lot of different synths and filters. The synths take a lot of memory, since they have a large number (presumably) lossless audio samples in them (think every key on a piano, times X for X number of different strike velocities).<p>Therefore, Logic only loads the synths that are needed for files that you have open. It actually recommends with an alert box that you close your current file before opening another one.<p>When you open a file, it loads all of the synths for that file - this can take a long time.<p>The result is, when you open Logic, if the last file that you had opened isn't the one you want to work on now, you have to wait for that file to load, then close it, then open the file you actually want and wait for that one to load.<p>This probably won't be a problem for Adobe users, because Adobe is really bad at making native-feeling Mac OS software, so this probably won't be supported. But for Apple's document-based media applications (Final Cut and Logic, Aperture is different because of its nature), this is a bigger issue (Final Cut has some... bigger issues right now though).<p>The other issue is the privacy one. I used graphic designers working for competing clients as an example, but really, it could apply to anyone that values their privacy. Personally, I <i>like</i> my browser being a blank slate each time I start it back up.<p>A final issue that I can think of is with applications that tend to be opened by files (the user clicks on a file in Finder, not on the application). QuickTime and Preview are good examples. If I open a picture in Preview by double clicking it in Finder, typically I don't also want to see the last picture I viewed as well.

Still, the shift from ""you might be interested in these shoes based on your search history"" to ""you might be interested in not having a computer infected with malware"" seems pretty significant and bold to me.  I really admire their vision and execution, but it still frightens me when I consider how much access I give Google to a large portion of my personal and professional life.<p>When Google becomes self-aware on August 29, 1997, I am really going to be screwed.",1311184915

The plane looked and felt like it was right next to us, like .. hundreds of yards apart. Cross-country planes do this all the time, so far as I can gather.<p>[edit: fixed typo, added ending to sentence]",1311184900

There's a difference between writing a 30-page business plan (useless) and having a solid plan of how to build the company. Especially for angels, having a huge business plan will not help.<p><i>If you need more [than $1MM in capital], you need to focus on venture capital territory.</i><p>This used to be true. But today, with the emergence of the abundance of angels, super-angels, and AngelList, this is no longer true. This is one of many big disruptions in venture capital financing over the past few years.<p><i>Your fifth-year revenue projections better be between $20M-$100M.</i><p>The best angels I know don't care about fifth-year revenue projections. It's hard enough to estimate what the company will be like in 6 months. A fifth-year estimate is useless. Only when you start to raise Series A financing from an institutional investor do these figures start to matter.<p><i>Rules of thumb include an opportunity projection that exceeds a billion dollars</i><p>Again, for angel investors, it's a completely different situation. For institutional firms, they want to own 30-40% of your company, and want you to aim for the fences in order to get the necessary returns. For angel investors, a $20mm exit is a nice return. It's still acceptable to raise an angel round and get an early exit.<p><i>Certain business sectors have historical high failure rates and are routinely avoided by investors...food service...gaming...</i><p>There's some truth to this, but we're seeing a lot of innovation (and funding) in companies that experiment in these areas. Look at ZeroCater and Gooble for food innovation, and the entire social gaming industry.",1311184895

I just completed my first xcode 4 based project last night, and the instructions on Apple's site (for binary signing, and the like) have yet to be updated for xcode 4 - since the process is already complicated enough, had I not done it before with xcode 3 I would have been completely out to lunch.<p>With that said, if you're comfortable with xcode 3, you shouldn't have a problem switching to xcode 4.",1311184857

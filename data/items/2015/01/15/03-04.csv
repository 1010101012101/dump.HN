8890815,comment,8889904,8890708,0,0,gamblor956,,,"You&#x27;re being downvoted because you&#x27;re misunderstanding what &quot;free climbing&quot; means. It is a technical climbing term meaning that the weight of the climber is supported by the climber himself at all times during ascent; safety gear such as ropes are used only to protect against falls.  &quot;Solo free climbing&quot; (or &quot;free solo climbing&quot;) is climbing without any gear, including safety gear.  It is basically suicide on a climb above 25 feet in height.<p>This climb is historic because it is the first time any person (let alone two) has managed to climb the entire height via free climbing methods, that is, without using ropes to bear some/all of their weight during the ascent.<p>Eventually, someone will try to free climb El Capitan similar to the manner you described: pitch by pitch, without returning to a base camp, resting along the way.  However, such a climb is a long ways off; it took nearly a decade to plan this climb.  Planning a climb with shifting camps will likely take another several years just to plot out plausible routes and resting points.",1421294312

One is that higher teacher\n    salaries dominate small class size as a factor in\n    high PISA scores. This is a reassuring finding\n    because it suggests that secondary school education\n    can be improved at no net increase in cost, since\n    higher teacher salaries are offset by larger\n    classes—if class size is raised in proportion to\n    increases in teacher salaries, there is no net\n    increase in the school’s cost, and there should\n    actually be a reduction in cost in the long term\n    because a reduction in the number of classrooms\n    reduces the size and therefore cost of a school even\n    if each classroom is larger\n</code></pre>\nThat seems to indicate that paying teachers more does help.",1421293861

When Backprop was invented back in the 80s, you couldn&#x27;t train networks with more than a couple of 1000 nodes tops. Today, with GPUs, you can train networks with billions of parameters.<p>2. More data is available. Back in those days, you had a few dozens (maybe a few 100s) of examples in your training set. Today, people play with sets larges than 1TB.<p>3. Dramatic successes. For a while, the ImageNet competition was seeing slow and stead progress. Then DL comes along, and there&#x27;s a 20% jump in performance (I&#x27;m too lazy to look up the exact numbers...). If you&#x27;ve ever competed in such competitions, progress is painfully slow (see, for example, the Netflix competition). So a jump of that magnitude in performance in 1 step is mind-blowing. On top of that, every year since then, the performance has increased significantly.<p>These are just 3 that come to mind.",1421293801

I couldn&#x27;t afford to go to uni because my parents made just enough so that I couldn&#x27;t get any aid. They also didn&#x27;t have money to spare and were smart enough not to cosign loans for me to go to a university. Who can blame them? Its crazy to spend 10s of thousands of dollars to take intro classes that are basically just substitutes for how terrible our k-12 system is. My parents did encourage me to go to college though, so I went to one nearby right after highschool.<p>I would like to point out that even though its cheap, if you aren&#x27;t in district its quite a bit more expensive. I think it ended up being around $100 a credit hour where I went since I wasn&#x27;t in district. I know that is peanuts compared to universities, but if you have to pay out of packet, it adds up really quick, especially with books etc.<p>I was lucky that my parents let me use their car and live at home for free. Because of this, I could pay for the classes outright by working 30 or so hours a week at minimum wage. Its really depressing to work for months and all summer, saving virtually all of the money you make, and then blow at the start of each semester.<p>Ultimately this worked out well for me though, because by getting high grades and most of an associates degree, I was able to get significant transfer scholarships and not have to take a bunch of pointless intro classes. I&#x27;m not saying that all liberal arts classes are pointless, but some of them are, and it feels like hell to have to pay for those classes out of pocket, especially when you make minimum wage (which was $7.40 at the time). I would rather just read a book on a subject than take a class in something that I only have passing interest in.<p>I still have some debt from university due to double majoring and adding another year (which is when my scholarships ran out), but I still got out with < 15k in debt. And hey, that&#x27;s peanuts when you get a software engineering job right out of school. I would have had so much more debt if I didn&#x27;t go to CC first.<p>I will say that I meant quite a few people abusing the Pell grants though. People who lived at home for free and had no ambition would get Pell grants which covered their classes and gave them an overage for living expenses. They would just take the easiest classes and pocket the overage check. It was like a job for them. So I&#x27;m sure there will be people trying to do the same here, and there will be sleazy schools trying to get a chunk of the money too, but those are just problems that need to be solved.",1421293188

Dalio is no small force [1], but his thoughts and models are, in some sense, just &quot;another&quot; model to add to the mix.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.economist.com/node/21549968"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/node/21549968</a><p>Here, my point is not to support or detract from Dalio&#x27;s model. My point is simply that many people (and many journalists) don&#x27;t seem to get what models are, at their core. They are tools.<p>Yes, sometimes traditional economic models get &quot;too much&quot; credit and mindshare. I like seeing alternative models. After taking a look at Dalio&#x27;s snappy presentation, connecting <i>almost</i> everything with a nice explanation, I really miss an academic presentation, with equations. (I&#x27;m not saying Dalio doesn&#x27;t have them -- Bridgewater Associates certainly does.)<p>Both in the case of this presentation and in many mainstream accounts, the language commonly used in economic models sometimes lulls readers/listeners/viewers into conflating the model with reality. Don&#x27;t let it. The world is complicated. If you want to force a complicated world into a simple model, you can, with varying results.<p>Here is my central point. Everyone, including all flavors of economists and Dalio himself, are peddling models. Don&#x27;t let their claims of being &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;mechanical&quot; distract you. (Some people claim the opposite, e.g. &quot;my complex model is the most realistic&quot;.) People will accentuate any aspect of their model. Like any good salesperson or marketer, they will find the words that engender trust.<p>(In modeling-speak, modelers often seek to build models that their audience will find intuitive. Models that are too non-intuitive, in their assumptions at least, sometimes get quickly discarded. Models with intuitive low-level behavior and non-intuitive higher-level behavior often garner a lot of attention, because they are deemed to be believable but surprising.)<p>What makes a good model? That&#x27;s a long conversation. For now, I&#x27;ll just say this: use some model(s) that are useful for your situation. It is obvious, but you&#x27;d be amazed how few people take this advice to heart. Perhaps they want the &quot;best&quot; model, which is akin to asking for the &quot;best&quot; car. In practice, many people go with the most familiar model, though many don&#x27;t like to admit it.<p>I&#x27;m not saying models are bad. I am saying two main things:<p>1. If you are using numbers (even rough ones) and seriously think that you aren&#x27;t using a model, you are fooling yourself. I&#x27;ll give three examples where people pretend that they aren&#x27;t using a model:<p>1A. If you are shooting from the hip, then you are using an unspecified, perhaps instinctual, probably non-repeatable, model.<p>1B. If you are &quot;just doing the numbers&quot; then your choice of what numbers to include <i>is</i> your model.<p>1C. If you are doing &quot;theory-free&quot; data mining, then you are still relying on some technique(s) to surface certain patterns. Ok, so you might not be using a specified model (such as linear regression with particular variables), but how did you select your variables? If you are using a SVM, what kernel are you using? If you are using a NN, how many layers and what configuration? These are still assumptions. Your choice of technique (and preference for bias vs. variance) will shape what patterns you find.<p>2. Relying on too few models is foolish.",1421291958

As far as I&#x27;m aware, the scientific community is pretty convinced that the adult brain has a large degree of neuroplasticity [1] and can retain a significant amount as we age [2]. It&#x27;s also been shown what we refer to as &quot;fluid intelligence&quot; can actually be trained and optimized for [3]. I would argue that until real, systemic cognitive decline begins occurring (let&#x27;s say ~65), any differences in an individual&#x27;s ability to learn new things and retain facts based on age can probably be more strongly attributed to their internal biases from their pre-acquired knowledge than an inability to learn.<p>Maybe in some part I&#x27;m arguing semantics (&quot;either way, what appears to be a decline still occurs&quot;), but to say that cognitive decline happens sooner when related to aptitude for maths as opposed to aptitude for biology is a little silly without a citation. Would love to read these articles if you have resources.<p>It&#x27;s probably a mistake to write off an older adult&#x27;s ability to learn. I would lean to heavily favour Elon&#x27;s anecdote [4], &quot;I do kinda feel like my head is full! My context switching penalty is high and my process isolation is not what it used to be. Frankly, though, I think most people can learn a lot more than they think they can. They sell themselves short without trying.&quot; --- more knowledge means you have the ability to be more discerning which can be more computationally expensive (and take longer), but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily offset ability to learn.

There have been similar controversies all over the world, another notable example being on Cerro Torre in Patagonia.<p>Unless a climbing area is a designated &quot;sport climbing area&quot;, bolts are generally not placed unless there is no other way to protect a stretch of climbing.  Climbers try to place devices that don&#x27;t damage the rock (nuts, cams, tricams, hexes, etc.) first, but sometimes none of those devices will work as they all rely on jamming against something, and blank faces do not have the cracks and holes into which jamming gear can be inserted.

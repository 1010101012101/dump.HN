I'm guessing it's been written for java/symbian/iphone/blackberry? Also a good idea to write the phones tested on.<p>Not every phone has bluetooth and can run third-party apps, especially if you bought a cheap non-branded phone.  Also, not every would know it's necessary for a device like this.<p>Even better, why not allow us to download the app now?",1259150125

They seem (to me) to be common issues, and he mostly has the right idea. Rather than pick it apart point-by-point, could you pick  just <i>one</i> point he's wrong on?<p>When a person makes disparaging generalizations, it sounds like they have prejudged the work, without reading it (why waste time reading it - they <i>know</i> it's bad). Maybe you're right, but it's hard to tell if you give only judgment and no evidence. Therefore I ask ""can you elaborate please?"" :-)<p>BTW: I followed your suggestion, and found this excellent comment of yours about pitching to VCs (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=866299"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=866299</a>), and I agree a lot of time and effort went into it. So I stand corrected on that issue, and my apologies for suggesting otherwise! :-) (though I'm sure much more blood sweat and tears went into the getting of your experience than in the writing - maybe that's true for the blogger too?)<p>aside: it's weird - I upvoted, but your comment is still at 1 point... I've seen this happen before when I upvote a reply to me. It may be a bug, perhaps related to downvotes being disabled on replies to one's own comments.<p>PS: this exchange made me think about my own mistakes. They are very specific to my area, and then to be against the received wisdom (e.g. Alan Kay above). But it's not immediately clear to me what my mistakes have been, and what I've learned... it seems like it would be a useful exercise to consider this.",1259149522

960971,comment,960945,960945,0,0,jacquesm,,,"There are a number of valid reasons for this, and a number of not-so-valid ones:<p>The valid reasons mostly center on the fact that 'mining history' at some point comes to a halt, there are only so many relevant subjects from the past that warrant inclusion.<p>At some point it gets harder to find stuff that you can include on pages about historical events, objects and people.<p>This will lead to a reduction of work and like any company that would work on a job that has 'an end' (the documentation of history would be that job) that when the job is done the people end up without work.<p>The other reasons are less nice and do not stem from accomplishment but from the power that a relatively small group of experienced users wields.<p>Wikipedia is full of politics and infighting. The atmosphere, especially for new people joining up is full of venom. New editors have their content (their work!) deleted, often without cause, get bombarded with messages with lots of wikipedia specific jargon and feel in general seriously intimidated.<p>Of course this nicely serves the purpose of those that have hijacked wikipedia from being a public project to one that they use as their personal fiefdom.<p>There are 'factions' amongst the editors that seem to be aware of this problem and there are those that seem to be it's main creators. I hope that in the long run the first group will get the upper hand but judging by the various wars on 'talk' pages it might be that it is the former group that is now giving up and leaving.<p>I predict that wikipedia will sooner or later be 'forked' by a group of the former, with stricter guidelines in place for moderators and that the 'old' wikipedia will be abandoned to the inmates that want to run the asylum.",1259148970

960951,comment,960163,960847,0,0,forensic,,,"Claudio Stampi tested all the various forms of reducing sleep and found polyphasic - the uberman style - to be the best out of them all.<p>At the same time, he found that polyphasic sleep results in poorer performance compared to normal sleepers. And this was considered non-noteworthy, since obviously 2 hours of sleep is worse than 8. You can find his articles on Google Scholar.<p>Steve Pavlina is the only person I know of who has claimed to be polyphasic for an extended period of time and claimed that there is no performance decrease. Unfortunately, Steve refused to do any scientific testing and relied entirely on his own subjective judgment. He gave it up after 6 months anyway, but still maintains it is effective.<p>Steve's Pavlina's experience however exactly fits in with the best scientific understanding of sleep (which Wozniak perfectly elucidates). Steve Pavlina was never able to maintain the schedule without an alarm clock, which indicates that his body did not adapt and was not co-operating or behaving in a ""natural"" way.<p>The theory that Steve was only getting REM is shot down by his own journals which indicate that he was getting both Delta and REM. My own experience with polyphasic also indicates that while the proportion of REM may increase, you still get delta sleep. I was fully (and rigidly) polyphasic for some weeks but never stopped having delta sleep. I also consistently showed decreased performance that could only be overcome by surges of adrenaline and autonomic excitation in general - which is easily caused when a loud alarm clock wakes you up when your body desperately desires sleep. You are tricking your body into a state of permanent fight or flight.<p>Anyway the studies were done in the 80s that directly measured performance. But in the modern day extensive studies have been done on sleep and everything we know about sleep now shoots down all the theorizing that the polyphasics use to justify their crazy. The idea that delta wave sleep is useless has been utterly rejected because it has been shown that delta wave sleep contributes to long-term memory encoding. If you cut down on delta wave, you cut down on long-term memory. If you cut down on sleep in general, you cut down on cognitive abilities in general.<p>This trade off may be worth it for some people, but they should be aware that it is a trade off. Magical thinking like that displayed by Steve Pavlina does not magically make you immune from the negative side effects of sleep deprivation. You get over the drowsiness with sheer strength of will and adrenaline, but the fogginess doesn't go away. (Steve considered the fogginess to be a benefit. But remember this is a guy who believes ghosts tell him how to win at blackjack.)",1259146982

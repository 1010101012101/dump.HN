110609,comment,110465,110465,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"I think some portion of ""genius"" is the ability to recognize and run with ideas, some of which come from others.  Geniuses not only need to actually have an idea, they need the freedom to pursue it and get recognized.<p>Getting settled in to a family need not diminish the capacity for ideas, but following the established social conventions of ordinary people will reduce the chances to pursue them.  Settling down may also make geniuses less social and as a result they may not pick up as many new ideas from others and they will limit their chances to be recognized.",1202349521

If it is the latter then you can be expect confusion, even among techies.<p>You can describe your idea enthusiastically and people won't understand. You can sketch you idea on paper and people won't understand. You can make a mock screenshot and people won't understand. You can do a proof-of-concept implementation and people won't understand. So, you'll just have to code your app in full.<p>You're done when people only comment negatively about your graphic design. This is especially true if they've got less experience or aptitude in usability and graphic design.",1202348730

It is hard to take those companies that do that seriously.<p>Tell me, what does a code ninja do?  Write fast and crappy code, and disapear, so some other poor soul have to maintain it?  
Crash the whole server with two lines of recurisve calls?  Check-in code so stealthy that Subversion doesn't even detect it?<p>Ps. I noticed the ""code ninja"" trend, with the raise of Ruby on Rail.  It is everytime I have seen, it has been a posting for either Ruby, or Php job.",1202347697

110581,story,,,1,0,lanej0,"Keeping track of progress",,"I've been thinking lately about working on large projects and how to keep track of where things are at. Even if you're working on a project by yourself, I find that it's hard, over time, to know the state of each file - whether you've started it, you need to add stuff, if it still needs tweaking, or if it's done.<p>Here's an example: I've been working a bit on a web app in my spare time. I've got some of the basic back end processing stuff done. Certain pages haven't even been implemented yet. Certain pages are pretty much done.  Some need UI love.<p>Coming back to development after taking a bit of a break from it to pay the bills, I can't tell what's what unless I spend some time digging around in it.<p>I'm playing with the idea of using OS X's labels to accomplish some sort of a visual tracking of things, but it doesn't lend itself well to being able to keep notes, thoughts and to-dos about each page.<p>What do other people do? How do you scale this to multi-user? Version control (I use SVN) is okay, but again, difficult to get a quick view of what's what (maybe I need some kind of visual version control).",1202346413

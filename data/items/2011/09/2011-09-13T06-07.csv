2990287,comment,2989298,2989936,3,0,SwellJoe,,,"The weave bits, and Pyrex bits, found in this article are actually snippets of C/C++ written inline in the Python code (or very simplified Python), and able to access variables and such defined in the Python earlier (with caveats and when used with care), and later Python code is able to use the resulting compiled functions.<p>So, it's high level Python code, except when you need to write low level, super fast code.<p>The reality of making a very high level language compile down to high performance C/C++ is a much harder problem than ""compiling"" CoffeeScript to JavaScript. Both are quite high level, and CoffeeScript is merely very concise syntactic sugar for a number of common patterns in JavaScript, and maybe a few higher level constructs tacked on for good measure. But, JavaScript is effectively Scheme with C-like syntax; it was designed to be built up in this way, just like Lisp and Scheme (and it's only the lack of control over the parser and syntax that forces it to be a compiler at all; all the capabilities are there in JavaScript: closures, first class functions, code as data, etc.). Building DSLs is what this kind of language is <i>for</i>. C and C++ is not for building DSLs, and you don't magically get C performance by converting high level code to low level code.<p>One example is B::C, a Perl to C compiler: <a href=""http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/doc/perldoc-html/B/C.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/doc/perldoc-html/B/C.html</a><p>In short, the CoffeeScript approach is not at all comparable to a high-level to low-level compiler. It is comparable to a, say, Lua to Perl compiler, perhaps. From one very high level language to another very high level language.<p>It's not lack of interest. Weave and Pyrex, which are discussed in this article, are proof positive that people want the speed of low level and the convenience of high level languages. It's just not possible to get it via the means you've described. JITs seem to be the currently fashionable way to get closer to that goal, though it's still miles away.<p>Oh, and there <i>are</i> Lisp compilers that compile to lower level languages like C or compile very fast Lisp. Lisp is quite high level. So, when it goes fast, it is impressive. I'm not knowledgeable enough to know whether they could be used in the same contexts of SciPy, Weave, Pyrex, etc. I imagine there are big math libraries for Lisp, though...and they're probably pretty fast.<p>As for ooc and garbage collection: How would you write a compiler for a high level garbage collected language without including a garbage collector? And, do you believe that garbage collection is the primary reason dynamic languages are slower than compiled non-GC languages? (Hint: It is not. GC is very far down the list of resource users in every garbage collected language I'm aware of.)",1315897122

A few i can remember off the top of my head are:<p>Breastfeeding will often prevent women from ovulating and thus becoming pregnant.  In this way mothers resources are not strained by taking care of too many children at a time and the current child will have a better chance of survival.<p>Fetuses secrete a hormone called human placental lactogen that inhibits maternal insulin,  this leads to high glucose levels in the blood and thus more nutrients available to the fetus it can also result in diabetes in the mother during the pregnancy.<p>preeclampsia (gestational high blood pressure) is another similar effect where hormones excreted by the fetus raise maternal blood pressure in order to increase blood flow to the placenta.<p>Having a fathers testosterone levels fall during early parenting is probably a key evolutionary adaptation because it would prevent fathers from seeking new mates (in order to make more babies and thus spread their genes) in order to care for the new child.  The study noted that testosterone levels later rose when the children became older, this too follows the evolutionary argument because once a child is old enough it is more efficient for the father to attempt to father more children.<p>By far the most interesting part of this section in the book was about male jealousy.  The theory is that because it is fairly difficult for a man to tell whether or not he is raising another mans child.  men have evolved to be overly protective of their chosen mates so that they do not invest to many resources (time included) and thus lower their own genetic viability.  Jealousy, while present in both sexes is a much stronger emotion in men (according to the authors this is true across all cultures).",1315895656

This is for security as cPanel/exim (I assume they're using exim) route mail locally.  This means on a cPanel based shared host I could go setup ""gmail.com"" as an add-on domain, setup a catchall e-mail account and then any e-mail the server is trying to send out to Gmail will get forwarded into my catch-all mailbox. This is a pretty big security hole but unfortunately it's part of most mailservers.  BlueHost is making you verify ownership of the domain in order to prevent from exploiting this security flaw.  Same vein as Google making you verify domain ownership.<p>I understand you're frustrated but I don't really feel you're giving BlueHost a fair shot.  On the other hand they ARE my competition and if you want to try out another cPanel based webhost I'd be happy to set you up with a coupon for some freebies. :)",1315895422

They didn't do it with OS9 because they were trapped by the weight of their legacy, and they ended up making the hard choice of starting from a fresh base to accomplish it.<p>Your implication that somehow real multitasking is some kind of black art that nobody at Apple understands and only exists because they acquired Next is ridiculous.<p>As for iOS, Apple totally made the right call here and introduced it when the hardware and battery became ready.  Did you ever use a G1?  They were ridiculous, even today, Android is a complete mess when it comes to doing a good job of sandboxing apps and their use of CPU.<p>I love Android and have carried one for years, but their biggest wart is just that.  Everybody used to joke that if you used WindowsMobile you had to use a task manager to keep it running, Android isn't far off.  You get a lot of power through its use of multi-tasking, but because they are less strict than Apple you also easily get into a state where your battery lasts for shit.<p>iOS is far, far, stricter in this regard, and it can make it a pain to program to, but the overall user experience is way better.  For the vast majority of apps the user has no idea whether multi-tasking even exists.. all they know is that they leave the app and when they come back things are just as they were.  iOS's strategy of just saving the state and killing everything works brilliantly for 80% of the apps and has made the phone have a fantastic user experience.<p>Yes, they had to evolve to allow background services, and they did, but carefully.<p>Enough with the fanboyism, each platform has its strengths, but make your arguments on reasonable foundations.",1315895286

OSX was the first Apple OS that had modern pre-emptive multitasking, a good 5 years after Windows and decades after Unix.  Pre-emptive multi-tasking just means that the OS divies up CPU time between applications without the applications being aware of it, so many programs can run at the same time without being specifically written to allow this.  Apple was handed multitasking for free in the form of the BSD code OSX is built on.<p>OS9, interestingly enough, had non-preemptive multitasking.  The OS would never take control away from a program, but rather, meekly wait for programs to hand it back.  This meant that multi-tasking could work only so long as all programs you were using were specifically written for it.  In reality, few were, and just one program not written for multi-tasking would seize control and lock out all other programs.  Imagine working on an OS this backwards 5 years after Windows 95 came out!  OS9 was indeed a product of the dark age of Apple.<p>Multi-tasking in iOS is strangely similar to that of OS9 in that it isn't handled by the OS invisibly regardless of how applications are written.  Applications must be written to allow multitasking.  It's not quite as bad as OS9 in that one poorly written application won't bring your iOS device to a screeching halt, but it's still an extremely backwards approach and ample evidence that Apple still doesn't understand multi-tasking.<p>The argument that Apple has deliberately done this because it's good for battery-performance is idiotic.  You don't build the foundations of an OS that could be around for decades around limitations of current generation hardware.  Battery consumption is already a much less important issue than it was two years ago and it will continue to become less and less important since the power efficiency of mobile devices is actually growing faster than Moore's law.  In five years Apples poor implementation of multi-tasking, and all the code written to make use of it, will still be a big mess to clean up.  Even if current generation Android hardware were experiencing poorer battery performance (and they generally don't) because of Android sane implementation of multi-tasking, it would be a small price to pay compared to what Apple has ahead.<p>The real reason Apple has designed iOS this way is, as with OS9, because they just don't know any better.",1315894519

Looking at those facts, it seems pretty clear that the null hypothesis for climate change is that the temperature of the lower atmosphere should be increasing.  We would expect the temperature to rise, <i>unless there is some process that we don't know about that is affecting the numbers</i><p>When we put the hypothesis to the test - is the temperature increasing? - we see that it is indeed increasing, which confirms the model.<p>Now, about those simulations.  Yes, they are not as reliable as the science I just when through above.  We know that.  But they all agree with the null hypothesis that the temperature will rise if we keep increasing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.  If you want to throw that result into dispute, you need to show that there is some process going on that we didn't know about, and hence haven't been included in the models, or you need to show that the simulations themselves are actually wrong.<p>What you can't do, if you want to be scientific about, is just state that you are skeptical about the simulations, and therefore we shouldn't act/create policy based on those simulations.

So as far as a normal user was concerned the OS was incapable of multitasking.<p>So while inaccurate, that statement is not entirely off. You could not create an application and reliably have it do stuff in the background on iOS.<p>Apart from that I have to disagree with your statement: I find the rest entirely reasonable and valid criticism. And I have no doubt about the conclusion: The future of iOS will be more blatant stealing from Android.<p>And that is <i>OK</i>. Really it is. Just stop that nonsense about Apple being the innovator.",1315893848

Usually our moderation system is enough to stop recruiters to add vacuous pages to the wiki. But he went ahead and start spamming the comment pages anyway.<p>Sometimes I wonder if it would be possible to add to job4dev a service that would turn recruiters into a value-add into the recruiting space. But that kind of thing just goes to show that they just want to work as middlemen and really need to be cut out.",1315893847

2990164,comment,2989926,2990131,2,0,buster,,,"When you say ""Multitasking was not an afterthought in this UNIX based OS"" you implicate that iOS multitasking has something to do with the multitasking done on UNIX, which as far as i can tell is really not the case.<p>So, in this regard, iOS was released without multitasking which was baked in some versions later. it's not like they only needed to switch the underlying OS features on.<p>Also: I don't see how this saves battery life if done properly, years before iOS and Android other mobile OS' did multitasking with a similar battery life then the iPhone.<p>The only point that stands is that Apple (may be) didn't want to confuse users with multiple running apps, but then again.. why did they implement it in the end anyway?<p>My opinion: It was obvious that the iphone will have multitasking (and copy&paste and wallpapers, and what not) at _some_ point in the future. Imagine Steve's presentations in the coming years (while announcing a new iPhone/iOS version) without those ""big improvements"". You keep those things hidden to have some new features to throw at your customers.

The relational model doesn't really have room for this. The various flavors of SQL offer bolted-on ways to do this, incompatible & quite different. But it's a living...",1279033155

1511490,comment,1511062,1511352,0,0,photon_off,,,"""A way to create tiny discussions"" was an idea I had for a start-up 3 years ago that I simply never got around to doing.  I think there is a massive potential for such a thing, given that there currently isn't any easy way (that I know of) to create a tiny little forum somewhere quickly and easily.  Right now, the closest thing is creating a post, or a note, or a group on Facebook and having really crappy discussions ensue.  The Facebook discussion system is just awful, and it's a walled garden.<p>I think you should go with the ""tiny discussions"" idea, since I regrettably haven't.<p>There's no maybe about a tour/features/walkthrough... you need it.  You need to adequately describe what your service does and why I should use it.<p>Like I said before, I've been thinking about the commenting space for about 3 years now.  I've watched things like Disqus, Facebook Pages, and Ning pop up well beyond the time I had the idea of simplifying and unifying discussion.  And, still, it seems nobody has managed to nail down the massive market of tiny forums.<p>To put this in perspective, google for virtually any type of forum.  iPod forum.  Nissan forum.  Twilight Forum.  Etc.  The top results you'll get for each of this will be massively popular and lucrative message boards.  Basically, they'll be a good domain name with PHPBB loaded up in them, and that's sufficient to get a critical mass of people using it.  Now, think to yourself:  in the next x years, what new products, movies, brands, etc will be created that will have potential for these similar types of lucrative forums?  You can't know the answer.  But as the future unfolds, the market will know.  And if you could capture some of this market, you'd be in for a lot of traffic.<p>My conclusion is that the best way to go about this is to have users create the forums.  I think there is a lot of money to be made in discussion forums, and user-generated forums is how you guarantee you are the first to capture the market's need for a particular forum.  Think:  A wikipedia of forums.<p>I realize this post might be pretty incoherent and barely related to your weekend project.  Sorry, I haven't eaten breakfast yet.",1279031898

But is this really a problem in practice that leads to performance difficulties in real code?<p>Here's some code I wrote in 2005 that ran into this issue: <a href=""http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:Code/MediaWiki/10549"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:Code/MediaWiki/10549</a><p>> It seems to me that if I'm using a PHP dictionary as an array, I'd know the length, and thus I'd be guaranteed that any access exists.<p>The use case is the common idiom of populating a hash, and then iterating other hashes and checking if their keys exist in the original.<p>In the example above I was loading ~50 files with 1000 key hashes each to check if there were any leftover translation strings in the translated files that weren't in the English original.<p>Because the values could never be NULL I could get away with not using array_key_exists() which reduced the runtime from 60 to 2 seconds. But it's pretty silly that the core datastructures of the language have pitfalls like these.<p>>> This is actually a major problem [...]<p>> Agreed, and it is a huge pain when you want to do something after a request but yet you don't want to tie up the user in the mean time.<p>> I'm not sure I'd want PHP to be a language that makes it easy to have a persistent execution model though; that simplicity (and restriction) is one of the things that has made the language so popular and scalable. PHP's model usually works fine for the kind of web-based problems it's intended for.<p>In some ways, especially the built-in template language. But overall I think PHP as a isn't simple or newbie friendly at all. Its main advantage was that it offered a really simple execution model + Apache module. Which ISPs and others could easily offer along with MySQL, with little administration time compared to offering equivalent shell services.<p>It was also was one of the first to have friendly online documentation with lots of syntax highlighted example code, and comments where people could submit more examples.<p>But as a language it was never very competitive, and due to some of the tradeoffs made PHP never acquired a real community of module writers and re-usability. Thus most large PHP code bases end up being big balls of mud compared to equivalent code written with Catalyst, Django or even Rails.<p>These days it seems to be mostly heading for being a worse Java with more bugs. Unless you have existing code in PHP other languages are probably a better fit for web applications these days.",1279031307

The forum seems nearly abandoned (http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/forum.jspa?forumID=11), and no Amazon employees have responded to any questions. The API has not had any updates in years. Is the Mechanical Turk now a walking corpse?<p>Read on for a description of the problem I've run into. Maybe a fellow enterprising HN reader dealt with something similar and found a solution. :)<p>I need to enforce that the same worker does not look at closely-related images. I can enforce that in my app, and basically show a task that says ""please return this task and try some of our other tasks in a couple of hours"". This is annoying, and drives up the ""returned tasks"" statistic for the workers. I would very much like to make Amazon filter out tasks for users who have run out of valid work in my system.<p>At first, it seemed that Turk qualifications fit the bill. Unfortunately, the Turk system does not support ""negative"" qualification, e.g., it cannot only assign tasks to workers who do <i>not</i> have a particular qualification. Amazon employees have not addressed this question from a year ago: http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/thread.jspa?threadID=32744&tstart=0<p>Then, I tried blocking workers once they run of tasks, and unblocking them once work shows up.

IO is expensive, RAM access is cheap.  The more you can pre-load, pre-calculate, and/or pre-sort stuff and store it in memory, the better (in terms of avoiding expensive IO anyway).  Caching has it's own issues though: if you cache so aggressively that you exhaust physical ram and cause more swapping, you can actually hurt yourself.  Also, you have to deal with the possibility of stale data in the cache, and determining when and how to expire and reload items in the cache.  But still, caching is essential, it's just not necessarily <i>easy</i>.<p>Also, for perspective if nothing else, read the papers and stuff on SEDA (Staged Event Driven Architecture).  There's still debate about how effective the SEDA approach is, but reading the discussion(s) will help you appreciate the issues involved.  <a href=""http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~mdw/proj/seda/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~mdw/proj/seda/</a>",1279029810

How many insert statements might there be, just a rough estimate, in your layer of functions?  My ORM has 1.  At the most basic level, a simple ActiveRecord ORM has 1 insert, 1 update, 1 detele, and 1 select statement.  How many are in your typical app?  If it's more than 1 of each, then it's duplication.<p>I haven't written an insert/update/delete statement in years because I don't need to.  When I need a fancy select that's an aggregate of several tables, I write a view and then map it into a list of objects with the ORM.

1545628,comment,1545325,1545325,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"My wife has dealt with this problem. I did some research and here's what I found.<p>Carbohydrates (and pretty much anything else addictive) are ""crave-inducing"" because of a physiological reaction they cause. It triggers chemicals in your body and brain, not at all unlike cigarettes or other drugs. For refined carbs, it's insulin in the blood, which is followed by serotonin in the brain. The serotonin creates a relaxing effect.<p>It would be easy to engineer any food to have this effect by adding some sort of drug to it. Sprinkle some heroin on broccoli and you'll probably start craving that pretty quickly. Obviously though, you don't want that. What you want is to have no craving at all.<p>There's a good chance that your brain is not producing enough serotonin without the carbohydrates. This could be due to a number of things, lack of sleep, exercise, or even sunlight, too much stress, chronic depression. Sadly eating carbs produces bursts of serotonin followed by a deficit, so it becomes a self-perpetuating cycle. Once some other factor gets you into the cycle, the carbs themselves will keep you there.<p>Assuming there aren't deeper factors at play, the following may help:<p>1. Don't eat any refined carbs for a month. Keep unrefined ones to a minimum as well.<p>2. Get exercise, sleep, and spend time outside where possible.<p>As for #1, it's much easier to accomplish this at the grocery store than at home. A Snickers bar is a lot less difficult to ignore on a shelf at the store than on a shelf in your pantry. Never go to the store when hungry.<p>All of this assumes that you don't have some deeper mental health issue at play. Overeating is often a method of self-sabotage employed by people who are depressed, in which case you may need professional help. But I'd at least try cutting out carbs first because it's free and can't really hurt.",1280069645

The former head of the fda has been writing about how we are biologically predisposed to get even hungrier and crave more when we eat something with fat sugar and salt together. That's why applebees can serve a 1500 calorie appetizer that they know will make you even hungrier. 
So you can make vegetables and fruits a crazy craving by following the same logic.",1280069565

I think one reason is that there are two checks for eating junk food; one, I have to decide to buy it at the store and, two, decide to eat it from the kitchen once I have it.<p>Other things I've done which you might find useful:<p>- replace soda with water: I drank a lot of soda in my teens and early college, but this was one of the easier things to change<p>- have a sugar replacement such as fresh fruit available: if I eat something low in sugar (or maybe carbs in general?), particularly in the evening, then I get cravings for sugar. Eating fruit or toast seems to help this.<p>- go to the grocery store only after eating.

Needless to say it became unmanageable and no-one used it. Real construction is similar in many ways with the development of software. One of the problems is reporting progress, in most cases is like trying to measure microns with a yardstick, the granularity and accuracy of the measuring instrument is not there.<p>On the above Project (a high-rise Tower) we came up with a graphic that had little squares representing activities. The graphic looked similar to the Tower:<p><pre><code>         ---------

         ---------
         | | | | |

Construct, rather than 'cheese'+chip nachos, real cheese(try two or three different kinds of cheese, too), a bit of meat (red meat or poultry..I would not suggest fish nachos) shredded lettuce, onions, etc, etc, etc. Those nachos are rather good for you. Still nachos, likely much more delicious, likely better for you.<p>The ingredients to that can be prepared in large quantities,and used in many other things. Nachos can easily become tacos or burritos, and if you add some loaf bread and leave some meats out, sandwiches.",1280067322

One piece of chocolate isn't bad but if you are hungry it's more likely that you'll want to eat a whole bar.

1545559,comment,1545325,1545325,0,0,mian2zi3,,,"I've always eaten reasonably well (comes from having grown up on a subsistence farm), so I have never radically changed my own diet, but I have a few (untested) thoughts:<p>1. Get some food culture.  It is easier to make good decisions when they are made in a larger context than ""nachos bad vs. carrots good"".  Learn something about: where food comes from, diet and health (particularly in America: I'm assuming you're American), traditional food cultures, basics of cooking.  For me this has meant reading the likes of Fast Food Nation and Michael Pollan, learning to cook some French, Italian and Asian dishes, lots of cookbooks, Alice Waters, Julia Child and other chefs, reading about diet/health studies like The China Study and the Nurses' Health Study, getting myself out to the local farmer's market, but those are by no means the only options.<p>2. Practice what I like to call ""meta-discipline"".  It is hard to control yourself when you're at home with some junk food.  It is easy to control yourself when you're shopping at the grocery store.  So don't buy junk and don't have it at home.  Before you go shopping, be thoughtful about what you want to buy/eat, make a shopping list, and stick to it.  (Usually I think of this in the context of work: it is easy to goof off at home.  It is easy to walk to the library.  It is hard not to work when you're at the library with a stack of math books.)<p>3. The biggest improvement to my diet has come from cooking more.  Mostly, this happened because I moved from a big city with a bunch of awesome restaurants to a little town with no good ones.  I wish I had enacted the change sooner.<p>Good luck.",1280067008

In the 1990s, everyone flocked to ""CS"" school to get in on all the sweet, sweet jobs of the future. Was the aftermath of that fun for anyone?<p>It is often read, on HN, that it isn't enough to just go through the motions of getting a technical degree. You need other qualities to succeed. The person with all the right qualities is rare. True enough. But does this mean that only those rare people with the right qualities deserve to live outside of poverty, or the imminent risk of poverty?<p>My father has a degree in political science. Fortunately, the economy wasn't broken in the 1960s, so he was able to get a white-collar job, buy a house, and have kids, like most other people with ""basic"" college degrees in the 1960s. Back then it was even expected that you could have a decent life with a mere high school diploma, or that GED you mention.<p>That doesn't work so well anymore. Is that a good thing? Be careful what you wish for. We are well on our way to building a society in which you can't have a middle-class lifestyle as, say, an insurance underwriter or medical records clerk without a college degree <i>in a technical or professional field</i>, or maybe an M.S. degree. I think that's a bad idea. Many people have more education than they need, and an increasing number of people have more education than they want (considering that they have to go into debt for it, up front). Forcing unwilling people to struggle through advanced degrees tends to produce a lot of stress and pain, water down the advanced degrees, dilute the pool of degree holders, and waste absolutely <i>enormous</i> amounts of time.<p>Oh, and it produces unnecessary barriers to entry. We could require all hotel administrators to hold an advanced degree in hotel administration. How does that sound to the AirBnB folks?<p>And all it does is buy time. In the end, jobs are as much about the demand for labor as the quality of the supply. Ph.D.s can be unemployed too. Highly trained semiconductor engineers can be unemployed. Automotive engineers are probably not doing so well right now.<p>Shadenfreude has an evil reputation for a reason. Please try to resist the temptation.",1280067006

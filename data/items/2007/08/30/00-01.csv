48053,comment,48024,48024,0,0,mhartl,,,"I suggest using a work timer to remind you to take short breaks every 30 minutes or so.  My favorite timers are xwrits (Linux) and AntiRSI (Mac).  (N.B.  Despite being an X program for wrists, 'xwrits' is not a typo.)  As you can guess from the names, they are principally designed to help with RSI, but they can help with eye pain as well.<p>Here are a couple of things to try during the breaks: (1) count to 30 while focusing on something more than 20 feet away; (2) close your eyes and place your hands over them for a count of 30.<p>I know it's sometimes hard to take breaks when in the throes of a hackathon, but you'll get better with practice.  I try to be really anal, taking breaks even if I'm mid-line; that way, I <i>know</i> I'll get back to work when the break is over.<p>",1188435007

48048,comment,47915,47915,0,0,rokhayakebe,,,"Take it from someone who quit. If you want to climb the corporate ladder than definitely go to college and sell your parents house to finance it. It will be worth it. I've seen it work. If you want to build your own ladder (as what I am doing now), then I suggest you check that college thing again.\nI look around and I see my friends who graduated from school and they all make 1.5 to twice what I make a year, but not for long. The difference shows sometimes in our lifestyle and the way we look at the future. They see title, I see users. They see corporate car, I see users. They see 401k, I see Acquisition. Their biggest dream is to make Project manager or CEO. Fuck it I am CEO, and my wildest dream is to get that call from Sergey  asking me for advices. ",1188434322

If you contact Authorize.NET directly though you will be directed to a sales rep who can disclose rates.<p>Heres a ballpark of what you can expect with them:<p>Merchant Account\n~ 2.4% per transaction + $.25 per transaction + $10/month<p>Payment Gateway\n$100 setup + ~$20 a month and.10 per transaction<p>You will need them for a Payment Gateway, but you may have a merchant account with someone else (for instance Paymentech)<p>I have had good experience with Auth.NET in the past and they seem to be a good value for medium transaction volume ecommerce sites.  <p>",1188434279

I studied electrical engineering, and it was mostly applied mathematics and physics with little systemic perspective.  If I had to do it all over again, I would have studied pure mathematics, comp sci, and physics and built things on my own.  But hey, free is free.",1188432276

Smart-ass doesn't suit you.<p>Obviously, you can use standard DOM methods (e.g. gEBTN, gEBCN) with the ""closest node"" as well.<p>And, assuming you mean an element node, you just bought yourself a world of hurt. jQuery and the like will use the Selectors API (e.g. QSA) when it suits them, and due to their disagreement with the specs, element nodes don't suit them.<p>When they use their own query code, performance and compatibility go right down the toilet.<p>In other words, use QSA with the document node, unless you want to relearn how queries work.<p>> The single biggest performance killer... far more important than tree traversal is event overhead. As long as you think long and hard before applying a new event handler (and use delegation whenever possible) you'll be fine even with those 'Frankenstein' queries hehe :P<p>Again, event delegation is unrelated to queries. It's silly to assume you can use wasteful queries with impunity as long as you don't attach too many listeners.<p>And yeah, those ""Frankenstein queries"" are the exact opposite of self-documenting code (something jQuery proponents get backwards).",1331176356

No shaping, hard or soft quotas, excess usage charges and vague ""fair use"" provisions. The result? You get what you pay for and you pay for what you get. If you pay for 1TB/month on an ADSL line you're absolutely going to get it.<p>The real problem here is a combination of false advertising and people with completely unrealistic expectations. Not everyone can use 73Mbps all the time. There simply isn't the bandwidth for it. If you want to download 100GB+/month you should absolutely be paying more than someone who only downloads 2GB/month.<p>Back to the ""new iPad"" (why not iPad 3? Seriously!), i'm excited about it. Having it be able to do 1080p is great, although I think it's high time they up the flash storage at this point. 64GB doesn't go that far at Full HD.<p>The RAM, CPU and memory upgrades make this a pretty serious device now. The release of iPhoto is probably going to be unfortunately for many photo app makers (and hopefully it'll mean an end to Photoshop Touch's ridiculous 1600x1600 limit).<p>Apple just continues to cement their complete dominance against, well, everyone in the tablet space.",1331176174

Indeed, I find myself perusing nuclearphynance ( the ""chat room"" that a member speculated about Rentec analyzing audio frequencies) often. Somewhat like hacker news, it is full of intellectuals. However, unlike hacker news, everyone there is unabashedly pursuing money.",1197057293

87095,comment,86993,86993,0,0,chaostheory,,,"Overall I feel that the paper is good and accurate...<p>There is one thing that annoyed me though (having used both Python and Ruby extensively):<p>""Ruby and Python are really quite similar. For example, 
Both are strong object-oriented languages.""<p>That is NOT True. OO was probably not part of Python's design from the start. It feels really tacked on when you have to call 'self' everywhere, and try doing inheritance past a parent (to grandparents and so on...); that's when it becomes really obvious that OO was an afterthought in Python, though this may change with Python 3000 (haven't seen it yet)<p>For the record I still feel that Python is a good language (for my C friends), it's just not for me - or for most people i know that like OO",1197056475

87092,comment,86707,86972,0,0,boucher,,,"I did read the article, and what he's really complaining about is words that are ""meaningless"" and ""silly"", and still are not ""catchy"" (oxford: instantly appealing and memorable).  He's most concerned about the fact that the names are not memorable. <p>There is obviously an implied claim that startup names matter to a degree, but I think he makes it clear he doesn't think it's priority number one.  Not to mention, it wasn't a whole article, it was a blog post.  He writes for the Times, and he certainly didn't choose to make this the topic of one of his printed articles.  He certainly isn't the first, nor will he be the last, to complain in his blog that web startup names these days kind of suck.  I'm not naive enough to think David Pogue's blog is anything like mine or most, but it's useful to gain some perspective.",1197055952

However, OAuth seems quite cool if I ever were to do so on a more extensive level (for instance, I've never given facebook access to my gmail account for it to obtain my address book). <p>I'm not keen on OpenID though. At the moment if someone grabbed my facebook password I'd be understandably annoyed. But if someone grabbed my OpenID password, and I used that for lots of sites, I'd be devastated.",1197054790

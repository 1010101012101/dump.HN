Natural gas technology is well developed, highly capable, and already economically competitive with coal and oil. If carbon emissions are an existential threat to humanity, to any degree, we would be stupid not to take advantage of natural gas in the here and now. Switching from gas/diesel/kerosene to natural gas is a >20% reduction in carbon emissions per unit of energy. Switching from coal is a 60% reduction.<p>And natural gas is also better for human health and overall environmental quality since the emissions are almost pure CO2 and H2O without a risk of acid rain, particulates, or radioactive fly ash. Being able to make such huge environmental gains in the short-term at very minimal economic cost is as much of a no brainer as these things get.",1342328217

Why exactly ARE you modeling a book as a series of chapter, section, paragraph, sentence, word objects? Just because you can? Or because it's actually a useful API to developers (the latter seems somewhat doubtful).<p>It's very tempting when you're working with an OO system to actually try and model the data as it corresponds to the real world equivalent, but it's rarely a good idea. Design your code around the API you want other developers to use.<p>In the case of a book, it's unlikely every book will follow that rigid chapter / section / paragraph / sentence  / format (what about a book that doesn't have chapters at all? Or has pictures? Or is stream of consciousness). You'll want a more flexible system - I'd imagine it would end up looking like some kind of markup representation. And no surprise, markup is best dealt with as a nested data structure (XML, JSON), not a rigid set of container classes. So even in this trivial example, a bunch of encapsulated classes aren't really an appropriate representation.<p>This is true more often than not in practice. Rather than building a rigid class hierarchy, having functions that operate on data (and frequently that data _is_ typed) often yields better results.",1342328199

4246174,comment,4245138,4245896,2,0,lsc,,,"eh, in the things I am worried about?  getting sued is pretty far down the list.  I am /far/ more concerned, for instance, about screwing up my taxes.   (probably my biggest fear, as everything else can only take me to zero, in the worst case.  Tax debit is forever.)  Or, of, say, a serious security incident.  That could kill my business and greatly damage my reputation in the process.<p>Eh, but really?  I believe that this ""avoid getting sued at all costs"" attitude in general leads to suboptimal decisions being made in many different areas;  and as a systemic force, it pushes all companies to do things the same way that other companies do them.   ""Industry best practices""  - things like that which are usually code for 'expensive mediocrity'   - I don't even think it makes sense for big companies that are worth suing, usually, but big companies are run by managers, not owners, and managers are far more concerned about avoiding blame than they are about anything else.<p>Really, I think this relative freedom from the fear of lawsuits is a huge advantage I have, and yeah, if I want investors or if I otherwise want to move into management in the corporate world?

4246164,comment,4243008,4243517,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This means that if you are an OS vendor but not the system vendor, you have to do things (aka execute) which allow complete systems (hw + OS) to be brought to market. You have to define a HAL for example, and a way to evolve that HAL, and a way to probe what parts of the HAL need to be implemented in software because the hardware bits are missing. You need to provide a bullet proof schedule (which usually means prioritizing software availability over feature availability) at pre-defined times. You need to have a strong relationship with chipset and other silicon vendors to enable solid device support, which is at least backward compatible and ideally forward compatible as well. You need to be able to work with a hardware partner to get their stuff up and running, you need clear APIs that don't change and solid training materials to bring engineers up to speed. You need to create a series of test suites and compatibility suites to provide confidence on your vendors part that they are doing it right. And perhaps most importantly you should provide legal indemnification for your partners who use your software.<p>When you execute well, all those things are there. When you execute poorly there are parts missing, or parts that are confusing.<p>The result of poor execution is incompatibility flareups, your partners product shipments slip because they haven't had enough integration time, you screw some partners with a release they cannot ever run on their hardware, and your partners take punches in court for you over their decision to use your OS. That's painful.<p>I was working at Google when Android was released and while not part of that team, participated in the early development contests and worked on a 'loaner' G1 to test various things.  That first release with T-mobile was when Google still felt that could release on open source (mostly) OS, and a reference implementation, and the rest of the world could just pick it up and go wild. (this is sometimes referred to as the 'throw it over the wall' strategy). Fortunately, this failed really hard, really fast as evidenced by the pretty sizable gap between the first Android phone and the second. But Google is nothing if not resilient. When I left in 2010 they were still struggling with the notion of 'software releases have timelines' kind of thing because all of Google's other properties just pushed out to their own hardware in their data centers which meant alpha was beta was release all wrapped in one. Not only that but major changes could occur between any step. Hardware partners really really don't like it when you make a major change between one release and the next.<p>Much of the early thrashing in the Android market was due to inexperience on Google's part. The fact that Jelly Bean has been released and Ice Cream Sandwich is hardly anywhere is, in my opinion, and artifact of this learning process.",1342327850

I get a real buzz from creating a clean, elegant solution to a problem: Trying to do that without object-oriented features would be like trying to write a letter by holding the pen with my teeth.

Because of the way the system is organized, there are thousands of packages available for LaTeX which essentially extend the markup language and provide new functionality to the compiler to produce diagrams, for example, or certain alternate PDF formats, etc.  The amount of work done in the LaTeX domain in terms of development is quite amazing.<p>In view of this, is there a way of extending LaTeX in such a way that all this functionality ports over to the creation of more active documents/webpages?",1342326543

Objects are glorified types. They're a bag of state plus a collection of functions which take that state as an implicit parameter. Polymorphism is ""just"" a form of delegation, which itself does not require you to glue together data and functionality.<p>If this were Haskell, you might define a typeclass for a List datatype.<p><pre><code>    class List a where\n      length :: Int\n      get :: Int -> a\n      ...\n</code></pre>\nThen implementors for Heap and Array would do something like this in their respective packages<p><pre><code>    instance List (Heap a) where\n      length x = ...\n      get x i  = ...\n\n    instance List (Array a) where\n      length x = ...\n      get x i  = \n</code></pre>\nAnd so on. Functions which want a List add a type restriction:<p><pre><code>     addListLengths :: (List a) => [a] -> Int\n     addListLengths []     = 0\n     addListLengths (x:xs) = length x + addListLengths xs\n</code></pre>\naddLengths doesn't care if List is a Heap or Array, and calling length on a List will do the right thing.<p>I suspect there are cultural factors at work more than anything else, which does get back to what you say initially: do you prefer to live in the Kingdom of Nouns, or not?<p>In practice, I don't think there's a List typeclass in Haskell. I suspect people generally just use a bog-standard list. :) If you want a special implementation like a heap, you go find one and use it. I suppose this is one example of a cultural of ""explicit is better than implicit.""<p>Myself, I write in Java regularly and I just don't generally see a whole lot of value in the List abstraction over ArrayList or LinkedList or whatever. I suppose the reader can see List and take it as a given that it'll behave in some way. That's something.<p>On the other hand, I suspect the programmers don't think much about a List, either. It's a bit worrisome to contemplate the idea that not only don't programmers know what object they're really dealing with, but they <i>shouldn't</i> know. I highly recommend perusing ""Building Memory-efficient Java Applications: Practices and Challenges""[1], which really gets into this stuff at a technical level.

It's a partially-obfuscated piece of malware, which claims to demonstrate a zero-day (that is, unpatched and previously unknown) security vulnerability affecting Intel Core 2 Duo and Intel Atom processors, allowing privilege escalation from inside a Javascript interpreter up to kernel memory. I don't know whether it actually works, since I'm not brave enough to experiment with it, but it's likely that it does.<p>If this works as advertised, then if you have an affected CPU, it is a zero-day exploit affecting every web browser on every operating system, both desktop and mobile, as long as you have Javascript enabled. Until a workaround has been found, any site which serves you Javascript or any of its advertising networks could use it to give you malware.<p>If you are using Noscript and also blocking Flash, then you are probably safe. To protect yourself, you should, first of all, use ad-blocking software, because ad networks are more likely to distribute malware than the sites they advertise on. Second, you should use only the most security hardened browser, which is Google Chrome; it's not clear whether Chrome's hardening will actually help, but it's likely that it will, and also that it will be the first to have a workaround. And third, you should be immediately suspicious if your browser crashes unexpectedly.",1342325817

4246072,comment,4245737,4246046,1,0,nessus42,,,"Rich Hickey specifically says that his approach makes you more readily adaptable to future requirement changes, rather than less adaptable, as an OO die-hard might claim. I'm not sure I understand how the ""get it right to begin with"" approach fits into the adaptabile-to-future-requirement-changes promise.<p>I see how following OO, as long as you also follow the Law of Demeter, could live up to its promise of helping you adapt to future requirement changes. It has that unfortunate cost, however of requiring you to sometimes write a zillion little delegation methods upfront, which could be quite a combinatorial chore if you don't have the Demeter system automating this for you.<p>Also, I'm pretty sure from listening to a number of Rich Hickey's talks, that he is saying very specifically <i>NOT</i> to hide your data behind an API. Encapsulating the data behind an API would just be the same as the OO approach for all intents and purposes. Hickey is saying to let the data be data. I.e., just data.",1342325128
4246071,comment,4245737,4245737,3,0,6ren,,," - though he has no qualms about misleading and deceptive answers.<p>- <i>""If I understand the input and the output then I have understood the function.""</i>  A good point, I tend to think of ""information hiding"" <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding</a> as applying to state, to enable SOTSOG, but it also applies to pure functions.<p>- <i>""define all my data types in a single include file""</i> That quote sounds silly, but in practice, I find it much clearer if all the part of a data type are next to each other, uncluttered by methods.  It also supports Brooks' observation: ""Show me your tables, and I won't usually need your flowcharts; they'll be obvious"" (""tables"" being datastructures).  In Java, I tried this by defining fields in superclasses, methods in subclasses.  But having two classes per class was awkward.  (I ended up keeping code entirely separate except for very core methods - still not happy with it).  But I don't think this is entirely a language problem, it's partly just complexity management is hard.<p>- this article makes me feel antagonistic, but in fact I never liked OO when taught it; it seemed dogmatic, not actually useful in practice.  But I did like the idea of an ADT, where you can package something up (esp. a list, hashtable etc), and work at a higher level of abstraction.  Subdividing tasks and SOTSOG",1342325113

4246069,comment,4245737,4245925,4,0,martmarc,,,"The ""impedance mismatch"" is not a magical phrase.  It simply refers to the mixing of orthogonal concepts: like trying to fit square pegs into round holes.  Sure, you <i>can</i> do it.  But do you really want to?  You have to admit that the (very old) article/blog who made that term famous saw the issue coming and was right about the current (very sad) state of affair we're in.  It was ""The vietnam war of software development"" or something like that.  The problem when trying to fit square pegs into round holes is that you end up --to use another term that's going to become ""magical"" to you-- with a ""complected"" system.  The ""elephant in the room"" if you wish.  You probably want to watch ""Simple made easy"" by Rich Hickey, the author of Clojure.",1342325086

It will also NOT help you in reading the classics, Ancient Greek, although familiar with modern Greek is one of the most structured but difficult languages to master. Most of the Greek translations from Ancient to Modern are very bad pieces works that don't give justice to the original text -good translations exist but I am afraid they are not the best sellers when it comes to the classics.<p>What I would recommend is the series ""LOEB"", they have the original text and one of the best English translations available.

Sure the functions of the iPhone were all (mostly) present in competing devices when it launched, but it was hard(er) to leverage them on Windows Mobile or Blackberry because the interface wasn't nearly as polished and easy to use.

If you know you have a higher LTV for females for your app between the ages of 18-34 and you do a portion of your advertising on Facebook, it would be good to target just those users.<p>2) Insights into broad customer engagement.  Let's say your 18-34 female users return to your application more often than male users in the same demographic, it'd be helpful to know what friction points cause these users to drop off.<p>3) Insights into spending users.  Being able to segment all your user actions by those who are free and those who spend money would help you optimize your paying funnel.<p>4) Bug reporting.  Knowing where your users are located can help illuminate whether you have server and localization problems.<p>I can't think of any reasons why you'd use this information to voluntarily contact users other than support-related issues.

Most languages, especially those PHP is based on, do not do that.  Maybe one day PHP will have that but because it's weakly typed, it's difficult to know even what methods should exist.  In PHP, it's perfectly reasonable to say strlen(1).  Does that mean every number should have string methods?  I'm guessing you never considered that?<p>> The problem with mysql_escape_string was that it didn't take the current database handle into account.<p>Yes, because the encoding properties of the current database connection are needed for encoding properly.  If have two database connections, then what?  It picks the first connection as the default and you encode incorrectly?  Or if you had a second connection, do you just break all the existing code?  What if the second connection doesn't happen every time?  Then you're code is broken only every second Wednesday?<p>You've got a very singular perspective on things.  That's fine.

4191156,comment,4188428,4189258,1,0,cbsmith,,,"> There's no shame in programming in high level languages to deliver more value more quickly. Ditto with operations, ditto with everything.<p>Agreed. That isn't the same as the ""don't want to know how the system works"" mentality. High level languages are great tools for ""encoding and automating processes you understand so you Don't Repeat Yourself, or perhaps Don't Need To Do It The First Time"". They are great for ""making all the initial decisions for you so you can get started and come back to those later"".<p>They are horrid tools for ""allowing you to be ignorant"".<p>Now, I don't think everyone should know everything about computer systems (heck, just asking someone to know everything about C++ is a tall order ;-), and I certainly don't think you should have memorized all the configuration logic for hardware and software. However, if you are a technology professional, you really should see a key part of your professional value as your understanding of as much of how the system functions as possible. The understanding will never be total; it will never be complete; it ought to be an area of concern.<p>If it isn't, you aren't an technology professional. You might be an entrepreneur. You might even be a great product designer. You aren't an engineer.<p>That might sound like it is about semantics. It isn't. Computer systems are basically towers of babel where each brick is another leaky abstraction. Engineers are the people who build, maintain, and replace that tower. You can't do the job well if you only know about the roof.<p>Entrepreneurs have such a huge challenge just searching for a viable business model, that they tend to see all other problems as irrelevant. While the problems are usually smaller, possibly even trivial by comparison, they aren't irrelevant. If you are a tech company, doing technology right is more than just a tiny bit relevant.<p>Think of it this way: SQL provides a tremendously high level of abstraction to data systems. This makes it terribly efficient for quickly coming up with queries you want answers for. However, if something ever goes wrong, or if you are writing application code that is going to be run over and over again, you want someone who understands a lot more about the system than just how to translate a question in to SQL. That goes double if somehow the query is vital to your business' ongoing operations.",1341265013

I think what you mean is 'Model2 is dead...'. MVC is great for any environment where the observer pattern can be implemented (eg web front-end).<p>The biggest problems I've seen in model 2 architectures is weak models. The side effect of this is everything gets stuffed in the controllers. This is understandable because there is no observer pattern and therefore the models don't have nearly the power they do in real MVC.<p>Heres a great explanation of the MVC[1]:<p><i>In a nutshell the classic MVC architecture work like this. There is a model that is at the heart of the whole thing. If the model changes, it notifies its observers that a change occurred. The view is the stuff you can see and the view observes the model. When the view is notified that the model has changed, the view changes its appearance. The user can interact with the view (e.g. clicking stuff) but the view doesnt know what to do. So the view tells the controller what the user did and assumes the controller knows what to do. The controller appropriately changes the model. And around and around it goes.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://michaux.ca/articles/mvc-architecture-for-javascript-applications"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaux.ca/articles/mvc-architecture-for-javascript-a...</a>",1341262998

Router interfaces are clunky, inconsistent, and not very user-friendly, but they're hard to improve because they're quite constrained by the limited resources on the router and the difficulty of pushing out firmware updates.  If the UI were in the cloud it would be easier to provide a really nice experience and start offering new features.<p>For instance, Marshini Chetty, a researcher at Georgia Tech, has been working on a project called Kermit[1] to provide increased visibility into home networks, mainly to provide QoS (e.g. you can determine your teenager is hogging the bandwidth with video streaming and throttle him back).  However their system generates a lot of data, too much to process on the router itself, so IIRC they schlep it over to a PC running on the network.  If this were coupled with a cloud service, you wouldn't need to keep a PC running all the time.  I'm not sure how much of a market there really is for this, though in a presentation she said they had done a study where they put these in average people's homes and received a positive reception.<p>On a different note, I find the outrage about this (both here on HN and elsewhere) somewhat ironic because the privacy policy isn't that different from the privacy policies people put up with everyday with other cloud services they use.  I think it's just when it's put in contrast with the status quo of routers (not in the cloud and with good privacy guarantees) that people find it outrageous.

It doesn't work as well as it was intended to, because, despite the idealistic ""rule of law, not men"" rhetoric, laws are just abstract concepts, and the world is always under the control of people, who will game and manipulate any system of rules to their advantage.  If you build an institution and give it enough power, the people who run it will eventually find a way around their constraints.",1341262948

Your tutorial, however, is not compatible with the suggested server experience where Apache is not installed, as Node has updated to v0.8 and not only deprecated but removed the ""sys"" module in favor of the ""util"" module.

I've simply resigned myself to editing the one line it takes to complete the tutorial every step of the way...

You don't get to decide who people's friends are. 30 years ago people had all kinds of friends they only got to communicate with on the phone and through letters. Non-face-to-face friendships (and romantic relationships) have existed since we had semi-reliable postal services.

One will lose those arguments, in a flamboyantly destructive fashion, and the next time one makes well-founded arguments such as ""Corporate outings at a strip club are not appropriate"", one will be remembered as some variant of an ""implacable harpy who would be equally offended if the meeting had mentioned Dungeons and Dragons.""<p>P.S. I am probably not the guy who you'd want as your #1 ally on this issue, but I know that guy, and he literally has Warhammer tattoos.

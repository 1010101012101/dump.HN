247564,comment,247239,247257,0,0,jcl,,,"Agreed... The idea isn't bad, but this particular implementation is.<p>If the challenge of your captcha is parsing 3D images, there's no need to make the label letters a tiny unreadable magenta.  In fact, you don't need letters at all -- this is merely an artifact of the ""enter text for an image"" structure of current captchas.  It would be far better to have clickable target squares in the image, and just use JavaScript to ask the user to click on several targets in succession -- which is maybe even easier than text-based captchas.  Using JavaScript has the additional advantage that it won't fit as well within existing captcha-forwarding spammer frameworks.",1216216452

247562,comment,247239,247396,0,0,lbrandy,,,"> > Object recognition is a completely unsolved computer vision problem.<p>It's funny you quoted that part. I can't tell you how many ""next-gen"" captchas I've broken trivially with the object recognition software our company has developed (<a href=""http://demo.pittpatt.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://demo.pittpatt.com</a>). Granted, our software is useless against this type of Captcha, but many aren't.<p>Captchas have become a really interesting area of research for us because it's essentially the opposite problem that we are trying to solve. What's really curious about this is object recognition people seem keenly aware of the advancements in Captcha design and Captcha designers seem blissfully ignorant of the advances in object recognition.<p>I've seen so many proposed ""next-gen"" captchas that I could break before I finished reading their powerpoint slides.",1216216385

It's clearly not short-sighted then.<p>In addition, up until the recent gas price increase, there was a perceived tradeoff between living in a small apartment in the center of a city, or living in a larger, cheaper house in the suburbs. The total cost of car+house was generally perceived as paying less for more versus the inner-city apartment.<p>Finally, if you have children, there's going to be tons of activities (sports, summer camp, etc.) that basically require a car. It's an investment in their future.",1216215630

247547,comment,247160,247383,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"There is useful information about advisers. Perhaps not as much as is desirable, but certainly enough to avoid making bad choices. Very important: what happened to their old students?<p>My adviser: all students got academic jobs (some multiple offers) and finished in 5 years (5 years from B.S. to Ph.D. is normal for math). The most recent student, with whom I had overlap, said he rocked.<p>Another adviser I considered: fastest student took 6 years. One student took 9.5 years, and told everyone ""pick a different adviser"". Several never graduated. I scratched him off my list.<p>As for the ""three dates"", it's not optimal, but you can eliminate some bad choices. If the guy forgets to show up for ""date #2""? He'll probably do that a lot. He probably doesn't care. One guy (perfectly decent fellow) was very formal, which doesn't really work for me. Several women students mentioned to me they want someone encouraging. The point of the meetings is to judge whether your personalities are compatible.<p>There is information out there, but lots of people don't actively seek it out. Then they become miserable grad students. One guy in my year ignored the advice of ""9.5 years"", and went on to become a miserable grad student (and now a happy actuary with an M.S.).<p>I had a fantastic adviser, which might have been luck. I had an adviser who didn't suck, which was the result of good choices.",1216215169

I think it stems from the fact that most people totally abhor the concept of being thought of as common. Not everyone can be a leader--hell, if that were the case nothing would get done. Really though, there is nothing wrong with being an ordinary working citizen. If you have a hobby, pursue it in your free time.

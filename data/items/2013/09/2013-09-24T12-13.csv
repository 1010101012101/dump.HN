For every famous programmer who cares about recognition and does open-source stuff to get her name out there, there&#x27;s a great programmer who cares more about getting paid to do awesome things, and isn&#x27;t particularly concerned with public recognition.  There are thousands of astoundingly good programmers who you have never heard of, and many of them are working on closed-source projects.",1380027573
6437557,comment,6437195,6437453,2,0,Terretta,,,"Went to Maker Faire NYC this weekend.  Feel the same about the term.<p>It should have been called 3D Printer Faire. If not that, then Kit-maker Faire.  There was less &quot;making&quot; on display than at a typical arts and crafts festival, and much more commercialization of RTA kits than I&#x27;d expected.<p>Also, I feel like Rasberry Pi should only come after Arduino which should only come after one of these: <a href=""http://www.ebay.com/itm/Radio-Shack-CK1000-Basic-Electronic-Parts-Kit-/251343548006"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ebay.com/itm/Radio-Shack-CK1000-Basic-Electronic-...</a>. (Not the 150 in one project kits, actual components.) Start with hacking things from sensors and transistors before programming chips.<p>As an example, on the linked &quot;maker news&quot; site, the home page currently has a headline about flickering a household bulb like a candle with Arduino, <a href=""http://flowcon.us/td/hwmach/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flowcon.us/td/hwmach/</a>.

That was what I was reacting to. I don&#x27;t think it is ever a good thing to shoot yourself in the foot. You can invest in your children without undermining your own welfare. It does not sound like that is what this man did. He gave a lot of money to his kids and apparently now is (or feels) impoverished.<p>Context matters. By itself, I would agree with your sentiment. But in the context here, it sounds like you are saying &quot;You should cut your own throat to &#x27;invest&#x27; in your kids!&quot; There are a lot of people who really believe things like that.

6437552,comment,6434609,6434609,3,0,kohanz,,,"HFT (high-frequency trading) is a buzz-word that&#x27;s being thrown around, but what I think you&#x27;re really asking is whether <i>automated</i> trading is possible for individual investors.<p>The infrastructre and costs of HFT (hardware, co-location, etc.) are enormously high and as far as I know only institutions can compete on this level. However, if you have an algorithm that has an edge that does not depend on millisecond level execution, you&#x27;re just talking about automated trading and this is very achievable by an individual.<p>Many brokers offer APIs to service this market. For example, Interactive Brokers has a commonly used API that has a sizable community of people working with it.<p>About 6 years ago, I developed an automated trading system with a friend who was a self-employed day trader at the time. It was a very interesting project and quite successful for a while. However, as time passed, markets changed and so did the profitability of our algo. At our peak we were doing 10k profit/month after commissions, but it was short-lived.<p>There are several communities, such as at IB, or Elite Trader, to discuss the topic of automated trading, but don&#x27;t expect the helpful atmosphere you get here. It&#x27;s an extremely competitive environment (even though you&#x27;re almost never directly competing with the small-time investors who post on those forums) and there is much more misinformation and trolling than there is useful reading.",1380027452

6437538,comment,6436719,6436719,6,0,detcader,,,"Skimming the article I see no mention of COINTELPRO, of which these programs are no doubt a continuation of at least spiritually. This would make sense given that this is the NY Times, and bringing up COINTELPRO would perhaps force them to admit racial/xenophobic dimensions and roots to these recent revelations (e.g. the USG&#x27;s history of targeting civil rights and anti-war activism), instead of white guys fighting for other white guys&#x27; iPad Privacy..<p>>Swartz argued that it was sometimes necessary to break the rules that required obedience to the system in order to avoid systemic evil.<p>That paragraph would have been a perfect place in which to touch on the Church Committee and its origins. Does the author even know about it?<p>Honestly, most people with social power and influence don&#x27;t seem to care about the revelations because they don&#x27;t. They have nothing on the line -- their rights will never be threatened, nor will government programs like the endless War on Terror ever affect them (in ways that they will understand; &quot;blowback&quot; is evidently too intricate of a concept for most).

I used to write bots for a popular online game that would harvest materials and sell stuff in the games auction house. At first I only wanted to automate some tedious, boring tasks in the game, but over time I got really good at it to the point where I wouldnt have to touch my guy for days. Anyway, there where lots of bots on my servers and we would all undercut each other to a point where our materials where worth almost nothing. Around this time the company released an API where you could pull auction house data for your server. I wrote some scripts that would pull the data, store them in redis and crunch some numbers that I would later feed to my bots, to gain some advantage. Basically, I was able to withhold my stock when the price reached a certain threshold and buyout all of my competitions stock at super low prices.  By that time I had already &quot;scaled up&quot; and ran several instances on various servers, all full automated by some python scripts. I wrote a web socket based web interface that allowed me to see my bots log messages in real time from work. I set up alerts when game masters messaged so I was able to answer them to prove that I was not a bot, all remotely. It was so much fun. At the end of each month I would sell the in-game currency to some chinese companies, the last few months I made between 300-500  / month, double that amount around christmas.

By the time the other programmers told me the specs, over the office space, and started debating how long many days it should take, I was done (so roughly 1h).<p>Another point they make is that a group of people can generate compounded productivity. I live the exact opposite. 
Right now I&#x27;m sitting in an office with friendly people, and I roll my thumbs in boredom, but at night I work 1h for select clients and do more than in a week at my day job.<p>The only problem is loneliness. I hardly ever met anyone who enjoys multiple subjects (maths/physics/software/networks/biology/literature and capital management for me mostly), in fact I mostly receive jealousy disguised as mockery. 
Heck, I learned not to talk about seemingly arcane languages (Racket, LUA and the like) otherwise I&#x27;m cataloged and have to fight ridiculous prejudices. I found the best solution is to appear dumb.<p>Discrepancy between expectation of programmer productivity and the reality of one programmer can be very deceiving.",1380025644

The existing system allows an appeals court to decide AFTERWARD whether the recusal decision was appropriate (although the judge is given a great deal of latitude and only egregious cases would be overruled). They can then order a new trial.<p>I am not sure I agree with this: it seems to me that a quick ruling could be made on recusal and that it would arise quite rarely. But I&#x27;m not familiar with the system, and the lawyers I have heard from are. I suppose if judges are nearly always making good choices about when to recuse themselves the system should work fairly well.",1380024665

6437366,comment,6434400,6435609,1,0,msandford,,,"Basically I&#x27;m trying to draw out the differences and similarities.<p>In meatspace private property is default-closed (with certain exceptions) but some ability to in good faith.  For example I can walk on your land to walk up to your front door and knock.  You could then tell me I need to leave or you&#x27;ll call the police.  This is how it&#x27;s worked for a long time and thus we think it&#x27;s normal.  You have this right even without building a fence around your property.  Again, default-closed.<p>On the &#x27;net the same rules of private property don&#x27;t apply because the default on the &#x27;net tends to be default-open.  What I mean by this is that the simplest configuration for any webserver tends to have no access controls.  So it&#x27;ll serve up whatever it can to whoever asks.  Furthermore the default on the internet for a long time was everyone can access everything since it was originally designed for precisely that purpose: sharing knowledge.  The internet defaults to a street.<p>If you want to make your internet site NOT like a street (which is what it defaults to) you have to take steps to make that happen because HTTP doesn&#x27;t have the mechanisms built in to do so.  You have to build your access control on top of HTTP.  If you do not, I would argue that we are right to assume that you meant for it to be a street for two reasons.  First is that&#x27;s how HTTP works and we&#x27;ve got some 20 years of history backing this up.  Second is that to argue otherwise would place an incredible burden on everyone to have to divine the intent of the person/organization that served up the page.<p>What I&#x27;m getting at is to argue that weev &quot;should have known better&quot; strikes me as really nuts.  In meatspace it would be like secretly passing a new law that divvied up all the roads to the landowners that border them so that I own the street in between my lot-lines and up to the middle of the road.  Nobody knows about this so everyone keeps driving and nobody&#x27;s the wiser.  Then a real douchebag drives down the road in front of a rich guy&#x27;s house.  He hates it so he calls the cops and because he&#x27;s rich and influential the DA manages to dig up this secret law and prosecute the douchebag with it.<p>If that law were to become non-secret and enforceable it would turn the world upside down in the US as nobody would be able to drive anywhere, walk anywhere, or generally do anything without the express permission of all the millions of people who now own the streets, sidewalks, etc.  Even if you live in a big city and you could take the subway (which perhaps is still public) you wouldn&#x27;t be able to walk to it unless the entrance happened to be on your land.<p>I think this would clearly be insanity as it would turn however many hundreds or thousands of years of convention on it&#x27;s head.  And to me, this is what the prosecutors are trying to argue.  I understand that they probably don&#x27;t really understand the technical aspects of it but to me it&#x27;s really clear and their arguments sound like nonsense.  But that&#x27;s because we&#x27;re looking at it from completely different viewpoints.",1380024512

It&#x27;s not a convenient option.<p>> According to Popper&#x27;s definition.<p>Karl Popper didn&#x27;t invent falsifiability, he discovered it. But I see you have a very common belief that falsifiability is optional, and that things can be called science that don&#x27;t have this essential property. So let&#x27;s do a thought experiment in which falsifiable theories aren&#x27;t required -- let&#x27;s see where this takes us.<p>Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m a doctor and I&#x27;ve created a revolutionary cure for the common cold. My cure is to shake a dried gourd over the cold sufferer until he gets better. The cure might take a week, but it always works. My method is repeatable and perfectly reliable, and I&#x27;ve published my cure in a refereed scientific journal (there are now any number of phony refereed scientific journals). And, because (in this thought experiment) science can get along without defining theories, I&#x27;m under no obligation to try to explain my cure, or consider alternative explanations for my breakthrough  I only have to describe it, just like a psychologist.<p>Because I&#x27;ve cured the common cold, and because I&#x27;ve met all the requirements that psychology recognizes for science, I deserve a Nobel Prize. Yes or no?<p>Ask yourself what&#x27;s wrong with this picture, and notice that the same thing is wrong with psychology  all description, no explanation, no established principles on which different psychologists agree, no effort to build consensus, and no unifying theories.<p>> You give only one test for what is a science and ignore all the others.<p>There is only one test. It&#x27;s a matter of common sense, philosophy, and law. The definition I gave, and provided references for, is written into the law, for a number of reasons including people&#x27;s desire to keep religion out of public school classrooms. The Discovery Institute, that hotbed of Creationism, make the same argument you&#x27;re making -- science isn&#x27;t strictly defined, it&#x27;s all a matter of opinion, and Evolution is just a silly idea cooked up by some eggheads.<p>> I don&#x27;t know why you have singled out psychology and psychiatry for this treatment.<p>Easily explained. Sociologists and astrologers aren&#x27;t scientific, but they don&#x27;t have clinics and they don&#x27;t mislead parents and children, invent imaginary illnesses for them to have. Physicists are scientists, but they don&#x27;t have clinics and they don&#x27;t presume to treat your ills. Doctors have clinics, but they&#x27;re reasonably scientific, and when they&#x27;re not, they can be sued within an inch of their lives, sometimes even thrown in jail.<p>Psychiatrists and psychologists are in a class by themselves -- they masquerade as scientists, some ill-educated people think they&#x27;re scientists, psychiatrists can dispense rather dangerous drugs, but neither they nor psychologists are remotely scientific. And best of all, they don&#x27;t have to accept adult responsibilities.<p>Rebecca Riley was diagnosed with bipolar syndrome and ADHD at the age of two, with the encouragement of her parents, who were already making $30,000 per year from Social Security payments for their other children, diagnosed earlier with bogus mental illnesses and already a walking gold mine. But Rebecca was their finest moment, and that of her psychiatrist. Rebecca died at age four from the drugs her parents and psychiatrist encouraged her to take.<p>Her parents were convicted of murder. Her psychiatrist is still practicing. Sort it out for yourself.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Riley"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Riley</a>",1380024298

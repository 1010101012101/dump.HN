168659,comment,168338,168338,0,0,vesterr,,,"DHH by far and that isn't to say the others weren't good, just that his was stellar by comparison.  In other years PG might have won -- nothing wrong with it, it was pretty good, just that DHH was stellar.<p>Some of the top points for me (my interpretations):<p>1) Rails - first version was 1000 lines.  You don't have to make something gargantuan that solves every problem as a first version!<p>2) Rails was a means to an end, something used in the process of making something REAL.  It wouldn't work as a day job, it would be horrible to just work on a framework all the time.<p>3) If you only HAVE 2 hours a day, working on it is something to <i>look forward to</i> (my inference), whereas if you have all day every day you procrastinate.  Don't expect yourself to work on it all the time, it's not realistic.<p>4) Reverse terror alerts -- SO much coverage given to the one in a million success stories that we subjectively feel it's much more likely than it is.  We are brainwashed with overexposure.  The odds are much better of building a small business, and of course there's nothing preventing you from selling that anyway.  I suppose it's like flipping a house -- make it someplace nice and live in it and you can enjoy it, and that doesn't stop you from selling it later if you want.  If you are focused on flipping it then it becomes kind of an albatross because you're too attached to a low-probability outcome that depends on other people, which makes you a bit desperate and unable to enjoy the process, which just becomes an interminable wait.<p>5) Calling the shots, running at your own pace -- not having to ""yes, massa"" and do what your investors tell you.<p>6) Having a bunch of small customers vs. one huge one means you don't have to placate some fussy demanding customer or risk losing the account and all your income.  If a small customer isn't worth it, you can refund and let them go.",1208721389

168656,comment,152836,153456,0,0,johnm,,,"Indeed, a lot of the services touted as RESTful are less RESTful and more RPCish.<p>REST has certainly become a fad term that's used to hype that anti-SOAP juggernaut and that's led to a lot of confusion since so many of the folks doing the yapping don't really understand REST.<p>Your confusion (whether you've read Roy's dissertation or not) seems to be a fairly common one for people coming from an experienced RPC mindset.  I had a similar conversation at SDWest after my talk on REST with a SOAPer -- he too was missing the point that terms like ""document"" and ""resource"" are much more abstract in REST than what the general English meaning implies -- particularly to people who's existing experience with RPC approaches like SOAP and CORBA before that gives them a very different and, arguably, much more concrete terminology for RPC.",1208721007

They didn't give her money for the prototype.<p>What about people who patent ideas and then either sell the patent to an IP holding company or collect money from violators?

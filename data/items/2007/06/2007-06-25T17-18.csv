30560,comment,30513,30514,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"I am the poster of this article: I found this particular article actually exciting.  Why?  I had no idea Verizon was laying fiber directly to customers and allowing all that bandwidth to be used at a very reasonable cost.  I was very dissappointed, though, when I found out that the service is not yet available for my location.  The big news for startups here:  cheaper bandwidth! (maybe its available at your location?), and potentially a growing base of users with large bandwidth which will change the kinds of services that can be provided.",1182794240

Healthy people in their 20s really don't have many medical expenses - I think the last time I went to the doctor was a year and a half ago, and it cost about $150 (through a COBRA mixup, my coverage didn't start until the month after I needed it, but they refunded my check for the month I wasn't covered and I ended up saving like $200 by <i>not</i> being covered).  If there are serious problems, that's what the catastrophic insurance is for.",1182793846
30558,comment,30513,30554,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"I guess I am the ""guilty"" party in your complaint here.  The reason I submit all in a row as I do is when I'm reading my daily news (typically in the morning) and see something relevant for YC, I submit it. This is why you'll get several from me in a row, especially since there aren't that many up at 5am or so posting.  This is also typical of a few others.    ",1182792571

30553,comment,30490,30506,0,0,jey,,,"We should expect that a piece like this will draw conclusions that are ""simplistic"" over-generalizations; she is going for mass generalizations that <i>do</i> have a point, but some significant data will be smoothed over in the process. She is describing high-level patterns, not specifically addressing each subgroup. Note that she does address the distinctions between the subgroups within ""subaltern"", e.g.:<p>""<i>I should note here that aesthetics do divide MySpace users. The look and feel that is acceptable amongst average Latino users is quite different from what you see the subculturally-identified outcasts using. Amongst the emo teens, there's a push for simple black/white/grey backgrounds and simplistic layouts. While I'm using the term ""subaltern teens"" to lump together non-hegemonic teens, the lifestyle divisions amongst the subalterns are quite visible on MySpace through the aesthetic choices of the backgrounds.</i>""<p>
Also, you asked ""<i>when did you last meet a working class art fag?</i>"". I'll bet most ""art fags"" are not getting rich off of it.",1182791651

For instance, if you really get a lot of submissions, you could pre-select probably-interesting posts with a text classifier and shunt them into a probably-interesting queue. (A text classifier could be something like the ones used in spam filters, or, if you want, you can throw the whole machine learning book at it and use Markov chains, neural networks, &c.)

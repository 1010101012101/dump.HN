Which is to say it didn't appear as a link on the front page, in fact I didn't find any inlinks to it until this story broke and those are from blogs etc. And it was posted by an account created to post that one link on HN (not like Dr. Mann or someone who regularly participates here stumbled across it and tried to link it.)<p>Now if Dr. Mann had a running blog about life as a cyborg or his thoughts on wearable computing, and this just happened to come up in that blog as ""Oh the saddest thing happened ..."" then it might feel more natural. It has since been converted to a one-entry wordpress blog.<p>As I've said elsewhere, we'll see what the next steps are. Eyetap has certainly gotten a lot of publicity out of the deal so I expect the press will follow up on any fallout here as well.",1342504782

I use Ubuntu myself and am most definitely not bickering about Fedora.<p>However, the Linux market is already fragmented. And even worse, it is deeply religious. Just google for the bickering that ensued when Meego chose rpm over deb. People have already started talking about why not Arch, etc.<p>The point that you are missing is that, if anyone could unify the Linux fragmentation it is Valve. Steam is a killer app, and I can totally see people migrating towards a distro built around it (and laptops certified for it).<p>I want Valve to succeed - how will it succeed in a severely fragmented market ? Can it justify the cost of its Linux team then ? Android is having a similar problems in version fragmentation. People have posted articles here on how they are unable to justify multiple version (distro?) development.\nMultiply that problem by a thousand - different audio toolkits, poor driver compatibilities.\nI am not able to see how they are going to succeed, unless they unify <i>atleast</i> the multimedia toolkits (something like CoreAudio)",1342504778

Sleep disruption with a new baby is a big thing and you can't just shrug that off.  It takes weeks usually to adjust.<p>Of course there are times when you do soldier on and do what you have to.  I got a call from a customer one Wednesday saying ""We know your second kid was just born last week, but we need you onsite on Monday.  Is there any way you can do this?""  The deal was the technical contact on their side was quitting, and they needed help ensuring a smooth transition for the project.  It was essentially an emergency that needed to be addressed and there wasn't anyone else I could send to do it.  And so I talked to my wife, and we decided to rent a minivan and drive 20 hours each way (over a weekend, approx 10 hrs/day) to the customer's site with two kids (one 4 one almost two weeks old), and let them know we'd need a bit extra for accommodations and travel.  But even there....  the work I could do on-site was reduced.  It was an important visit and it made a world of difference for the customer, but I wouldn't say I was at the peak of my ability.  And it worked out much better than me just flying there and back.  The newborn was easy to deal with in the car.  I could still help out at night, etc.  And my wife really enjoyed the drive (we got back and she said next time her mother came to visit we should do a road trip again!).<p>But at the same time, if it wasn't for the ""down-time"" during the drive, it would have been pretty miserable all around (we traded off driving every three hours too, to better manage fatigue).<p>But I wouldn't suggest doing more than the minimum during this time.

When I boot off of that iso, I want a menu that asks me this:<p>[ ] Desktop<p>[ ] Server<p>[ ] Embedded<p>[ ] Custom<p>This ultimately comes down to a user interface issue, but it's different than the kind of user interface often associated with the HN crowd. It's more like an API user interface, be that a web or programming library API. A crucial feature of good APIs is 'graceful degradation' in terms of easiness/control. Take a look at the libcURL library[1]. cURL has 3 levels of access: ""easy,"" ""share,"" and ""multi."" If you don't care about a lot of features and just want to download a webpage, the easy interface will get you what you want in a few lines of code. If you have something more complicated, you can go all the way down to the multi interface to access many of the raw functions of the API.<p>They key takeaway is giving the user control of her complexity level. If I'm a sysadmin compiling an image meant to be deployed on thousands of servers, then something like Arch would be pretty great -- I can fine-tune things how I want. If I'm just a random developer, then I would like to stick to 'sane defaults,' with the option to revisit those defaults later if needed.<p>I really don't care what cron I have, don't force me to pick one against my will.<p>[1] <a href=""http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/</a>",1342501756

The 2-3 hour lunch period is the primary window, but many trucks also do a dinner service for 2-3 hours.<p>In addition to the service window, there's several hours at the start of the day dedicating to stocking the truck and prepping the food so that it simply needs to be cooked.  At the end of the day, leftovers must be disposed and all of the equipment must be cleaned. Both prep and cleanup will take several hours: prep will usually take 3-4 hours, and cleanup will 2-3 hours.<p>On top of that, there's the transportation time for getting from home base to the day's location(s).  In L.A., most trucks operate out of a San Fernando lot, which means 1-2 hours transit time to get to their lunch spot.<p>All told, the employees may get 8 hour shifts, by the truck managers and owners will be lucky if they work fewer than 12 hours a day.<p>Sources:<p><a href=""http://clatl.com/atlanta/a-day-in-the-life-of-an-atlanta-food-truck-mixd-up/Content?oid=5484599"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clatl.com/atlanta/a-day-in-the-life-of-an-atlanta-foo...</a><p><a href=""http://www.findlafoodtrucks.com/blog/tag/nom-nom-truck/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.findlafoodtrucks.com/blog/tag/nom-nom-truck/</a>\n<a href=""http://www.sacramentopress.com/headline/6599/Food_trucks_A_day_in_the_life"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sacramentopress.com/headline/6599/Food_trucks_A_d...</a><p><a href=""http://mobile-cuisine.com/business/breaking-into-the-food-truck-industry-%E2%80%93-part-4/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mobile-cuisine.com/business/breaking-into-the-food-tr...</a><p><i>Komodo, one of the grandaddies of the modern food truck industry, used to have a great post on this but it appears that they have deleted that post.</i>",1342501726

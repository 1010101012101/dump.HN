The relationship status of the people has nothing to do with it.  Men are instinctively predisposed to helping women.  Women can and do take advantage of this, and generally don't recognize or acknowledge that they are doing so.  You don't see it, because you've lived it your entire life and it is normal.<p>How many times has a woman put a new water bottle in the water cooler here?  I know the exact number, because it is zero.  All of the women here are fully capable of doing it, yet they ask men to do it.  And how often do men say no?  This is very obvious when looking at tasks that are considered stereotypically ""men's work"" like lifting something, but it applies just as much to anything else.<p>I've watched my wife get men to do her work for her several times.  She simply asks them to do it, and they say yes.  When I point it out to her, she insists that they would have done the same for a man, and that had she asked a woman they would have done it for her too.  Yet, she never asks another woman to do it, and I know I sure wouldn't do it if a man were asking me.  She is taking advantage of being female, and it is so deeply ingrained that it comes naturally and she doesn't recognize that she's doing it.",1351875599

I think this is an incredibly impressive accomplishment, and SpaceX's ambitions to make it possible to do manned missions to Mars is exactly what we need to bring humanity forward. Just from the science side alone, having actual people on Mars would be of tremendous value. If you think of what we know about Mars, think about how much more we would know if we were able to do more complex experiments there. Whether you personally think it's a good idea to settle down on Mars or not isn't very relevant.<p>You're pointing at some very relevant issues, but why not phrase it in a more constructive tone? I'm sorry for the negativity, but it pisses me off when grand ideas and accomplishments are dismissed so offhandedly. Getting to Mars is not nearly ""nothing"", even compared to _anything_ that humans have ever done.",1351875399

That link expires after a certain amount of time, but in the mean time, clicking that link lets people access that Facebook account.<p>- A large number of services can be set up to automatically post any email received onto the web. One major category is disposable email services such as asdasd.ru. Any email to a throwaway account on asdasd.ru gets put up on the web. Here's an example Facebook recovery email that got turned into a web page: <a href=""http://asdasd.ru/read/414831"" rel=""nofollow"">http://asdasd.ru/read/414831</a><p>- Once these emails are just webpages, it's no surprise that search engines discover those URLs. Note that this is not a Google-specific issue. When I search on Bing for the query [site:facebook.com bcode n_m mid], the first result is also one of these urls that has an email address embedded in it. For a debunk of the misconception that this is related to the Google Toolbar or Chrome, see my post elsewhere in this discussion at <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4733276"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4733276</a><p>So: an email gets sent to someone.

4733568,comment,4723316,4725010,1,0,LukeHoersten,,,"My guess is that it depends on your business model.<p>(1) The risk to a TPPA model would be a fraudulent payment merchant signing up with your service buying from themselves with stolen cards. Charge-backs would occur here once the card owner discovered the card was stolen.<p>(2) The direct sale model risk would be selling and delivering a good or service and then the card holder (stolen or otherwise) charges-back to get the good/service for free.<p>In case (1) fraud detection would help detect the stolen card and mitigate the risk. In case (2), legitimate charge-backs from non-stolen cards are probably sometimes the bigger risk. I most likely didn't hit all the cases here but it certainly seems to be the case that PayPal or the like would not always help your business model with fraud prevention, supporting what callmeed said here.",1351875360

If it is the paradigm shifting kind, it is probably controversial, non intuitive and may not even make sense within the context of the status quo (e.g., Information Theory, Earth is round, Quantum Mechanics).  You really have to shove them down the people's throats to gain any support.  You don't worry about these getting stolen, because, most likely, you are getting ridiculed for stating them anyway.<p>Then there is the iterative kind of ideas (e.g., service which sends you an SMS when your website goes offline).  Marginally innovative, just the organic next step from where we are.  They are worth something, but probably much less than what people think.  Surely you can make a lot of money with these kind of ideas, but the chances are that many other people have come up with this ""idea"" as well, and it will be up to luck (and execution) to determine who makes the bank.",1351875224

4733528,comment,4732924,4733363,15,0,pufuwozu,,,"<i>Callbacks are different than gotos in that they are aren't even remotely close to gotos.</i><p>The analogy is that callbacks create non-linear control flow. Using a monadic syntax like in Roy, we can easily have callbacks without having them look non-linear:<p><pre><code>    let deferred = {\n      return: \x ->\n        let d = $.Deferred ()\n        d.resolve x\n        d.promise ()\n      bind: \x f -> x.pipe f\n    }\n\n    let v = do deferred\n      hello <- $.ajax 'examples/helloworld.roy'\n      alias <- $.ajax 'examples/alias.roy'\n      return (hello ++ alias)\n\n    v.done console.log\n</code></pre>\nWhich compiles into continuation passing:<p><pre><code>    var deferred = {\n        ""return"": function(x) {\n            var d = $.Deferred();\n            d.resolve(x);\n            return d.promise();\n        },\n        ""bind"": function(x, f) {\n            return x.pipe(f);\n        }\n    };\n    var v = (function(){\n        var __monad__ = deferred;\n        return __monad__.bind($.ajax('examples/helloworld.roy'), function(hello) {\n            return __monad__.bind($.ajax('examples/alias.roy'), function(alias) {\n                return __monad__.return((hello + alias));\n            });\n        });\n    })();\n    v.done(console.log);\n</code></pre>\nAnyway, continuations (with call/cc) are definitely a controlled form of goto. Take a look at an example from Paul Graham:<p><a href=""http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/cint.lisp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/cint.lisp</a><p><pre><code>    ((call/cc\n      (lambda (goto)\n        (letrec ((start\n                  (lambda ()\n                    (print ""start"")\n                    (goto next)))\n                 (froz\n                  (lambda ()\n                    (print ""froz"")\n                    (goto last)))\n                 (next\n                  (lambda ()\n                    (print ""next"")\n                    (goto froz)))\n                 (last\n                  (lambda ()\n                    (print ""last"")\n                    (+ 3 4))))\n          start))))</code></pre>",1351874989

(Disclaimer: I'm the community manager for 2600hz).<p>I've always thought Twilio was trying to get acquired (their deals with AT&T and Microsoft seemed to imply a conversation was happening in this regard at the very least) but for a valuation north of $1B. My personal feeling is that you can't get a $1B valuation without Mobile and Twilio doesn't really do mobile in the same way 2600hz doesn't really do mobile (at least not yet).<p>The walled Garden that is Carrier-land prevents native dialing (dialing through the handset dialer instead of a native app/web app/plugin). Becoming an MVNO is super risky, but I was really encouraged by Twilio's announcement with AT&T and even more so by Voxeo's announcement with Deutsche.<p>This is a big world and the clear winner of the voice API war will be crowned in the mid 20-teen's not now. If your argument is that Twilio will burn out before their acquired, my reply is: Maybe. That's the risk they took, and it's similar to the risk Square took (see this leaked chart: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/b1Sm9.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/b1Sm9.png</a>).<p>I admire Twilio because they're the best developer evangelism team I've ever seen. Yes they spend a ton on marketing and they might be the Groupon of Voice APIs, but the fact is that they're doing it, and if they get acquired all of the Voice API companies will benefit from their success.<p>In short, Twilio doing well actually benefits Voxeo and so I don't understand the worst girlfriend analogy. I'm by no means in love with Twilio, but you have to admire them for what they do: they're hands-down the best evangelists for any platform out there. Their developer engagement is nothing short of awesome.<p>Cheers,<p>Joshua",1351874312

I'm tired of staring at ls listings of terabyte filesystems and trying to figure out what order of magnitude the numbers are.  And yes, I know about ls -lh.<p>I would like to see a universal format agreed on by everyone, so that numbers with separators (call them punctuated numbers) output by one program could be used as input for another, as is often done in Unix pipelines.<p>The languages that I know of that have punctuated numbers all use underscores.  However, having thought about it a lot, I don't think this is a good choice.  First, the underscore is often used, as in C, as an additional character in identifiers, but the semantics are different.  An underscore in an identifier is significant, in a number it is not:<p>1_234_567 == 1234567, but<p>my_long_identifier != mylongidentifier<p>Also, the underscore is too ""big"".  In a fixed width font, this is irrelevant, but in a variable width font, I think it makes numbers look ugly.  The separator should be narrow. In some locales, the apostrophe is used:<p>1'234'567<p>I like the thinner character.  I have at least one calculator that uses this convention in the display.  Alas, this is probably unworkable in computers, since the apostrophe is used commonly for quoting. One option that might work is the back quote:<p>1`234`567<p>The back quote isn't used as much as the apostrophe, but it still might cause problems. On US keyboards, it's conveniently located right next to the 1.<p>Finally, I'd like to see both period and comma accepted as the decimal separator<p>1`234`567.89 == 1`234`567,89<p>but there are some obvious problems with that.<p>My bottom line is that, before C++, or any other language, adds underscores as thousands separators because that's what everyone else did, we should think more deeply about what's needed in a universal format for punctuated numbers.",1351874099

War has long been a concern of the appropriation of wealth and power and the destructiveness varies. Sometimes a city was sacked with all its men killed and women taken as property. Sometimes a city would be left largely intact but held under a different banner. Sometimes cities or countries are blockaded and sieged in order to starve them into submission. Then there are sneakier and more covert operations intended to destabilize from within.<p>Creativity, ingenuity and perseverance can provide success in either war and business, but it's never a guarantee. Consider Edwin Howard Armstrong, who experienced the destruction of his life after he invented FM radio.<p>Those who wage wars are not necessarily those who actually fight in them.

Even the Surface RT is smaller (.54 inches smaller to be exact) in the relevant dimension (the dimension that has to be spanned by thumb and middle finger) despite its screen having 1.166 times as much area as the iPad's. (This is possible since the Surface RT has an 16:9 aspect ratio versus the 4:3 aspect ratio of the iPad).<p>ADDED. Most heavy users of computers will of course want at least one device that meets that constraint (namely, being able to be picked up and held comfortably with one hand) e.g., a smartphone or a 7"" tablet or a 7.7"" tablet (like the Samsung Galaxy 7.7 or the Toshiba Excite 7 -- the only 2 shipping tablets with AMOLED btw) or (if they have big hands) a 7.9"" 4:3 tablet (the iPad mini).  I predict that in the years to come many of them who want a second, bigger mobile device will prefer a device with a 11.6"" screen (like the small Macbook Air or one of the many Windows 8 tablets with an Atom or Intel Core processor) or a 13.3"" screen (like a lot of popular clamshells or the announced-but-not-yet-available Android-ARM-powered Toshiba Excite 13 tablet) over an Asus Transformer (with their 10.1"" screens) or an iPad (with their 9.7"" screens).",1351873504

None really jump out over others to me and I'm not sure the overall benefits of taking 'Graphics' over 'Compilers' or if I'd be stupid to not take both.<p>So, for others that were in this situation or a similar situation in choosing a career or came to a fork in your education:<p>How did you pick your focus in Computer Science?<p>More about me if interested: \nI started getting interested in Computer Science my senior year of H.S. (~3 years ago) through a Micro-computer Projects elective and my freshman year of College I decided to go Computer Science and switch out if I didn't like it. Well... I ended up liking it a lot and have breezed through the CS classes thus far just out of pure interest of what I'm learning from various data structures to CPU design to Operating System design concepts. Distributed systems recently sparked my interest while learning about program concurrency. \nIt is absolutely intriguing and humbling to me how CS can impact any field it's applied to. On that note I also have an internship doing Java development/management of a Desktop (with GIS capabilities) and Android App for the USDA building software which takes several field conditions (soil, climate, nutrients, etc.) and evaluates the field to optimize nitrogen application to conserve the land and maximize crop yield. We are currently in 4 individual states, and also in Mexico, Brazil, Ecuador, and Puerto Rico.

Ideas being worthless is the lazy and easy way to explain to someone why they should get feedback on their idea.<p>The reality is ideas do have value.  We've got a great idea for a new product, and we're not telling anyone about it.  That's because our idea has value and we don't want anyone else to make it before we do.  Come back to us in a year or two and I'll happily explain our reasoning behind this.<p>If an idea is worthless it means it literally has zero value.  Value doesn't have to be a positive value, it can be negative as well.  Given 2 ideas, which of these would you rather develop:<p>- A mobile phone for elephants<p>- A service which sends you an SMS when your website goes offline<p>If both ideas have zero value, it doesn't matter which one you pick when you set out.  The reality is if you are going to set out and make mobile phones for elephants you are going to burn through your cash a lot quicker, and have a much lower chance of ever making money and succeeding (if you measure success through sustainability and profitability).<p>These two ideas are not equally worthless, therefore one has more value than another.  Two things with differing value cannot both be worthless unless they both have negative expected value.  Not all ideas have negative expected value and you easily build a case arguing that the SMS service idea has positive expected value.  ""All ideas are worthless"" is not true as all ideas have varying levels of negative/positive expected value.<p>Sharing your idea is usually the right thing to do, but it does come with some potential downsides.  Just because it's usually the right thing to do doesn't mean it's always the right thing to do.<p>Someone might steal/copy your idea.  It's probably a lower chance than most people estimate especially in the very early stages of startups.",1351873378

I think, as a social group, we're on a hinging point where women will be making equal footing in the tech industry, but haven't yet. Its coming.<p>Women are going to get disproportionate treatment during this transition in one or two different ways, and it depends on who they're interacting with. Should they land themselves alongside the stereotypical basement dweller they'll be cast aside and thought less of. They'll first need to prove themselves in an uphill battle. This will take great self confidence because there is <i>a lot</i> of misogyny still in the tech workplace. Too many tech gurus grew up being shunned socially and still have those emotional barriers preventing them from being rational and fair.<p>On the other swing of things though we have the opposite treatment: ""A girl? Oooo!"" I feel jealous sometimes of my female friends in the industry because of just how easy getting face to face for new jobs comes for them. I fight to keep myself in check because they're damn good professionals who deserve it but the thought remains: what sets them apart from me? Directly out of university I was competing locally with a lot of them for jobs and the treatment of women in the profession was quite apparent. I still see it a bit in my jobs now and its slightly disheartening.<p>Ultimately I think this problem will solve itself in time. Tech jobs aren't about the basement dweller anymore, they haven't been for years. The natural transition where everyone in the workforce has been part of it for the years where equal woman representation has been around and the awkward or preferential treatment is happening. We need vocal women to encourage more to join. Those classes in university will definitely be unsettling when 20 slobbering unkempt males are trying to wrestle their way to the only female group partner but to push through is going to be tough.",1351872644

The way that Chrome and Firefox actually do Safe Browsing is that they download an encrypted blob which allows the browser to do a lookup for dangerous urls on the client side--not by sending any urls to Google. I believe that if there's a match in the client-side encrypted table, only then does the browser send the now-suspect url to Google for checking.<p>Here's more info: <a href=""https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/</a> I believe the correct mental model of the Safe Browsing API in browsers is ""Download a hash table of believed-to-be-dangerous urls.

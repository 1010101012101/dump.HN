The thing to keep in mind with social networking is that it should not be the only draw of your website, but should be an added feature that makes the draw of your website more interactive.  Also, I just completed a site that includes social networking, and it was so much easier to integrate with the focus of the website, because I built it from scratch.",1186674144

40896,comment,40690,40765,0,0,whacked_new,,,"I agree with this, but after you have the framework to do this, I think, the more difficult part is how to present it.<p>Say you create a news site. You place the obvious largest sections in the obvious places, like the sorting options ""new"" and ""hot."" Now you want to accomodate all your user-created sections too. Where to put this?<p>You could create a cyclic box that just grabs particularly active user sections, but for oldtimers this would be inefficient. You could create a friends section kind of box that displays links to friend pages for logged in users, but that is potentially confusing and would compete with whatever top level links you initially have.<p>I believe it isn't so hard technically for reddit to open up user-created subreddits, but how to integrate it into the UI is what's hard. If you have a good solution, I'd like to hear, for the obvious reason. :)",1186673832

40889,comment,40816,40828,0,0,vlad,,,"Yes, I wrote 12 paragraphs that you must have seen, but I then edited down to one sentence.  It wasn't edited properly and I had no time to do it.  The point of it was basically the same thing you just said.<p>(I apologize for the lack of editing)
I don't know too much about them (I'm about to sign up right now) but I think one could start a similar service on a YCombinator investment.  If I were to do something like this, I'd create the web site and back-end for customers, support agents, and admins so customers could sign up and store account info, agents see questions and customer history and could reply via the web site when they're done, and admins could track quality of service.  You would have two or three founders answer the e-mails from other YCombinator companies to get a feel on the most-common requested tasks/services.<p>During a 1 month period after private launch where you track what people ask for, you would also code a system where only trusted agents would actually have access to the client's files, such as logging in to their yahoo! account, and then pass the data the user wanted to another support agent who specializes in generic, non-sensitive data who themselves could be outsourced eventually.<p>For example, when somebody asks for a Contact's map and directions in their Yahoo! account that they forgot to print out, an American would find that e-mail and send it to the 2nd level assistant who works for much less (on premises or outsourced) to finish the task.<p>After a few months, you'd identify higher-profit niches like those companies who use Google Office and cater to those companies via Google's API, setting higher prices and better/faster support.  For example, transcribing a document via phone into Google Writely, making it look nice, saving it and attaching it to an e-mail via Google Mail.  Eventually, you'd automate that aspect, too.<p>Another example might be listing a bunch of items on eBay every day from a spreadsheet with titles and descriptions pulled from similar items already on eBay.<p>Since the company, at root, would be a software company, it could come out with way more automation and plug-n-play support for latest API's than a regular staffing company.<p>The benefit to society is that any foreign person who wants to improve their life and have a computer job, and save customers time and money, will be able to be plugged into the system.<p>The fun of life is to improve, not to have.  Americans would outsource to Indians.  Indians could use this to outsource to others.  The buck might be passed down to those who use the $100 laptops in undeveloped countries eventually.  <p>Everybody learns, everybody improves, everybody focuses on productivity, not face-time.<p>Those for whom the dollar would make a big difference, proudly earn money, buy clean water, move to a city, etc, and start their own competitive businesses.  Those for whom saving 30 minutes is more important than a few dollars also benefit.  Everybody advances.<p>Instead of getting money from charities, those in 3rd world countries would learn math and computer skills by working for their money which goes a long way.  Giving somebody a buck doesn't teach them anything.  On the other hand, very few people in America don't have access to clean water, or things like that.  Instead of spending an hour researching a good $1,000 television to buy, people could save that time and pay $5-20 for the research.  All of a sudden, you just helped someone pay their electric and internet bill for the entire month, and all without the hassles of charities or needing to be rich to make a change in the world.<p>You'd get bought out by Google for 50 million dollars by March of next year.

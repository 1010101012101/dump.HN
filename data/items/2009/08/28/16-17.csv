This is not unlike what happens on reddit.com/r/programming, where an opportunity to sneer at Java is never missed, and every kind soul you encounter will gladly regale you with tales of the imaginary programs they claim to have written in Haskell or Lisp.<p>Perl, that miserable little unwanted orphan of a language, has real anonymous, first-class functions complete with closures.

Because its Benevolent Dictator for Life decreed that functional programming--even in the greatly-diluted form in which one finds it in mainstream languages--is bad and ""unpythonic""--heretical, essentially.

If serious cyclists want more people to get on bikes, they need to put some effort into making cycling more welcoming to newbies.<p>I live in San Francisco, and about a month ago I decided to buy a bike, the first time I'd bought a bicycle. I know how to ride a bike, but I am in all other ways a noob -- I've never owned a bike with gears (the last time I had a bike I was 12), know nothing about road bikes vs. mountain bikes vs. hybrids, etc.. Surely, in a city as self-consciously eco-friendly as San Francisco, I could find a bike store full of earnest, well-meaning hippies to point me in the right direction for planet-saving happiness, preferably on a budget?<p>No such luck. I walked into store after store to be greeted with barely-disguised contempt as I explained I had no idea what I wanted, just ""a bike to ride around on"", which turned into sneers of disgust when I said that I wanted to spend less than $500 on it.<p>Even co-workers who bike were of little help. One described buying a bike for less than $500 as ""like buying a netbook"". I countered that a netbook was a great analogy, as I wasn't going to be commuting on the bike, just riding it every so often, the cycling of equivalent of ""just checking my email"".<p>Eventually I got my bike (at Valencia Cyclery) and I'm enjoying it very much, but it's easy to see how people can be put off.

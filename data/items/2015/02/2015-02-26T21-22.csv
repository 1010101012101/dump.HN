This lets me iterate very very quickly over various solutions if needed without much concern about pretty code, even if it is a simple api call, parse json, display something in the view. When I have that working, I refactor, sometimes I rewrite, I make the UI nice, I write tests, etc.<p>In an interview, I believe you either want to see if the person can code/create and algorithm or you want to see his thought process on solving problems. If the latter, you don&#x27;t need a whiteboard and a conversation with someone will work as well. If the first, I would do as I mentioned in the previous post. The O(n!) question for me wouldn&#x27;t be important. I would probably reply &quot;Yes, I know, let me just finish this part&quot;... &quot;Back to the O(n!), you are right/wrong, but seems to work this way, what we can do is change that for loop into a something/something reducing it to O(2n). And rewrite that part of the code.<p>When I was interviewing people, after a quick phone screening, we would ask someone to come over, we had a quick chat with them (30 minutes maximum) and then had 2 quick exercises for them to do. 1) given a simple piece of code (200 lines or so) we would ask them to refactor it, based on some parameters like future extensibility, not being linked to some implementation, etc. Second one was a written spec, with 3-4 unit test written that would verify the spec, and we would ask for them to write the implementations (max. time 3h, good candidates finished it in 30-45minutes, bad ones couldn&#x27;t finish it in time). With those two questions we were quite easily &#x27;judge&#x27; the competence of the candidate. The ones that did very good would go home with job offers (or would have one when they got home), bad ones were rejected, and intermediate ones, depending on team feedback would be invited back to discuss the code so we could make up our minds.<p>ps: I actually wrote the exercises and everyone already at the company did them as well and passed.",1424987867

Bayesians would reply that if they thought the prior might be poor then they would simply consider multiple different priors, but it&#x27;s not clear how this would improve things much over the frequentist approach that simply assumes that the prior is unknown.<p><i>> So when you don&#x27;t know the prior and you observe a low p-value on something, isn&#x27;t that just &quot;preliminary research&quot; that needs to be further confirmed with other methods or at least the same test but using other data?</i><p>Yes, when you observe a p-value with low significance it should definitely indicate to you that more testing is necessary, either by using different testing methods, gathering new samples, or even just increasing the original sample size if that&#x27;s possible. What I was trying to suggest in my last paragraph was that this should be the case even when we have highly significant p-values, because even significant p-values are not decisive. So even when we have &quot;confirmatory research&quot; that is highly statistically significant, we should still do all of the things that we would do when we have a p-value with low significance. It is sometimes the case that this subsequent research will overturn even very highly statistically significant results (though often this is unfortunately because mistakes in the original statistical methodology are uncovered).",1424987324

&quot;This  paper  examines  the  economic  impact  of  local  public  initiatives  to  build  and  operate  broadband  internet  infrastructure.  I  find  that  local  efforts  produce  small  economic  benefits,  but  they  cause  a  notable  increase  in  the  size  of  local  government.  Using  difference-in-differences estimation  on  panel  data  consisting  of  23  years  of  observations  from  core  based  statistical  areas in  the  contiguous  United  States,  I  find  that  publicly  supported  broadband  networks  lead  to  over  3  percent  more  business  establishments,  while  reducing  worker  income  by  1.3  percent,  all  else being  equal.  The  networks  have  no  discernible  effect  on  private  sector  employment,  but  they increase  local  government  employment  by  around  6  percent.<p>In  light  of  the  financial  difficulties  some  public  networks  experience  and  the  limited  economic benefits  they  offer,  public  involvement  is  more wisely directed  toward  fostering  private  sector innovation  as  opposed  to  maintaining  a  more  active role.  Local  initiatives  that  maintain  an active  role  for  local  government  can  lead  to  a misallocation  of  resources  if  they  ignore  market signals  and  cause  taxpayers  to  bear  the  uncertainty of  the  broadband  market  as  opposed  to private  shareholders.&quot;",1424986965

We can show example of tragedies involving unmanaged shared common resources.<p>Railways and the ICC are a very similar analogy but we can reason about all sorts of other precedent.

3. In the FCC filings section, you can see that the NPRM was filed May 2014. This sets the comment period to July 2014, and the comment reply period to September 2014. 
4. There is an order issued in July 2014 that denies extension of the comment period.
5. I conclude that we are in fact, on step #7, and are just waiting on the Report and Order to be filed, at which time the regulations are enacted.
6. Furthermore, Wheeler&#x27;s statement talks about an &#x27;Order&#x27;.

the teacher knows theta-star upfront and doesn’t need to explore.</i><p>Based on this quote from page 1 and Wikipedia for &quot;active learning&quot; [1], I see the distinction in my examples as this:<p>1. In machine teaching, the teacher chooses the new observations to be presented. In active learning, the learner chooses new observations to be labeled.
2. In machine teaching, the availability of observations in general is controlled. In active learning, observations may be available but unlabeled, as in a cross-validation set.

I think the Socratic dialogue format was an excellent choice as it makes it very easy to follow.<p>The big problem with machine teaching in many practical applications is what the paper refers to as the &quot;glaring flaw&quot;, and that is that you often don&#x27;t know what the learning algorithm might look like (e.g. in the provided nefarious example of trying to defeat a spam filter). In fact, the learning algorithm could be arbitrarily complex.<p>In the case where you do know the learning algorithm exactly (e.g. the learner is a robot where you have its precise specifications), the problem is the deterministic optimization problem described in this paper. But when the learning algorithm is unknown, the problem becomes stochastic, and then you&#x27;re facing all of the traditional problems with optimization in a probabilistic space (e.g. overfitting, robustness problems, etc). That&#x27;s not to say that it&#x27;s strictly <i>impossible</i> to apply machine teaching approaches in such a case, it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s a much more difficult problem to find a somewhat optimal training set.",1424986103

The platform is built on top of Amazon Web Services and utilizes Docker to provide users with a sysops-free way to manage complex database and application architectures.<p>Aptible’s mission is to help our customers work safely with the most meaningful, sensitive data in highly regulated industries. To do this, we build devops tools that streamline information security compliance for web and mobile applications. We currently focus primarily in healthcare, on HIPAA compliance.<p>We are backed by the best investors in tech, including Y Combinator (S14), Rock Health, Maverick and Lux Capital.<p>YOU ARE A GOOD FIT IF:<p>- You have extensive experience with AWS<p>- You are excited to work with Docker<p>- You have a professional background related to designing backend software systems<p>- You communicate well and work effectively with others<p>- You are comfortable with high degrees of freedom and responsibility<p>WHY WORK WITH US?<p>- <i>Engineering First:</i> Aptible is a tech company from the ground up. It’s founded by engineers, the team is predominantly engineers, and our users are all engineers. Your coworkers and customers will be some of the best in the world at what they do.<p>- <i>Independence & Trust:</i> Over time, you will be expected to function independently with minimal process overhead for significant portions of your work. This reinforces a high degree of mutual trust within our team.<p>- <i>Our Business Model:</i> We make money by charging our customers a monthly fee for software and services. This allows us to make decisions for the long term. We aren’t the type of startup where we give away everything for free in hopes that once we collect 100 PB of data we can build an AI to replace your doctor or sell pharma ads.<p>- <i>Our Customers:</i> We help the best companies in digital health solve their hardest engineering and regulatory problems. We involve them in our product development process and have a weekly support rotation in which the whole team participates. It’s a great way to learn firsthand the strongest and weakest points in the product.<p>- <i>Introspection:</i> Most of us have worked at a half-dozen companies or more. We’ve lived through best and worst practices in how to run teams. We value regular reflection on process (i.e., retrospectives) with constant small course corrections instead of bulk overhauls when things get really bad. We strive to make expectations clear and give regular, actionable feedback.<p>- <i>Professional Development:</i> In building our deployment platform, you’ll be solving new, hard problems at the bleeding edge of container coordination. If you believe that containers are the new paradigm, your work at Aptible will prepare you tremendously for the future. By helping our customers solve issues with their own open-source-based applications, you’ll quickly become an expert in many open-source frameworks and libraries.<p>- <i>OSS:</i> We believe in active participation in the open-source community on which we’re built. The majority of our GitHub repos are public. You will have the opportunity to create, maintain, and contribute to some of the most interesting projects in open-source.<p>- <i>Flexibility:</i> We are based in Brooklyn but our team is distributed across the country. As a senior engineer, you’ll have the freedom to work on your own schedule, from wherever you like. You’re always more than welcome at headquarters, and we will fly you in periodically for all-hands weeks.<p>- <i>Upside:</i> As an early employee, you’ll receive both competitive salary and meaningful equity in a company that’s growing fast. We think startups should give employees more stock, be more transparent about what percentage of the company that stock represents, and discuss what happens to that stock in various outcomes.<p>OTHER BENEFITS<p>- Full medical, dental and vision coverage — 100% of premiums for employees, 80% for dependent medical premiums, and 100% for dependent dental and vision premiums.<p>- Mandatory minimum vacation each year. Too often at startups, “unlimited vacation” means “no vacation.” We will force you to take time off. Our CEO will suspend your email and GitHub access if you don’t do it.<p>- Relocation assistance, if you want to move to NYC.<p>- Whatever computing setup you want.<p>Apply at https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/e14de4f6-9fb1-426d-8003-82b91f72d1f9/apply?lever-source=HackerNews",1424984582

Lately I&#x27;ve been wondering if people think or animals actually &quot;think&quot;. Perhaps everything we do extends from some kind of simple instinct in the case of insects to an extremely advanced form of instinct humans, primates, corvids, etc.",1424984449

No longer is the discussion of the subject at hand but the persons involved. This allows all sorts of toxic labels to be branded about, racist, bigot, for the rich, elitist, and more. They don&#x27;t want to debate facts, the fastest way to avoid facts is to brand the other side with a label associated with hate and/or stupidity.<p>I just want to know, what takes so many pages as to describe these rule changes? Why was it so important to pass changes without public review? What part of transparency don&#x27;t people get?",1424984436

How is this different from having sponsored results in the search results on Google? I feel this is great for a number of reasons:<p>1. This allows apps which are new to not just rely on something unreliable as App store optimization to get downloads.
2. This will force app developers to think about monetization more seriously and possibly even get rid of free apps culture.
3. You can get users at the point of their query. Facebook gets you passive users. For example on FB you might need to reach 100 people to find one person who has a problem solved by your app, but using this you can find the exact people looking for apps which solve the problem your app is about.
4. The argument about Zynga and King owning the sponsored are false. It is like saying Microsoft, Twitter and Facebook are going to own the search results on Google.
5. Improvement in organic search doesn&#x27;t need to happen without starting sponsored results.",1424984410

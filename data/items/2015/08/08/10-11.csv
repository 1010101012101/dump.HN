This assumption was based on what is known as the &quot;False Consensus&quot; effect.<p>I graduated from the university (undergrad) in 2003 with a bachelors degree in computer science.  I joined a company that was prestigious at that time.  Soon after joining, I felt very disappointed in my career choice as all around me were teams that were outsourcing major roles to TCS and InfoSys consultants.  Adding insult to injury, in order to receive their full severance packages, the full time employees were required to stay on long enough to train their low-cost replacement.  Seeing this, I felt &quot;awful&quot; about the IT career path.<p>If I could go back, I wish I knew that IT wasn&#x27;t as easily commoditized as the managers around me assumed it was.  Further, I wish I knew that this company was not representative of a broader trend across the entire American economy.  Knowing this, I think I would have doubled down on acquiring more tech skills and spent less time diversifying my skillset into business domains requiring tech.<p>On the other hand, a positive outcome of this early career experience is that how I reacted to that culture made me who I am today.

Is there a reference you can point me to?  In particular, if I have<p><pre><code>    ^x {\n        ...\n        cont c\n        ...\n    }\n\n    c() {\n        ...\n        pause(^x = foo)\n        ...\n    }\n</code></pre>\nthen when &#x27;pause&#x27; is run control flow jumps back to the cont.  How do I then resume execution of &#x27;c&#x27;?  It seems like I have to somehow encounter that &#x27;cont c&#x27; line again either in a loop or by reinvocation of an enclosing function.  But can there be two calls to &#x27;cont c&#x27;?<p><pre><code>    ^x {\n        ...\n        cont c\n        ...\n        cont c\n        ...\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAnd the second one returns control to the thread that &#x27;paused&#x27; when called from the first?  If so, how do I start an entirely new thread?<p>This was all a bit confusing, so if you can point me to a reference I would be grateful.

10026830,comment,10017613,10021214,0,0,tome,,,"OK, I think there&#x27;s a fundamental misunderstanding at play here, of what purity, effects and monads are.<p>Koka&#x27;s effects system <i>is</i> monadic!  Crazy huh?  Well look:<p><pre><code>    function main()\n    {\n      bind(foo, bar)\n    }\n    \n    function foo()\n    {\n      println(&quot;Returning 3&quot;)\n      return 3\n    }\n    \n    function bar(x)\n    {\n      println(&quot;Adding 1 to my argument and printing&quot;)\n      y = x + 1\n      println(y)\n    }\n    \n    function bind(x : () -> e a, f : a -> e b) : e b\n    {\n      y = x()\n      return f(y)\n    }\n    \n    function return_(x)\n    {\n      return x\n    }\n</code></pre>\nI can define return and bind generically over effects <i>e</i> just like in Haskell!<p>Checked exceptions in Java are also monadic!  Well, in a sense but I don&#x27;t know enough about Java to write down the types correctly.  Maybe the types can&#x27;t even be written, but it doesn&#x27;t stop the <i>nature</i> of checked exceptions being monadic.  Specifically, if I have<p><pre><code>    A method1()  throws Exception1, Exception2, ...\n    B method2(A) throws Exception1, Exception2, ...\n</code></pre>\nthen combining them thusly<p><pre><code>    method2(method1())\n</code></pre>\nis <i>exactly</i> binding in a monad.  It&#x27;s not a monad defined as a specific datastructure in your language, but it <i>is</i> a monadic operation.  It&#x27;s pretty much the same monadic operation as the bind in the hypothetical &quot;universal monad&quot;[2] you propose in your talk.<p>The reason effects are monadic is that if you have a computation C1 that does effects of type E and that returns a value of type A, and an computation C2 that does effects of type E and that takes a value of type A as argument and returns a value of type B, then you can combine them to form a function that does effects of type E and returns a value of type B.  This is the bind of a monad!<p>Different languages may have different levels of support for the syntax of effects/monads at the type or value level, for programming generically with effects/monads, and for defining your own and combining them, but the fact remains that effects are monadic.<p>The misunderstanding is that you seem to think a monad is a value <i>along with some extra stuff</i>.  In particular, you think that in a pure language a value of type IO is a value <i>along with some extra stuff</i>.  This is wrong!  It&#x27;s understandable that you came to this conclusion given the thousand misleading monad tutorials that say &quot;a monad is a value in a context&quot; or &quot;when you use IO you are building up a computation for an impure runtime to run&quot;.  But this is wrong!<p>Haskell is not a &quot;pure language&quot;.  &quot;Pure language&quot; is a not a well-defined concept.  It&#x27;s simply a neat slogan to summarize one of Haskell&#x27;s characteristics without getting technical.  What is pure in Haskell is let bindings and function application.  That&#x27;s it.  (In fact I would classify Koka under the slogan &quot;pure language&quot; since you can tell from its type whether a function performs any effects.)<p>IO in Haskell is <i>exactly</i> an effect type like &#x27;console&#x27; in Koka.  It is monadic in Haskell, like in Koka.  In Haskell it&#x27;s slightly more awkward because let bindings and function application are pure so you are forced to use monad combinators (or do notation) to combine them, but this is just a syntactic difference not one of any substance[1].  Koka has better support for combining effects through essentially the &quot;universal monad&quot;[2] you mentioned in your talk.<p>In the implementation of Haskell[3] a function of type &#x27;a -> IO b&#x27; is <i>exactly</i> the same as a function of type &#x27;a -> b&#x27;[4].  It isn&#x27;t a function &quot;which returns an &#x27;IO b&#x27; which is an instruction to an impure runtime to run some effectful code&quot;.  It isn&#x27;t &quot;a &#x27;b&#x27; in a context&quot;.  It isn&#x27;t &quot;a &#x27;b&#x27; with some other stuff&quot;.  Haskell does not &quot;trigger effects in the runtime by returning monadic values&quot;.  Haskell <i>has</i> effects!  I&#x27;ll reiterate because this is important.  A function of type &#x27;a -> IO b&#x27; is <i>exactly</i> a function &#x27;a -> b&#x27;.  It&#x27;s just been tagged with an effect type called &#x27;IO&#x27;.  We combine these effect types with monadic combinators <i>because the nature of effects in monadic</i>, not for any other reason.<p>Some other monads (Either, Maybe, State) are more like what you are thinking of.  But they&#x27;re different monads!  They don&#x27;t somehow subsume the entire nature of monads.  Monads, like effect types, can simply be used for tracking effects.  Monads will always be part of effect systems.<p>[1] I am very happy to consider syntactic improvements that make effects more easy to work<p>[2] I disagree that the &quot;universal monad&quot; is not typeable in Haskell.  At least some version of a &quot;universal monad&quot; is typeable.  It may look a bit awkward though.<p>[3] At least in GHC.  Other implementations are free to do what they want.<p>[4] Actually slightly augmented with a trick to stop the optimizer breaking, but that&#x27;s not of substance.",1439028085

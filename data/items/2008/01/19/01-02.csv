If you think that's bloated, I hope you don't visit sites that contain images.<p>Do you understand what I mean about the distinction between source and object code?  Saying that html ought to be elegant implies that you don't.  As a rule, the more elegant the language, the less elegant its object code is, because the further removed its concepts are from the primitive concepts used by a compiler.",1200707007

I certainly hope it doesn't come to that.<p>I've always thought that news sites like digg would become the eqivalent of the Web OS, the gateway to the internet. I can see Bacebook filling that space easily though, now that I think about it. The difference there is that digg is pointing users to other places on the internet, while facebook in that case actually BECOMES the internet for those people.<p>It'll certainly be interesting to see how it all pans out in 10 years.",1200706142

I'd like to easily design a webpage that renders fine on 90% of my user's screens.  I'd bet 90% of my users will be using personal computers, and use a resolution between 800x600 and 1920x1200.

I'd love to introduce you to the <i>m.mypage.com</i> section of my site.<p>Something like ""Center a child relative to a parent"" isn't hard to do (we do it at work for our video game GUI), and it really seems like a few architecture astronauts got ahold of the CSS standards to cause these API usability problems.<p>Also, arguments like ""You can't do that simple thing because.."" are starting to sound like the arguments C++ pundits use to justify its monstrous complexity compared to C.",1200704976

Sure, but the best approach of all is to write in neither, and instead have a program generate it.  Then it doesn't matter which you use.<p>Complaining that the html source of a software-generated site is ugly is like complaining that the code generated by the compiler of a high level language is ugly.  <i>Of course</i> it's ugly; that's the whole point of high level languages.",1200704648

The latter problem is probably the reason so many hackers are ""missing the boat.""<p>But look at facebook right now; its arguably worse with the apps. Companies like Slide hijack your news feed and spam your friends. That's uncool and it puts me off.<p>A lot of those spamming tactics are how apps get so much exposure, but I don't see Facebook allowing that kind of stuff for very much longer.<p>My point is, relying on Facebook as your provider is pretty risky.

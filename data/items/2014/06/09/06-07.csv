7867303,comment,7866304,7866304,1,0,natural219,,,"Reading the comments, I can&#x27;t help but feel people are being overly negative about this project.  Math education is a huge, sprawling, decades-long endeavor.  It involves so many disciplines and moving parts and areas of pedagogy.  Math education for college graduates is an entirely different thing than establishing basic numerical concepts in early minds and teaching kids to be confident manipulating symbols using mathematical rules to achieve tangible goals.  I think it&#x27;s an incredibly fruitful idea to take these simple math concepts and put them in an immersive 3D environment, and this project hits the nail on the head in regards to how we get there.<p>There are two main obstacles to achieving learning:  Engagement, and efficiency.  A lot of efficient ways of teaching end up not being engaging, and a lot of engaging ways of teaching end up not being very efficient.<p>I strongly believe that math education of the future will be one to tie these together in an important way, and I think Mathbreakers is the best attempt I&#x27;ve seen so far to bridge that gap in a practical, accessible way for youngsters.  They have derived all level design and concepts from working directly with teachers and playtesting on students in real classrooms.  They have achieved tangible results so far, after only a year of work.  I can&#x27;t imagine where they will be one year from now.<p>Kudos to the Mathbreakers team, I think this is one of the coolest projects to come out of Kickstarter I&#x27;ve seen in a while.",1402295494

7867285,comment,7866583,7866583,1,0,richardofyork,,,"I am the author, and I will try to address some of the comments:<p>1. First, if you buy and read the book, your writing will definitely improve. You will write better than you ever have. I am confident you will. Those tiny grammar books on amazon.com wouldn&#x27;t help much because many don&#x27;t cover the crucial topics for writing well. I read nearly all of them.<p>2. Language is instinctual, so arguing about grammatical rules is pointless. Take this passage from my book: &quot;I agree with Steven Pinker, as he describes in his book &quot;The Language Instinct,&quot; that humans have an instinct to learn and use language, and some nonstandard grammars and dialects perceived to be unsophisticated and ungrammatical (Appalachian English Vernacular and Black English Vernacular, for example) do, in fact, follow sophisticated grammatical rules.<p>I will not hurl even a pebble of criticism to anyone who uses English grammar to his or her own inclination. Instead, this book helps people who want to improve their Standard American English and Standard British English grammar. By “standard,” I mean the form used in academia, mainstream businesses and books, and formal and informal writing aimed at the general public or educated readers.<p>3. For the first bullet, I combined two similar bullets into one, hence the possible oddity. I constructed it for brevity, not for eloquence. No need to niggle over a bullet; it&#x27;s a peccadillo. Incidentally, I wrote an entire chapter on how to write eloquent prose.<p>4. Ztratar, I presume you would agree that books are not useless. While anyone can probably learn anything online, books are still usually more organized and better researched than disparate articles and blog posts spread across hundreds of websites. In fact, to my knowledge, about half of the content in my book cannot be found online. I have devised some new grammatical constructions and techniques for writing skillfully.<p>5. Icambron, you should definitely read my book. You will learn a lot. For example, you will learn that all those things you pointed out are actually grammar myths (aka superstitions). I have an entire section on myths that many people believe are legitimate rules of grammar. Many such myths abound even in schools, including college. You should read the following article, a section from my book; you may find some of the cool sentence constructions quite different from the prosaic and formulaic constructions taught in schools:\n<a href=""https://grammarandwritingforcreators.com/Creative_Powerful_Ways_to_Start_Sentences.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://grammarandwritingforcreators.com/Creative_Powerful_W...</a><p>5. Seanmcdirmid, I wrote an entire section on the rhythm and euphony of sentences, another topic rarely found in grammar books. You can read this new figure of speech that I have devised (unrelated to rhythm, but all the examples employ rhythm):\n<a href=""https://grammarandwritingforcreators.com/Conceal_Reveal_Article_FINAL.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://grammarandwritingforcreators.com/Conceal_Reveal_Arti...</a>",1402294967

That&#x27;s why library ecosystems like that of Python, Ruby, and Node.js have grown large in recent years.<p>Thats where the author missed an important point. None of those library archives have the culture of PAUSE+CPAN to constrain a minimal code quality when it comes to configuration, documentation, regression test and installation. This minimal code quality is constrained by CPAN testers, when a module hits PAUSE, before the module is seen by the unwashed masses who access CPAN.<p>I&#x27;ve seen many library archives of other languages, but they are all full of junk, undocumented junk, untested junk, and junk that does not configure or install everywhere. The worst example was the LuaRocks system. The quality of the libraries in the Rocks archive had been so bad, that the church decided to remove the module keyword from Lua language, to get rid of this junk. But the code I see for Ruby/Rails, NPM/Node, or PyPy/Python is junk compared to even those Perl modules, that barely managed to convince CPAN testers.<p>You not only need the absolute numbers, but important you need a core group starting the ecosystem who constrain a coding culture.

It's an obvious fact of human nature. One way to know this is by self-observation. That may seem oxymoronic (how can I observe something I am denying?) but with a bit of honesty it works well.<p>One tell-tale sign is when the emotional charge around something is incommensurate with the reason someone is giving.

My suggestions:<p>1) The video was helpful and I would out it right under the ""Try it for free"" tab<p>2) In terms or pricing strategy, I like the idea of giving away one class for free and then adopt a per class pricing at around $30. I am sure there would be some teachers out there who would just use their one class slot for all classes but then you will always find 10% of your customers getting more than what they paid for. Lets worry about the remaining 90%<p>3) Make sure you keep track of what school are these teachers from.

As I said in my email to you some time ago, I had the idea for Eduset having never even heard of Edmodo, and only discovered Edmodo about halfway through the process of building Eduset. While I was certainly stunned at how similar the ideas were, I decided that the classroom microblogging space was big enough for more than one player, so I continued work.<p>Further, for the record, the inspiration for Eduset came from Pownce. When I first tried the Pownce closed beta, I realized that its model would apply perfectly to the classroom setting.<p>Edit: Also, note that Edmodo is planning to add paid features this year (<a href=""http://www.edmodo.com/blog/2009/06/07/thank-you-for-a-successful-year/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edmodo.com/blog/2009/06/07/thank-you-for-a-succes...</a>)<p>Edit 2: I'd like to emphasize again that I sent Jeff a long and detailed email about this exactly 3 weeks ago, containing everything I've said here and more. He confirmed to me that he received the email, but has yet to reply. For him to then take the debate public here, without bothering to talk to me personally, is unnecessary and absurd.",1253681664
838640,story,,,31,30,startupguy73,"Ask HN: I think my startup is going to fail, what should I do?",,"Dear Hacker News:<p>About six months ago, me and two of my friends (we work at the same company) decided to go and start a startup. Since we didn't have funding, we figured we'd keep our day jobs, build the website, get a few users, and then quit and work on the company full time. The initial plan was for me to do the programming/technical stuff, one of my friends to handle getting funding and the other to handle marketing/getting users.<p>I've built a pretty decent site (in my humble opinion), but I think my friends want to abandon the project. They've floated the idea (several times) of just scrapping all my current code and starting over, they don't propose new features anymore, they haven't gotten around to getting the paperwork to form the company since they said they would (in June) and they say now they might never do it, etc., etc.<p>I only put a few months of full-time equivalent work into the company, so it's not the end of the world if it fails, but this sort of thing seems to keep happening to me. When I was in college, I did some research with a professor and he never got around to helping me with the write-up and publishing. I wrote a long article for a magazine last year, sent it in to the editor, they said it was very nice and then ignored it. I did part an earlier web application four years ago, but my co-workers never launched it. How can I avoid this sort of failure?",1253681634

838615,comment,838136,838323,0,0,DaniFong,,,"I think there's a pretty good case out there for the fact that sexism hurts men as well as women. Sometimes profoundly. I can only imagine how devastating it would be to want to devote one's life to caring for, raising, and teaching children, while trying to deal with suspicions of, as others have suggested here, intending to sexually abuse!<p>I think there's a lot of work to be done if we want a better culture than that.<p>I have a question for readers out there: are there any specific instances in which gender stereotypes impeded or prevented or dissuaded you from pursuing something you would have liked to that you'd like to discuss? Sexism isn't one sided.<p>Some posts to seed the discussion:<p>- iamelgringo on his experience nursing <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=333168"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=333168</a><p>- smoody on feeling isolated in an engineering culture in which women far outnumbered men <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=332894"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=332894</a><p>- sanj making an analogy between a college experiences <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=332889"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=332889</a><p>To be honest, some of the worst experiences with sexism I have nowadays revolve around the ludicrous extrapolations of the evolutionary psychology du jour that come up anytime a debate surfaces around gender equality on HN. The porn ridden CouchDB presentation didn't really rate for me (though I didn't attend) - it was the reaction afterwards that was more stressful. A single person can just be socially inept, but when it's clear how pervasive homebrew theories for why men are bred to prefer risk and have more variation in intelligence and aim for high status and pursue young women and are bred to be polygamous and on and on, it becomes much harder to forget, from day to day, that sexism is around me.<p>Occasionally I find voices being raised around some engineering issue. I feel like I need to yell to be heard - and being visibly upset doesn't do much to quell the intensity. In certain dark moments this has had me considering leaving engineering, though I doubt women have a monopoly on the sentiment.<p>To be honest I think a lot of the things that would have kept me from my career choice are behind me. I've heard people express surprise that I take on a technical role in my company, or that I founded it. Even around the liberal Berkeley I sometimes hear surprise, from strangers, that I of all people would have studied physics. There was a time when that would have impeded me more, but I avoided a lot of it dropping out of junior high - which seems to be the time when a lot of girls drop out of many stereotypically nerdy interests.<p>Sometimes the worst sexism experienced by women comes from women. The worst of it that I've experienced probably shouldn't go here, but some of it I've dealt with through HN. This is probably more annoying than anything else, but I had the privilege of reading Bonnie Ruberg write in ""5 Reasons Why I Want Digg For Girls"" say that a project I was working on (I started a company in the area, it's doing well) was interesting to her because ""only because they're the kind of things I know my male, Internet-loving friends could sit around and blab about for hours.""<p>One gauge for the degree of cultural influence on technical career choices is the nationality skew. Andreescu et. al. (<a href=""http://www.ams.org/notices/200810/fea-gallian.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/notices/200810/fea-gallian.pdf</a>) note that the Bulgarian, Russian, and USA IMO teams perform at roughly the same level, and their female team mates perform at a similar level as well. But the Bulgarian team has had 21 girls in its history, the Russian team 15, and the USA team only 3. This, they argue, demonstrates that the disparity cannot be due to country specific difficulties for girls in qualifying for the IMO - instead ""some countries routinely identify and nurture both boys and girls to become world class mathematical problem solvers; others, including the USA, only rarely identify girls of this caliber.""<p>There's also the issue of stereotype threat. As Diane Quinn writes (<a href=""http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0341/is_1_57/ai_75140961/pg_2/?tag=content;col1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0341/is_1_57/ai_75140...</a>) ""Stereotype threat occurs when a person is in a situation in which a negative stereotype about that person (or that person's group) could be applied to the person and used to judge the person's behavior."" Shih et. al. performed a study in which Asian American women wrote a math test. Before the test was taken, participants were asked to identify their race or sex. Those who were asked their race rather than their sex performed significantly better.",1253680559

They could have also acquired other top tier talent if there wasn't such an exodus during the initial bid by Microsoft.  I wonder what a group of 10-15 of smart product focused hackers+product guys from yc/hn would do to fix Yahoo! up.  hmm, feel free to email me thoughts, could make for an interesting potential blog post/theoretical situation.",1253679691

Men have wielded the power, at least in the workplace. While we'd all like to believe that the effects of that power disparity are now gone, it would be naive to think so, especially once we remember that the top executives at most large employers began their careers in a time when they could not imagine competing with women in the workplace.<p>You don't need to spend much time in a typical office to realize that women face challenges men do not when it comes to being taken seriously in technical fields. Don't believe me? Find your closest after-work bar and eavesdrop on the conversations around you. If you have a wife or daughter (assuming you're a man), would you want them to be the subjects of some of the conversations you're likely to hear?<p>Yes, there are fields in which men face special challenges (or at least the assumption that they're gay if they choose to go into those fields). However, the highest paying careers are in fields dominated by men.<p>I believe that computer programming is a skill that will dominate the professions more as the business world catches up with its potential. Nearly all business functions can be improved with the addition of automation and data analysis that programmers can provide. If some ability to program is not a future requirement for success in the business world, the ability to talk well with programmers and have a grasp of what it is they do will be. I also believe that programming is one of the best paths of upward mobility for people of a low socioeconomic background. If either of these beliefs are correct, the fact that women face greater challenges than men in entering this field is an injustice and should be corrected.",1253679156

838577,comment,836722,836966,0,0,michaelkeenan,,,"I've never tried pair programming so I don't have an opinion on it, but I do know of an interesting pair programming story about Richard Stallman. It's related by Sam Williams in chapter six of his book <i>Free As In Freedom: Richard Stallman's Crusade For Free Software</i>:<p>[Guy Steele] recalls a notable episode in the late 1970s when the two programmers banded together to write the editor's ""pretty print"" feature. Originally conceived by Steele, pretty print was another keystroke-triggered feature that reformatted Emacs' source code so that it was both more readable and took up less space, further bolstering the program's WYSIWIG qualities. The feature was strategic enough to attract Stallman's active interest, and it wasn't long before Steele wrote that he and Stallman were planning an improved version.<p>""We sat down one morning,"" recalls Steele. ""I was at the keyboard, and he was at my elbow,"" says Steele. ""He was perfectly willing to let me type, but he was also telling me what to type.<p>The programming session lasted 10 hours. Throughout that entire time, Steele says, neither he nor Stallman took a break or made any small talk. By the end of the session, they had managed to hack the pretty print source code to just under 100 lines. ""My fingers were on the keyboard the whole time,"" Steele recalls, ""but it felt like both of our ideas were flowing onto the screen. He told me what to type, and I typed it.""<p>The length of the session revealed itself when Steele finally left the AI Lab. Standing outside the building at 545 Tech Square, he was surprised to find himself surrounded by nighttime darkness. As a programmer, Steele was used to marathon coding sessions. Still, something about this session was different. Working with Stallman had forced Steele to block out all external stimuli and focus his entire mental energies on the task at hand. Looking back, Steele says he found the Stallman mind-meld both exhilarating and scary at the same time. ""My first thought afterward was: it was a great experience, very intense, and that I never wanted to do it again in my life.""<p><a href=""http://oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch06.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch06.html</a><p>Of course, that doesn't say anything about what Stallman or Steele could have produced that day working separately, but it is interesting to me that Stallman pair-programmed at least sometimes.",1253678598

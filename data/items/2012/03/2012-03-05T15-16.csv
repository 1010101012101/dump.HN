3666907,comment,3666564,3666793,8,0,tizoc,,,"In Django (and Python in general) you have a form abstraction that validates the user input and filters out unwanted fields, preventing problems like this. On Rails (and Ruby in general) they don't use such abstraction (I do myself, using an implementation of forms abstractions[1] very similar to what Django provides).<p>Instead they send the params dictionary (which contains url captures, POST and GET values) directly to the model instance, and expect the model to deal with it. The problem with this approach is that it gives too much responsability to the model. Other than forms not necessarily mapping directly to models, making this more complicated, it is also prone to security issues, like the one Github suffered. ActiveRecord (Rails ORM) allows you to whitelist and blacklist fields at the model level (which IMO is the wrong way to do this, Django got it right), but a lot of people don't do it.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/tizoc/bureaucrat"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tizoc/bureaucrat</a>",1330963045

Yes, mistakes do happen, but there's a very simple way to avoid the exploit that is postulated in this article.<p>The 'schematic' of what the public key update looks like from the original post:<p><pre><code>    class PublicKeyController < ApplicationController\n      before_filter :authorize_user\n      ...\n      def update\n        @current_key = PublicKey.find_by_id params[:key]['id']\n        @current_key.update_attributes(params[:key])\n      end\n    end\n</code></pre>\nThe correct way to code this is as follows:<p><pre><code>    class PublicKeyController < ApplicationController\n      before_filter :authorize_user\n      ...\n      def update\n        @current_key = current_user.public_keys.find params[:key]['id']\n        @current_key.update_attributes(params[:key])\n      end\n    end\n</code></pre>\nThis has two updates to it that protect against this exploit:<p>1. Rather than calling ""find_by_id"" on the PublicKey model, which searches all public keys, you call it on the current user's list of public keys.  This scopes the search down to the public keys that they own.  Thus, if you pass in the id of a key they do not own, it will not be found, leading us to:<p>2. Using ""find"" instead of ""find_by_id"" will trigger an ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound error (404) if the resource is not found.  Of course, find_by_id will just return nil in this instance, so the update_attributes part would still fail, but triggering a 404 is an easier, cleaner way of dealing with this, I think.<p>It's really very simple: you don't let people access stuff they don't own.<p>Now, this does not protect you against faked timestamps, or against privilege escalation by passing in a faked ""role"" parameter, and so on.  You still need to use attr_accessible to protect yourself from that stuff, but scoping resources down to the user who owns them is a simple technique that should be standard practice for applications with authentication.",1330961475

They certainly were justified in thinking him being rash, but his action raised far more awareness about this issue than the typical proper channel.<p>Rails devs (some, not all of them) had dismissed his complaint because ""Every Rails developer hears about attr_accessible."" Well, I'll be the first to say that I can't remember the last time that this update_attributes vulnerability had been pointed out to me. I certainly can remember all the times that Rails docs reminds me to use their sanitizing helpers when making ActiveRecord queries.<p>To be fair, I haven't developed apps that required the use of user-facing access to update_attributes, and maybe when I got around to using that, I would've wisely consulted the dev guides to make sure I was following best practice. But knowing me, I probably would've likely thought, ""Well, that seems simple enough, here goes.""<p>It's not that the logic behind this vulnerability is hard to understand...in retrospect, it's as clear and blatant as the processes that lead to SQL injection.<p>But surgical patients die because elite surgeons sometimes forget to wash their hands (Google ""Atul Gawande checklist""). It's not an impossibility that a skilled dev team would overlook the update_attributes issue.<p>The Rails team was right in arguing that this wasn't a security risk given a half-competent dev. But they were looking at the problem from the wrong perspective and assumed that everyone is as familiar with Rails best practices as they were. So how else could Homakov convince them otherwise other than pricking a high-profile dev group?<p>What if Homakov managed to alert the Github team, and they managed to fix it quietly? Github would be safe but thousands of Rails sites would still be operating in ignorance. It truly stinks for the Github group that they had to respond to a five-alarm emergency on a Sunday...on the other hand, I think there are going to be a lot of Rails devs who are thankful that they (involuntarily) took one for the team.

3666687,comment,3666158,3666158,1,0,yo-mf,,,"It is hard to argue with a platform that offers global visibility wrapped in a very polished and professional production.  The benefits touted by DEMO’s producers are top-tier media exposure, boost in sales, landing valuable partnerships and securing funding.  Having attended several DEMO conferences and other similar conferences, there are plenty of startups that have managed to come away with positive results.<p>While I would not take away from the obvious value of DEMO and similar launch conferences, early stage start-ups need to think long and hard whether they are even ready to launch.  In lean start-up parlance, most early stage start-ups are still in Customer Discovery and Validation.  If you have not locked down what your market type is, what problem you are solving and what customers would buy from you, making a big splash could be a very costly mistake.  I have seen too many start-ups go to these events and come away poorer without any results to show for it.<p>All that being said, like with many decisions, it is the execution that counts.  You were going for free, so you had a huge opportunity to make the most of the time.  To simply expect to show up however and get attention is naive.  The press want interesting stories and you are competing with 50 other companies, all vying for attention.  You could have built up interest in numerous ways by being proactive and creative to build up interest.  For example, you could have pulled together a Social Media SWAT team of friends/family/business partners to tweet, Like, and push your story out there.  Instead, you simply showed up, which is kind of like building a web app and simply expecting people to visit.<p>As with anything, it was a learning experience, but I would not use this experience to color your views on conferences.  You just need to understand how best to utilize these tools to your advantage.",1330959649

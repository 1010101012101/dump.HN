I mostly work in Python, so it&#x27;s not an option, but even if it were, using types for this stuff is probably a pretty heavy solution in some cases. Obviously, that depends on your type system, but for most of them having to define new types for different types of array indexes would bre <i>really</i> clumsy.<p>As soon as you open the types basket you have quite a lot of overhead that you didn&#x27;t have before (it&#x27;s a tradeoff, as ever). Not only that, but types won&#x27;t help you on the readability front - not without an IDE. Spolskey&#x27;s argument is that a naming convention can make the code look obviously wrong, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that.<p>Hungarian notation has its place. I&#x27;ve used it before, and I&#x27;ll do it again. Used correctly it can make the code safer and clearer.

Someone with kids could write a similar list with advice that would be good for some and bad for others.<p>I bet a lot of parents, in good faith, give their children bad advice. For instance, <i>&quot;get a good education so you have something to fall back on&quot;</i>. That may be good advice for some - probably even the majority of people. For others it will be terrible advice.<p>Knowing the background and credentials of an author (age, experience, works, kids/no kids etc) can be valuable and guide the reader. It may help identify whether the advice is relevant and applicable to him/her, but it shouldn&#x27;t discredit or disqualify the author or work in itself.<p>In this case, Sam just chose to share the answer he gave a friend who most likely will find it more valuable than someone who is living an entirely different life.

I&#x27;ve recommended them to numerous friends and every one of them couldn&#x27;t be happier. The value is simply tremendous and these changes make their offerings even that much more amazing.<p>The dashboard, while useful, always felt like it was put together rapidly to integrate a bunch of disparate parts of such a huge service like Cloudflare. Compared to the incredible service offerings, the dashboard was not one of the best parts of Cloudflare. Some data points were a bit off, some charts didn&#x27;t work quite right, and you had to hop in and out of various <i>parts</i> of Cloudflare to get things done. Some stuff in settings, over there, some stuff in the charts over there, some stats here, but not there.<p>Now, the dashboard is just as amazing as the service. Kudos to the overall implementation of the information architecture and user desires for the service. What a tremendous upgrade to an already valuable offering. All of the important settings and information are now within arm&#x27;s reach and easy to find. The new charts, stats, and graphs are absolutely amazing and insightful without being frivolous. There&#x27;s much more detail and new data to work with. The responsiveness of the dashboard itself has also increased a huge amount, which I&#x27;m sure was no small technical feat.<p>Very well done to all involved.

But then every company that engages in this does it differently.<p>Even so Google is different in the high-level meta structure of how it is doing it differently, since it has a <i>both</i> an established and still operational more traditional, more flexible, more general, and less streamlined system and the new, experimental, less flexible, more specific, and more streamlined system. It&#x27;s essentially do a <i>public</i> (not &quot;visible only to insiders&quot;, though obviously the operational details of the results are unlikely to be public) real-business-at-stake side-by-side test of different options.<p>> As such I would guess Google will end up acquiring only those patents that are actually useful and people underprice.<p>I suspect that there are a wide range of potential patents that have expected value <i>to Google</i> that exceeds their expected value to most (and possibly any) other market participant that could actually muster the resources to pay that value, so I don&#x27;t think &quot;underpriced&quot; is the only option.<p>I also don&#x27;t think &quot;useful&quot; in the sense that the patent actually covers a useful invention is necessary, anything that might provide a remotely colorable case for a Google-hostile entity to use against something useful Google does or might do in the life of the patent (even if it doesn&#x27;t <i>actually</i> cover the thing Google is concerned about, and even if it wouldn&#x27;t survive scrutiny in a lawsuit) can have positive net utility for Google to secure to prevent a hostile party from doing so if the price tag is less than the expected cost of defeating it in a lawsuit times the probability of such a suit should a hostile party get a hold of it.<p>> Google may very well get some good patents submitted, but if they don&#x27;t negotiate, they will either leave them on the table or pay more than they&#x27;re worth.<p>Paying above-market price but spending less resources on the pre-purchase process than would be spent getting down to market price can be a net win. An even bigger net win if it makes Google such an attractive place to shop your patents that the most threatening patents that would otherwise get picked up by Google-hostile entities end up getting shopped to Google first.",1430256985

In other words, an alternative, parallel criminal justice system that doesn&#x27;t rely on incarceration or criminal records.<p>The rest is just adjustments to police response in the area.<p>The catch is it requires <i>support</i> from the community.  You need the people it lists[1] (i.e. enough of the community) behind the effort.  Otherwise there&#x27;s nobody to show up to the intervention meetings, and nobody to call police for aggressive intervention.  And even if the community is behind it, the police and prosecutors have to be willing to agree to such deals, and set up such meetings.<p>This kind of non-criminal intervention not only has a good chance (much better chance than prison does) of changing dealers&#x27; minds about drug dealing, but their change in attitudes can also help change the minds of other drug dealers they&#x27;re associated with.  It also doesn&#x27;t upend their lives with felony convictions.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting also that this works because drug dealing socially isolates drug dealers from people who otherwise could help them.  People involved with drugs won&#x27;t always admit to it, even to close friends and relatives; and friends and relatives may not <i>want</i> to know or be involved, because that might put <i>them</i> at risk of being charged with drug crimes.  Decriminalizing drugs would have much the same effect of removing barriers between drug dealers and their relatives and communities.  The one thing this intervention approach misses, compared to decriminalization, is that while drugs remain illegal, the pathologies of black markets, created by criminalization, remain.<p>Who still thinks that our prison system works, on average, to rehabilitate?  Those criminals who are rehabilitated do so in spite of the prison system and criminal justice system, not because of it. There&#x27;s just overall not enough will or resources to go with a more productive intervention/psychological/sociological approach to most crimes.<p>[1] > &quot;[When three drug dealers accepted the offer] they met not only police and prosecutors, but also family members, people from their communities, pastors from local churches and representatives from social-service agencies.

After all, those instruments were headed for nuclear refineries and submarines.<p>Per EETimes [1]: MISRA C is a subset of the C language. In particular, it is based on the ISO/IEC 9899:1990 C standard, which is identical to the ANSI X3.159-1989 standard, often called C ’89. Thus every MISRA C program is a valid C program. The MISRA C subset is defined by 141 rules that constrain the C language. Correspondingly, MISRA C++ is a subset of the ISO/IEC 14882:2003 C++ standard. MISRA C++ is based on 228 rules, many of which are refinements of the MISRA C rules to deal with the additional realities of C++.<p>I did a quick search for Tesla programming jobs and they do command a familiarity with MISRA C, so somewhere it is being used by Tesla in their firmware.  That standard is supposed to ensure security and reliability in firmware programming for critical devices, such as motor vehicles.  I wonder if this knowledge expands upon this challenge and other avenues for hacking Tesla, and also I wonder if MISRA C practices extend to outlying modules in the vehicle...<p>[0] MISRA C:  <a href=""http://www.misra-c.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.misra-c.com/</a>

But I bet 9/10 people will never feel they have this luxury, and 8/10 will be right.<p>> And in the truest sense of &quot;most people&quot; I would bet that &quot;most people take whatever work they can get, and sometimes something sticks&quot; is probably more accurate.<p>I am glad you&#x27;ve brought up this point, but in some ways this &quot;first world problems&quot; narrative is itself elitist: people who are less wealthy, people who live in poor and authoritarian countries (both are sets my parents and I once belonged to) _still_ have concerns about fulfilling work, about balancing professional and/or academic success with family obligations, and suffer from rejection, feelings of inadequacy, failure to live up to expectations of others, and the like.<p>Even more-so, many of the tradeoffs described play into choices people have to make in regards to joining &quot;the elite&quot;. For some, a decision to be happy/fulfilled might mean forsaking the &quot;elite&quot;/&quot;privileged&quot; status. I still remember the waning days of the dot-com boom, when my family&#x27;s immigration lawyer was horrified that I chose to study CS: &quot;but all the jobs will be outsourced&quot;, &quot;computers will program themselves&quot;. Programming (or &quot;tech&quot;) wasn&#x27;t held in high esteem when sama and I entered college: class sizes were all times low, (for those who are in Silicon Valley) 237 was the &quot;dot com graveyard&quot;, and $1300 for a 2-bedroom within Cupertino school district was considered outrageously high.<p>Nonetheless, There is an important caveat I would add to what sama says -- and I think you&#x27;ve been hinting it in your post -- &quot;liking what you do for work&quot; isn&#x27;t the same as &quot;following your passion&quot;. Factors such as skill and aptitude for the given work, opportunities for finding such work, etc... all contribute to &quot;liking what you do&quot;. I don&#x27;t know if I am misreading sama or if this is an omission in sama&#x27;s essay (somehow, I believe it&#x27;s the former!), but often time liking what one does, also requires building some aptitude in things one (thinks) they don&#x27;t like: e.g., &quot;I hate maths!&quot; (extrapolated from &quot;I dislike continuous maths the way it was taught in (US) high school, so I never approached discrete maths, linear algebra, etc...&quot;) had stopped far too many people from building an enjoyable career in a maths-heavy (but not in any way exclusively mathematical, especially as far as industry work goes) fields. Likewise, &quot;fulfilling&quot; isn&#x27;t the same as &quot;fun&quot;. To paraphrase a person much smarter than me that I worked for -- twice -- eating a good meal is fun, going hiking is fun, watching a movie is fun; building software (or, writing a cookbook, exploring/charting a nature preserve to create safe and sustainable hiking trails, writing a screenplay or acting in a movie, watching a movie critically for a review, etc...) is, on the other hand, fulfilling and deeply enjoyable but not necessarily &quot;fun&quot; (even if I&#x27;ll call it &quot;fun&quot;, as I usually do) in the exact same way.",1430255746

For a long while, the only way to reliably edit Word documents was using Microsoft Word (half of it being undocumented, and half of it being documented as &quot;this is supposed to do whatever Microsoft Office does&quot;), so you effectively needed to embed Word within your program in order to reliably edit Word documents.  A lot of that changed<p>In the open source world, there are canonical tools, but traditionally it&#x27;s been about the format being open and accessible explicitly so you don&#x27;t need to rely on/run a third-party program to do the manipulation, rather either roll your own manipulation routines following the documented standard (thereby strengthening the ecosystem with multiple implements, hopefully) or use a library (that the canonical tool may be based on/also use).<p>Both schemes have their advantages and disadvantages.  It would be an interesting study in why/how the different ecosystems evolved to favor one over the other, how that has changed over time, and how that&#x27;s influenced the size and robustness of the respective ecosystems.  There&#x27;s probably a lot of influence on the Windows/RPC side coming from the canonical tools being primarily interface GUI interfaces, which is then natural to want to &quot;drive&quot; or &quot;control&quot; remotely, vs &quot;headless&quot; interfaces that are able/meant to be scripted as a first order requirement.",1430255671

You can always increase the specificity of a skill to the point where it&#x27;s possible to become the best at it. If you want an example, it&#x27;s near impossible for most people to become the best programmer (there can only be one), but go to github and pick a random library and pick the most active contributor to that library and you&#x27;ve most likely found someone who is the best at that domain. Then look at the number of libraries on GitHub. Then you&#x27;ll start to see how many people are the best at a very specific domain of knowledge.",1430255124

The presentation takes a java program, finds a problem with it and fixes the problem in both java and Go. Go&#x27;s solution starts with a `Name() string` method, but then he drops the method completely in favor of a public Name field instead. Other links in that google search are clear examples of a naive java-to-go translation with half a dozen `GetX() X` methods.<p>> How else do you write a function that can take multiple types of structs, all of which have a Name field, and select that field?<p>That presentation that you linked to says to use struct embedding aka composition. And if you don&#x27;t want to do that then I&#x27;d say you&#x27;re &quot;probably&quot; framing the problem wrong, but we really need a more concrete example to discuss this further otherwise we&#x27;ll just be talking past each other.",1430255078

It is not uncommon to need to gather all these records if, for example, you go to a research hospital for treatment.<p>The only practical method today is to keep your records yourself as they accumulate. When you see a doctor, ask for a copy of his consultation notes. If any tests are done, ask for copies of the full results. If you have imaging done, request a copy. Most medical imaging facilities can provide CD-ROMs with files in standard formats or that come packaged with viewing software.<p>Most importantly, make your own notes on what has transpired and what the doctor said.<p>If you ever do request all your records, you will discover that many physicians keep TERRIBLE notes. Sometimes the only record of a consultation is a hand-written form containing a few impressions and notes on vital signs. Thankfully, this is becoming less common, but even doctors that have implemented an electronic health record system that forces them to enter standard consultation records don&#x27;t always put the full depth of the discussion you had in those records.

Algumas empresas ainda fazem este tipo de promoo, contudo usam com pouca frequncia.<p>Como surgiu a Cuponagem<p>A primeira empresa a usar os cupons como ao de marketing foi a Coca-Cola, que em 1888, distribuiu cupons que permitiam retirar uma garrafa de refrigerante de graa para que as pessoas pudessem experiment-lo. Esta estratgia chegou a resgatar mais de 8,5 milhes de cupons entre os anos de 1894 e 1913.\nNo precisa nem perguntar se a estratgia deu certo, no  verdade?<p>A Cuponagem nos ltimos anos<p>Com a crise financeira mundial que ocorreu em 2008, diferente de como a Coca-cola usou os cupons, a Cuponagem foi usada para aumentar as vendas, j que os cupons davam bons descontos em um momento que todos precisavam economizar, ajudando a movimentar a economia.\nAinda hoje os americanos usam a Cuponagem constantemente. Os cupons ficam disponveis em supermercados, em jornais ou nos sites das lojas. Por ano so oferecidos cerca de 3 bilhes de cupons de desconto.<p>A Cuponagem Online<p>E como foi dito, os americanos foram disponibilizando os cupons nos sites de suas lojas, migrando um pouco do que era fsico para o mundo virtual.\nAt hoje, os cupons de desconto fsicos so bastante usados no dia a dia dos norte americanos. Cerca de 95% usaram algum cupom de desconto tradicional, e apenas 11% usaram o cupom de desconto online. Porm, acredita-se que essa migrao ocorra logo e os cupons fsicos sejam trocados pelos virtuais gradativamente.<p>No prximo post falaremos sobre as vantagens e benefcios da Cuponagem Online.",1358978333

5105546,comment,5104783,5104783,11,0,greghinch,,,"This seems like an inevitable outcome of everything that ""we"" (the startup and tech communities) are doing. Nearly every startup business I've seen on HN is about an optimization of an existing industry. Almost invariably, optimization means cutting people out of the loop, as people are quite slow at a lot of the tasks computers are suited for.<p>The problem is of course the growing disparity between pay. As the existing middle is eliminated, the majority of people are trending towards the lower segment of pay (the 29/2/~70 ratio mentioned). Ideally we'd find a way to elevate a large portion of those in the lower 70% area to higher paying jobs. I think the reality is, many of those people probably will never be suited for jobs in the $100k+ range. The only solution I can see being viable is further socialization (in the US) of things like medical care, transportation, etc. in order to ensure that just because you don't have a high salary, doesn't mean you can't have a high quality of life. Either that or accept that the US is devolving into a 3rd world country.<p>Bring on the ""socialist"" flames.",1358978289
5105545,comment,5098873,5103100,1,0,geophile,,,"I have the sense that a PhD in computer science is harder to obtain now because the field is more mature, there are many more people working in it, and it just takes more time and effort to get to the point that you're doing original work.<p>Also, my impression is that, in the USA at least, the economy is fundamentally much more fragile, with the disappearance of the middle class. Someone starting out now does not really have the luxury of doing something purely out of passion. The penalty for needing to change course is much higher now. I think.<p>I disagree with you on the role of industry in computer science research. In the 80s, there were many companies in which research was happening: Xerox PARC, IBM, Digital, and to a lesser extent at other computer companies. I worked at Computer Corporation of America, a mid-sized software company, in the mid 80s (after UMass, before startups), and they did some amazing, DARPA-funded research in databases. Now it's Microsoft and IBM. Oracle, Apple and others are obviously doing leading-edge work, but I think those efforts are more closely aligned with products. I think there was far more pure research done by software/compute companies 30 years ago.",1358978284

On my laptop I often use the trackpoint over relevant keyboard shortcuts because it's already right under my fingers, but on my desktop I much prefer using the shortcuts due to the overhead of switching.<p>- For a movement that's three cells or fewer, I find it hard to imagine that mouse would be faster (unless perhaps it's set to follow the cursor?). I assume the study averages over a variety of distances across the entire screen. I hope that most vim users aren't using hjkl for adjustments of more than three or so cells. A combination of {}wb and especially ?/ will handle the bulk of jumps quickly. hjkl are then useful keys for adjusting just a couple of characters to refine your jump -- and now they're already right under your fingers.",1358978059

5105489,comment,5104783,5104783,4,0,RyanZAG,,,"This has been a trend over all of human history. Going to keep it brief and technically incorrect to paint a picture...<p>Initially, everyone was required to either hunt or gather food (probably). After a bit, humanity settled down into farming, and fewer people were required to keep everybody fed. This allowed for more time for childbirth. Better understanding of agriculture led to the creation of larger towns with specialized jobs such as blacksmiths and stables which led to farm animals helping to improve yields even further. To create the tools, some people had to go into mining jobs.<p>The pattern here is that advancement allows fewer people in each economic area to provide the same benefits, freeing up labor for new economic areas.<p>So clearly, the modern move to automate jobs isn't <i>necessarily</i> anything new. People are now free to move into creating accounting software instead of manually filling out journals. The problem occurs when the people freed up from advances do not have any new work to move into.<p>The result may simply be de-urbanization - people moving back into the countryside to grow their own food. Most people can afford to buy a small plot of land in the middle of nowhere (small piece of land in the middle of Africa is practically free). Or the result may be socialism. Or the result may be new economic sectors being revealed by innovation. Fortune telling won't get us very far.",1358977617

Some advice I would give to anybody who wants to learn to code from scratch:<p>- Focus. Don't do it on the side, it would take too long. Treat learning to code as if it was your regular job(I tried to do 40-60hrs per week, I did about 2000hrs of coding in my first year)<p>- Don't hurry. Don't obsess about efficiency and how you use your time. You will waste tons of time on stupid bugs and knowledge you don't really need, that's just part of the learning process. Focus on putting in those hours week after week and you will see results.<p>- Work on a project. The only way to truely understand how things work is to actually use them. Don't hide yourself behind books, try to apply everything you learn asap.<p>- Give yourself permission to suck. This is really hard if you're older (I was 30 when I started to code). If you already have a career, you're not accustomed to be utterly clueless anymore. I had already forgotten how slow and painful it is to learn something from scratch. So give yourself a break and judge yourself the same way you would judge a stranger. Don't expect to become stellar in a matter of months just because you're smart.

I did it in Word using the company standard document template, and it looked alright. It sat on various bosses desks for a week or so, then got NFA'ed. So I re-did it in LaTeX and submitted it again under a slightly different title. Result? Approved within a day. Something about seeing projected revenue figures in an 'academic' format gave enough weight to my utterly fabricated numbers to get the thing signed off. It's insta-cred, at least in a non-academic setting.<p>However, moving from Word to LaTeX is a bit like leaving one bad relationship for another. Word beats your documents up constantly: splitting paragraphs, applying random styles, auto-numbering lists like a toddler with a calculator, positioning figures anywhere but where you want them, and so on forever. Getting even slightly complex results out of it is a constant struggle. LaTeX doesn't do any of that: your document will be represented perfectly every time; every semantically significant structural element will just work as it should; and you never have to think about presentation at all. It's intoxicating, working with such an elegant tool. But fail to treat it right, get even one tiny backslash in the wrong place, and you get <i>nothing</i> useful, just a screenful of errors.<p>If this were a movie, LaTeX would be played by Penelope Cruz: she'd take eight hours to do her make up before a dinner date, bewitch all the other diners with her beauty, and then dump her drink on the hero and storm out of the restaurant when he accidentally makes eye contact with the waitress.

I also see absolutely no reason why supporting regulation of short term rentals somehow commits you to supporting a failed section 8 program, other than that the government is involved in both.<p>You left out option e) urge your representative in government to limit short term rentals, and once this laws are in place, bring a civil lawsuit or take some other legally coercive measure if your neighbor refuses to comply.<p>That said, I would prefer to see these laws kept as local as possible, and many communities will be perfectly happy to allow short term rentals, as it will provide them with a new way to profit from their property.  I'd agree that if a local district decides to allow AirBnBs to proliferate, and you aren't happy, then you must move - preferably to a place that doesn't allow them.  You will accept that restriction in exchange for the benefits you believe it brings you.<p>Keep in mind, there's a strong undercurrent of libertarianism that supports heavy decentralization rather than zero regulation across the board - you just have to promise not to try to impose your will on the next township over.",1358974828

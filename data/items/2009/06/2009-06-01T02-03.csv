First, if I have to figure out how to use it by trial and error in the dark, that's a problem.  Second, if I'm expecting to live there for years, I'm going to have to replace them, and then, very likely, I'm going to have a bunch of wonderfully different switches, and one that stands out because I could get it at Home Depot, and I couldn't find anyplace to buy one like the others.<p>All that said, I prefer the wide rocker switches over the lever switches that I grew up with, so I'm not knocking change, just variety. :)",1243825111

For that test to work I would think that one would literally have to ""see"" the color of a number almost as though it were a hallucination.<p>I can only speak for myself obviously, but for me a number just invokes a certain color in my mind, almost as though the number has an aura.

If you're trying to solve human problems, spontaneous order from some sort of survival-of-the-fittest system is not good enough. Things that are useful to humans require conscious design.  Spontaneous order gave us wood, but it took a human engineer to design the wheel. Evolution by natural selection never could have designed such a tool spontaneously.<p>Sure, the economy is a lot more complicated than that, and the precautionary principle is sound advice.

I think it's really important to think of Wave not in terms of the front-end they were showing off, but rather in terms of the underlying protocol that powered it. Google envisions it as a sort of SMTP 2.0, powering most person-to-person communication on the internet; if (and only if) the industry gets behind it unilaterally, I think it has a real chance of success.<p>The paucity of existing documentation can be forgiven, but only to a point -- it's definitely on Google to make the complex elements of that protocol (and there are many) developer-accessible.

635397,comment,635192,635192,0,0,Elepsis,,,"I graduated from Georgia Tech's CS program in December, so I can hopefully give you a few useful pointers.<p>First of all, while GT is definitely your top (and really only) choice in the state for any of those three departments, you don't necessarily have to start out there. Look up Southern Polytechnic State University - it's in Marietta, just a short ways outside Atlanta, and it has a few serious perks for your situation:
- It's a whole lot cheaper (about $10k less) than GT is, particularly for students who are not in-state.
- It is an engineering-focused university that will get you up to speed reasonably quickly and let you start taking some classes that will transfer well to GT (but not as well or smoothly as you might expect, so be careful).
- Transfering from Southern Poly to GT is almost a guarantee -- as long as you do well there, you are pretty much certain to be admitted.<p>Second, whatever university you wind up going to, be sure to get involved in activities outside of class. They don't all have to be focused on programming or startup stuff, either -- my time working on GT's student newspaper helped in my job search nearly as much as my degree itself. Plus, the things I did had the additional benefit of exposing me to a much wider group of people than the typical CS crowd, and keeping me sane during tougher times.<p>Last, don't give up, especially once you actually get into university. GT's engineering, science and CS programs tend to smack people down in their first couple of semesters, and the worst thing you could do is let that get you down to the point of dropping back to your current situation.",1243823234

I mean, for those from war torn places, immigrants who worked hard, a secure job to take care of your family and see your children grow up isn't a bad dream at all.  We simply have the luxury of making that our baseline.<p>If anything, my take-away is to recognize that those things aren't bad in it of themselves, but just don't mistake the dreams of others for your own.",1243822211

I completely agree with you that taking 3 semesters (a year, a year and a half?) just to get up to speed would be silly, especially if you do in fact have an aptitude for math.<p>If you've never taken calculus it would probably serve you well to take it in an actual classroom (possibly at night while working?), but trig can easily be self taught from a book. If you need a little extra help, contact the math department of a local university and ask if they have a list of students who are available for tutoring. It would be a small cost to meet with someone once or twice a week to stay on track with your self study, compared to an actual college class.",1243821692

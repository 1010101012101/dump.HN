It could have been a bug in Google's code (like their automated diagnostic reporting ""Your account has no credit card associated with it"", which is contrary to the truth and scares me because if the right hand of their system is as borked as the left hand then that very well could be my problem).

737565,comment,737460,737496,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"I went to a free iPhone Developer Tech Talk where they specifically addressed this policy. Not too many developers in the audience seemed thrilled about it, but it was laid out in front of them. If a customer comes to you for whatever reason asking for a refund, Apple's official policy is that it is your problem to deal with. I specifically made a note about it because I caught the Apple representative's very lawyer-esque response which was to minimize what he said at all about the issue, except to really say ""it's your problem"".<p>I might add that I don't think this policy is due to maliciousness on Apple's part. The reality is that trying to handle refunds has a number of logistical nightmares associated with it, namely:<p>1. Refund standards and laws within contiguous regions that the store serves are inconsistent. For instance, just because you have Apple Store USA, doesn't mean that there can be one consistent refund policy. Now multiply this problem by the number of countries that the store is present in.<p>2. A great number of customers would use refunds as a way to ""try before you buy"". The numbers would be significantly high enough to cause a problem.<p>Now, there's that old saying that you should never attribute to malice that which can be attributed to ignorance. I strongly suspect Apple's approach to this specific case is a simple case of bureaucratic ignorance. I bet that you have a middle-management type implementing a policy that was designed for him/her based upon very specific legal advice. The situation has probably been flagged for attention by the legal department and upper management, but until a policy is designed, they have to address the current situation using known protocols.<p>If you were at the Tech Talk that I was, Apple apologized for a lot of the iTunes Store stupidity that developers were complaining about online. They also explained why things were the way they were and it wasn't due to Apple being malicious.",1249228145

I love those guys, really I do. But you can't keep changing missions every time a president takes office, you can't spread the pork out to every state you'd like to, and you can't run a serious manned spaceflight program on a shoestring budget. They're totally dependent on public opinion and don't have a clue in the world as to how to capitalize on it.<p>In short, NASA is a political animal masquerading as a science agency. As such, it's not much use for controlling/promoting spaceflight. If JFK were alive today he'd be dismayed.<p>Remember his words? We choose to do these things not because they are easy but because they are difficult. Big missions, big drama, big heroes, big goals for the nation. Now the article talks about sending astronauts to Langrange points! That's going to be as exciting as watching cars rust.<p>NASA needs to get out of spaceflight implementation altogether and become a spaceflight promoter.Write the checks (which it seems to be very good at) and let somebody else worry about breakthrough propulsion techniques. Farm out funding of the International Space Station to the State Department.<p>Time to hang it up guys. You were great back in the day, but back in the day you had a clear, steady,long-term mission.

The first was about a time when he would get somewhat discouraged after studying for hours and making little progress.  So at one point he asked some of his really talented classmates (more talented than him) how much they studied and how far they got.  They all replied that after hours of studying, they would maybe get through 3-4 pages of the textbook.  It was somewhat enlightening for him to learn that even the geniuses couldn't breeze through the material like one might breeze through a dime-store novel.<p>The second anecdote was about the time my father was getting letters of recommendation for grad school.  He got the usual positive letters, each with a couple of paragraphs praising his abilities and intelligence.  My father then asked one of his friends (a much more talented friend) if he could look at one of <i>his</i> letters.  The friend's letter consisted of a single sentence which contained the words ""Nobel prize material"".  It was at this point that my father gave up physics.<p>Anyhoo, I guess my point is that grit is of course important, but as other commenters have noted, talent can't be dismissed either.

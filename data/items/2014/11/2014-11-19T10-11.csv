However, we&#x27;ve learned a substantial amount about what we&#x27;re doing since then and are working with systems that are only poorly represented in those architectures. Many times we find that it&#x27;s not possible to tack on the latest innovations to these legacy cores in a meaningful way, and that the only way to incorporate them properly would be a substantial rewrite, so we just sort of hack them on top and pretend.<p>I think it&#x27;s a fairly normal process in most engineering fields to every few decades, reimagine some core technologies in light of new production methods and materials.<p>I honestly think it might be worth experimenting with fundamentally green field designs on various core technologies (like operating systems), in the sense of putting a serious development effort behind them (5-10 years of development work to reach parity with current ones) rather than purely as doctoral experiments that clearly aren&#x27;t production ready.<p>There are lots of interesting approaches that aren&#x27;t ever going to make it to market because no one wants to put in the time before the current approach completely fails, rather than just become an increasingly large stack of kludges.",1416394518

Very few of them pan out to actual deals.<p>A good plan to avoid wasting your time is to give them a ballpark figure up front for what it will cost to make this happen.  That figure should not be less than six figures if it involves any significant effort on your part.<p>If you&#x27;ve already packaged everything up, and it really is as simple as delivering a VM image, you might only quote them 20X - 100X the retail price of your most expensive  subscription plan.  Naturally, this will be an annual contract, with the first year paid in advance and a fair amount of lead time.<p>Keep in mind that your email outlining this will typically be the last contact between you and the customer, since they&#x27;re often simply middle manager types with an expectation that the price will be the same as your &quot;Big Customer&quot; subscription level, except that it will somehow magically run behind their firewall.  Your mail will simultaneously give them a heart attack and correct their understanding of Enterprise licensing.

8629287,comment,8628944,8629084,0,0,garretraziel,,,"I have Jolla phone and I have mixed feelings about it. Sailfish OS is interesting - learning how to use it has steep learning curve (but once you get used to it, it&#x27;s perhaps faster to do something with it than on any other phone). It is sometimes unreliable (my Jolla randomly shuts down, sometimes several times in a row, see <a href=""https://together.jolla.com/question/7144/jolla-randomly-shuts-down-10819/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://together.jolla.com/question/7144/jolla-randomly-shut...</a>). There are other quirks here and there, guys from Jolla are fixing them one after another, but I would say that Sailfish OS is still in beta state.<p>It is really developer friendly device. It has awesome SDK and it isn&#x27;t trying to restrict you by any means. But even that, there are not really that many applications for Sailfish OS and only few of them are good. And there is literally no official client for anything and that brings problems - for example, several people were banned from WhatsApp for using Mitakuuluu (WhatsApp client for Sailfish OS). There isn&#x27;t full-featured Facebook client, there isn&#x27;t client for my bank account or for my operator. App for public transport for your country? Nope, it isn&#x27;t there. Sure, you can use Android apps (not from Google Play though, you have to use Yandex store or Amazon store), but: 1) There are no Google Play Services - that means no integration with Google Account, no maps, no that pretty cool Google Inbox app, Google is moving a lot of things into Google Play Services, 2) there will be problems with any non-trivial app. Games are OK, but GPS tracking? Didn&#x27;t work when app wasn&#x27;t active (so you have to have screen on). Wanted to try Pressy? Doesn&#x27;t work, it wants to access your Google account. Besides, if you are buying this device convicted that you will use Android apps on it, why not buy Android phone?<p>To end this comment with something positive, I could say that this is &quot;OK&quot; device. It is impressive that they are able to build this device with that small team. They are listening to community, they are updating their OS frequently. Besides some quirks, Sailfish OS is as good as any other mobile phone OS. It runs fast and it is based on Linux, Qt5 and even Wayland compositor. You can be more confident that you are not being watched (at least they say). Your inner geek will be pleased. But at the end of the day, you will look at other people phones, they are playing that new cool game, using that new cool app you always wanted to try, trying that new HN or Reddit client, using Google Inbox, using Instagram Hyperlapse, using their expensive gadgets, fitness trackers, using their phones to find how will they get home and your phone has just suddenly rebooted again.",1416394241

8629284,comment,8628843,8629142,0,0,wernerb,,,"I also enjoyed an education from public schools in The Netherlands (NL) but I feel this article is more about the teacher than the system. Besides, the NL system is also district-based and we recently started &quot;grading&quot; schools according to standardized tests and then publishing the results. This will probably (and already has to a certain degree) result in parents wanting their children to go to the schools that score highest, in turn, those schools request more &quot;bijdrage&quot; (extra cost, for supposed &#x27;school trips&#x27; and &#x27;books&#x27;), in turn making those schools less diverse (i.e. more &quot;white&quot;) and in turn making schools that used to perform nominally, worse.<p>The teacher is what makes the student, and unfortunately I have also witnessed PABO students barely able to pass basic spelling/math tests. Those students will probably only go on to teach toddlers/basic grades, but due to teacher shortages it is conceivable that they will eventually move on to teach higher grades as well.<p>In my opinion, there is no easy short-term solution to the problem of adequate teacher-levels due to regulation/unions etc. We parents should try our best to partially circumvent the entire issue by avoiding &quot;permanent damage&quot; is done by  staying up to date with what the child learns and focus on rote-skills that are hard for teachers to supervise in large class-rooms but immensely important when those kids grow up: maths and writing.<p>Perhaps this will get easier as teaching/assignments are increasingly interactive, allowing the parent to gain a better view of the child&#x27;s performance and problems. Here&#x27;s me hoping this e-learning thing takes off as soon as possible, with teachers perhaps evolving to simply guiding their pupils with extra support (if necessary), social interaction (digital age might not be all thats cracked up to be with encouraging social skills), learning techniques, and job planning as kids these days have no idea what they realistically are going to do for work later.<p>EDIT: Added some perhaps off-topic personal vision of what a teacher should do in the future when MOOCS/e-learning takes off.",1416394209

What is the lesson learned here? Is it that common code is not always a good idea, or is it that we need to write it in a way that is more _modular_ and easier to take apart and remove the blocks we dont need? Would such a change be even possible now?",1416393731

A <i>lot</i> of Unix programmers tended to behave as if &quot;long&quot; was the largest native type (&quot;long long&quot; on 32-bit uses a pair of registers). They have to scrub their whole code base for things like assuming an object&#x27;s size or array index will always fit on a &quot;long&quot;.<p>For software originally developed for Windows, LLP64 was supposed to make porting easier, since unlike on the Unix world (where &quot;long&quot; could be 32-bit or 64-bit), a lot of Windows programs assumed a LONG was always 32-bit, and that assumption was baked into file formats and IPC protocols.<p>Newly developed software has it easier; programmers nowadays keep in mind that there are relevant systems where sizeof(long) < sizeof(size_t), and since the C99 standard they have the stdint.h types to help (even on Windows with its pre-C99 compilers, since it&#x27;s easy to find a working stdint.h for them).<p>----<p>As for Mac OS X, the porting problem is Carbon.

Whether you&#x27;re frustrated or not. Unless it was extremely clear from the context it was just a joking &quot;haha we should ..&quot; with no intent to follow through, <i>then</i>, maybe then it becomes acceptable to say these sorts of things in an informal off-the-record setting, assuming you&#x27;re sufficiently acquainted with the current company that you know they won&#x27;t be put off by such a tasteless remark.<p>What he called for was a personal attack on someone&#x27;s personal life. With a straight face, to his hired media mouthpiece. It&#x27;s IMO not very different (though obviously less illegal) from telling your hired muscle &quot;we should teach that person a lesson, beat them up a little&quot;, with no intent to follow through, <i>obviously</i>. The window to make that last bit over-abundantly clear evaporates within a minute or so.

8629182,comment,8626826,8628926,0,0,noobermin,,,"First of all, I thank you for responding and bringing statistics to this conversation. You are right that I seemed to have generalize what my friends said to all young Koreans, at least in the way I wrote it. I should have been more careful with what I said.<p>I think the article you linked actually gives ammunition to my claim that as time passes and memories fade with them, reunification is becoming less popular. I mean, the headline ends with the clause: &quot;dreams of unity fade into past for young South Koreans.&quot; One of the 20-somethings interviewed here opposes unification based on economic and financial grounds. As another poster commented, though, a majority still do support reunification.<p>With respect to my saying the rest of the world wants them to reunite, I admit that was hyperbole. The reason I said it was that every single comment on this story so far started with the assumption that reunification was right and we want it to happen[1]. I think something closer to the truth is that a lot of us in the western world don&#x27;t necessarily want to see reunification happen as much as we want the North Korean government to fail. Anyone who has heard about the famines and seen pictures of children dead in the street would want that. Reunification, of course, would be the &quot;natural&quot; step after that. However, it&#x27;s ironic that for many South Koreans, they are simply indifferent, or outright opposed to the idea.<p>So, I what I was pointing to was the fact that while a lot of us in the west seem to think reunification is the end goal, a significant number of Koreans, the actual people who we are discussing, do not favor it. I felt it was fair to point that out since the conversation at the time seemed to have hinged on the assumption that it was the right thing and the South Koreans themselves wants to go along with it.<p>Somewhat related, but this [2] has always stuck with me. This video was aired back during the time when tensions were running high and CNN was ablaze with talk about Kim Jong-Un and the NK state-run media said this and that, etc. At that time, I was considering studying in SK for grad school, and the typical response involved some shock that I&#x27;d want to go to a warzone. It&#x27;s ironic that in SK itself, people were much more interested in their pop culture, their daily lives, than the hatred spewing from up North that was littering our news articles here in the west.<p>[1] So by &quot;the rest of the world&quot;, I meant, &quot;you all in the room&quot;, the kind of hyperbole you let out when you want to say a dissenting word against the common opinion.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/international/2013/04/13/coren-psy-south-korea.cnn.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/international/2013/0...</a>",1416392495

I don&#x27;t believe I really meant to say that South Koreans see the North as an enemy but I can see it being understandable that one would feel more lukewarm about being reunited with a group that seems to hate you so much. I think that&#x27;s why I really appreciate you saying this, because you dream for peace while many see and experience strife. That&#x27;s very admirable.<p>Honestly, I personally think it would be almost romantic to see your country reunited. However, I&#x27;m not Korean, so I have no right to tell you reunion is right, or not right, and I&#x27;m concerned that sometimes, us as westerners seem to assume that this is best for this or that country, even when those in that country wish for something else. Either way, I wish you all the best.",1416391449

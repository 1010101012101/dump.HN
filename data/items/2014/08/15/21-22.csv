Here&#x27;s an excerpt:<p>&quot;<i>And another key metric we measure is the average time to service something. So our average is less than a day. So the car is -- so, in most cases we can actually pick up your car, fix anything that&#x27;s wrong with it, and give it back to you, without you even knowing it was gone. So you just tell us like my car is at my office and this is where it is, and we&#x27;ll pick up the car, fix it, and get it back to you before you finish work.<p>Our goal with service is sort of invisible up, which is, is there even -- it&#x27;s like elves [ph] service delivery [ph]. Like you don&#x27;t even see it. It&#x27;s like -- it happens so fast. And once done, you&#x27;ll love it.<p>And so I think there&#x27;s like -- there&#x27;s an interesting opportunity to revolutionize service as well. It&#x27;s not just like, oh, let&#x27;s do the same thing as before. I think it was a lot of lessons learned from a Formula One car approach. So, because we&#x27;re not trying to serve customers for the most amount of money possible in a service, which is typical of the conventional auto industry, we want to get the job done super-fast, and then also make sure that you don&#x27;t -- like we want to anticipate issues so you don&#x27;t have to come back again.<p>And so we actually bring the car and we kind of hit with a pit crew, like a Formula One pit crew. So instead of having one person per bay, the car gets slowly worked on over several days, it actually comes in and a team attacks it, and we&#x27;re constantly improving the tools and the metrics to say, how can we get the car perfect as fast as possible. We actually bring in people from Formula One to help with the training on this. And I think there&#x27;s a real opportunity to revolutionize the way service works.</i>&quot;",1408138879

As soon as the universe&#x27;s mass/energy expanded sufficiently for there to be a time dimension (IOW as soon as the universe was something other than a singularity), the present physical laws applied. Some of the physical constants with which we are familiar may have had different values, but the same set of rules have been in effect since there were four distinct dimensions. This is borne out by the existence and properties of the CMB, as well as other observations.<p>Your use of the term &quot;big bang time&quot; implies that there was, in fact, time, which means four dimensions existed, which means our present physical rules were in effect.<p>One idea has it that the natural forces we evaluate separately now, were unified by the conditions of the early universe, but this idea doesn&#x27;t contradict the notion that basic physical principles were in any way different then.<p>One of the more interesting cosmological ideas is that the positive mass/energy of the universe is exactly balanced by negative gravitational potential energy, as the universe expands and continuing to the present, but only at one specific expansion velocity: what we call escape velocity. If this idea is true, it means the universe could have sprung into existence spontaneously, like a virtual particle pair, without violating the law of conservation of energy. Stephen Hawking explains this idea in his book &quot;The Grand Design&quot;: &quot;Because there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing. Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist. It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going.&quot;",1408138632

If you&#x27;re of the opinion that the very practice of collecting debt is scummy or unethical, then no. Assuming you will allow for at least SOME form of &quot;ethical&quot; debt collection, we&#x27;d have to narrow down what kinds. For instance, just off the top of my head, you&#x27;ve got:\n- Commercial Debt\n- Medical Debt\n- Student Loans\n- Bad Checks<p>Within that you conceivably have debts whose collection is perhaps ethical by nature but not ethical in practice. For instance, as I said earlier, collection on bad checks circumvent many normal collection laws, and you can thus have interest rates of 200% or higher. Another example would be Student Loans, which have their own set of ridiculous loopholes that allow the debt to persist past bankruptcy, past retirement, etc. As someone who was still in college myself only a few years ago, the idea of the financial burden imposed on me for the rest of my life simply for doing the thing that society practically strong-armed me into doing seems, to me, ridiculous; for that reason I am hesitant to call any form of Student Debt collection &quot;ethical&quot; simply because the laws which govern it are atrocious.<p>With that said, I have dealt with many agencies who at least tried to operate on an &quot;ethical&quot; model (usually they collected on medical debt), and they seemed polite and reasonable in their collection efforts. Remember, they&#x27;re in the business to make money. Some agencies will go for the &quot;Make the debtor&#x27;s life as miserable as possible to make them pay up&quot; tactic, which includes harassment, lawsuits, garnishments, etc. I deal with them frequently, and I think they&#x27;re the scum of the Earth (primarily because they talk to me in what I imagine is the same tone as they talk to debtors). Others, however, will simply try to get what they can, and if they CAN&#x27;T--i.e. they realize that continuing to call a guy about a debt when he&#x27;s already stated that he has no job and no savings would be like squeezing blood from a stone--they&#x27;ll stop wasting their time and move on to an account that would be more profitable.<p>Much of the work done by agencies these days is not only getting people to pay, but finding out who is more LIKELY to pay so that the agency can focus its efforts accordingly. This analysis might include things like the line of business, their credit score, their location (they usually figure that areas with a higher average income are more likely to pay), etc.<p>To answer your question succinctly: probably. It would center primarily on whether the percentage of the portfolio that actually pays can sustain the percentage that you&#x27;re willing to let go when pursuing them further would entail questionable tactics.",1408138150

8184282,comment,8182759,8184142,1,0,kasey_junk,,,"If you think that quote refutes my point then I clearly need to clarify what my point was.<p>1) Joel believes that pointers and recursion are concepts that require a way of thinking about higher order abstractions that correlates well with being a good programming hire. So it would make sense if we agreed with him to ask questions about pointers & recursion in interviews, even if we don&#x27;t believe that pointers or recursion are used often in the settings we are hiring for.\n2) Many people have built long careers without using recursion, but that doesn&#x27;t refute the premise because it doesn&#x27;t speak to the higher order abstractions assumption.  Further, in the modern world recursion is no more or less likely to be used than pointers (which would be shocking at one point in the industry) as pointers also are not common.\n3) The central assumption Joel basis his argument on is that pointers and recursion are interesting because reasoning well about them requires a higher level of abstraction.  That higher level of abstraction simply does not exist with Java style references.  So asking about references, while maybe useful in other contexts, doesn&#x27;t have the benefits Joel is arguing for in the same way as pointers.\n4) To relate this back to the article, A) is understanding dynamic programming indicative of some central mental type that will correlate with a good programmer?  B) Does asking questions about the Knapsack problem suss out that understanding.  I suspect, but can&#x27;t prove that the answers are A) not like pointer/recursion understand and B) absolutely not.",1408137566

A higher refresh rate means the screen can switch between frames faster, so it&#x27;s actually displaying repeat frames, but the reduced ghosting makes everything look sharper and smoother.<p>In addition to that - ignoring the snarky paragraph underneath the picture - the example given where you have more intermediate states only applies up to 60-66fps; after this point humans are unable to detect any difference, due to ~15ms of visual delay and afterimages (ghosting!). People often mention studies where someone was able to detect an image displayed for 1/200th of a second or similar durations, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that person can tell apart a <i>moving image</i> at 60fps vs 200fps.

This is why they are so adamant about force pushing web components and polyfills. It&#x27;s the least offensive (and least compute intensive) approach to their web crawler.<p>It&#x27;s much easier and cheaper for them (as a business) to get everyone to adopt a half-baked and half-thought out standard that allows their crawler to extract content from a page without having to execute javascript to understand what is there.<p>With the right APIs, a JavaScript rich web can still be an accessible web for the physically impaired. OS X is proof that this possible. However, this approach makes it far far more expensive for web crawlers at scale since it&#x27;s not as simple as just parsing a document. Forcing everything into a cheaply parseable document is just Google externalizing their costs on the rest of society.<p>Every decision made for blink needs two be viewed with two lenses: (1) what does this change mean for the Chrome web browser?; and (2) what does this change mean for the Google web crawler?

It&#x27;s probably a lot easier to pull the drivetrain out, swap in a known good one, and have the customer on their way than spend hours and days trying to debug the unit in the car (and potentially having the customer back again if the issue isn&#x27;t resolved).",1408136586

A relatively innocent and good-natured Bank lends a jerk $1.00<p>2. The jerk refuses to pay it back, <i>knowing</i> the bank can&#x27;t transfer it to someone who isn&#x27;t a pushover without giving him a steeply-discounted offer first<p>3. In response all loan requirements and interest rates rise for everybody<p>Secondly, it fucks up the negotiations, because would-be buyers can infer something when the creditor doesn&#x27;t snap up their own debt:<p>1. The Bank offers the debt for $0.10<p>2. The debtor <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> repay because he legitimately can&#x27;t scrape up that much<p>3. The Bank offers the debt for $0.10, but <i>nobody</i> wants to buy it, because they can infer that the debtor has nothing<p>4. The Bank offers the debt for $0.09... (begin loop)<p>Thirdly, it&#x27;s a logistical nightmare. The Bank can&#x27;t just combine the debt of it&#x27;s 1000 deadbeat debtors and sell it off to a debt collection agency for a lump sum. No, it needs to send 1000 mailing notifications and 1000 second-notifications and wait 30 days, etc...

Suppose the Bank barters your debt to a collection agency for a thing (like privately-held stock) in the collection agency? You can&#x27;t buy your debt because you can&#x27;t provide what the Bank is looking for...

The police took the serial number and details, and added it to a list they circulated to second-hand/pawn shops; this is checked when big-ticket items are brought in. It was (apparently) also used for searching websites like Craigslist to look for distinguishing features in similar devices sold locally. Pretty cool overall.<p>So it works in this sense, and while I really like the idea you&#x27;re talking about, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll work for a few of reasons:<p>1. This is apparently already happening (albeit behind the scenes, and probably only in some areas)\n2.

Eg. for many online image viewers (most &quot;gallery&quot; plugins), if you click &quot;NEXT NEXT NEXT&quot; quickly, the browser eventually just shows the spinning throbber and not the image because it&#x27;s busy downloading the high-quality version of the image several clicks back and i have to wait to catch up.

To follow up a scientist might say - ok lets look as people who eat basically nothing but saturated fat and people who eat basically none and see if one group drops dead quicker. This has been done, for example traditional eskimos live basically on saturated fat from the seal like stuff they eat and their health is fine. On the other hand some stuff like man made trans fats do kill you in a measurable manner - use them as your main diet and you&#x27;ll drop some years earlier which is why they are being banned - eventually after many years of such evidence.

7693921,comment,7692881,7693285,5,0,calpaterson,,,"Well, be specific about what indexing is: it layers a B-tree on top of what programmers would think of as an array structure.  Indexes are not just something which is always faster than a sequential scan in exchange for slightly slower writes - there are important cases where the index is slower than just doing a sequential scan.  Obviously you hope the query planner will avoid using an index in these cases, but the important thing to bear in mind is that indexes are not magic go-faster stripes :)<p>The problem happens when this B-tree is too large to fit into your working memory: swapping parts of the B-tree in and out of memory repeatedly to answer a query is very slow.  The solution that partitioning offers is to allow you to split your indexes (and your data) so that, depending on your access-patterns you could see less swapping of that index.",1399202636

Unfortunately, the way things were arranged meant that opting for the IA track in Grade 9 pretty much meant giving up university as an option since you&#x27;d have to give up the credits in things like history, geography and CanLit that were required at the grade 9 and 10 level for an OSSHGD (Grade 13 diploma).

119384,comment,119214,119372,0,0,bokonist,,,"I mostly agree.  I never did math the traditional paper and pencil way; I always used various short cuts to do mental math.  Schools are leading kids down the wrong path teaching the traditional carrying-the-one approach.  Nobody does that in real life. I do think though, that having command of the multiplication tables is extremely important, because it makes  all future math so much easier.",1203475047

Effectively, the author predicted some of the things you mention, and probably a lot of things that haven't happened yet.",1203474948

119377,comment,119344,119344,0,0,brk,,,"Interesting, and we've all heard this thing about whoever says a number first loses.<p>Having been on the hiring and hiree side of the table, I don't think this is as universally true as people make it out to be.  I've both paid more than budgeted, and been paid more than the budget, on several occasions when it seemed the ""fit"" was right.<p>I usually try to get a feel for the salary range, the phase of the company (pre-launch, post-launch but small sales, sales flowing, etc.), and the overall position.  If I can get the company (or candidate) to offer a number first, that's great.  If not, so be it.  I think that more often than not I've told candidates what the salary is for a position before they've asked.  If they would've worked for less, oh well, I'd rather compensate all members of my team fairly... employees that got the salary shaft soon find out and become bitter.  If they wanted more, they can reconsider or negotiate.  It matters little to me when I'm in the hiring position.",1203474009

119372,comment,119214,119214,0,0,randrews,,,"I can see what the textbook authors intended here, I think. There's not a whole lot of point to memorizing multiplication tables, it's much more useful to be able to work out arithmetic in your head. The way described here (going to multiples of ten and adding) is pretty close to the way I do it (going to prime factors and then multiplying back). Probably the authors wanted to teach what my grade school teachers called ""mental math"", which sounds like a worthy goal to me.<p>What's impossible to tell without looking at the textbook is, are the parents resisting because they equate math with memorization, or because the textbook fails to teach ""mental math""? The article is slanted a bit toward the latter, and I was looking forward to reading it and laughing at the dumb textbook writers along with it, but I'm not so sure.<p>I love the picture on the article, also. The kid, sort of dopey and puzzled-looking, and the father, with the sad look on his face, far in the background, out of focus, powerless to help... It's perfect.",1203473611

If you focus on the reward... (procrastination) If you focus on the process, you'll get there""<p>Litman quotes Bloomberg...<p>From page 52 (paperback) in his book 'Bloomberg By Bloomberg':<p>""We made mistakes, of course. Most of them were omissions we didn't think of when we initially wrote the software. We fixed them by doing it over and over, again and again. We do the same today. While our competitors are still sucking their thumbs trying to make the design perfect, we're already on prototype version No. 5.<p>By the time our rivals are ready with wires and screws, we are on version No. 10. It gets back to planning versus acting. We act from day one; others plan how to plan - for months.""<p>The principle is fundamental. I don't think it was a specific book. I'm on his email list twice - he reiterates the theme a lot.<p>To elaborate, Litman says it's all about small steps. You need to make a commitment to taking small steps. All of successful business is a compilation of small victories. It's the small steps that make a difference. Most people aren't willing to stay in the game long enough to succeed...<p>Conversations with Millionaires is a great book because he interviews a really diverse group of successful entrepreneurs.<p>Personally, I don't always like his rah-rah cheerleading you-can-do-it approach but he shares some valuable insights.",1203473563

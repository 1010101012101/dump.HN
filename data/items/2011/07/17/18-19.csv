Shall I just ignore this and refuse to be terrorized?<p>The idea isn't to shrug off what you perceive to be dangerous situations. The recent attempts at US attacks were thwarted because people were correctly suspicious. Level of suspicion also depends on where you're at. In your second instance with the coffee shop, if I'm in Vancouver, Canada I'd think ""He probably just forgot it, I should go after him."" If I'm in London, then yeah, I'd probably be suspicious since from my perspective there seem to be a lot more successful attacks there.<p>The idea is in how you respond to those sorts of things. Do you really consider the plane scenario a strong possibility for you, with the guy actually carrying a bomb? If you do, that shows two things. One, you're (statistically) over-paranoid and have been ""terrorized"". Two, you've basically admitted that you think all the current security measures designed to make you feel safer are basically crap, in which case you should agree with removing them and potentially designing better methods that actually work.",1310927849

Commonly misread words could easily inflate scores.<p>However, I think a multiple choice test could also inflate scores unless the definitions were very cunningly constructed.<p>I scored 75-80th percentile (32,800) which surprised me. It seems quite a lot of words, for one. For another I consider my vocab' to be very good and I don't think I'm being bigheaded in that. Ergo I expected to be ranked higher.<p>On the second page there was an entire column of words of which I recognised only three sufficiently to provide a guaranteed accurate definition. One of that column was terpischorean, another tatterdemalion.<p>Whilst looking up tatterdemalion I found little use of it after the 1930s except as a proper noun (a Marvel Comics character for example).

2773789,comment,2773426,2773426,66,0,acabal,,,"Good article but it'll never be read by those who need to read it most.<p>Unfortunately terror has now been institutionalized.  The TSA is a massive bureaucracy that generates jobs and cash flow.  It's not something that will ever be dismantled overnight.  That's not even mentioning the political convenience it provides: with it politicians can keep us afraid, thus getting our votes when they promise to protect us.<p>It goes deeper than just fear of terrorism though.  Having spent the last few years traveling the world and seeing how other people live, it's always shocking to return to the States to see how afraid everybody is of even the smallest things.  Fear seems to have become a centerpiece in the American psyche, and long before 9/11.  We even raise our kids to be afraid (see some of the vitriolic responses freerangekids.wordpress.com gets in response to advice like, ""It's OK to let your kid ride the bus alone"").  Fear of mundane things giving you cancer; existential fear about the economy, which many of us don't even understand and as individuals, have no control over; fear of walking the streets alone at night; fear of getting sick if we don't use antibacterial soap after each bathroom trip.  Fear of someone spiking your Tylenol.  Uncontrollable fear of a country across the ocean maybe having WMD's.<p>No, fear of terrorism is just the latest in a laundry list of things Americans have scared themselves with.  Until we learn to control that basic fear response, the TSA will still be around and people will still be scared of sitting next to a dark-skinned man kneeling in prayer.",1310925831

[1]<p>With regards to scripting, since perl/python/ruby has supplanted shell for moderate to difficult tasks, I think it's perfectly reasonable to use bash/zsh for the occasional simple shell script. Arch Linux, for example, writes rc scripts in modern bash, significantly increasing legibility (given you can read modern bash).<p>Even if you stick to sh for maximum portability, if you use bash/zsh as an interactive shell, I would strongly encourage diving into the man page; modern shells, for all their shell\ quoting woes, have an amazing amount of concise constructs that make life at the command line quite pleasurable.<p>[1]: More likely is that Korn shell is the inspiration for both",1310925814

They completely missed that the point of the triangular notepad is that it unfolds. That implies they didn't look at the article, because it has a picture of the triangular notepad doing that.",1310925761

By asking me to ""Like"" your facebook page and follow you on Twitter, you end up losing more than you could have potentially gained. I'm very supportive of projects which I believe are interesting and helpful to my followers and will add them willingly to my incoming content. If you coerce me into it before deciding that on my own, individuals (like myself) will use other factors to decide if they will take your desired action (like your request = pushy; or our past relationship = n/a).<p>If you want people to take your desired action that will affect them long term (like including your project in my twitter feed), give them some incentive! ;)<p>I also do not have an iPhone to test your idea with, unfortunately. And your blog link at the bottom of the page doesn't work yet. Also, I think your homepage is somewhat misleading. Even if you're trying to be funny, your mentions of high profile blogs and quotes of yourself may be more harmful than humorous.",1310925642

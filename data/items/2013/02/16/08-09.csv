Also, self-critical language like ""fallen short of [our] promise"" and ""we failed to..."" is a de facto apology and acceptance of responsibility even when the word 'sorry' only appeared earlier.<p>I can understand how this developed. Things worked well for most customers. Many of those with problems got them under control with more dynos or multi-worker setups. Heroku's Rails roots biased them towards a ""keep it simple, throw hardware at it, or look for optimizations in the app/sql/db"" mindset. Well, many of their Rails/Bamboo customers complaining about latency, even in the presence of this growing issue, may have also (or even primarily) had other app issues too. (When supporting developers, especially many beginning/free-plan developers, it doesn't take long for your conditional probability P((we have a real problem)|(customer thinks we have a problem)) to go very low, and P((customer app has a problem)|(customer thinks we have a problem)) to go very high.)<p>Even when Heroku had a unitary (and thus 'smart') router, they surely got latency complaints that were completely due to customer app issues or under-provisioning, so they stuck with the 'optimize app or throw dynos at it' recommendation for too long. And, when they habitually threw more hardware at the Bamboo routing mesh, they were unwittingly making the pile-up issues for Bamboo web dynos worse. Some key data about the uneven pre-accept queueing at dynos was missing, which combined with habits of thought that had worked so far gave them a blind spot.<p>Despite the growing issue, adding dynos at the margin would still always help (at least a little)  as well as adding to Heroku revenues. Even without any nefarious intent, a 'problem' that fits neatly into your self-conception (""we give people the dyno knob to handle any scaling issues and it works""), and is also correlated with rising business, may not be recognized promptly. That's just a natural human biased-perception issue, not incompetence or dishonesty.",1361004209

Below is the full unedited text of <a href=""https://help.heroku.com/tickets/37665"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.heroku.com/tickets/37665</a>, a Heroku support ticket I logged about 1 year ago. Sorry it is so long, but I think you'll find it interesting:<p>Tom@Rapgenius| about 1 year ago\nI know this is a bit of a vague problem, but I've been getting a bunch of Error H12 (Request Timeout)s recently, and I'm not sure what to do about it.\nIt's not like I have some particularly slow actions; I'm getting this error for actions that under most circumstances work totally fine (i.e., return in less than 300ms). Also I don't have a deep request queue (I'm running 40 dynos which is more than enough). Maybe I'm doing some slow queries? Should I upgrade my DB?\nAlso, I do notice that most of my app's time (according to New Relic) is being spent in Ruby (<a href=""http://cl.ly/29132F272W2D0K1l2I3P"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/29132F272W2D0K1l2I3P</a>). Would upgrading Ruby to 1.9 noticeably help this performance? (I'm a bit nervous it'll create a ton of problems).<p>Phil@Heroku\nHello - I can look into this, but I'll need access to your New Relic account. Will you make sure 'phil@heroku.com' has access?\nAlso, from your screenshot I notice your DB times are ~ 100 ms. We recommend keeping those times closer to 50 ms. You might be able to speed things up with a database upgrade.\nI'll look into New Relic once I have access and let you know what I find.<p>Tom@Rapgenius\nThanks, Phil!\nHow do I give you access to my New Relic account? I tried clicking ""account settings"" and got this: <a href=""http://cl.ly/0V2J3i0826400I2s3b2c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/0V2J3i0826400I2s3b2c</a><p>Phil@Heroku\nTom, I have access now. I'm not sure what was blocking me earlier.\nAfter looking at New Relic and the database server, I think a larger database will help. At the very least, it will be helpful to try the next level for a week and compare performance statistics in New Relic with the prior week.\nYour app is using an Ika right now, and the next step up is the Zilla database. We've made the upgrade process very simple, and it's outlined here - <a href=""http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/fast-database-changeovers?preview=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/fast-database-changeove...</a>\nYour database is ~ 5.4 GB in size (via the 'heroku pg:info' command) so an upgrade shouldn't take too long. You will be able to test the process by adding a Follower and timing it via the 'heroku pg:wait' command. This should give you a good idea of how long it will take to spin up the new database. Also, should the Zilla not help much, the downgrade process to an Ika will be the same. You only pay for the resources used.<p>The current database server appears to be a bit under-powered when it comes to Compute Units. The Zilla has more power and should provide some room to grow.\nAs for an upgrade to Ruby 1.9.2, I'm not sure how much that would help. It would be an involved upgrade that would take time to plan and deploy. The database upgrade should be a quicker solution.\nLong-term you may want to consider moving to the Cedar stack and Ruby 1.9.2.<p>Tom@Rapgenius\nThanks! I'm upgrading now<p>Tom@Rapgenius\nI'm still getting a ton of ""Request Timeout"" errors. E.g.:\n2011-12-08 14:46:53.222 219 1 2011-12-08T14:46:53+00:00 d. heroku router - - Error H12 (Request timeout) -> GET rapgenius.com/Wale-ambition-lyrics dyno=web.17 queue= wait= service=30000ms status=503 bytes=0\none weird thing: there aren't any values listed for the ""queue"" and ""wait"" parameters. Could that indicate a problem?\nCould an exception have been thrown earlier in the request before the timeout? Or does the timeout error just indicate that the request took too long? If it's the latter I'm not sure how to troubleshoot all these errors since the associated actions are fast the vast majority of the time<p>Tom@Rapgenius\nHere's another interesting example:<p>2011-12-08 15:59:32.293 222 1 2011-12-08T15:59:32+00:00 d. heroku router - - Error H12 (Request timeout) -> GET rapgenius.com/static/templates_for_js dyno=web.17 queue= wait= service=30000ms status=503 bytes=0\nThis action is extremely simple  it doesn't access the DB or any external services.

Can we let the site run through the weekend and see how things look Monday after 3 days of New Relic data with the new Zilla?<p>Tom@Rapgenius\n> It's possible for H12s to occur even for simple actions if there is already queueing for the app.<p>I feel what you're saying, but I don't think my app's queuing. For one thing, New Relic shows 0 time spent in the queue during the period in which I'm getting all these timeouts. For another, I'm running 40 dynos and my average request time is <400ms. So:<p>400 ms * 3000 requests / minute * 1 min / 60000 ms = 20 simultaneous requests (i.e., 20 dynos)\nso 40 dynos should definitely be more than enough.<p>Also, shouldn't Heroku be showing me the queue / wait stats at the time of the timeout? That would help prove whether my app was queuing at the time in question<p>It looks like New Relic has not reported any downtime over the past 24 hours.<p>New Relic isn't great at catching intermittent problems like this; you really feel it when you're using the site continuously for an hour or whatever. Also, users make many more HTTP requests than New Relic (since every page load kicks off several AJAX requests).<p>That said, there has been downtime in the past 24 hours (though less than in the previous 24): <a href=""http://cl.ly/3D2b1Z170B0w1f1m113m"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/3D2b1Z170B0w1f1m113m</a><p>Tom@Rapgenius\nHere's some additional data: At 5am this morning (EST), Rap Genius went down. I woke up at 11am (it's a Saturday!), did a logs --tail and observed that basically every request was timing out. I did heroku restart, and now every request started returning a backlog too deep error<p>Finally, I added another 10 dynos (bumping the total to 50, which is a log of dynos!), and this seems to have fixed the problem  perhaps because my app needs the additional capacity, or perhaps because merely changing the number of dynos reset something else. Either way, I'm sticking with 50 dynos for now out of fear even though I doubt my app needs that many (right?)<p>Either way, the 5 hours of unexplained downtime (there weren't any application-level exceptions or anything) that was fixable by tweaking my dyno count further supports my theory that something's going on with my app on Heroku's end.<p>Phil@Rapgenius\nTom -\nI've been looking over your New Relic stats.<p>First - the good news - the upgrade to a Zilla seems to have helped. Database times are down a bit, which can only help. I checked the actual database server and it's not showing signs of over-work like the previous Ika was.\nSecond, I notice that downtimes reported by New Relic over the past two weeks are in the early morning hours - 3 to 6 AM PST. Do you have any scheduled tasks that run during these times?<p>Also, request queueing is nearly zero, so 50 dynos does seem like a lot.\nWhat are your usage patterns like? The RPM graph in New Relic indicates the normal cyclical usage pattern, lower during the night, but what does Google Analytics tell you?<p>Finally, the Heroku platform has been having issues over the past week, but none of them correspond to the downtime you had Saturday morning.",1361003825

On our own, we did a huge amount of work to make things as fast as possible. While the H12's have gotten better, nothing has gotten rid of them completely. It really points to something fundamentally wrong with the routing layer because at some level we just can't optimize our code any further. There is definitely quite a few times in the logging where we just can't explain how things are insanely slow and we certainly can't explain why we get H12 errors anymore.

The meteor falls down, encountering gradually thicker air, heating up and heating up, until finally, the pressure and differential internal stresses are sufficient to separate it into smaller pieces.<p>These smaller pieces are a lot less massive per surface area, so the pressure acting on them is going to be a lot more relative to their mass, and they are going to slow down much faster.  The deceleration while this is going on, then, is going to induce sufficient turbulence to break them up even faster.  So the breakup occurs in a sort of chain reaction, and the pressure waves from nearby fragments influence each other, adding turbulence and slowing the cloud of fragments further, until it all ends up as small particles spread over a large area.  These particles are moving for the first fraction of a second of their life at supersonic velocities, generating a very large pocket of vacuum / shockwave as they dissipate their energies.  The rapid expansion of the largest highly vulnerable layer of the asteroid into a cloud of dust thus constitutes an 'explosion', even if the energy is all kinetic instead of the slow chemical burning that happens afterwards as the white-hot particles oxidise & turn to ash.<p>Asteroids are not uniform, however.  Wrap a chunk of granite in a chunk of sandstone, and you may end up chipping off bits of the sandstone for 10s, heating up until all the white-hot sandstone flies off in fragments at once for 2s, and then the granite flying further towards the ground until its yield strength is exceeded in a higher pressure regime, or it impacts the ground.  With complex structures, multiple waves of fragmentation are possible, and rather than being a simple matter of the fragments immediately dissipating into small particles and a harder core, a meteor will tend to split into chunks which themselves become smaller examples of this phenomena.",1361003148

The gun-enthusiast response to the penetration concern is either to ignore it and emphasize aim & intelligent planning, or to create expensive 45ACP 'frangible rounds' that shatter into a granular powder on impact.  There also exist somewhat anomalous theories about buckshot/birdshot being safer.<p>The most common guns, though, are lightweight, low-recoil 22LR-caliber pistols that lower the kill probability significantly over any of the more serious pistol rounds.<p>One can certainly create less-lethal loadings, either with traditional lead or something else like rocksalt shotshells, but things that can penetrate a chest cavity tend to be able to penetrate drywall.<p>I'd just go with a Taser and pepper spray if I was concerned about the small chance that penetrative shrapnel ends up energetic enough to hurt a loved one.",1361001723

6531099,comment,6528733,6530935,3,0,jonchang,,,"So is that the point you were originally trying to make instead of discussing etymology? While we&#x27;re quibbling prescriptively about terminology, I&#x27;d argue that the IE exploit patched earlier this week was in fact a zero day since it was not public knowledge.<p>> The vulnerability underlying CVE-2013-3897 was found internally at Microsoft and would have been fixed in MS13-080. However, in the last two weeks, attacks against the same vulnerability became public, but since the fix was in the code already, it enabled Microsoft to address the vulnerability, CVE-2013-3897, in record time.<p><a href=""https://community.qualys.com/blogs/laws-of-vulnerabilities/2013/10/08/patch-tuesday-october-2013"" rel=""nofollow"">https://community.qualys.com/blogs/laws-of-vulnerabilities/2...</a> (unnecessary text omitted)",1381456745
6531098,comment,6520308,6530682,1,0,LekkoscPiwa,,,"> Economics is a science.<p>Alright, I can use your semantics. Espeically because calling economics science is what we all do.<p>But it still doesn&#x27;t change the very valid point that Nobel Prize image may loose because of Economics Nobel Price.<p>The same way it wouldn&#x27;t be good for them to have Nobel Prize in Psychology. Or Political Science.<p>Top experts in these - forgive me the quotes - &quot;sciences&quot; can&#x27;t agree on even most basic and fundamental concepts in their &quot;sciences&quot;.<p>You&#x27;ll have keynsians who say you need to print in the crisis. And you&#x27;ll have austrains claiming that&#x27;s actually the worst thing you can do. One group calling other pseudo-science and the latter calling former marxist definitely doesn&#x27;t help its image. Propagating this image to the Nobel Prize isn&#x27;t not good for Novbel Prize. The claim is 100% valid in my book. I&#x27;m not surprised they don&#x27;t want to have it. It hurts their business.<p>Going back to Krugman in one of his &quot;brilliant&quot; pieces he suggests World War 3 is needed to end the crisis. Of course with austrains claiming that this is even worse and will make the crisis worse.<p>For a person on a street this looks like a band of clowns arguing. It&#x27;s not like Nobel Prize winners in Physics have arguments about value of number pi or there are some who think that Earth rotates the Sun and some other who <i>believe</i> (yep, science - believe, lol) the opposite is true. You see, all I&#x27;m saying is, that it is 100% understandable for some of the Nobel family to be disgusted with it and not wanting their Nobel Prize to suffer from that. What&#x27;s so difficult about understanding that?<p>Expanding on that thought: just imagine we have year 1490 and we don&#x27;t know any better. Let&#x27;s say a Nobel Prize in Physics exists. Let&#x27;s say that for whatever reason a scientist who believes that Sun goes around the Earth gets it. While guys who say that Earth goes around Sun are ridiculed and laughed at. Maybe Nobel Family members not being experts in economics just - rightly - are afraid that we&#x27;ll get better, much better in Economics in the future and then the Nobel Prize image will suffer. Because they are giving it out currently to some clowns, not even knowing about it. That&#x27;s their perspective and I think I agree with it. Wouldn&#x27;t you?",1381456681

It&#x27;s one of the most frustrating things about living in San Francisco, especially if you&#x27;re moving from somewhere bigger or more interesting.  However, NYC transplants to SF are rare; instead, you&#x27;ll find hundreds of people from small towns across the country and world who must assume all &quot;big&quot; cities (something SF barely qualifies as) are flush with urine smells, mentally ill homeless, an embarrassing public transportation system which barely runs and a terrible male-to-female ratio that reinforces the awkward social climate.",1381456346

You might get a model.  Your model might be consistent, but the model is never guaranteed to be true or be anything better than lucky.<p>Study some Daoism, Socrates, decideability, and other such intellectual resources regarding perception, conditional existence, and the possibility of solutions.<p>I get a high state of spirit from attacking whatever is in front of me.  My progress begets progress.  If I don&#x27;t have progress, I start.  Convolution of the topic of motivation is basically procrastination unless what you&#x27;re doing is not leading you even on a meandering path to your goal, in which case you need more goals and to be involved in activities with more potential.  I work on FOSS, maintain and develop FOSS, help users with the FOSS I work on, and there&#x27;s no doubt that it pays off, monetarily and in terms of potential.  Therefore, I am never in contact with this problem.  I&#x27;ve worked dead-end jobs to get into financial and skill position to work high-potential jobs.  Any time I&#x27;m not in such a position, I seek ways to get into such a position.  The problem of motivation is rhetorical.  Expecting an answer might give you one, but the existence of a problem or a solution to something that is axiomatic is a dead-end unless you get lucky and something totally outside your perception leads you to believe that you have a solution and a problem and that the two together have given you motivation.",1381456011

Yes, use GitHub or one of the SVN hosts to store the code. Emailing a zip file is way to difficult to manage.<p>b.) Hosting: Heroku is an option.

I live in Syracuse, NY and regardless of destination all of my traffic is routed over TWC&#x27;s network until it reaches Chicago. Upon reaching TWC&#x27;s infrastructure in Chicago my traffic can be handed off to Cogent, Level3, Telia, etc or continue on TW&#x27;s network. Or as luck would have it can be handed off to the HE POP in the same data center as the first hop in Chicago. Traffic that goes through the HE node has lower latencies and higher overall throughput. This is not just a general impression or anecdotal wget -4/-6 benchmarks. I have a local stratum one ntp server (GPS+PPS) for stability/robustness (and because I was interested in the overhead of the tunnel) the machine is configured to query a number of dual homed S1 ntp servers.

As there is a (fluent, but still) correlation between money and material goods, it&#x27;s not the same to be able to save 5% of 20K a year, and 5% of 200K.<p>One way I like to look at it, is how long would you have to save up to have 20xmedian (net) yearly income in your area in the bank? That is, after subtracting whatever reasonable living expenses, how long would you have to save all that&#x27;s left to have 20 yearly incomes in savings? Because at that point, barring financial crisis -- you should be able to live off the interests -- at roughly median income.<p>It&#x27;s actually a pretty small number -- the point at which you could reasonably retire just on your own savings pretty much indefinitely.<p>But it&#x27;s something that is generally impossible to do unless you are &quot;well off&quot; -- and not at the bottom of the pile, so to speak. On the other hand, as soon as you start making &quot;real&quot; money (say 1.2x median income) it becomes almost trivial if you deem it to be a goal worth trying for.",1381454000

Now that smart consumers can bypass the distributor in a lot of markets, the consumer becomes &quot;too powerful&quot; and capable of making decisions that subvert macro economic controls needed to keep control of the direction and pace of technology and other development.<p>Before you know it, you&#x27;ll be buying mini reactors for your house on Silk Road 2.0.

6530939,comment,6528900,6529750,5,0,jonnathanson,,,"G.K. Chesterton is one of the most under-appreciated wits and writers of the last few centuries. And he makes some great points about the &quot;self-help&quot; genre in that excerpt. But he&#x27;s also being a little glib here, and we risk losing some of that nuance when we just repost his excerpt.<p>Is 99.99% of the self-help industry bullshit? Probably. No, let&#x27;s go even further: almost assuredly. And to Chesterton&#x27;s point: even the authors who <i>aren&#x27;t</i> bullshitting us might be drawing upon very personal experiences and idiosyncratic circumstances that we can&#x27;t replicate. So be it. But here&#x27;s the thing: nobody&#x27;s ever gotten massively successful at any endeavor, skill, or enterprise without trying. If nothing else, books like Jason&#x27;s may provide a boost of motivation and a wake-up splash of cold water (literally or figuratively) to those of us who&#x27;ve temporarily lost our paths or our focus. And if it does that for even one reader, it&#x27;s served its purpose.<p>I don&#x27;t get the impression that Jason is selling snake oil or magic checklists here. I <i>do</i> get the impression that his book could probably be summed up in a few sentences, and one of those sentences is probably &quot;Get off your ass!&quot; But a lot of people could benefit from hearing that. I know I could from time to time. I spend a heck of a lot of time writing on HN, daydreaming, and putting my biggest ambitions on hold. If this book slaps me across the face and tells me to get my shit together, so be it. Maybe I&#x27;m the kind of person who needs to pay $8 to learn that lesson -- and if so, $8 is pretty cheap compared to the opportunity cost of never learning it, or of allowing myself to forget it.<p>To Chesterton&#x27;s point, no book about success is ever going to tell us how to be successful. But books that motivate us, that provide us interesting skills, and that -- if nothing else -- remind us to stay hungry and buckle down, can tell us why we&#x27;re <i>not</i> as successful as we want to be. From there, it&#x27;s up to us to figure out what to do about it.<p>Publishing magnate Felix Dennis wrote a really interesting self-help book, cheekily titled <i>How to Get Rich</i>. The book is essentially a very long-winded way of saying that what worked for Felix Dennis worked for Felix Dennis, and it probably won&#x27;t work for you -- but, as he puts it, and as I&#x27;ll paraphrase, &#x27;Nobody ever became extremely rich without <i>wanting</i> to be extremely rich.&#x27; And by that he means, becoming extremely rich (or successful by any other metric) has to become a laser-guided focus, to the exclusion of all else. It&#x27;s a very difficult choice people have to make, and in fact, Dennis argues that it&#x27;s the <i>wrong</i> choice for most people. Regardless, we need to be cognizant of our choices on a daily and even hourly basis, and that&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> easier said than done.",1381453225

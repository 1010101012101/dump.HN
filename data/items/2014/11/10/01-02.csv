Ihave to agree with the other commenters here. We all know JavaScript isn&#x27;t OO. I just wish OO programers would stop trying to force their concepts and patterns on it. It makes maintenance a nightmare for those who didn&#x27;t write it and didn&#x27;t code Java/C#/Lisp or whatever OO language their concept originated in before picking up JavaScript.",1415584793
8581685,comment,8580394,8580466,0,0,hkmurakami,,,"I have a strong conviction that out of all the professional postgraduate degrees out there, a MBA is the most &quot;rational&quot; for people to obtain for financial and professional progress purposes. Thus the cohort it attracts are hyperrational people (which is partly why I think &quot;most&quot; -- not all -- MBA graduates are ill-suited for starting companies, since a startup is a highly irrational affair from a financial perspective), and thus their decision making will be rational. It just makes sense to pursue a career in finance. After all, it <i>is</i> by far the most lucrative path on average.<p>Also, I can&#x27;t shake the suspicion that the output results from the program are affected significantly by the inputs (the students accepted by admissions), and the effect of the relative cyclical attractiveness of the industries must thus be attenuated significantly.",1415584586

I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s at all obvious.<p>Previous models for funding content are built around natural distribution barriers. E.g., it was hard making and getting books to people, so you used the distribution channel as the revenue channel. So I think most of our experience is like that.<p>But we now live in an age where distribution is effectively free. I just bought a book (yay, Ancillary Sword is out!). I paid for most of the distribution (I bought the tablet and pay for an Internet connection); the publisher, distributor, and retail channel together have a marginal cost measured in fractions of a cent. That changes things.<p>I think our closest historical example is broadcast radio and TV, which has never had a barrier to distribution. One way to fund that is ads, but there are others. For example, US public radio and the BBC produce a lot of high-quality, professionally-produced media and have for decades. Or we could look at newspaper serials, the format that gave us The Three Musketeers: newspapers print so many copies that sharing is easy; people paid because it was cheap and convenient.<p>But the interesting stuff is just getting started. Plenty of professional writers give a lot of stuff away for free on the web. I&#x27;ve helped fund a few different Kickstarter films, and would have been perfectly happy to throw in more if they had wanted to make the films available freely. Micropatronage is just getting going.",1415584284

8581664,comment,8580171,8581524,0,0,pron,,,"> This really irks me. Measuring and quantifying something is a prerequisite to optimizing it.<p>In <i>Notes from Underground</i> the hero attains his own measure of happiness through spite, i.e. self harm, i.e. misery. Any measure of human happiness is contradictory, or it wouldn&#x27;t be human. Try to imagine the most perfect utopia you can, where any measure you come up with is maximized, or optimized (to use the SV parlance). Then think if people would really be happy in such a place. Even if your measure includes just the &quot;right amount&quot; of misery, it would still be wrong, because, by virtue of its reality, it will no longer be optimal.<p>If I were pressed to come up with one ultimate measure for human happiness, it is this: people are happy when they have what they don&#x27;t have. Now optimize this. Of course, under this measure, people&#x27;s happiness is constant at zero, but there are other (smaller) terms in this formula that basically amount to <i>compromise</i> :)<p>I am sure you can appreciate the constant inner conflict of the human condition. Apparently you can&#x27;t measure soul.",1415584195

8581660,comment,8580171,8580171,0,0,johnloeber,,,"Even though some valuable ideas are expressed in this piece, there&#x27;s a lot of <i>conflation</i> of highly distinct social phenomena that goes on. The author looks at the notion of &quot;productivity&quot;, judges that people blindly rush from birth straight to the grave in the pursuit of being &quot;productive&quot;, somehow lops that in with GDPs (not per capita, not at PPP?) and the weird way in which we have industrialized pleasure, and concludes... what, exactly?<p>Regardless, the author expresses a valuable point that suffers from her conflating topics.<p>I think that point is that there&#x27;s a certain industrial culture -- a focus on productivity and structure -- that dominates our lives, whether in work or in leisure (see e.g. tourism). I don&#x27;t think this is necessarily bad, but it&#x27;s important to be aware of it.<p>Some people do indeed wear blinders as they race through life, being as productive as they can -- not for themselves, but maybe for society. Or for their boss. Or for someone else, whose interests are not necessarily aligned with their own. Maybe that&#x27;s a good reminder to carefully define productivity for yourself, however you see fit. The idea here is to have a notion of productivity to strive for that is well-aligned with doing things that make you <i>feel good</i> for the time invested. And then we&#x27;re right back down to those age-old platitudes, so obvious and ubiquitous that we forget their truth: &quot;spend your time wisely.&quot;",1415584128

The only hardcover of it I could find was from the Folio Society[1].  There may be paperbacks available from other publishers, I don&#x27;t know.<p>Folios are somewhat cheaper on the used market, and used copies of Folio Society books tend to be exceptionally well-kept, probably because they&#x27;re so pricey new.<p>As usual, most older (public domain) translations don&#x27;t have much going for them for a modern reader.  Several of the newer ones were OK, but Staniforth&#x27;s manages to hold very close to the original while remaining easy to read, besting most other translations on both fronts, IMO.<p>The Hays translation linked by the parent strays, to my eye, exceptionally far from the form of the Greek text, so if fidelity to the original is important to you I&#x27;d avoid it.<p>Hopefully that helps save someone the three or four hours I lost to this :-)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.foliosociety.com/book/MDS/meditations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.foliosociety.com/book/MDS/meditations</a>",1415584109

8581635,comment,8580949,8580949,0,0,sargun,,,"Differential Diagnosis is an excellent approach to debugging. Seeing debugging in the wild before, I&#x27;ve seen two, maybe three different approaches to debugging:<p>1) Magical thinking: This is the fear that the computer system has suddenly changed its mind and decided to stop working. The approach here is typically to try some cargo-cult knowledge on how to fix the system without knowing what&#x27;s wrong, and then just start hitting random things, and see if they come back.<p>2) Panic / Fixation: These kinds of developers usually get into a state where they are in a panic over what&#x27;s wrong and fixate on one component of the system where they believe the failure to be. This is slightly more productive than the earlier, but not changing your assessment based on the new information gained is also counterproductive.<p>3) DDX: This is very much the Sherlock / House type of debugging. It tends to require a lot of wide-shallow knowledge, as opposed to in depth knowledge of the system. Typically, you work backwards from the symptoms, and essentially do a binary search based on the widest type of problem sets to the narrowest.<p>DDX in-fact is very difficult for most people to do under stress. Nelson from Stripe wrote a post on keeping a notebook to store wide information, and enable caching b-tree searches.  This is a very good approach.",1415583583

It&#x27;s a Perl 6-invented character representation, designed to deal with un-precomposed graphemes properly.<p>* The Perl 6 C<Str> type, and more generally the C<Stringy> role, deals exclusively in NFG form.<p>* By default regexes operate on the grapheme (NFG) level, regardless of how the string itself is stored.<p>So, as far as graphemes (&quot;what a user thinks of as a character&quot;) are concerned, Perl 6 gets this basic aspect of text processing right when almost all others get it terribly wrong.<p>(There are a couple other langs that seem to have made an effort to take graphemes seriously enough. For example, the .length function for strings in Elixir (related to Erlang) returns the count of graphemes by default. And a few like Clojure take graphemes seriously, just not seriously enough.)<p>So, a significant and rapidly growing chunk of the planet&#x27;s programmer population are likely to end up interested in at least playing with P6 to see if it gets this bit right (and they&#x27;ll find it does).",1415583381

These days, I tend to approach a persistency implementation by asking myself:<p>* will it be read or write heavy?<p>* by what data/key will I access the persistent data?<p>Most commonly for the type of work that I do, it&#x27;s write once - read N number of times. What I end up doing then is just to keep the data in-mem in a hash table while writing it async to disk. Concurrent reads hit the hash table while the disk write is being performed. The file(s) are indexed by using a hash of the data itself, multiple ways to to lookups can also be done by using softlinks. Hashing lookup-keys are almost always prefered because of possible locale/security reasons (makes it harder for you to implement an accidental LFI if you only deal with base36) If needed and/or depending on access patterns, I also keep the N most accessed items in a hash table in-mem over time. The API for this usually ends up as two functions, Get and Put.<p>The amount of code for doing this is a couple of hundred lines at most and it&#x27;s complexity I&#x27;ve found by experience to be preferable to using a db for the type of work that I do.

I&#x27;m not sure. Is she against working hard? Maybe. Does she think it impossible to quantify happiness and well-being? I get the impression she does.<p>First, the author made a <i>huge</i> mistake when talking about GDP. Her comparison used absolute instead of per-capita values. India and Canada may produce the same amount of wealth, but India has 35 times more people. Of course per-capita GDP doesn&#x27;t fully capture quality of life, but it&#x27;s easy to measure and hard to fake. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s used.<p>Most people make mistakes when it comes to balancing work and leisure, but to claim such mistakes are killing us is preposterous. People in developed countries live the longest, healthiest lives in the history of humanity. The nation with the longest life expectancy is the workaholic Japanese culture so disparaged by the author!<p><i>Many people, especially in technology, say their productivity is changing the world, and this is irrefutable. But no one seems to know what they’re changing it into, because no one can measure the world. When no one can measure the world, how much can it really exist?</i><p>This really irks me. Measuring and quantifying something is a prerequisite to optimizing it. Maybe a lot of people are measuring the wrong things. Maybe they&#x27;re missing or underweighting a factor. Maybe they just have different preferences than the author.

Building AOL compatibility then meant a whole heck of a lot and it's taken more than a decade to get to some kind of interoperability.<p>I wish Skype had some sort of market share large enough to justify the FCC pushing Microsoft to do the same thing.

I've been reading HN for around 6 months and lots of people have been suggesting that content quality is falling recently and there've been a lot of meta discussions about it.  I think that the comments haven't degraded as much as people are claiming.  The posted articles and the post titles have however been taking a turn for the worse.  I agree with the parent: we don't need tags to indicate the category of the post.  That's just lazy.  What we need is just more honesty and less sensationalism in the wording of the titles.  Maybe pg could add a system wherein anyone can edit a title and others vote on it?  or perhaps foster a community where misleading titles are down voted?",1305547628

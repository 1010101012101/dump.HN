The laws of physics are not discovered by running experiments to enumerate every possible combination or permutation of configurations.<p><i>You're assuming an intact core. Criticality is a function of density, shape and temperature, in addition to mass.

Particularly the disaffected.<p>Racial homogeneity can only go so far to explain things, but Japan is a country where people generally look out for one another. When I was there, people were so polite that I thought these people were feigning politeness. I remembered walking out of a food stall when the head waiter would call out that a customer is leaving, and all the wait staff would turn around and bow and ask us to come again. It was simply amazing. I guess by learning to be polite even when you are tired, stressed, you become very good at being outwardly calm and it helps to maintain social order.<p>Incidentally, I remembered the caning incident where a young expat in Singapore spray painted cars and got several strokes of cane as a punishment.

This wil not change likely, it's sickness of the masses who are mostly not taking things responsible, some do but they get buried by this random nonsense.<p>Thats why I follow on Twitter maximum 50 people and only those who are focused on providing useful information and not whether they got drunk yesterday and today they woke up with huge headache.<p>Saying that you are sending prayers and light on twitter to people in need is just one big excuse for doing nothing and continuing with your breakfast while you feel good about yourself.",1300274452

Ignored partly because Unix isn't that conducive to it.<p>The Unix Way is to operate on lines of text with tools like sed/awk. These lines of text are poorly-serialized object representations.<p>Programs are big monolithic procedures (which take a lot of optional params as input — switches), which you're supposed to glue together under extremely weak programming environments (like bash).<p>I abuse Unix to get out of this paradigm as much as appropriate. There is a good idea hidden inside communicating with serialized objects (which I'm sure Erlang users understand better than I do), but it's a very primitive version.<p>(Maybe I'm wrong and someone will finally enlighten me.)",1300274168

3231149,comment,3229360,3229928,9,0,wormwood28,,,"""At the January 2000 Macworld in San Francisco, Jobs rolled out the new Macintosh operating system, OSX, which used some of the software that Apple had bought from NeXT three years earlier. It was fitting, and not entirely coincidental, that he was willing to incorporate himself back at Apple at the same moment as the NeXT OS was incorporated into Apples. Avie Tevanian had taken the UNIX-related Mach kernel of the NeXT operating system and turned it into the Mac OS kernel, known as Darwin. It offered protected memory, advanced networking, and preemptive multitasking. It was precisely what the Macintosh needed, and it would be the foundation of the Mac OS henceforth. Some critics, including Bill Gates, noted that Apple ended up not adopting the entire NeXT operating system. Theres some truth to that, because Apple decided not to leap into a completely new system but instead to evolve the existing one. Application software written for the old Macintosh system was generally compatible with or easy to port to the new one, and a Mac user who upgraded would notice a lot of new features but not a whole new interface.""<p>Isaacson, Walter (2011-10-24).

This makes their job challenging, but it also makes it rewarding in that you know when you've gotten it right, when that piece of work is done.<p>Project managers have a task much more like herding cats: a poorly (or non) defined problem, moving goalposts, and a lot of ""least worst compromise"" kind of decisions.

A lot of his tactics he takes right from Jobs, but for some reason his diction reminds me more of Scott Forstall, who's always a little more eager and a little more rehearsed than Jobs was on stage. (Jobs always took his time talking.) Not that this is a bad thing! When I was his age I was mimicking my favorite writers' styles, and teaching myself the comic pacings of my favorite comedians. That's how you first develop a sensibility, by studying the people you like.<p>He absolutely shows signs of nervousness  his movements are twitchy, he speaks too quickly and runs over his sentences. Clearly he spent a lot of time rehearsing what he had to say, and he does a good job of it. He gets the audience to laugh, though I'll be skeptical and suggest that audiences are predisposed to laugh at jokes made by young people, and also at jokes involving Justin Bieber getting whacked.<p>The reason I wouldn't call him great (though he is clearly good at this) is that he doesn't take his audience's perspective into account. I'd be stunned if he could; it's a damned difficult skill to have learned when you're a preteen. He takes (and sells) some effective cadences, but what he's actually saying fits awkwardly within the frame. He spends time explaining certain things unnecessarily, because from his younger perspective certain details are more interesting than they are when you're even a little bit older. Again, not surprising, and not a ding against him.<p>As for your Ray Allen quip, unfortunately I don't know basketball well enough to respond, but I argue that there's a difference between a basic action (like shooting a three-pointer) and a pattern (like constructing a speech in a certain way with certain rhythms). It would be like if a basketball player had a certain famous technique for making his way across the court once he had the ball. You could watch a younger player and notice that he was mimicking the tactics of certain players. Once again, not something to be held against a young person figuring out the rules of a game  that's one of the best ways to learn! But this kid is still sticking pretty rigorously to a template. It's a good template, and I think it's cute seeing a young kid mimic speakers with whom I'm quite familiar.<p>I just wouldn't call it great  because for me presentation is a nuanced art, and there's a lot more to it than what we're seeing here. Calling this great might close minds to the possibility of more sophisticated presentations, and that would be a real shame. It's nothing against this kid, who's clearly bright and having a lot of fun in the spotlight.",1321202681

How are they calculating the debt?<p>There are more subtle issues, too. Its very hard to know what to count as Irish sovereign debt. Do you count 'working capital' on loan from the ECB? How do you value the assets of the nationalised banks, which perhaps count against debt?  Also, adding to the confusion, is that countries have an incentive to use various accounting strategies to minimise the figures.<p>So its very hard to come up with an estimate that everyone agrees on.<p>One of the Irish economic commentators, generally thought to hold the most pessimistic outlook, is academic economist Morgan Kelly; he wrote an article in the Irish times, in May, where he estimated the debt at 250B euro (~$340B) (<a href=""http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2011/0507/1224296372123.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2011/0507/122429...</a> - pretty grim reading).\nObviously a terrible amount of debt, but its half the amount quoted in the NYT.<p>How did Ireland get like this?

This turned out to be a very bad decision.  Its also a decision that the ECB and other EU countries won't let Ireland wriggle out of, as many of the creditors of the Irish banking system are other EU financial institutions (worried about systemic risk) - to the extent that Ireland recently paid off a controversial unguaranteed bank loan, under pressure from the ECB.<p>So this is why the Irish sovereign debt is so high.<p>The fundamentals of the economy could have been better - there was too much building construction, for a start - but they weren't bad; the state functions, people pay their taxes, Irelands a good place to do business, and is becoming a very friendly place for startups; so the scenario is very different from Greece; but the level of debt is sadly huge.",1321200907

It never happened. Asked her to call a company to arrange the purchase & delivery of glass whiteboards. Never happened.<p>This is not hard stuff.<p>When my partner was VERY sick and yet we had a major server problem, and he went into the office to fix it -- telling them he was on his way -- both employees expressed anger at him for kicking them out after they had left the house & were on their way. (They didn't want to catch his virus.) This is despite the fact that this server problem meant <i>we weren't able to charge customers</i>. The most obnoxious one bitched later about the cleanliness of the office -- apparently my sick partner left Theraflu packets lying about in the kitchen.<p>She also made derogatory comments about the way I wrote the copy on the site, after I clearly told her it was a matter of branding.<p>When I held a meeting on ""how we could work together better,"" one of the employees had the gall to tell me ""Sometimes you hover."" This is the employee who failed to complete basic tasks. I told her, ""If I hover, it's because I don't feel like I know what's going on. You could give me more updates."" Of course, the real reason I hovered was because the work didn't get done. (And trust me, I didn't start off hovering -- I don't have the time and energy to waste on it, that's why I fired them.) I probably should have just reamed her out right then -- maybe that would have clarified things. But I don't think I should have to tell somebody something so obvious.<p>Naturally, when I would walk around our teeny tiny office, every time I went over to this employee's desk, she'd have Facebook up.<p>The few times the employees did come up with an idea, I praised them and told them to make it happen. We'd sit and make plans, I'd outline what I wanted to see, and when I wanted to see it, but ""somehow"" they never kept it up.<p>I'm sure I'm not the ideal boss. Obviously I spoiled them and led them to believe they were more important & more critical than they were. Nevertheless, I never yelled, never criticized in public, never did any number of ""bad boss"" things that might have actually gotten me what I wanted. I tried to accommodate them and be gentle. Instead, I had to fire them. Sad.",1321200188

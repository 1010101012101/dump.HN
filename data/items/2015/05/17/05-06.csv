Saying that you are willing to risk the lives of everyone on a plane, potentially killing all of them, just to demonstrate that it&#x27;s theoretically possible to bring a plane down, is akin to putting a washing machine on the railroad tracks, just to demonstrate it&#x27;s possible to de-rail a passenger train.<p>This is the sort of testing that should be done on planes <i>without</i> passengers.",1431842318

Sure, there are some benefits from having a few processes that are managing different parts of the system, but not hundreds of processes just for browsing. The way I use Firefox is that having 50 or more tabs open is normal for me, sometimes there are even hundreds of them. Currently Firefox works great and although there are some unresponsiveness during some workflows, they are not so annoying.<p>I am really worried about this change because I have used Firefox since its version 1.5 and am very familiar with all its problems and successes through the years.",1431842236

The suggestion is that you get better at setting deadlines.<p>You may be living and breathing your exciting project but, really, how many lives were saved by setting such an aggressive deadline?  How many businesses did you save from bankruptcy?  If your own, then you might want to think harder about saner financial planning as well.<p>Very few projects need to rush to the finish line to be successful.<p>You live and breathe an exciting project.  I get it.  But how is the quality of your thought process affected by pushing yourself to the limit everyday?  People need space to think.  People need space to see outside of their obsession.  Not allowing for that misses opportunities or, worse, puts you in a position to be surprised by something outside of that obsession.<p>The rest of us aren&#x27;t stupid.  Many of us are seasoned.  We realize that one must be wary of obsession because keeping your mind in one mode for too long makes it very hard to move from that mode or even eventually realize that other modes exist.  And, make no mistake, eventually reality will force a change.  The question is, will you be cultivating the flexibility to deal well with it or will you be stuck in one mode?<p>You&#x27;re running a marathon, not a sprint.

If he did then that would both be a gross lapse in basic aircraft security and he actually deserves some level of legal recourse for endangering other passenger&#x27;s life, as well as thanks for exposing the vulnerability.<p>I liken it to hacking into a car and causing the acceleration pedal to stick on momentarily when you change radio stations.

I agree it is a crucial factor, but we&#x27;re forced to wait for the truth to out. There are journalists who have already responded that they have some corroborating evidence:<p>* R J Hillhouse: <a href=""http://www.thespywhobilledme.com/the_spy_who_billed_me/2015/05/logic-escapes-the-press-i-did-not-accuse-hersh-of-plagiariam.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thespywhobilledme.com/the_spy_who_billed_me/2015/...</a>\n* Carlotta Gall: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/magazine/the-detail-in-seymour-hershs-bin-laden-story-that-rings-true.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/magazine/the-detail-in-sey...</a><p>> SEALs typically don&#x27;t need someone to lead them up a staircase.<p>This detail, even if incorrect or spun by ISI, doesn&#x27;t seem like a story killer.<p>> However, outside observers directly after the event showed that the place showed evidence of fighting on all floors.<p>Agree that there are several conflicting reports (both from the White House on different days, the SEALs themselves, and now Hersh) on the operational details of the mission.<p>Some accounts claim that the SEALs needed to breach their way in after the crash.<p>What you are saying would impact the credibility of the story if true. I haven&#x27;t been able to find any past references for that. Are you able to point me to an archive.org link please?<p>Note however that the operational details don&#x27;t necessarily reflect on the political details.<p>> Hersh clearly misrepresents Sec. Gates comments at one point...<p>I agree the context of the quote is confusing and perhaps misleading. It seems the source is making one set of claims, but Gates is saying something else in his memoir (‘Why doesn’t everybody just shut the fuck up?’).<p>The source&#x27;s claims are: 1) Gates was the only one actively protesting the announcements, 2) Gates objected to the idea of claiming that information was obtained by torture 3) Gates insisted that the agreements with Pakistan had to be honoured.<p>While you&#x27;re correct that the quote from Gates does not back up the source&#x27;s claim, it does not actually contradict it either.<p>Re: the drone attack wiping out evidence, the discussion is internal in October, they&#x27;re discussing what to <i>actually</i> do, versus what to tell the public. The context is quite different, but I agree it&#x27;s worth paying attention to.<p>> I do have hands on experience with contradicts another element of the story<p>Naturally I&#x27;m curious, but I understand if you are unable to provide any detail.<p>> The point is, this is not a criticism of Hersh per se, except in that he gives this one anonymous source too much credit.<p>I believe he claims two other US sources with corroborating information, &quot;longtime consultants to the Special Operations Command.&quot;.<p>> It just annoys me to see smart people believe something like this...<p>I certainly don&#x27;t <i>know</i> that the story is true, but there are a lot of problems with the official explanation. The obvious one is the White House claim that the SEALs managed to fly helicopters 90 minutes over a contested border - bear in mind someone in the neighbourhood tweeted to ask what was up with the helicopter noise and &quot;huge window shaking bang&quot;[1] - and spend 40 minutes shooting up a compound and blowing stuff up without any of the local military doing anything. From what I have read, there were two army bases within a couple of miles of there.<p>* <a href=""http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/social.media/05/02/osama.twitter.reports/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/social.media/05/02/osama.tw...</a><p>A great quote from Carlotta:<p>&quot;The local police told me that they received the calls and could have been at the compound within minutes, but army commanders ordered them to stand down and leave the response to the military. Yet despite being barracked nearby, members of the Pakistani Army appear to have arrived only after the SEALs — who spent 40 minutes on the ground without encountering any soldiers — left.&quot;",1431841810
9558880,comment,9557503,9558002,0,0,the_af,,,"I can only speak for Scala: it&#x27;s doing &quot;pretty well&quot;, but in some aspects it&#x27;s not doing as well as it could, were it a purely functional language.<p>Scala has a lot going for it, not the least its interoperability with Java. But being a hybrid language is not zero-cost: its type inference for example is less powerful than Haskell&#x27;s (it can infer fewer things; I&#x27;ve read this is because inheritance complicates things), and to me its type signatures are harder to read. Also, because pretty much every Scala function has &quot;purity escape hatches&quot; built-in, you can never be sure what does or doesn&#x27;t have side-effects. And this is unrelated to purity, but Scala&#x27;s null makes me sad.",1431841641

It is impossible to make imperative programming languages safer by only partially removing implicit side effects. Leaving one kind of effect is often enough to simulate the very effect you just tried to remove. On the other hand, allowing effects to be &quot;forgotten&quot; in a pure language also causes mayhem in its own way.<p>Unfortunately, there is no golden middle, and we are faced with a classic dichotomy: the curse of the excluded middle, which presents the choice of either (a) trying to tame effects using purity annotations, yet fully embracing the fact that your code is still fundamentally effectful; or (b) fully embracing purity by making all effects explicit in the type system and being pragmatic by introducing nonfunctions such as unsafePerformIO. The examples shown here are meant to convince language designers and developers to jump through the mirror and start looking more seriously at fundamentalist functional programming.&quot;</i>",1431841299

9558867,comment,9557727,9557836,0,0,StillBored,,,"Blah, most of the mainstream news pieces are simply regurgitation of press releases anyway (whitehouse or otherwise). Investigative journalism is dead because it was a cost center. Good interviewing is dead because interviewers are scared to death that they won&#x27;t get guests if they are seen as combative (aka ask hard questions). Even Charlie Rose seems to be tossing nothing but softballs for more than a decade. I stopped watching a few years ago because he stopped asking the questions that needed to be asked.<p>The perfect example of how broken the western media is can be seen on their treatment of the WMD in iraq claim, for which the US went to war, spent Billions and killed tens if not hundreds of thousands. When the question of WMD in Iraq comes up, its all about the CIA&#x27;s intelligence failures. But if you go rewatch the Colin Powell speech in front of the UN, its a joke. I remember watching it with a coworker, and we couldn&#x27;t believe that the best evidence of WMD in iraq was artist renderings of hearsay. Yet, the media took it all like it was ironclad with pictures of the actual weapons, chemical analysis of what they contained, and first person witnesses. Not a single first or second tier news organization called it for what it was, BS.<p>EDIT: I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is that if all the traditional news outlets disappear its not really any loss at this point. The loss has already happened, the news is just a hollow shell of its former self. Which is why twitter provides a replacement. If all you do is repeat press releases, then what matters is who gets it out first. Thoughtful analysis, filtering the BS, fact checking, etc were the value add. But its gone, so the news isn&#x27;t worth paying for. Those things were gone long before the internet started killing the zombies of the media.",1431841094

I don&#x27;t have a solid response to most of your questions. Tech salaries seem to be all over the place. I would say given our location, job requirements, and company culture the salary range we offer is very competitive. That hasn&#x27;t been an issue with anyone we&#x27;ve talked with yet. Being so close to SV does confuse things sometimes though.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I fully understand the difference between a job and a genuine opportunity. With a small team every member has a pretty large say in how things are done so everyone has the potential to really make a difference. It&#x27;s definitely more than just getting work put in front of you. On the money side this is a mature bootstrapped company, so someone looking to gamble on stock options probably wouldn&#x27;t be interested.<p>The area is generally pretty desirable. Beautiful surroundings, nice weather, lots of options for schools, interesting history, lots of great local food, relatively decent music scene, close to hiking, biking, skiing, rivers, and Tahoe. This is actually an area where a lot of tech people retire or semi-retire and open a satellite office. There&#x27;s a lot of cool tech history with the Atari 2600 and a lot of broadcast video equipment being invented here. Not nearly as much web or software history though.<p>I&#x27;ve had a lot of this on my mind but I don&#x27;t know I&#x27;ve done a very good job of communicating in any of our listings. We may try remote again, but will probably give local a little longer before we go that route. Thanks again, clearly this has me thinking and I&#x27;m hoping it will improve our future listings.",1431840348

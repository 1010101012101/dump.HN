2119299,comment,2118460,2118990,0,0,guynamedloren,,,"I agree that there is a huge responsibility placed on the shoulders of students, as there should be, but there is a deeper problem here.  Colleges should motivate students to inquire, to learn, and to challenge themselves.  While this motivation could definitely be indirect, it should still be one of the primary goals of educational institutions (not only universities, but schools of all shapes and sizes).<p>One of the best ways colleges could motivate students is by making sure the curriculum and corresponding coursework is up-to-date.  Now, it may have just been my department (enterprise systems engineering UIUC), but 99% of the material covered during my college career was extremely dated.  The 8th edition textbooks were almost identical to their 1st edition counterparts published 30+ years ago.  The homework assignments were re-used year after year (which made the acquiring the solutions ridiculously easy).  You have no idea how disheartening it is to walk into class every day or sit down to do homework knowing that you will never, ever in a million years use anything you are ""learning"".  It's not motivating.  It's not encouraging.  It's not challenging.<p>The 3.5 years I spent in college were, without a doubt, the worst years of my life.  I just graduated (early, thank god) and I feel like my brain clicked on for the first time since 2007.  Don't get me wrong - I am a huge fan of learning and critical-thinking (taught myself Ruby on Rails over the past few months with no prior programming experience), but it's pretty damn hard when you can get through one of the most prestigious engineering programs in the world on auto-pilot.",1295430730

2119297,comment,2118460,2118811,0,0,zerokyuu,,,"I don't know the actual statistics, but I heard that nearly everyone from my high school went to college after graduating.  Even though I got good grades, I was actually a bit of a slacker myself in high school; mostly because I did a lot of extra curricular activities (ice/roller hockey, drumline, cello, studied Japanese and computer stuff).  However, I heard somewhere that about 30% of the kids from my high school would drop out from college in their first two years.  This seems about right based on what I saw on Facebook.  Some of them were slackers, some of them must have had no interest in college and probably shouldn't have bothered going.<p>Anyway, I'm in grad school now, and I haven't noticed many slackers (maybe a grad student taking a weekend off?).  Although, I didn't really notice many slackers in college either.  That may be because I went to a research-focused University to study engineering.",1295430695

It's hard to compare them directly since RDS separates instance type, on-demand and reserved instances, provisioned storage, replication (crossing availability zone boundaries), and number of requests. Heroku on the other hand provides a fixed amount of storage (and one that's twice the max one can provision for RDS), a mix of instance types, and a connection cap limit. It's not clear if Heroku provides multiple availability zone instances similar to RDS.<p>Ignoring provisioned storage and request costs one can have a small on-demand RDS instance for ~$80/month. Heroku's instance (RAM/CPU) equivalent (Ronin) is $200/month.",1295428042

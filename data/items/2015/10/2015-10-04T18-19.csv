A &#x27;program&#x27; is basically a set of wires that connect blocks like oscillators, integrators, filters, etc... you started with some mathematical formula you wanted to solve (mostly some integration problem), translated this into a &#x27;block diagram&#x27;, built this with wires, and then you could fiddle around at the dials and knobs and see how the result changed on an oscilloscope. I was told that this was mainly used to simulate how complex real-world industrial systems like coal energy plant components would behave under extreme conditions.

This is what I have struggled the most with. During all of my programming classes I worried that I was not cut out for it, because I am business student minoring in comp sci in the world of students who live for programming. But after a while I really learned that everyone in class always struggled with the same problems that I had, everyone was just to proud in a way to ask each other for help. Eventually everyone broke down and that was when the most fun happened in class, and with the programming. It was really cool struggling with other programmers.<p>By the end of all my programming classes my fear was not that bad, but I still fear doing any hack-a-thons or anything like that, because I shoot myself down.<p>I am working on getting over that fear, but its good to know I am not the only one.",1443985114

10328406,comment,10328237,10328237,0,0,lordnacho,,,"From my perspective, the annoying thing about either driving or using public transport is it feels like wasted time. Sure, you can listen to some Great Courses while you&#x27;re on a long drive, but apart from that you&#x27;re trying carefully not to get in a crash. If you&#x27;re on a subway or bus there&#x27;s barely any space, so most kinds of work are out of the question. So the self-driving car will be a massive improvement because it frees up your time.<p>Net, everyone gains an hour or two each day.<p>Assuming the SDC is reasonably cheap to run:<p>- The school run changes significantly. You don&#x27;t need to live quite so near school any more. Yes, there is such a thing as the school bus, but that ties everyone to the same schedule and some parents are not comfortable with sending smaller kids on it. Depends a lot on the culture where this SDC lands. (Where I live, kids walk themselves to school. I lived in places where you sent kids on public transport, too. Or a school bus.) In any case, it means you don&#x27;t have to be with the kid as they go to school. And they can do whatever after school activity they like, it doesn&#x27;t need coordination with public transport.<p>- You can get drunk anywhere, not just where there are cabs/trains/buses nearby. You can keep partying until you literally faint in your car.<p>- You can live quite far away from work. An SDC with a bed could be a comfy commute. You can get things done while commuting. Heck, someone will build a house where the bedroom moves (or just park in your garage, but someone will build it in). Brush your teeth, get into your car, wake up where you need to be.<p>- You don&#x27;t even need a fixed address if your SDC is a camper van. Combine it with a remote job and you are on a constant tour. I reckon someone will do this reasonably soon and show us.<p>- Think of all the things that are limited by having to go home afterwards (clubbing), or are normally quite remote (eg race tracks). They can all be made more attractive if nobody feels they&#x27;re wasting time getting to them. It&#x27;s possible there will be extra rush hours during each day.",1443984968

Programmers naturally lean towards constructs with light syntax and away from constructs with heavy syntax: just think about defining maps in Python or JavaScript (with nice literals) vs in Java, or think about higher-order functions in Haskell (with currying and tiny lambdas) vs JavaScript vs Java. And, as the article pointed out, the syntax can affect how somebody <i>learns</i> a programming language.<p>On the other hand, syntax is unimportant because we learn to see <i>beyond syntax</i>, to the concepts underneath. Syntax is ultimately just notation and notation is not the most important thing. Semantics are important! There are much deeper differences between languages than mere syntax. At this point, I don&#x27;t even think of code in terms of concrete syntax most of the time, although this might be exacerbated by my background studying programming language design and theory.<p>Personally, I think different people tend to overemphasize one side of this or the other, with more people <i>over</i> valuing syntax than not. In my perfect world the solution to confusing syntax would be to teach people to disassociate syntax and semantics early on, but that&#x27;s a tall order.

There is the potential for major problems with traffic as people move from taking transit to riding in a self-driving car.  The subway infrastructure moves a lot of people, and if you move a lot of them up to the street level, the streets may not be able to cope.  A lot of plusses and minuses come to mind.<p>1. Until all cars are self-driving, we will still need traffic lights, and so intersections will still be a big bottleneck.<p>2. Self driving cars may be able however to maintain closer following distances since they have quicker reaction times.<p>3. Jaywalking has the potential to cause huge traffic problems because pedestrians will know that self driving cars won&#x27;t hit them.<p>4. Parking can be made more efficient by sharing cars.  This is already happening in Berlin and other cities with floating carsharing systems.<p>5. Parking can also be made a lot more efficient if there are self-driving parking lots or areas marked off on the street, and the self-driving cars have a protocol to cooperate with parking.  Parallel parked cars can be parked bumper-to-bumper, and they all just scoot out of the way to let someone out.  In a lot, cars can park much more closely packed left-right since doors don&#x27;t need to open, and the driving lanes can be reduced or eliminated if cars cooperate to get out of the way when one has to leave.  This may free up street area to add extra driving lanes.<p>6. More people will probably share rides with a self driving Uber Pool/Lyft line type model.<p>7. If cars are shared, a lot of the fleet can be very small two or even one seat cars that take up less space in the road and parking.<p>8. Car interiors will resemble an office workstation.

As Wikipedia states, Three Prisoners &quot;is mathematically equivalent to the Monty Hall problem with car and goat replaced with freedom and execution respectively&quot;.  But mathematically equivalent may not make it intuitively equivalent, and the answer may feel like it contradicts the correct Monty Hall answer.<p>Wikipedia points out that it&#x27;s originally from a 1950&#x27;s Martin Gardner column, but I came across it in the textbook &quot;Stastistical Inference&quot; by Casella and Berger.  Here&#x27;s C&B&#x27;s phrasing:<p><pre><code>  Three prisoners, A, B, and C, are on death row. The governor
  decides to pardon one of the three and chooses at random the
  prisoner to pardon. He informs the warden of his choice but
  requests that the name be kept secret for a few days. The     
  next day, A tries to get the warden to tell him who had been
  pardoned. The warden refuses. A then asks which of B or C
  will be executed. The warden thinks for a while, then tells A
  that B is to be executed.

  Warden’s reasoning: Each prisoner has a 1 in 3
  chance of being pardoned. Clearly, either B or C must be   
  executed, so I have given A no information about whether A 
  will be pardoned.

  A’s reasoning: Given that B will be executed, then either A
  or C will be pardoned. My chance of being pardoned has
  risen to 1 in 2.

  Who is right? 
</code></pre>
In what I found to be a parody of textbook tropes, C&B begin their explanation &quot;It should be clear that the warden&#x27;s reasoning is correct...&quot;<p>While it&#x27;s true that the warden&#x27;s reasoning is correct, leading off with &quot;it should be clear&quot; seems cruel.  Here&#x27;s a slight variation of the Monty Hall problem, one of the most famous &quot;paradoxes&quot; of popular statistics, and you are going to start with a paraphrase of &quot;it should be obvious to the reader&quot; without the slightest sense of irony, even though this variation produces an answer superficially incompatible with the better known problem?  Ah, the strange humor of textbook authors!

In PG, accumbens DA is maximal during a gambling task when the probability of winning and losing money is identical—a 50% chance for a two-outcome event representing maximal uncertainty (Linnet et al., 2012). Although non-dopaminergic neurons might also be involved in the coding of reward uncertainty (Monosov and Hikosaka, 2013), these results based on electrophysiological and neuroimaging techniques indicate that DA is crucial for the coding of reward uncertainty. This suggestion is corroborated by a large number of behavioral studies, showing that mammals and birds respond more vigorously to conditioned cues predicting uncertain rewards (Collins et al., 1983; Anselme et al., 2013; Robinson et al., under review) and tend to prefer an uncertain food option over a certain food option in dual-choice tasks (Kacelnik and Bateson, 1996; Adriani and Laviola, 2006), sometimes despite a lower reward rate (Forkman, 1991; Gipson et al., 2009). According to Greg Costikyan, an award-winning game designer, games cannot hold our interest in the absence of uncertainty—which can take many forms, occurring in the outcome, the game&#x27;s path, analytical complexity, perception, and so on (Costikyan, 2013).",1443983250

At least in New York, being near a subway stop is a very nice amenity and commercial development typically flourishes around each stop regardless of neighborhood. If stepping into a self-driving car is as easy as walking 50 feet to the nearest subway stop, will real estate around subways command less of a premium?<p>I guess the bigger question is, will subways have as much demand once self-driving cars become big? Obviously, no, if the cost for hailing a self-driving car becomes almost as inexpensive as a subway. But there are things the city of New York could do to impact that, such as reduce street capacity (i.e. increasing pedestrian and bike capacity).<p>But that&#x27;s just New York. Everywhere else in the U.S. where mass transit is not a daily option, automated cars will be a daily habit. Inevitably, as more and more people migrate to New York and expect automated cars to be the default option, it&#x27;s hard to imagine subways (and buses) winning out, absent some major limitation in self-driving car production or capability.<p>New York will always be an anomaly...but yes, I&#x27;d have to agree with your speculation that suburban living would become much more attractive without having to worry about car ownership or driving. And this would most definitely impact commuters to New York. But if self-driving cars become a ubiquitous option, will there be the political appetite to continue subsidizing mass transit rail, such as the kind that is currently used to bring in upstate workers to the city today?",1443982891

So you could put multiple such contexts (pointers or other access methods like functions or even macros) in scope at the top of the function/block, rather than having to type-check every access throughout the function using an implicit control (e.g. the &#x27;th&#x27; variable.)

     video_thread_data_t *vid = &L(video_data);  // checked global access

City living is more affordable.<p>* Traffic Congestion is reduced so commutes are shorter creating more demand for suburb living.<p>* Distances feel shorter because they are no longer inconvenient so living outside the city makes more sense - more suburb demand.<p>* City living gets even more desirable because of the abundance of cheap self-driving cabs not available in more rural areas - city prices go up.<p>* More?<p>I&#x27;m sure some of these things will have a very little impact while others will have huge impact.

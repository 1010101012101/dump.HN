496297,comment,495976,496163,0,0,pxlpshr,,,"<i>We originally partnered with another company and they wound up going out of business. We picked up all of the development work on that, and that was definitely a little bit of stumbling block and took us more resources than we expected.</i><p>That was the company I use to work for. Here's my comment I posted on HN from a few days ago on an article that did not get voted to home page:<p>#####<p>I'm particularly fond of Quake Live because a) I was heavy into competitive gaming back in the day and b) I dropped everything in my life and moved to California to work for the startup whose products influenced the creation of Quake Live. Assuming they still use the same technology stack, it's running on an Oracle DB and using Jabber and a few other common web languages at the transport & display layer. [There is a unique browser plugin to handle file distribution, and the game itself is a substantially polished version of Q3. There's no flash aside from maybe a few widgets.]<p>I say 'influenced' because the tech we sold id Software for QL has been significantly altered and re-written by their very talented team to fit their own ideas and intentions. [They picked up a few of our tech guys when the company shut down.]<p>The cool thing is based on my experience beta testing Quake Live since Dec. 07, a lot of design principles still seem to be intact. You can see screenshots of our first B2C gaming product from 06/07 here, you may notice a few similarities such as the queue system:<p><a href=""http://startupdistrict.think27.com/colin/www/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://startupdistrict.think27.com/colin/www/</a><p>The company had to close its doors b/c we ran out of money among other things... however, it was one of the best learning experiences of my life and I have absolutely no regrets. Very happy to see that Quake Live has finally come to life!<p>#####<p>It's worth noting that we tried courting other studios to do the same with their old IP, but very few were interested. I think in retrospect we had some issues with packaging our technology to make it easy to use, but also a little ahead of our time. Furthermore, the gaming industry is so big now — it's like trying to be an actor in Hollywood. Without any street credit, it's extremely difficult to get a deal as a technology supplier and even harder to get funding. Selling our tech to id Software was a 'loss leader' that didn't pay off because, well, it took a lot longer to come to life than anyone was expecting.<p>When we were working on the product linked to above, the hardest part was having to 'bolt on' to other games without the original source code, and I believe that was a leading reason why the B2C product failed. We always wanted to make our own game to realize the vision of game+web, we just didn't have the money/resources to do it. That said, a leading reason the B2B tech offering failed was because it wasn't easy to use — it was tailored to our experience bolting on to games.<p>The outcome of it sucks for us, I wish we were still around but I couldn't be happier that id Software has been behind this as they are one of the few still supporting the hardcore FPS PC gamers (QuakeCon, etc..).",1235677616

496244,comment,495857,495923,0,0,smcdow,,,"Yes, calories==energy. But why is it necessarily ""spill out all over""? If thermodynamics apply (and they do), then adding more fuel to a fire makes the fire burn hotter. Or, to keep the car analogy, pumping more gas to the engine makes the engine run faster, and thereby consume all the fuel being pumped into it.<p>So, by analogy (and since we're talking about simple thermodynamics), eating more calories should make your metabolism run faster. More fuel, more fire, higher rate of fuel consumption. This is definitely true for those people who can eat lots of food and never get fat. Ectomorphs.<p>So, why doesn't this rule apply to everyone? Why do some people store what they eat as fat and others just burn it all off regardless of how little they exercise. Why aren't we all ectomophs? Genetics may come into play, sure, but all humans have the same genome.<p>The difference must be related to differences in our bodies. Which means differences in hormonal reflexes, differences in responses to certain types of food, etc.<p>It is about calories, but it's not _just_ about calories. It's about our bodies, too, and how we've conditioned them to process different kinds of foods.<p>Highly recommend ""Good Calories, Bad Calories"" by Gary Taubes.",1235675320

I know an engineer who mentioned features of ""Vista"" she didn't like, that turned out to be exclusive to the new Office ribbon.  Any XP user who upgraded Office would see the same issues, but to her, this was <i>Vista's</i> fault.  Microsoft would surely start fielding phone calls from customers displeased with some ""feature of Windows 7"" that turns out to be an oddity in Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Opera.  Forcing Microsoft to <i>ship</i> alternatives is the wrong decision for support reasons.  It may be more sensible to just give users <i>links</i> to browser vendor web sites, I don't know.<p>Then there's the question of how to implement OS features.  Both Windows and Mac OS X have standard HTML help systems, for instance, and it would suck if they had to shoehorn in the user's preferred browser as the renderer for a simple pop-up help window.  What you care about here is not the specific browser, but whether or not it is <i>sandboxed</i> properly.  IE is ""good enough"" for actually rendering OS features, the problem is that as soon as a help file visits the wrong web site the system can still be trashed (when it should be protected).  Microsoft has to clean up IE's ties to the OS, simply having IE present is not the problem.",1235675223

496237,comment,496079,496079,0,0,mileszs,,,"I think <a href=""http://amiestreet.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amiestreet.com</a> might solve a subset of Zed's problems (or, perhaps just the ""you can't charge for your music"" problem).  On AmieStreet, a song starts free or cheap, and rises in cost as its popularity grows (capped at 98 cents per song).  AmieStreet has a ""REC"" system that is similar to PopCuts' fan-revenue-sharing model that ""thetable"" mentions in these comments, somewhere.  On AmieStreet, when a fan recommends (RECs) a song, and from that point on it continues to rise in price (and in popularity), they put money into your AmieStreet account.  The site also suggests music based on your previous choices, you can preview everything, it has a player widget built in that will allow you to start previewing one album while browsing to other artists on AmieStreet, etc.<p>AmieStreet is a really great experience, for the fan.  I cannot testify as to the experience for the musician.  I could see not being able to set your own price point as annoying.  Artists do keep 70% of the proceeds after $5 (so, AmieStreet is still a middle man), paid quarterly.<p>AmieStreet's Wikipedia entry is short but interesting. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amie_Street#cite_note-ForArtists-19"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amie_Street#cite_note-ForArtist...</a>)<p>I have not used PopCuts, but I'm checking it out now.<p>EDIT: For the record, I have no affiliation with AmieStreet, other than being a user.  I do have a bit of an infatuation, though.",1235675144

Having worked in both boutique and large conglomerate firm settings, I can attest to the fact boutiques are far more organized and, because their overhead is so much less, far less expensive.<p>W/r/t at what point in your development cycle you should register the TM, I have seen the spectrum of very early to very late filings. While in one instance a late-stage filing resulted in more similar marks out there (and the class claims for goods/ services had to be much more limited) I have not yet seen it be detrimental to getting registered eventually.<p>On the other hand, small start-ups (both net based and brick-and-mortar) account for a disproporionate number of the applications we have to let go abandoned due to client request or nonpayment.",1235675077

496233,comment,495188,496052,0,0,smanek,,,"I work at a defense contractor now (and have worked in a tech shop and corporate IT before).<p>The main problem I've found in defense contracting is that it isn't flexible, and (in my opinion) too many design decisions are made at too high a level. Details that don't really matter (what implementation of X we're going to use in development, for example) are decided (and made effectively immutable) before it makes sense to do so by people not actually doing the coding. To be fair, I've only been around for a month (and this is just my experience with one contract), so take it with a pinch of salt.<p>Corporate IT, in my opinion, is pretty boring. There were two of us supporting ~500 users across the world (offices in Chicago, NY, LA, London, etc), and I still had a lot of down time. We had some simple tools that took care of 90% of our work (re-imaging, backups, data migration, etc), and the rest were a lot of reasonably easy one-off jobs (simple tool to parse excel reports, load monitioring webapps, etc) or product evaluation (Evaluate these n products, talk to these 2n vendors (sorry, 'solution providers'), and write a report on your recommendation). There were one or two reasonably interesting projects (a 'visual voicemail' feature hacked onto our avaya phone system and some genetic algorithms for scheduling a conference), but they were the exception. Far more time on the phone talking to end users and vendors than I would like.",1235674945

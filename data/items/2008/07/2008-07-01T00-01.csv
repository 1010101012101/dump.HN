It would really simplify this process.<p>Then again, and this is somewhat of a modest proposal: why not just use dead people [donated to science] for these tests? If you can get their immune system, all by itself, functioning again (say they're decapitated, but you've installed a pacemaker and are filtering their blood), why not use it instead of some animal's with very little resemblance?",1214873996

The people with several thousand referalls were sometimes pulling in several thousands of dollars in monthly checks (albeit, only about 6 months maybe.)<p>Say what you will, that's a hell of a return for basically putting an affliate link up on a busy website (one guy was running a basic wallpaper website.) AllAdvantage might have gone bankrupt, but it paid out $49 mil to a lot of small site owners in one year. That's pretty cool.<p>(Business model never had a prayer, though.)",1214873570

There is no problem in determining simultaneity because there is only one FOR in question. And even in multiple FORs, their relative speed would have to approach that of light for any ant to notice a difference between local times. Deny at your own detriment.",1214873562

232590,comment,231758,232166,0,0,gruseom,,,"Well, the easy way to use Lisp macros in a compiler is to start with an s-expr and successively transform it until you've got something that the target platform accepts. ""Starting with an s-expr"" implies that your source code is in Lisp format. So in that sense, what you're compiling is a Lisp derivative. Is that what you mean?<p>No doubt there are clever ways to leverage Lisp macros in compilers beyond this approach. But most people who like Lisp macros wouldn't bother. They'd just do it the easy way.<p>Edit: my understanding of what DaniFong is getting at is that in Lisp programming, there is no longer a barrier between application development and compiler development. This makes possible a lot of powerful things that you can't do when the application is written in a fixed language by different programmers than the ones who write the compiler. It's a different point, but one I find very interesting. It's not obvious what belongs to application development and what belongs to language development once this technical (and organizational) barrier is removed.",1214872462

I'm not exactly sure what you offer that say a Google Document could do, apart from a nicer interface.  It surely doesn't seem worth $10 to create a list of birthday presents (and I'm also unsure who would do that?)<p>I think you'd do much better partnering with someone like Stoeffels, David Jones, etc and getting them to pay you per person that signs up, or per purchase.<p>Also I think it's a bit offputting to put prices on there for things you don't offer, etc.  Have you had any signups or actual payments yet?",1214872153

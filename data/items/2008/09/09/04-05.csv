Those who use Macs use Safari, for the most part. Basically no one has heard of Opera. But I don't know of a single non-technical user who ""hates"" any of those brands.<p><i>For many people IE == internet</i><p>I think you give far too little credit to most Internet users. Even among older users, the vast majority are aware of the difference between a client application and a website.",1220935814

299089,comment,298823,298952,0,0,unalone,,,"-They do, but that refers (again) to the CORE. Developers can do whatever they damn well please.<p>-Citation needed. CustomizeGoogle makes Google ugly. I see no reason why Firefox would do that. And AdBlock is a big deal, but at the same time, it's a bulky implementation and Firefox needs, more than anything, to slim down. Meanwhile, Google and Firefox programmers have similar motives and a similar system to work from. Firefox will copy Chrome, Chrome will get plug-ins, and then it's likely they'll stay as much in tandem as all the big compliant browsers are now.<p>-Most people don't CARE about profile tracking, first-off. Google, meanwhile, has announced that they'll be making a system for plug-ins, by which we assume they mean extensions, and one of the first ones that always gets made is an AdBlocker. Your Chrome argument is stupid: you can choose NOT to send data to Google if you choose, and if you do then you're totally off the loop. Like Google Toolbar for, what's the name again, Firefox.<p>Bonus comment:<p>-I understand that Ashu made a relevant comment that happened to knock yours back, but if somebody argues with you, don't get snipy. It pisses us third-party viewers off. Just argue back with your points and with minimum arrogance, and hopefully people will upvote you if what you're saying is relevant at all. In your case, though, you're arguing a fairly moot case and you're doing it in a pretty factless way, so you'd do best to reassemble your argument if anything.",1220933980

Can you imagine how hard it will be to get 5 people organized for a board meeting?<p>I think a normal vesting schedule makes more sense, perhaps with double-trigger acceleration.<p>Right of first refusal will make future funding rounds hard, especially since the future round really ought to be priced by a new party. Typically, a prorata share is offered. This is very important in the event of a down round.<p>I wish I could have done my legal work for $6k. That doesn't smell likely to me.",1220933348

While I think I've something of a hacker personality, I'm far more a critic than I am a hacker. And most hackers are completely unpolished and unfocused. The people who follow my account on Twitter, for instance, are the sorts of people who constantly linkspam. I can't stand that. And I find some people on Twitter funny, but that isn't productive and it's not thought-provoking. Blog posts at least provide some thought: Twitter, I find, rarely does.",1220933235

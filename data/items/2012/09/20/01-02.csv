One of the most popular apps, PayTango, had a completely faked demo from what I saw (I saw the play button show up when they tapped a button on the iPad, revealing that it was just an image slideshow of mockups). That and the demo time was severely truncated, 75 seconds is enough to demo about one feature, and when your app has several features it's impossible to show it all. \nThe press didn't even cover some of the coolest hacks in my opinion, like <a href=""http://pokebattle.herokuapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pokebattle.herokuapp.com</a> , <a href=""http://bbcat.co"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bbcat.co</a> , <a href=""http://electioneering.us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://electioneering.us</a> , and <a href=""http://notableapp.herokuapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://notableapp.herokuapp.com</a> , and some more I can't recall.\nI understand that it's hard for them to deal with so many participants though (it was may more than they had planned), so I applaud them for their effort and expect them to improve their plans accordingly for the spring event, which will definitely be just as popular if not more-so.",1348106330

Solid.<p>Anyway, I can't answer the question, but I can give an answer: It was cool at first, but now it's just too much of the same thing. all the features and crap that have been added, from what i've seen and heard, have cluttered up the interface. by contrast, when gmail adds features, they barely touch the core of the app and add things that make it easier to use the core of the app. Facebook could learn a thing or 2 about that.<p>Google = Diversify and Focus.

Have you really analyzed the sum-total of his behaviors/moves and feel you can conclusively state that the above 11 ""laws"" are the cornerstone of his success? I doubt that. Also, the book you reference is really not useful for any human being that intends to be part of a actual society. It is a great primer for a sociopath, but I will assume that is not what you aspire to be. Some people see successful sociopaths and incorrectly conclude their sociopathy is what made them successful. That is like assuming Steve Jobs, who was somewhat notorious for being...blunt, was successful because he was an asshole, instead of in spite of that characteristic. It also willfully ignores a lot of non-sociopaths that are successful and disregards other factors that may be more causative.<p>I would take that book with a <i>big</i> grain of salt and not use it as a manual for life. Or you can, I just dont predict great success. I would predict a long string of people telling other people what an ass you are and causing you to have countless doors closed to you without ever knowing it or knowing why; primarily because people dont relish partnering with/working for/associating with sociopaths. For every ""successful"" sociopath you see that lives by those ""laws"" there are millions of others that also live by those ""laws"" that have nothing to show for it but a string of failed relationships and a complete and utter lack of friends.

This sucks for app developers with bad app store SEO and lackluster icons, app designs, and screenshots of said designs. Many apps at the bottom of the stack will be neglected. This is a good thing. I'm about to release an app into the app store for the first time and I'm happy about it.<p>This will raise the bar for developers. It'll force them to do better app store SEO and it'll force the, to pay attention to design. Ugly apps aren't always necessarily bad but more ugly apps are bad than ugly apps that are good. This isn't Android. On iOS, users tend to judge an app by its icon and screenshots and they use pretty apps more than they open ugly ones. I didn't make the rules, I just play by them. Developers should be welcoming competition and with so many crap apps out there today it's probably better for good app developers to work on getting their rankings higher while the crap app makers languish at the end of the results.<p>While its bad for developers it's great for buyers. Guess what? There are far more buyers than developers on the app store. You may argue that if developers leave then iOS will die. Not so. Again, iOS users are a different animal. They can live with just a few big name apps from the major players. Android users tend to like lots of apps from indie devs and iOS users do too but if push came to shove they'd just keep their Angry Birds, Skype, Facebook, Twitter, and Yelp and go on with their day. Screenshots are very important in the buying process and putting them front and center like this.<p>As developers we tend to think we're the center of the universe. We place far too much importance on our role than is deserved. Witness the outrage over Twitter's API. While developers were screaming about revolt the users barely noticed and kept tweeting away. Meanwhile Twitter pretty much gave us the finger because they know we'll be back because they have the users. Developers are like parents in a way. We raise a platform then the platform rebels. We threaten to cut them off but by that point the platform is all grown up and doesn't need our help anymore. iOS won't be hurt by developers leaving. If developers leave over not being found in search results then by definition they're leaving because no one's using the app. Who's going to miss an app that never gets used?",1348105043

Technology is a wonderful thing, as is the fact that people are willing to pitch in and led equipment, talent, and locations for nothing. But...<p>a) if you work this way (with actors doubling up as crew and so on), then you say goodbye to QA. Although there are clear improvements from project to project the quality is...not good. I don't want to go through a laundry list of critcisms. But I suggest ditching the DV camera, getting a DSLR, and learning to shoot at 24p with a 1/50 shutter speed. The cost and time savings of not using DV tapes <i>alone</i> will cover the food bill for your shoot.<p>b) ""I raised $2,000 using Kickstarter."" That's a very small budget, but it's a hell of a lot bigger than $0, no? This sort of bait-and-switch marketing technique only works if you have a commercial release. Your budget is part of your marketing plan, and you can only use this trick once. OK, so the point is that the filmmaker did it with $0 of his own cash. There's a thin line between creatively financing your project on a shoestring, and coming off as a freeloader.<p>c) ""If this is what I did with $2,000 imagine what I could do with $2,000,000."" Production companies in Hollywood hear this pitch approximately weekly. The response (among themselves, not to you) is 'I'm perfectly capable of wasting my own money.' What you need to focus on now is leveraging the achievements so far into a $20,000 budget (enough to pay a minimum wage to a small crew and cast), and having a plan to generate a similar amount of revenue. <i>That</i> will open doors to larger things.",1348104423

Mark is clearly a talented individual.<p>However what is good for Facebook =/= what is good for Facebook users. And one point that emerges from Greenspan's description of Mark is that the man may be a genius for cutting out friends and building an empire, but when it comes to human warmth, he's lacking. And the problem with that is that it may very well limit Mark's ability to imagine how something like Facebook could evolve and work, and thus limit his ability to better equate what is good for Facebook with what is good for users.<p>A subsidiary point is that, due to network effects, Facebook's vulnerability to a poor core philosophy is reduced, at least in the short term. Once a social network grows into our lives, it isn't easy to replace. So if Facebook is indeed ""rotten at the core"" (I'm not arguing it is necessarily... just saying) then it may be able to buy itself a lot of time, even if it acts in its ""own"" interests, not its users'. But as technology continues to develop and its environment destabilises it won't remain invulnerable forever. Unless you are interested in slavery and extortion, eventually, under our moderated democratic capitalist model, what is good for a company is being good for its users.",1348104029

Not trying to pass judgement on Zuckerburg's virtues or lack thereof (it's best to accept the inherent unfairness in life on the road to power), but he is a master of power plays:<p>Law 3: Never put too much trust in friends, learn how to use enemies.\nIf only Zuck's ""friends"" knew about the first part of the law. Zuck was, however, a master in exploiting and gaining information from his ""enemies"". Further, he used what his competitions to frame what his product should be.<p>Law 4: Conceal your intentions.\n""Keep people off-balance and in the dark by never revealing the purpose behind your actions"" -- apparent in both the Winklevoss and Greenspan's stories. Zuck misled and deceived until the right time.<p>Law 5: Always say less than necessary...classic Zuck, ""There was a need for facebook, so I made it""<p>Law 6: Court attention at all cost.\nHis fight to receive coverage in the Crimson ensuring the early dominance of thefacebook.<p>Law 7: Get others to do the work for you, but always take the credit.\nIf any of the stories about facebook is true, then Zuck's a textbook example of observing this law. According to Greene:  using other people's work ""not only will [...] save you valuable time and energy, it will give you a godlike aura of efficiency and speed"". Clearly it has worked to achieve his ""genius"" aura.<p>Law 9: Win through your actions, never through argument.\nHe never let the lawsuits detract him away from the work too much. Now that facebook is too big, what actually happened really doesn't matter anymore.<p>Law 11: Learn to keep people dependent on you.\nFacebook is too big now...G_G<p>Law 12: Use selective honesty and generosity to disarm your victim.\nThe part about facebook's frequent change and backtracks of privacy must has something to do with this.<p>Law 13: When asking for help, appeal to people's self-interest, never to their mercy or gratitude.\nZuckerburg appealed to Greenspan's desire to help entrepreneurs when asking for advice. Also, his claim that Greenspan was one of those on his level can be seen more of a classic ego-stroking rather than admission of admiration.<p>Law 14: Pose as a friend, work as a spy.\n""Knowing about your rival is critical. Play the spy yourself to gather valuable information that will keep you a step ahead. [...] There is no occasion that is not an opportunity for artful spying"".\nYeah, Zuck's a master at this.<p>Law 15: Crush your enemey totally.\nCheck.<p>So out of the first 18 laws, the rise of facebook and Zuckerburg have observed 11, textbook style. His amoral approach to power and life is definitely key to his success.",1348103700

When I played Fallout 3 it crashed about once every few hours of play time, and that was late 2012 with no add-ons -- 4 years after the game's release you'd expect patches to address things.  Bethesda has a kind of reputation for releasing buggy games, it seems.",1348102929

While I always despair at his inability to say something succinctly, he generally always makes an excellent point.<p>Facebook provides an excellent service to most people in the world and it does so at a level that your $20,000 cannot buy. While we as a more discerning social customer may see it as extremely low value, the production values are actually extremely high. I always think of my national rag the Sun in these instances, it's utter trash, but they really worked hard on making it extremely good trash.<p>Alas for the article, to be honest the whole thing reads of bitterness, not unjustified if we are looking at 'justice'. But Zuck is a complete $&!t, and an extremely lucky one at that, but in business that's just the way it works. Moaning about it is futile. The only way to end up playing at that level is probably ending up being a complete $&!t as well. There are few big founders who haven't done very dodgy things in their time.",1348102827

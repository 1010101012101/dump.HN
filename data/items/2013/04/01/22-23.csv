I agree with OP that HN readers have a reputation for quality, and I'm surprised that he's seeing so many low-effort responses.  I've seen several employers set up ""nerd hurdles"" that require potential applicants to do something that takes a modicum of effort (and talent) before they can apply -- e.g. coding challenges.  Maybe that can help weed out less-serious applicants.",1364857198

One says pretty explicitly that they don't guarantee that they meet full need for transfers, even though they brag about it for their 18 year old freshman applicants. The other seems more welcoming, but I'm still nervous. I don't know if I've gotten into them or not, either. I can barely afford $3500/year tuition for a community college, much less something way above that while also paying to move and live in another state. (Luckily I got 2 science scholarships to cover my CC tuition for the 2012-2013 year, but I still have to worry about food and rent.

My first inclination is a two part sleeve - but I'm assuming then it's a two player game, more players requires some ingenuity - the sleeves start at zero score and cover the lower numbers, moving towards the highest possible score at the centre as the sleeves meet and cover the whole container.<p>Perhaps a graduated stick, like a long cocktail stick/drink stirrer, for each player, you pull the stick across a line (eg from under the box) to indicate the score. Another way would be to have a stack of counters, like tiddlywinks, you could upsell different counter sets then (half marbles, cut stones, metal, different designs). Counters might work  for tie-ins - planets of the Starfleet federation, planets named for houses of GoT or such.

And if ""not replacing AES"" is the battle you're fighting, you're already totally screwed, I guess.<p>When I think about Schneier's contributions to the field, _Applied_ and _Practical_ don't count; they're books, not papers. I'm suggesting instead that you look at his cite record. There's significant stuff there! But it's virtually always as part of teams of otherwise well-established cryptography researchers, and it's clearly not of the same kind as say Joan Daemen or Daniel Bleichenbacher or Don Coppersmith or Philip Rogaway.

I've got a Bachelor's of CS and am a Front End Engineer with roughly 5 years of engineering experience. The first half of those years was spent working full stack, and the last half working very closely with Backbone, jQuery, Require, and other modern JS frameworks. I've launched numerous very successful products, and consistently get nothing but positive remarks in annual reviews.<p>I make roughly 115k a year, which at first seemed like a ton after moving here from a relatively low COL area. Lately though, the combination of looking at my account balances after paying rent + seeing people talk about salaries on HN make me think that I am on the very low end of the pay scale. Combine that with the paltry amount of equity I have and the fact that my company gives absolutely zero bonuses, and it all leaves me thinking that there might be greener pastures in other companies in the Valley.<p>So what's your opinion HN: Are the people paid above the median the vocal minority, or should I reevaluate my situation for more fair compensation?",1364856253

5476413,comment,5475525,5475932,5,0,205guy,,,"Both you and the dissenting judge seem to take issue with the complexity of the technical approach. That does not seem like a legal argument. I understand that if someone goes to great lengths to do something illegal, say hide their transactions and funds with multiple offshore accounts to avoid paying taxes, it can be a legal argument (it's proof of knowing and evading). But in this case, the goal is something legal: a consumer setting up a private antenna, connecting it to a private DVR and watching it over the internet. Aereo figured there would be a market demand, so they figured out a way to do it economically for a lot of people at the same time.<p>[In fact, I wonder if Aereo is patenting their antenna array and general setup. It's clearly a highly complex innovation.]<p>Actually, there is an exception to tresspassing: the complex dance involves getting certified as a pilot and using an airplane--and staying a certain level above ground. Here's another exception: some jurisdictions allow native populations access to land regardless of private ownership (though ancestry is less generalizable). Medical marijuana might be more similar: it's generally illegal, except for certain illness, so all of a sudden, a lot of people are getting diagnosed (with certain doctors and dispensaries gaining). My point is, all these models of interaction (real property, media copyright, and consumer rights) have loopholes of various degrees, or rather overlaps in what is allowed and what is gained (access vs. property rights, entertainment vs. commercials).<p>Essentially, the market is still maturing. The model of over-the-air TV with commercials is not the end-all-be-all of consumer entertainment. Other models are being developed at its expense, reshaping the legal and economical landscape as they go, and of course the established players user their clout to hang on as long as possible.<p>Actually, HBO is evolving. It was already cable-only in response to the shifting of these winds decades ago. Now it is releasing series (Game of Thrones) on its own terms. You see people who say ""take my money, just let me download it."" But having avoided the gray areas such as over-the-air broadcasting, it is in a position of power. It knows people want the series, that desire creates value, and it is in a position to reap that value. Sure there is torrenting, but from a copyright position, violaters are defintely in the wrong.<p>As a result, I wonder if this ruling will eventually lead to the end of over-the-air TV transmission. And in the short term, it wouldn't surprise me if Aereo's facility suddenly had very poor reception due to some antenna misalignments at their local transmitter.",1364856234

According to the author, O'Reilly hides the political claim that small government is good behind technological newspeak about governments providing only the essential APIs for the private sector to build on. In coining new terms for old ideas he is ignoring the vast literature of political and philosophical thought discussing these matters and gaining the support of hackers for a political agenda.

The biggest decider in whether you will be successful at a new skill is if you put in the hours, and you are more likely to put in the hours if you are having fun and engaged. If putting together a crappy web app makes you stick with it better than learning data structures, then it's better. Plus, for the majority of us, the end product is the real goal, and we only care about algorithms as far as it helps us achieve those goals. Lessons on code maintainability and algorithms will seem much more relevant and engaging once you tried to add features to your spaghetti code base or figure out why your application was so slow. Also, for some people who have a specific end goal in mind, maintainability or algorithms really don't actually matter because they have smaller goals.<p>To me it's similar to learning an instrument. Learning scales and doing finger exercises may be more useful practice than just playing songs you like all the time, but again, what's more important is that you consistently practice. As you learn more songs, you might struggle on parts or want to improvise and then you will be more engaged to learn technique or scales, and some people will be happy they can strum a few chords and never worry about more. In short, 1000 hours of mediocre practice will usually beat 10 hours of perfect practice, especially because the mediocre practice provides the motivation for the perfect practice.",1364854184

The only difference here is that the viewing involves the Internet and the outdated assumptions about copying and media distribution upon which copyright is based.  A very long time ago, geographic restrictions made sense, but those days are decades past.<p>Do not make the mistake of thinking that the law is handed down from the heavens.  Laws can be out of date, and laws that were once good at promoting progress can wind up impeding it.<p>""With red flag laws, the obsolete industry was just getting between the transactional relationship between car manufacturers and drivers""<p>No, with red flag laws an obsolete industry was trying to impose restrictions on the use of a new technology to the point of making it impractical.  It had nothing to do with car manufacturers, it was a law that targeted the users of automobiles.  That is exactly what is happening in this case:  the broadcasters and media conglomerates are trying to impose enough restrictions on Aereo's technology that it becomes impractical.<p>The problem with your view of this is that you are connecting the production of entertainment to a specific business model.  Broadcast TV killed Vaudeville, and the Internet is killing broadcast TV.  We had entertainment before copyright, we have had it with copyright, and we will continue to have it in the hypothetical post-copyright world (if we are lucky enough to see such a day).<p>""Indeed, it's internet companies like Youtube, etc, trying to profit by getting in-between the content producers and the content consumers...""<p>You are ignoring the history of those companies.  Youtube would never have existed had the RIAA and MPAA not conspired, lobbied, and abused the justice system for the purpose of killing peer to peer filesharing.  A promising, decentralized technology that allowed anyone to broadcast entertainment on a global scale was destroyed and companies like Youtube took its place.",1364853780

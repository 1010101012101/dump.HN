That's why they happen so seldom - and usually only if the existing package is a pile of unmaintainable crap.<p>The shrink-wrap model encourages chasing adding more bullet points to the outside of the new box over actually improving the day-to-day user experience. The service model encourages making your actual customers happy with their product AFTER the purchase, so they keep buying.<p>The whole concept of a large, up-front fee is driven by traditional mass-media marketing strategy: spend a bunch of money making something sound really great to buy, sell it for a bunch of money up front so you can get a return on your advertising spend. Don't worry about what happens after that.<p>""I don't understand, what is the problem with that?""<p>The problem with that is if there is some small feature change that would really improve the current product (say supporting an additional new file format on import) there is little reason for the maker to add it to the old release. Instead, they lump it in with the new version and hope it forces you to buy a whole new license.

It's not entirely unique, because other casinos are adding the ""in game"" betting using the same system, which was rolled out initially at the M.  This is very different from the normal sports betting because you can bet during the game.  Traditional bookmaking will take bets before an event (sometimes even a long time before, for example, the winner of next year's Super Bowl is already a bet you can make in Vegas) but not during it.<p>I am not sure if a ""in game"" system ever existing before in Las Vegas casinos to the extent that the M is doing it.  The gambling radio shows seem to think it's a novel thing.<p>I should add that this market (sports gambling) has long had ""traders"" (people looking to arbitrage games and do other technical actions), ""brokers"" (people who tell you what to bet on, similar to a stock broker) and ""value"" players (in the betting case this is guys who look for an imbalance in value, undervalued positions usually caused by too many people betting on one side of a game, similar to Buffet looking for undervalued companies).  Recently, I've heard of one of these brokers advertising themselves as an investment group, particularly to the extent that insider trading isn't illegal in gambling (for example, if you have better information on the seriousness of a injury to a key player you have inside information, but instead of it being illegal as it would be in the stock market, it's actively encouraged).<p>This market is huge.  I heard on the radio that Vegas did ~$85 million in bets on the Super Bowl alone.<p>As a final note, if you don't think you're gambling when you put money into the stock market, then I'm not sure what to tell you.",1297143951

Remember that ""better sanitation and hygiene"" is just speculation on what the instrumental causes might be, once vaccination has been cast into doubt. Someone with access to a research library could make a nice research project out of it, digging through footnotes and gathering up the available data.<p>For example, that paper I linked to, <i>Incidence of infectious disease and the licensure of immunobiologics in the United States</i>, probably includes a decent bibliography of relevant sources. Here's the conclusion again:<p><i>Historical data provide evidence of proof of efficacy of mass immunization for measles, polio, rubella, mumps, and pertussis, but not for diphtheria or tetanus.</i><p>That's fairly weak, actually. All they had to do there was establish a trend and then show some minimum degree of deviation. One suspects the data does not support a stronger conclusion. Why not? On first glance I'd guess it's because immunizations were introduced so late into the game, with the trend rapidly approaching zero, that you can't draw strong statistical conclusions.<p>But that's all conjecture on my part. How about other regions of the world?

They basically let you figure out where you'd be most useful, and no one really tells you what to do. It seems to scale well, I suppose.<p><i>A funny thing happened on the way to the solution. Try and picture this. On my first day of work, no one told me what to do. On the second day, the same thing happened, and on the third. That’s as much as I could take. I decided to meet with everyone I was coming in contact with to find out more about their individual talents and personalities, and to find out what was going on. Before I knew it, I was developing a picture of how things really were, and who needed what, and I became creatively involved in defining my own participation in relation to the skills I could bring to the table. In the process of doing this, I had complete access to everyone in the company, from other newlings to the President. Nothing but open cubicles no higher than 3 1/2 feet. I was allowed to learn, interact, and find solutions to every problem and need I recognized. I always found something important to do, and it became natural to provide effective solutions as needed. I am not a very unique individual, but I am effective because I am allowed to be. I also know it may be different for some people, experiencing this kind of freedom. I know that some people are petrified by this kind of freedom, and equate it to abandonment, and it drives them crazy not knowing what to do. I also know that even under the best of circumstances, people become sedate sometimes and settle in to patterns of repetition for false comfort. The answer, then, is to have them all switch places every few years, no matter how well they may be doing their job, because it is just as important to let everyone see their own position from someone else’s position. It also allows for the surprise of finding how much fun change can be when your creativity meets a new challenge. See what you end up with. It’s either this, or that.</i><p>More here: <a href=""http://aditya.sublucid.com/2008/11/20/let-your-employees-figure-out-what-to-do/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aditya.sublucid.com/2008/11/20/let-your-employees-fig...</a>",1297143145

WITH performance in mind.<p>Then when you code it, you DON'T need to deeply optimize stuff with unreadable hacks, that may or may not even work. But you DO need to make smart decisions.<p>Almost every single piece of software i see that is slow, is slow because the underlying design is terrible. It's terrible  because people are taught to ""code now, optimize later"", yet COMPLETELY discard having a decent design performance wise.<p>Here's the trick. Once it's coded, you can't redesign the whole damn thing without losing a monstrous amount of time. So you just try to optimize the parts you can and that's that. And it's slow.<p>Don't go optimize to gain 50ms right off the bat. But do write it properly so that it takes 1s if it can, and not 10min.

These batteries have been used now for quite some time for power. What we RC people know is that while these batteries have great performance, it very easy to make one blow up if not handled correctly. Enough burned out sheds can testify to this. So, even if the engineers say they they can use them safely, I will always feel nervous of their use. Fine for things like RC models, laptops, phones, real cars even etc, but the plane use, to me, has a question mark against it.<p>OK, Im 100% sure engineers can make a great defence of their use, but there will always be a nagging doubt for me.",1359535383

Rather, the core idea is that you program in terms of abstractions that are explicit about time. That is, you write your program in terms of streams of events or signals.<p>You have signals and events, but you never ask about the value <i>right now</i>; instead, you take these two abstractions and combine them in different ways to get a reactive network. In a way, it's similar to dataflow programming or circuit design: you connect up ""wires"" into a network that can constantly push through data. Depending on how you write this network, you will need to remember different amounts of past data at runtime.<p>If you write your event/signal network carefully, you do not need to keep a history of too many prior values at runtime. This is one of the things modern FRP libraries really try to help you with: writing networks that are efficient. At least the ones I've tried are good at this--I haven't had many space problems in my programs so far.<p>In summary, this <i>is</i> a potential issue, and you may have to be a little careful in how you write your FRP code. However, modern frameworks try to make it easy to avoid these pitfalls, and there is no fundamental reason you can't use memory efficiently with this model.",1359535216

Let's go through them:<p><i>fetch</i> - fetching the objects and metadata from a branch or branches from a remote repository<p><i>pulling from upstream</i> - fetching from a remote repository (upstream, in other words all the changes flow down the stream to you, colloquial expression), then merge in the objects you fetched<p><i>cherry pick</i> - choose which changes to apply (""cherry pick"" them, colloquial term)<p><i>filter branch</i> - modify a branch's history via filters<p><i>untracked</i> - files that aren't being tracked by the <i>source control system</i><p><i>symlink</i> - a symbolic link, not even a git concept.<p><i>rebase</i> - replaying all the changes committed from one branch onto another. Literally taking one base, and changing the base of a branch. i.e. re-basing the branch<p><i>tag</i> - marking (or ""tagging"") a significant change in the repository<p><i>HEAD, head (note, mentioned twice by author)</i> - a reference to the head of the revision history<p><i>working copy</i> - the copy of a branch that you work on<p><i>path</i> - really?<p><i>stash</i> - you start working on some code, then you realise you want to change to another branch. So you stash away the working copy for later.<p><i>clone</i> - cloning an existing repository so you can have your own to work on. That's why it's a DVCS<p><i>submodule</i> - an external project from the main repository<p><i>fast-forward</i> - when you merge a branch from another branch, git has the ability to forward the revision pointer quickly to the right point, see [1]<p><i>merge</i> - merging changes<p><i>origin/master</i> - the original repository. Convention.<p><i>staging area</i> - also known as the ""index"", basically the concept is that you checkout a branch into a directory (called the working copy, see above), then you commit any changes into a staging area, then you push the changes into the repository<p>See? none of this was particularly hard to understand (although I grant you that ""rebasing"" and ""fast forward"" is a tricky concept, but hey, it's a source control system)<p>[1] <a href=""http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging"" rel=""nofollow"">http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and...</a>",1359533885

He suddenly realized that he had lost his wallet (it was stolen) and it contained pictures of his children inside. Those were just simple pictures and he could have made copies once coming back home, but instead he wandered in the dangerous quarters of the city to try to find back the pictures from his wallet. He could have been robbed or worse, but he explained he was not aware of those risks at that time because the only thing he was thinking about was that ""I have to find my kids back"". He made a clear association between the pictures and the persons.<p>He then said he could understand the saying regarding pictures and souls, since he went through this experience.",1359533697

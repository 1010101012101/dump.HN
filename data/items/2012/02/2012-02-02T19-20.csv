Which, to my mind, means that the data is both stored, and able to be shared.<p>To the best of my knowledge, they have not said that they would ever share this information with anyone else.  But  Google just changed their privacy policy, and I don't think there is any legal recourse should they decide to change it again.  Given the financial pressures on Google to sell that information, I fear that there is strong likelihood that it will eventually be sold.",1328212688

You can also replace 3 with 'Monopoly slashes prices everywhere and relies on its cash reserves'.""<p>So are we going to have laws now where big companies can't lower and raise their prices?<p>If you want to blame anyone, blame the consumers that only shop for the lowest price.  Walmart is a good example of this in the US.<p>The other problem is that as a small business, you just don't have the resources as the big guys.  For example, you might order 1000 widgets from a supplier for $10,000, but because your competitor orders 100,000, they can get a bulk discount and charge a lower price.<p>Unless we have laws that prevent a business from getting to a certain size and keeping them all small (which I am against), there isn't any way to stop the above scenario.<p>Similar to how software, music, and movie companies need to change their business model, so do small companies.  With globalization becoming easier and easier, they need to offer something that the big guys can't.<p>Trying to compete on price will only put you out of business quickly",1328212665

But $5k-$10k can also net you a nice app.<p>In addition, although this approach saves months of dev time it does take time to find deals. You either have to sift through sites on Flippa, which I did for years, or find deals and cold email like I did. It's not something where one day a deal just drops itself into your lap with no work invested.<p>The hardest one is the first one - once that's going you can use revenue from that to buy the second, and so on.

Five mins later and I've got a stable, tested solution.<p>I've built and sold businesses on PHP, I run some sites on it still.  But I've never got into testing with PHP, it just isn't seamless.  And because of that, I've always hated going back into the code and improving things later - projects have tended to stagnate.  With RoR you have to make an effort NOT to write tests, and making minor tweaks isn't like moonwalking across a minefield.<p>If you just want to whack up a prototype right fucking now then PHP and a Framework are for you.  But if you think that you're working on something more than a punt then either put in the effort to write decent tests in PHP, or use a framework that will force you to do so.<p>In summary - PHP and Yii Framework do <i>almost</i> all of what Rails do.  It's fast, stable, clean and easily deployed.  But the weight of the developer community is now behind Rails.  And Ruby is a neat language that I enjoy working with.",1328211286

The most I could find was VeriSign's original SEC filing at <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1014473/000119312511285850/d219781d10q.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1014473/0001193125112...</a><p>From the filing: <i>We experienced security breaches in the corporate network in 2010 which were not sufficiently reported to Management.</i><p><i>In 2010, the Company faced several successful attacks against its corporate network in which access was gained to information on a small portion of our computers and servers. We have investigated and do not believe these attacks breached the servers that support our Domain Name System (DNS) network. Information stored on the compromised corporate systems was exfiltrated. The Companys information security group was aware of the attacks shortly after the time of their occurrence and the group implemented remedial measures designed to mitigate the attacks and to detect and thwart similar additional attacks. However, given the nature of such attacks, we cannot assure that our remedial actions will be sufficient to thwart future attacks or prevent the future loss of information. In addition, although the Company is unaware of any situation in which possibly exfiltrated information has been used, we are unable to assure that such information was not or could not be used in the future.</i><p><i>The occurrences of the attacks were not sufficiently reported to the Companys management at the time they occurred for the purpose of assessing any disclosure requirements. Management was informed of the incident in September 2011 and, following the review, the Companys management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. However, the Company has implemented reporting line and escalation organization changes, procedures and processes to strengthen the Companys disclosure controls and procedures in this area. See Item 4 Controls and Procedures in Part I of this report.</i><p>It's interesting to note that the SEC issued guidelines on the reporting of security breaches on October 13th, 2011 ( <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/cfguidance-topic2.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/cfguidance-top...</a> ) and VeriSign's SEC filing was released about two weeks later on October 28th, 2011.  It could be the case that the security breach wasn't actually a major one, but because the SEC guidelines were so new they thought it prudent to mention even a minor security breach.<p>From this filing, there's no way to know the severity of the breach, which is why I think it's unfair for reuters to make this seem like a bigger deal than it might actually be.  (They mention the RSA security breach which <i>was</i> a huge deal, and they suggest the attack was done by a ""nation-state"".)  It reads like an article written by Nancy Grace.<p>Of course it <i>could</i> be the case that this was a major attack carried out by China, but it could also be a mundane attack on a public web server that wouldn't have made the news if not for the timing of the recent SEC guidelines.

3544092,comment,3542490,3543876,5,0,tytso,,,"His performance improvements are very specific to XFS; arguably they were fixing a problem/fundamental design issue in the original journaling code in XFS.  Ext4's journaling code is very, very different from XFS.  So a design improvement that applies to XFS is not necessarily applicable to ext4.  That being said, there have been times when we've looked at what XFS has done with some feature (such as delayed allocation writeback for example) and written code which has been inspired by XFS's algorithms.  I'm an engineer, I'll take good ideas from wherever I can.  (Unless I suspect there may be legal reasons why I had better stay away from certain techniques :-/)<p>Also, the scalability issues that Dave has been talking about aren't ones that matter for any of the workloads that the ext4 developers or their employers care about.  We don't have 32 CPU cores all writing small files and requiring small block allocations to a single file system at the same time.   So yes, there are scalability problems which he has identified with that specific benchmark that Dave was experimenting with (fs_mark) where ext4 has its own performance problems that could be fixed with the appropriate developer attention.   It's on my list to look at and hopefully address, but I have higher priority things that do benefit the workloads that my company is interested in.<p>For example, I am currently working on making Async I/O truly Async even when we need to read metadata blocks, which is a bug that all file systems suffer from under Linux; AIO is not truly ""A"".   This is something that has been known for over a decade, but up until now, no one who was funding fs development, for ext4 or XFS, has had a workload where this has mattered enough.   When I do fix this, it will be an area where ext4 will have an advantage over XFS.  Will I then trumpet this as the reason why they should switch from XFS to ext4?   Of course not.  Not everyone has a need for true Async I/O.  On the other hand, if ext4 has such a feature, it may appeal to some application writers, probably of various different storage servers or perhaps web servers, and if they start using it, then there may be more workloads where true AIO is relevant.  And that in turn might inspire XFS developers to add a similar feature.  This is why I've always believed competition is a good thing, and why I've never argued that fs developers should abandon one file system and go work on another file system.  (As Dave has done on the linux-ext4 list, but never mind that.)",1328210789

This implies that vim appeals to minds that desire constant precision, and GUI editors appeal to minds that prefer to vacillate between levels of precision.<p>Decoupled from this is the question of which pattern of thought lends itself to being a better programmer. There is a good argument either way: staying at a very precise level of thought is wonderful when solving problems; and yet it is better to loosen up when figuring out which problems to solve.<p>I tend to take the view that a programmer's actions while programming should ideally be unambiguous, precise, and regular at all times.

ACTA suffocates collaborative creativity and innovation, and less explicitly, but just as gravely threatens free speech through provisions that may lead to Internet access restrictions for the “sake” of combating “imminent violation” of intellectual property laws.

I don't think this makes a material difference however over three years.<p>Some would say this isn't fair because you're not including elastic scaling which AWS supports, however you can't elastically scale with a 3 year commitment.  Further its hard to estimate how much scaling you'll need because that's a highly variable figure.<p>But you can say that you will need to keep some number of servers up and running 24/7 for your service.<p>I think it would be a more perfect comparison to compare AWS's on-demand price to Hetzner with the built in higher performance of the 4S considered as a hot standby for scaling. (I don't know how long it takes Hetzner to provision extras, though I hear its relatively fast.)  Since servers are cheap (at Hetzner, at least) it seems reasonable to have 1 or 2 extra spun up if you really have spiky traffic.<p>Since I'm planning to get a cluster of Hetzner boxes to support a Riak distributed cluster, and each Hetzner box is over provisioned for my needs (if I get a 4S I think they will be way over-provisioned, leaving a lot of headroom for this ""elastic scaling"" issue)...  I think I'll compare the price of the same number of each boxes. (The AWS box has less performance, but I can elastically scale if I need to, and I'll just give the cost of those short term scale-ups to Amazon for free in this example.)  The results may not be a perfect example for whatever others are considering, but it is a reasonable comparison for my purposes. (my service is a big data service, involving a lot of map reduce, requiring a cluster for operational simplicity and reliability as well as the ability to scale to millions of customers.  I don't know if we'll get millions of customers, but one of our closest competitors had millions of customers within a few weeks.)<p>Amortizing the \n4@ m2.4xlarge = 4* $600/month = $2,400 (using the $600 for the reserved instance costs from vladd's example.)<p>4@ Hetzner 4S = $149 Euro setup fee, amortized over 3 years = 4.14 Euro/month Add the 49.58 Euros in hosting = 53.71 euros x 4 servers = 214.87 euros or $282.50 a month.<p>So, for my cluster, AWS is 8.5 times as expensive.<p>I think that $282 per month is a lot easier for a scrappy startup to handle than $2,400 as well.  This brings ""big data"" within the realm of undefended mortals.<p>Many people use AWS for all the extra services that AWS offers. The value of these services is, of course, subjective, as some startups will need them and others won't.  But they all are based on a custom Amazon API which means if you build your architecture across many servers at Amazon you've got a fair amount of lock-in.<p>For me, I'll take the 8.5X reduction in costs, over lock in anyway.

Protect freedom, except when you don't.<p>27.4 - No anonimity on the web:<p><i>the authority to order an online service provider to disclose expeditiously to a right holder \ninformation sufficient to identify a subscriber whose account was allegedly used for infringement</i><p>27.5 - makes breaking DRM, sharing software that circumvents it, sharing files etc., a crime:<p><i>Each Party shall provide adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies against the \ncircumvention of effective technological measures</i><p><i>the offering to the public by marketing of a device or product, including computer \nprograms, or a service, as a means of circumventing an effective technological measure</i><p><i>to remove or alter any electronic rights management information / to distribute, import for distribution, broadcast, communicate, or make available to the public \ncopies of works, performances, or phonograms, knowing that electronic rights management \ninformation has been removed or altered without authority</i><p>--------<p>Now, most of that sounds reasonable.

Only ban access from those IPs that are Tor exits <i>and</i> allow access through to justin.tv.<p>You can query the exit policies of a given exit with TorDNSEL: <a href=""https://www.torproject.org/tordnsel/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.torproject.org/tordnsel/</a><p>I also whipped up a quick script that can be fed a list of Tor exit nodes on STDIN and will spew out a list of exits that aren't allowed to access a given IP:PORT: <a href=""http://gist.github.com/523328"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gist.github.com/523328</a><p>According to that 5/1338 Tor exits have policies that don't allow exits to justin.tv on port 80 (199.9.249.22:80), but e.g. 309/1338 ban exits to irc.freenode.org:6667.<p>That means that justin.tv is needlessly banning ~0.4% of Tor exit nodes, but someone using the same approach with an IRC server is needlessly banning ~23%.

You want your spouse to be ranked high, and the guy you met once at a networking event to be ranked low.<p>* Depending upon interactions with people, you can upvote or downvote them, to change their rank score.

1601819,comment,1601281,1601544,0,0,grellas,,,"Yes, but the <i>obsession</i> with accumulating money can lead to problems.<p>Setting a high target for success and working hard to get there are worthy goals for men and women alike but going through life with a perpetually-agitated constitution because you don't attain a result that puts you in the top-1% wealth bracket (for example) is an almost certain way to find yourself unhappy and discontented as you strive to meet your main life goals.<p>In the midst of the tech bubble, a prominent Valley newspaper ran a feature story in which it interviewed five couples who were each at varying degrees of financial success, from modest to rich. Ironically, it was the rich couple (net worth of approximately $200 million) that was quoted as saying, in response to a question about what they most wanted, ""we want to know what it would be like to be worth a billion dollars.""<p>To me, this sort of mindset can be problematic, and the problem becomes one of loss of perspective. When the accumulation of money becomes in itself an obsessive goal, it comes back to bite because, no matter how much one has, it will never be enough. I don't think this is really an issue about the money itself, either - it involves instead the idea that your very perception of your value as a human being somehow becomes defined by how the ciphers add up, and that ultimately represents a sad loss of perspective because you wind up forever measuring your wealth (and what it brings) with what everybody else has.<p>Money is great when rightly gained and used. So too is ambition and a desire to achieve the ultimate success. It is good to set your goals high. But it is never good to become obsessed about the accumulation of money as an end in itself. Such a goal, even if attained, will sap the life out of anyone who allows money to become his master.<p>This piece was thought-provoking along these lines, though I think flawed in tying to tie all this to feminist themes.

We responded quickly and got back online within an hour, but it didn’t matter; the site went down and our users couldn’t post.<p>On Friday night, our team worked around the clock to move to new data centers, better capable of handling the onslaught. It wasn’t easy. Throughout the weekend we were fixing issues, optimizing the site, some things going smoothly, others less so.<p>Just at the moments we thought the worst was behind us, we’d run up against another challenge. It tested not only our technical abilities, but our stamina, patience, and we lost more than a few hairs in the process.<p>I’m happy to report Posterous is at 100% and better than ever. Switching to a new data center will help us avoid the type of attacks we saw last week, and the new, bigger, beefier servers will speed up the site and increase capacity. We were hit pretty hard, but we’ve come out stronger in the end.<p>While we were certainly frustrated, we know that no one was more frustrated than you. Your website was down, and I humbly apologize for that. Know that throughout these six days, restoring your site and your trust has been our number one priority.<p>At the same time, I have never been prouder of the Posterous team. Garry led the team in the server migration, Vince worked like a mad man until he passed out on his desk, and Jackson helped the community understand the impacts of some pretty technical issues. This week has been all hands on deck, and we had some pretty great hands.<p>We have great plans for the future of Posterous. Our team is stronger than ever, and we are laser focused on developing better ways for you to share your content online. Thank you for believing in us, thank you for trusting us, and thank you for sticking with us through the past six days.<p>--Sachin Agarwal

2.) Power, Success, Prestige, Freedom, etc. are attractive.
3.) We want things that are derivative of such things, even if we consciously believe we want to benefit humanity, think it's, fun etc.<p>Conclusion: The mind has a way of aligning our conscious interests with our subconscious procreative ones.

1601668,comment,1601492,1601492,0,0,akeefer,,,"Very interesting study, if small.<p>My two questions about it.  1) What's the plateau state and the initial fitness level/muscle density?  Many weight-lifters have experienced that after a certain point, they start to plateau and don't gain further muscle density.  Is the plateau point roughly the same for the two styles?  2) How does that correlate to strength?  It's been hypothesized (but I'm not sure if it's been proven) that strength is a combination of muscle density and motor coordination (i.e. neural connections to allow muscle fibers to fire simultaneously), and that lifting heavy actually leads to additional nerve ends that help coordinate those things (or something like that, at least).  So I'd be interested to know how the different lifting programs affected both maximum lifts and the number of reps that can be performed at, say, 70% of that max.",1281722474

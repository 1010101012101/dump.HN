I did and now I wish I waited for 10.6.1.<p>Small bugs are annoying me, i.e. Transmission hangs when closes, Cyberduck won't load my server, Expose randomly shakes windows at times, etc. Apple certainly had me sold on the under-the-hood bells and whistles for the OS, but certain applications don't like to play nice.<p>I imagine an update will be coming out in the next few weeks and solve these initial woes. I guess what I'm trying to say is - why did I need to move from Leopard to Snow Leopard when it was working perfectly fine?<p>Are you frustrated with your results thus far? Am I the only one?",1252457883

When I started school I could read perfectly, yet handwritten notices on the door looked like greek; I had to ask adults to read them.<p>Admittedly, there is a good reason for cyrillic cursive's existance: shapes of printed letters are just not suited for writing them by hand. Whereas in latin most letters can be printed with just one or two pen strokes (even disallowing retracing), cyrillic letters take two or three at minimum. Probably related to the fact that cyrillic mostly developed after printing was invented, and changed by acts of kings and church, while latin had a much longer and gentlier history.",1252457019

The problem is that if I wanted to do a full offline version of Wikipedia (sans media) there are no incremental updates. IIRC, you would have to re-download the whole thing, even for articles with no changes (or minor/insignificant changes). That's what makes the 'on demand' aspect of a 3rd-party offline Wikipedia app the best model from a bandwidth conservation point of view.<p>I agree that Wikipedia could do something like this with at least the text-only portions of the site. I feel that they would run into a lot of legal troubles with the media though. Lots of the media is user-submitted, but things like logos, trademarks, 'fair-use' of copyrighted material could get them into a lot of legal battles if they tried to sell/distribute an offline version.<p>Even with the text portions of the site, I'm sure they would end up with a few lawsuits from large contributors here and there. Even if the lawsuits were frivolous.<p>Even on an official Wikipedia product, you'll have to think about the bandwidth consumption that would happen from these devices phoning home for updates. While it might help them cut down on actual page hits to the site, it might not as people will probably have to access this from a laptop, and would still use the web browser on their cell/smart phone to do a quick lookup on a spur of the moment topic.",1252456887

A fair percentage of the drive is filled with text-only versions of the next 9,000 top articles in the 12 main categories. I'd say 30%, if possible, should be left for user added articles (using a history ranking service for registered users).<p>I'd say a standard version (contained on say a 120GB mini-portable HDD, say iPhone sized, or an equivalently affordable sized drive) should contain the top 5,000 of each category in their entirety and it should be possible to store the rest of the database text-only.<p>A deluxe version (contained on say a 500GB portable HDD) should contain the entirety of Wikipedia, if capable.<p>I think a large part of an offline Wikipedia would require some effort by wikipedia itself to aggregate page visits for thousands of pages.

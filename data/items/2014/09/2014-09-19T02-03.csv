In your case, being self-taught, and remaining self-taught in having a body of knowledge that you&#x27;re always learning is in some ways, as a developer, more relevant than a degree.<p>There are just as many CS devs who think they&#x27;re done learning and stay stuck and don&#x27;t push themselves.

8338789,comment,8335010,8338390,2,0,klodolph,,,"> I suspect these programs have a larger essential &quot;hairiness.&quot; grep only has to search text. But Find in a text editor has to show a progress bar, cancel button, intermediate result count, etc. These features are intimately intertwined with the algorithm itself, and that&#x27;s often hard in FP. Try writing a Haskell function that does text find/replace with live progress reporting. It&#x27;s not easy, and it ends up looking a bit like Java.<p>Ah, I suspect you&#x27;re not familiar with things like conduits/pipes/iteratees/etc.  These allow you to express and compose those kinds of dirty things that you&#x27;re looking for--incremental input/output, progress reporting, etc.  So you could write a text search function, compose it with a progress reporter that reports how quickly it traverses input, and then report the output progressively, and dispose the whole thing at any time.  Haskell&#x27;s type system is fairly awesome at letting you do things like this, enough that people are still discovering neat tricks decades later.",1411095427

8338770,comment,8335570,8337177,1,0,nostrademons,,,"Isn&#x27;t that because stronger companies have more access to a Series A?  I thought the point that&#x27;s being made by other commenters on this article (grellas et al) is that convertible notes are frequently used for bridge financing to keep the company going when they don&#x27;t yet have the product/traction milestones needed to justify a Series A.  In this case, the alternative is going out of business.  It&#x27;s quite possible for the average convertible debt startup to be worse than the average Series A funded startup, and yet for taking that note to be a good move for <i>any one single startup</i> that happens to be in that position.  The averages are bad because it allows more marginal startups to be funded; the specifics are good because it allows more marginal startups to be funded.<p>I suppose one take-away for founders could be to beware the signaling risks of taking convertible debt if you are, in fact, good enough to raise a Series A.  Another might be to do everything possible to get traction before running out of money.  Both of those are fairly well-known already, however.",1411094764

8338764,comment,8335010,8338003,4,0,klodolph,,,"> The big advantage of OO is that it acts as a distillation of how humans think.<p>I would consider this a disadvantage, not an advantage.  Human thoughts are imprecise and carry rich but ambiguous connotations.  The major advances of mathematics in the 19th century (or thereabouts) onward are closely tied to the divorce of notation and natural language.<p>The ancient version of the Pythagorean theorem is something like, &quot;The area of a square whose side is the length of a hypoteneuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the areas of squares whose sides are equal in length to the other two sides.&quot;  A modern version is more like, &quot;Let a, b, c be the lengths of sides of a right triangle, where c is the length of the hypoteneuse.  Then a^2 + b^2 = c^2.&quot;  You can see as time goes on, the text becomes simultaneously clearer, more concise, and more abstract.<p>This is why natural language programming is doomed to failure.  Others have expressed the point better than I do (notably Dijkstra).  But you can look at the examples of how inheritance in class-based OOP systems work and you will get sick just looking at them: examples of Dog inheriting from Animal, and Penguin from Bird (but penguins don&#x27;t fly), et cetera.  The real disadvantage here is that once people start thinking about taxonomy in general (which class-based OOP encourages), you&#x27;re not thinking about programming any more.<p>The difficulty people have with even simple problems like &quot;how do you describe squares and rectangles in a computer program&quot; is another good illustration of how the class-based object-oriented system of thinking is unsuited for solving computational tasks, at least compared to the alternatives.",1411094635

It was great stylistically and a joy to read save the abhorrent biblical reference and the postface, which seemed grossly wrong to me in asserting that the writer is proposing humanity move forward with &quot;complete knowledge&quot;, whatever that is. Where they found that idea, I don&#x27;t know.<p>This piece of writing to me demonstrates the sense of common curiosity and intellectual inquiry that can frequently be found in 19th and early 20th century writings. To join with the writer along a series of discoveries about a subject, combining both practical and aesthetic observations, is really something rarer today: post-industrial, post-war, post-modern English with its emphasis on efficiency, function, and commerce (ie. mass-market appeal ... in a sea of predominantly television-affected, often non-native readers) seems to have lost this. And all the more to draw it finally in to a higher point! Clearly, a manner of elucidation far too obtuse for a modern readship.<p>It probably had additional appeal to me as growing up in suburban Sydney a family of French puppeteers moved in next door to us, fresh from Polynesia. Living for most of the last decade and a half in Asia, I frequently see puppets in both the shadow and water incarnations, and have begun to collect close up photographs of them wherever I can.

Your answer should be the most comical, borderline embarrassing answer, because it will fulfill the possibly momentary psychological desire of the interviewer to feel they are right. But it should also be an answer that indirectly embarrasses the interviewer too for having asked it. You could say Java 1.7 would have caused the least trouble, and then point out that e.g. if you missed next week&#x27;s release the company would have lost it&#x27;s number one customer and shut down.<p>Plus, if what the interviewer wants is to show off superiority, let them. If you do that, you get the job. The interviewer isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad person, and they might realize how stupidly they acted and shapen up. (Of course don&#x27;t work there if they don&#x27;t.) The more general advice is don&#x27;t oppose forces, for the same reason trees let themselves bend when it&#x27;s windy.<p>If you are unsure or feel cornered over silly stuff, say &quot;I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s the biggest problem to solve, or the one that will generate the most value for the company.&quot; If you have ideas of what that is, then go on to describe them.<p>In short, push back.<p>But <i>don&#x27;t</i> push back the way a suit pushes back with some general, phony sounding, evasive statement like &quot;well, I don&#x27;t know how that affects some of the stakeholders.&quot; Be <i>specific</i>.<p>(Don&#x27;t think of pushing back as doing something bad. Think of it as being more open-minded than the other person. You are considering data they are neglecting. It&#x27;s part of being a good designer. Corollary: make an effort to consider other people&#x27;s ideas, else you&#x27;ll be the one who is narrow-minded.)<p>If I had only one piece of advice it would be: focus on the root of the problem. Hint: more often than not it&#x27;s not what it appears to be, but it&#x27;s some other problem hidden five layers deep.<p>For example, if an aggressive interviewer says &quot;Clearly you don&#x27;t know how to code and are useless&quot;, then clearly the problem is the interviewer, and the way you can pass the interview is to tell the truth. That he is the problem. But -- to do it indirectly, with humor as a lubricant. Start from the very first word: &quot;clearly&quot;. Don&#x27;t give them an inch.<p>You say something along the lines of: &quot;Well, it&#x27;s dangerous to make absolute statements, you know, to say &quot;clearly&quot;, or &quot;always&quot; or &quot;never&quot;. Not just because there&#x27;s always a chance one could be wrong, but mostly because I noticed with myself that when I do that it&#x27;s often to counteract something I subconsciously know is true. Else I wouldn&#x27;t be finding the need to try hard to qualify what I say. I&#x27;d just say it. And you know what, I regret it eventually. It&#x27;s strange how the subconscious works. I keep being surprised at how things aren&#x27;t always as they seem. But I&#x27;m willing to learn.&quot;<p>In this way you address the root of the problem: the interviewer is aggressive without even realizing it. You identify how one can tell they are acting in ways they haven&#x27;t realized: by making absolute statements. You show humility: you explain this is something that happened to you before. You allow for the interviewer to feel superior: because you just explained a mistake you made.

Strings are one, but monads aren&#x27;t applicative functors, it took us a long time to figure out how we wanted to write monad transformers, lazy I/O is terrible and we should use conduits or whatever instead.  But you picked strings.  This example does not help your point for the following reasons:<p>1. You can&#x27;t just change the implementation of the string type without messing up someone&#x27;s program.  For a fantastic example, look at the recent change to Oracle&#x27;s string type in Java.  In theory, the interface is the same.  In practice, it made a bunch of people mad.<p>2. You can encapsulate data in Haskell.  Look at the &quot;Text&quot; data type, and ignore Text.Unsafe which exposes the gory innards.  This is module level encapsulation, which is just as good as class-level encapsulation (better, actually, since it&#x27;s more flexible).  You could replace Text with a UTF-8 implementation or a UTF-32 implementation or some magic implementation that switches between the types, and you wouldn&#x27;t break consumers of the Text interface.<p>> For example, try modifying a Haskell program to print a log every time a string is made. You can&#x27;t!<p>This is a really contrived example.  First of all, there is the question of whether you will need to create a string whenever you log something to a file, and presumably you wouldn&#x27;t want to log those strings.  Second, this is something you&#x27;d do with a debugger, you wouldn&#x27;t actually do this to a program.<p>Besides, if you had access to the string implementation (which I&#x27;m assuming here is Text, because that&#x27;s what most people use), you could just put some kind of unsafePerformIO call in front of uses of the Text constructor, and since the Text constructor isn&#x27;t exported from the Text module, you&#x27;re done.",1411093552

How do you have all this investment capital? Is it mom and dad&#x27;s money?<p>(6) You don&#x27;t have a business model or plan. Your company Blogging.org looks like a lifestyle business. According to Crunchbase you have one employee. You. I&#x27;d love to see your business plan.<p>(7) Evidence that the startup will earn money is scant. See above.<p>(8) I don&#x27;t believe you can build your product. Did you hire a guy in India to build Blogging.org over a weekend?<p>(9) Your company is not the first to enter the market or unique. Dude, you started a how-to affiliate marketing site. Talk about follow the leader!<p>(10) The founder or CEO is uncoachable. I find you repugnant.<p>(11) Your startup costs too much. Talk to Josh at First Round for their thoughts on Twitter&#x27;s valuation (they didn&#x27;t invest) or Mark Suster on Uber, or Peter Thiel on the Facebook Series B. But you probably know better than them oh wise one.<p>(12) You handle rejection poorly. Let&#x27;s see how you react to this post.<p>(13) You cold-called me. Douche. Let&#x27;s not pretend that you&#x27;re Marc Andreessen here. You haven&#x27;t earned the Glengarry leads yet.

Focus!!!!!<p>(16) You’re way too early for my money. Oh ya, because Uber was kicking down your door on their Series A. Dude, you need to earn respect (and work your ass off for it).

I don&#x27;t think R&D departments have the incentive entrepreneurs have in actually making research useful. Google X stands out as different, and I think that&#x27;s because Google seems to be using it for marketing as much as research. We&#x27;ve yet to see any game changers come out of there, unless you think Google Glass was a success. The self-driving automobiles are interesting and will probably lead to something, and the air drones too. It&#x27;s probably not all a wash.",1411092004

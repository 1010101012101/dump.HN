Compression and cache locality would still require a lot of changes to be made on lower layers. I think there is ample scope for a DB Engine that allows some tables to be column stores when required.<p>It is also noted in one of the papers (I forgot which one) that Column stores work better for read intensive use cases, probably because disk seeks would be less (appends/changes to one one section of a table and not 5 sections)",1327856355

3525485,comment,3524819,3525386,2,0,japhyr,,,"I think this hasn't been done well because it is more difficult than creating something like wikipedia.  One of the reasons wpedia works is because you can enforce a non-redundancy policy.  There can only be one article on any one topic.  In education, however, there are many ways to teach any one concept.  So you have to allow people to create different lessons on the same topic, but also create a simple pathway through all these lessons.  Khan academy has been successful in this for math, but I think a good part of that is because there is one person clearly running the show, an intensely productive man who spits out several videos a day, for years.  Crowdsourcing that work is an interesting challenge.<p>As a teacher, I'd love to see this done well.  But it seems most people who go into these ventures either don't get education, or don't get technology.  It seems there is a pretty small group of people in the world who really get both fields.  It's also hard to put together a team of people who get both.  And finally, the profit motive kills a lot of education endeavors.  Education is fundamentally a human right, and profit motives tend to exaggerate the achievement gap.  There is plenty of room for new thinking in this area.",1327855310

(Forcing it results in crap articles)<p>Don't go setting any schedule or minimum number of posts per month or anything, that will just make it feel like a chore.<p>I would try and let the focus develop over time, it will probably mirror the way your general interests in life focus over time. And don't worry if you write a post every now and then that doesn't rigidly fit that focus.<p>Don't push for it. My employer gives me 8 hours per day to do productive stuff, and my family demands a chunk of my free time. In fact I don't put blogging in that same category as ""things I have to do"". For me it is an alternative to drinking or watching tv. A chance to wind down, unload some thoughts etc.<p>Ahh I see you use reading and writing articles and conference papers as alternatives. I think if doing those things were part of my life I wouldn't feel like blogging nearly as much.\n Why blog if you already have an audience for the same thing through other channels? How would you feel about giving up those other channels, and putting all that content on your blog instead? (I am not suggesting that, but the question might make you think about whether blogging is for you, or whether you could maybe divide the content up into the different channels). Actually, blogging is a lot less formal. When I was a student I had to write papers on the same topics I now blog about, but all the formality made it a drag, finding references, worrying about unwittingly plagiarizing something, making sure it is of ""academic quality"" (i.e. only facts, no opinions) just really messed up my flow, and made it a total drag.

3525429,comment,3522537,3522537,2,0,davesims,,,"To me the problem of estimation is fairly straightforward. Mike Cohn's work in AEAP is thorough and worthwhile and probably still the best resource for solving the problem of estimation with any regularity.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Estimating-Planning-Mike-Cohn/dp/0131479415"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Estimating-Planning-Mike-Cohn/dp...</a><p>But the simple version of the problem, in my experience, is related to the 80/20 rule. No matter how many times a developer goes through the process of estimation -> development -> slippage, whether on a big scope or small, we will inevitably estimate the very next project as if only the clean 80% exists and the 20% will magically disappear <i>this time</i>.<p>Let's back up. In my experience the 80/20 rule (or Pareto Principle) applied to software estimation means that you will spend 80% of your time writing 20% of your features. Usually this has to do with various technical blocks, edge cases, framework incompatibilities -- the list goes on and varies wildly from one feature or application to the next.<p>You will spend 20% of your time working on 80% of the feature(s). This is the stuff you have done before: basic CRUD, ORM-fu, REST actions -- these are the clean, easily understood software tasks that you see right in front of you as the happy yellow brick road to feature completion.<p>And no matter how many times we wash-rinse-and-repeat this cycle, the next time a PM or colleague asks us ""how long this will take,"" we will stare at that beautiful, pristine part of the path that we understand and know and have done before, and conveniently elide the fact that our development process has never been that clean and there is a nasty 20% (what? my code won't connect to the staging server because of some weird certificate problem? what do you mean my gems are incompatible? I can't get 'make' to build this gcc lib!! IE is doing what??

Most communications satellites will be a much higher altitude.<p>While there is no fundamental reason why governments couldn't create ASAT weapons to reach higher altitudes, the costs go on significantly. Previous (like cold war era) attempts at high altitude weapons pretty much just strapped a big nuke to a full out launch vehicle. For reference, the weapon used by the US in their ASAT kill in 2006 was made using a modified ballistic defense missile (the SM-3). Your Aegis equipped warships can carry a -lot- of them.<p>Anyhow, it'd be far easier for governments to attempt to regulate the receivers and transmitters than to shoot down the satellite.

They are one of the few, if not the only, operator that very thoroughly specifies both the network side and the terminal side of their network. They have a large R&D department that is very competent and actively engaged in standardization and development of new technologies. For instance, they were one of the drivers behind LTE from the very start.<p>For them, it must be hard to no longer own the terminals on their network fully. I suppose they had to start offering Android terminals since their own smartphones were not competitive compared to the Iphone and Android.<p>But without any control of the terminals' behavior it's very hard to tune and operate a cellular network. It's not so easy to increase capacity, since there's only so much spectrum available for use and the modern wireless technologies can't get much more efficient. Especially in crowded locations like downtown Tokyo the base stations are already about as close as you can have them. It's not something you can just throw money at to solve.<p>So it's a tough problem.

2565052,comment,2562723,2562913,2,0,jsavimbi,,,"If taken from the context that the un-technical co-founder will be conceptualizing, if not creating, the product UI itself, then yes, by all means, this person should get out of their comfort zone and gather as much knowledge and learn as many toolsets as they can and in order to at least be able to transfer their ideas into a visual system of sorts until someone with the appropriate expertise comes around and implements their vision.<p>Depending on the level of investment that a company is putting into their UX, then maybe this approach makes sense if you're going to be trolling the Craigslists looking for a student who needs to pimp out their portfolio in exchange for a hot meal, but in all seriousness, treating UX like some low-hanging fruit that a business person is going to pick up after a couple of Frontpage tutorials is ludicrous, not to mention downright insulting to anyone who practices the craft. I believe the same applies to anyone who works in the middle-tier or back-end. If the non-technical co-founder is smart enough to partner themselves with a technical person whom they can trust to make the right technical decisions while sharing responsibility for the costs, then they won't need to be poking around in the details trying to micromanage something they have no inkling of understanding, never mind actually designing, developing, deploying, maintaining, troubleshooting or fixing should everything go south.<p>I'll go back to my original premise: learn to communicate well in English, both in spoken and written form.<p>A person who can master that will be at an advantage of selling the company's product, services or team to any client, partner, potential employee or investor over someone who cannot speak publicly, has grammar issues and spends their time fucking around with powerpoint-related technologies. Effective communication starts with language, not toolsets, in my most humble opinion.",1305831521

2565043,comment,2564543,2564693,7,0,jacobian,,,"I was thinking of two specific instances (luckily this sort of crap is rare and it's only happened to me those two times).<p>In the first instance, the person in question was my direct boss and was responsible for reviewing my code. He'd routinely call me an idiot, a retard, etc., and during meetings he'd often say things like ""no, we can't give that to Jacob - he'll just fuck it up."" Now, in his defense I <i>was</i> a pretty shitty developer at the time, but I do believe there are more constructive ways of reviewing code than calling the author a retard. I dealt with it for a few months, and finally asked his boss to transfer one of us. When I explained the reasons, this person was fired.<p>In the second case, my coworker was showing up to work drunk, yelling and cursing at coworkers, and routinely threatened violence -- ""I'm gonna beat your ass if you don't shut the fuck up"" was, I believe, a common line. Once he threw a chair through a window halfway through a (technical) meeting. Again I was too much of a coward to call him on his behavior directly, but yes I spoke to first my boss, then his, then the owner of the company. Nothing changed, so ultimately I quit.<p>In retrospect I certainly didn't behave perfectly: I should have confronted the behavior directly, and I should have made clear what my expectations were with regard to a professional working environment. But I was young, and all in all I'm proud of myself for not tolerating abuse (even if I didn't go about it quite right).",1305831384

The best option for any one party is to settle (regardless of what others do), but the best overall result would be for nobody to settle.<p>One solution to the prisoner's dilemma is for everyone to get together and give up the ability to defect, say by incorporating it into corporate bylaws.  Another is to drastically change the cost structure, such as by insurance or a mutual contract that holds anyone who settles liable for a large amount.

Erlang can't use it out-of-the-box but conceptually it could be modelled as a port, though again whether you could get a performance win I don't know. Mono and the JVM could use it, though again, primitive threading story.

You're doomed to a death of a thousand cuts if you play along with patent trolls, even if each cut is comparatively small.<p>Clearly ""let's cooperate and put trolls out of business"" isn't happening right now, and other than the possibility that no one has thought of it before now (doubtful) there are two obvious reasons:<p>- For a given case where a troll sues multiple parties, each party is relying on the other defendants to cooperate, but the lowest risk alternative is to settle early and be done with it. The patent troll knows this, and will try to cut down the number of cooperators until all are forced to settle.<p>- Since most cases don't offer much resistance and often settle, patent trolls are able to fund an expansion of their operations, and they simultaneously gain credibility (""you'd better settle, Microsoft already did"").<p>So the historical practice of settling with trolls works against companies who would think not to do so, and any group of companies that tries to band together in defense is in a situation where defection ruins the defense, and the incentive to defect starts high and increases with each additional defection.<p>As Mr. Crutchfield says, it's a shakedown that exploits a peculiarity of the patent system (namely, the combination of the ability to sell patents with the ability for NPEs to bring infringement suits).

If the price drops below the initial sale value, then $45 today will definitely seem expensive to people buying it 90 days from now. But I don't see where it would mean that the company made a mistake in the initial offer of $45/share - in fact, wouldn't it look like the company got a good deal, in selling the initial shares at above-market-values (in 90 days from now)?",1305829362

Unlike with other oppressed groups, children eventually grow out of it, with no effort required on their own part.  There isn't time for hopelessness and resentment to bubble over into an actual movement for change, because the people mostly likely to lead such a movement (teenagers aged 14-18) will be able to vote in 4 years anyway.<p>But it's worth remembering that this is <i>not</i> fair, it's <i>not</i> just, and it's ultimately bad for American democracy.  Do you think our public school system would be in such a shitty state if children could vote?  How about the national debt, which is a transfer of wealth from current generations to future generations?  Maybe we would've fixed social security had the generation most likely to get screwed by it actually had voting power?<p>Seniors often have mental capacities that are not much better than children (Florida 2000, anyone?), yet the AARP is a massive political force, and seniors turn out to vote in disproportionate numbers.

Often as you work in remote or even disaster areas, roads stop or are blocked.  With the Maverick you pop up the sail and fly over the problem or take the shorter straight route.  It does take about 10 minutes or less to get ready to fly.  Can take off in 150 feet but 300 is advised for takeoff and landing, which is significantly less normal small planes.<p>It is designed so that ""everyday"" people can fly it, because the sail it is inherently more stable than a fixed wing aircraft.  It has a steering wheel that you turn right it goes right.  To go higher give it more gas to go lower give it less gas.  No ailerons, flaps, rudder or elevator, it uses warping of the sail to turn.<p>If you guys have questions about ITEC or the Maverick I would be happy to answer them.  BTW I have not flown in it yet, they only have the one proto-type and three more are in production.  But I have gone 92mph on the ground and it can easily take my Corvette.<p>Doug at itecusa.org",1305829206

Without worrying about keeping a driver alive (and conscious), the cars would be substantially faster. They also talked about how physically demanding driving an F1 car is, and how a driver is basically an athlete in prime condition. In keeping their heads upright through turns they develop some ridiculous muscle in their necks. There's a funny video on youtube of an F1 driver crushing a walnut with his neck.",1305828138

You misunderstand the intent of my post though.<p>First, as a small point, I was not seriously suggesting using thread pools to implement mlock_eventfd. That's just a way that we could play around with it short of a kernel implementation, which would probably be more efficient.<p>Second, I don't think I'm dogmatic about mmap. It's just a cool interface that would be nice to see more widely used, and I was suggesting that it might be more usable with a small addition. Commenters here, at my blog and on Reddit have pointed out other problems, and I'm happy to learn about these. If mmap isn't good and we should keep using DIO, then I think there are still possible improvements that we could make to the interface to allow better cooperation with the kernel.",1305828115

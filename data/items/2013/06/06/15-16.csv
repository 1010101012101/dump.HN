I've been making decent progress but would like to set up a group for any other like minded people to go through the book with me.<p>I'm pretty flexible - thinking the pace should be a chapter a month? (if that's too fast or slow for you I'll switch it up) I just want to go over the information with other people and have resources in case I can't figure out an exercise or part of the book.<p>My email should be in my profile, or post here. I'll be checking back frequently.<p>Also if anyone who has worked through SICP has any advice any wants to share I'm happy to listen or if you want to go through the book again for a refresher (or because you enjoyed it a lot) join up!<p>Thanks!",1370534392

I find it hard to believe it is the only option, tbh, and you provide no evidence --nor I have evidence to support that it is not. But, could it be that the problem is that the US citizens have no (effectively possible) way to effect power on the government? Could it be that with a two party system there is little incentive to cater to the constituents? Could it be that there is little incentive for Democrats to be anything other than a little to the left of the Republicans, and that there is little incentive for Republicans to be other than not Democrats? ...

5833165,comment,5831491,5831491,74,0,sologoub,,,"This article seems to be missing a parallel that was drawn previously many times. PG has written on the subject, and so have others.<p>The closest parallel we can draw between ""coders"" and the distant past, is that with the artisans of the middle ages. Aside from the landowning nobles, the artisan class was probably the closest thing to a true middle class. Many advanced to upper-middle and later became the industrial nuevo rich.<p>The reason that this parallel works, is that the artisans were able to make something coveted out of what looked like a pile of junk (or less usable) to others. What a software developer creates with a few keystrokes looks to the lay person now as ""magical"" as creating a sword out of a pile of rocks looked to a lay person a thousand years ago. They get the general concept and see the value, but they have no idea of how it actually happened and cannot repeat it themselves.<p>By today's standards, most of what artisans of old made is not very desirable if it is made today (antiques not withstanding), hence only very few ""artists"" are actually paid well. Most people engaged in artisanal work are now in what we call 3rd world countries and make zilch. The reason behind this, is that technology has progressed and most of this stuff can be made faster, cheaper and more consistent by a manufacturing process. Today, we can take the best artisan of old, and copy him/her a million times over to produce the same trinket, with little extra expense.<p>Software engineering has not yet gone through a true manufacturing disruption. We cannot put software on the kind of assembly line/stamping process we can with say door hinges or other metal works that used to require a skilled blacksmith. That doesn't mean it won't happen some day.<p>We are constantly trying to go the direction of commoditizing complex problems. Looking back 30-40 years, the efficiency of tools we use has gone way up. Today, a developer doesn't have to write many components from scratch (unless he or she wants to). Most of what makes an application can be taken of the shelf, and modified to fit. For consumer apps, design is also where a lot of work goes in to.<p>This modification or molding process is a major barrier to having a true manufacturing process in place because the quality of the modifications depends on the individual skill of the person making it. A mistake made early on can bring a future company to it's knees and derail projects years after it was made. For example, a faulty data model that is let to grow to terabytes of information. Many companies choose to through money and computing resources, rather than risk a costly migration.<p>When we have sufficiently advanced to the point where such mistakes do not depend on an individual and the automation process can take care of it, the value of the software engineer as we know the profession today will diminish greatly. But then again, I'm sure the profession will evolve as well.",1370534037

Emulate some of the stylistic choices to improve your documentation.<p>3.) Make a Show HN. Or, whenever your software can help a situation you notice in the comments here, promote it. Don't be afraid to do this, because this promotion is absolutely necessary.<p>4.) Post to the subreddit of the language that your software is for, but don't be commercial about it. You have to be honest. So write like you're talking to a friend. This is easier if you're talking out loud as you write.<p>==============<p>Doing these things will add eyes to your projects. People can see your nicely documented code, see your screenshots, and can imagine how this will help their coding. This is GOOD.

Add your blog to any relevant blog directories.  Share your entries in relevant sub-reddits, or here on HN, or wherever makes sense relative to your content.  Share posts on G+ and, again, use relevant hashtags.  If you're feeling ambitious, find other bloggers who cover a similar area, and email them and talk about writing a guest post for them.  See if you can get somebody who is at least a ""mini celebrity"" to write a guest post for <i>your</i> blog.  Record podcasts, screencasts and/or video blogs.  Share the screencast / video blog posts through Youtube.  Join relevant LinkedIn groups and share your blog posts with the group.

In other words, it's an arbitrage - they're taking the long-term risk of a yearly lease and gaining the short term reward of nightly rentals by tourists, for which there is strong demand, and which results in fewer hotel bookings and fewer apartments available for local residents.<p>And, fairly enough, it also puts that arbitrage profit into the hands of the apartment renter, not the landlord, who took the risk of putting the building up (or managing it) in the first place.<p>So hotels lose, landlords lose, NYC housing consumers lose, and tourists gain and AirBNB hosts gain. Fine.<p>SO:  Rather than making it outright illegal, why not balance out some of the incentives in the name of efficiency?  Hosts SHOULD be able to rent out their place when they don't live there (improved efficiency) or rent out a spare room in a multi-room apartment (also improved efficiency), but maybe limit the amount that can be charged to a proportion of rent they themselves pay?  If it stops becoming a profit center then you remove the big incentive that ""pros"" are going for -- sopping up available units and using them solely for tourists. If my lease for an apartment is $3000/month, the max I'd be allowed to charge is $100/night.<p>It would change the dynamics quite a bit -- now there's zero incentive for a ""pro"" or landlord to go rent dozens of otherwise available apartmens to use for tourists. In fact, the landlord would go right back to preferring long-term lessors. Rather get an easy, single check per month than dozens of small and unguaranteed checks.<p>It would remove the profit incentive of regular hosts but still allow the rent-offset incentive.<p>However, it would make WORSE the imbalance between AirBNB and hotels, and demand for airbnb would increase (and supply would decrease because of fewer hosts).  That said, it's not a bad thing. It would be real competition for hotels, and rightfully so -- that's AirBNB's job and the disruption they're causing. And more competition and lower prices for everyone is a Good Thing.<p>I'm sure I'm missing some untended consequences here, but perhaps it's a start...",1370533682

Funds could be set aside for the promotion of general welfare and businesses/policies could be established that would be able to operate as federally owned businesses (in which federally owned is a far more efficient outcome than federally run).<p>The federal government seems to have forgotten about their past successes, or have forgotten that too often, their over-involvement has led to failures like the USPS, so I'm wary of new government enterprises subject to all the inefficiencies of Congress (Affordable Care Act being a prime example), which doesn't necessarily mean that I'm against the premise of health care for all, but says that letting that be a government-run enterprise is the least efficient way to get there.<p>Getting to federally owned instead of federally run is another way to get to your stated position, as, so long as we're able to keep political appointees away from the helm of these businesses, they'll be run by competent staff, and be able to fairly compete in the free market as equal competitors to that market, which will help prevent collusive policies, crony capitalism and the like from predatory cost inflation on things like health care.",1370533388

5833081,comment,5832710,5832710,4,0,mindcrime,,,"There's no question that networks help, although I guess you could quibble over whether it's ""unfair"" or not.  But what comes up here on HN sometimes - and this is one place I disagree with michaelochurch - is the issue of gaining access to certain networks or individuals.  I think MOC and some others feel like you're largely ""in or out"" now and forever, and that you can't find a way to forge a bridge into a network (say, local VC's) that you aren't already part of.   I have not found this to be the case, at least here in the Raleigh / Durham, NC area.<p>Now, truth be told, if you're somebody ""important"" like a VC or a well known angel investor, you might not be seeking out ""common people"" to pull into your orbit, and when you're in a position where a lot of people are coming to you wanting something, you probably learn to be a bit more guarded and put up some filters.  This may not be completely unlike the way some very attractive women put up what guys sometimes call a ""bitch shield"" when they get tired of getting hit on all the time.<p>But, at the same time, these people are human, and they are social creatures, and they ultimately <i>need</i> the people with good ideas and startups, just as much as they are needed in turn.  And if you take the time to learn how they work, where they hang out, what events to attend, and you trawl your existing network and ask for connections, etc., you can  reach a point where your network includes VC's, or angels, or CEO's of companies, or pretty much whatever.  Treat people like people, not like caricatured images, ask politely for their assistance with something, demonstrate that you represent (at least potentially) some value to them, and most people will reciprocate, and the relationship can grow slowly over time.  It is almost like dating in a sense.<p>Now what you can't necessarily do is develop a network of ""all my Stanford alumnus friends"" if you didn't attend Stanford, or whatever.  But you <i>can</i> build a network of the kind of people you need to have relationships with...  if it's hotshot engineers you feel like you need to connect with, go to the local LUG and JUG meetings, Perl Mongers meeting, Ruby Brigade meetings, Javascript meetups, Hadoop User's Group meetings, etc.   And, like mentioned in TFA, start establishing your credibility in your field by blogging, tweeting, speaking publicly (speak at the aforementioned LUG, JUG, HUG, etc. meetings, for example) and other active steps.  Write a book if you have to; self-publish on Lulu.com if you want to, and get an ISBN so it will be available on Amazon.com and via special order at retail book shops.<p>None of this stuff is <i>easy</i> but it's doable.  Trust me, I know.  I was the ""country bumpkin"" guy who grew up in Redneckville, NC, far away from anything or anybody technical, and after I moved to the RTP area, I did pretty much everything I just said (minus writing a book, which I'd still like to do, but don't have time right now).   And while I'm not the most connected person in the world, I know many of the local VC's and angels, have friends who are VP's, CEO's, etc. of companies, and have a broad network of talented technical people that I have relationships with.  It has taken work and taken time (and the journey isn't over) but you can ""network up"" with some effort in my experience.<p>Edit: Oh yeah, another thing you can do, although I really don't recommend this as purely an exercise in network building / PR:  Run for public office.  It varies by state, but here in NC, you can run for a statewide office, like, for example, Lieutenant Governor, just by filing some paperwork and paying the fee and - depending on whether you are associated with a party or not, and that party's status, possibly doing some petitioning.  If you run as a Republican or Democrat, you will likely have a primary against the other members of that party who file for the same office.  If you run as a 3rd party, like Libertarian, you're likely to be unopposed in the primary phase and will automatically go straight to the ballot in the general election.   Anyway, once you file, you'll start getting surveys to fill out and invites to various candidate forums and events.  Go to them and speak.<p>I did this (running for NC Lieutenant Governor as a Libertarian) and got about 126,000 votes, so at least a few people have heard my name out there.  But, again, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this just as a way to network.  Yeah, you'll meet a lot of people, and you will get a little bit of media coverage (even as a 3rd party unknown, the media don't <i>totally</i> exclude you, they just <i>mostly</i> exclude you) and you might even be on TV in a debate.  But whether or not the people you meet doing this will help your later career or initiatives (unless you really <i>want</i> to be a politician) is subject to debate.  And more than a few of the people you meet will automatically put you in the ""enemy"" bucket just due to party affiliation, so it could actually hurt you down the road.  And you probably won't even know if it happens.",1370533349

I use the caveat because there are several ways to interpret it, assuming it is real. (It looks real.)<p>A few definitions: to ""collect"" means to gather and store; to ""analyze"" means that a computer or human actually does something with the records; to ""intercept"" means that a computer or human actually listens to or records calls.<p>...\nThe NSA, under the FISA Amendments Act, is able to analyze metadata, like incoming and outgoing call records, so long as the Attorney General certifies that a particular set of information is useful for reasons of national security. Then, the NSA asks the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to order that a company comply. As that bill was being ironed out, this step was requested by private companies because they wanted protection from lawsuits in case innocents  or millions of innocents  found that the NSA had gathered their call information.<p>My own understanding is that the NSA routinely collects millions of domestic-to-domestic phone records. It does not do anything with them unless there is a need to search through them for lawful purposes. That is, an analyst at the NSA cannot legally simply perform random searches through the stored data. He or she needs to have a reason, usually some intelligence tip. That would allow him or her to segregate the part of the data that's necessary to analyze, and proceed from there.<p>In a way, it makes sense for the NSA to collect all telephone records because it can't know in advance what sections or slices it might need in the future. It does not follow that simply because the NSA collects data that it is legal for the NSA to use the data for foreign intelligence or counter-terrorism analysis.</i><p><a href=""http://theweek.com/article/index/245228/the-fbi-collects-all-telephone-records"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theweek.com/article/index/245228/the-fbi-collects-all...</a><p>This is written specifically about the telephone call metadata, but being able to differentiate exactly what is collected about Internet traffic would also aid this discussion.

5833032,comment,5830219,5831275,1,0,davesims,,,"I've been a part-time cultural critic for...a long time, and I couldn't agree more. I've always tried to do two things with my essays: make them as creative works in their own right, and always recognize the subordinate nature of criticism. This both makes me sympathetic to the artist (as someone who in a lesser way is presenting a work of my own) and also less prone to taking the all-too-common Superior Stance of the critic.<p>If a work is particularly bad, I'll generally just leave it alone, unless the artist has presented something that is <i>obviously</i> cynical and pandering, or otherwise <i>obviously</i> derivative and parasitic on the work of better artists. In those cases I might get <i>slightly</i> snarky. I try to control this and tone it down, because even derivative works are risks, and usually somewhat naive.<p>If the artists' ambitious goals weren't met, and I think I understand them, I try to lay this out in as constructive a manner as I can.<p>I can usually only accomplish good criticism by immersion -- repeated (dozens of) listens to a record for instance, over a period of days, writing/typing out lyrics by hand, listening to all the artist's previous records, reading as many interviews as I can and just trying to get my head in the ""space"" of the record. At some point I get to a place of sympathy where I get into the ""soul"" of the record and I really have something to say, that isn't just a first impression, nor a knee-jerk reaction, but as close to deep understanding as I can get. It's <i>really</i> hard work, even for just a 150 word review (which is one reason I don't do it often any more).<p>It's rare to get <i>that</i> kind of perspective on a HN comment, ""Show HN"", or some blog post linked here. But even with the noise that's emerged over the last few years as HN has grown, I can still find the really constructive comments and learn as much as I always have. I just have to look past the frustrating drive-by comments, the throw-away accounts and the axes-to-grind. The signal-to-noise isn't what it used to be, but in general there's just as much signal, but a lot more noise to have to overlook.",1370532725

5832959,comment,5830633,5832379,4,0,robomartin,,,"> The net, basically, is that privacy is nobody's 'hot-button' issue because even while somebody can espouse the inherent ignorance of the ""If you have nothing to hide..."" argument, we, for the most part, don't have anything to hide. So while we don't acquiesce to these intrusions of privacy, we let them fall by the wayside in the wake of more important issues<p>Perfectly stated.  Not sure what the solution might be other than removing layers of influence from politicians hands.  What should they really be doing?<p>Perhaps we ought to hyper-compartmentalize their jobs.  Te US Constitution is great, but it was written centuries ago.  C'mon folks, a lot of it does not align with modern reality.<p>For example, healthcare laws ought to be in the hands of a team with relevant domain expertise.  Why are we allowing ignorant representatives to have any say at all?  Why is it that we dump it all on the laps of the Senate and the House.  Most of those people are lawyers.  Patent law is an example of the shit they can create.  The House?  Holy shit!  Have you seen the kind of people who land those jobs?  Why do they have so much power?<p>Te problem you allude to would be resolved if we divided-up decision making along domains.  Now you can publish basic qualifications for each domain and create prerequisites for each position.  Then people, if they care enough, would be able to vote for domain-specific representation.<p>I could then vote for someone who thinks along my lines when it comes to healthcare, gun control, budgets, building bridges, social programs, military spending, etc.  different people, each with less overall power yet far more understanding and command of their chosen domain.<p>I want doctors to set healthcare laws, not lawyers or politicians.  I want engineers and entrepreneurs to create intellectual property laws, not lawyers.  I want qualified financial experts to set fiscal policy, not lawyers, politicians or the President. I want infrastructure experts to manage our infrastructure, not some politician who owes union thugs for their votes.  I don't want unions nearly anywhere and particularly not in education.<p>It simply makes no sense to have the same person have rule-making power over topics ranging from encryption, surveillance and healthcare to education, defense and social concerns.  They can't possibly be good at making decisions in all domains and they keep getting voted into office by catering to large groups behind major causes who they become prostituted to.<p>Perfect? Nope.  Nothing is.",1370532231

Having a service that de facto converts long-term residential housing to hotels seems like the sort of thing the city would object to regardless of the revenue implications.<p>Besides, most of the money that cities get from tourists they get through sales tax or indirectly through property and income taxes on tourist-supported businesses.

Something weird happened in the Bush leadership where we got the traditional conservative laissez-faire policy toward military and the private sector, but also large government/nanny-state policies indicative of Democrats.<p>The result was actually something coming very close to an outright fascism. I know that's one of those words people throw around a lot, but we were coming close to that definition with the level of power the federal government was wielding domestically, and how much power they also gave back to private sectors, doing things like prosecuting citizens criminally for tort offenses.<p>So, no, Bush !== Obama. Obama is actually playing right out of the traditional democrat handbook, but the world has changed, and the New Democrat (TM) is an individual that wants the social freedoms traditional progressives offered without the nanny-state. Obama's losing the NDs in droves.<p>Libertarians keep trying to Co-opt this group, but it's not going to happen. We have a two-party state, and it's statistically infeasible to have anything <i>but</i>. I'd rather morph the group that didn't seat Bush into what I want than try to bootstrap a whole new party.

I got a big ol' whiteboard and wrote down everything I could be doing (project list, todo list, reading list, etc. etc.)  The thing about using a .txt file or a Google Doc is that windows or open tabs can always be ignored, accidentally closed, minimized -- when an entire wall in one of your rooms is devoted to the things you want to be doing, its a lot harder to pretend they don't exist.<p>2. I started working with other people.  I have a standing man-date with one of my friends where every Tuesday night, one of us buys a six-pack and we just plug away on our computer with a new album or something in the background.  I don't know what it is about being around other people that makes me inherently more productive, but I feel like I have a part of my brain that wants to do work and part of my brain that wants to goof off: when I have friends in the room, the goofy hemisphere can spend time cracking jokes and scattered conversations, while the productive hemisphere codes away.

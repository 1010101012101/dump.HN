Companies often have no idea where their parts or materials really come from, although this may often be wilful ignorance. They do seem to have some legal obligation to know where things are coming from[1]. George Monbiot  wrote a couple[2][3] of articles recently about trying to find out where the materials in smartphones are really coming from:<p><i>Of the manufacturers, Nokia appears to have gone furthest, and its efforts are quite impressive. Since 2001  long before most other companies began to take an interest  it has tried to remove illegally mined tantalum from its supply chain. It now instructs its suppliers to map the routes these metals take before they reach the company. The problem is far from solved: it tells me that ""there has been no credible system in the electronics industry that allows a company to determine the source of their material""</i><p><i>Apple's response was less detailed and less persuasive. To give you an idea of how complex the problem has become, it has discovered that its metals are supplied by 211 smelters, liberally distributed around the planet. Any of them could be using minerals seized by militias in Congo.</i><p>As you can probably guess, he ended up not buying a smartphone.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodd_Frank_Act#Disclosures_on_Conflict_Materials_in_or_Near_the_Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodd_Frank_Act#Disclosures_on_...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/mar/11/search-smartphone-soaked-blood"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/mar/11/search-s...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/25/smartphone-samsung-tin-bangka-island"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/25/smartpho...</a>",1370177703

You have a choice. I have a choice. I used my choice. I razed my Google account to the ground and scorched the earth over it several years ago, because I was fortunate enough to discover just how completely abusive our relationships with Google actually are.<p>The problem is that most people do not have that fortune. The problem is that Google is a billion dollar monopolist industrial player, with an enormous public relations and marketing budget, and the power to cause itself to be perceived as a big friendly giant. At I/O recently, it literally paid for favourable coverage with free hardware given out to all of the ""tech journalists"" who attended. And the result was 50+ articles on the main tech blogs all frenziedly discovering how wonderful Google was. There was a complete absence of a critical perspective.<p>Most people are not fortunate enough to know how dangerous it is to put your whole life into a foreign corporation's servers sitting on the other side of the planet. They do not realize that the consequence of a whole society doing this is to create the incentives for a less free society. And they do not realize that the moment they become ""interesting"" - such as if they become an activist - all of this technology becomes a weapon against them.<p>Given that they do not realize that - as I once didn't - they sign up for these services. They are given a false impression of how safe they are. They have a choice - yes - but they do not have all of the necessary information to make that choice in an informed manner. Google gives them that choice under false pretenses. And after several years of using it, if they do become aware of it, it is much harder to leave. They feel, ""ah, it's too late now, I have to live with it."" When it is not and never is too late.<p>The ""they have a choice"" argument you make is as about as nuanced as the theory that everyone in a ""free market"" is a ""rational actor."" Yeah, in no-space. Not in the real world. And that's why people get screwed. Assange's argument - and I agree with him - is that we are all getting screwed by Google. The fact that that royal screwing is the consequence of a symbolic choice made under false pretenses is not really a forceful counterargument.<p>>I also think people are too fixated on Google, when VISA/Mastercard, your Bank, your phone carrier, and your ISP have much longer, more comprehensive, and detailed records on your behavior that the police can, and have, been monitoring far longer and with less oversight.<p>For any one of those examples, it is false to say ""more comprehensive and detailed"" I think. These industries gather information on you in order to do their business. Google's business IS gathering information on you. When you take into account content, social graph, IP access logs, search history, browsing history, and all of the other stuff that Google voraciously gobbles up - which is increasing - any one of those industrial players is dwarfed in terms of the data it takes.<p>Taken all together, yes, they give a very detailed picture of you. That's the point. And everyone should be aware of it, and Google is a primary culprit.<p>It's also worth pointing out that Google very likely will attempt to replace each of those industrial players with a service of its own, and in some cases already has.<p>>Google's ""Don't Be Evil"" motto is not about perfection, it is a value, a gradient, that you strive for.<p>It's a marketing slogan. It is also phrased in the imperative. I have wondered more than once - as evil after evil is discovered being perpetrated by Google - whether it is Google's memo to itself, or Google's message to the world.<p>Google's real name policy was evil. Google's aspirations to ""tame"" the internet is evil. Google's evangelizing political correctness is evil. Google's mission directive of gathering all information is evil.<p>I don't care if each crop of comp sci students fresh out of university waltzes wide eyed through Google campus telling itself it'd blow the whistle on any evil it saw. I don't trust those people to know evil if they see it. When you consider how completely banal people like Sergei Brin's conception of evil is:<p>""[Google Glass] are, uh, a new form of computing, uh, thats designed to really free you.""<p>...it is possible to have a lot of sympathy with the title of Assange's essay.",1370177253

I was a front line witness to all this, after all (at one point I realized I could be a witness if this had gone to court).<p>By the time this was playing out, I was intimately familiar with the C base of (UniPress) Gosling EMACS, from having finished a MS-DOS port and was working on an Amiga port.  So it was no trouble to look at GNU EMACS to determine it was, in the the legal, copyright sense, a derivative work, not something that was <i>influenced</i> by it, which is not something that RMS/GNU were even claiming at the time.<p>They said, based on an email they claimed to have received (that as I recall they never produced, but as you note all this hardly matters), that they were authorized to start with an old version of Gosling EMACS, and they claimed they fixed this legally by rewriting every part of it they got from Gosling EMACS ... which doesn't cut it, legally.  If UniPress had been run by junkyard dogs they could have done an <i>USL v. BSDi</i> and put the GNU under a legal cloud, except they probably would have won.  It was an <i>unconscionable</i> risk for RMS to take.<p>Fortunately, all they did was <i>verbally</i> disagree, they thought GNU EMACS would create a bigger market for Gosling EMACS, which I'm sure was true for a while (the version GNU started with was ancient and missing a lot of polish), and that no one would win if they took it to the courts.  It probably helped that they'd previously worked at Plauger's Whitesmiths and the separation was as ugly as you can imagine, although the legal drama was cut short when the other side's lawyer was caught burglarizing their office, which doesn't tend to impress judges....<p>Note the other comments in this discussion about how RMS isn't a good steward of many of the efforts under his control, and I'd add specifically ""look at how GCC died and was replaced by a community version"", the Lucid Emacs/XEmacs mess (in the link that points out RMS can't sing), and Hurd's beyond <i>Duke Nukem Forever</i> path.",1370176405

Unfortunately, this has a whole bunch of problems:<p>- we do not have a universal definition of when a democratic decision is so wrong it is acceptable for someone to stand up against it<p>- that someone has to judge objectively whether his rights were violated in such a way that he is justified to stand up against the democratic will<p>- in many cases, we do not know what the majority really wants<p>- even if a given system/constitution has securities that allow people to stand up against democratically made decisions, these might be seen as either too lax or too restrictive.<p>For example, the German constitution would allow the people to overthrow a democratic government that wants to cut back on social security in such a way as to violate article 20 of the Basic Law[0]  in the US, on the other hand, people apparently sometimes feel obliged to oppose a government that wants to introduce such social security. If even two relatively similar western societies cannot agree on when it is acceptable to overrule a democratic decision, how can we expect to find universal rules for that on a global scale?<p>In essence, it is a philosophical discussion on how much you respect democratic decisions as compared to the rights of individuals, and whether or not you only accept positive law or also include some natural law in your decision-making.<p>I tend to like both democracy and positive law, but YMMV, of course. :)<p>[0] It defines Germany as a social federal state, does not allow to change that definition, and allows everyone to take up arms against those trying to change it, provided that all other means have been exhausted.",1370175152

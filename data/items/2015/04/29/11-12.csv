9457620,comment,9453821,9454947,0,0,the_ed,,,"I figure the thing is with Blendle, as with most paywallsystems, is that they actually turn &#x27;micropayments&#x27; into larger payments. ie: you don&#x27;t want to do a bank-transaction every time you hit a paywallbutton, so they make you pay a larger sum and give you credits. (Like other paywall might provide you with a subscription.)<p>The extra smart thing here being, of course being twofold: First of all, they provide you this service for a myriad of outlets. (Thus limiting the actual transactions (such a hassle!) with your bank even more.\nAnd second: they provide a service for newspapers to publicise their print content online.<p>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, the core thing they made is a way of transferring all these &#x27;print&#x27; articles to online. A benefit for publishers. This is now slowly shifting towards the &#x27;one stop paywall&#x27; core business. One probably couldn&#x27;t start without the other, but in the end we&#x27;ll have a completely new thing. (Which I&#x27;ve described in several rants in Dutch.. yadieyada... stuff.)<p>I tend to pay more for articles these these, although for full disclosure I&#x27;d have to say that I work for a media outlet.

From Wikipedia:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Bomba"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Bomba</a><p>&quot;Thus certain bombs were designed to destroy an entire large city even if dropped five to ten kilometers from its center. This objective meant that yield and effectiveness were positively correlated, at least up to a point. However, the advent of ICBMs accurate to 500 meters or better made such yields unnecessary. Subsequent nuclear weapon design in the 1960s and 1970s focused primarily on increased accuracy, miniaturization, and safety. The standard practice for many years has been to employ multiple smaller warheads (MIRVs) to «carpet» an area, resulting in greater ground damage.&quot;<p>So sprawling won&#x27;t save you neither from the initial &quot;nuclear carpet&quot; (that can be quite wide), nor from the radioactive fallout that have always spread over a much larger area than the radius of initial explosion(s).",1430308365

The first is great if you don&#x27;t have more data on the user than what they picked right now. The other two are better for different applications if you have the data.<p>One pet peeve of mine is that most music players seems to only take into account user similarity, rather than what you&#x27;re likely to like <i>right now</i>. E.g. I rarely want to suddenly transition e.g. from a slow classical track to a super-noisy 8-bit war game chip tune even if I like both. And some transitions are great at some times of day, but not so great e.g. when I want a specific type of music because it works best for me when I&#x27;m working.<p>It greatly annoys me when I use of these services and they make transitions that are &quot;obviously&quot; wrong. If I&#x27;ve skipped the last 5 noisy tracks and listened to every slow track, clearly I want slow music <i>right now</i> even though I&#x27;ve previously loved all those noisy tracks...<p>It must be possible to do so much better...

9457566,comment,9456810,9456810,0,0,musername,,,"><i>Agda’s logic is constructive, which means it’s impossible to prove the statement that all statements are either true or false, . This proposition is called the law of the excluded middle. This makes it impossible to perform, for example, a general proof by contradiction, or other similar “classical” proofs from mathematics. There is a large philosophical debate among mathematicians (those who follow Hilbert, and those who follow Brouwer) as to which is better</i><p>Still, for a subset of statements and properties it is possible to construct a law of excluded middle, but it has to be a constructive proof. The whole idea of Constructive Mathematics is that you have to show a proof for both, the statement and it&#x27;s negation to hold their respective truth values. The impossibility to proof the first statement, that of all statements the negation is implied, is surely tautologic, assuming it would hold true for <i>most of all</i> statements, just not a class the opening one is part of. This class is an empty element.<p>I would basically assume this means nonsense statements can be constructed, but they can&#x27;t be used in constructive proofs. It doesn&#x27;t imply that there has to be a class of nonsense statements where the opposite still holds value.   I&#x27;m cautios of the definition for statements like there or in the multiple incarnations of the liars paradox (whats the latin plural). IE. a statement should by definition be provably correct either in positive or negative logic, hi and low to use ee terms, and one should imply the other polarity (edit: just not by using negation, because that&#x27;s the relation you want to prove, without circular logic). The <i>empty element</i> is like null, but what logic set the true ^ negative or just the true statements have to be defined in I dont know.<p>Interesting to know that there is a tool for this kinda maths, I was under the impression that the debate tends to inductive methods, but here we have intuitionistic (constructive) logic, I take it.",1430308003

You can create a module-local interface describing not just a &quot;generic X&quot; but &quot;specifically what methods of X I want&quot;. That way you don&#x27;t even depend on other object&#x27;s types, but only on their permitted actions. And making mocks is very easy. The IO libraries use this extensively; they don&#x27;t depend on where you&#x27;re getting your IO from. They just require it does this or that.<p>Bonus, you can define &quot;tolerable minimum&quot; and &quot;nice to have&quot; versions of the same local interface. Define your methods in terms of the first, but attempt to cast to the second.<p><pre><code>  if nice, ok := minimal.(Nice); ok {\n    // do stuff only possible with the nice to have interface\n  }\n</code></pre>\nExample: the HTTP libraries will flush your IO if you give them something flushable, but they don&#x27;t require it.",1430306807

Ultimately, I&#x27;d like to get out of freelancing, but for now, at least freelancing lets me demand a higher portion of the margin.

539456,comment,538949,539388,0,0,frig,,,"In the interest of charity and good-naturedness I'll address your points and explain myself further.<p>It was clear from the outset you weren't interested in or thinking about ""existing law"" (because you were claiming to have rights that you don't, under existing law).<p>It was also pretty clear that you had a pretty strong opinion as to exactly what level of control you'd want to have: <i>I would take the controversial opinion that if somebody's going to make a Sparknotes for a novel I wrote, they need my permission.</i><p>I asked you a couple different times why you would want it to be that way -- what's your motivation for wanting the world to be such that, if someone's going to make a Sparknotes for a novel you'd wrote, then they'd need your permission -- and you'd never give a straight answer.<p>You clarified your position slightly -- some kinds of works referencing yours would be ok (like the bible according to harry potter), but others (like sparknotes) wouldn't -- but never actually explained why you adopted that particular position.<p>From what you did write I could probably infer your underlying outlook: it's a little hazy, sure, but basically there's some objective sense in which the contents of works by a particular author are or are <i>creative</i>, and when a work is (1) insufficiently <i>creative</i> and (2) heavily dependent on some other, actually-<i>creative</i> work then control of the work is forfeited to the actual <i>creator</i> of the work's underlying content; under such a system authors would have considerably more control over the actions of others than they would in the present system.<p>If that's not your outlook, no worries: I said I was trying not to put words in your mouth, and that's why I never brought the above up and instead waited for you to explain the connection between your ramblings about relative amounts of creativity and the amount of legal control you wished you had over what other people (<i>hypothetically</i>) did that referenced your (<i>hypothetical</i>) works.<p>I got more and more exasperated when you failed to explicitly draw the connection: why ought such-and-such notion of creativity ought to be granted legal protection above and beyond what it has now and why not this other kind of creative effort?<p>And I got more and more exasperated because, on top of all that, you never even answered the question I asked from my very first post: not ""why do you think such-and-such amount of control is justified"" -- though you never answered that, either -- but ""why would you (personally) want such-and-such control?""<p>I even proffered some hypothetical explanations: maybe you'd ""get something"" (economic) if you had that level of control; maybe you just wanted it on account of aesthetics or moral code; but, why?<p>I'd even have been happy with some self-awareness of the ""yeah, I just would prefer that level of control, and don't have a strong sense why I want that"" sort, but no dice.<p>So: color me disappointed, and hence the exasperation. I will say that, if I've gotten your outlook approximately correct it's pretty alien to me, as any attempt to establish even a quasi-objective notion of <i>creativity</i> involves making a lot of decisions that themselves will depend upon heavily on unstated assumptions.<p>For example, elsewhere you describe a (<i>hypothetical</i>) sparknotes for one of your (<i>hypothetical</i>) writings as entirely dependent upon your work, adding nothing and (possibly) taking much away.<p>That's your opinion; but, like the dude says, ""that's just, like, your opinion, man."" Here's some of the stuff that that outlook minimizes:<p>(1) someone writing a sparknotes for your novel is writing it because your novel has become studied sufficiently often for there to be a healthy market for study aides; that your novel has become studied sufficiently often for their to be a healthy market is NOT solely on account of your novel...it's a complicated byproduct of the specific contents of your market, the dynamics of reviewers and academics, the cultural mores of the time, and so forth.<p>So, already we have a complication: you want to claim that the sparknotes only has value on account of your novel; rather, it has value on account of your novel and the socio-cultural dynamics surrounding your novel, not all of which (to put it mildly) are within your control.<p>I can understand that you might want to have veto ability over the sparknotes on account of some vague notion that ""it's entirely dependent upon my novel for existing"", but to go from that being ""just your opinion, man"" to some kind of enforceable quasi-objective fact means completely discounting the responsibility that the reading and critical audience had upon your works' status; if they hated it, there'd be no sparknotes either.<p>(2) someone writing a sparknotes can easily claim they're more like the ""bible for teens"" (the one that has Jesus saying like ""be awesome to each other"" and ""party on, dudes!"" when he comes down from the mount): they adapt a particular work (your novel) intended for a particular audience (the general reading public) in a particular context (the general social setting of ""literature"", or some genre fiction market if that's your call) for another audience (students) in a different context (educational courses).<p>Your notion of ""creative"" may not square with what they're doing, but for that difference of opinion to become legally enforceable is essentially equivalent to legally drawing a distinction between some platonic realm (<i>that's where art lives</i>) and the practical world, and granting claims into the platonic realm priority over claims of utility.<p>It's akin to when the nose-to-the-grindstone geeks claim ""twitter's just email lists on the web"" -- they're right, but they're right only by ignoring the particularities of the audience and the presentation and the overall <i>framing</i> -- except it'd be codified as law.<p>(3) there's yet another assumptional axis on which <i>creativity</i> might hinge: the notion of what're ideas that're <i>novel</i> and what aren't have huge unstated underpinnings.<p>I'll beat up on JK Rowling a bit. For her work to be <i>creative</i>, all of the following ideas must be deemed freely copyable (in the sense of not calling into question the notion of the extent of <i>creativity</i> of the underlying work):<p>- the notion of crafting a limited-duration children's book series with a coherent plot arc. As long as I've been alive scholastic et al have loved the notion of book series (and for adults there's stuff like fantasy novel series), because by not finishing the entire plot all at once they create an audience eager for sequels. viz, the Prydain books, the Darkness Rising series, literally hundreds more.<p>- the notion of children with special powers going off to a parallel, hidden world for training in those powers, and eventually going on adventures and so forth, with the development and mastery of those powers -- and their eventual use in matters of significance -- making the book some sort of sublimated bildungsroman. Also old hat; the l'Engle books, possibly Narnia (though that lacks <i>powers</i> it otherwise fits the bill), plenty more.<p>- the notion of boarding schools with ""houses"" of distinctive character, etc., which is a mishmash of the boarding school tradition and the oxbrige system<p>...and I could go on. All of those notions are currently ""fair game"", sure, but the point is (1) to start ranking things by <i>creativity</i> you have to draw lines between what's fair game and what isn't and (2) there's too many such decisions to ever explicitly make them all and thus (3) any such ranking-by-creativity will have plenty of those ""decisions"" made implicitly but (4) in your scheme those implicit, never-debated ""decisions"" would have vastly increased legal heft.<p>And stuff like the above is why I don't cotton to an outlook in which <i>creativity</i> not only gets somehow ""ranked"" but in which that ranking takes on a great deal of legal heft (in the form of lawsuits and cease-and-decists and so forth); have all the aesthetic preference you want, plz, but keep them out of my laws if you don't mind sir.<p>This is my absolutely final participation for a few days; gettin' too heated in these here parts.",1238463759

539454,comment,539105,539311,0,0,jerf,,,"Internet people love to declare that X is ""fair use"", but Internet people tend to have much more confidence than they should. (For one thing, they tend to read the criteria for fair use and think it's a logical <i>or</i> operation, when it's more of an <i>and</i>. It isn't either, really, it's what a judge determines, but it's <i>more</i> of an ""and"".)<p>You can't really know until you're in front of a judge, but if we take a tweet as a work, publishing an entire tweet without permission seems awfully likely to fail the amount test. Taking 100% of a work doesn't seem like fair use. You're also in trouble on the ""work's value"" front, because it's likely that the judge will not accept that Mark Cuban's tweets are not of some value. (A judge might write <i>my</i> tweets off as pretty worthless, but probably not Mark Cuban's.) Being given away voluntarily by the owner does not prove they don't have value, merely that the owner perceives that they have more value to the owner in that form, value you are impinging upon by republishing out of his control.<p>Your best bet at this point is to try to claim that the tweet is too small to constitute a ""work"", and you're just excerpting the tweet stream. From this point of view you pass all the fair use tests. However, my uninformed opinion is that this is unlikely to fly, because we recognize important copyrights on small snippets of things all the time, such as advertising slogans, and in every other way, a tweet is clearly an atomic published work, being independent of all the other tweets in the stream.<p>Maybe with a good enough legal team and the right judge, you could win a case that republishing a tweet is fair use, but it would be an uphill battle in my opinion.",1238463635

And, in my humble opinion, it's dangerous when politicians alone decide what should be investigated and studied. It creates a situation where ""intellectual prostitution"" is the norm. Scientists know what the funding agencies want to hear, and write grant proposals accordingly. A monoculture is born. No one works outside the mainstream ideas.<p>Focusing on some areas is good because it creates momentum and leads to faster progress. For instance, in the 1950s and 1960s, the investment in the space program led to an amazingly fast progress. This was good. Entire new fields were developed. On the other hand, when the government alone decides that a certain area is ""evil"" (e.g., stem cell research) then we have a ""New Inquisition"" in place. This is very bad.<p>In an ideal world, scientists would report their findings, politicians would propose courses of action, and people would vote for one proposal over the others.

The problem (as I see it) is that the question ""does man cause Global Warming?"" is ill-posed.<p>OK, let us say that we have a mathematical model of the global climate: a bunch of partial differential equations describing heat and mass flow, etc etc etc. Since humans burn fuels and release C02 on the atmosphere, it is obvious that man influences the weather. The real question is not ""whether"", but ""how much"". The Sun's cycles also influence the weather. Varying levels of cosmic radiation also influence the weather.<p>And if it's possible that the climate is indeed changing dramatically, what does ""global warming"" actually mean? The max temperatures are rising? Or does it mean that the average temperatures are rising?

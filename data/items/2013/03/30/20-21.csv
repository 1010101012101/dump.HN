5466641,comment,5465716,5466486,4,0,nostrademons,,,"FWIW, Google Search still uses <b> tags for byte-saving reasons.  Search terms are all bolded, and the page would become significantly heavier if those were <strong> or <span class=...> tags instead of <b>.<p>(There's some crazyness where they actually become <em> tags in China and are styled differently, because Chinese typographical conventions avoid bolding characters and instead turn them red for emphasis.  I tried to simplify this once and do everything via CSS, but it turns out to be quite complicated because you <i>also</i> have to handle the case of interface text that's not in Chinese and supposed to be bolded, and exceptions for single-character words, and mixed English/Chinese text, and other languages like Arabic that run RTL, and mixed Arabic/English text, and presumably mixed Arabic/Chinese text though I've never seen such a page.

It is not quite the right way to go.<p>zdb now does decompression, though slightly differently from what I implemented.<p>Syntax is:  zdb -R poolname vdev:offset:size:d<p>The ""d"" at the end says to decompress.  zdb tries different decompression algorithms until it finds one that\nis correct.<p>As for my mdb changes, I really think mdb should be able to pick up kernel ctf info so that it can print data structures on disk.  That I could probably get working on illumos fairly easily.\nMy method used zdb to get the data uncompressed, then\nused mdb to print it out ala ::print.  I actually think something like ""offset::zprint [decompression] type"" in mdb is the way to go.  It would mean no need for zdb, which usually gives too much or not enough, and is not interactive (hence, not really a good debugger as far as I'm concerned).  Better would be:<p># mdb -z poolname<p>20000::walk uberblock | ::print -t uberblock_t<p>And from there, something like:<p>offset::zprint lzjb objset_phys_t<p>where offset comes from a DVA displayed in the uberblock_t.<p>Some people seem to get my idea and think it's good.

5466503,comment,5465948,5466112,9,0,greenyoda,,,"Sometimes bugs are genuinely hard to debug and appear in hostile environments. Many people who have been programming for a long time have seen bugs that take much longer than five days to debug. For example:<p>- The bug doesn't reproduce when run under the debugger (not so uncommon with C code). Or the bug goes away when you change the timing of the code by writing to a log file.<p>- The bug could be in code that you didn't write and don't yet completely understand; the people who wrote the code have all left the company.<p>- The bug can be in a third-party library that you don't even have the source code to. You can only infer what the library is doing by seeing how it reacts to what you're passing it. Or you can try disassembling its code.<p>- The bug can be due to bad machine code generated by a compiler.<p>- The bug can be due to undocumented behavior in an operating system.<p>- The bug could be in a really complex algorithm.<p>- The bug might only reproduce at a customer's site with the customer's confidential data.<p>- The bug might be sporadic, perhaps depending on certain patterns of network traffic.<p>- The bug could be due to a fundamental misunderstanding of the original project requirements that will only become apparent after days of investigation.",1364674105

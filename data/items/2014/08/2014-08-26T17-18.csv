8228545,comment,8227429,8228112,0,0,notahacker,,,"I&#x27;d say the amount of interest charged by the average microfinance institution is a pretty good reason to want to reinvent the wheel, especially with impact studies often struggling to find compelling evidence of microlending having a net positive impact on clients. Borrowing from most Kiva institutions costs impoverished people with extremely  unstable incomes far more than the credit cards us salaried middle class Westerners are advised not to binge on, and that&#x27;s mostly because of genuinely high admin costs.<p>Zidisha&#x27;s direct p2p is part of that picture, although at present lending at affordable rates without the overheads of any intermediary still results is default rates that are higher than the interest recovered. Another interesting feature of Zidisha is the willingness of some of its clients in sub-Saharan Africa to participate in discussions on the site and volunteer to help advise borrowers and follow up unpaid debts.<p>Ultimately, digital technology can make credit a <i>lot</i> more affordable in the developing world. For example Zoona (<a href=""http://www.zoona.co.za/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zoona.co.za/</a>), which offers exceptionally low cost credit to tiny businesses in the developing world that are able to take payments via their app, is one of the most potentially disruptive innovations I&#x27;ve seen in payment tech.",1409075908

8228537,comment,8226139,8226139,11,0,Chris_Newton,,,"The situation with packages and dependency hell today is horrendous, particularly if you work in a highly dynamic environment like web development.<p>I want to illustrate this with a detailed example of something I did just the other day, when I set up the structure for a new single page web application. Bear with me, this is leading up to the point at the end of this post.<p>To build the front-end, I wanted to use these four tools:<p>- jQuery (a JavaScript library)<p>- Knockout (another JavaScript library)<p>- SASS (a preprocessor to generate CSS)<p>- Jasmine (a JavaScript library/test framework)<p>Notice that each of these directly affects how I write my code. You can install any of them quite happily on its own, with no dependencies on any other tool or library. They are all actively maintained, but if what you’ve got works and does what you need then generally there is no need to update them to newer versions all the time either. In short, they are excellent tools: they do a useful job so I don’t have to reinvent the wheel, and they are stable and dependable.<p>In contrast, I’m pretty cynical about a lot of the bloated tools and frameworks and dependencies in today’s web development industry, but after watching a video[1] by Steven Sanderson (the creator of Knockout) where he set up all kinds of goodies for a large single page application in just a few minutes, I wondered if I was getting left behind and thought I’d force myself to do things the trendy way.<p>About <i>five hours</i> later, I had installed or reinstalled:<p>- 2 programming languages (Node and Ruby)<p>- 3 package managers (npm with Node, gem with Ruby, and Bower)<p>- 1 scaffolding tool (Yeoman) and various “generator” packages<p>- 2 tools that exist only to run other software (Gulp to run the development tasks, Karma to run the test suite) and numerous additional packages for each of these so they know how to interact with everything else<p>- 3 <i>different</i> copies of the same library (RequireJS) within my single project’s source tree, one installed via npm and two more via Bower, just to use something resembling modular design in JavaScript.<p>And this lot in turn made some undeclared assumptions about other things that would be installed on my system, such as an entire Microsoft Visual C++ compiler set-up. (Did I mention I’m running on Windows?)<p>I discovered a number of complete failures along the way. Perhaps the worst was what caused me to completely uninstall my existing copy of Node and npm — which I’d only installed about three months earlier — because the scaffolding tool <i>whose only purpose is to automate the hassle of installing lots of packages and templates</i> completely failed to install numerous packages and templates using my previous version of Node and npm, and npm itself <i>whose only purpose is to install and update software</i> couldn’t update <i>Node and npm themselves</i> on a Windows system.<p>Then I uninstalled and reinstalled Node/npm again, because it turns out that using 64-bit software on a 64-bit Windows system is silly, and using 32-bit Node/npm is much more widely compatible when its packages start borrowing your Visual C++ compiler to rebuild some dependencies for you. Once you’ve found the correct environment variable to set so it knows which version of VC++ you’ve actually got, that is.<p>I have absolutely no idea how this constitutes progress. It’s clear that many of these modern tools are only effective/efficient/useful at all on Linux platforms. It’s <i>not</i> clear that they would save significant time even then, compared to just downloading the latest release of the tools I actually wanted (there were only four of those, remember, or five if you count one instance of RequireJS).<p>And here’s the big irony of the whole situation. The <i>only</i> useful things these tools actually did, when all was said and done, were:<p>- Install a given package within the local directory tree for my project, with certain version constraints.<p>- Recursively install any dependent packages the same way.<p>That’s it. There is no more.<p>The only things we need to solve the current mess are standardised, cross-platform ways to:<p>- find authoritative package repostories and determine which packages they offer<p>- determine which platforms/operating systems are supported by each package<p>- determine the available version(s) of each package on each platform, which versions are compatible for client code, and what the breaking changes are between any given pair of versions<p>- indicate the package/version dependencies for a given package on each platform it supports<p>- install and update packages, either locally in a particular “virtual world” or (optionally!) globally to provide a default for the whole host system.<p>This requires each platform/operating system to support the concept of the virtual world, each platform/operating system to have a single package management tool for installing/updating/uninstalling, and each package’s project and each package repository to provide information about versions, compatibility and dependencies in a standard format.<p>As far as I can see, exactly none of this is harder than problems we are already solving numerous different ways. The only difference is that in my ideal world, the people who make the operating systems consider lightweight virtualisation to be a standard feature and provide a corresponding universal package manager as a standard part of the OS user interface, and everyone talks to each other and consolidates/standardises instead of always pushing to be first to reinvent another spoke in one of the wheels.<p>We built the Internet, the greatest communication and education tool in the history of the human race. Surely we can solve package management.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2014/06/11/architecting-large-single-page-applications-with-knockout-js/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2014/06/11/architecting-larg...</a>",1409075838

Being entirely serious.<p>My primary comparison is that, since the oil boom, their results have fallen off in nobel prizes, not significantly increased. And those two prizes they won in the last 40 years were for economics (they were winning them for chemistry and physics in the &#x27;60s / &#x27;70s).<p>Ireland has won five since 1974, they only have 4.5 million people, and no grand oil boom, and have only recently become well-off.<p>Denmark has 5.5 million people and have won four nobel prizes in those 40 years, for chemistry, physics, and physiology.<p>My point is: where are the results outside of energy production? We should be seeing amazing innovations, great technology, and big technology exports, incredible global contributions to science and break-throughs in medicine. I should be using phones designed by Norway, and software designed in Norway.<p>So where is it? There is absolutely no question Norway has created a high quality of life courtesy of the money from the oil boom, but what else have they done with it other than provide lots of money to live well (ie what do you have to show for it if the oil is gone in ten years)?",1409075249

For instance, you might bootstrap homology using point-set topology (educational context) and then enhance it using algebraic topology. Eventually, perhaps, the mandatory context is that homology is a measure of non-exactness of chain complexes and this concept can be lifted from its base context and presented wherever exactness is an interesting measure.<p>Point being—language hardly exists in a vacuum. Good language invokes powerful concepts in an efficient manner and allows you to construct arguments using them. Good arguments can link seemingly disparate concepts with ease.",1409075143

If you can without a reasonable doubt say that they are, and have evidence that isn&#x27;t based on negotiations or bonuses, then by all means sue them in court: you are owed money. This is a really hard case to prove though because the burden of proof is on your and thus you must be able to prove via emails from the founders/HR or recorded chats (concrete admissible evidence) of them saying to discriminate against people or its just slander. If you slander or libel them without proof, you will get sued and you will lose. It will also damage your reputation and future career prospects. Just because your salaries are lower doesn&#x27;t mean there is discrimination; the other people could have negotiated better or negotiated at all. There can be other more innocent things as well such as buddies of the founders getting paid more not because they are men but because they are friends. There are a lot of scenarios at play here, and if they are discriminatory I hope you the best to win the case. Nobody deserves to be discriminated against.",1409074428

In my experience that&#x27;s not the case at all. Money and tech are important, but the marketing and strategy are equally, if not more, important. You can build the best tech in the world, but without marketing and sales to get it to customers it&#x27;s worth zero. Don&#x27;t be so quick to discount your friend&#x27;s marketing/strategy input.</i><p>I&#x27;m not at all suggesting, even to myself, the financial & tech aspects are the only things that will make it a success. I&#x27;m certainly not discounting my friend&#x27;s marketing/strategy input.

I was only trying to question if the tech input being valued at 5% was out of line (and included the 30% figure of my friend&#x27;s pre-existing stake because it&#x27;s the only number I know). At least, that&#x27;s why I posted here, but I&#x27;ll be sure to further check my assumptions to ensure I&#x27;m not mentally undervaluing others&#x27; contributions (I don&#x27;t think I am, but it&#x27;s difficult to express that within 2000 chars).<p>What I could not express in 2000 chars was that there appears to be a strong resistance, by MP, my friend, and the others who have already been established as partners to give up as little equity as possible (because they&#x27;ve already divided it up and are happy with their own numbers) while also wanting to drive down the cost of software as much as possible. It&#x27;s difficult to express how that resistance is communicated, but I feel it rather strongly in conversation with both my friend and MP.<p>Anyway, thanks for taking the time to respond.",1409074371

All the real advantages of microservices only start to pay off at scales that you&#x27;ll only reach in a few handful of companies.<p>I am thinking of a small startup, that had a big proponent of microservices as the tech lead, which boldly went all in with this architecture, before any of the real advantages of microservices ever came into play. WHen they went to production the first time, they saw everything was slow, and quickly started to colocate said microservices in the same machines, and made them talk to each other directly, without serialization. In other words, they reimplemented EJB local interfaces. At some point in this process, the microservices champion left.<p>So now they have hundreds of little faux services, and instead of a monolith, they have to worry about what happens when someone wants to change the contract of one of those services. A ball of yarn, by a different name. Instead of wondering whether the code will compile if they make a change, they wonder whether it will run, in practice.<p>It sounds to me like they are not in any better a shape than if they had built a monolith anyway, other than the fact that their employees can now claim they have microservice experience.<p>If we go back to basics, maintainability comes down to getting lucky with your selection of abstractions, and trying to minimize coupling. If your abstractions are wrong, your modularization will be either incorrect or just lacking overall, and no architectural pattern will save you.",1409073682

Standing them on an edge is in the best case precarious and in the worst case impossible (because the edges are sometimes rounded).

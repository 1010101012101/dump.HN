I strongly doubt a government run ISP is going to be great, especially if something happens and it turns into a cost centre, or if it&#x27;s &quot;awarded&quot; to the highest bidder to run, or stuffed full of overpaid incompetents by way of political nepotism.

VisualOps is a DevOps automation service.

We’d like to add Ruby, Node JS and Django into the repo, or ideally multiple stacks dependent on use case.<p>In order to create the best possible app stack we would greatly appreciate your expertise and insight.

MSR did two really good studies on network reliability, when they found that larger Aspen trees are significantly more reliable than smaller ones. If you&#x27;re to build a large tree for every system, you&#x27;re going to have a prohibitively expensive infrastructure.<p>In addition to this, the complexity of having multiple bespoke systems for every time someone calls something special, and dedicated results in higher system, and network administration cost. Because the scales of various networks are going to be different, their implementation will probably vary greatly as well, giving your engineers massive headaches. It&#x27;s been shown that engineers, and software result in the highest number of failures in production systems.<p>Lastly, physical separation is no longer an easy excuse for security. At some point, that separation, intentionally, or unintentionally is going to get broken. It&#x27;s best to begin operating from an idea that shared infrastructure will be more resilient, cheaper, and easier-to-operate.",1406888584

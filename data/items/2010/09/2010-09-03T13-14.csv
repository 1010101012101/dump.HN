As a result, it does not come close enough to a real-world programming task.<p>Once I had looked around, and failed to find a ""run"" button, I decided that I'd try just pressing submit, and I got to the ""we'll email you"" screen.  I'm sure I'm not alone. This would account for the very low pass rates.<p>In the real world, this would be like having all your programmers working with a plain text editor and no compiler, and having them commit untested code, in feature-sized chunks, to trunk for the CI server to build and test.<p>Obviously, under the right circumstances, I could do the work on my own computer, and paste the code into your form, but that sort of defeats the purpose of having it online.<p>Following the doctrine that programs are written for humans first, computers second, a human still needs to read the code to work out whether or not it was well written.  I don't know if you make this available to screeners.<p>You could try applying some other metrics (e.g. max/mean function length), to give more than a pass-fail.",1283522381

1659523,comment,1656587,1658373,0,0,Terretta,,,"Of course video using only 1024x768 tiny pixels on a bright glossy screen will look better than using 1920 x 1080 pixels from a projector.  You simply won't see as many problems with video compression on the small screen with less pixels.<p>Also, just to clarify -- there's not really any such thing as HTML5 video.  There's an HTML5 video <i>tag</i>, and browser vendors can decide what kinds of video the tag should handle in their browser on a given OS.<p>How the video looks on your iPad or projector depends on the compression/decompression algorithm (""codec"") and how efficiently the playback software and hardware can decompress and render frames of video to your screen.<p>Silverlight and Flash both support the H.264 codec, meaning a given frame of video in either technology should look the same.<p>In desktop Safari, the HTML5 video <i>tag</i> ties into any media the installed version of QuickTime can play, including video compressed with H.264.  The HTML5 video tag on iPad and iPhone 3G and later supports H.264 Baseline profile 3.1, while earlier versions of iPhone support H.264 Baseline profile 3.0.<p>Given that Silverlight, Flash, and QuickTime all play back an H.264 encoded video, the exact same file, differences stem from other things besides the video, like excessive CPU usage causing frame drops.<p>For example, Flash 10.0 didn't access hardware acceleration for decompression of H.264, so 720p or higher content would generally drop frames and stutter badly.  Flash 10.1 can, with certain video cards, use the video card to decompress the video, letting the video play more smoothly.<p>Safari 5 and QuickTime also can access hardware acceleration.<p>Meanwhile, Silverlight 3 was much more efficient at decompressing and rendering 720p size video on a Mac than Flash 10.0, while also supporting DRM encryption/decryption, making the Silverlight player a natural choice for Netflix.  (As of Flash 10.1, on compatible Macs, the situation has somewhat reversed.)<p>On the back end, Silverlight streaming servers and Apple adaptive HTTP servers are close enough that an IIS Media Services server can stream to iPhones/iPads.  H.264 video encoded for Silverlight Smooth Streaming or for Apple adaptive HTTP streaming uses generally similar techniques, helping an investment in Silverlight pay off in reaching the Apple iDevice ecosystem.",1283521818

1659516,comment,1658380,1659202,0,0,lelele,,,"Thank you very much for letting me know about ""Irreducible complexity"".  I'll investigate the argument.  My objections to evolutions do not fall into such a realm.<p>Yes, millions of years make difficult for us to think about things.  There are only speculations.<p>> Why specifically can't you believe that it evolves.<p>Because:
1) ""natural selection"" - as I understand it - narrows down variations, it does not expand them.  If one specimen happens to develop a random variation, for such a variation to persist and <i>develop</i> further, that specimen should mate with another specimen sharing such a variation.  We have many breed of dogs which are strikingly different, however if the breeders weren't there, we would have ended with a ""breed soup"" (think about dingoes).
2)  I would expect to see more of a continuum of species, instead of such separate animal kingdoms.  The argument that each species wins because it takes up an ecological niche does not hold, because there are already different species sharing the same niche.
3)  Variations don't need to be exclusive. For instance, being able to breath oxygen from both water and air would be very advantageous.  Still, I don't know of any species which does that.
4) Species should be much more inter-breed-able, whilst specimens are very selective on who to mate with.  Inter-breed among species is known to get you sterile prole (think tigers mating with lions).<p>I do not advocate <i>intelligent design</i>, but I do not reject it either (albeit as I've said already, <i>intelligent design</i> just moves the question about the origin of everything somewhere else).",1283521667

I then mentioned APS cameras, which a lot of people do buy, especially the entry level stuff. In that segment and even in less than perfect light the higher MP cameras have been getting better, not worse.<p>There's an argument to be made that if the manufacturers had stopped at say 12MP (to pick a number) and put all their effort into noise we would have better cameras now for the kind of use people actually put them through. In fact Nikon did just that at the high-end with the D700 and D3. There isn't however much of an argument to be made that the 16MP APS cameras of today are worse than the 12MP cameras of a couple years back. The latest models seem to have both more pixels and lower noise.<p>Maybe you'd like a lower MP camera with even lower noise and maybe you can't buy it because MP sells cameras and thus shapes development. That could be a problem, but saying ""excluding full-frame, more MP is actually worse"" isn't really true. My impression is the complaints about MP are mostly right in compacts and everywhere else tend to be geek snobbery.",1283521167

Applying these three principles to user interfaces, the best user interfaces present lots of features at once, with each button (or small section) of the interface performing a specific, orthogonal task. Indeed, this is how consumer electronics are designed. My microwave allows me to select any mode I want, and manipulate the screen with a keypad in a separate rounded rectangle. The stereo, AC, wipers and headlight controls all manipulate unique parts of my car. My washing machine has a different rectangular selection pad for each ""feature"" of the wash - temperature? color? size? presoak?.<p>Flattening an interface helps the learning curve.

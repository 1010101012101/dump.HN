5317184,comment,5316093,5317113,1,0,nlew,,,"If you're only doing one or two things, the value is a bit more vague. But consider even the simplest interaction: the config file for a service should look like X, and if it has to be changed, the service needs to be restarted afterward. Oh and there are 10 config files, but you only want to restart the service once if any of them changes, after they've all been changed. That's not <i>hard</i>, but it's already starting to look non-trivial.<p>And what if you want to have the same logic for several services? I guess you abstract it out to a function. But then it turns out one of those services doesn't have a restart command, and you have to do stop+start. And another service won't start if you use restart while it's not running, so you have to check if it's stopped and use start, otherwise use restart.<p>It's much more than just whether the code is declarative or imperative, or whether it's idempotent or not. An imperative tool can change your system from known initial state A to desired state B. A declarative system can change it from <i>whatever</i> initial state it's in to desired state B, even if you never considered it might be in that state.",1362383904

From the server perspective, you have no idea if the user has set up a passphrase.  There are security standards which mandate certain kinds of passwords (complexity) and are silent on asymmetric keys, so you couldn't use keys in those environments.<p>The old solution was to do some post-login hack to require a password as well (e.g. to su), or do a VPN (which could have multiple forms of auth) and then ssh with keys after that, but the newest ssh (and I believe commercial ssh for a long time) now supports requiring multiple authentications per login, so you can do ssh key plus passphrase.<p>There are also DLP/etc. reasons why ssh can be problematic in some environments (i.e. where you're required to log/analyze actions taken by users, particularly admin users).  The solution there is to use a bastion host and ssh in and then ssh out, with the user account locked down to log.

That would freak out pretty much any government.<p>Unfortunately, instead of doing that, they stab each other in the back, and are happy when the government does that to a competitor, because they see that as an ""opportunity"" for them to take over (much like Microsoft did in China when Google tried to stand against censorship there and threatened to quit.

At the beginning, the ability to profit from improvements was the motivating factor, and helped to achieve some of the freedom people enjoy today.  Unfortunately, times have changed, so your average worker does work on something that they cannot increase their personal profits by improving.  Wage-earners are indentured servants, with little incentive to improve their output.   Most people think Capitalism is all about the man at the top, but Smith's theory was that the power of the individual to retain the profits of their work was the main cause of the destruction of the feudal system.<p>Smith actually believed late-stage Capitalism would look like all the profits were generated by financiers and bankers, and once that happened it would destruct as unsustainable.<p>So at some point, labor becomes valuable in some manner, or we won't be Capitalists anymore.<p>Possibly we are in a blip, where a couple of decades from now labor-intensive jobs will be spread around the globe more evenly again, when labor in China etc. isn't as easy to arbitrage (which is where the real profits where labor involved come from).",1362382558

Funding data - before today's emergency debt financing) in the hopes of salvaging what they can, with strict terms in place to ensure they are first to be paid upon a sale or bankruptcy.

One I know asked what she should do (she would have to write a check for ""tens of thousands of dollars"" to livingsocial to buy LS common stock, which if the valuation is under a Billion (and cmon it obviously is, look at Groupon look at Amazon's own auditors valuation of less than $100M).  Now she didn't know what a liquidation preference is, or in this case accurately reported by PrivCo to be more than the 1x liquidation preference but ""multple times"" the $110M provided (as even CEO - though said nothing about it in Memo 1, fessed up in Memo 2 yes it is a several times liquidation preference, based on finanial metrics, but won't possibly go as high as 4x.""  Even if it's 3x, that $330M, plus the former $850M preferred raised. What I am going to tell her?  And 4,000 employees who are deciding whether to stay or leave based on what their common stock options are worth sticking around for, and being misled by their CEO (again nothing said in Memo 1 at ALL about impact on common - which cmon folks is worthless - and in memo 2 says ""ok I admit it, your common stock is diluated - but ""not much"" - even though we just got funding with multiple x liquidation preferences, we must pay that back plus interest (""dividends"") within 4 years, then throwing out we might IPO and then it won't matter.  That's Chutzpah to say that with a straight face.<p>I think PrivCo did those employees a service, those 400 laid off about to write a check for LivingSocial common stock- and would have based on the glowing Memo 1 from the CEO - and now are correctly thinking they probably shouldn't as by any math they would be giving their hard earned savings to LivingSocial for a security (its common stock, not preferred) that is worth zero now.

This is a form of rhetorical sleight of hand that's suspicious in an of itself, and MM demonstrates this in the linked essay:<p><i>""But here at UR, we are operating under our own special theory of money, which I have modestly dubbed MoMT (Moldbug Monetary Theory). If you know and believe MoMT, the leap is obvious. In the conventional wisdom, it's not obvious at all.""</i><p>He does this sort of thing constantly.  Besides investing a lot of time in reading even one of his essays, you must spend a lot of mental energy tracking all his off-by-one definitions of slightly uncommon terms.  Again, you have to buy into Moldbugism to even start judging it, which is part of the trap.<p>Edit 1: I've upvoted you because I think yours is a fair response to my attack, while Tav's cry of ""ad hominem"" below is mistaken.<p>Edit 2: Moldbug's comment history here is interesting, in part because it demonstrates that he's very capable of making a concise point.

What follows is devil's advocacy, so be warned.<p>On the whole, it would be better for the world if you wrote something that provided either novel functionality or improved functionality over the existing code.  A poor man's sed in PHP is not really very useful, unless there's some way in which your version is going to be better for users - faster, more reliable, easier to use (though the latter could be achieved by wrapping sed in a nicer interface).<p>Secondly, the people most likely to use such a program are PHP developers who aren't aware of sed.  They would probably be better served by being told how to use sed rather than thinking that they have to use the PHP ghetto version.  Knowing that lots of people are using your poor-man's-sed, and even getting kudos from these people, does not mean that you've created something new and awesome.<p>OK, devil's advocate over.  I don't really believe all of that, although there is _some_ truth in it.  We should try to stand on the shoulders of giants, and creating a monolithic application which replicates the behaviour of sed, grep and find but in a more tightly-coupled and less reusable package is still behaviour worthy of (mild) criticism in a programmer.  If we don't make these criticisms, then in 10 years we'll still be awash with half-assed versions of Smalltalk, or package managers that are no advance on apt or yum, or what-have-you.<p>As a community this is a huge challenge for us.  So much work done by programmers is pointless reinvention of work already done (and improved in countless iterations) by others, and we should lament the fact that reuse is so hard that just rewriting stuff in your favourite language is considered to be the best option.",1359045127

5110336,comment,5109052,5110022,3,0,calinet6,,,"Oh I understand it well, I think. I went through phases such as this in both photography and other fields. I sort of skipped it in programming thanks to a theoretical CS education, and being told constantly ""the language doesn't matter"" throughout my learning phase.<p>I think you're always striving for higher quality at the beginning. You always want to skip over the developing mastery part right into mastery, but it never works that way. So you take shortcuts, and you see that they have effects. To continue with the photography example, if you buy a more expensive lens, for a while it looks like your photographs are getting better. On the surface, they improve. They're smoother, sharper, with better color; whatever. For a while, you think that's what photography is all about, the quality of the image, the lust for higher and higher quality.<p>We do the same thing in programming. You learn a language. It lets you do stuff. But then you learn a <i>different</i> language and it just seems so much better in the areas you believe are important right then. On the surface, it's easier to code in and easier to understand and it results in more polished code, or faster, or it lets you do things in a way that seems cool. You think ""why would anyone ever use Old Language when they could use New Language?"" You build lots of cool things and no one uses them but they're cool anyway.<p>In both fields, the beginner is just learning their tools. It's important to go through that phase in photography, because you learn that lenses and cameras and flashes and gear really do make the result different. The mistake is thinking they make the result <i>better.</i> Because <i>better</i> has many different meanings that are deeper than the surface level that the gear can affect. Same with programming: you make this mistake that New Language is <i>better</i> because it does XYZ <i>better,</i> without realizing that what you're actually building has a deeper meaning than just what the language does better. That it actually takes a lot of different languages, or that Old Language might actually be a better choice because you don't need XYZ, you need ABC. Or something.<p>It's the difference between mastery and the illusion of mastery or the desire for mastery, and it's the process of learning what tools are for and why they're important, before realizing that they're only important on the surface: as a means to an end. It's an attempt for quality before mastery, which has a limit.<p>Once you have mastery though, if you've got all the other parts right, then chances are you're going to choose the right language. Language isn't unimportant because it's not important (it is); it's unimportant because if you have everything else right, then the choice of language follows naturally. It's not a concern. It's an afterthought that a true master will already have the answer for.<p>This is why if you go up to a professional photographer and ask them what kind of camera and lens they're using, they'll just give you a quizzical look and roll their eyes. In their head, the answer is obvious. ""The right one.""<p>Will they still be attached to their gear? Of course. Will they still prefer what they're used to? Of course. But they have no illusion that it means anything more than that.<p>In the end, the photographer in the right place at the right time with the right light still wins, regardless of the geareven though he still has the right gear. And in the end, the programmer with the right project and the right customers with the right need still wins, regardless of the languageeven though that programmer has probably already chosen the right language.",1359044879

But of course even more embarrassing to California in the years that I have been an adult have been the poor results in California schools, even compared to funding levels there that were higher than in some other states.

Also, for a passive trading algorithm its important to have level II data (the order book), or the algorithm is flying blind.<p>Re 1, its not the size of the data set which prevents overfitting (larger data sets actually make it more likely), but the use of it when developing/training the algorithm. Repeated testing and tweaking the algorithm will overfit, unless one is careful to maintain the complexity of the algorithm.<p>Anyway, best of luck to your users! But they should be warned that active trading on signals (price prediction) is the hard way to algorithmic profit.

But it's relevant since a) we need to be mindful of the ""other"" who's persecuted, as we're reminded by some of our own who are persecuted.\nand b) this talk highlights how we accept the <i>moment</i> as <i>normal</i> even when the moment is unjust. The talk reminds us to stand up and fight for what's right, rather than accept the new normal.<p>Finally, I'm reminded of the Martin Niemller quote that we should always remember:<p>""First they came for the communists,\nand I didn't speak out because I wasn't a communist.<p>Then they came for the socialists,\nand I didn't speak out because I wasn't a socialist.<p>Then they came for the trade unionists,\nand I didn't speak out because I wasn't a trade unionist.<p>Then they came for the jews,\nand I didn't speak out because I wasn't a Jew.<p>Then they came for the catholics,\nand I didn't speak out because I wasn't a catholic.<p>Then they came for me,\nand there was no one left to speak for me.""<p>EDIT: I do apologize for the hyperbole folks... it was more inspired by the TED talk I linked to than the article above and the feelings caused by the Schwartz case and others.

By using antibiotics you kill most of the bacteria, and then the immune system finishes them off.<p>After all, if any bacteria were left wouldn't they just get the person sick again?<p>An infection starts with just a few bacteria, a reinfection would be the same - unless the immune system keeps them in check, in which case there are no bacteria left to build resistance.<p>If a bacteria is resistant then giving the full does wouldn't help anyway, it's resistant after all. It won't do anything except remove all competition so the resistant will be the only bacteria left. It seems to me it's better to try to kill only some of the bacteria so you don't isolate the resistant one so well, and rely on the immune system to kill most of the bacteria.",1359044284

The point of a conference used to be about exchanging ideas with people outside the neighborhood.  It would roll in airline, hotel, $100s for attendence fees (because the venues are large and require organizers.)<p>Basically, these things turned into junkets in exotic locations.  And then many companies decided they are no longer necessary in the age of the web.",1359043632

You'd do better to argue for that and leave ""assault weapons"" out of it lest you be put in the position of defending restrictions on barrel shrouds and bayonet lugs.<p>By the way, ""magazine"" and ""clip"" aren't the same thing. A clip is a device used to load an empty magazine with ammunition quickly. Some people will assume you are ignorant about guns in general if you use them interchangeably.<p>* I think that limiting magazine capacity would have a large impact on mass killings, but perhaps not crime.*<p>I think you're right about crime and wrong about mass killings. The VT shooter set a new record for the number of people killed, and he fired an average of ten shots per magazine, though some of his held 15. A person shooting unarmed victims can generally time his reloads so that it would be difficult for victims to rush him. A person using a gun in self defense likely has less opportunity to do so given that they're generally dealing with determined, armed opponents.",1359043623

Do devices get frequent (and comprehensive) enough firmware updates for this to actually matter? I would assume this varies with the type of device.<p><i>Manufacturer is using binaries that they don't have source for</i><p>This could be recursive, or it could be that the binaries were obtained by questionable means. Are there other reasons (if so, those would probably apply to the final device manufacturer as well and so still be recursive)? I didn't see anything about (perceived) patent liability in the article, maybe companies fear that releasing source would invite suits from patent trolls? Are there more reasons?<p><i>Non-repeatable build process</i><p>If a proper process is actually cheaper, shouldn't companies that don't have one die out? Is this happening or not? Why?",1325703597

It requires computing resources, connectivity, and electricity, all of which we pay for.<p>I don't think the issue of digital copying is as revolutionary as we all like to think it is. I think we can look at it as another step on the long trek of using automation to reduce content production costs--a trek which began with the advent of the printing press. That was when the legal concept of copyright originated--which, for historical context, was the time of Newton.<p>If you had a printing press back then, the cost of reproduction was reduced essentially to the commodity costs of paper and ink, plus the time to configure the copying.<p>Fast forward to today. If you have a computer, the cost of reproduction has now been reduced to the commodity costs of electricity, fractional hard drive cost, and bandwidth, plus the time to configure the copy. Granted, those costs are way, way lower than a printing press 300 years ago. But to me at least that seems like a matter of degree than some fundamental difference.",1325703564

Your `context` is called `unwind-protect` in common-lisp.<p>There's a difference in that `unwind-protect` does not take an ""opening form"" (which you call `prolog`), and this makes your `context` implementation broken: you're executing the epilog if the prolog blows up, which is not correct as you have an `o` of `undefined` at this point (and your epilog likely awaits some sort of valid resource).<p>Side-note, your javascript code also looks incorrect, `apply` takes a context (a `this`) as its first parameter, so you're not applying arguments you're taking the `args` array as the `this` of your prolog.

Its a major hassle, and if you leave it to the company it will (usually) never happen.<p>So advice for people in the same boat in the future, If it is something you really want to do, then you need to know <i>exactly</i> how the process works at every step of the way and also have a really good Lawyer that the company can talk to if they have questions. They can help you if tricky things come up (and they will if the company applying for you is small enough).<p>I advise you not to go with a lawyer from a big firm, those guys just want to see dollars ... and if your case is small and tricky they will not be interested. trust me.  Try to find an individual or small firm that is responsive and knows the ins and outs of the process far better than you ... if possible ask them to tell you the trickiest situation they've helped a client with before ... that should give you some idea of how good they are. Usually they can bill you for their time spent talking the company, or their lawyer down from the ledge (this will happen), or if they handle the process then you or the company can pay their fees.<p>Lay out the process when the company asks about it (because they will usually not know), let them know that its not complex, just a pain in the ass and that you will handle most of the legwork (you're prepared to do this right?) ... some people chip in to help with the fees if they're so inclined ... this is frowned upon and I think the law has been changed to make it illegal, use that information as you want.<p>Above all, be persistent, upbeat and constantly in touch, do not think that a company is going to jump through hoops to pay $5000 to get you. And remember that some of the requests that are made of the company (like tax returns etc) might cause them to stall, so be prepared for that.<p>It will come down to how bad you want it.

This means no Green Card applications, including the Green Card Lottery.<p>One other thing that may not be unique to the E3, but is worth understanding is that your tenuous presence in the US is bound to the employment quite tightly.

You want to be optimistic and skeptical about two different things. You have to be optimistic about the possibility of solving the problem, but skeptical about the value of whatever solution you've got so far.<p>People who do good work often think that whatever they're working on is no good. Others see what they've done and are full of wonder, but the creator is full of worry. This pattern is no coincidence: it is the worry that made the work good.<p>If you can keep hope and worry balanced, they will drive a project forward the same way your two legs drive a bicycle forward. In the first phase of the two-cycle innovation engine, you work furiously on some problem, inspired by your confidence that you'll be able to solve it. In the second phase, you look at what you've done in the cold light of morning, and see all its flaws very clearly. But as long as your critical spirit doesn't outweigh your hope, you'll be able to look at your admittedly incomplete system, and think, how hard can it be to get the rest of the way?, thereby continuing the cycle.""<p>-Paul Graham",1325701624

Can you as the manager lead from afar -- its harder than you might think. You can trust workers to actually work, you can just let them go for not doing so. But it's harder to trust your remote workers to engage with the company and their peers digitally. It's not easy. Also, the technology may be a pain to use, and kill any good intentions or habits you may have started.<p>The similar problem with remote is that the manager and their team must consciously prevent the ""silence"" the author alluded too. Likely, the silence was not intentional. People get distracted in ""realspace"" and easily can neglect remote worker. In order to have a remote team be viable, you have to overcome this barrier.

Although it's pretty tough being treated like you did, I think you and possibly the offering company went into the arrangement without enough information. I remember that the H1B pool is relatively small (in the 10's of thousands) per year. And that well connected immigration lawyers and sponsoring companies usually exhaust that pool within the first day they are released. After that, it's virtually impossible to get a H1B. And when you if you're lucky enough to be able to wrangle a H1B, it's a pretty convoluted and costly (for the sponsoring company) application process.
Good luck with the next round of H1Bs, the sponsoring company   (and lawyers) need to get in quickly! You sound like a well qualified dev, and it's a shame that the US misses out on good talent because of an inadequate immigration system...",1325700114

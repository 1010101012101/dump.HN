281852,comment,281741,281741,0,0,aasarava,,,"To beat Craigslist, you need to find something about Craiglist that can not only be done better -- but that users actually want <i>more</i> than Craigslist's reach.  Both those requirements need to be there for a competitor to have a chance.<p>In other words, it's not sufficient enough to say, ""Somebody could easily build a better-looking Craiglist"".  Users aren't willing to post or browse classifieds on a site that may look nicer by doesn't have the same reach.<p>Likewise, it's not sufficient to offer a site that has ""modern"" (Web 2.0) tools.  Again, that doesn't help users with their primary objective: getting their ad in front of as many people as possible.<p>So does Craiglist even have an Achilles' Heel then?  In my opinion, the one thing that absolutely sucks about posting an ad to Craiglist is getting a ton of flakey or illegible responses from people who are just wasting your time.  I don't bother to post small items there anymore because it's just not worth the trouble.  If someone could develop a site that filters out all the flakes, I bet you'd have a compelling reason for people to start using it.",1219257919

(i.e. there were apple people at apple in the 90's.. just no Jobs)<p>They lost the battle. Time for an aggressive plan B to stay in business.<p>If I were in charge of plan B I would do the following:<p>- The Centro is a great concept - come in at a far lower price point and grab an untapped market.  Now tie it to online services (myspace, hulu, facebook) and get them to brand and sell to their end users.<p>- It's all about the software.  Realize this.  Focus on making a few killer applications that people like versus the ultimate operating system that your never going to ship.  ($12million for BEOS???)<p>My 3 killer applications would be:<p>- App1: Keeping family's connected and in touch with each other could be a large market.  Build the 'family' phone that has the dots of where everyone is and a 'feed' that let's everyone know what they are doing.  Don't make it lot's of disconnected apps.  Let me press a 'dot' and send a text message, or call the dot.<p>- App2: Gaming.  But on a large scale.  Come up with intricate gaming concepts that become more fun with millions of users, all connected, with a small screen and a GPS.<p>- App3: Live social network.  There are apps for detecting friends nearby and such, but none built into the phone.  Make it simple and behind the scenes.  Have phones that then target specific demographics, like the teen male/female markets.  Build a twitter into the background of this.  This would be like the family concept, but feed off your favorite social network(s).  Why can't I text you from your myspace page?

When everyone else was charging for listings, Craigslist came in and took that whole market. Now everyone else has to give it away for free as well as convince people to switch (and pay marketing money to let people know they even exist as an alternative). If you were starting a business, would you want to use up capital just to be able to give something away for free? Right now the hurdle is just to big too jump over.",1219256241

281801,comment,280425,280520,0,0,ricree,,,">My plan B for them would be to change store format entirely. Build a nice home theatre that can sit 20 people and have showings of new releases. The catch is they use equipment that is in the $1000-$5000 price range, and it's a great experience that you can 'take home'. Delivery is free. Installation is extra.<p>Toss out Blockbuster entirely, and I think that this could be a viable business in and of itself so long as you could negotiate decent licensing terms.  The only change I would make is to focus on allowing customers to choose the movie.  Right now, people are pretty much limited to seeing movies in theaters when they first release and watching them on home systems.<p>The declining price of home theater systems makes the second option a bit better, but there is still a huge gap between the two experiences.  I think that a company could do very well for itself by offering a quality moviegoing experience for small groups(let's say mini theaters seating anywhere from 10 to 50).  The ability to watch old favorites on the big screen (and let's face it, who wouldn't want to watch Jurassic park in theaters again), and the opportunity to watch directors' cuts that never entered theaters in the first place could be a huge draw.",1219256110

Just because you're getting the same amount of time per week from them doesn't mean you're the getting the same efficiency too. 37S has already expanded on this topic and I fully agree.<p>I get frustrated with these kinds of articles where the author demonstrates their lack of willingness to think outside the box or attempt to grasp some counter-intuitive ideas on this topic.<p>A workweek of four, eight-hour workdays with the option to work into your 3-day weekend on occasion is the way to go for a lot of traditional 9-5 office jobs, IMO. Your ""Four Tens"" and ""Power Shifts"" are going to burn out a lot of people unnecessarily. What I fear is that some companies will start experimenting with a 4-day workweek by compressing more human time into fewer days and will be unhappy with the results they get, thus returning to the standard 5-day workweek with the claim that their experiment failed and 4-day workweeks ""don't actually work"".

3728505,comment,3725302,3725302,2,0,javajosh,,,"It is wise to ask foundational, self-reflective questions in an interview. At the very least it gives insight into the interviewer's level of self-awareness, or at least whether or not they are comfortable introspecting. And, based on the book ""Pragmatic Thinking & Learning"" by Andy Hunt it seems that introspection is an essential skill to anyone who has ""learned how to learn"".<p>Knowing who you are and what drives you is a very difficult question for most people. Most of us don't take the time to seriously ask the question of what drives us. And yet, once we find those drivers, why not be honest about that insight? What do we have to lose? Isn't this the kind of information we should be shouting from the rooftops, to find like-minded people and to express ourselves most fully?<p>That said, I would choose to ignore the rather obvious attempt to make me reveal details about past employers and answer the question as if it was about purely about my principles and motivations.<p>For the record, I want to use technology to combat the ever-growing tyranny of complexity, which is the source of an extraordinary volume of what I term petty injustice. I don't believe in the efficacy of central authority, so my work must empower individuals to take action for themselves - to select simpler contracts for example. It is my belief that fighting for a principle I believe in is the most crucial aspect of selecting a team. That said, competent work-mates and managers, a viable technology platform and good compensation are also important, if only from a simple, practical standpoint.",1332237560

They wanted to work more, to get more money.""  This, the biggest gripe, at a place that had to deploy suicide nets around the building perimeters. I can't think of a more patronizing way to write this article.<p>I, personally, don't know what goes on at Foxconn. But the chance at holding accountable those who enable injustice was lost the day the US bank representative stood proudly in front of Congress and announced ""We're too big to fail.""; knowing that any backlash would be brief and easily defeated. At that moment it became clear to me that propaganda, which many thought the internet would disable, is more powerful than ever.<p>Disinformation has far greater utility than information.",1332237544

3728494,comment,3724421,3725790,2,0,gillianseed,,,">It is an unfortunate byproduct of GPL like licenses that they poison[1] the market for those specialized tools.<p>Obviously GPL 'poisons' the market for derivative _proprietary_ tools. The whole idea behind GPL is that the end user should have the right to get the source code. If the only way to charge for your work is through artifical scarcity by hiding the source code then no, you can't do that as a derivative of someone else's GPL licenced code.<p>If we are talking about your own code, then obviously you can licence it both as GPL and offer it through other agreements aswell. Take x264 for instance, the devs are making good money by offering it through a proprietary licence for those who doesn't want to open their source while making it freely available for open source projects under GPL.<p>And your copy protection analogy is hypocritical. GPL actually prevents the artificial scarcity employed by copy protection, contrary to the market example you described where someone won't create a GCC plugin because they can't keep it proprietary and thus employ artificial scarcity.<p>There's no point in arguing against GPL not working with proprietary code given that GPL was created to prevent working with proprietary code. That doesn't mean that you aren't allowed to make money with GPL licenced code, only that you can't do that through A) limiting the number of copies the recipient can make of the software, B) denying the recipient the source code should he/she request it.<p>Obviously this prevents the most traditional way of making money from software which is through artificial scarcity (except the case of when it's truly _your_ code, then you can offer other agreements apart from GPL as in the case with x264), however other ways of making money off open source has emerged like that of Red Hat.<p>edit: I do agree though that disallowing plugins is ultimately not the way to go since there's alot of possibilities that they offer (and no, I'm not talking about proprietary plugins of which I couldn't care less) and I'm glad that GCC now has a plugin-architecture.",1332237397

When I was 12 (in 1994) I became interested in Linux because it had so many development tools available. I thought computers and programs were magical, and Linux/bash/Perl/gcc et al. made it possible for me to learn programming. And Slackware Linux could be obtained for 10 guilders or less.<p>My generation became hackers through GNU and Linux, just as the generation before used MSX, C64, or a ZX machine with a free BASIC interpreter.<p>IMO, the sickening development is not so much that Mac and iOS developer accounts cost $99 per year. It's that the world (Apple and Microsoft) is slowly moving to a model where there is a gatekeeper who decides what gets in and what does not. As a bonus the gatekeeper gets 30% of every purchase. I can sympathize with the need to provide a 'trusted' source of software, but it should also be possible to install whatever the heck you like.<p>What would the Internet be if it followed this model?",1332237373

It will become the standard as more and more brokers see the value of being a consultant and high level strategist rather than thinking time is better spent completing busy work that consumes too much time. This time can be spent on innovating our industry, adding value to our clients that will gain loyalty forever, maybe even challenging the sheer idea of real estate, and implementing a community aspect to real estate city-wide, nation-wide or even globally. we need workplace innovation and so many things are possible when we are not bogged down by the old system and ways of doing things. 
I envision significant changes in the ways of doing business in this industry because of 42Floors. They have their work cut out for them, toppling a monopoly, but their beautifully designed site with accurate and expansive data and innovate plans in the works to help brokers and consumers run a deal from start to finish is the right approach.

The fact that people feel no need to upgrade their PCs anymore yet they are still rushing out to buy the new iPad is symptomatic of that. Surely I'll buy a new PC in the future to replace my old one, but I don't expect my sister or dad to do the same.<p>I once had a workmate in 1999 whose sentiment was similar to your post, just focusing on a different device. We got into an argument about whether the desktop PC market was over or not.

That you could never do more than surf the web on it, you couldn't hack serious code with it.<p>That tablets are for consumption only...really? Diagramming (e.g., OmniGraffle), vector graphic production, sketching, mixing and producing music, editing images, updating a spreadsheet...why not? Many are using tablets for production already.

But an employment isn't the same as a relationship with a Person.<p>Life in most large corporates starts with heightened expectation in the first few weeks/days and from there on its a constant decline and a complete mismatch in what the person expected and what the actual reality is.<p>My experiences have been horrible, I've seen a never ending timeline of nepotism, biased behaviors and partiality in large companies. Endless bureaucracy, politics and socialist style of 'one works, everyone else leeches on him' style of working very common.<p>Its this bitter fact is what causes the maximum attrition of good people from the company and not the inevitable boredom that happens with historical baggage.",1332234751

You might not have intended it that way, but it does have that subtext. Just to make it totally explicit, suppose I answer ""money"" in my top 5 then you might say ""oh, he cares too much about money, he's some greedy person, not the upstanding sort we want here"", but if I don't answer ""money"" in my top 5 you might say, ""well money isn't important to you so I won't pay you what you're worth.""<p>It's like the more-famous question, ""Have you stopped beating your wife yet?"" -- which presumes a statement as fact without asserting it, and therefore is offensive and difficult to reply to.<p>The difference is, the factual state presumed -- even if you didn't intend it (though the author certainly did) -- is, ""I am an armchair psychoanalyst. Let me psychoanalyze you."" You've taken your role as ""someone who will decide whether you could make this company money"" and raised it to the power of ""someone who might decide whether you're a worthwhile human being.""<p>If you're not prepared to see that this might offend some people, and to apologize and admit that you hadn't thought of it that way, then you're probably not really suited to working with grownups. ^_^",1332234554

You can ALWAYS and should ALWAYS talk to SOMEONE. My advice is find a great therapist. If you can't afford one, you need to find a friend, confidant, or family member that's away from the action. Talk through things and see if you can wrap your head around what's bothering you.<p>2. Exercise. Seriously. Exercise helps sleeps, weight loss, anxiety, depression, add--it's a pretty awesome medication. Read ""Spark"" by John Ratey.<p>3. Sleep. The times in my life I've felt most burnt out corresponded with awful sleeping patterns. (also see 2)<p>4. Reflect. After trying to talk through things and getting your body back on track think about your work. Are you happy doing what you're doing? Do you want to do something else? (some might recommend doing this first--I wouldn't; only because in my judgment I've made decisions I regretted because I felt like I wasn't in the right place--not because I really didn't like the opportunity)<p>This is obviously a reader's digest version, but it took me probably 5 or 6 iterations before I could identify, prevent (or treat) my burnout.",1332234188

If your car makes funny noises - you go to a garage, were there are professionals. 
If you have an infection - you consult an M.D.<p>But we tend to ignore psychological conditions and we tend to ask others (amateurs) for an opinion. But this is really nothing more than a physical illness in respect to the way it has to be treated - by an expert.<p>So do yourself a favor and ask your favorite search-engine for professionals, that know their stuff, when it comes to burnout. And then make an appointment. You are no good to your startup, if it crashes around you, because you crash and burn. You are no help to anybody, if your condition affects your work (and it will do that soon).<p>You have the responsibility for everybody, who's paycheck depends on the success of your startup - and that depends on your well being.<p>And: You owe it to yourself to heal.<p><i>just my two cents</i>",1332234169

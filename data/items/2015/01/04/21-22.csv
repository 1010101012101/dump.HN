I&#x27;ve heard of terraform, although I&#x27;ve not investigated it much further than that.<p>It sounds like it&#x27;s mostly a provisioning tool, and doesn&#x27;t really help with configuration management once your machines exist. From the &quot;terraform vs chef / puppet&quot; page:<p>> Terraform enables any configuration management tool to be used to setup a resource once it has been created. Terraform focuses on the higher-level abstraction of the datacenter and associated services [...]<p>So it sounds like like a very nice provisioning tool, but doesn&#x27;t really compete with NixOS itself.

That doesn&#x27;t mean we shouldn&#x27;t be teaching students business (value of the MBA another conversation.)<p>b) I&#x27;m not a VC but the returns for startups is something along the lines of lose 100% of the money, may be return the investor&#x27;s capital, or post a great return. All the mechanics underlying what it takes to make it to &#x27;great return&#x27; by itself limit the number of big winners. This isn&#x27;t investing in apartment buildings, creating a new food franchise, or arbitraging bonds. Most likely the &quot;me too&quot; trend riders will end up in the lose 100% of the money box.

How long were these contracts exactly?<p>If they contracted with a firm to provide bed linens, and haven&#x27;t seen the performance of these linens in service, would they sign 20 year iron-clad deals? If their customers complain that the per-night cost of the linens are equal to buying them, or hate them to the point of bringing their own sheets, would they still stick to their guns?<p>Would they appeal to the Federal Sheet Commission for help blocking third party sheets?<p>Or would they say &quot;this isn&#x27;t worth it&quot;? They&#x27;re in the business of accommodating guests, not antagonizing them. So then find a way out of this contract or just eat the termination fee. After all, if the deals are so bad, the minimum + a reasonable modern deal may break even or come out ahead. Every contract has a way out, particularly when performance goals are not met, and I&#x27;m just skeptical that an entire industry of multi-billion dollar companies got so thoroughly taken for a ride by upstart wifi installers in 2003.",1420408636

There are only three non-overlapping channels for 2.4Ghz 802.11b/g/n, and mifi devices that I&#x27;m familiar with pick a &quot;good&quot; channel on startup -- they don&#x27;t limit themselves just to the three non-overlapping ones.<p>5GHz is better, and the decreased ability to pass through walls is likely desirable here. However, your mifi is still broadcasting in 2.4GHz, and wifi clients will fall back to that if they don&#x27;t like the quality of the 5GHz signal. OS X, for instance, is very finicky about using 5GHz on an SSID that broadcasts for both 2.4/5. Right now I&#x27;m approximately 6 feet away from my AP, and my laptop has switched to 2.4GHz.<p>Ultimately though, this whole mess is the fault of the hotel&#x27;s poor implementation. If their wifi was free or low cost, and worked well, then why wouldn&#x27;t everyone use it?

It is not possible to construct a pointer into another stack frame like my code does without invoking undefined behavior. To wit:<p>&quot;When an expression that has integer type is added to or subtracted from a pointer, the result has the type of the pointer operand. If the pointer operand points to an element of an array object, and the array is large enough, the result points to an element offset from the original element such that the difference of the subscripts of the resulting and original array elements equals the integer expression. In other words, if the expression P points to the i-th element of an array object, the expressions (P)+N (equivalently, N+(P)) and (P)-N (where N has the value n) point to, respectively, the i+n-th and i−n-th elements of the array object, provided they exist. Moreover, if the expression P points to the last element of an array object, the expression (P)+1 points one past the last element of the array object, and if the expression Q points one past the last element of an array object, the expression (Q)-1 points to the last element of the array object. If both the pointer operand and the result point to elements of the same array object, or one past the last element of the array object, the evaluation shall not produce an overflow; otherwise, the behavior is undefined.&quot;<p>This is a long-winded standards-language way of saying that if you compute x+y, where x is an array and y is not a valid index in the array or one past the end of the array, the behavior is undefined.

Its source gives it authority, and the American public tends to accept and support the State Department view.<p>> The report of Dr. Pritchett, a trustee of the Carnegie Foundation for International Peace, is an attempt to find the facts about this Jewish colony in the midst of a restless Arab world. When Dr. Pritchett&#x27;s survey convinced him that in the long run Zionism would &quot;bring more bitterness and more unhappiness both for the Jew and for the Arab,&quot; this point of view was broadcast with all the authority of the Carnegie Foundation, so that the public would hear and believe. The statement by the president of the Real Estate Board of New York, and Secretary Hoover&#x27;s report, are similar attempts to influence the public toward an opinion.<p>> These examples are not given to create the impression that there is anything sinister about propaganda.

The hucksters who created this fraud bailed out for the most part once they hyped the price up to over $1000 in November 2013.<p>People are still suckered into the Nigerian scam, and are also still suckered into <i>this</i> scam, for reasons unknown to me.  The creator, &quot;Satoshi Nakamoto&quot; turns out not to be a real person.  Mt. Gox is busted for fraud.  The main ASIC makers, Butterfly Labs, are busted for fraud.  The coins have no value.  What signals do people need to realize to not spend their hard-earned cash on these worthless hashes?<p>Of course, some high faluting types in Silicon Valley have put their imprimatur on Bitcoins.  But they did the same thing to Pets.com, Flooz and other worthless dot-bombs 15 years ago.  Just like major banks and Wall Street peddled worthless subprime real estate and mortgages 8 years ago.

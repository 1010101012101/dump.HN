3181450,story,,,52,44,roblobue,"Ask HN: I cannot afford to scale",," but I cannot afford not to.<p>Almost a year ago I decided to quit my job and start 2011 doing something I've always wanted to do: start my own company. I started with two primary aims: 1) to provide the best, most accessible app translation service and 2) learn as much as I can about running a business as possible. I decided from the very start it was ok if there were a few mistakes along the way, just learn from them for the future.<p>Now I'm at a point where my knowledge escapes me and I'm looking for some advice as I'm beginning to turn away customers.<p>My revenue is client based. A small iOS or Mac OS app can take me around 4-5 hours of my time in a week. A medium sized app 8-10 hours. A big app or a technical app takes me much much longer. And that's only if things go well. You all know client work involves last minute changes and lengthy email discussions.<p>As you can see with those times, there's only so much I can do.<p>I don't charge enough. Revenue minus costs is healthy, until you factor in my own time. When we're talking pennies per word ($0.14 USD per word) you can see how a small project (250 words) costs me money and a big project (4000 words) costs me a lot of time (which means I have to refuse other projects). I can't increase costs because of competition, even though I am sure my service provides a much higher quality translation.<p>I can't afford to take a second person on. We will be able to take on more work, sure, but I can't guarantee someone a full-time position. Maybe I could use a vWorker, but I want a relationship with my colleagues. I need to know we're on the same page.<p>So as you can see, I need a bit of advice. I love my clients and the rapport I have with them. But I need to expand and move this away from a life-style business into something a bit more automated (while maintaining quality).",1320144560

So what? Just don't use Facebook.<p>You're forgetting another first world problem that many people have: peer pressure. ""What, you're not on Facebook? Lol, looser."" Besides, with bullshit like the Facebook Login coming up, it's not unreasonable to assume that you WILL be forced to use Facebook for many things on the web. While I personally don't care and can put up with the peer pressure, other people can't.<p>And people ARE being forced to use proprietary software. At home, at work, everywhere, and if it's only because they don't know any better, or have been locked in by proprietary formats. You don't always have a choice.<p>Furthermore, it's not just about having a choice. It's about breaking the dominance, and eventually getting rid of proprietary software altogether.

3181440,comment,3179370,3180448,1,0,lloeki,,,"> Ruby's metaprogramming facilities are dead simple compared to Python's<p>I actually have the opposite experience, Ruby's eigenclasses and the <i>self</i> way to handle them to create class methods feels convoluted and shoehorning whereas __metaclass__ and the way you inherit of Class feels straightforward to me. The same goes for modules extending/including behaviors versus sane multiple inheritance combined with metaclasses and the way you manipulate methods and functions just assigning them as attributes, without any need for three handfuls of helper methods. Ruby's approach of development is so pervasive that I (and not only me) always have to check if I won't be tripping on someone else's wires. When I tell that, the Ruby crowd shouts at me that Ruby monkey-patching is safe! So let's make it safer[1]! It honestly feels like needless complexity, over-engineering, or jumping through more hoops.<p>I know both approaches quite well but I can't help but think that the Python approach just fits in, like a self-solving Tetris, whereas Ruby feels like I constantly need to solve puzzles. Granted it's fun when you learn the language, drawing a picture of where classes, instances and eigenclasses of each fit, but when you want to be productive you just want it to flow, not solve another damn puzzle of how I can do this smartly so that things don't end up making galaxies collide.<p>PS: don't get me wrong, I actually love both languages, but while it's love-love with Python, it's actually love-hate with Ruby.<p>[1] <a href=""http://yehudakatz.com/2010/11/30/ruby-2-0-refinements-in-practice/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yehudakatz.com/2010/11/30/ruby-2-0-refinements-in-pra...</a>",1320144290

3181419,comment,3181188,3181188,1,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Gosh this column is muddled. It's no wonder there's a problem. If you can't think clearly about an issue it's highly unlikely you're going to be able to shed light on it.<p>Startups are businesses that make something people want that are highly scalable.<p>So no, ""startups"" and ""small businesses"" are different things. Your dentist has a small business.<p>At the same time, it's very possible to make something that people want and simply have no desire to scale. That's what I'm seeing for a lot of American startups. Yes, there are all the wide-eyed younger folks who are out to imitate Zuck and be the next Facebook, but for every one of those there are a hundred people out in the hinterland who aren't out to conquer the world.<p>Why? Lots of reasons. First, <i>people who change the world get punished.</i> They get punished by competitors, by the government, and sometimes even by the popular opinion of the people who use their startups. Why make yourself a target?<p>Second, a disruptive startup's relationship to the government is far from clear. Is AirBnB an appointment service or a hotel service? Do the guys that offer ride shares run a taxi business? Or a bulletin board? The government, over time, has come up with thousands of little boxes that businesses are supposed to fit inside. Depending on which box you fit in, various rules apply. What this has done is create lots of stovepipe business systems. So when a business comes along that crosses many boxes, which ones apply? A lawyer can help here, but she's just going to be able to offer an legal opinion, not protect you from possible problems.<p>Third, there's the big business overhead hit. There's a huge difference between 3 guys in a garage and 3 thousand guys in an IT center. You need all sorts of administrative resources for the IT center, and lots of training for management on how to act. That doesn't come overnight, and you don't get there without taking a productivity hit. Now, if you're Google and revenue figures give you the slack to know you're going to be around for a while, you take the dive and go through the hassle. But if you're some fly-by-night, just-getting-started business which might have a huge staff for just one year and then disband? You can't make the overhead numbers work. I can't go out and hire 3 thousand guys to build my human-powered recommender engine for next year. It'd take a year or more of scaling just to approach that level of staffing. And even then I'd probably screw it up. All those laws to make sure ""big business"" behaves properly have an assumption that the business is an ongoing concern -- they have lots of money and lots more on the way. That assumption is not always true.<p>Finally, even if you had an idea to conquer the world, do you really want to be an executive? You can be a Derek Sivers and have all the money you want and the lifestyle you choose, or you can spend your time managing bureaucratic systems and endless people problems. Does that second forty million spend any differently than the first forty? The <i>idea</i> of what it's like to be a business overlord and the reality are vastly different things. The smart choice for many might be to ditch the fast-growth and large-scale scene entirely.<p>I constantly see wonks who understand little bits and pieces of the startup scene -- that young, fast growing startups count more than small businesses in general, for instance -- yet miss out on huge chunks of what's really happening. They offer to tweak the existing environment by adding still further complexity, thinking they are helping out. They are not. There's not a lack of people creating business opportunities that are scalable. There's a lack of people wanting to scale businesses. Totally different thing.",1320143426

3181411,comment,3179505,3179540,6,0,geraldalewis,,,"Yes, though never enable strict mode (in JS) unless you know exactly what it does. `use strict` causes some subtle semantic shifts that can be easily overlooked. For example, there's no dynamic binding between the `arguments` object and a function's arguments:<p><pre><code>    ((x)-> x = 2; arguments[0] is 1)(1) # true

    ((x)-> arguments[0] = 2; x is 1)(1) # true

</code></pre>
Any developer enabling strict mode should be testing heavily in browsers that actually support the feature. There have been a few high-profile meltdowns already (on BoA, Intel, eBay, etc.) due to devs not understanding the feature, or concatenating a `""use strict""` script (not wrapped in an IIFE) with non-strict code.<p>JSLint doesn't help matters, as it errors unless `""use strict""` is declared (unless run with the ""sloppy"" option -- something I'm sure devs love). The absolute worst scenario is for a browser to implement some kind of heuristics-based approach to respect the `""use strict""` prologue; what Brendan Eich calls a ""strict quirks mode"".<p>All that said, I'm a big fan of `strict`. It might be a good idea to use it in production, and strip the directives out when deploying.",1320143000

Once that's clear, I write a proposal that outlines how I would address that problem, all in strictly high-level layman-understandable language - no mockups, no screenshots, no technical language, nothing. Then, once we agree on that, I contact a designer to help out with the design of the app, and to think about new and novels ways to make the interface as simple as possible. We show it to the customer, refine it, and get an agreement on all that stuff. And then, finally, three months since that first meeting, I can start with the programming.<p>So yes, I'm a programmer - but only if an academic is a writer, if an architect is someone who draws, and if a manager is someone who talks to people.",1320142718

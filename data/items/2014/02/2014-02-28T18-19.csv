In the case of a government-backed currency, there&#x27;s at least some value based on that government&#x27;s ability to mandate its use for taxes. Governments can manage that with varying degrees of success but any official currency has more intrinsic value that Bitcoin to the extent that the government has sovereign authority over a larger economy.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean that Bitcoin can&#x27;t be valued but it means that the community has to have a strategy to provide equivalent reassurances.",1393613931

7320723,comment,7320192,7320192,1,0,brudgers,,,"What Mt. Gox shows is that the integrity of bitcoin as a currency is somewhat dependent on the level of technical sophistication of &#x27;legitimate&#x27; bitcoin players versus the technical sophistication of &#x27;illegitimate&#x27; bitcoin players. If the bitcoin establishment isn&#x27;t the smartest people in the room, then can a person on the street trust them?<p>Anyone can put cash in their mattress and reasonably assess the risks. Likewise the risks associated with a bank are somewhat knowable.<p>But assessing the risks with crypto currency is almost impossible for even a reasonably sophisticated user. Under a rational actor model, bitcoin becomes attractive when the risk of not being able to assess the risk of bitcoins is less than the risk of using another form of transaction - e.g. Silk Road.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that bitcoin = Silk Road. But any bitcoin transaction has a higher probability of involving a party with fewer inhibitions against illegal activity. Will the person who uses bitcoins to avoid taxes on the income from AirBnB rentals rob you? Probably not. But as using bitcoin becomes a more compelling economic option, the activity is likely to be farther away from the bounds of law.<p>Amassing bitcoins makes sense when it is the best economic option and the scenarios in which that will always apply are speculation and legal burdens on other currencies. In neither of those cases is their a reason to trust the other party.",1393613899

Its value is so far beyond its actual usable-as-a-thing value that it really doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s zero or not.  If the gold market collapses, because that&#x27;s <i>completely possible</i>, it takes every stockpile down with it and everything they propped up.  Unless your argument includes that gold is stupid and not a currency, in which case we can at least agree we&#x27;re being consistent :)  It&#x27;s hard to argue in favor of Bitcoin if you&#x27;re not in favor of gold, and I&#x27;m not equipped to argue gold.<p>On the trust aspect: honestly, I trust algorithms more than governments.  1+1=2 has outlived every government in existence.  Plenty of governments have exploded violently and without general awareness until it happened and I see no reason why X won&#x27;t. &quot;Safe&quot; investments pop sometimes.  Bitcoin is undeniably much more <i>volatile</i>, but that doesn&#x27;t make it <i>untrustable</i> in the long run.<p>(for the record, my interest in Bitcoin is almost purely as a protocol.

In fact, central authorities eventually <i>recognized</i> the value of gold and silver, they didn&#x27;t declare it or bring it into being.<p>The really remarkable event, that cements the role of modern government in economic matters, was the relatively recent unlinking of paper money from the backing of gold and/or silver.

It&#x27;s not that bad as some would have you believe, but I like it less than Windows 7, and every release should be more enjoyable and better. I consider Windows 7 to be the best version of Windows ever. It has a pretty clean windowing UI, it&#x27;s stable and secure and generally just works.<p>It&#x27;s an OS that really appeals to MS&#x27;s core audience. Why mess with it?<p>I have my Windows 8 machine set to boot straight to desktop mode, and I have the start menu back; so it&#x27;s pretty similar to using Windows 7. But every now and then you accidentally open up an app or file in Metro mode, and it&#x27;s a really disorienting experience when one of my windows is in metro mode and the other is in desktop mode.<p>The core issue of Windows 8 is that it tries to merge two pretty good UI concepts together, and in the process makes both worse. I like Metro as a tablet and phone UI. I like the Windows 7 UI for desktop computing. It&#x27;s when you have to use Metro on a desktop or Windows 7 windowing on a tablet that it all goes to hell.<p>I would suggest that MS end this, and make Windows 9 the best traditional Windows it can. Aim it at businesses and people who want to use the same OS they use at work at home. Focus on networking and cloud support (take OneDrive even further), improving multithreaded support (make it easier for developers to harness 4-12 and more core computers) and improving the file system.<p>The UI concepts of Windows 7 are pretty good. You can iterate on the UI and add new features like Apple does with OS X, but there is no reason to get away from windowing for desktop computing. It&#x27;s a conceptual model that works well, particularly for power users and work that benefits from multiple-monitors and multitasking.<p>Microsoft should then spin off Metro into its own OS without the Windows name, while still using the Windows kernel. This is what Apple does with iOS, and it works very well.<p>I use OS X at home, and think Mavericks is what MS should be aiming for, not Windows 8. Mavericks is the best desktop OS I&#x27;ve ever used, and, while I really like iOS, I wouldn&#x27;t want to use iOS on my desktop computer.",1393611921

So it seems plausible to me.<p>On the other hand, I think I understand where this piece of satire is coming from. I was a military wife and full-time mom and homemaker for a long time. My dad was career military and grew up on a farm. I grew up with shotguns hanging on the wall of my parent&#x27;s bedroom. I have been around gun culture but I insisted my husband get rid of the handgun he had for a time because I am clear that if you are not prepared to kill someone when you pull a gun, you best not pull it because you are likely just arming your opponent and escalating the problems.<p>Escalating the arms race rarely leads to promoting the peace. It is unfortunate that satirical pieces of this sort so rarely follow up with commentary on how on promotes the peace after they lambast the idea of arming people to promote peace. But it seems to me that many people who recognize that more guns is not the solution do not know what <i>would be</i> an effective solution, so presumably they simply cannot offer anything more than criticism of the proposed solution.

Then, a similar organization like Coinbase would have even less incentive to keep their house in order. In the worst case scenario, they&#x27;ll just be bailed out too. And then there is the consumer, who will have no incentive to only bank with solvent institutions. Who cares? We&#x27;ve got FDIC. The amount of ignorance and moral hazard created by this style of system adds up pretty quickly.<p>The current bitcoin system is definitely messy. But when something goes wrong, the damage is largely contained. Mt Gox died. People who had value stored there lost it. But people with bitcoins are Coinbase were fine. And the average tax payer didn&#x27;t have to spend a dime.<p>All in all, I find the whole thing to be a fascinating test case for unregulated finances.

Perhaps you&#x27;re thinking of Thomas Insel, director of the NIMH, who has taken exactly the same position I have, and for exactly the same reason:<p><a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-diagnosis.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-dia...</a><p>Quote: &quot;While DSM has been described as a “Bible” for the field, it is, at best, a dictionary, creating a set of labels and defining each. The strength of each of the editions of DSM has been “reliability” – each edition has ensured that clinicians use the same terms in the same ways. <i>The weakness is its lack of validity</i>.&quot;<p>&quot;Unlike our definitions of ischemic heart disease, lymphoma, or AIDS, the DSM diagnoses are based on a consensus about clusters of clinical symptoms, <i>not any objective laboratory measure</i>. In the rest of medicine, this would be equivalent to creating diagnostic systems based on the nature of chest pain or the quality of fever. Indeed, symptom-based diagnosis, once common in other areas of medicine, has been largely replaced in the past half century as we have understood that symptoms alone rarely indicate the best choice of treatment. <i>Patients with mental disorders deserve better</i>.&quot; [emphasis added]<p>For the above reasons, the NIMH has recently ruled that the DSM may no longer be the basis of scientific research proposals, on the ground that it has no scientific content.<p>> ... parts of the field do have some serious issues, but to paint with such a broad brush and be so sure of yourself in casting dispersions [sic] on fields you have no formal training in is really gross to encounter.<p>Fair enough. Let&#x27;s see how your viewpoint stands up under scrutiny. Do you think astrology is a science? No? But you don&#x27;t have a degree in astrology -- doesn&#x27;t that disqualify you from having an opinion on this subject? My point is that, in science, authority counts for nothing, only evidence matters. To put this another way, in science, evidence means everything, reputation means nothing. The greatest amount of scientific eminence is trumped by the smallest amount of scientific evidence.<p>Also, the expression &quot;casting dispersions&quot; isn&#x27;t quite what you had in mind (s/dispersions/aspersions).<p>And finally, Allen Frances, editor of DSM-IV, has recently written a book that makes the same points I do (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Saving-Normal-Out-Control-Medicalization/dp/0062229257"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Saving-Normal-Out-Control-Medicalizati...</a>).<p>If NIMH director Insel, or Allen Frances, tried to post to r/askscience, they would get the same treatment I got -- scientific censorship.<p>More here: <a href=""http://arachnoid.com/building_science"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/building_science</a>",1393611227

The premise is that, at each step of the calculation, a function does some computation and returns a result.  At the point where the logging decision is being made, the decision is based on data <i>available within</i> the function, but not being <i>returned by</i> the function - only a derived value is returned.<p>Now, perhaps you could argue that the <i>right</i> way to do the problem (without the logging) in Haskell is to not have functions like that - to break up that function so that the data that, in my version, is only available within the function is instead explicitly returned by some smaller function.<p>But if you don&#x27;t argue that, then you&#x27;re left with the stated problem:  What&#x27;s the right way of getting logging out of the middle of a function in Haskell?",1429725423

It seems today that most conventional farm operations are fairly large (speaking from my experience in the Midwest). Not only would they need to restructure their operations, they would also need to scale down significantly. So we would actually need <i>more</i> farmers. Not to mention that Salatin&#x27;s region is well suited for raising animals. I would venture to guess that farmers in arid regions would not fare as well.<p>Furthermore, this still wouldn&#x27;t meet our demands. Salatin talks about seasonality; there are certain times of the year when it makes sense to slaughter cows, chickens, pigs, etc. We demand all of these meats even when they are out of season. It wasn&#x27;t to long ago that we reserved beef for special occasions. Now some people eat beef multiple times a day on a consistent basis.<p>>><i>That kind of competitive advantage might make it possible for start-up farms to grow and slowly buy out retiring farmers so that no tremendous upheaval is necessary for new ideas to become the norm.</i><p>I am hoping that something like this will happen, but Wall Street is also interested in this land[0]. We need to decrease our demand in the cheap, convenient food that Wall Street makes money off of and increase our demand in high quality, local food. If we do this then our demand for meat will also decrease because we will start to eat with the seasons in mind.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/more-individuals-are-looking-to-invest-in-farmland-and-timberland-1405706090"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wsj.com/articles/more-individuals-are-looking-to-...</a>",1429725311

But bad DevOps is basically no worse than what people were doing before: you&#x27;d just have a bunch of VMs running fedora20 with no way of easily patching all of them at once. Except some of the VMs may be running fedora23 because they were part of an expansion that happened 2 years after the original set and the guy who deployed them couldn&#x27;t find a fedora20 image. And at least with a container, you can more easily use AWS for spare capacity/redundancy while you migrate servers. DevOps doesn&#x27;t fix every sysadmin problem, but it gives you a lot more options that can be developed/deployed in a small amount of time.<p>DevOps is bad when you take your worst developer and say &quot;do sysadmin tasks and still write application code&quot;. It works much better when you take an experienced sysadmin and embed them into a dev team. Make them do code reviews on deployment scripts with a developer, assign tasks within sprints, etc. Code reviews aren&#x27;t because you don&#x27;t know how to code -- IMO the primary benefit of code reviews is the education of the reviewer. Likewise, the sysadmin&#x27;s struggles become the developers&#x27; struggles, and the developers are more likely to write applications that are easy to support if they have some role in supporting them.<p>Every company over a certain size has politics. It&#x27;s unavoidable. Maybe Google doesn&#x27;t -- I don&#x27;t know. But not every company can be Google. You can&#x27;t use technology to overcome process problems, but you can and should use technology as a part of a redesigned, better process. DevOps gives you more options, and has a positive effect on the culture of a development org. It asks them to think of portability and supportability as a concern.",1429725083

Maybe I&#x27;m weird but in my work this has caught legitimate dead code exactly zero times, but has triggered false positives due to transient debugging changes eleventy bazillion times.

Anyway, a couple things.<p>First: the claim is that the world&#x27;s economic base is <i></i>shifting<i></i> to the Asia Pacific - not that it is already there. One reason for this is that these (huge) economies are emerging into consumer rather than producer economies and another that much of the modern industrial capacity for 21st century goods (e.g. electronics) are centered in this area. The Renminbi is a credible threat to the dollar.<p>The second thing is that this is the perception of the Western world - it is the reason for the Bush and Obama administrations&#x27; joint plan for the Pivot to Asia. Maybe our government is wrong - but this perspective is what informs it and is leading its decisions.<p>The third thing of course is that your dossier is very coarse. It fails to mention the problems in the Eurozone and the financial crashes centered around the dollar. It casts the Spanish economy in good light and the Chinese one as bad. It mentions Canada&#x27;s growth, but not that it has been driven by investment in China. Curiously, it uses Japan as a comparison for the US economy - a country I would consider on the Western system - and later uses Japan as an example of why the Asia Pacfic is weak.<p>Finally, economics have more to do with growth than they do with wealth. It does not matter that Asia is not (so) wealthy right now. What matter is that the growth is and will be centered in the Asia Pacific. The investment, global investment, will be there. Everyone wants a piece of the 7%+ pie. This while the Western world, while rich, is struggling to grow at 2%. It is not enough to look at who has the wealth - you need to look at who will be getting wealth.<p>What Washington thinktanks are talking about right now is:<p>- How can we get the Japanese people to agree with expanded US military deployment there?<p>- Can we get S. Korea to reunify with N. Korea, what would China think, and what are the prospects for Korea to become a world power?<p>- What broad power plays are going to be made by Xi Jingping? How can we prevent China from gaining control of the major ocean trade routes?<p>- What investments can the Western World make in Eurasia? Can a strong partnership with India, with its emerging economy and large population, enable us to compete in the region? How can we keep India off of the AIIB (esp. wrt coal)?<p>(And of course a great number of things not related to the Asia Pacific, like how to keep the Arctic as a no-man&#x27;s land)<p>So anyway, I&#x27;m not actually making the claim that the Asia Pacific is going to be the center for economic growth of the world for the next 40 years.

To give credit to Xiaomi, they&#x27;re setting up themselves a very high bar when they set out to imitate Apple. Google tried it with its initial launch of Android, and if it weren&#x27;t for M Duarte joining Google in the wake of Palm falling apart, who knows how Android would have looked today.

But we find the first difference with the US here.<p>Getting a bit of money is easy enough, maybe something below 500K€ is feasible. But there&#x27;s no way you are going to get the valuations and the money raised by similar startups in the valley.<p>Most VCs here are pretty risk-averse, so that&#x27;s an extra hurdle, but there&#x27;s a lot of other VC operating on both sides of the ocean that are sometimes more approachable and the networks of angel investors work really well.<p>For me, the real problem is growth.

The market sees the trade with a higher price and the stock increases. This has resulted in some large profits for swing trades, somewhat due to believing in Tesla&#x27;s fundamentals and in Elon Musk. Some institutional investors don&#x27;t share my friends views, and trade Tesla stock down. It is legal because the trade was made in good faith, and not trying to &quot;deceive&quot; the market using bogus trades.<p>In traditional HFT, the legal justification for fast trades that in some cases were never intended to be filled, is murky at best. As long as the market stays reasonably stable and the big boys profit, the complaints are somewhat muted.<p>A friend in the same group, who also trades Tesla, was on the console during the flash crash. It was &quot;obvious&quot; that these automated trade bots were unloading, and there was not major news (eg. GM bankruptcy) to justify the sudden price drop in specific stocks. Her console showed &quot;black swan&quot; type data, and she switched to an option trade as stocks caught up in the flash event wouldn&#x27;t stay down for long. The options that were &quot;out of the money&quot; (almost worthless) became valuable when the stocks rebounded.<p>What caused the actual flash crash (triggered by futures trades or not) was a phenomenon called &quot;exponential backoff&quot; with a large automated trading bot closing out its trades, triggered by stocks below a certain price, causing downward pressure on the stocks, and the market. Another automated trade bot sees this, and also closes out its position. This automated close out then occurs exponentially, and the market goes into a &quot;death spiral&quot; crash.<p>Note: I do not own stock in Tesla.

Most important is cost: Your time is expensive but system downtime can be incredibly costly. [1] You need to anticipate and prevent the problem in the first place (you are the expert!), have resources prepared in case of failure (including expert knowledge of the system), and resolve it quickly. Also, you are paid as an expert to get results that boost the bottom line. You can&#x27;t spend a day fiddling around with something and gratifying your curiosity.<p>3) There is a very wide range of knowledge and skill among sysadmins. You don&#x27;t need a license to do it; anyone can print &quot;System Administrator&quot; on their business card. There are many, many ignorant hacks; lots of decent ones who don&#x27;t think beyond what they are told; and few true experts. Who you surround yourself with will determine, to a great extent, where you fall in that range. You probably will adopt their standards and you will learn their way of doing things; you can spend your time learning either the knowledge and techniques of the hacks or those of the experts.<p>4) Invest the time and effort to learn core technologies [2] exhaustively and to learn best practices. Never shy away from difficult technical material; push yourself to find the best sources and develop skill to understand complex material. Most of what&#x27;s on the Internet is bullsh-t from and for amatuer hackers, good enough for your home server. You can spend your career without understanding much of what you are doing -- there&#x27;s enough work out there for the hacks too. Find the very best sources and people (see #3), and take the time to learn from them. Learn something once and it pays off forever.<p>5) Learn to solve problems. Worry less about learning techniques (e.g., arcane details of command line switches); anyone can look those up. The real challenge is staring at a screen, seeing something that you have no idea about (and which is not in books or on the Internet), and finding a way to solve it (with all the time and other pressures mentioned above). To do that, you need a model in your mind, a deep understanding, of the technologies and systems involved (see #4).<p>6) Put yourself in situations where you will be in command of the situation and with time in reserve for making major enhancements, learning more, and for unexpected crises; not where you are struggling to keep up with a flood problems, frantically treading water (or slowly drowning). Also choose situations where you are prepared to handle the worst-case scenarios: When the sh-t hits the fan -- when all your plans and normal operations go to hell -- people will look to you to save them. Be their hero. (See #5.)<p>It can be a very intellectually stimulating and gratifying job. In every field, good people and true experts are hard to find. Make yourself into one and you will be in good shape.<p>---------<p>[1] Consider the cost of 1,000 people not working (avg hourly rate * 1,000 * hours), hours of orders missed, facilities shut down because your system is the bottleneck, deadlines missed, angry customers, embarassment to the business and its executives, etc.<p>[2] What the core technologies are for you will vary.

Canada has become vastly stronger over that time, it has as large of an economy as India with just 2.7% of the population (with not even a small fraction of the problems that India faces).<p>Mexico&#x27;s GDP has doubled in 15 years.

In the last 20 years that Japan has been treading water and taking on vast debt, Germany&#x27;s economy has doubled in size post re-unification.<p>Most of the best countries in the world in terms of high standard of living are in Europe.<p>Meanwhile the Asia Pacific region has nearly two billion people living in what can only be described as intense poverty by Western standards. China alone has ~600 million unemployed captive &#x27;farmers&#x27; earning $3 / day, because there are no other jobs for those people to do.<p>Japan is in such dire condition 40% of their budget goes to paying interest on their debt, their GDP hasn&#x27;t grown in 20 years, and they&#x27;ve gotten so desperate they&#x27;ve taken to aggressively debasing the Yen to keep their government solvent (rapidly chopping down the Japanese standard of living in the process).

The market is constantly moving. From where do they get the superpower of always having stuff to sell, or always being able to buy?

From one fan to another, I&#x27;m curious: what things are you specifically thinking of?<p>For me, one of anime&#x27;s most engrossing qualities was the multi-episode stories. Back in the 90s there weren&#x27;t a lot of American TV shows (outside of soap operas) that had the multi-episode story arcs that were common in anime; typically everything was always wrapped up in a single episode.<p>Today, the American TV shows with the most rabid followings (like Game of Thrones) have latched on to exactly that addictive quality. I&#x27;m not entirely sure we can give anime credit for innovating here, though - after all, American soap operas were doing multi-episode stories since literally the dawn of television.<p><pre><code>  > Ghibli accomplishes what Disney/Pixar seems to have forgotten:

But today we’re in the same situation with most of our political leaders and programming: Obama was able to remember at least that bubble sort was the wrong way to sort a million integers, but didn’t even come close to the constant-time radix sort you’d want to use (if we’re talking about fixnums, not bignums).  A lot of people will use this situation to argue that dictatorship is better than democracy, since Singapore has dictatorship and smart leaders, while the democratic world generally has programming-illiterate leaders (except Merkel, apparently), but that seems to be more a coincidence than anything else — Lee’s level of competence is as much an anomaly among dictators as it would be among democratic leaders.<p>Political leadership (whether in a democracy or in a dictatorship) is about persuading people to cooperate with each other, not about reading and writing, except perhaps as a means to that persuasion, and not about programming, either.  But the extent to which you can rightly aim your cooperative efforts depends crucially on your understanding of the world in which they will play out, and when it comes to that, political leaders lacking basic informatics competence are as mentally crippled in the 21st century as an illiterate political leader like Charlemagne would have been in the 19th.

Though I don&#x27;t disagree with any of the criticisms or other comments at this level, for some of us MongoDB has been pretty good in production and we haven&#x27;t experienced data loss. It all depends on your use case.<p>My first experience with it was for a social game running off of 3 mongo servers in a replica set & here at a large healthcare company we use it for several internal CRUD applications (again in 3-server replica sets) which we continue to iterate. In these use cases, Mongo&#x27;s flexibility and ease of making changes trumped it&#x27;s shortcomings. My understanding is that many social games still use Mongo to store player data as our studio was told to use it by a large publisher.<p>My take is that it&#x27;s good for building prototypes and it&#x27;s pretty flexible to both change & migrate data in and out & Javascript devs pick it up relatively quickly. But I also think one should be well aware of it&#x27;s shortcomings and be careful not to use it where those things are of importance. More often than anything else, I recommend PostgreSQL when other people ask for a general-use db but I&#x27;d likely would pick up Mongo myself simply for speed of development.<p>Lastly, being part of the &quot;MEAN stack,&quot; we can point junior devs & interns to one of the many books that cover the stack & they can learn best practices get up to speed quickly.  There&#x27;s an advantage to having books & a slew of SO answers to refer to in that other devs aren&#x27;t pulled off of their work to teach. We literally had interns committing code on Day 1 of their jobs last summer as they came in having read up on our stack.<p>Regarding claims MongoDB has made, which I&#x27;ve only been made aware of the last two days, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any defending that & it makes my itch to checkout rethinkdb a bit stronger than it was 2 days ago.",1429722032

This has everything to do with your particular situation; you've already worked at a big company, you'd be joining Google in a sales capacity instead of an engineering capacity, and you like and trust the founders of the startup.<p>In general you want to optimize for learning experiences.  You can get certain learning experiences at Google that you can't anywhere else - but the difference is much less in sales (where things may run a bit more smoothly, you may be introduced to some interesting systems) than in engineering (where there's certain knowledge that you just <i>can't get</i> anywhere other than Google).  You've already done the big company thing; Google will have better perks than Shell, it may pay better, but it's not going to be fundamentally different.<p>BizDev in a startup, however, will expose you to all sorts of challenges that you don't face in a big company.

3496137,comment,3494636,3495247,3,0,cwzwarich,,,"The Completeness Theorem (in one of its equivalent forms) says that every consistent first-order theory has a model, linking syntax and semantics. It doesn't tell you any thing about how you would go about justifying that a theory is consistent.<p>People hoped that some logical system capable of formalizing real mathematics would be able to justify its own consistency. Godel's Incompleteness Theorem (and stronger, related results) imply that any system capable of formalizing real mathematics (or even a very weak subset of it) can not justify its own consistency, requiring an appeal to a stronger system. Obviously, that raises the obvious question of why that stronger system is consistent. There are constructive proofs (due to Godel himself, Gentzen, and others) of the consistency of Peano Arithmetic, but by the Incompleteness Theorem they must all be non-finitary in some fashion, no matter how slight.<p>However, there are some limits to this understanding of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem. There are theories that are strong enough to prove (and perhaps more importantly, state) their own consistency but not strong enough to formalize diagonalization. If PA is consistent, then there is a theory that can state and prove its own consistency as well as the consistency of PA. The trick is that provability can be formalized on the basis that subtraction and division are total functions, whereas diagonalization requires addition and multiplication to be total functions. These theories can prove that subtraction and division are total functions, but not addition and multiplication.",1327224686

My boss once told me ""everybody knows who the subset of people who get shit done is"", and in some ways, my loyalty is to them rather than the company as an entity (it just so happens that most of them still work at Google).  I mourn whenever we lose another coworker who does awesome stuff.  If I were to join Parse, it'd be so I could work with Kevin again, and if I were to join Asana, it'd be so I could work with Jackie again, and if I were to join YCombinator, it'd be so I could learn from PB & company.<p>I'm guessing that this isn't how most outsiders see Google, since in general people don't claim credit for the work they've done at Google unless they're associated with really big-name projects.  But I think there's definitely some truth to the view of a corporation as composed of individuals, some of whom are good and some of whom are bad.",1327223958

If your wife's breast feeding get her to express from 2 months onwards and you can then get 'shifts' where she does breast feeding during the nights and you take the early morning ones feeding via expressed bottle. You can plan extended coding sessions between these feeds without feeling guilty<p>- look into making batches of food you can freeze and heat up - stuff lie, pies, lasagne etc and load them up with veggies, you can then just zap them in microwave as you'll probably not have time for anything else, I made up a months worth of food.<p>- be prepared for lots of visitors and make sure they're aware that when your in your office your not to be disturbed, I kept coming out to say hello and it's easy to lose a few hours a day that way<p>- look into the baby Einstein DVDs - they're like baby crack and give you both 30 mins to jump in the shower/grab something to eat<p>- swap the runs for walking the baby, I take mine for 3-4 mile walks after the morning and leave the wife to catch up on sleep.",1327223487

But it's done in a way that is not really noticeable; or if it is, Google has selected for the type of person who won't complain too much.  It's very much a boiling frog situation.  Ultimately it's not ""wrong"" or ""against the law"" - as you said, if a person finds her present economic situation unviable, she can go elsewhere.  But that's a really big step down from their supposed ""Do No Evil"" policy.  Google built up a huge amount of brand equity amongst tech employees; now they appear to be spending it, so it's important that we properly debit their account.",1327223373

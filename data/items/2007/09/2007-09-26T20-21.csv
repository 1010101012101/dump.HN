The only feature change that improved the facebook/brought in more people was the newsfeed and that was only after initially running into a huge resistance against it from within the community.  <p>Hustling to find a way to monetize the users by continuing to add features isn't going to get them far. What else could be done to dramatically alter the experience and generate more people or more activity?  I think the success has gone to Mark's head and agree that he should cash out now.  <p>Not to say that it won't be a service used by millions for years to come, but the model for growth seems to have hit it's peak.",1190840347

That's all. I can probably write a compiler that translates this to SQL if necessary. Nice thing is that when I write this piece I don't care about how exactly data is stored and accessed.<p>Now let's compare it with your SQL solution.

59991,comment,59837,59932,0,0,palish,,,"For what it's worth, it worked for me.  I dropped out of high school (I was failing anyway) and ""apprenticed"" at my place of work when I was 17, two years ago.  For about 8 months I wasn't paid, then I was hired.  Over the last 6 months I feel I've contributed very nicely to the company's project.<p>The problem is a lot of employers aren't as nice as mine was.  In fact, I doubt he would have let me come on had he known the full extent of what he was getting into.  I asked questions like mad about the project until I had a knowledge base wide enough to really sit down and figure things out for myself.  This translated directly into lost time for one employee (My mentor, Andy.  He's an awesome guy).  But in the end they have another productive employee.<p>I'd say the company's happiness with me strongly resembles this graph, minus the falloff at the end:  <a href=""http://www.tylerreed.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/the-ebb-and-flow-of-social-networking.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tylerreed.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/the-eb...</a><p>So a company would have to be extremely patient to do something like that.  And the downside for me is that I don't have a degree.  That doesn't matter in terms of raw ability, but it does matter for salary and other employment options.

The ""poor"" here have access to free libraries where they could learn pretty much whatever they want.  They can access the Internet for free.  They can get a $10 an hour job at a fast food restaurant to pay the bills. Yes, it's not glamorous but it's a start.  The resources are out there if they want to find them.<p>When you've seen child of 6 years old who probably does not have parents, who is living on the streets and who is drugged up on sniffing glue, poverty takes on a whole new meaning.

59984,comment,59794,59931,0,0,dfranke,,,"It's frustrating how many smart people agree with ardit33's argument, though.  I've even heard the same thing from spez.  When you're mostly writing CRUD queries, you can get away with just treating the DB as a hash table, but it still means you're probably doing a lot of things inefficiently.  The database needs of the company I work for now are just run-of-the-mill web app stuff, but still it's just another day at the office when I write an SQL query that could easily translate to 100 LOC worth of hash table operations.
Here's a real example from our forum code that I've used as a job interview question: each user is member of some set of groups (groups in the UNIX sense), and each forum requires membership in all of some set of groups in order to be allowed to post.  Given a userid, return the set forums to which that user is allowed to post.  You can do it with a single, concise SQL statement containing nested existential quantifiers, and the query plan it generates is very fast.",1190837814

59974,comment,59894,59894,0,0,timr,,,"This is an interesting question to me, as I know someone who is actively making the rounds with these angel cartels.<p>My impression is that these are just VCs in angel costumes.  You have to do all of the work and business development that you would need to do to pitch a VC, but the dollar amounts are much lower.  The funding terms may or may not be good (my friend hasn't gotten a term-sheet yet), but the terminology is suspiciously similar to the VC world, and most of these groups' members seem to be VCs as well.<p>On the whole, it isn't clear that these organizations are worth the effort for the money involved.  You're not going to have a chance with them if you're <i>truly</i> seed-stage (i.e. you probably won't make it past the telephone screen unless you have a really mature business plan), but if you're that far along as a business, then it's questionable that angel investment is the right strategy.<p>I think, perhaps, that these cartels are just a clever way for VCs to make themselves more relevant in a world where their services are less and less essential....

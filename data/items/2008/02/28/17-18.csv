I like asymmetric web pages, but the design of that website just hurts. To actually get through the first page of my article I moved my laptop right so I was focusing propelry instead of looking to one side of my screen constantly.<p>The article takes up less than 50% of the area of the screen, which just squeezes it out of perceptibility. So I never got through the article, I'm sure it was good or it wouldn't have been posted but it was awfully presented. Poor writer, I hope he got paid well for people being unable to read his work.",1204221271

Not a big entrepreneurship culture in the CS department, but I think you can make that happen if that's what you want to do.<p>College is all about the people. Find the one with the people you like the best and respect the most. You'll figure out the rest while you are there.",1204220818

It looks good, but I get an ""I've seen this before"" feeling. If you're targeting English and Chinese speakers, it could be cool to incorporate that into the design, probably to the extent that non-Chinese speakers can safely parse the characters as ""icons"" though.<p>You definitely need something that makes it standout. Why shouldn't I just write down my dreams or post them on my blog? I could see some cool text pattern recognition features encouraging me to post a dream; that is, who else had a dream like this last night/ever? You mention natural language processing, so perhaps you've already got something like that in mind...<p>Being able to reply to individual dreams might be annoying, though maybe we could post ""interpretations"" (in the Freudian sense).",1204220626

The debt is what will imprison you, and colleges aren't worth anything near what they cost.""<p>Remember that many private colleges give really generous financial aid if your parents are not wealthy.  Stanford is free if you make under $100K; Amherst has abolished all loans in financial aid, so it's free for those making under about $40-50K and quite reasonably priced (often less than a state uni) for those making under $100K.<p>My actual tuition at Amherst was only slightly more than the sticker price at UMass; my sister's at Rice was less.  Now, granted it's not really a fair comparison, since I would've gotten a full-ride at UMass Amherst (and UMass Lowell offered to <i>pay</i> me to attend).  But I'd look long and hard at the scholarship options available before discounting a top college based on price.",1204220562

But the MS attack seems still obvious.<p>SharePoint is growing massively in recent months, but its a fairly monstrous thing. Think ""corporate IT"". They want ""customizability"", even though in the end its going to cost them more than the initial licenses.<p>Anyway, Google is now supposed to be a Big Software Corporation, so it needs to compete with other Big Software Corporations in every area.

125559,comment,125317,125440,0,0,DocSavage,,,"I don't think any intelligent person thinks these places have a monopoly on ideas or a guaranteed path to success. Your point samples on MIT/Harvard people don't buttress your argument any more than my encounters with very creative people who were so smart that strong standardized scores were a natural offshoot of their abilities. We <i>can</i> say there are both bright people and uncreative people at universities.<p>Yes, people can develop no matter where they study.  I don't see anyone arguing that other places are the entrepreneurial equivalent of raising babies without light.  The post's question was ""best"" place for a given aspiring tech entrepreneur.<p>Location is key because ""great faculty and programs"" aren't just within the university.  They include the guest angel investor speaking at a seminar, the Ruby hackers-entrepreneurs at the local gathering, the founders presenting at one of the many local showcases.  They include events like YC Startup School, which I would probably not attend if I went to school in Virginia.<p>Bottom line: Go to the place most conducive to your entrepreneurial aspirations that you can attend without troubling debt.  Then make the most of your choice.",1204219077

The geeks, techies, friends and family that initially use your product are not representative of the public at large. Their opinions on your product are not representative of what the mainstream will think.”<p>I suppose most people want to use their hacking skills to make something useful in their domain of expertise.

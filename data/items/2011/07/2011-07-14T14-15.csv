Currently, Facebook and Twitter users do not have a way of managing their accounts while they are away or unavailable. Users can either deactivate their Twitter and Facebook accounts or ignore incoming communications.<p>Taking a Break solves this problem (it introduces a new Social Networking Etiquette) by allowing a user to schedule breaks from Facebook and Twitter, and it politely sends auto replies to all incoming communications on behalf of the user, when the user is break.<p>http://takingabreakapp.com<p>Much Thanks to YCombinator.<p>My Google+ (where I definitely have my Hacker News Circle):

2763272,comment,2761788,2761788,3,0,WillyF,,,"I submitted this because I'm a ""victim"" of Panda, and this article did a good job of explaining the frustration I'm dealing with.<p>A lot of the commenters seem to feel that Google doesn't owe webmasters anything. I disagree. Every time a SERPs page shows up with my site in the results, Google is selling advertising on top of my content. I gave them permission to use snippets of my content in return for sending whatever traffic they think should be sent my way. It's a mutually beneficial relationship (though they definitely hold most of the power), but it's certainly not a gift. We can both pull out of the deal at any time, but there's no reason to since we're both profiting from it.<p>I run sites to help college students find jobs and internships. One is called One Day, One Job and the other is One Day, One Internship. Every day I write about a new company. It's usually 400-600 words and I talk about what the company does, who they are, why they're interesting, and what kind of entry level jobs or internships they have. I get thank you notes from readers every day. I've helped put dozens of people into jobs they never would have found without my help. I get a ton of praise from college career services offices. There's certainly a consensus that my content is extremely high quality, useful, and something that Google would want searchers to find.<p>I've made SEO an important part of my strategy. I've optimized my pages, reworked my site architecture, and built a ton of high quality links. I've also done a lot of keyword research to try and better understand the psychology of a job seeker whose main tool for finding jobs is the Internet. I've tried a lot of other marketing techniques. I keep coming back to SEO. It's the absolute best way to reach job seekers. I've always followed Google's rules as closely as possible. I keep up with what Matt Cutts is saying and what Google is posting on their Webmaster Central blog. I'm not trying to game the search engines, I'm just trying to make the most of the opportunity that they offer to expand the reach of my content.<p>One Day, One Job got hit by Panda on February 24th. One Day, One Internship was never hit. Because the sites are nearly identical (including a lot of posts that are 90-95% shared content), it seemed weird that one would get hit and the other wouldn't. I figured out quickly that it had to be some sort of duplicate content issue. For a long time Google has said that duplicate content was not something that would be penalized--they'd just filter out anything that looks to be a duplicate. I found that One Day, One Job would rank for job related queries, and One Day, One Internship would rank for internship related queries. Rarely would they both show up on the first page for a given search term.<p>The reason that I built two separate sites was that I thought it was the best choice for my users. Job seekers and internship seekers are looking for slightly different things, so why not build separate sites and e-mail lists for them. I'm not trying to manipulate anything. I'm just trying to serve two mostly separate audiences with very similar content. Google assured me this wasn't a problem--and if it was they'd just show the user the most relevant result.<p>Google messed up with Panda. Even though One Day, One Job always gets the content first, has more and stronger incoming links, and has been around longer than One Day, One Internship, it got the penalty. One Day, One Internship is not the canonical source, but Google thinks it is.<p>So far I've been unable to fix this. I tried linking all duplicated posts on One Day, One Internship to the corresponding post on One Day, One Job to tell Google that it was the original source. I gave this over a month to set in, yet saw no results. Now I've used rel=""canonical"" to give Google a strong signal that One Day, One Job posts should be seen as canonical. It killed my One Day, One Internship traffic, and One Day, One Job has not seen any benefit yet. I'm waiting to see if it will eventually start working, but I'm not very hopeful.<p>My next step may be combining the two sites. I'd prefer not to, but it might make the most sense. I probably should have built the two as one site from the start, but I liked the idea of having two separate, but connected brands. That decisions shouldn't matter as much as it does now.<p>I strongly believe that Google's search results are worse without my content ranking as well as it used to. Obviously I'm biased, but I think most of my site's users would agree. My traffic on One Day, One Job is down 30-40% from where it was, and I've generated thousands of dollars less in revenue than I would have without the Panda penalty.<p>I don't doubt that Panda had an overall positive effect on the search ecosystem, but it really sucks for those who have worked hard to play by Google's rules. The repeated contradictions have caused me to follow paths that I may not have otherwise chosen.<p>Traffic from Google is extremely valuable to me. I'm willing to bend over backward to get it, but how do I do that when they are completely unclear about what they want (or even worse when they're very clear about what they want and then they change their mind)? I've been through their ""guidance on building high quality sites"" (see here: <a href=""http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2011/05/more-guidance-on-building-high-quality.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2011/05/more-guid...</a>). I know that I've built an extremely high quality site. Panda was a huge setback for my business. 5 months later I still haven't recovered, though I've tried a number of things that one would think would work. What do I do? I can't give up on Google. It's too important.",1310654918

2763263,comment,2762573,2763128,1,0,eropple,,,"""Progressiveness in design"" only works when people are actually able to view it correctly. Given the fluctuating state of HTML5 at present, I'm reasonably sure you're just introducing additional complexity and points of failure unless you are teaching exhaustively only the exact features that work correctly, everywhere. This is not a particularly large set.<p>Now, I'd say something very different if HTML5 actually worked correctly everywhere, or even most places. But here's the thing--indoctrinating people into a JavaScript dependency like modernizr to fuel your desire to use a standard that isn't completely implemented anywhere is, frankly, terrible: a much more important lesson to drive home is ""look, use progressive enhancement,"" not ""look, HTML5 is awesome!"", and making modernizr a dependency is the exact opposite of smart. Yes, your ""web agency"" might do this--but that doesn't make them very bright, either.<p>It's rule #1 of responsive web design: <i>start with the simplest base case, and progressively enhance from there</i>.

The first is that when I'm listening to Rdio at work (which is where I use the service most often) the stream tends to hang up and/or ""stutter"", to the point that I eventually get frustrated and turn it off. Now, we have pretty decent bandwidth at work, and other similar services (e.g. Pandora) don't seem to suffer from this problem, so I'm not sure what Rdio's problem is.<p>The other problem I've observed with Rdio is that a noticeable amount of time passes between the time I press ""play"" and the music actually starts. This one's not such a big problem, but it is a problem.<p>So, I've just signed up for a Spotify Unlimited plan and I'm going to see how it stacks up, especially with regards to the aforementioned problems.

And I know it is possible, because we're already at it and there is no magical barrier stopping us from doing this on a biological level. I also don't believe that ""we shouldn't do it because it makes us less sad when dying people have wrinkles and white hair"" is an ethically valid argument against this kind of research.<p>There are two viewpoints that make any further discussion pointless. One would be the belief in any sort of afterlife, and the other one is the conviction that human consciousness has at best a very limited intrinsic value and can hence be discarded without further consequence. If you don't hold one of these beliefs, I wager there is a high degree of probability that you basically agree with people like me that we have to do something and that things cannot should how they are now.<p>Of course, this kind of technology <i>will</i> over time lead to drastically longer lives as well. When it comes to aging, there is no way to do the quality thing without the quantity thing.<p>Overpopulation is not a problem in wealthy, industrial countries. These countries will always have advanced tech before everyone else. So, for example, if I were to live 200 years in Germany, producing maybe 0.8 children over the entire time, I'm not crowding up the countryside. Sure, I do require resources, as does everyone else, including some Bangladeshi guy who died at 35 because of some horrible tropical disease und who nevertheless multiplied by a factor of 20 over the same 200 years.<p>We need new and sustainable technologies to cope with both corner cases anyway. This idea that progress has to stop now is a horrible mistake. We left the realm of our fellow animal sisters and brothers to embark on a journey of knowledge and discovery. In the course of this endeavor, we became powerful individual minds capable of achieving pretty much anything. Well, we're halfway there now, we can't just stop suddenly, that would be the end of the race. We have to move all the way through to the other side.",1310653456

I personally support progressiveness in design, and that means if someone is using IE6 and/or no javascript, I do not support this (and neither does google, wordpress, and a host of other large companies). As long as you have javascript turned on, the simple inclusion of modernizr makes html5 100% functional. I think it would be a best practices fail NOT to teach html5. I always have coded in html5, and so has the web agency I work at, and anyone else I know in web dev.<p>On the dev, you're totally right, but I disagree with the statement ""There is really no reason for a designer to know about how MVC works"". The more a designer knows about development, the better they will be to work with. I don't think there should be a split between design and development, it's good to dabble in both.

The ads tend to be expensive when you first get an estimate from Facebook, but in practice, this number goes down 5-fold.  Also, in comparison to Adwords, it is at least 5-fold cheaper.<p>2) Easier to target people.  This depends on what you are doing, but I believe it works better if you are trying to build a community with a specific interest.  However, Adwords is probably better for targeting advertising for an e-commerce store.<p>3) If you advertise your fan page, you have a hook to constantly advertise to your fans.  I like building my fan page, generating conversation, and sparking interest.  It is important to give users good content, but it also doesn't hurt to self promote about 10-20% of the time.

If we solve the latter in tandem, then I'm on board.<p>Or are you <i>only</i> talking about quality-of-life improvements, rather than lengthening life expectancy? Assuming this is even possible, I think the problem with it would be the psychological toll of a death to the survivors - while always sad, the death of an elderly loved one is less jarring than the death of a loved one in their prime (""it was his time"") - so keeping everyone in their prime right up until their death would eliminate a powerfully useful coping mechanism.",1310652225

It didn't matter, because I did whatever was necessary and within my power.<p>Interestingly, others had opinions on the title, but they seemed to be aimed at making their future resume look better rather than anything at the current company.  That seems disloyal, but nobody stays at the same company forever these days.  Getting a nice title was just an improvement for the inevitable future.",1310652189

See <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html</a><p>Your open-source heart rate monitor will arguably directly help more people than the proprietary ones (don't confuse open-source with gratis) because it can serve as a base for other solutions to different problems. What you actually did by developing your open-source equivalent was to employ your resources in a much more efficient way, distributing its returns across a much wider field.<p>It's true you hurt the very limited group of people who made proprietary monitors, but you benefited a much, much larger group much more than they could ever do.",1310652148

1055866,comment,1055465,1055465,0,0,dkarl,,,"I share his stylistic preferences, but Zinsser is a prick.  (How's that for simple and forceful?)  He's a prick suffering from a bad case of déformation professionnelle.  (Ha!  That isn't even English!)  To further express my disdain for his advice, I have made my response extremely long.<p>Consider his first example:<p><i>“Dear member: The board of governors has spent the past year considering proactive efforts that will continue to professionalize the club and to introduce efficiencies that we will be implementing throughout 2009.” That means they’re going to try to make the club run better.</i><p>His translation is incomplete.  ""Better"" isn't a synonym for ""more professionally and efficiently.""  ""Better"" could mean all kinds of things.  Perhaps it would be plainer to say they're trying to cut down on waste and sloppiness, but that may not be accurate either.  Waste and sloppiness are relative to a person's awareness and capabilities.  Perhaps raising their their awareness and capabilities to the point where they recognized waste and sloppiness in their operation was part of the process.  That would be rather complicated to explain, but if they refer to ""waste and sloppiness"" then the reader is likely to get the impression that the waste and sloppiness have long been evident.<p>He also didn't communicate the time frame:  they've spent a year discussing what to do, and now they're going to spend a year (or whatever remains of 2009) doing it.  Whatever.  He doesn't care.  Their version communicates that they've done a lot of careful work to plan the improvements; he prefers a version that implies they don't know what they're doing.  How easy it is to be concise when you want your readers to lose confidence in you.<p>Could he really write what they wanted to say more concisely?  Probably so.  There are some obvious improvements to make.  But he refuses to try or even to offer any useful advice, because he doesn't give a shit about what they wanted to say, or what they were trying to accomplish by sending the letter.  He has contempt for the task they are faced with.  Contempt for what they do and what they're trying to say.<p>It's the same story with the next example:<p><i>“As I walk around the Academy,” she writes, “and see so many gifted students interacting with accomplished, dedicated adults” [that means boys and girls talking to teachers] and consider the opportunities for learning that such interpersonal exchanges will yield…” Interpersonal exchanges! Pure garbage. Her letter is meant to assure us alumni that the school is in good hands. I’m not assured.</i><p>She conjures an image and interprets the image.  He would strip out the interpretation and leave only the concrete image of students talking to teachers.  Why?  Her interpretation is a sentimental, idealistic sales pitch.  ""Pure garbage.""  Well, yes, but it's her <i>job</i> to provide a sentimental and idealistic sales pitch.  He has contempt for her writing because he has contempt for her job.<p>Perhaps he could do a better job in these situations, but he obviously isn't interested.  In neither case does he suggest a useful alternative.  Instead, he suggests they should use language that is utterly inadequate for their purpose, and then presumably start looking for a less distasteful profession.<p><i>The words derived from Latin are the enemy—they will strangle and suffocate everything you write....  Those nouns express a vague concept or an abstract idea, not a specific action that we can picture—somebody doing something.</i><p>Pity anyone who needs to communicate concepts and abstract ideas and who isn't free to use fiction or anecdote to do so.  Clearly their writing skills are inferior to such people as<p><i>Joan Didion, who grew up in California and wrote brilliant magazine pieces about its trashy lifestyle in the 1960s. No anthropologist caught it better.</i><p>Should we really declare one approach to a subject ""better"" because it results in punchier prose?  I enjoy simple, readable writing as much as anybody, and outside my own field I read it almost exclusively, but I wouldn't want to live in a world where all the anthropologists, economists, historians, doctors, lawyers, and bureaucrats gave up words such as <i>communication, conversion, reconciliation, enhancement,</i> and <i>verification</i>.  I'd hate to read a shareholder report written in concrete images.  (Perhaps each segment of a pie chart would be labeled with a vivid, engaging anecdote?)<p>All those nasty Latin words have ""infected"" our language because they're useful.  ""Approximation"" cannot be used interchangeably with the nice, robust Anglo-Saxon ""guess.""  (Or ""stab"" -- so much more vivid!)  ""Communicate"" cannot be used interchangeably with ""say,"" since often what is communicated is exactly the opposite of what is said.<p><i>You’ll be interviewing the men and women who are trying to solve those problems—school principals, social workers, health-care workers, hospital officials, criminal justice officials, union officials, church officials, police officers, judges, clerks in city and state agencies—and when you ask them a question, they will answer you in nouns: Latin noun clusters that are the working vocabulary of their field. They’ll talk about “facilitation intervention” and “affordable housing” and “minimum-density zoning,” and you will dutifully copy those phrases down and write a sentence that says: “A major immigrant concern is the affordable housing situation.” But I can’t picture the affordable housing situation. Who exactly are those immigrants? Where do they live? What kind of housing is affordable? To whom? As readers, we want to be able to picture specific people like ourselves, in a specific part of the city, doing things we might also do. We want a sentence that says something like “New Dominican families on Tremont Avenue in the Bronx can’t pay the rent that landlords ask.” I can picture that; we’ve all had trouble paying the landlord.</i><p>Now he's just being lazy.  He laments that people talk using ""the working vocabulary of their field.""  Why shouldn't they?  It's <i>his</i> job as a writer to produce the working vocabulary of <i>his</i> field, which is punchy writing that keeps readers engaged.  Doesn't he realize how frustrated <i>other</i> people must be with his insistence on dealing in nothing but vivid concrete images, not to mention his disdain for people who, because they face different tasks, must resort to different tools?  Does he realize how frustrating it must be to talk to a writer who claims to be interested in the affordable housing situation but has no interest in the concepts and legal tools being used to address it, because they don't fit his professional mindset?<p>And that's why I say he suffers from déformation professionnelle.  He judges everyone's prose as if they wrote for the same reasons he does.  He says he wants to help people write, but he really just wants to make people write to a certain standard, the standard appropriate to one particular kind of writing, regardless of why and for whom they actually write.  If they try to adapt their style to their actual circumstances, they cannot expect any help from him, only contempt.",1263588811

1055852,comment,1054989,1055277,0,0,jhancock,,,"Western IT and Internet companies find themselves being marginalized and having their intellectual property copied.  There exists quite a bit of local innovation in applying tech to China as much applied tech requires different workflow models, so not everything that is copied can be applied directly with success.<p>Many consumer product companies: Coke, P&G, Nike, etc.. have done well.  How their revenue breaks down to sharing with local partners and how much gets back to the international public entity is unknown to me.<p>The article makes some good points, but still tries to label the gov as ""Communist China"".  The author makes a good case for educating Westerners that China isn't what you think it is.  We need more of this kind of talk.  But reusing the old label of ""Communist China"" misses the mark.  I don't know what a better label would be.<p>I agree with much of what you have said.  The deck is stacked against many types of foreign companies.  It is well past time for these entities to start publicly acknowledging this.<p>All that said, I cannot agree with everything the author has said.  His 9 points listed under ""What is the Chinese Economic Model"" are well identified (the bold bullet text itself).  But his rational in each of the associated paragraphs is one-sided.  He seems to fully support Western economic models without acknowledging their flaws and culpability in our engagements with China.  Stolen IP?  Slave labor?  Western government and business knew this full well when we got started and we did it anyway because we reaped short-term value from doing so.  We helped fuel this fire.  We allowed the Yuan to be a fixed/manipulated currency and knew full well why China was doing it and what would happen after they amassed enough wealth.  These ""playbooks"" have always been completely open.  We may not be able to directly influence China, but we can directly influence the Western leaders we elect and the Western companies we buy goods and services from.<p>If you need to understand the mindset of the typical Chinese government official, I will offer this:  Many of them are living a ""good life"" and those that support their governance are living good lives.  They do not want economic growth to collapse and do not see communist-era economic methods as appropriate tools.  They kept the structure of governance but replaced the tools.  But even though the structure of governance has remained very similar, the number and variety of participants has changed considerably.  Unlike most U.S. leaders and citizens, most Chinese have experienced great suffering.  There is support by mainstream Chinese for much of the current heavy handed behavior and as such the government will continue to use such tools they feel are useful in hedging against various forms of collapse.  Its critical to understand much of this is not big gov oppressing its people as the majority of Chinese approve of hedging against extreme failure at most all cost.  Will this approach even out over a reasonable period of time?  Will it avoid more severe outcomes?  I have no idea.  I do know if things get bad enough that it effects the security of Western countries, then its already extremely bad for the Chinese.",1263588354

    refused to allow China’s Chinalco to double its ownership
    interest last year (to 18%), China arrested local CEO
    (and Australian citizen) Stern Hu and three managers,
    who  remain in jail today, under espionage charges.
    China denies any connection. ... In politics, thought,

</code></pre>
No. I'd support the conclusion, but the evidence presentation here is shabby.<p>The event that immediately preceded the Rio executive being arrested was the closing of contract negotiations for a yearly contract on iron ore shipments [1]. The rejected Chinalco acquisition mentioned in the quoted section was only a month before, but evidence for link of causality between that and the arrests is weaker than between the price negotiations and the arrests.<p>Other motivations need to be weighed up as well:<p>* At the time the arrest happened there were internal riots in China's western provinces (causing their leader to abort one of those G meetings and fly back to China). There's nothing like stirring up trouble against foreign devils as a mechanism to distract your people away from internal strife.<p>* The snubbing given to the Australian foreign office also suggests a political aspect. Did the Rudd government imply that it could cause things to happen that it could not deliver? Or did it hamper the process? Or are China just being big-girl's-blouse because they can? [2]<p>In weighing up iron ore issues you need to be aware that China is easily the largest producer [3]. It tends towards bilateral deals on 'strategic' commodities rather than working through global markets like the other major consumers (e.g. oil). This pushes the dynamic of areas affected by those commodities from flexible markets into a zero-sum game.<p>[1] See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Tinto_Group#Arrests_in_China.2C_2009"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Tinto_Group#Arrests_in_Chin...</a><p>[2] ""The Chinese seem determined to continue to humiliate Canberra."", <a href=""http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/beijing-ramps-up-the-humiliation/story-0-1225748894393"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/beijing-ramps-up-the-hu...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Ore"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Ore</a>",1263588019

There are other reasons individual votes may sometimes be ignored (e.g. apparent karma bombing, or voting rings) but if you upvote a randomly chosen comment, it should work.

123015,comment,122855,122855,0,0,ardit33,,,"Rebranding MSFT is like puting lipstick on a pig.  It stil wont change the fact it is a pig.<p>MSFT is overan by bozos, and it will keep staying like that unless they fire half of the people there.  I don't know great developers that want to work for microsoft.  I have met several people that used to work there, and for some reason I have never got along or particulary liked them.  There was something that made me not tick with them.  It is very wierd, but they some kind sense of sutle arrogance and ""empty"" pride.  It is like people that think way too highly of themselves, without showing the real results.<p>Maybe some people try to attach to big companies so they can feel more important or part of the success, even if they don't really contribute much  (there are merely a simple cog, in a thousands of engineers machine).<p>Maybe that's why MSFT is failing to do anything impactful on the web space.",1203929585

123011,comment,122923,122969,0,0,TheTarquin,,,"Agreed.  It's kind of sad that it was trumpeted as being so significant for its (a)religious views.  There was such a message, but it was largely lost in the noise.  So not only was it not a particularly good movie, it wasn't even as controversial, interesting, or important as a lot of people wanted it to be.",1203928893

I mostly grok the system, I think, but I had one comment get viciously hammered.  I thought the comment was fairly innocuous, but perhaps I transgressed some News.YC rule, policy, or etc. that I wasn't aware of?<p>I'd like to play by the rules, I'm just wondering if there's some sore of newb intro that maybe I missed when I signed up?",1203928726

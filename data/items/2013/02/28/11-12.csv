They had me spending part of my time as support and the other part on projects.<p>After about 3 or so months they took me took me out of support and literally placed my desk next to the only full time programmer that company had.<p>They made all changes direct on live servers and I'd already raised this as a concern and now that became my full time job it was agreed that I'd be allowed to create a dev environment.<p>Long story short, I exported the structure of our MySQL database and imported it into dev.  Some variable was wrong so it didn't all import, so I changed the variable, dropped the schema and back to redo.<p>Yeah that was the live database I just dropped.  After a horrible feeling that I can't really explain I fessed up.  I dropped it during lunch so it took about two hours to get a restore.<p>The owner went mad but most other people were sympathetic, telling me their big mistakes and telling me thats what backups were for.<p>The owner was going crazy about losing money or something and the COO pulled me into a room.  I thought I was getting fired but he just asked me what happened and said ""yeah we all make mistakes, thats fair enough, just try not to do it again"".<p>I was then told to get on with it and it must have took me a day to finish what would have taken me an hour but I done it and now we had a process and a simple dev environment.

There only needs to be a _metaphorical_ connection. In essence, we learn how to do things that are necessary through learning metaphors.<p>For example, we don't learn about history in order to know what happened in the past. We learn about history so we can understand how actions have consequences, how to build rational conclusions from evidence, how humanity has (and hasn't) changed over time, and so on. History is a really good metaphor for scientific rigour and process. We don't tend to tell kids that because learning about how some ancient civilisation killed another is less ""boring"" than formal logic.<p>When it comes to learning to code, being taught how to write an application so you might be the next Mark Zuckerberg is ridiculous. The next Mark Zuckerberg is going to learn coding regardless of what they're taught in a classroom. But, that said, would learning the fundamentals of logic, rigour, abstraction, and the application of some bits of maths* be useful for everyone to know? Definitely. I strongly believe we'd have better nurses, plumbers, fighter pilots, street cleaners, and so on in the future if children learn how to make Tetris when they're in school now.<p>* There's so little actual maths in coding these days this is actually a really tenuous thing to say.

I refused them all. It wasn't out of anger. It simply wasn't worth my time. I would need to look at each url requested. Determine if it was spam or if it added value to the site. Then choose whether to delete it or not. Each request would take 5-10 minutes to process. Perhaps I should have started charging.

5298124,comment,5292591,5292591,1,0,mac1175,,,"Wow.   This reminds me of a time in which I used to work for a consulting agency.  It was back in 2003 and I was working on a some database development for one of the company's biggest clients.  One day, I noticed the msdb database had a strange icon telling me it was corrupted.  I went onto MSDN and followed some instructions to fix it and, BAM, the database I was working for months on was gone (I was running SQL Server 2000 locally where this all happened and I was very junior as a SQL developer).  I was silently freaking out knowing this could cost me my job.  I got up from my desk and took a walk. On that walk, I contemplated my resignation.  When I got back from my walk, a thought occurred to me that maybe the database file is still there (I had zero clue at the time that msdb's main purpose was just cataloguing the existing databases among other things).  I did a file search in the MSSQL folders and found a file named with my database's name.  So, that day I learned to attach a database, what msdb's role is, and to make sure to take precautions before making a fix!  However, OP's post shows that this company had no processes in place control levels of access or disaster recovery.  Show the company's faults more than OP's.",1362049728

823597,comment,822354,822661,0,0,barrkel,,,"I think you're going <i>way</i> overboard with your cynicism and criticism of OOP - cynicism bordering on paranoia. I've read your other comment, alleging that OOP ""was pushed by manager types who just wanted as many reports as possible"".<p>The dominant paradigm before OOP was procedural programming, and it had (and has) real problems: tendency towards storing data in globals, lack of a machine-checked mechanisms for subtyping, less discoverable APIs (often a namespacing issue), and difficulty in sharing code when representing abstractions where many kinds of values need to be treated very similarly but with little differences, GUI widgets in particular.<p>OOP is unmistakably a better approach for a large class of problems, primarily because it encodes good procedural practice into well-defined concepts that are checked by the machine, either at compile time, run time, or both.<p>Functional programming has a different kind of benefit: whereas OOP helped modelling values, FP helps modelling algorithms. Because strict FP demands pure functions and immutable data, you can reason about complex functions and expressions knowing that there are no side-effects that can bite you. The benefits of FP over OOP aren't as clear as OOP over procedural programming, as taking the strict approach makes state management problematic and limits freedom in data structure design and ultimately algorithmic complexity, but the benefits are very clear in certain areas.",1253011373

But the GGPs point was I think people reinventing the wheel simply because they are not aware of what was done in the past.<p>> An algorithm you reinvented only to discover a better version later will stick to your head. And it's also fun doing it.<p>That's very true. I played around with clustering for a while, then decided to get serious about it which means downloading and studying all the papers that I can find in open access journals or on websites of the authors. That way you get the best of both worlds, first you gain the experience of doing it yourself and appreciating the problems of that particular domain, then you get to see how others dealt with those problems.",1253009507

823566,comment,822354,823496,0,0,barrkel,,,"I believe you're assuming more things about the programmatic interface of a circle type than is <i>necessarily</i> true. An ellipse with equal major and minor radii <i>is</i> a circle. That much is mathematical fact.<p>Equivalently, a circle is a special kind of ellipse. As an ellipse, you can certainly ask it for major and minor radii. But ""more information"" is an implementation detail. If Circle were a subclass of AbstractEllipse, which itself also had a concrete Ellipse subclass, Circle might implement both major and minor radii ""properties"" in terms of a single field. But again, this is just an implementation detail.<p>All this is only practically useful if there's a reason for considering circles as ellipses, or for specializing behaviour for circles. For example, the circumference calculation for circles is much simpler than for ellipses, so we might want to specialize it. Since our values are immutable, there's no problem in capturing this optimization in the type and overriding the appropriate method.<p>(I'm assuming immutable values throughout, to make it clear.)",1253009342

And it's also fun doing it.<p>Also, a library or a tool you ""reinvent"" is many times better for your needs considering that assembling software pieces is not actually like putting together Lego blocks (although corporates are still trying).<p>Quicksort reinvention is also useful, because that standard qsort you've got laying around there might not behave as you expect (like glib's qsort that uses merge-sort instead) or it might not be optimized for your datasets (because you know, depending on the partitioning function you might end up in the worst-case scenario quite a lot).",1253009303

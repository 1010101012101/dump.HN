6994432,comment,6989257,6993047,1,0,freehunter,,,"Comparing Steam to Windows is invalid to begin with. The only valid comparison is comparing Steam to a similar Microsoft offering. The Windows 8 marketplace and the Windows Phone marketplace are not dissimilar, so my point remains valid. Microsoft cannot remove applications from Windows because they do not control the distribution. They <i>can</i> and <i>have</i> removed apps from their controlled distribution channels which are comparable with Steam (which is what Valve considers their competition). Valve isn&#x27;t worried about Windows 8 desktop, they&#x27;re worried about Windows Marketplace. Your attempted comparison is like saying Netflix has never broken into your house and stolen your DVDs. They can&#x27;t do that because that&#x27;s not a distribution channel they control. They <i>can</i> and <i>have</i> removed movies from their own distribution channel.<p>If you want to argue Windows desktop versus Steam, though, Microsoft does control Windows Defender anti-virus which can force-remove applications or prevent them from running. In that sense, Microsoft surely can deny you access to application you&#x27;ve purchased. Your comparison is still uniquely inappropriate, though.",1388559205

It appears that you can&#x27;t provide answers without first asking questions. When I have questions, I use Google or IRC. Every now and then Google throws up SO questions I can answer (or improve answers to, or point out FAIL in the answers to) on the way to my finding an answer to the original question, and I log in to SO and try to contribute...<p>So my attitude to SO is pretty much &quot;meh&quot;.

2692665,comment,2691188,2692287,4,0,Homunculiheaded,,,"Sure! I'm very much a novice but: I started with 'Visual Guide to Lockpicking' [1] although 'MIT Guide to Lock Picking' [2] is very good and also free.  After you get the basic mechanics of locks and lock-picking down you really just need to practice.  Get yourself a set of lock-picks online (also look at your state laws for lock-picks, in many states only a licensed locksmith can carry them around so it may be a good idea to keep them at home, and avoid doing things like leaving them in your car/pocket. I believe some US states make it out right illegal to possess them, so just be aware).<p>Some places will sell practice locks with pins removed, but do not buy them, they are way overpriced and if you really want to understand the mechanics of locks it will serve you well to bust one open.  So go to a hardware store and pick up an inexpensive but not cheap lock, crack it open and remove some of the pins (even all but one), add/remove/reorder the pins until you are really good, and then buy more locks.<p>Also do keep the law in mind, when I looked it up it's illegal in most if not all states to pick locks that you do not own if you are a not a locksmith (even with the owners permission), which can include obviously the locks on your apartment and locks of friends.  You could probably get away with this, but the hacker interest in learning things like lock-picking is not universally seen as benevolent, and it would be stupid to get in legal trouble for a hobby<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Guide-Lock-Picking-Third/dp/0970978863/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Guide-Lock-Picking-Third/dp/097...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.lysator.liu.se/mit-guide/mit-guide.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lysator.liu.se/mit-guide/mit-guide.html</a>",1308931085

If you're in an industry where the process of invention is extremely costly, patents can often be the only way for smaller entities to participate. Say you have an idea for a new radio technology. It'll cost you millions of dollars to build a prototype (the associated parts and equipment are very expensive). And once you have it --- what do you do with it?

2692477,comment,2687885,2691336,1,0,Silhouette,,,"Our posts are getting very long going point-by-point, so I won't address everything you've said individually now. However...<p>On the efficiency issue, IMHO you're still too focussed on the up-front cost, when it is the long term efficiency that really counts. It doesn't matter if it takes 6 months to develop something properly instead of 3 months to hack it, if the hackers then spend another 6 months patching bugs before anyone can use it.<p>Even if that weren't true, do we really believe that a tri-monthly release cycle is necessary to compete in the browser market today? It takes longer than that for new technologies to be used in production projects, even by the most die-hard of bleeding edge early adopters. Wouldn't you rather code to a well-defined spec and know that it really was going to work in everyone's browser, even if it took another three months for the your favourite new feature to be well-specified so you could use it? We've waited years for things like HTML5 and CSS3, so I think we could wait another few weeks to get them right!<p>Regarding the morale of developers, again, I think you're confusing heavyweight processes generally with my example of Cleanroom in particular. There are plenty of studies that show developers do enjoy working within that process; try a Google Scholar search for Cleanroom Software Engineering and read a few of the papers. Likewise, you also seem to be assuming that Cleanroom is heavy in the sense of being all about writing specs and management overhead, which suggests to me that you've never actually tried it to see what it feels like in practice.<p>This is exactly the sort of preconception and ""I just don't believe it"" reaction I think we need to overcome with evidence if our industry is going to improve its performance. Bizarrely, we seem to be spending far more time today worrying about issues like TDD and pair programming, which have much less proven benefit and get highly variable feedback from those who have used them.<p>I can't help but observe that those ideas are very accessible to a typical journeyman programmer versed in OO languages today, while shifting to something like a Cleanroom process or an Erlang style software architecture or a more declarative programming style as functional programming languages promote requires understanding concepts that for most people are radical and unfamiliar. We fear what we do not understand, and that is holding us back.<p>A final example on this:<p>> Extra specs and documentation might help reduce bugs, but probably not nearly so much as more/better testing.<p>On the contrary, working to good specs with a robust peer review culture is a highly effective quality strategy with an excellent RoI, and more than stands up to any test-based approach I've seen. The evidence for this is overwhelming, if you choose to seek it out. Again, I refer you to Google Scholar, or a good bookshop. But again, you have to be willing to look at a culture shift and trying something with a completely different philosophy to what you do today. You typically won't find this stuff in Cleany McCoder's Internet Echo Blog.<p>> Spending 3 times as long on a given development effort may yield some small quality gains, but the overall effect is a loss of value. A product that has 10% fewer meaningful bugs but has 66% fewer necessary features is a failure.<p>Perhaps, but what if it's more like a 10% overhead to better than halve the number of bugs (as in one small academic comparison I just quickly looked up on Google Scholar)? What if a factor of 2-3x in the up-front development costs really cuts your bug rate from 20 bugs/KLOC not to 18 bugs/KLOC but right down to about 1 bug/KLOC (not unusual for Cleanroom with established teams in industrial practice), with all the resulting savings in maintenance costs later as well as the user-visible improvement in quality?<p>I'm picking Cleanroom in particular here just because I happen to know a little about it, but my point isn't that we should all use Cleanroom. My real point is that there are different processes and design techniques and languages and tools out there, some of them very different to typical industrial practice today, and some of them objectively performing much better.<p>If any software group (I'm not just digging at Firefox, it's an industry-wide problem) wants to complain about maintenance costs and how it's impossible to do much better on quality without silly overheads, I think they should take a look outside the mainstream with an open mind before they make too many bold claims. In the meantime, claims about how it's too hard to both release quickly and maintain basic security patching on other branches (and here I <i>am</i> digging at Firefox's new release strategy) all sound a bit hollow.",1308927868

Their point was it would be more convenient for me if I take an increased salary after the six months instead of equity. They were also very willing to listen to alternative suggestions I might have.
Also I do the think the people are pretty honest. They called up to clarify that it isnt the case that equity is not an option, its just that cash would be more convenient for me.
I do believe that they are good and honest people and if I have implied otherwise in my post, Its a mistake on my part.",1315061722

2957356,comment,2956480,2956480,3,0,mgkimsal,,,"One of the big aspects that often gets overlooked in any discussion about freelancing is the notion of having a cash cushion.  One of the comments on the article stressed that we may be moving towards a new culture of frugality/austerity as a byproduct of more people needing to keep cash reserves to deal with the up/down cycle of freelance income.  It's a transition that took me a bit of time to make personally, but I'm glad I did it.<p>off-topic a bit: What's a little odd to me is how much small/medium businesses rely on credit for payroll.  I've got a friend at a small business, and they have a credit line they use for payroll every 2 weeks, and they've been worried that their credit line would be reduced, meaning they'd have to lay people off.  I've asked around and some other companies do this as well.  Is this practice really widespread, or just the few I spoke with?<p>gentle plug: the indieconf conference for web freelancers can help you adjust to this new industrial revolution :)  <a href=""http://indieconf.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://indieconf.com</a>",1315061668

2957331,comment,2957174,2957328,1,0,CMartucci,,,"Agreed. To say that everything depends on consciousness is somewhat naive. In fact, the things we are ""conscious"" of are not always accurate representations, whatever that may mean. For example:<p>""People commonly misreport their own experiences. We dont even have good insight into how much fun we are having or even whether an experience we are having at a particular moment in time is pleasant or unpleasant. Some examples (among many): being paid a paltry sum to tell another person that the boring and repetitive task in which we have just engaged is fun leads us to think we enjoyed it (Festinger & Carlsmith 1959); observing that we have chosen one item from a range that seems identical leads us to conclude that we have detected differences between them (Nisbett & Wilson 1977). Subjects who experienced arousal caused by an injection of norepinepherine reporting being happy or angry, depending on what cues theyre given (Schachter and Singer 1962), while subjects who exercise prior to encountering an opposite sex confederate of the experimenters rated the confederate more attractive (Allen 1989). We are systematically bad at assessing the causes and the precise character of our experiences. Moreover, there is evidence that our intuitive physics is unreliable. Nave subjects assume, falsely, that an object that is travelling through a curved tube will continue to follow a curved trajectory when it leaves the tube (McCloskey et al. 1980).""

No need to go out of our way to conclude ""omg they're evil stealing our privacy"".<p>Firstly, what if they just don't want to confuse users? I see people confused all the time of when you need to click and when you need to double-click, every time I see someone using the computer  I'm sure I do this myself, too. What does allowing someone to introduce uncertainty as to what's required here do, especially when their click-through buttons look just like Facebook's normal ones on other sites? I'd say it'd just confuse people. I don't have an issue with Facebook doing that, I'd actually <i>rather</i> have them enforce, this, so you <i>know</i> what is going on when you see a standard Like button.<p>(As a few other comments have noted, just replacing the button with a custom-styled one would solve this issue.

About 80 milliseconds in the past<p>This may hold true for sensory perceptions, thoughts etc but not for consciousness. When there are no thoughts, there is absolutely no gap in consciousness. When you live ""consciously"" there is no time-lag.<p>| 6. Consciousness depends on manipulating time. Many cognitive abilities are important for consciousness, and we dont yet have a complete picture.<p>Who is this ""we"". Consciousness does not depend on anything, unless you've incorrectly defined it. Everything else depends on it.<p>| Consciousness wouldnt be possible without the ability to imagine other times<p>Utter tosh. Who has cooked this up ? We've been through this for at least 2-3 millenia.

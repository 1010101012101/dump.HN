6175943,comment,6174514,6175064,8,0,iyulaev,,,"I suspect it&#x27;s a combination of support, documentation, and trade secrets. I&#x27;ve worked with numerous vendors over the last decade and the support strategies vary dramatically. Some vendors put up very nice datasheets, manuals, source code, etc, while some give you almost nothing at all, and instead ship an engineer with the product to help you design it in. The rationale is that these chips are very complicated, applications vary dramatically, and it&#x27;s sometimes better to increase the quantity of manpower (in engineer form) for your favorite 5 customers (that make up most of your market anyway) rather than to increase the quantity of documentation so that you can also sell to Joe & Jane Hobbyist.",1375912783

6175929,comment,6173358,6174114,1,0,solistice,,,"I personally think this thing will be misused to the hilt, but there are ways they can add real value to a brick and mortar shopping experience.<p>Imagine you walked into a larger store, for example Walmart. As you walk in, the estimote app loads the wallmart app temporarily over the instore wifi. The app shows you a map of the store, which shows what products can be bought in which aisle, making your shopping experience much faster. As you approach the cash register, it acts like a concierge and tells you which register is the fastest one (some airports do this with a dedicated person, which directs people to different lines. It yields considerable speed ups). As you leave the store, the walmart app is removed from your phone. Estimote now shows you the nearest estimote enabled stores.<p>That&#x27;s the good scenario. Now to the bad.<p>You go to the mall. As you approach it, you phone starts buzzing like it&#x27;s mad. You think it&#x27;s a call, so you pick up your phone. Nope, its Footlocker trying to sell you their new line of shoes at a 10% discount. Fine, but you&#x27;re not looking for shoes. As you walk through the mall, your phone goes of wantonly, displaying ads for stores that are on the other side of the mall. Obviously, they don&#x27;t know how to configure their estimotes. You can&#x27;t walk for 5 meters without an estimote alert going off, logging itself to your allready estimote infested task list. Completely pissed off, you turn off your phone in order to leave the mall at peace. You&#x27;re not buying stuff here. As you get home, you get an important call, but your phone is off, and you miss it. Resignated, you trash your iphone and get yourself a single purpose nokia. Serves you right estimote, serves your right.<p>I think there&#x27;s certainly potential behind these, but their &quot;sell the dev packs&quot; approach to it doesn&#x27;t seem to be very promising. Most small retailers will struggle with the setup and SDK. Hell, the local supermarkets cash registers here have SQL injection vunerabilities. One bar code that includes ;DROP TABLE * in it and they&#x27;re closed for a week.<p>There seem to be several steps in setting these up. 
  1. Buying them.
  2. Setting them up physically. 
  3. ? Linking them to a central system ? 
  4. Writing an app.<p>Out of these points, it seems they are only covering 1, even though there&#x27;s certainly work involved (and money to be made) in steps 2 - 4 . Dumping these on the buyer leads to friction in the buying process which will cost them sales.  They need to sort that out.",1375912607

6175923,comment,6174245,6175821,11,0,josh2600,,,"A quick note on how the conference calling industry actually works...<p>1) Most BIG conference calling companies are registered as competitive local exchange carriers.<p>2) As CLECs, these companies get to charge for inbound traffic.<p>3) Charge customers per minute in addition for insane profit.<p>Companies like FreeConferenceCall.com are basically ignoring the subscriber revenue in exchange for only the inbound tariff (that&#x27;s their industry disruption).<p>Example: I setup a conference call bridge on FreeConferenceCall.com and I call in. One other person joins me. I call in on my cellphone and so does the other person. Neither one of us pays for long distance so we don&#x27;t care, but on the backend, FreeConferenceCall.com is billing our cell providers $.30 per minute.<p>That&#x27;s the reason GoogleVoice blocks those numbers, because Google is already eating $.004/min for US numbers, they can&#x27;t afford to eat calls that cost $.30/min; that&#x27;s nuts.<p>This is the same business model that powers MagicJack as well. Just a quick FYI. Paying people for inbound minutes is only for folks that don&#x27;t have enough volume to get a CLEC-level agreement (you can get CLECs to sell you inbound for $0 or even to pay you for the traffic if you have enough volume). The beauty of Twilio&#x27;s business model is that they get all of the aggregation benefits of your traffic.<p>Does that help?<p>Edit: Also the comment I&#x27;m replying to has a ton of great advice!",1375912597

And long before you could reason about these things you got hungry, ate, and got full, and it hasn&#x27;t hurt you to do so and you continued on your path.<p>The current things you &quot;trust your health&quot; to have, especially if you buy any packaged food, been engineered in ways that are way more extreme than what has happened to Soylent in order to make you buy more of them. The book &quot;In Defense of Food&quot; [1] by Michael Pollan goes into great detail about the things folks do which make Rob sound pretty mild.<p>You state <i>&quot;As far as I&#x27;ve seen, our understanding of diet and human metabolism is in the dark ages.&quot;</i> Which is an understandable bit of hyperbole but the reality is that you trust in the defensive mechanisms of your body which have evolved over millennia to get as much as they can out of what ever you put into your digestive system, whether it be Beluga caviare or rice beetles.<p>If you look at the situation non-emotionally (and that is very hard to do), then you see that based on your belief that we&#x27;re in the dark ages of nutrition science, and the chemicals in choice A and choice B are the same. The predicted outcome of consuming all of A or B as your primary food source is &quot;no difference.&quot; However, as most people I know who have gone through this emotional journey, what <i>does</i> change is you start actually being aware of what you are eating and making choices based on that and it does have an outcome since <i>you change</i> behavior when you identify a correlation between eating X and outcome Y.<p>[1] <a href=""http://michaelpollan.com/books/in-defense-of-food/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelpollan.com/books/in-defense-of-food/</a>",1375912491

Most of our MREs were expired (they expire quickly in 100+ degree heat) so we ate a lot of Iraqi food.  I also brought tubs of True-Mass to mix with water.  It worked pretty well, even over 1-2 weeks ops.<p>From this experience, I&#x27;ve always been interested to see how soylent turns out.  Even back here in the rear nutrition is a chore.  I eat to stay alive, not for the experience.  Heck, I go to Costco and pay $3.77 for a slice of pizza, hotdog, and a drink whenever I can.<p>My major question about soylent is its nutritional value.  I work out 2x a day, 5-6 days a week.  I have a Syntha-6 protein shake after each workout with some fruit and orange juice.  I&#x27;m curious if soylent will provide the same level of nutrition I currently get.<p>If it does, it&#x27;d be excellent under demanding physical conditions like combat operations and high performance athletes.  I&#x27;d eventually like to see different mixes, i.e.: weight loss, weight-gain, distance athlete, etc.  Hell, I&#x27;d pay a premium for it.  My wife pays around $200/wk. for Bistro M.D. meals because she doesn&#x27;t have time to cook.

Like friends - if they understand, they will engage and support you, give advices; if not, they will change the subject, think you&#x27;re a little lost and tell you to &quot;get a job&quot;. Or to your parents - if they understand, they will be happy and optimistic about your future; if not, they will worry and tell you to, guess, &quot;get a job&quot;. To other entrepreneurs and developers - if they understand, they will try to give advices, make contacts, keep you in their mental list of people they would like to work; if not, they will you consider one wantrepreneur.
This pitch is very important, it needs to come out without any thinking, on automatic. You need only one answer on this pitch, two or three sentences and a complement if the interlocutor is interested and give you space to talk about your startup. More than that is a conversation, and for conversations you do not need pitches.<p>Do you know for whom you do not need a pitch? Investors. I am not talking about potential investors, who may one day remember you and consider the investment as the entrepreneurs I said earlier. I am speaking of that meeting with the investor, face to face, where you&#x27;re to present your startup and they will decide whether to invest in you or not. A meeting is a conversation, not a pitch. It is the time that you will present what you know, not what you memorized. We must listen to the investor, to understand his doubts, it takes a lot of empathy. When going to a meeting for such a conversation you should prepare your knowledge, not your speech. You must have a deep understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of your startup, you have to create a presentation only to show some specific numbers that you have no reason to decorate. Those data that are calculated in a serious, rigorous method and not &quot;estimated&quot; or &quot;expected&quot;.<p>In summary, I think two things are essential: i) to have a carefully prepared pitch, ready to go out without thinking, the standard answer about your startup - something that is clear and visionary at the same time, to show the idea and attract person&#x27;s interest and ii) not to have anything memorized if this short answer turn into a conversation, but you have to be completely updated to all relevante knowledge about your business - and this will tell not only the investors, but yourself, if you are prepared to run this business.",1375911016

It&#x27;s great that people are buying them so we can climb the adopter curve, but until they are competitively priced it&#x27;s just not worth it. Ironically, for those wealthy short commute early adopters the savings over the next couple years are very small. Cars save money on short commutes, but savings also proportional to commute length, therefore savings are low, but price is much higher.

I love ours, and would buy another one, except that every aspect of the buying experience has put me off ever buying another Nissan ever again. I&#x27;ll repeat: I&#x27;ll never buy another Nissan.<p>Pre-ordering one was easy enough. After that, the experience went downhill. There were some production delays due to the tsunami, but they were going to have delays anyway, tsunami or not. I&#x27;ll let that slide, it&#x27;s a radically different car, things didn&#x27;t go as planned; whatever. Finally the cars are being delivered. Months go by, and despite having pre-ordered on the first day, no Leaf in my driveway. Then I find out via online forums that people who ordered months after I did are picking up their car. That&#x27;s completely unacceptable, but whatever, it&#x27;s just a car.<p>Eighteen months after I entered the initial pre-order, the car arrives and we&#x27;re off to the dealership. That was probably the final straw for any future Nissan purchases. Despite having arranged a time to pick it up, and having waited eighteen months for the car, we shake hands with the salesman and...wait. After nearly an hour of standing around the dealership drooling over the GT, we are finally deemed worthy of the privilege of receiving the car. After the usual BS with the finance guy, we drive off.<p>I&#x27;ll reiterate that the car itself is great. It exceeded expectations, and after two years and 16K miles we&#x27;ve had zero trouble with it. But I&#x27;m not going to purchase another car from a company that fails at every step to delivery.",1375910924

I agree you should have nice, fat margins.  Remember, you should be setting pricing based on how much your customers are willing to pay, not how much it costs you.  For that reason, I think you should segment your plans based on max number of participants, even though this probably costs you nothing.  I would think that this would be the best way to segment out customers willing to pay more: if I&#x27;m a small business or a freelancer, I&#x27;m not going to have many people on my conference calls, but if I&#x27;m a larger business with deeper pocketbooks, I&#x27;m going to have large conference calls and thus be driven to the more expensive plans.

Usually most vendors think that their &#x27;solutions&#x27;, details about their hardware designs exposed in the drivers and optimizations are extremely valuable.  Personally in my experience I found that most of what vendors considered secret was well known and not that novel and the majority of what was being done was application of the same or similar techniques in their hardware and drivers.  Sure there are some novel things, but enough people have moved between the graphics card companies that the drivers really have very little truly unique information about the designs that would help a competitor.<p>One thing that I think does cause problems for opening up hardware though is that many graphics implementations use the same or similar chips (to save on asic costs) and the drivers enable options based on the product the customer bought, but the underlying chip will actually still implement the higher end functionality.  This is a common enough technique and to avoid people getting 500 dollar parts for 99 they can&#x27;t open up the drivers.

It can sometimes make sense to sell yourself when you&#x27;re small for a few million, rather than take more funding and roll the dice again. Google likes to do early-stage acquisitions, and we expect them to become increasingly common as other companies learn what Google has.<p>If you take a large amount of money from an investor, you usually give up this option. But we realize (having been there) that an early offer from an acquirer can be very tempting for a group of young hackers. So if you want to sell early, that&#x27;s ok. We&#x27;d make more if you went for an IPO, but we&#x27;re not going to force anyone to do anything they don&#x27;t want to.</i><p>I think YC prefers big successes but doesn&#x27;t try to pressure everyone to be the next Dropbox or AirBnB",1375910016

6175605,comment,6168612,6172123,1,0,Nav_Panel,,,"Huh, I remember hearing a similar story but I too can&#x27;t place the name. I bet he was a Chicago guy... maybe Muddy Waters?<p>Johnson and Beiderbecke are both good name from their respective periods (30s country blues and 20s jazz), but I&#x27;d argue that there were significantly more influential musicians on the development of the blues style throughout the 40s and 50s. More on that in a minute... Robert Johnson&#x27;s an interesting guy.<p>Johnson&#x27;s influence is a weird case: he was almost totally unknown until the early 1960s, when that classic compilation (King of the Delta Blues Singers, on Columbia, 1961) came out with many of his recordings. As a result, his influence really begins to widen in the 1960s, as many white blues-rock bands were starting to form and gain popularity (such as The Rolling Stones, The Yardbirds (featuring Eric Clapton), and Mike Bloomfield + Bob Dylan). This blues-rock was the stuff that really made an impact on American society at large, and as a result, we tend to consider Robert Johnson to be one of the seminal blues artists. Odd how that turns out.<p>Anyway, back to seminal blues artists. Lonnie Johnson and Blind Lemon Jefferson (see: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3yd-c91ww8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3yd-c91ww8</a>) were the two who I&#x27;d argue contributed most to the &quot;classic&quot; style. Johnson was exceptionally prolific and exceptionally good, and Blind Lemon mentored many young artists, including Robert Johnson and T-Bone Walker. On the white side of things, Eddie Lang (see: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Loc8WiDvNaE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Loc8WiDvNaE</a>) was arguably the first jazz guitarist (and had a heavy influence on many blues musicians), and Jimmie Rodgers (yay, awesome video footage! <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIlURYJI-xs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIlURYJI-xs</a>) was arguably the first guitar-playing &quot;modern&quot; country musician (he fused country and blues). He too had a wide influence on blues artists, going so far as to collaborate with Louis Armstrong (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BFbY9Vw8DM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BFbY9Vw8DM</a>), and to be the reason why Howlin&#x27; Wolf started &quot;howling.&quot;<p>Thanks for playing :)",1375909330

6175591,comment,6174245,6175564,2,0,rexreed,,,"Unfortunately, for these sorts of SaaS businesses, the income is rarely passive in nature. Startup companies, which form part of the basis for the market for this app, have a naturally high churn rate. This means that you need to acquire customers continuously just to keep up with churn, and higher yet to achieve growth.<p>These needs for high acquisition rate drives up high customer acquisition costs, which eats at the margins. $5k in revenues is good, but the profits are not mentioned. Going from $5k to $50k will not scale margins linearly. Indeed, the need to multiply customers by 10 will necessarily increase customer acquisition costs (low hanging fruit will no longer be available) and increase overall churn (the &quot;natural&quot; churn rate applies).<p>If you wanted to make money in consulting, it certainly would be easier to just offer consulting services, and both margins and sustainable revenues would be higher. Perhaps you can use your SaaS app as a consulting marketing tool, but I don&#x27;t see this app being used that way.",1375909217

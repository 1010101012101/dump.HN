This caused problems when carbon fiber started to be used to build large airplanes. Those parts don&#x27;t bend and retained the internal stresses caused by mismatches. I read this happened to Boeing.<p>Glass and ceramics are harder than steel. The reason that glass is fragile, is that one can use its own strength against itself.

Like you, we&#x27;d be disappointed and surprised if our users viewed CleverPet as a substitute for real interaction. Our concern is for the times during the day when a dog would like to have something to do, but doesn&#x27;t. When we&#x27;ve spoken with other dog owners, it&#x27;s not that they don&#x27;t want to engage with their pet, it&#x27;s that they can&#x27;t. Very few people with dogs can afford to spend eight hours a day directly engaging with their pet, and until now, that has just meant lots of bored dogs.

Create your own &quot;ad network&quot;.<p>Basically, figure out the theme of your blog and what kind of people it attracts and then find affiliate programs for that.<p>For example. Let&#x27;s say your tutorials are for developers. What do developers need?<p>* development tools\n* hosting\n* further courses/learning<p>That will yield a pretty good list of affiliates that will convert well such as:<p>* New Relic\n* Digital Ocean\n* TeamTreeHouse<p>(respectively). You&#x27;ll make much more cash, and it&#x27;ll work better for your site. [Checkout my site](<a href=""http://antjanus.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://antjanus.com/</a>) for instance. I have a TeamTreeHouse ad (affiliate) which makes me a solid $X every month. The adsense ad underneath makes about $X/100 (it was slightly better when it was at the top of the sidebar but still made only a fraction of what the TTH ad made). I also have an ad for Bootstrap themes on my Bootstrap tutorials. That ad makes about $X/2 BUT my teamtreehouse ad performed at $X/25 for those articles, makes sense?<p>Anyways, I&#x27;m getting rid of adsense in favor of my own &quot;ad network&quot;.<p><i></i>EDIT<i></i> A good example of other people doing this is [TechPro](<a href=""http://tech.pro"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tech.pro</a>) (I worked there briefly during the first sprint to make a pre-alpha whatever) which has its own ad serving network and directly serves affiliate programs.",1398876144

Integrated and end to end tests are much, much more important than unit tests.  They actually test the application, not a contrived, isolated,  scenario.<p>Much of the testing activity and literature of late has been complaining how brittle end-to-end tests are, because all the focus is on pure unit tests.  This leads to defect pile-up at release time or at the end of an iteration.   Whereas the smoother teams I&#x27;ve worked with did end-to-end and integration tests all the time.  Unit tests existed too, but only when there was sufficiently complex logic or algorithms to warrant such a test, or if we used TDD to flesh out interfaces or interactions for a feature.<p>Many web applications don&#x27;t have a lot of logic, they have a lot of database transactions with complex variations for updates or queries.  So, <i>especially</i> if you have an ORM, which are notoriously fiddly ... it makes sense to have the majority of tests (TDD or not) hit the database, since the code will only ever be executed WITH a database.<p>Mocking or decoupling the database can introduce wasteful assumptions and complexities that aren&#x27;t needed in your code base. The only time it makes sense to decouple the database is if expect you&#x27;ll need polyglot persistence down the road and your chosen persistence framework won&#x27;t help you.<p>I have worked with developers that prefer test cases run in under 1 second on every save.   To me it helps to have a set of unit tests that are in-memory and very fast, that cover basic sanity checks like model integrity, input validation and any in-memory algorithms.  But the bulk of tests really need to test your code <i>as it will be used</i>, which often involves database queries.   At worse, use an in-memory database that can load test data and execute tests in a couple of seconds.",1398876076

It takes time, effort, and increases your code&#x27;s complexity to add that abstraction. The idea is that that investment will pay off later if you do end up making significant changes there. If you don&#x27;t, though, you end up in the whole.<p>From that perspective, trying to abstract your application away from your <i>application framework</i> seems like a wasted effort to me. It&#x27;s <i>very</i> unlikely you&#x27;ll be swapping out a different framework, and, even if you do, it&#x27;s a virtual guarantee that will require massive work in your application too.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s scary to be coupled to a third-party framework.

Not 3 pounds, not lima beans, not canned, 2 pounds dried navy beans per week.  Ditto cheeses and rice and specific canned fruit juice for vitamin C.  My point with this anecdote is coordination with that program might help guide further recipes in the book, assuming it hasn&#x27;t already been done to maximal ability.  Perhaps similar coordination with food banks to match whats typically donated with recipe ingredient lists.<p>A non-coincidental observation I can make is the cookbook is highly non-paleo and that correlates with poor people who aren&#x27;t literally starving tend toward obesity.  So a bit more salad and a bit less bread products might be a healthy idea.  A stir fry never killed anyone and they don&#x27;t cost much of anything unless you put fancy stuff in.

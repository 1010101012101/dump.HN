Maybe they had a different internal timeline (end of aug) vs. an external timeline.<p>If they were like practically everyone else in this wacky industry, they would be late for the internal timeline but not worry about it because the external timeline is the one that matters. Thus, there would be very little pressure to meet the internal timeline and a lot of pressure to meet the external timeline. Worse, they would wind up being late for the external timeline as well as the internal timeline.<p>For example, if someone wanted to add a feature to Snow Leopard, the dev team might  say ""we can't make our internal schedule if we add this."" But some product manager would say ""well, will you still make the external schedule?"" and bang they would start to slip.<p>If they had an internal schedule and managed to stick to it I believe they are an exception to how software is usually developed.",1251147112

If you're unaware of search axes, you have to click, ""Show search options,"" which is in an <i>extremely</i> tiny font, next to a button that very notably says ""Search the Web""--<i>not</i> search my inbox.  Furthermore, once you actually discover that, and use it, <i>you still don't know about the axes, because that search box doesn't use them</i>.  The only place where you can discover search axes is by clicking on a label, which results in ""label:foo"" being shown in the search box--but that's actually a lie, because the output if you dump that into the search field, versus if you click on a label name, don't match if you have more than about 30 messages in that label.  Go try it.<p>So, yeah.  Axes are great.  And they're completely unintuitive and impossible to discover in Gmail unless you read the help, which no user ever does.  So you've done a great job finding a part of Gmail's search interface that's at least as broken as the underlying implementation.",1251146076

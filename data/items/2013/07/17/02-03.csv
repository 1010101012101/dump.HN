The issue here is the &quot;/e&quot; modifier in PHP can be injected in to a context where the programmer didn&#x27;t expect it. The preg_replace function should take the eval modifier as a flag parameter.<p>Perl <i>does</i> have a ?{} eval expression, but it has to be enabled with an extra &#x27;use&#x27; directive. The documentation also suggests enabling taint checking or &quot;constrained evaluation within a Safe compartment&quot;.<p>Contrast this to PHP, where /e appears to be on by default and there&#x27;s no mention of it whatsoever in the documentation, except in the change log to say it&#x27;s deprecated in 5.5.<p>Also PCRE, which PHP uses, is a C library... so I doubt it has any eval functionality.

In a DFA-based regexp implementation (which, admittedly, V8 doesn&#x27;t use) matching is guaranteed O(n), where n is the number of characters you look at before finding a match or deciding that the match has failed. There are DFA-based lexer generators, like GNU flex, which take regular expressions for your tokens, turn it into a big DFA, and spit out a linear-time lexer. This is the same asymptotic time as the hand-rolled parser.<p>The regexp-based version linked to in the article, on the other hand, has a list of regular expressions which are sequentially tried against the input to grab each token. For this particular lexer, a failed match will fail on the first character, i.e. in constant time. So this is asymptotically O(n*k) where n is the input length and k is the (small, constant) number of tokens.<p>Finally, most regular expression engines are not DFA-based; they use a backtracking algorithm which is, theoretically, exponential-time. However, with the particular regular expressions used here, successful matching will be O(n) for each one, and failed matching O(1).",1374028207

FundersClub may operate liquidity services for private companies, including employee liquidity program management for private companies, and eventually a trading platform for private companies that wish to provide ongoing private market liquidity to their shareholders. We may also participate in the investment funds, which can achieve returns for us along with other investors. We will continue to assess the opportunities within regulatory and legal guidelines, and are not providing any of those services currently.</i><p>[1] - <a href=""https://fundersclub.com/site/faq/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fundersclub.com/site/faq/</a>",1374027059

If a Microsoft employee surreptitiously &quot;captured&quot; user data when asked by the NSA, he would be guilty of multiple federal felonies and subject to significant civil liability. I suppose if this were a movie, the president would secretly pardon him, or he&#x27;d get a new identity under the witness protection program or something, but, alas, this is not fiction.<p>Microsoft&#x27;s deputy general counsel and VP John Frank has a top secret security clearance.

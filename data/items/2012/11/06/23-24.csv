4751504,comment,4748624,4748624,3,0,nashequilibrium,,,"Pls do not follow the advice of the OP. I started a hedgefund in 2004 doing HF platform arbitrage and ran it for 5yrs and i can honestly tell you that this is just survivorship bias. This is a very complex field and being off slightly, having a slight bias, a fraction of a point off your execution pricing and a slightly flawed money management system is recipe for disaster.<p>The biggest issue is the confusion that you can apply machine learning to HF trading. HF trading sub 15min mark is more about playing the deal flow, and only the institutions have an edge on this. This is why goldman had to separate the buy and sell sides in the early 2000's. Above 15mins you are able to find an edge using time series analyses since the market is scaling invariant according to Benoit Mandelbrot and this does not apply to dealflow. Also having access to dealflow allows you to predict volatilty seconds ahead which allows you decrease your risk and increase you reward as well as handle your costs since the volatility will impact your transaction costs even if transaction costs themselves stay the same. There is just so much stuff to cover that a comment will not do justice in explaining what is wrong with this guys logic.",1352246284

4751450,comment,4749574,4750727,5,0,arrrg,,,"Huh?<p>I dont get US voting. Why dont you do it on a Sunday, like much of Europe? 12 hours, fine, but on a day when most people have to work. When you add in commute times and all that there has to be little time for many people to vote and you basically have to plan your day around it. If voting is on a Sunday you might even spontaneously decide to take a lazy Sunday stroll to the voting booth. (But then again, you have to register beforehand in many states, which also seems pretty crazy to me.)<p>Add the long lines (Seriously, whats even going on with that? Germany has a much higher voter turnout than the US  74% vs 49% during the last federal election  and I have never seen any lines. The most I ever had to wait were two or three minutes, and I also havent ever seen media reports about long lines.<p>It seems to me that trying to make voting easier is very much the right thing to do in the US while making it harder is not.<p>However, I do not believe in any grand or small conspiracy theories and I dont think there is any kind of large scale manipulation going on. It just all seems dysfunctional, not manipulated. When comparing it to German elections, why does it seem that politicians have so much control over it? They dont seem to be shy to make politics with how voting is implemented  which is a total taboo in Germany, no politician would ever dare to give off the impression that they are trying to change how the election is run in order to favor their party. Much of the organization is handed off to independent experts who take most of the decisions.<p>Its not that hard. There are many Europeans countries where voting is just not a big deal and where there are never big issues like in the US. You are the oldest democracy in the World, shouldnt you have figured out that stuff by now?<p><p> There is one recent exception to this. The federal voting law was declared unconstitutional two times in a row from the constitutional court during the last years.<p>The way federal elections work is that its basically proportional representation  i.e. people vote for parties, any party with more than five percent gets the percentage of seats they won  but there are also direct candidates in every district, insuring that everyone has her or his candidate they can write to. Those direct candidates are elected using first past the post, but they are at least supposed to be inconsequential to the percentage of seats a party gets. If there arent enough direct candidates to fill the seats a party got, those seats are filled from a per-state party list of candidates.<p>However, what happens when a party has more direct candidates than they have seats? Before the constitutional court struck that down those overhang mandates were just added without changing anything else, basically skewing with the percentages. A party which got 50 seats might suddenly get 60 seats without other parties (without overhang mandates) also getting more seats.<p>In the last election this has favored conservatives, but taking this to the constitutional court was successful. The court gave the parliament time to change the law. What was unique and unprecedented, however (and a rare case of German politicians making politics with how voting works) was that the current conservative government decided unilaterally on a solution  instead of by working together, as had been tradition. However, that solution was also struck down (with constitutional judges showing pretty open dismay that the parliament was seemingly unable to solve this problem in the long time allotet and worried about the fact that an election is coming up in 2013)  leading the conservative government to this time around try and find a consensus solution. So it all was back to the tradition of not just changing election laws unilaterally without at least talking to the biggest opposition party and trying to find a solution both can agree on.<p>What will happen now is that parties without overhang mandates will get more seats to balance those overhang mandates of other parties, thus not skewing the percentages. Im personally still not a fan of this solution  the parliament is already to big and now it will grow further  but it should be constitutional.",1352245370

Fundamentally there is a buffer between the electorate and the actual election (it's called the electoral college.)   Then fundamentally, most issues are never voted on by the electorate and because of that, it kind of rare that they are voted on at all.   Every election ""abortion"" comes up but when is the last time the US senate has actually voted on it?<p>There are things to make it more 'efficient' but again, the slowness with which things happen is kind of a feature, they tend to stick better when they do happen.  Look back, we didn't re-enslave people.  We did have the prohibition but overall the constitution hasn't been retouched that much.<p>There are also sets of fundamentally unsafe issues: abortion,  maybe birth control (oddly, I thought that one was sort of settled but there are a vocal minority that seem to be offended by its very concept) and anything that cuts entitlements.  Short of a booming growing economy, I think it might be safe to say the US budget won't be ""balanced"" until the baby-boomers die off as it just might not be a realistic goal, never mind the debt.  You can't touch those unsafe issues without taking huge political risk<p>Don't get me wrong, if those issue affect you personally it sure does suck, but the design is for slow change.  The dichotomies it presses, such as if you are against abortion, by proxy you are also don't accept climate change, among other things.

I can play up and down the circle of fifths/fourths and improvise endlessly over the harmonized major/minor scale playing right through the changes.  None of that knowledge helps decipher the purpose or meaning of the instructions you gave.<p>I'll try and walk through it.<p>> If ""major"" then switch to the relative minor, or vice versa.<p>OK, home chord is Em, so we'll use G major.<p>> Go Round the circle of fifths or the circLe of fourths either direction, but stay on whichever side of ""major/minor.""<p>OK, that's C or D given G as the starting point.<p>> Go up or down the scale, staying on whichever side of ""major/minor.""<p>So playing the G, C, or D scale over an E minor progression.  G makes sense, same scale as Em; C or D... don't even parse for me.  I don't think of chords and scales as separate, changing the scale changes the underlying chords I'd play under them, thus changing the key to something other than Em.<p>> So for example, a tune set with E minor, G major, A major should work.<p>What?  Nothing you just said would lead me to think A major would work over an Em progression.  G major, sure, obvious, it's the relative major of Em and just another name for G major scale, but A... why A, you haven't explained that above, your example doesn't match what the instructions seem to say.",1353945543

4832458,comment,4828399,4829258,1,0,bpatrianakos,,,"I think some of those aren't bad. It seems like a few of those points are things that you maybe had a hard time coping with or know someone who has and so now you're saying this is a negative consequence of schooling.<p>Learning to self-censor is a good thing. It doesn't mean you stop thinking independently, it just means you learn what's appropriate to say to whom, and how, and when, and where, etc. This isn't necessarily a bad thing and is an important part of developing as a person. We can't go around saying ""hi, I think you're fat"" when we meet someone overweight and then applaud it because self-censorship is bad. Kinda lame example but you know what I mean.<p>Trying to be normal and fit in is also an important part of growing up. Because I don't know any better, this point makes it sound like you're promoting non-conformity for the sake of non-conformity. You can be normal and still be unique. We live in the real world and learning how to choose groups to be accepted by and subsequently fitting in with them is an essential skill all humans need to learn. I personally am lacking in that skill so I have lots of awkward social interactions at work and other places. It's not a good thing and I wish I did learn to be normal. I can still be myself when its appropriate but sometimes you there's nothing wrong with just fitting in.<p>Learning how to handle teasing (regardless of whether you are being teased or doing the teasing) is, once again, an important part of developing as a person.<p>These three points you list are not negatives of schooling at all and they are just as prevalent outside of an educational environment as they are within one. Furthermore, being exposed to these things and subsequently learning how to cope with them makes you a more well rounded person. People who don't go through these experiences and don't develop these social skills will have a harder time out in the real world than those who have. It's my personal belief that people who tend to spend lots of time online (particularly the stereotypical nerd gamers and coders) have a hard time socially partially because they have avoided situations where they would have to learn to self-censor, be teased, tease someone else, trying to fit it. There are other factors but learning how to get through these challenges would probably help them a bit.<p>Now, you do make some good point about second-rate materials. The belief that exams measure knowledge is also highly debatable and probably false too, I'll grant you that. That said, the rest of your points sound more like a rejection of authority than anything that's detrimental to people. There's nothing wrong to deferring to authority. We live in a civilized society and there's a structure to it. The key is learning when its justified to stand up to authority. I can see you're coming from a sincere place but I just can't get behind you on this. It seems more like you're ant-authority for the sake of being anti-authority and nothing more.",1353945470

4832456,comment,4832098,4832098,2,0,rickdale,,,"Expecting and planning for failure is definitely a good system to use for losing weight and exercise. Tim Ferris's famous slow carb diet (which has me down 50lbs this year) is based on one day a week breaking the habit and allowing yourself to not feel guilty about it. That was a big factor for me being consistent on the diet plan. I knew if I eat bad today, guilt, but if I eat bad in 3 days, pleasure.<p>Exercise is a great habit building tool because when you start off, you can really only get better. 30 minutes working out can turn into an hour can turn into 2 hours. And you start to enjoy it more as you go along and learn new things.<p>Reading is also a good habit to build on. I had an english teacher in high school that would assign 5-10 pages of reading every night. It made the class discussions meaningful because instead of expecting people to be in the habit of reading 50 pages of a book/night he knew he had to build the habit to read. The rest of my teachers expected us to be readers, and didn't focus at all on the habit building side of it.",1353945447

Back to the subject, Ruby's OO is much closer to Smalltalk's vision. Method dispatching in Java is essentially dereferencing a function pointer (found by traversing a class hierarchy) and adding a hidden argument (self.) In Ruby, you can override an object's method dispatching mechanism to be whatever you want it to be (although the default behavior is very similar to Java's.) This makes it a lot harder to optimize, (your JIT compiler can't simply inline those calls) but it opens all kinds of interesting meta-programming possibilities.",1353944645

Let us assume that for now we have been collecting user data and recommending them random movies. The first thing we do is to go through this data and try to figure out what would be relevant user features. While you are at it, you might find that there are some odd issues with the way data is being collected which is creating statistical biases: Say for example, you only have server time when the user rating of the movie hit your system and not the actual time at which the user rated the movie. So you go back and fix those. Repeat, rinse and redo.  Now, you go out and find out that your potential feature set is extremely sparse and high dimensional. So you think about adding other features from the Movie set. Go through those: Hopefully you are not starting the problem from scratch and you already have gone past the data collection and feature extraction problem when it comes to movies. Now, you start thinking algorithmically, nothing too complicated because everything has to be made production ready and adding bugs in machine learning algorithms is extremely easy (See Mahout ;-)). You prototype a few algorithms in Hive or your favorite scripting language and then get some data out for A/B testing. You run your A/B tests and hopefully you have something that looks significantly better than baseline. Now you go through the boring part of making that algorithm production ready: This means thinking in terms of scale: 1) How do I deliver these recommendations on the fly to millions of users who are using my fancy new media device. 2) How do I do this while not stressing out my system. So you write a bunch of code, integrate into your current APIs, run a cron and hope nothing breaks and monitor graphs like a nervous little rabbit.<p>Then, you repeat this and do all this over next week.<p>EDIT: Obviously depending on the company and the job, this entire story might completely change etc etc.",1353944530

Going back to school doesn't really solve the problem of spouse being attached to the main visa holder (AFAIK education in US can be quite expensive).<p>OK. Let me put it across in a different way then: Why should a person with no or little experience be allowed to take a job which could potentially be used by someone who is a citizen?<p>> What I dislike the most about H1B visa is that it is almost the only way to start working in the US which as you said aimed to temporarily fill a need for highly skilled labor. So what are the alternatives? I would be totally OK with H1B if it was limited to say 2 years with absolutely no possibility to extend it, people would not be lured to the USA with false promises of future improvement of their conditions. Last time I checked it was possible to lose H1B simply because of quota no matter how many years you've spend in the US, it's wrong.<p>So is your issue the time limitation itself or that time for which one can be on an H1B is two years rather than five years.<p>> I would like to compare it to Swiss B permit. It is very hard to get one especially because of quotas on the first time applicants, but once you have it you don't have to worry anymore. To extend it all you need is to be gainfully employed (you're not tied to your original employer). Process is rather streamlined and after 6 years you receive C permit which is similar to the green card. (disclaimer: some cantons are better some are worse, in Geneva and Zurich for example they can issue L permit instead of B which is limited to 2 years without notifying the applicant, basically you learn that you have L when it's too late...)<p>I agree that a better system must exist: Of late, I have come to the realization that the H1B is an evil system which is basically a form of white-collar slavery. However, it is going to be hard to build a scalable, robust system that benefits current citizens without exploiting future citizens.",1353943344

A few others have provisions for you to attend only 1 or 2 years of an accredited law school, and then do self-study for the remaining portion without actually earning a J.D. as a prerequisite (Maine, New York, Wyoming). But even in these states you typically have to engage in some kind of approved course of study, although at least in California, this <i>can</i> be via an online law course.<p>I haven't looked into the others, but at one point I looked into it in California, and the two options are: 1) attend an unaccredited law school (could be an online one) for the equivalent of a 4-year course of study, and take certain exams along the way; or 2) follow a 4-year approved course of independent study supervised by a judge or a legal practice (the classic ""reading law"" apprenticeship option that was once standard, but has been phased out in most states).",1353943225

Anchor it with the highest price point and put it on various levels of discount to test out sales.<p><i>4. In App Purchase (IAP) Approaches</i><p>1) Currency - Have a virtual currency used to buy boosters and perform other actions. The user can earn currency in-game or purchase more via IAP for faster results. Examples: Farmville's currency<p>2) Energy - The user gets a certain amount of actions per energy, and the energy replenishes at a certain rate. Items can be used to replenish the energy, and the items can be bought via currency funded via IAP.<p>3) Unlocking Features - Have premium features such as extra levels or assistance unlockable via IAP. Examples: Angry Birds's Eagle<p>4) Chips - Another take on currency, for casino type games. Examples: Zynga's Poker<p>5) Freemium - Similar to unlocking features, except the basic app is always free<p>6) Subscription - Covered in section 5, can be paid for via IAP or externally (such as Dropbox)<p><i>5. Subscription</i><p>1) Live Data Feed - Have the user pay a monthly fee in return for up to date data (Newspaper subscriptions, Manazine subscriptions, Stock Ticker Data)<p>2) Pay Per Data Usage - Have the user pay a recurring fee depending on how much they use (Examples: Dropbox)<p>3) Software As a Service - Pay for usage of the software as-you-go. I haven't seen a full SAAS mobile app yet but I think TaskRabbit is a close example.<p><i>6. Facebook</i><p>1)Facebook Approved Ad Providers(<a href=""http://developers.facebook.com/adproviders/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developers.facebook.com/adproviders/</a>)<p>2)Facebook Currency Purchases (Example: FarmVille)<p><i>7. Sponsors</i><p>1) This involves finding third party sponsors and placing them individually in the app. Example: You have an app about tennis, and instead of placing ad-network ads you find a tennis racket retailer willing to pay you $X per month or $Y per click through to their site<p><i>8. Email Lists</i><p>1) Promote Paid Products - Get paid on traffic/conversion or promote your own paid products<p>2) Drive Traffic to a Website for Conversions/Ad revenue<p><i>9. Merchandise</i><p>1) Angry Birds has plushies and other merchandise<p>2) Imgur has shirts<p>3) Starcrafts turned a YouTube video series into t-shirts and plushies with memorable characters<p>4) Sell other people's merchandise for affiliate sales (Special version of category 2, Affiliate networks)Sources and Useful Articles:<p><a href=""http://mobithinking.com/mobile-ad-network-guide"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mobithinking.com/mobile-ad-network-guide</a><p><a href=""http://www.seekomega.com/2010/12/a-comprehensive-comparison-guide-to-mobile-advertising-networks-infographic/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seekomega.com/2010/12/a-comprehensive-comparison-...</a><p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5112939/what-is-the-best-way-to-monetize-facebook-app"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5112939/what-is-the-best-...</a><p><a href=""http://onlineincometeacher.com/money/30-ways-your-website-can-earn-you-money/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlineincometeacher.com/money/30-ways-your-website-ca...</a><p><a href=""http://www.business2community.com/blogging/how-to-monetize-your-site-50-ways-0246733"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.business2community.com/blogging/how-to-monetize-y...</a>",1353942736

Turmoil. War.<p>This reminded me of the story of my ex-wife's grand-mother who around 1942 or so went very closed to the WW2 Easter front lines dressed up as a man (that's what the legend says, anyway) to meet her husband, my wife's grand-father, who was serving in the Romanian Army. Nine months later, July 1943, their first kid was born, my ex-father-in-law. ~60 years later my ex-wife was trying to explain to me that we shouldn't have kids because times ""are to unstable, we don't have enough money etc"". So there's that ...<p>A little OT, my ex-wife's grand-father was quite a man, he got wounded 3 times on the Eastern front, and even though he had been raised in a traditional, Romanian peasant family he said that he couldn't believe in God anymore after what he had seen in there. After the war he returned to Romania and because he used to be an elementary-school teacher before WW2 and had experience with kids he was in charge with running a foster-home where he took care of orphaned children for a while, until things around the country settled down a bit. Those kids still looked at him as a father-like figure well into them growing up as adults and becoming grand-parents themselves, a bunch of them were present at his funeral 65 years after he had taken care of them. So there's that again :)",1353942698

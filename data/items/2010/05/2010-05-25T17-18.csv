1378055,comment,1377077,1377077,0,0,agentultra,,,"<i>I usually say ""I agree. Sad, isn't it. Ah, well.""</i><p>A wise opening anecdote. ""Dead language"" trolls have very little experience and even less wit. If you bother trying to spend the time to properly refute their arguments, they'll go off on a tangent about market share, mind share, and other very ephemeral things. It's often easier to let them walk away feeling right and get back to business.<p>Dead-language-haters are in my experience, are a vapid and eccentric lot. The majority of them have a lot of criticism for something they have absolutely no experience with or knowledge of. Damian does a great job of pointing this out in the interview without being as snarky as myself. He has an infinite amount of patience for Perl's critics it seems. I cannot count the number of times he's had to repeat the same arguments over and over. Even with the overwhelming amount of evidence he backs his statements with, people still keep asking him if Perl is a dead language.<p>That's why I think waving them along and getting back to work is a great idea. Let the smug weenies feel right and wear their proud little smiles as they walk away. I'm sure their satisfaction with themselves will keep them coding for many weeks to come. In the mean time real people with real work to do can get back to doing what they do best. In their un-hip dead-language of choice.<p>Great interview, Damian. :)",1274810228

Or that the quality of printing in 2006 was so bad that it would be completely unacceptable by the mass of consumers today? I don't find either of these even remotely credible.<p>As to brand: I don't buy it, not for a moment. In fact, I have difficulty believing that you're serious. Anyone can go online now and buy generic inks for their printer if they care to look, for less cost (often with hacked refurbished containers). When this generic ink gets worse results than the original stock ink (which came with the printer), do you believe that people will blame the printer? Seriously?<p>As to iPad / iPhone crashing, that wouldn't be very new, would it? Safari on my iPod Touch crashed (silently, to the home screen) maybe 8 times a day back when I still used it. My iPod Nano regularly crashes (hard lock, needs resetting) after adding and removing mp3s in iTunes, when playback was paused at the time of device insertion on an mp3 that was removed. My estimation of the quality of Apple software, from my experience, is not high. But this is all besides the point.",1274809432

1378026,comment,1376930,1377497,0,0,wkornewald,,,"Well, it's impossible to support absolutely everything of QuerySet. Also, it's likely that Django's official NoSQL support will be nothing more than what you get with this backend, so I'd say you can not actually call this a backend. :) In fact, this backend already provides more features than App Engine provides natively! So, you can actually get very far with it.<p>Indexing is planned for a later phase and we'll implement it in a way that is reusable between nonrel backends. In particular, this will be a separate optional module. The Django team probably will only support features that are the DB provides natively and that map to QuerySet (IOW, no map/reduce or other DB-specific features for which no SQL equivalent exists). By moving the indexing features into a separate module we can have the best of both worlds. Beginners don't get disturbed by automatically created indexes and advanced developers can achieve higher productivity because they can understand the automatically generated indexes.",1274809301

We are now considering starting a ""European branch"" that would operate out of the Netherlands, and I've been tasked with investigating how to organize our new shipping systems.  We plan to ship only within the EU from the Netherlands store, and would continue shipping to other areas from the U.S.  My question is, does anyone have any experience shipping within Europe that can share their experience?  One thing I'm unable to find is any kind of European shipping estimate api; for UPS, DHL, and USPS, we use XML apis to get shipping quotes for our customers on the site before they check out.  I contacted DHL about an XML API for Europe, but they weren't very helpful (basically they just told me to call the Netherlands, which I have a few times but haven't gotten any responses).  If there are no apis, do people generally just use shipping tables?<p>Any experience anyone has with this would be very helpful.",1274808177

1377961,comment,1377077,1377863,0,0,elblanco,,,"IMHO, the things that Perl really has to do are no so much the clever syntax designs and run-times etc. which while cool to people interested in languages and how they work, don't really allow the language itself to be used in larger scoped work. What Perl needs is a robust standard library that supports the kinds of things that people want to do with languages, like build interfaces, or solid web frameworks. Even better would be retargeting Perl to other languages, like a Perl->JS (so I can write Perl code for a browser) or Perl->JVM (so I can build the kinds of things I need that run on the JVM) compiler rather than building a runtime (Parrot), and re-targeting many languages to that platform.<p>Don't get me wrong, Parrot and Perl 6 are all worthy efforts. But I'm not sure they will have the kind of impact towards growth of the language and userbase that Perl needs. Perl desperately needs better OO syntax and support for functional programming paradigms. But syntax is syntax, libraries are what make a language useful in today's day and age.",1274807617

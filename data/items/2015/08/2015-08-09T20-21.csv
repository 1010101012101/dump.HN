That inevitable task may be borne out of the CEO being tired of answering why they didn&#x27;t go for a .com.<p>There has actually been no justification as to why a .com is required.  Simply saying non .com is &quot;marginal&quot; and &quot;it signals weakness&quot; is not a root reason.  All it shows is that some people have a differing opinion on the value of a .com and not agreeing with &#x27;them&#x27; means you&#x27;re weak.<p>I personally do feel more comfortable having a good sounding .com, but if I&#x27;m going to do it, it has to be for the right reasons.  That I don&#x27;t think has been clearly expressed in this essay.<p>My reasons are that it&#x27;s a global identity, globally indexable by search engines, the most common global LTD and therefore the most memorable by end users, and more stable from a root server point of view.  Would I think a startup with another name is weak? No. I would assume that they understand the implications of a non-.com TLD.",1439153804

From that experience, I can basically take any idea (or startup) from day 1 to around year 3. I can: register the (sub)domains, setup email, setup all servers on almost any provider (aws, rackspace, linode, digitalocean), setup git on github/bitbucket and manage deploys/versioning and continuous integration with jenkins, manage bugs and teams in jira across multiple projects, take an app from nothing in most languages (java/dropwizard, groovy/grails, ruby/rails/sinatra, node/express) to an app/api that meets almost all business requirements, write data heavy frontends for admin panels (backbone, angular, react more recently), setup and administer databases (postgres, mysql, elasticsearch), setup and implement caching strategies in redis, and setup queues/background jobs.<p>Despite feeling confident about my experience, I feel like it would be easier to interview right now if I had just stuck to java for the past 6 years and practiced algos/data structures slowly over that time period. Now that I&#x27;m more mature and I&#x27;ve seen the landscape, I want to do two things:
1) Gain a deep understanding of a single language/ecosystem. 
2) Get deep expertise in a particular domain. Things that innately interest me include graph problems (vehicle routing), distributed computing (things like kafka), and machine learning. I really want to dig deep and get good at one of these longer term.<p>Beyond personal interest in these domains, I want to be in a better career position in 4-5 years, so perceived future demand for the skills would weigh in to my decision as well.

The most obvious metric of whether you have a good name or not is whether it&#x27;s already been taken, especially by someone else with their own idea and access to 6 or 10 or 20 dollars per year or whatever the annual registration fee is. The space for available names (the &quot;name space&quot;, if you will ;) is still large enough that being very stubborn about your startup&#x27;s names is probably hazardous, and certainly not a sign of health.<p>Ignoring the minutiae of the rest of the post (and you can argue I&#x27;m really doing this quite intently), I think I agree with the principle. The name&#x27;s not that important. If you&#x27;re processing financial transactions you could be named <i>Pay</i>Pal, sure, but you could also be named Stripe or Square or BrainTree[0] or any of dozens of weird names that make no sense at face value (if these names are in fact deeply meaningful, I&#x27;d be curious to hear the stories... privately, or on Twitter, not necessarily here/now).<p>There are reasonable things to get stuck on - if you&#x27;re committed to being a B2C product or service, and others are telling you your startup is more of a B2B idea, then you should wrestle with that. But you shouldn&#x27;t be wrestling over the name for such a great deal of time. If Paul Graham tells you to change your name when you&#x27;re pitching to him so you can get a .com, you probably shouldn&#x27;t (he argues) protest all that much.<p>I don&#x27;t think I hold his view as strongly as he does, but I&#x27;m neither a successful VC nor widely respected in Silicon Valley, so his argument about perception is admittedly a little self-fulfilling and it seems impossible to reject.<p>[0] the irony is not lost on me, now that I check, that BrainTree doesn&#x27;t own braintree.com - although first glance suggests Square only has squareup.com, square.com redirects to it; I&#x27;d be interested to hear Graham&#x27;s thoughts on that, and I think it would signal strongly whether I understood his argument correctly.",1439153180

In fact, the first transform that a tracing JIT does to the code (trace extraction) can be seen as removing every inbound CF edge except the loop head (leaving them in the deoptimized version of the trace).<p>One reason for that is that it makes optimization of the trace a lot easier since every forward dataflow problem (e.g. constant propagation or type inference) becomes more precise :<p><pre><code>  if a is a string && b is a string
     x = concat(a,b)
  else if a is a int && b is a int
     x = add_int(a,b)
  else ...

  bail if !(a is a int && b is a int)
  x = add_int(a,b)
  ...

It seems none of these services is deployed across the globe. There&#x27;s a need for a blazing fast, reliable service with granular, comprehensive data, that is performing well for millions of requests across the globe, be it for mobile or web traffic.<p>I found a great base[2] and I think Go is a perfect language for this kind of service.<p>Here are the free checkers I tested the other day, the IP is a good example for incomplete data:<p><pre><code>    checkers = [

10031420,comment,10030036,10031362,0,0,sdevlin,,,"The authentication mode for GCM is sort of fragile. While nonce reuse is always bad, it&#x27;s particularly disastrous in GCM in that it immediately leaks the authentication key. Similarly, using GCM with a truncated authentication tag makes forgery easier than you&#x27;d expect and again leaks the authentication key in the process.<p>GCM is also difficult to implement in software for the same reasons AES is: the high-performance implementation strategies tend to rely on precomputed tables. This puts memory pressure on servers that handle a large number of keys concurrently. Table-based implementations also tend to expose cache-timing side channels. Fortunately, modern Intel machines have instructions (e.g. PCLMULQDQ) that aid implementations, though I&#x27;m not sure how widespread their use is in practice.<p>To be very clear, GCM is still a fine choice, and much safer than composing authentication and encryption yourself.<p>If you have access to it, NaCl&#x27;s Secret Box is a good choice that avoids these problems. Libsodium implements NaCl and is pretty widely available, I think. OCB is also a good choice, though I haven&#x27;t seen many implementations of this.<p>EDIT: For those interested, Niels Ferguson&#x27;s criticism of GCM (<a href=""http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/documents/comments/CWC-GCM/Ferguson2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/documents/comment...</a>) is a great read.

I can even derive formal proofs for simple DSLs when I have too.<p>I never had any issues with mixing semantic properties of DSLs on any level of abstraction - and the higher the abstraction level, the easier it is to mix without caring at all about the underlying semantics.<p>For example - I&#x27;ve got a generic PEG frontend language. I can mix it into nearly any combination of execution semantics, because it&#x27;s high level enough, and it has an intermediate representation which can be trivially mapped into pretty much anything at a very little cost (because of simplicity of requirements). Why should I care about soundness of the whole mix while I can easily prove correctness of this very last step of translation, and this is enough to ensure the rest.<p>> There are a ridiculous number of ways to combine these things in ways that totally kill type soundness, confluence, etc.<p>Then do not combine these things in the unsound ways. As simple as that.<p>For example, this is how I&#x27;m using Prolog embedded in an eager somewhat-functional host: the host DSL is used to define transforms over ASTs, including simple flattening transforms that derive sequences of equations (i.e., Prolog terms). Then the Prolog code is used to ask <i>questions</i> about these systems of equations. This way many typical internal compiler tasks are dead simple but yet reasonably efficient (and for some of the most important things I can even use Datalog instead, with all its cool optimisations). The only point where the Prolog world is interacting with the rest of the system is via these lists of equations, so I do not have to care how to reason about WAM interaction with a memory-managed eager functional semantics, all is well compartmentalised.<p>> None of these three assumptions are true for most of the eDSLs engineers might want to write down in general.<p>How is it so? Everything is still boiling down to one of the &quot;fundamental&quot; execution models. Higher level semantics are added as sequences of well-understood, provable, trivial transforms all the way down to such fundamental blocks, for which, as you said, we have at least 30-60 years worth of understanding.<p>The very high level semantics are added independently of any fundamental blocks, with a transform to a specific execution model being added at the very last moment and it is always trivial enough.<p>> a framework that lets you get unsound bullcrap from two perfectly sound things<p>If the source language is sound, each of the target languages are sound, and all the transforms in between are sound, then the result is sound and robust.<p>> isn&#x27;t a solution to the (e)DSL problem<p>In my practice it is a solution indeed. Every eDSL I design is dead simple in implementation and very rarely I have to add something new to my current toolbox. With problem domains ranging from 3D CAD applications to hardware design.",1439150860

Large machine learning data sets are getting into terabytes in size, and the biggest bottleneck with GPUs is the PCIe link limiting them to 16GB/s and adds a whole lot of additional latency. In our case, we have direct connection to DRAM (We&#x27;ve been looking at DDR4 and HMC). In addition, we have designed the architecture to allow massive scalability with up to 384 GB/s of aggregate chip-to-chip bandwidth... NVIDIA&#x27;s NVLink is aiming for 80GB/s in the 2018/2019 timeframe and will still need a connected CPU to issue jobs.<p>EDIT: I should also mention that our chip is fully general purpose, but we perform really well when it comes to dense matrix math (Most deep learning), with a 10 to 15x efficiency advantage over GPU. Our real killer app is FFTs, which GPUs do abysmally on, and our current benchmarks are showing a 25x efficiency advantage over the best DSPs and FPGAs built for large constellation FFTs.",1439150840

10031367,comment,10029840,10031125,0,0,lyha,,,"MQTT is a protocol with public specification for lightweight client / message broker communications, allowing publish/subscribe exchanges. Multiple implementations of client libraries and brokers (Mosquitto, JoramMQ...) exists and are virtually compatible. MQTT just specifies the transport, and vaguely the application part (i.e. how data is handled and possibly stored, how clients are authorized...). The spec is not clear if data consumed on a topic is only real-time or possibly persisted. The spec doesn&#x27;t state anything about how the message broker implementing MQTT could/should scale.<p>On the other hand, Apache Kafka is a message broker based on an internal &quot;commit log&quot;: its focus is storing massive ammount of data on disk, and allow consumption in real-time or later (as long as data is still available on disk). It&#x27;s designed to be deployable as cluster of multiple node, with good scalabily properties. Kafka uses its own network protocol.<p>So you are comparing two different things here: a standard pub/sub protocol (with multiple implementations), and a specific message storing/distributing software, vaguley of the same family with its own protocol.<p>I&#x27;d say that if you need to store massive amount of messages, to ensure batch processing, look more at Kafka. If you have lots of clients/apps exchanging messages in real-time on many indpendants topics look more at the MQTT (or even AMQP) message brokers implementations.",1439150626

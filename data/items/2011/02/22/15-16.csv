Integrating new technologies into an existing product can be a real challenge. If all you do is evolve, there inevitably comes a point where your product is behind the curve. Basecamp and Fogbugz are good products that were probably great at some point, but now they just seem old and crusty compared to products like Asana and Pivotal Tracker.<p>I'd argue that in order to stay competitive, you need to either evolve rapidly enough to keep up with the pace of technology (Gmail, Facebook), or rethink and rebuild the product before it falls behind.",1298390177
2250218,comment,2249459,2250016,0,0,T-hawk,,,"What you say is true for the Atari 7800, not the 2600.  The 2600 had no protection or verification at all; it wasn't remotely thought of when the 2600 was designed in 1977.  The 2600 happily runs any ROM at all containing executable 6502 machine code.  There isn't even any BIOS in the 2600.  Literally all it does at startup is point the program counter to an address within the ROM address space.<p>The 2600 was walled-by-obscurity for its first several years, since the video chip was custom designed by Atari and not documented publicly, plus the tools to write and compile and run 6502 assembler were fairly primitive.  But by 1982 or so, enough reverse-engineering had been done and the tools had matured and enough Atari expertise was available on the hiring market that the system was essentially fully open.<p>(I've been there - I wrote an Atari 2600 game my freshman year of college in 1997.)",1298390177

That is, if the doctor, hospital, or lab says that it costs $1,300, but the insurance company wants to pay $700, I'm stuck for the other $600. The result is that in order to meet the high deductible (at which point I no longer have to pay out of pocket like this), I pay way beyond the amount of the deductible since only the approved rates are applied. In practice, I end up paying out 175% or more of the deductible amount.<p>I suspect that our experience will soon become the norm, if its not already.",1298390044

I noticed one of the only non-CDN assets we had was favico.ico, which was being requested from origin servers along with every request, putting an unneeded load on Apache. Ideally we might put static assets like that on something like Nginx, but short term I was looking into how I could reduce the (albeit small) load created by favicon requests without changing the application architecture.<p>Ruling out Nginx, the pickle was that I should probably rewrite requests to domain.com/favico.ico to cdn.domain.com/favico.ico. But that rewrite has just as much or more httpd overhead as just serving the favico, with an extra client-side performance hit as the client has to do an extra http request to follow the 301.<p>I ended up with just using a <link> tag in <head>, which should at least get modern browsers off Apache's back.

Ventura Blvd. and 82 are basically the same El Camino Real.  The 101 (which parallels Ventura Blvd for quite a distance) is marked as El Camino Real, as is 82 in Silicon Valley.  Both have foundations in the Spanish missionary trail.  They're basically two sections of one very long road.<p>If you've seen Steve Blank's presentation on the 'secret history' of Silicon Valley you'll see where I draw the parallels.  Lockheed Martin, Rocketdyne, General Dynamics, Litton, Rockwell, and many others were once based there.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC_RxWN_xo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC_RxWN_xo</a><p>But the divergence was inevitable I suppose - the valley up north has gotten comparatively nicer in the past 15 years, though, as San Fernando's fortunes have faded a bit.  The SF valley now basically lacks a coherent high technology business base and all the aerospace and defense has moved out.  It's been replaced by Hollywood entertainment, healthcare, porno, import/export, and a bunch of other smaller industries and some light manufacturing.  It's not defunct in any way - it's still pretty nice, but it's just not as nice as up north.   Most of the newer wealth is in other areas of LA.<p>Both are nearly entirely made up of suburban housing and low laying office parks and are situated just outside of the main urban area.  The biggest/tallest buildings are the chain hotels and a select few office buildings.  Strip malls are everywhere, which is where all the good food is.<p>It's an interesting kind of an 'alternate reality' in the other end of California that many people aren't aware of.  Personally I'd rather live bayside in Santa Monica or San Francisco (and have in both), but to each his own, some people like the suburbs more.",1298389171

I know it’s there, and I figured I’d throw it out to HN to see if we could nail it.  Being a longtime reader of HN I have a lot of respect for the community’s feedback. While reading HN today I got the idea to involve the community in an experiment to see if we can come up with a better description for my startup.  I’m curious what kind of feedback I will get, and if this could even work, so here it goes. The startup is Talentopoly.com. The current description on the home page is “A community for programmers, designers, and IT professionals to share their work, get feedback, post links and learn.” This isn’t the best description, but I’ll get to the reason why in a minute. Let’s tackle the concept first. It’s a site for designers, developers, and IT pros to share links to articles, blog posts, tutorials, and resources (i.e. icon sets, frameworks, books, etc.). The intent is to be a place for links that help programmers, designers, and IT professionals learn and hone their craft. It’s not a place to post tech news or troubleshoot code. Here are some examples. A link to pre-order the new Lean Startup book or a blog post about storing objects in FluidInfo = good. A link to news that Eric Schmidt is stepping down as CEO of Google or that new MacBook Pros were released = bad. The hope is to keep the quality of the links being posted high by making the site invite-only. There are other facets to the site such as finding others to work with, asking questions, and hosting your resume. I’d love to cover those features but I don’t want to make the description too long. The problem with the current description is that it gives passers-by the idea that primarily it’s a place to post their work and get feedback. Sites like Forrst and Dribbble are great for this already and it’s not something I want to focus on. I want to better convey that Talentopoly is good for staying up to date on and discovering new techniques and tools for your profession if you are a programmer, designer, or IT professional.  To put it simply, a place talented people go to post high-quality links.  I want Talentopoly to do for designers, developers and IT professionals what our RSS and Twitter lists don’t always do -- provide great links. The description needs to be one phrase that is ideally two sentences long, 140 characters (thanks Twitter).  I’d like it if we could keep this conversation on the topic of the site’s description instead of its similarities to other sites. So with that said, what do you think would be the best description?",1298387165

I much prefer the opposite approach, such as in Jack Crenshaw's ""Let's Write a Compiler"" (<a href=""http://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/</a>) - You can make things complicated if you want, but the basics aren't that hard, and helping people to realize ""<i>you can do this</i>, you don't need to be some kind of programmer demigod"" is very empowering.<p>Also, I recommend reading the source to tools you admire - seeing other peoples' dirty hacks can be a good reminder that shipping something useful beats waiting until it's perfect.",1298387131

Most people switching jobs will not have to worry about insurability if they are switching to an established company with an extant group plan. Working for such an employer is in fact one of the only ways many people can get health insurance.<p>A six or twelve month wait is also unusual on switching jobs. Generally it will take ~60 days from hire for the new insurance to kick in, but rarely more than 90.",1298387022

But the more usual meaning in science, at least, is that the lack of evidence for something doesn't <i>by itself</i> constitute evidence against it (or at least, it's evidence with weight arbitrarily close to zero). You need something more, such as absence of evidence <i>and</i> a reason to believe that finding such evidence, if it existed, would have been at least somewhat probable.<p>(Which is of course why the example in this post is doing the calculation of what observations we would've expected under each scenario.)",1298386807

  b) Why is Lua more cost-effective than embeddable JavaScript interpreters considering the
     following:
     1. the cost of learning how to embed and work with the Lua interpreter
     2. the cost of learning the scripting language with all its implications: a different
        syntax, a different way to work enforced by its standard library (ex. 1-indexed
        arrays), new quirks (ex. commenting nested arrays), etc.
     3. the cost of training people from other areas which are already accustomed to

Which is completely useless, just like your assertion.<p>And I know what you meant, but you&#x27;re also wrong. A JSON object is only a string before being interpreted. An x-www-form-urlencoded is actually a map in which values can be arrays instead of primitives. Such forms often correspond to domain models with a clear definition.<p>There&#x27;s also no such thing as &quot;<i>obviously bad data</i>&quot;. All data is good in the proper context, therefore automatic conversions that try to make this distinction do not make sense.

I&#x27;m talking 50k+ for 1 dog to test your device on. don&#x27;t even get me started on human centric trials.<p>3) risk of litigation. look at the current mess with vaginal meshes: boston scientific, medtronic, and others are paying out huge sums of money over faulty tech that was approved by the fda.<p>4) regulatory overhead. navigation of the fda and ce mark beaurocracies is complicated enough that it is an entire industry in itself. we have a full team working on our project full time just to make sure we stay within the law, to meet with the fda and eu, and to do all our governmental paperwork.<p>5) ip law. medical companies sue eachother for patent infringement all. the. time. if you aren&#x27;t checking to make sure you aren&#x27;t violating patents, you are exposing yourself to huge amounts of risk. hundreds of millions of dollars of risk.<p>sigh.<p>plus all the overhead to navigate each hospital&#x27;s unique purchasing process,  dealing with different regulatory requirements in different countries, different radio spectrum requirements (if your tech uses any type of emitors) in different countries, traceability requirements in manufacturing, certified manufacturing sites, and all the rest.<p>sigh.<p>but the good news is that I&#x27;m an expert at navigating these treacherous waters and am looking for a new job. if anyone at shift labs (or other medical device manufacturer) is interested in a chat, feel free to reach out.",1426572702

A developer has to build new housing stock <i>somewhere</i>. In a developed area that commonly means demolishing old low density housing to build new higher density housing. But if the low density housing has tenants that won&#x27;t leave because they&#x27;re paying below market rents, developers can&#x27;t do that.<p>Rent control also contributes to high rents in another way: No matter how constrained supply becomes, tenants in rent controlled apartments don&#x27;t feel any pressure to free up supply by moving somewhere else.

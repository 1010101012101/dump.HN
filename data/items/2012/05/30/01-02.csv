However, unlike Haskell, in Loop, a \n   sequence is guaranteed to execute in order.\n</code></pre>\nA do block is syntactic sugar over >>= (bind) and is monadic in nature.  And the IO monad (which is relevant to the example that involved printing things.) is a construct which guarantees that the parts will execute in order.  That's kinda the point.  That he got it wrong makes me not trust the language.  He shouldn't claim to have been ""Inspired by Haskell"" if he doesn't really know it.<p>Also in Haskell the pattern [x:xs] matches a list with one element, which is a list with at least one element, so [[1,2,3]] (== (1:2:3:[]):[]) gets matched with x = 1 and xs = [2,3].  That differs from loop's pattern matching.  But [x] still matches a list with only one element.  What does [x:[]] match?  If you are going by [x:xs] matches [1] with x = 1 and xs = [], then surely [x:[]] will match as well.<p>Also, if you are making a functional programming language, you know one that uses recursions instead fo for loops, why do you call it Loop?  I didn't see one loop in any of the examples.  It's just silly.<p>EDIT:\nOh, and if Nothing really is a subtype of everything, then 5 + Nothing should typecheck right?  Not "" It is a type error to attempt to compute with Nothing.""  Since Nothing is a Integer, since it subtypes everything.  I don't understand.  Is + special in hating Nothing?  Nothing.add(5) would return Nothing, right?  So why not Nothing + 5.  Oh, but wait, Nothing is a subtype of string, so Nothing + 5 means string concatenation, right?  You did say a + b where a is a string casts b to a string, didn't you?  It's inconsistent and I don't think it has the proper semantics.",1338343197

4040978,comment,4040022,4040022,4,0,conductrics,,,"This is part of a larger class of problems known as reinforcement learning problems. A/B testing when used for decision optimization can be thought of (sort of) as just a form of bandit using an epsilon-first approach. You play random until some threshold (using some sort of arbitrary hypothesis test), which is the learning period, then you exploit your knowledge and play estimate best option.\nEpsilon-greedy is nice because it tends to work well regardless, and isn't completely affected by drift (nonstationarity of the environment). \nOne heuristic to use for deciding between using a bandity approach is to ask , is the information I will glean perishable or not pershible? For perishable problems the opportunity cost to learn is quite high, since you have less time to recoup your investment in learning (reducing the uncertainty in your estimates).\nAlso, finding the optimal answer in these situations may be less important than just ensuring that you are playing from the set of high performing actions.\nWe have a couple of blog posts on related issues \n<a href=""http://www.conductrics.com/blog/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.conductrics.com/blog/</a>",1338343151

4040939,comment,4039314,4039314,14,0,tokenadult,,,"The original StackExchange thread is an interesting read. For the job applicant (any job applicant), the problem is always how to make an affirmative case that an employer ought to offer the job to you and not to someone else. The commenters on StackExchange and here on HN are mostly commenting from that perspective, that the job applicant has to figure out how to excel over other job applicants in making a strong case for being hired.<p>Some comments here are about the issue of how companies should hire in the general case. Because that is a frequently asked question here on HN, and because that has been the subject of much research, I'll recycle some electrons here to provide a FAQ on the general issue. The review article ""The Validity and Utility of Selection Models in Personnel Psychology: Practical and Theoretical Implications of 85 Years of Research Findings""<p><a href=""http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%20Validity%20and%20Utility%20Psychological%20Bulletin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%...</a><p>sums up, current to 1998, much of the HUGE peer-reviewed professional literature on the industrial and organizational psychology devoted to business hiring practices. There are many kinds of hiring screens, such as resume reviews for job experience, telephone interviews, in-person interviews, checks for academic credentials, and so on. There is much published study research on how job applicants perform after they are hired in a wide variety of occupations.<p>The overall summary of the industrial psychology research in reliable secondary sources is that two kinds of job screening procedures work reasonably well (but only about at the 0.5 level, standing alone). One is a general cognitive ability test (an IQ-like test, such as the Wonderlic personnel screening test). Another is a work-sample test, where the applicant does an actual task or group of tasks like what the applicant will do on the job if hired. Each of these kinds of tests has about the same validity in screening applicants for jobs, with the general cognitive ability test better predicting success for applicants who will be trained into a new job. Neither is perfect (both miss some good performers on the job, and select some bad performers on the job), but both are better than anything else that has been tested in rigorous research, across a wide variety of occupations. So if you are hiring for your company, it's a good idea to think about how to build a work-sample test into all of your hiring processes.<p>For legal reasons in the United States (the same consideration does not apply in other countries), it is difficult to give job applicants a straight-up IQ test (as was commonplace in my parents' generation) as a routine part of a hiring process. The Griggs v. Duke Power, 401 U.S. 424 (1971) case in the United States Supreme Court<p><a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196978&q=Griggs+Duke+Power&hl=en&as_sdt=2,24"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196...</a><p>held that cognitive ability tests used in hiring that could have a ""disparate impact"" on applicants of some protected classes must ""bear a demonstrable relationship to successful performance of the jobs for which it was used."" In other words, a company that wants to use a test like the Wonderlic, or like the SAT, or like the current WAIS or Stanford-Binet IQ tests, in a hiring process had best conduct a specific validation study of the test related to performance on the job in question. Some companies do the validation study, and use IQ-like tests in hiring. Other companies use IQ-like tests in hiring and hope that no one sues (which is not what I would advise any company). Note that a brain-teaser-type test used in a hiring process might be illegal if it can be shown to have disparate impact on some job applicants and is not supported by a validation study demonstrating that the test is related to successful performance on the job. Companies outside the United States are regulated by different laws.",1338342191

My mother had a lot of medical issues that I studied in detail. I have several of my own that I have also studied at great length, and I used to be an EMT. Waiting around and going through a tedious process for a new doctor to ""catch up"" with you is frustrating.<p>A lot of people aren't like this, though. I have a friend who, after weeks of not feeling well, had, at one time, read pages and pages of research on a particular disease and had convinced herself that this was the thing she had, this was why she was sick, and this was what she needed treatment for. What she failed to neglect was the title of the paper -- she had diagnosed herself with <i>kennel cough</i>.<p>As much valuable information as there is available on the internet, I also feel like the internet breeds hypochondriacs like nobody's business.<p>So I don't really think we need a change in the way healthcare is delivered, exactly. I think what we need is more education for would-be doctors about how to better engage and involve a patient in their own care and how to talk to a patient sincerely about their condition and evaluate the people who just googled something vs. the ones who genuinely know what they're talking about, and then how to work with the latter.<p>Good doctors will do this naturally, but a lot of doctors will take the attitude that they are the doctor, they know best because they have been to medical school. They may well have a better overall understanding of things, which can very well be extremely important when looking at how diseases and medications interact in conjunction with and affect one another. However, there simply isn't enough time for them to become experts on everything. There should be more emphasis on this fact and more instruction on how to work with the patients to make them the experts so that they can be more involved in their care.<p>I feel like I'm not making my point well, but this is starting to ramble a bit, so hopefully that makes sense.",1338341741

The problem at the core of libertarianism is the slavish belief that the 'free market' is somehow guaranteed to produce results beneficial to society as a whole, or in the more sociopathic cases (which I suspect are the majority), benefit for themselves at the expense of others in a way that government cannot.<p>This argument neglects the fact that there does not exist any such beast as the 'free market' except in the platonic form - real transcational characteristics of goods and services, as well as the characteristics of the medium of exchange, always lead to a particular form of market emerging. Specifically, because of the fact that capital compounds capital - it is in the very nature of unregulated markets to concentrate resources in the hands of a few.<p>Why should we therefore be satisfied with 'free' markets that lead to enormous concentrations of resources in the hands of small numbers of individuals, far skewed away from the distributions of human ability according to measures of intelligence, aptitude or what have you? A market is a physical system to be engineered to produce the social outcome of most benefit. How you decide what is of 'most benefit' has some contention, but I'm pretty sure concentrating resources created by a majority in the hands of a minority is not it.",1338339691

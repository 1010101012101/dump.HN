It helped that I was in CS/math/science courses. Questions tended to be semi-fun <i>puzzles</i> instead of memorization.<p>Actually, one of my favorite memories from university is from an algorithms test. We had to find nearest smallest neighbors, or something like that, in O(n lg n) time. Our professor was good, and an algorithms guy, so I was surprised when I realized it could be done with just two sweeps across the list [O(n)]. When I showed him (I was wondering if the question mentioning &#x27;divide and conquer&#x27; was a hint or a restriction), he couldn&#x27;t believe he&#x27;d missed it.",1377273583

6264382,comment,6259391,6262586,1,0,mtdewcmu,,,"&quot;Many irrational numbers are easy to identify unambiguously.&quot;<p>Absolutely. Cantor proved that an infinite number of others can&#x27;t be identified at all, because they outnumber all possible descriptions. Some numbers can only be described by an infinitely long list of digits, one that can&#x27;t be produced by a Turing machine and contains an infinite amount of irreducible information. The Kolmogorov complexity is infinite.<p>Newton&#x27;s equations describe a mathematical model of the universe that agrees well with measurements taken under familiar conditions. Einstein&#x27;s equations describe a different mathematical model, one that has good agreement with experiment over a much wider range of conditions than Newton&#x27;s. But general relativity has well-known problems. Its equations give nonsense solutions under some circumstances, e.g. singularities. Physical theories are models that predict the outcomes of experiments. They&#x27;re reductionist out of necessity. It&#x27;s unknown and probably unknowable as to whether a perfect model is possible, but there are likely things that can&#x27;t be reduced.",1377273568
6264381,comment,6262547,6262766,1,0,dragonwriter,,,"> I feel similarly with the phrase &quot;beg the question&quot;, which in common usage now means simply &quot;raises the question&quot; or &quot;invites the question&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t bother me because I think people who use it this way are stupid; it bothers me because there is no synonym for &quot;begs the question&quot; which is equally succinct.<p>Since the original sense of &quot;begs the question&quot; is inherently intransitive, and the modern sense is inherently transitive (and, further, the original sense  can be rationalized as an intransitive version of the modern sense where the implied object is the proposition that the argument was attempting to justify), there is no conflict between the original and modern sense, so I don&#x27;t see the problem.<p>Also, the original sense of &quot;begs the question&quot; can be equivalently stated as &quot;is a circular argument&quot; which is nearly as succinct and uses words in something much more like there usual English senses, so even if the more modern sense of &quot;begs the question&quot; could create semantic ambiguity (which it can&#x27;t, since its syntactically distinct), I <i>still</i> wouldn&#x27;t agree that much useful was lost.",1377273535

But if you do, you will not get noticed.<p>When you are growing up I think it&#x27;s very difficult for kids and teenagers to avoid pressure especially for something as prevalent as this.  I feel like &quot;nerd&quot; fashion is in so you see that a lot in society as rappers and athletes sport that look so that aspect of the nerd life is acceptable presently.<p>The other aspects of nerdery that might not be socially acceptable to teenagers are playing with robots, programming a web app, and building a mobile application.  To me if you like doing things like that you are probably the type of person okay with going into computer science or engineering.<p>Until that&#x27;s just as socially acceptable as joining the football team I doubt you&#x27;re going to see much mindset change around the idea of going into engineering vs traditional liberal arts.",1377273517

Instead, what you measure is one of the eigenvalues of a linear operator that acts on a wavefunction (which particular eigenvalue?  You can&#x27;t always predict this; hence the randomness in QM).  For each &quot;observable&quot; you want to measure (position, momentum, spin), there is a specific linear operator associated with it.

By the same logic, iPod was nothing special, just another mp3 player.<p>IE and XBox managed to muscle into an established market. This is <i>harder</i> than making a new market, and should very much be congratulated.<p>>  In fact with IE 6 he so badly misjudged the market that he assumed the game was over and didn&#x27;t even bother continuing development. IE 7 didn&#x27;t come out until 4 years later!<p>Not so much misjudged, but started seeing as a threat. IE development hit a wall because the meme that web-based apps will replace windows-based apps got popular, and Microsoft didn&#x27;t want to wipe out their own monopoly. IE4-IE6 were, at the time, absolutely crushingly good. IE6 is now remembered as the really bad browser, but that is because they stopped updating it, and in the later years it had to compete with much, much better browsers.<p>> You count XBox as a success, yet MS is in the hole over XBox by over a Billion dollars and will probably never make money on it, taking past losses and write-offs into account.<p>XBox also supports windows game development, strengthening their main money maker.

THEN we can infer from  the detector, the original state.<p>The reason it&#x27;s difficult to know the precise situation of a photon, in-flight, is because it&#x27;s been emitted from a moving target, whose precise state is difficult to control perfectly: a live atom.<p>Without having perfect control of the atom that sends off the spinning, oscillating particle, we have a hard time discerning the exact circumtances of the spin/oscillation imparted upon it. We can hazard guesses, but when we&#x27;re right, it&#x27;s only because we get lucky. Not because we controlled it.<p>EDIT: The reason is there are two factors driving the emission:<p>1. The external behavior of the electon shells<p>2. The internal nuclear behavior of the protons and neutrons (which do not behave simply as a clump of spherical marbles, the nucleus is it&#x27;s own volatile, nebulous construct)<p>And, oh yeah...\n3.

However, at a higher, more abstract level of accomplishing the organization&#x27;s goal, e.g. reliably performing a service, leadership connects everyone from the customer relations <i>up</i> to the CEO, down to the layers of task-doers.  This leadership is less about everyone, e.g., debugging at the same time, and more about everyone _paying_attention_ to the same activity, customer, project, mega-task at the same time.<p>Bad managers do foment underlings.  They don&#x27;t care when or how a task is done as long as it is checked off.  Good managers, however, keep everyone focused.  They know how to direct people so that their work is more than an isolated task...  it leverages the momentum of everyone else&#x27;s activity, creating a continuous end-to-end flow of information and materials in, through people, and back out to customers.  The care and dedication for the customer are communicated in parallel all the way from the customer to the last person to touch the code or material.<p>I like to think about a combustion engine as a useful metaphor.  It will work a little bit if timing is within a certain tolerance.  It works best when the timing is correct.  And it can be optimized for excellent performance.

Is Startbucks <i>really</i> undrinkable sludge to some people, or is only that way because of that sweet, sweet feeling of smug superiority that they feel when they say it?<p>I am one of the few that is nerdy enough to blind test myself and friends with things that have an entire culture of snobs around them -- a trait which I picked up after working in the audio industry for years (where people will believe and argue to the death about magical cable properties (give me measurements, or give me death!)).<p>If I could assemble enough coffee samples, I would love to put myself under test and see if one is empirically &quot;better&quot; to my taste buds. However, logistically it&#x27;s not possible.<p>That said, beer and wine is readily available, transportable, and easily testable! So, my girlfriend and I set up a tasting night a few months ago. We grabbed a 6 pack of every cheap beer in the grocery store (pbr, miller lite, Natural Ice, bud, etc..), and then a whole range of wines -- everything from the $70 2011 wine of the year, to a $3 ABC brand bottle. We randomized each trial, poured the wines into glasses and then left the room so others could enter so we wouldn&#x27;t influence their decisions (our attempt at setting up a double blind test). We had people log their impressions of each one, and then attempt to rate them in ascending order of &quot;quality.&quot;<p>After 4 or 5 trials (it stopped being fun around the 3rd set of trails) we called it quits and looked at everyone&#x27;s results. It was pretty interesting. In with cheep beer, there was only one consistent looser, and that with Miller Lite (I honestly expected it to be Natural Ice), the rest were all randomly distributed. No one could tell one from the other -- or if one was better than the other -- with any reliability. It actually made it a little frustrating while testing, as some people (including me) though they were being messed with by having several glasses all with the same beer.<p>The wine had similar results. No clear winner. Result were all over the place with the &quot;best&quot; tasting wine being different for each person each time. With my pallet, I couldn&#x27;t discern one as being &quot;better,&quot; so much as just &quot;different.&quot; This one is a little more X, while this one is a little more Y. It was an interesting experience. So, moral of the story, I only buy cheap wine now, because I honestly can&#x27;t taste the difference. That $70 bottle wasn&#x27;t even distinguishable from the rest.<p>I&#x27;ve rambled, but I highly suggest self testing! It&#x27;s fun, and I can now say that, empirically, Miller lite is undrinkable piss water to my taste buds :)",1377272650

I&#x27;ve done a lot of comparisons of game world simulators written in Go and Scala, accomplishing similar things with radically different memory footprints.  I think the difference has to do with the fact that everything you do in Scala produces tons of little objects for anonymous functions and loop iterators and so on.<p>For many applications this doesn&#x27;t matter, especially with how cheap RAM is.  But for some applications, such as mobile games and rented server space where your profitability is a function involving RAM cost per user, this can be very significant.",1377271978

One particularly striking result was that MBA graduates differences in pay between men and women was around $4,000 in favour of men - which, IIRC, she claimed could be accounted for by the fact that 57% of men chose to negotiate as compared to 7% of women. Those who negotiated, regardless of gender, tended to receive around $4,000 more than those who did not.<p>I think it very plausible that a lot of this sort of thing comes down to wanting to be fair, not wanting to be pushy - that sort of thing. Which generally works well with other women, but not necessarily so well if your boss is a man and prefers to communicate in a different style.

Both demonstrate concretely the essence of the weirdness.<p>(I&#x27;ll leave the rest below just to keep me honest about my ignorance.)\nit&#x27;s a provably special state where randomness allows it to have the needed characteristics for the math to work at all. [1]<p>Also disclaimer: I&#x27;m not a PhD physicist, just a BS in engineering physics. This is merely how I cope with the idea.<p>Think of it like this: given time, chaotic systems become unpredictable and noisy. An electron whizzing around an atom doesn&#x27;t need much time before it&#x27;s state is utterly unpredictable at any measurable level (Heisenberg Uncertainty assures this must happen eventually, and pretty fast it turns out).<p>So what if we isolate that little electron from the outside world? Then even the universe becomes uncertain, and must assume ANY possible state is valid and happening at once, blurring them together based on how likely each is given the last known observation! Otherwise the next observation could be contradictory to expectations, and seg fault the universe (perhaps just locally). This way though, the universe can always say &quot;well I thought it could have been that&quot; and be correct, even if it only thought it really unlikely.<p>But until the universe interacts with the state then, once coherence [2] sets in only probability can hint at what state it is in. Thus it is random in the before-the-fact sense like the probability before rolling a die, as opposed to an after-the-fact sense like a coin that is already flipped yet hidden.<p>And - here&#x27;s the catch - the math needs to treat it as unknown. To label the parts of an unlabeled system will break the algebra! And if a distribution of states is unknown in a mathematically precise ignorance, this is indistinguishable from true randomness. Such pure conceptual states are rare in our messy universe (at least observationally), but they do exist and can be proven to exist in the same way a one time pad can be proven to be cryptographically secure.<p>Thanks for being my duck, I needed to think about something interesting today!<p>[1] Perhaps the most amazing bit is that if it weren&#x27;t random, then it would act differently, since the distribution of observations would vary from the expected random field after enough observations. And this has been done! Study the double slit experiment deeply, as it really is a fantastic empirical example of why interfering via observation adjusts our interpretation of the results.\n[2]This term is jargon here, like quark colors.

SQL Server instances are being replaced. People are supplanting an enormous amount of computing time that they did on desktops with non-Microsoft tablets and smartphone devices, which is a migration that makes Windows dramatically less entrenched (Office was once the lynchpin of Microsoft&#x27;s maintenance of a captive market, however the need to use a mix of devices has made Office much less palatable than it once was). In other markets, such as online and Home and Entertainment, it has been a decade of losses, and the xbox is being usurped right as Microsoft was supposed to start profiting off of their moves.<p>And as this happens, Microsoft has responded by essentially tapping their existing business customer base to make up for lost market. The prices of some of the new versions are extraordinary (e.g. a Sharepoint 2013 deploy), leading to more departures. It is unsustainable.<p>Microsoft today feels very similar to RIM of 2010 -- the profits are still there, but the industry has moved on.

The lesson here is that you can teach kids about any facet of the computing landscape, and they can catch on quickly and learn a valuable skill.<p>Just because you&#x27;re not getting into low-level hardware interrupts or vector tables or memory addresses, does not mean you &quot;don&#x27;t know how to use&quot; a computer. I&#x27;m glad you have that knowledge, I enjoy stuff like that too.<p>But a lot of kids are &quot;really good at facebook&quot; and use that as inspiration to get into web dev. They want to create the next social network, or the next cool website. Maybe it sparks their interest in big data, or databases, or the math behind social networks.<p>This is just one example. I don&#x27;t particularly care about or use facebook personally. But there are a million different facets to computing.<p>Maybe they end up as a graphic designer for a video game.<p>Maybe they learn they enjoy the machines themselves and build one some day.<p>Maybe they learn they don&#x27;t quite care about computers, and just learn to become literate in an essential tool of the Information Economy.

Helped me set up my BBS when I was a teenager.<p>Mr. Edwards:  6th grade science teacher, leader of the Sour Lake Elementary Model Rocket Club.<p>Uncle Todd:  Showed me my first computer (Apple II), fed me with electronics, bought me my first decent soldering iron.<p>Professer Hahn:  Had the patience to walk me through physics that was way over my head, because he believed I could do it and was so excited about it.  We eventually co-published a paper.<p>Steve Koster:  Web early-bird, ex-boss.  Taught me stuff about design.  Gave me the freedom to hack on cool stuff and get paid for it.<p>All of those people have done infinitely more to inspire me than anyone on your list.  The difference?  They're people that believed in me and acted on that.<p>Could I propose a new rule?  No more fawning over Paul on this site.  It's just kind of yucky.",1207115298

For one practical example, think of fractal compression of images--a series of mathematical equations are synthesized that just happen to best approximate the original image.",1207115168
152829,comment,152753,152821,0,0,bokonist,,,"Simple: every other major currency block is also pursuing a highly inflationary policy.  For instance, the Chinese central bank prints money to buy US bonds.  It does this to keep its own exports strong.  This is a terrible way for China to maximize its standard of living.  But that's not the goal.  The goal of the Chinese government is to maintain strong employment and prevent a second coming of the Taiping rebellion.  If that means subsidizing Joe Sixpack's HDTV, then so be it.",1207114880

As Neal Stephenson stated, they are polished and nice to look at, hence why the prices are jacked up but that is all that they have going for them.  Nowadays, most things that are exuberantly expensive must be worth something and are therefore sought out and it becomes a trend.<p>If your best friend has a $3000 Mac monitor, why shouldn't you have one?<p>In my opinion, Dells are pretty sturdy machines though a bit hefty.

I needed some graphs and figured I'd make myself a right-click-save-as tool. The funnest part was writing the DSL mathematical expression parser. Try, for example:<p><pre><code>   sincosx^2
   -tanlogx^e^x+-1x
   sin1/x^sqrt4

I wanted to implement multiple graphs, polar, and maybe 3D, but it was 1AM I think...Anyone done something similar?",1207113118

152809,comment,152656,152656,0,0,mixmax,,,"Here is a comment I wrote yesterday, which might apply here as well:<p>I think that this is not the kind of thing you learn by reading a book - or sitting in front of a computer. It's a people thing. People have a knack for seeing through other people, whether they believe what they are presenting, like what they do etc.<p>These are the things I would recommend if you want to do a great demonstration:<p>- Love your product - nothing shines through like enthusiasm. Don't be afraid to show it either.<p>- Talk to people, study their reactions, smile to the waitresses, hook up with girls (or guys if that's your preference), start conversations with strangers on the bus. Like in all other walks of life if you practice interacting with people you will become good at it.<p>- Study great speakers when they do their thing - Start by looking at some of Steve Jobs keynotes. The guy is amazing. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama are great at it too.<p>- Be prepared - Do your presentation until your girlfriend starts complaining that you talk in your sleep and she has heard more about you product while you sleep than she has heard about her other girlfriends sexlife. And that's a lot... Steve Jobs recites until everything is absolutely pixel perfect, and every eventuality is covered - and it shows. On their keynotes I heard that they have three independent AV systems. Just in case two of them break down.<p>- Read Dale carnegies ""how to win friends and influence people - it's much better than all the modern crap. It's from the 1930's if my memory serves me correctly.<p>Good luck :-)",1207112980

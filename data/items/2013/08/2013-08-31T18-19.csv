It may have been dogma at the time of COBOL, but now we know plain-English programming <i>general purpose</i> programming languages are a bad idea, because we&#x27;ve tried any number of times, and in general if you <i>don&#x27;t</i> produce an atrocity, you&#x27;re doing well above average. You end up with a language that is still every bit as complex as a normal programming language, <i>and</i> you add the ambiguity of English to the problem.

See also &quot;fully visual programming language&quot; and any number of &quot;business logic&quot; initiatives over the years.<p>(To which the typical next cognitive reaction is to believe that it would work if we just poured more effort into it. That may be true, but it&#x27;s worth pointing out you&#x27;re entering into unprovable territory.

Most people use always the same combination or very simple password, unfortunately the number of hacking attacks are increasing and has become very easy for someone stealing your information and all of your data, moreover, recent attacks are revealing that even complex password are become more and more simple to hack leaving the users no chance to protect in the near future. Moreover, today a person is supposed to deal with at least 100 passwords in his life, how much time is spent to secure and type them?
The problem is that until we don&#x27;t replace the username/password mechanism, users will be more and more careless adopting unsafe methods to generate, store or remind their credentials.<p>Do you feel this problem is actual?

I find it extremely usefull for reasoning, and in general pretty cool to work with. Having all your data in a forward directed graph, including your Ontology (data structure) has some very interesting potentials. When I started with this project 3 years ago, I had to work with SPARQL 1.0 (the query language for triples/RDF), which was a bit troublesome sometimes. But now that SPARQL 1.1 has become a reccomendation, it is becomming well implemented, and working with it maked my queries quite elegant and fun again. Some people say the semantic web has long been dead since guys like google started their own semantic formats. Personally I think that&#x27;s true at all. The vision/potential of the semantic web remains potent as ever. The tools are slowly but surely maturing. The field perhaps seems not <i>that</i> big, but it is surely active and growing. I think in time we&#x27;ll see plenty of semantic web stuff entering the general field, and RDFa may be another helpfull bridge tool along the way.. Though in all honesty, I havn&#x27;t worked with RDFa at all yet, so can&#x27;t say much about that, but will surely have a look at this spec soon.",1377973135

The US has made a conscious decision to not systematically address social issues like homelessness (or lack of healthcare) due to a belief against socialist programs (i.e. we tent to rely on the &quot;free market&quot;). So if programs want this issue solved, you are going to have address this at the <i>national</i> level and maybe support a socialist program (although there may be a free market way of attack this). And if you want to live in place that doesn&#x27;t have this, go to Germany or the Netherlands because there is no place in America that has addressed homelessness (as far as I&#x27;m aware).<p>Funny enough, if you had scrolled a little further down you would see a business insider article talking about a SV exec trying to address this issue: <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/the-jungle-largest-homeless-camp-in-us-2013-8?op=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/the-jungle-largest-homeless-c...</a>.<p>Also if you have Googled a bit, you would have found out San Francisco spends over $200M on homeless issues, making it one of the largest city efforts to address the issue.<p>Please do not rely on link-bait from BusinessInsider to be your primary research source; there&#x27;s a world of knowledge freely available out there through Google & Wikipedia.",1377972937

6307524,comment,6303410,6303410,1,0,stocktradr,,,"Payments: Run a small web firm (among other activities that I do) and I can sympathize with some of your pain points. Recently had client have a month late bill. Nearly put our company under because of the size of the contract and it took the threat of taking the website down to get the payment &quot;expedited&quot;. Working with a large $400mil company, they do have excessive hoops to jump through.<p>Vacation: I can never take a vacation (or that&#x27;s what it feels like). I think this is fairly typical of most startup/contractors since you don&#x27;t get paid if you don&#x27;t work, but I wish it were different. This is probably due to lack of experience which will change over time.<p>Networking: I have some legacy clients that get my team through the months but 100% of our business is repeat or legacy. This is extremely problematic and even though I do a lot of networking, it seems to all for a loss. Finding new clients is definitely the hardest part for me.<p>Hiring/Contracting: Finding good talent in local towns is tough. Always have to do coding review on developers to ensure correct methodology, look at past project experience, etc. The hardest thing to determine (in my opinion) is how hard someone works.<p>As others have stated... finding work = hardest problem. It is a bitch to say the least.",1377972258

And RDFa (lite) is a really easy way of getting in to it. Just make you site indexable using schema.org and RDFa for Google et al is a nice start.<p>I work for UniProt (a databases for biologists) and for us it is really a nice way of providing data to other users to integrate into their own systems. We also provide a sparql endpoint at beta.sparql.uniprot.org for other scientist to run analytical queries without having to deal with running a large datawarehouse of their own (beta.sparql.uniprot.org). i.e upload 5kb of SPARQL queries to us instead of downloading a 100Gb of data them to run SQL in their own systems.<p>These days there are a number of off the self systems that work well enough. Your main danger in the beginning is trying to deal with existing (large) public data before you are ready. The philosophical/reasoning side of the semantic web can also be very confusing but can be ignored in the beginning. Just use RDF as graph data format and SPARQL as a query language and you are good to go.",1377972243
6307522,comment,6302944,6306957,1,0,pkj,,,"Thanks for the comprehensive clarification. Yes you are right that the use of revision-id would allow &quot;first change to reach the server wins&quot; for case (i). It would result in a simple and fair outcome. I did not see the mention of revision usage in the parent link. But it makes absolute sense.<p>Think we agree on case ii). On case iii) I still think that having 1 local and N-1 remote  might be useful when we want to prioritize a particular writer over others. Borrowing the sales example from commenter jchrisa, consider a new user sales-head (local rule). He syncs the data uploaded by his sales folks (remote rule) and then goes offline. When he is done editing and comes online, he wants to make sure his delta takes precedence irrespective of any previous changes by sales folks during his being offline. Since he has local rule, his update will just win. Further, he does not want sales guys who were offline and come online after him to overwrite his last update immediately. I am assuming that the sales folks with &quot;remote&quot; rule will see the data with newer server version and accept it.",1377972213
6307521,comment,6306849,6306849,1,0,xvedejas,,,"Well, there&#x27;s another issue with software patents that causes me to dislike them. At least from the point of view of the free software world, there are often fears that coding some bit of free software will run into a patent that some large company owns and cause problems for that project. It just seems unreasonable from the mindset that you&#x27;re coding something for the benefit of the world that the world will try to prevent you from using that idea  albeit independently formulated. Regardless of whether these patents work for companies, they certainly don&#x27;t work for open source software.",1377972202

Either way, having people live outside is not acceptable, but the solutions we might pursue are very different.<p>If this is local-grown homelessness, it is our responsibility to address it and ensure that people aren&#x27;t reduced to such conditions, regardless of what anyone from the outside contributes to the solution.<p>If transients from across the country (or world) are concentrating here, it doesn&#x27;t reduce the responsibility to address it, but it does mean that it is not our sole responsibility.  The places that are exporting homelessness to us should be liable to help fix it here, otherwise they have a perverse financial incentive to put homeless people on a bus headed in any direction to make it someone else&#x27;s problem.   The more benefits we provide, the stronger the attraction will be to homeless people everywhere, which will only make the problem here more insurmountable.",1377972124

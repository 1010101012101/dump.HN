I'm looking for recommendations either on an external enclosure that supports 3 or 4 drives, or a cheap enclosure that I can by 3 of. Preferably I'd go for the first option unless it is prohibitively expensive.<p>I have heard horror stories about some external enclosures conducting electricity and giving shocks to people if they touch them in the wrong place and other stories of them failing in other less spectacular but still annoying ways. I would like to avoid this by getting something that is good quality.",1242791392

That's a good message!<p>But then it started to sound like bad dating advice from one of those creepy ""Dating 101"" books.  Without genuine interest in making personal connections, the best you can do is temporarily trick people into thinking you care about them.   Effective or not, it's sort of sad.",1242790808

618046,comment,612686,614345,0,0,Alex3917,,,"IIRC though it's actually getting easier to make the best seller list over time. The reason for this is that before Amazon and computers, being on the best seller list meant getting your book on the table in front of the door and next to the cash register in all the bookstores. This is no longer the case, because most books are sold by a handful of chains, and they don't do their laydowns based on the best seller lists but rather based on computer algorithms and deals with publishers. In B&N making the best seller list still gets you a discount and onto a special shelf, but it's still less good than getting onto the front table.<p>Because of this the only people with a big incentive to game the list anymore are people who want to use the credential to use consulting, so there is a lot less competition than there used to be. Of course new authors still try to game the list all the time for ego, but usually they do it half-heartedly so if you really have a permission asset in place and a good strategy its not that hard.",1242790667

(I was often impatient to know how they would end.) But I caught myself doing that and deliberately trained myself to read good prose at a more moderate pace.<p>One thing you really <i>should</i> read aloud is poetry. The art makes a lot more sense when you savor the sounds of the words.  You should also read poetry fairly slowly. Make each word count.

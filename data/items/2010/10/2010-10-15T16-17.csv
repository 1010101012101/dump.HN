Signatures and bottom matter may only be four lines or less. Do not write to this list again until you...."" Irc in my experience can be similar (just a few weeks ago, I had someone barking one-word commands at me on irc, because I was asking a question incorrectly).<p>By contrast, SO is relatively frictionless.

If you strip the color from Google's logo the font isn't as identifiable as Twitter or Facebook (both of which are lowercase) so the combination of colors and capitalization of the first letter makes it stand out. Amazon's logo is all lowercase so I don't know if his example is 100% accurate.<p>The logo I made for Joystickers is all in lowercase precisely because it stands out.

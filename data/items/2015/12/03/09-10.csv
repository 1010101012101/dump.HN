10668772,comment,10662461,10668535,0,0,catnaroek,,,"> This is a classic example of worse-is-better.<p>C won over Lisp, not because “worse is better”, but because the C&#x27;s advantages over Lisp (performance on cheap machines) were more pronounced than the other way around (“safety” achieved by means of lots of runtime checking - by no means was it possible to statically rule out errors). Lispers fancy their language of choice the pinnacle of computer science, but the falsity of this claim becomes evident under close scrutiny.<p>> Go vs. Rust plays out quite similarly to what worse-is-better would predict.<p>I see a brighter future for Rust in the long run, for the following reasons:<p>First, Go doesn&#x27;t do enough for the programmer: Haskell and Erlang are safer and easier to use, and have much better parallelism and concurrency stories. What kind of silly value proposition is “safer than C” or “less verbose than Java”? Rust offers something genuinely new: half-assed attempts at “better C++s” have existed for a while, but “safer C++s” haven&#x27;t.<p>Second, Rust plays much more nicely with other languages. Rust is no more difficult than C to call from, say, Python. On the other hand, Go seems to  be more of an all-or-nothing proposition: “If you want to use Go libraries, use them from applications written in Go.”",1449136559

But if the feedback we see is representative, people care a lot more about not having duplicates.<p>I should add, for anyone who hasn&#x27;t read the post I linked to above, that the original timestamp is always available from the user&#x27;s /submitted list (linked to from their profile) and the /from list for the site (linked to from the domain name in the title line for a story). The relative (re-upped) timestamp is only shown on the front page and the /item page.

My personal preference would be to define all other formal systems in terms of rules of inference.<p>If you are interested in defining &quot;low cognitive load&quot; that&#x27;s a poor choice, in my opinion.<p>>I am fine with any, as long as the same choice is made for all languages being compared. What ultimately interests me is proving a type safety theorem, that is, a precise sense in which “well typed programs don&#x27;t go wrong”, so perhaps this makes a structural operational semantics more appropriate than the other choices.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of any such thing, the kinds of formal semantics that academics prefer deal very poorly with the realities of finite execution speed and memory, the kinds that pratictioners use (which usually isn&#x27;t referred to as &quot;formal semantics&quot; but rather &quot;what does this compile to&quot;) deal very poorly output correctness.<p>However this has little to do with cognitive load, even if such formal semantics existed it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it would be easy for a human mind.<p>> Sure, but the target languages used by most compilers are often themselves very complex. Which means a realistic compiler or interpreter most likely won&#x27;t be a good benchmark for semantic simplicity.<p>If you agree that formal semantics is just a translation from one formalism to another, you can&#x27;t claim that a formalism A is semantically more complex than formalism B without picking a formalism C as a reference point.",1449136227

10668739,comment,10658412,10659142,0,0,comex,,,"Linux package managers and Homebrew don&#x27;t solve it, not even close.  In fact, their fragmentation makes the problem worse.<p>If I write a C library and someone wants to use it in their library or application, they have three choices:<p>1. Add it as a build dependency of their project.  This is a huge pain.<p>- First of all because most build systems are extremely fiddly and poorly designed, so adding the dependency is usually harder than it should be.  For example, because CMake, which everyone seems to be using these days, can&#x27;t produce sensible Visual Studio projects, one project I&#x27;ve worked on maintains separate CMake and Visual Studio build systems - which means that making any moderately complicated changes to the build requires me to either manually edit the VS XML files, send the result to the trybots, and pray it works, or boot a Windows VM.  That&#x27;s just an example; I don&#x27;t know how representative in the sense that other projects also use that dual build hack, but from struggling with CMake, autoconf, and other build systems, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s representative in the sense that build systems will <i>always</i> find some stupid way to break and waste your time.  Awful.  Any alternative is worth consideration.<p>But let&#x27;s say we found an alternative that&#x27;s not a package manager, and ended up with a nice clean system where adding a dependency on a given pkg-config file is just a matter of a few lines and will just work, including for users on weird systems.  Yeah.<p>- Second because the user now has to manually download all the dependencies, and manually upgrade them when they get out of date.  Which means you don&#x27;t want to release too many upgrades, even if you&#x27;re trying to do rapid development.  It&#x27;s nice that this is possible, I guess, but it&#x27;s a real pain.<p>- That is, unless it&#x27;s in their distribution or system package manager of choice.  But going to 10 different Linux distributions, Homebrew, and maybe MacPorts for good measure (and leaving Windows users to rot), and asking each of them nicely to add your library, is not exactly a pleasant experience.  Maybe they will add it themselves if an application depends on it, once your library is actually popular rather than a proof of concept.  (A bit of a chicken and egg situation.)  And then maybe stable Linux users will actually be able to download it in a year or so, but will always be out of date.  Of course, if the project using your library wants to be on its bleeding edge, their developers can&#x27;t do this themselves - they have to go the manual route.<p>This also doesn&#x27;t really work for micro-libraries, which I&#x27;ll elaborate on in a bit.<p>So it&#x27;s not surprising that two other approaches are common:<p>2. &quot;Vendor&quot; your codebase into their codebase, either with something like git-submodule or just by copy and paste.  Typically this requires them to figure out how to build your code with their build system.  Works okay, but is basically just a poor man&#x27;s package manager - it has none of the advantages of the previous method, such as systemwide package tracking and upgrades (either by the system package manager or the user manually remembering to do it!), reduction of fragmentation, etc.; and it is more work to maintain.<p>3. Don&#x27;t bother with your library at all; just reimplement whatever they want themselves (in a poorer fashion).<p>It&#x27;s hard to quantify how much this happens, but in my experience, C++ projects do seem to have a bias toward building up little piles of basic utilities rather than reaching for a library.  At the other extreme would be node.js and NPM - this post, as well as a Debian thread from a few months ago it belongs to, containing much handwringing about how to fit it into their system, is a good read:<p><a href=""https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2015/08/msg00603.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2015/08/msg00603.html</a><p>(Spoiler: It&#x27;s the build dependency graph for building jQuery, which contains some 491 entries, although it lists packages multiple times when they are referenced by multiple dependencies.)<p>Some NPM packages are literally 5 lines of code.  Arguably still better than copy and paste... maybe...<p>I don&#x27;t think C/C++ need to go there; most languages with package managers don&#x27;t.  But it&#x27;s a good example of how the presence of packaging tools, as internalized into a programming language&#x27;s culture, significantly changes the way people write code in those languages.  And I think C/C++ could be a lot more pleasant if it were easier to reach for utilities outside of the standard library.  (Especially pure C, which lacks an equivalent of the STL in its standard library - while the language may prevent writing data structures as neatly as in C++, you can still express some generalized high level structures pretty well and efficiently; and I think the standard library is partly to blame for the fact that people usually don&#x27;t, instead building half-assed special-purpose data structure implementations every time one is required.)<p>...<p>I know, the idea of having a different package manager for every language sounds awful.  It <i>is</i> awful, both for the user who needs to remember how each one works, and for the developer who&#x27;s screwed if they want to depend on something written in a different language.  I&#x27;d be quite interested in the idea of building something that feels like a language package manager, but is actually just Nix or something with some useful defaults...<p>But I&#x27;m starting to be convinced that having nothing at all is worse.<p>You allude to the complexity of C builds.  While real, a huge fraction of this is not caused by any inherent difference between C and interpreted languages, but simply the diversity and general mess of C build systems.  (Of course, some low level programs really do require complex build processes, and those programs are more likely to be written in C than Ruby, but those are the minority.)<p>And this is something a package manager can significantly, simply by providing less flexibility and therefore more standardization.  Ideally, if you can build one package from the package manager, you can build &#x27;em all.<p>Somewhat belated disclaimer: I haven&#x27;t given conan.io more than a quick look, so I don&#x27;t know how well it actually solves any of the preceding, heh.  But I&#x27;ve wanted to see a good C package manager for a while, and I fully intend to check this one out when I have the chance.",1449136057

We inherited some infrastructure legacy from LXDE, which was hosted on sourceforge. Today, we have moved most of the legacy to Github but we&#x27;re still using Sourceforge&#x27;s mailing list system.<p>We&#x27;re moving to a self-hosted mailman3 instance but it&#x27;s been excruciatingly painful.

My personal preference would be to define all other formal systems in terms of rules of inference.<p>> It&#x27;s rather obvious that choosing the target formalism determines how simple the language will appear, when you talk about &quot;formal semantics&quot; you should specify &quot;which one&quot;: operational? denotational? axiomatic?<p>I am fine with any, as long as the same choice is made for all languages being compared. What ultimately interests me is proving a type safety theorem, that is, a precise sense in which “well typed programs don&#x27;t go wrong”, so perhaps this makes a structural operational semantics more appropriate than the other choices.<p>> Stricly speaking a compiler or an interpreter represents a formal semantics for a language: operational semanthics rules are often very very similar to the code of an AST interpreter, for example.<p>> One could interpreter your statement to mean that the smaller the compiler the simpler the language, which means that assembly language was the simplest language all along!<p>Sure, but the target languages used by most compilers are often themselves very complex.

Most people believe in their product, that&#x27;s why they develop it and invest the long hours in the first place. However, you&#x27;re only one person, and until that product sees the light of day and you get real feedback, you&#x27;re living in a bubble.<p>I did the same thing once, and then never again. I developed a product for a year in my free time. Everything was finished, polished, all the features were fully developed, and it was ready to go. What happened? I &#x27;launched&#x27;, a handful of users registered, there were a dozen posts, and that was it. Only in that moment, did I realize it wasn&#x27;t that great of an idea in the first place, and how absurd it was to invest a year of my time before getting feedback from my target audience.<p>What I do now is try to launch asap. I get a rough concept up and running, and launch in a weekend, a week, or a month. I developed one site over the course of 48 hours (from idea to working beta), launched, and it had 2,000 registered users in less than a day. It still failed a year later. I launched another site after a month of development, and that one had 3,000 users the first day, and now it has a million and continues to grow.<p>By not launching, you&#x27;re wasting time.

That&#x27;s why you should launch asap. If you invest a few weeks, and it fails, that&#x27;s great, you proved the idea doesn&#x27;t work, and you move onto the next. You can launch a dozen products and services in a year this way, identify the failures, and when one appears to gain traction, then you can flesh it out more. I don&#x27;t think my site had a FAQ until it had 25k+ users, a support section until it had 50k+ users. It didn&#x27;t get a ToS until it had 500k+ users.

This makes it easier to compose software, and in particular to reuse software like libraries (that frequently end up as layers between one component and another). For a concrete example, in a Java program I can simply publish an event into a Guava EventBus [1] without worrying where it will end up at the time I write that code. There&#x27;s no real risk that I&#x27;ll end up with a memory leak. I can connect two things together that weren&#x27;t designed to be used together, and I can do it while inserting intermediate layers that transform, copy, record, measure, that data.<p>Garbage collection significantly reduces the amount of coordination necessary between unrelated parts of the code base, thereby improving code reuse. This is what I would claim is less commonly recognized win, beyond the more commonly recognized wins from eliminating classes of obvious mistakes. EventBus is just one random example that involves plugging things together - the same effect is present all over Java libraries, from logging frameworks to collections to concurrent data structures.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained</a>",1449133343

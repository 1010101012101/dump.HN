People barely pay attention because they're located in Tampa and don't brag about it all the time - like other subscription based revenue companies we often hear from.<p>What's worth noting is if a big company (99% of them anyway) tried to copy off of WuFoo they'd seem so disingenuous and fake they'd fail.

But hey, their guess is as good as the ""pros"" at this point.<p>What I don't like is people pretending it's anything but a wild guess.<p>You're right that the discussion of how the downturn will affect software and open source is better.  That's because it's something Nat clearly knows a great deal about.  He should have stuck with that.",1223448419

If there is a third party that both of you trust perhaps you can have a three way conversation where you focus on the current situation and the best way forward that's fair to everyone. The key is to focus on ""going forward from where you are."" That's the challenge you are faced with. Why do you need to buy him out completely? Are you going to need him to help new employees get up to speed? Find a way to keep the conversation going and reach an amicable solution.",1223446408

It was probably too short to be meaningful.<p>What I meant that this can be good because it can show to people the ""human side"" if you like to open source. I see many people think Linux is only for slightly crazy fanatics and I believe that LT can do a much better job at representing the diverse movement than RMS and ESR (don't get me wrong I kinda like both of them).<p>On the other hand LT can be a bit insensitive and turn people off (do you remember that GNOME controversy?)",1223445741

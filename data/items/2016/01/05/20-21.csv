In July 2015, we suffered a compromise at PagerDuty via the Linode Manager. I hope that we can provide a bit more of an official in-depth post-mortem of our compromise, but I&#x27;d be happy to disclose some of the details here.<p>Using the access gained within the Linode Manager, the attacker reset the root password on a few systems, and used Lish to gain root access. We were alerted to this activity and fully revoked the attacker&#x27;s access within 60 minutes of the first node being compromised. Working with Linode support, we discovered which user account was being used and completely deactivated the user. We also isolated the VMs, and performed forensics on read-only copies of their disk images.<p>In our situation the attacker knew one of our user&#x27;s passwords and MFA secret. This allowed them to provide valid authentication credentials for an account in the Linode Manager. It&#x27;s worth noting that all of our active user accounts had two-factor authentication enabled. An interesting data point was that the user who had their account compromised was no longer in possession of the MFA secret themselves. Their cell phone had been reset (thus deleting all data) 8 months prior. The user could not log in to the Linode Manager if they wanted, so it was our determination that the key could not have been obtained from the user and was more likely on Linode&#x27;s side.<p>We also have evidence from access logs provided by Linode that the attackers tried to authenticate as an ex-employee, whose username ONLY existed in the Linode database. It was absolutely unique and was not used elsewhere by the employee making the username an accidental honeypot. This was another piece of data supporting that Linode was the source of our compromise.<p>We immediately reached out to them not only to inform them of their compromise, but to assist them in investigating it. We were confident that the Linode database had been breached, and that the secret key used to encrypt information in the database had been compromised as well.<p>In addition to reaching out to Linode, we also worked with a third-party security firm to audit our work done during the incident. Likewise, around the same time we reached out to law enforcement to assist in investigating the attack. I believe our public disclosure includes this information[1]. This was in the middle of July 2015.<p>We did not get confirmation in July that there was a breach of the Linode Manager or any associated credentials.<p>In the end, we migrated away from Linode because of this breach (even before it was publicly disclosed) in Aug 2015. We also never were able to confidently disclose that Linode was the vector due to lack of confirmation from their end. While all of us who responded to the incident were confident they were the source, we now thankfully have the data to confirm it.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/july-2015-security-announcement/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/july-2015-security-announceme...</a>",1452027582

But what do they have in common? In a word: popularity. The core reason these sites are targeted is because it is impressive to others.<p>The source of this is typically two fold:<p>- For the lolz. Someone with a botnet just wants to show off, taking down something known gives them more notoriety.<p>- For a sales pitch. Someone has botnet capacity that they want to sell, and &quot;I took down Linode&quot; is a great way of demoing that to potential buyers.<p>The first one is more common when someone finds a new method of traffic multiplication and just wants to show it off (i.e. they trick a third party into DoS/DDoSing a target). The second one is legitimate criminal enterprises.",1452027564

I&#x27;m just saying that off the bat binary-tree traversal don&#x27;t really test my understanding of the data structure. Recently in an interview I was asked a problem which eventually required using a binary-search-tree to improve the running time. This, I believe, is the right way to test but it requires the employer to spend more time designing interview questions rather than relying on a problem bank[0]. (which is a strong filter for good companies in itself)<p>> But they completely ignore the other 80% of the job which is design, soft skills, estimates, timelines, code reviews etc...<p>This is true but this is really really hard to test. In the interviews that I&#x27;ve been giving, I&#x27;ve indeed been asked design questions. I assume soft skills are implicitly tested while speaking to the interviewer (to some extent, at least). But other factors, AFAIK are very hard to test. Also, I would argue that a candidate doesn&#x27;t need to know everything coming in. Estimates, timelines etc can be learnt on the job.<p>IMO, if somehow employers could find a way to reasonably trust that the code I have on my Github is indeed written by me then I think that should be strong indicator of my competence. Evaluating candidates who don&#x27;t have any code in the open is a different matter altogether to which I have no solution.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://leetcode.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://leetcode.com</a>",1452027534

If I have no say in the structure or management of the company, it&#x27;s a huge risk.<p>As we&#x27;ve seen with Bitcoin, it&#x27;s too easy for hackers to manipulate a technology that 90% of the population will never understand.<p>&quot;In general, this reality leads to a co-operative reality where more people are working as named agents with skin in the game.&quot;<p>It has to be proportional to risk, however.  Most of the people I know will not risk debt for a possible return 5 years in the future.  They would rather just work a regular job and get paid for it.<p>&quot;What have I accomplished on a world scale?&quot;<p>It&#x27;s risk vs. reward.  If you make a million dollars on the stock market, you most likely risked a good portion of income to do it.<p>Not only that, but the company has benefited from the transaction. What if it means a company that builds artificial hearts can now go into full production?<p>You could have just as easily lost a million dollars, but nobody is rallying to get your money back.<p>&quot;No new real capital was produced.&quot;<p>If we are going to go with this line of thinking, 99.9% of all the startups PG funded should never have even been started.  Nothing is ground-breaking nor will it save lives or change the world as we know it.<p>&quot;I can now sit on my million dollars for as long as I would like and my only threat is uncontrolled inflation.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s pretty foolish to just sit on a million dollars without investing it in something.  You are leaving money on the table and lose a portion of it due to inflation every year.  Inflation is always happening and anyone with money knows this.  So &#x27;sitting on money&#x27; is really a non-issue.<p>&quot;We place a burden on those that win. Use your winnings to produce real capital or it will go back to those that provided it in the first place.&quot;<p>Why stop at money?  What if we said something like: Use your free time for something productive or you will be forced to work for the government.  You could be doing something that will save the world, but instead, you are smoking weed and playing video games.<p>I find that there is this sentiment lately that we need to punish the rich for their success...mostly by people that have not yet achieved it.  When something you covet gets taken away by force for the &#x27;good of the people&#x27;, you will be singing a different tune.<p>&quot;But if buying a Tesla also produced future dividends based on how successful Tesla ended up being in the future, I might take on this much-reduced risk&quot;<p>So if I buy a Tesla and get a % of the profits?  How will this be beneficial to anyone if they get a 10 cent check every month when 30 million people also bought the same product?<p>The ideas presented here just don&#x27;t seem to be better or more efficient than our current system.",1452027531

I used to work at a very large microprocessor manufacturer and before they &quot;compressed&quot; the cubicles, the cubicles were 9x9.  Someone had to physically come <i>into</i> your cubicle to get your attention (or pop their head over the wall, but only 6-foot+ people could do that).  To deal with disturbances, we actually had &quot;DO NOT DISTURB&quot; signs assigned to us which we could hang across the cubicle entrance to keep people from bothering us.  These signs were frequently used, and to very good effect.<p>Personally, I wish I could go back to that environment.  It was the best of both worlds when I had this nice-sized cube with privacy, but was also seated next to a coworker I frequently needed to collaborate with.

Hashing only slows down an attack (and or increases the cost), it doesn&#x27;t not mitigate one. In particular if the hashes aren&#x27;t salted then a rainbow table is an extremely effective way of breaking all of the hashes concurrently.<p>The main method of doing so: Generate the hash for every combination of typable characters up to a given length (e.g. MD5() A-Za-z0-9 & specials up to 8x characters).<p>This can be mitigated using a more computationally expensive hashing routine (or increasing the work factor on a less computationally expensive one) and salts.<p>But given enough time OR computing power, all hashes will be broken.

But every good architect that I know was also a good programmer.  They might or might not actually spend much time programming, but they clearly could do it.<p>My understanding of the reason is that a good architect needs to be able to mentally connect every level from abstract architecture down to actual code.  If you can&#x27;t, then you&#x27;ll eventually absorb ideas that sound good but don&#x27;t really work in practice.

I can imagine productivity at an assembly line job having a peak such that overworking grinds someone down to the point that they become a liability, but people that claim working nine hours in a day instead of eight gives no (or negative) additional benefit are either being disingenuous or just have terrible work habits.  Even in menial jobs, it is sort of insulting – “Hey you, working three jobs to feed your family! Half of the time you are working is actually of negative value so you don’t deserve to be paid for it!”<p>If you only have seven good hours a day in you, does that mean the rest of the day that you spend with your family, reading, exercising at the gym, or whatever other virtuous activity you would be spending your time on, are all done poorly?  No, it just means that focusing on a single thing for an extended period of time is challenging.<p>Whatever the grand strategy for success is, it gets broken down into lots of smaller tasks.  When you hit a wall on one task, you could say “that’s it, I’m done for the day” and head home, or you could switch over to something else that has a different rhythm and get more accomplished.  Even when you are clearly not at your peak, there is always plenty to do that doesn’t require your best, and it would actually be a waste to spend your best time on it.  You can also “go to the gym” for your work by studying, exploring, and experimenting, spending more hours in service to the goal.<p>I think most people excited by these articles are confusing not being aligned with their job’s goals with questions of effectiveness.  If you don’t want to work, and don’t really care about your work, less hours for the same pay sounds great!  If you personally care about what you are doing, you don’t stop at 40 hours a week because you think it is optimal for the work, but rather because you are balancing it against something else that you find equally important.  Which is fine.<p>Given two equally talented people, the one that pursues a goal obsessively, for well over 40 hours a week, is going to achieve more.  They might be less happy and healthy, but I’m not even sure about that.  Obsession can be rather fulfilling, although probably not across an entire lifetime.<p>This particular article does touch on a goal that isn’t usually explicitly stated: it would make the world “less unequal” if everyone was prevented from working longer hours.  Yes, it would, but I am deeply appalled at the thought of trading away individual freedom of action and additional value in the world for that goal.",1452026156

You can&#x27;t really have conflict free changes, that are consistent across values to boot, across distributed nodes unless you:\na) are synchronous in some way (e.g. distributed locks) - which you don&#x27;t really want in a geographically distributed system because of the heavy latency impact\nor\nb) partition your data in a way that doesn&#x27;t requir any changes to span nodes.<p>In many scenarios these restrictions are unacceptable, and dealing with potential inconsistencies is the smaller (but y no means small) evil.  If you indeed need it, you need to design your spoliation accordingly.<p>There are workloads where it&#x27;s easy to deal with such problems.

In expensive areas, parking will be expensive or nonexistent (since it is likely dense and the need for parking is small) and in cheap areas it will be cheap or free.<p>Also, many city dwellers do not drive or drive rarely, so to them free parking is mostly wasted space and potentially even actively harmful to their interests. Manhattanites would likely rather have wider sidewalks than street parking since the sidewalks are so crowded, but no one asked them. We even made the sidewalks smaller than they originally were to move more cars, despite walking moving vastly more people on Manhattan streets. We reduced the capacity of moving <i>people</i> to move more <i>cars</i>, something that directly harms city residents in various ways.<p>>I agree though that parking downtown should be expensive (or at least reflect the actual cost of providing it). You have to be careful about unintended consequences though.<p>The pricing mechanism acts as a way to ration parking spaces, and if the cost is too low all the spots will be taken. If it&#x27;s too high, no one will use it since it&#x27;s too expensive. You don&#x27;t want to price at cost. You want there to always be a couple spaces open. If you run out of parking, people will circle the block.<p>The best on street parking system would be a dynamic system that takes into account demand so prices vary throughout the day or the week. This way some spots can always be open and the current &#x27;circle the block&#x27; problem goes away. It would also take into account special events and holidays. Many cities don&#x27;t do that and only charge some extremely small parking fee.<p>>I can imagine a future where parking is so expensive that shoppers just tell their car to circle the block while they shop.<p>Some cities, such as London and Singapore, have congestion pricing. This is to make drivers pay for the externality of congestion, something that gas taxes and the like don&#x27;t currently pay for. With congestion pricing, circling the block could also be costly.",1452026057

It&#x27;s just the nature of the industry. Also[1]:<p>> The company says that they’re doing 150 xenografts a day (!) But their rationale is that trying to culture CSCs in vitro runs the risk of having them change character too much, making any assays using them unreliable. My guess is that they’re right about that, but my worry is that xenograft tumors themselves are already unreliable enough to cause trouble (and I have no idea of what happens to them after you “passage” them through multiple animals). Xenograft models are, of course, well known in oncology drug discovery, but one of the things that’s well known about them is that they’re the pure example of “necessary but nowhere near sufficient”. If your drug fails in a xenograft, it will probably fail in the clinic. But if your drug works in a xenograft, it will probably fail in the clinic, too. The odds get better, but they go from “extremely likely not to work” to “pretty likely not to work”, and you take what you can get in this business.<p>> So how’s Stemcentrx doing in their cell hunt? They’re not going to tell Technology Review, naturally, but as the article mentions, the entire CSC hypothesis has been taking some hits recently. It’s still very much an open question. How many tumor types are driven by stem cells, whether they can be targeted (and how), how to tell when such an approach is indicated at all – there are a lot of open questions. It seems very likely that there are cell types inside a given tumor population that are more aggressive and likely to spread, but whether that narrows down to a particular stem cell group, I don’t know. What if there are 234 cell types in some particular tumor, and (say) fourteen of them are the ones to really worry about? What then? Will there be a common mechanism to target these, or not?<p>0: <a href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/09/28/verastem-shares-plunge-after-company-halts-cancer-drug-trial/trHendPQ0ewSqLm2pixltJ/story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/09/28/verastem-sha...</a><p>1: <a href=""http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/09/09/chasing-cancer-stem-cells"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/09/09/cha...</a>",1452025744

In Spanner, what are the properties of the underlying storage system, Collosus?).\nI would love to see all distributed systems papers be able to reproduce everything by just downloading a file that allows the paper&#x27;s results to be reproduced. We can do it with the help of either virtualization or containers and software configuration frameworks (to parameterize the experiments). We can specify the hardware and network programmatically, we can install the software automatically, we can parameterize system software (with Chef or Puppet attributes), and run the experiments reproducibly. Without huge investment and cloud computing or Docker, we could specify systems that have reproducible hardware/network/software. \nThe first attempt I&#x27;ve seen at this is www.karamel.io that allows you to design reproducible experiments by using JClouds to spawn VMs and setup the virtualized hardware, then orhcestrating Chef to install software that can be parameterized. I hope to see more of this line of platform gain adoption in our community. It would be a boon for research.",1452025633

When Emergency Access is activated, each user has a pair of cryptographic keys – a public key to allow others to encrypt data for the user, and a private key that allows the user to decrypt the data that others have encrypted for them.</i><p><i>The key used to encrypt and decrypt your vault data is encrypted with the Emergency Access contact’s public key, and can be decrypted only with their corresponding private key. When setting up Emergency Access, you are using the recipient’s public key, encrypting your vault key with that public key, and then LastPass stores that RSA-2048 encrypted data until it’s released after the waiting period you specify. Only the recipient can decrypt the data, so no one else can decrypt it without access to the private key of the recipient you’re sharing it with, which is encrypted with their master password key. This process is completely automated, with no action required by the end user, and ensures that the data is inaccessible by LastPass or outside parties.</i><p>Basically, it sounds like LastPass has each client generate a keypair, store the private key in the vault, and give the public key to LastPass for distribution.

Perhaps a range or actually a normal distribution to represent a prior with uncertainty?<p>Almost everyone does this, and the solution is a posterior probability distribution. Most uses of Bayesian techniques that I&#x27;m familiar with are based on Monte Carlo simulations, where priors are drawn from the specified prior distribution, processed in some fashion, and result in samples of the posterior distribution.<p>This is especially helpful when you don&#x27;t view the problem as having a &#x27;true&#x27; single answer with some &#x27;uncertainty&#x27; but instead have actual variability in the system, which is described by the posterior distribution.<p>Thinking about it, I&#x27;m really not sure in what instance the prior wouldn&#x27;t be a distribution.  It is, by definition, a probability.  I suppose you could have a singular value, where the pdf is a delta function, but what&#x27;s the point of doing the Bayesian inversion or estimation then?  If you have a single value with prior p(x) = 0 or 1, you should end up with the posterior p(x|d)=0 or 1.<p>So the simplest case is where the prior is a binary:  Say p(x=yes) = 0.6, p(x=no)=0.4.  Or something like that.  It&#x27;s not a <i>continuous</i> distribution but it&#x27;s still a distribution.  The sum/integral of all cases has to be 1.",1452025086

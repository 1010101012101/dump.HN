8093925,comment,8092967,8092967,2,0,krapp,,,"You can pick up the syntax of JSON, INI and YAML in a couple of minutes - which is how it should be. Because all you should be doing with a config file is assigning values to variables or defining the attributes of a structure - and preferably, those values should be primitives. To me, &quot;Turing complete configuration&quot; is a contradiction in terms, or at least it should be considered such. Almost everything the author lists as an advantage of using a programming language <i>shouldn&#x27;t be done with configuration anyway.</i><p>One of the reasons I like PHP is that INI and JSON parsing come out of the box, so no need to worry about whether or not a packaged parser is compliant. This is also one of the reasons why I avoid YAML even though it&#x27;s more flexible - if a configuration format isn&#x27;t supported natively by the language you&#x27;re using then I would agree it&#x27;s probably an unnecessary layer of abstraction. But I don&#x27;t see how the c example provided is <i>much</i> better than the .conf file, although it does possibly demonstrate that the config file format itself should be a bit less opaque. At least I can expect that a simple config file couldn&#x27;t eventually explode in algorithmic complexity into its own bloated universe of code.<p>Keep it simple. Keep it stupid. You&#x27;ll be thankful a few years down the road when the inevitable feature creep hasn&#x27;t caused your config workflow to explode into its own self-contained application with its own dependencies and peculiarities.",1406494039

I&#x27;ll bet that right now any kind of sonic scan would be crude and rough - but how long before signal processing can be cleaned up to make it good enough to guesstimate the lengths of the pin segments?<p>Especially if the scan included analyzing against known lock types? This is the sort of problem for which the Internet is ideal: An optical scan to narrow down lock makers and models, load custom signal processing configurations for those likely locks, perform a sonic scan of the lock and collect reflections, distortions, etc., and use the custom config to ease the decoding: Wah-la! A picture of the inside of the lock, with pin segment lengths.<p>Then print 5-10 likely keys on the spot.<p>Picking a lock requires a suspicious body posture and special tools.<p>Scanning a lock this way just requires you be close enough to the door. Checking your messages? Patting your pockets to make sure you have everything? Leaning your bag against the door on your knee to make sure you have everything? Many plausible scenarios for staying close enough long enough, and the tools are COTS, common.<p>Or maybe I &quot;deliver&quot; a &quot;package&quot; to your door, lean it against the door (UPS and others do this all the time), and the top of the package contains the scanning tools. I come back later (seconds, minutes?) after realizing I&#x27;ve made a mistake and take the package back.<p>The more I think about it, the more I cannot help but wonder if the physical lock of the future will not need a proof-of-authorization mechanism to vet the keyholder - at which point we eliminate the keyhole entirely and move to direct identification of authorized entrants.<p>And then of course watch for 0-day vulnerabilities in THAT technology.",1406493208

I know of instances where tax authorities have simply seized accounts on their own authority without sanction from a count. I know of instances where real estate has been seized on the mere suspicion of Marijuana growing. Yes, due process is available to remedy such wrongs... by suing in court for relief. Good luck with that if you have no liquid funds to hire a lawyer. And your bank is foreclosing because you can&#x27;t pay the mortgage.<p>More and more, KYC means asking permission to spend your own money. Putting all payment processing into the hands of a few middlemen is a dangerous concentration of power.<p>It&#x27;s sad that we make retailers eat a 3% gross tax on transactions in exchange for bullshit rewards. In the end merchants just bill the costs right back to us anyway. Individually we feel like we&#x27;re doing well. We get flights or 1% cash back.

The upside of this is that it makes a variety of financial firms (banks and credit card companies) quite interested in issuing them. For instance, some banks will offer no-fee bank accounts with direct deposit and a certain minimum number of monthly check-card purchases (in lieu of requiring larger minimum balances). Some providers will also explicitly send a significant fraction of these fees right back to the customer as &quot;cash back&quot;, airline-miles, or similar rewards.<p>(The downside is obvious. The dynamics of the interplay are interesting. I wonder if there are any good studies.)",1406491386

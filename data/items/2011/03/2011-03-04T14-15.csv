More than other teachers, I got the feeling that he genuinely cared about everyone succeeding: he ran multiple early morning study sessions several times a week, and didn't slouch this duty off to his TAs but was there himself, from 7am until the lectures started at 10. Not to say that my other teachers didn't also care, but he really put the time in to show it. I was always impressed because this was just a sophomore undergrad class, and I'm sure he had ""more important"" things to do.",1299250777

Ideally it takes 40-60 minutes, five times a week, plus an extra long session of over 90 minutes.  This is about the minimum training you'll see in a 5k runner or 1000m swimmer.  Top 10k runners generally require 70-90 minutes a day, even when doing interval work and have long runs of over two hours.  The results of this sort of training are measurable.

Sound of a jackhammer at 1m has sound pressure level of approximately 100dB (relative to 20 uPa). Leaves rustling gently in the wind have sound pressure level about 10dB. If our hearing actually had 120dB dynamic range we'd be able to easily hear the rustling of the leaves while jackhammer is pounding right next to us, not to speak of normal conversation which roughly has level of 50-60dB.<p>As an analogy to radio equipment we might say that human ears have automatic gain control which spans 120dB (or as audio comparison we can adjust the volume on that span) but the range which we can discern two sources (the instantaneous dynamic range) is about 30dB or less.<p>Also about the frequency resolution of the ear vs the eyes the bandwidth are on a completely different scale. Visible light spans about 380THz which means that the bandwidth of that signal is 19 250 000 000 times the bandwidth spanned by our ears. You cannot do just simple octave based comparison as the amount of information is not dependent on the amount of octaves but only on bandwidth. You are correct in the sense that the eye uses this information in quite limited fashion, however the actual processing is not on normal frequency domain but on spatial domain (eye is not just one sensor but craploads of them).",1299248267

It took me a month to get a quote, 3 months to get an order, and by then the project was cancelled so we didn't buy.<p>I was astonished. Nothing wrong with upselling - but here I was, a guy who LIKED sun gear, with cash ready to go, and a product list, the easiest sale in the world - not that big, and for some reason sun had to get all involved and screw themselves out of the sale.<p>When someone comes to you knowing exactly what they want, ready to pay, SHIP IT TO THEM!<p>It's no surprise they failed.",1299248025

Does the hour of pickup soccer I played last night count? (A pretty intense hour of sprinting) To me, yes. To others maybe walking the dog with a brief jog to the door from the end of the driveway is as intense as it gets. I would argue that ""walking the dog"" doesn't cut it if that is your ""sometimes with intensity"" definition.<p>Every person needs to squat and deadlift heavy things from time to time. And that does not need to happen in a gym -- a good sized rock suffices. Doing so will help with mobility, bone density, strength and balance. And if those movements cause injury then they need to fix the disfuctions that aren't allowing proper movement. Not addressing those issues will lead to hip, should and back problems down the line whether they lift or not.",1299247612

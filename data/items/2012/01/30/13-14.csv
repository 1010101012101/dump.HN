3528779,comment,3528144,3528728,12,0,danieldk,,,"First, grep requires specify intermediate characters. For instance, to match SublimeText, you need the regular expression 'S.*B', while in Sublime you could just type 'SB'. (Neither is better, they just serve different purposes.)<p>Second, grep is not comparable, it's a different tool. For instance, if you would want to open the openCorpus function in the file MainWindow.cpp, in Sublime you'd just type ""MWcp@opC"", and you are there. While typing the pane and window dynamically update, allowing you to narrow down the 'search space' quickly.<p>Grep is for searching for text strings in files in the shell or shell scripts. Sublime's Goto Anything is for searching files and symbols in a text editor.<p>Edit: I like and use both vim and ST2, but neither grep, ctags, nor Peepopen provide the smooth experience of 'Goto Anything'. Of course, conversely vim also has many things to like over ST2 (such as modeful editing that is definitely better than ST2's Vintage).",1327931975

I will answer what I can without searching, just for the fun of it. Also, I just woke up. Feedback would be greatly appreciated.<p>1) Iframe over XHR. Not quite sure. I have used iframes to load a print version of a page and print it without redirecting the user. Other than that, perhaps I would also use frames to get a fully rendered response from the server and just append the html to the existing dom (so as to keep XHR for data only responses). Or load a bunch of templates. Or just use iframes for what they really are, embedding other webpages into the existing one.<p>2) One method that looks bullet-proof is what olark has done: <a href=""https://github.com/olark/lightningjs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/olark/lightningjs</a> Takes care of xhtml vs html, bad code, bad browsers and lots of other stuff (performance).<p>3) Yes I can. Years ago I used while() and was excited to find out that it's actually a good solution. I wouldn't load a library when it would make the experience less better.<p>4) I would guess dom manipulation, append, insert and the like. I always remove the parent element and then put it back in when I'm done with it. innerHTML is also fast and appropriate sometimes.<p>5) I can't understand the problem/question. Can you elaborate?<p>6) Off the top of my head: input, br, hr, meta, link, img. Omitted entirely? Not sure but I would say body and html. I would search and choose one of the top results. If its stackoverflow, w3c specs, htmldog I wouldn't worry.<p>7) Use location.hash. I wouldn't know how to implement it my self (IE needs an iframe from what I understand, Safari has/ad its own issues) but there are a bunch of libraries out there to do it for me. HTML5 has pushState, yay!<p>8) Good question. Considering only HTML and CSS I would use CSS colours (but not background-image, that was fixed).

Introversion does not necessarily imply social awkwardness, nerdiness, or even shyness, per se. Rather, to be introverted is simply to prefer fewer or smaller social activities -- not out of a sense of being unable to handle such things, but out of a general preference for less social stimulation.<p>Popular (mis)usage, especially in the US, presents introverts as somehow flawed or unwhole, while extroverts are properly adjusted -- as if the standard is set by the extroverts, and everyone who falls short of that mark lands somewhere on the Autism spectrum. (It's reached the point where many people these days are afraid even to describe themselves as ""introverted,"" lest others assume they're somehow damaged).<p>It's time to do away with such nonsense.",1327928455

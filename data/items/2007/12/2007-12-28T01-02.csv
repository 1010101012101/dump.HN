As a result, elected officials' positions on science and technology issues do not get the attention and energy from policymakers that they deserve.<p>SEA has developed a system through which elected officials' positions on these and other important science policy issues can be easily tracked and presented.This is a first of its kind organizing tool that engages citizens in science and technology issues and helps them hold their elected officials accountable.<p>By bringing these elements together and allowing users to contribute information to the site, SEA will enable the electorate to more fully evaluate their elected representatives, allow individual members to share information on elected officials, and ultimately provide a forum for elected officials to communicate with their constituents on their science policy positions.",1198806749

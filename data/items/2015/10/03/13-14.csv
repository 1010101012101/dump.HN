We all have our unique genetic advantages and disadvantages, but there shouldn&#x27;t be social disadvantage based on genetics.  It is good we are taught this, because it requires social change.<p>Also to answer your points directly, they do not at all suggest races are not equal.  &quot;Asian&quot; isn&#x27;t a race, and &quot;Working harder&quot; is a cultural/social quality not a genetic quality.  Same with black people dominating basketball, could just as easily be explained with social qualities rather than genetic. Really you have presented weak hypothesises in the form of rhetorical questions.<p>Otherwise, by your same reasoning: White men people are genetically superior at leading, running companies, space travel, research, etc...

Fairness is always &quot;derived from&quot; unfairness. The pie wasn&#x27;t divided equally? Then the fair thing to do is to unfairly take pie from the people who were rightly given their larger share. It&#x27;s theirs, right? They were given it. They played by the rules, and now we want to take pie from some and give it to others? Fairness is only possible when one transcends exactly that line of reasoning.<p>> If the level of access to primary and secondary education is highly unequal then why not fix that first?<p>The <i>most</i> naive thing about that remark is that it&#x27;s precluded by your first remark. The <i>second most</i> naive thing about it is that the way in which this inequality of access works, and the ways in which it can be remedied, should embarrass any speaker who asks &quot;...why not fix that...?&quot; Civil liberties? Just fix it. Traumatic and total devastation of an extant cultural support system by colonization? Just fix it. Centuries of ensuing racism, ethnocentrism, and bigotry reinforcing an association--in both the dominant cultural and economic systems <i>and</i> in the minds of the members of an outgroup--between a race or ethnicity and social unfitness and undesirability?

Before I started on this research, I had never heard of edge-notched cards, much less appreciated coding schemes that minimize the number of manual needle insertions needed to search a deck.<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to understand why superimposed coding systems did not reach the modern world. The principles behind it really helped me understand how some modern techniques work, but those modern techniques are ad hoc. Already by 1974 superimposed coding was considered an &#x27;old technique.&#x27; I quote from &quot;The Large Data Base File Structure Dilemma&quot;, <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ci60001a005"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ci60001a005</a> :<p>> The second solution to the dilemma, suggested in Figure 7, is sequential search. This may appear to be a throwback, particularly within the framework of on-line systems, but it should be noted that the speed of the CPU combined with the extremely high data transfer rate from secondary storage of third and fourth generation computers has reached a point where one might profitably reexamine the potential of sequential processing.<p>I interpret this and similar articles to mean that the older techniques weren&#x27;t a good fit for the then-current computer architectures. After two generations of disuse, institutional memory fades. And reading the old literature doesn&#x27;t help if you read it through the eyes of people with 1GHz processors - many of the driving problems are trivially brute-forceable.<p>I read &quot;Punched Cards&quot; in part to get a sense of what it was like to think in those old terms. Now I want to acquire edge-notched cards and physically experience it. But no one sells those cards any more, and haven&#x27;t for decades.

And that of course hinges on how one defines &#x27;fair&#x27;. Many of the measures that appear objective aren&#x27;t. There is a growing amount of evidence that the method in which a test is administered can have a statistically significant impact on how different races and sexes perform [1][2]. On top of that, there is evidence that similar biases creep into how teachers grade essays and even math problems [3].<p>The second is more social science-y: switching to an algorithm doesn&#x27;t fix the problem that affirmative action attempts to solve, which is that even after correcting for any test bias certain minorities or subgroups will still perform statistically worse than others, not due to inherent differences in intelligence, but due to the cumulative effects of the inequalities of opportunities in society, eg lesser performing schools, less time/energy for parents to help with homework, less money for extracurricular activities, &c. &c. [4]. Yes, socioeconomic status accounts for a large amount of this, but it does not 100% account for it. There are still statistically significant amounts that are due to things like race, sex, or religion.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/picture-yourself-as-a-stereotypical-male"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/picture-yourself-as-a-s...</a>\n[2]: <a href=""https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/06/21/sat"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/06/21/sat</a>\n[3]: <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/02/10/teacher_bias_in_math_new_study_finds_teachers_grade_boys_more_generously.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/02/10/teacher_bias...</a>\n[4]: <a href=""http://thewireless.co.nz/articles/the-pencilsword-on-a-plate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thewireless.co.nz/articles/the-pencilsword-on-a-plate</a>",1443878577

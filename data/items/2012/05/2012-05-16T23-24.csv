There isn't very much of it as far as up to date examples and the API itself is not exactly complete. Since they went to version 1.0, much of their existing documentation is also depreciated.<p>I think in the near future as the project matures, it will become far more solid. It already has a big advantage of being open source and cross platform. Other such engines like Corona and Gideros for lua are closed and also have some limitations on how you can extend and use them at the code level.<p>I tried Moai for a few weeks for prototyping (after already trying Corona and Gideros before). I decided it would just be better to do the actual game in a native code framework on whatever platform (something like libgdx for android or cocos2d for iOS).",1337212761

I agree that it's really hard to think about how to communicate things that are just obvious to programmers.<p>But having spent some time teaching my daughter, I see some real value in starting with very (very!) basic programming. She was amazed that a one character typo made her program break. Nothing in everyday life - with the possible exception of government bureaucracy - is that unthinkingly inflexible. So she learned that computers follow directions explicitly, and what that means.<p>She also learned the positive side of this - that she was in charge. The computer did exactly what she told it to. I think that's empowering and revolutionary. It wasn't magic, it was a simple series of instructions.<p>From there, we've got a real basis on which to learn, ask intelligent questions, and figure things out.<p>EDIT: I agree with the comments, a lot of things are unthinkingly flexible. and the one of the best things to learn about computers is that for the most part you can mess around without causing real physical harm.",1337212717

A free gigabyte of storage. Messages displayed in context as conversations.<p>So what else is new?<p>Gmail has many other special features that will become apparent as you use your account. To help you get started, we encourage you to visit our Help Center, there you can browse frequently asked questions, read our Getting Started guide, or contact the Gmail User Support Team. You'll also find information in the Help Center on such topics as:<p>Importing your contacts from Yahoo! Mail, Outlook, and others to Gmail
Using address auto-complete
Setting up filters for incoming mail
Using advanced search options
You may also have noticed some text ads or related links to the right of this message. They're placed there in the same way that ads are placed alongside Google search results and, through our AdSense program, on content pages across the web. The matching of ads to content in your Gmail messages is performed entirely by computers; never by people. Because the ads and links are matched to information that is of interest to you, we hope you'll find them relevant and useful.<p>We're working hard during our limited test to improve Gmail and make it the best webmail service around.

I would like to see that same Go benchmark with 4 CPUs vs. Node and also vs. Node with a clustered web server and the code to see how much more code that involves for clustering with Node.<p>Also I would like to see some Go code and benchmark that reads a file and/or database in the request and works efficiently.<p>Actually the code for a Node cluster that would use all of the available CPUs for http in CoffeeScript would look like this:<p><pre><code>    cluster = require 'cluster'
    http = require 'http'

    numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length

3984672,comment,3983165,3983354,8,0,zemo,,,"No, the model is completely different.  In Node, you pass in a callback to establish what should be done following the return of a longrunning I/O operation.  In Go, you use goroutines to manage the concurrency.<p>Basically if you say this:<p><pre><code>    fn()
</code></pre>
The Go runtime will execute the function in its entirety and wait for a return value.<p>If you say this:<p><pre><code>    go fn()
</code></pre>
The Go runtime will execute that function in a new goroutine (the return value is discarded) and then immediately proceed to the next line in the current goroutine.<p>So if you have some callDB() function that performs some long-running i/o, in node, you might do something like this to perform that operation without blocking the surrounding code:<p><pre><code>    ...
    callDB(someparam, otherparam, function (result) {
        // do something with result here
    })
    ...
</code></pre>
while in Go, you would do something more like this:<p><pre><code>    ...
    go func() {
        result := callDB(someparam, otherparam)
        // do something with result here
    }()
    ...
</code></pre>
which winds up being more like this<p><pre><code>    func superGreat() {
        result := callDB(someparam, otherparam)
        // do something with result here
    }

    go superGreat()
</code></pre>
With the benefit being that if you want superGreat to run concurrently, you use the go keyword, and if you want it to be run in a synchronous style, you just call it normally.<p>The problem with Ruby/Python/etc is that it is awkward to take something that is blocking and make it nonblocking.  The problem with node.js is that node.js says ""blocking is bad; therefore, never block"".  Go takes a different approach, in that it makes it obvious to know how to write something so that it does or does not block, so that the developer is free to use whatever I/O paradigm fits the problem at hand.<p>The net/http package allows you to register a handler, which is a function that takes and http request and writes a response.  There is a main request loop that, when receiving a request, will create a new goroutine for each request and execute its handler in its own context.  So within your handlers, you mostly just write blocking code, because you're already in your own isolated goroutine, and the only thing you'd be blocking is the processing of the current request.  If you want to do something in the background, you run it in a new goroutine.  goroutines are very cheap, so you can be quite cavalier about their usage.<p>If you want to use a callback-passing style, you can do that in Go (because it has function literals and closures and first-class functions and all that), but that's not idiomatic by a longshot.<p>The absolutist position that node.js takes by saying that ""all i/o must be nonblocking"" is no better than our previous options of ""all i/o is blocking"".  Sometimes the simplest and most readable solution is simply to block.  There is a yin to the yang of blocking.",1337212101

And I would agree that programming is not the only way that one can learn the knowledge that one should have in the modern world so that one can be adequately informed on security/privacy issues and so on. But it certainly helps. Coding is becomming a less specialised job by the decade regardless of what any of us think about it. If one espouses the idea that 'programming is as important as reading' even if it may not yet be literally or globally true, then we are aiming for the stars and in the process, at least perhaps hitting a mountain.<p>No doubt your father is an acomplished man, but he would be a better Windows power user or sys admin if he was comfortable with PowerShell. One of my pet peeves are server admins who don't thnk they need to know any programming and thus don't truly understand the requirements of the developers who interact with their servers.<p>I feel that we're discussing things (if you'll excuse the clich) too far inside the box. If one has a very blinkered view of the advantages that programming can provide then yeah, it's just a highly specialised tool, useful only to a few. But that's not what programming is to me. To me, its about communication, expression of ideas and discovery.<p>You say that learning JavaScript won't help you to understand your computer better. I disagree. By learning JavaScript, you will involuntarily learn more about one or more web browsers and perhaps from there, you may become more informed on how information is transmitted across the web and perhaps from there, you may learn to better protect yourself through more consistent use of encrypted data transfer, just as an example. You are right when you say learning to program does not magically impart knowledge of file systems or networking but when I learned Ruby, I would have had to try pretty damn hard not to learn by osmosis at least something I didn't know before about these topics while I was learning the language.<p>So yes, in the narrowest sense, programming is not currently as important as reading.

3984637,comment,3983598,3983598,2,0,rdl,,,"I don't have a big problem with income inequality, compared to wealth inequality (averaged over a long time).  Consumption taxes and ""death tax"" (or at least a strong social convention toward donating assets in excess of a certain level, rather than heirs inheriting them) would go a long way.  Income inequality is largely due to differences in economic contribution, and encouraging people at the far right of the power curve to do more (and be more numerous) produces positive externalities.<p>The main quick fixes to the tax code which I'd like to see are immediately taxing carry as income, getting rid of deductions for employer health insurance and mortgage interest, and a national sales tax or VAT (ie consumption tax), ideally highly progressive or exempting the first 50k/yr or something.  Then, look at lowering income tax rates to something like 25% flat and setting lt capital gains and dividends at slightly less (20%) or the same as income but indexed for inflation.  Get rid of the AMT, and maybe lower corporate rates to try to get firms to repatriate more and avoid abusive tax structuring like the double Irish sandwich and such.<p>A more transparent tax code, even if revenue neutral, would boost economic activity.  A more transparent tax code, taxing things with negative externalities and not discouraging positive externalities, raising more income while cutting expenditures greatly, would be even better.<p>Not that there is much chance of any of this happening.",1337211300

Because of this there was a pretty significant investment in designing and deploying a really robust system, and it was rolled out extremely widely, including far flung and remote weather stations, and was adopted elsewhere as a standard as well.<p>Fast forward to today and the aging system does the job but is in a rather precarious state because everyone who designed and built it is long dead, and in the face of shrinking budgets, like the NYC subway system and the national air traffic control systems, for most of its history it was maintained just enough to keep pace but rarely upgraded.<p>Only relatively recently has there been momentum behind modernization and the big driver behind that has been the increasingly deadly tornado seasons we've been experiencing over the past decade or so. The need to be able to push out more geographically precise bulletins as well as to make them more impactful (they recently started using phrases like ""you will die if you do not seek shelter"" in select tornado alley locations) in the hope of decreasing casualties has been a major driver behind this change.",1337209256

Languages, and English especially, are full of little ambiguities; even simple words like ""or"" have more than one meaning! This doesn't quite cut it when it comes to specifications. If the spec is ambiguous then it's possible for two different implementors two come up with incompatible implementations, which kinda ruins the point of a spec. Try to think of RFCs (and standards in general) as the legalese of the software world. They're more verbose than you're used to, but that's necessary.<p>>have to remember their redefinitions of words like SHOULD, MUST, MAY...<p>Let's take a look at RFC2119 [1], where these terms are defined. The word ""MUST"" means you must do something, the word ""SHOULD"" means you should do it, but you aren't required to, and the word ""MAY"" means you could if you wanted to, but aren't required to. Well... that's what those words mean in English too! Are you really complaining that you must know English in order to read English?<p>The only slightly confusing word is SHALL, which is fairly uncommon in modern English. Even SHALL has not been redefined though, in RFCs it means exactly what it means anywhere else.<p>> And if you think the problem is just me, try finding any piece of software that actually correctly implements any RFC spec :)<p>Adding a smile to the end of your sentence doesn't make it any less stupid or wrong. Almost everything you touch today when using the internet is defined by an RFC. ARP (RFC826) is dead simple, and has been correctly implemented for decades. TCP (RFC793) admittedly took a few revisions to get right, but if it wasn't correctly implemented we wouldn't be able to have this conversation. Come up with your own examples, there are plenty more. If you think engineers are so stupid they don't know how to understand text which is a slightly more verbose than usual you have a pretty low opinion of humanity.<p>> So basically, the all text format of RFCs is the least of their problems.<p>Have you ever tried to read a spec which is actually difficult, like c++ [2]? Specifying a language is at least an order of magnitude more difficult than specifying a protocol or ""best practice"", and it shows in how dense language specifications are. RFCs are pretty damn readable, I often browse through them for entertainment.<p>> (I wonder how many people die every year because the National Weather Service issues tornado warnings in ALL CAPS with VROUS ABREVS throughout the text. Computers can do lowercase now, guys...)<p>Once again, you must have a pretty low opinion of humanity to think we don't know how to read abbreviations or uppercase characters.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt</a>

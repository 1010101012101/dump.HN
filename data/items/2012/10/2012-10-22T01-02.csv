4681510,comment,4680750,4681332,19,0,pygy_,,,"This article made it click for me. I had read several others that went over my head.<p>The point of promises, as explained in this article, is to mirror the error handling semantics of synchronous code with minimal boilerplate.<p>In code based on callbacks, if an error occurs somewhere, you must either deal with it locally or pass it along the callback chain manually. Promises mimic the try/catch system.<p>Here's a variation based on the first example in the WhenJS documentation[0]. It demonstrates the basic control flow, we'll see later why it makes error handling easier:<p><pre><code>    function loadImage (src) {
        var deferred = when.defer(),
            img = document.createElement('img');
        img.onload = function () { 
            deferred.resolve(img); 
        };
        img.onerror = function () { 
            deferred.reject(new Error('Image not found: ' + src));
        };
        img.src = src;

        // Return only the promise, so that the caller cannot
        // resolve, reject, or otherwise muck with the original deferred.
        return deferred.promise;
    }

    // example usage:
    loadImage('http://google.com/favicon.ico').then(
        function gotIt(img) {
            document.body.appendChild(img);
            return aSecondPromise;
        },
        function doh(err) {
            document.body.appendChild(document.createTextNode(err));
        }
    ).then(function(/*resolved value of the second promise*/){...});
</code></pre>
First, lets focus on the `loadImage()` function, which wraps an async image load into a promise object.<p>It first creates a deferred object wich has two methods and one property:<p>* `defered.promise` is an objet with a `then` method that takes two optional handlers (success,error), which returns another promise. This allows chaining (more on that later).<p>* `defered.resolve(result)` resolves the corresponding promise: it takes one parameter and passes it to the success handler.<p>* `reject(error)` has similar behaviour but for the error handler.<p>These two methods are mutually exclusive. If you call one, you can't call the other.<p>As you can see, `loadImage()` defines two event handlers for the img object, that will either resolve or reject the promise. It schedules the async event, then returns the promise object. The `then` method of the latter registers two handlers one of which will kick in when the async call resolves the promise.<p>--<p>There's no point in using promises for trivial code like this.<p>Their usefulness comes from subtleties in the way the `then()` methods propagate the successes and errors when they are chained.<p>Success and error handlers are optional. If at a given step a success/error should have been triggered but isn't, the value is passed to the next one of the same kind in the then chain.<p>Let's take the example in this article:<p><pre><code>    getTweetsFor(""domenic"") // promise-returning async function
        .then(function (tweets) {
            var shortUrls = parseTweetsForUrls(tweets);
            var mostRecentShortUrl = shortUrls[0];
            return expandUrlUsingTwitterApi(mostRecentShortUrl); // promise-returning async function
        })
        .then(doHttpRequest) // promise-returning async function
        .then(
            function (responseBody) {
                console.log(""Most recent link text:"", responseBody);
            },
            function (error) {
                console.error(""Error with the twitterverse:"", error);
            }
        );
</code></pre>
At each step, the promise can be resolved or rejected. If it is resolved, its result is passed to the next success handler. If if is rejected at any step, the following OK steps are skipped, and the error ends up being handled by the error handler defined in the last then clause. It is thus equivalent to this synchronous code:<p><pre><code>    try {
        var tweets = getTweetsFor(""domenic""); // blocking
        var shortUrls = parseTweetsForUrls(tweets);
        var mostRecentShortUrl = shortUrls[0];
        var responseBody = doHttpRequest(expandUrlUsingTwitterApi(mostRecentShortUrl)); // blocking x 2
        console.log(""Most recent link text:"", responseBody);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(""Error with the twitterverse: "", error);
    }
</code></pre>
Imagine how messy it would be to propagate the errors in standard callback-based code...<p>--<p>One last thing about handlers:<p><pre><code>    loadImage(src).then/*1*/(successH, errorH).then/*2 */(successH2, errorH2);
</code></pre>
loadImage() returns a first promise and its `then1()` method registers the handlers and returns a promise, whose state will depend on the behaviour of the handlers once one of them is triggered. If the handler (either successH or errorH) returns a value, the promise will pass that value to the next success handler. If the handler throws an exception, the value thrown will be passed to the next error handler, and so on.<p>This brings us the following parallel, FTA:<p>1. Promise fulfilled, fulfillment handler returns a value: simple functional transformation<p>2. Promise fulfilled, fulfillment handler throws an exception: getting data, and throwing an exception in response to it<p>3. Promise rejected, rejection handler returns a value: a catch clause got the error and handled it<p>4. Promise rejected, rejection handler throws an exception: a catch clause got the error and re-threw it (or a new one)<p>At last, a handler can return a new promise. In that case, the handler that is called next will depend on whether that promise is resolved or rejected.<p>--<p>Sigh... I'm done. I hope I didn't make things more confusing.<p>--<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/cujojs/when/wiki/Examples"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cujojs/when/wiki/Examples</a>",1350870831

4681506,comment,4681358,4681458,45,0,cletus,,,"See now this is an example of how US cell phone consumers have been successfully brainwashed. A $50 difference on the subsidized cost of a handset is not ""aggressive"" discounting; it's inconsequential.<p>Chances are you'll be paying $60-100/month for 24 months when you take out any smartphone service (or less if you go with T-Mobile or Sprint). Assuming $80 that's:<p><pre><code>    $199 + 24 * $80 = $2119
</code></pre>
vs<p><pre><code>    $149 + 24 * $80 = $2069
</code></pre>
which is less than a 3% discount. Now the service obviously costs something and you may not have it for 24 months (which probably means you're paying an ETF anyway) but that should definitely be how the consumer looks at it: would you rather pay $2119 for an iPhone and service or $2069 for a Lumia and service?<p>Even worse, I see people who will pay $2119 for the iPhone 5 and $2019 for the iPhone 4. It makes no sense.<p>Here's another way of looking at it: that $199 iPhone 5 costs ~$650 unsubsidized. Your ETF is (IIRC) $350 (-$10/month on the contract). If you terminate immediately you've paid $200 + $350 + probably $80 so basically full price anyway. If you do so after a year you pay $200 + $230 + whatever you've spent on service. $430 from $650 means they've discounted the phone $220 for you but you've also spent $960 on service.<p>To compare: when I got my iPhone 4 in Australia the 64G model was A$1000 at the time (the exchange rate was at the time a lot worse than it is now). Also, that includes tax (10% GST). Instead I bought the phone on a Telstra Business 24 month contract which was $50/month and $299 for the phone with a $100 store voucher (from JB Hifi), so $199 + $50 * 24 = $1399 - $1000 retail cost means I really only paid $400 for 2 years of service or alternatively the phone was discounted $800. Either way <i>that</i> is ""aggressive"" discounting.<p>Seriously, cell phones are an utter ripoff in the US. It still astounds me how expensive it is.<p>Oh and in the US you pay to receive calls. Not true in Australia and most of Europe that I'm aware of (certainly not the UK, Germany or Switzerland).",1350870689

4681501,comment,4680750,4680750,7,0,thristian,,,"Twisted (the asynchronous framework for Python) has an equivalent structure called a ""Deferred"":<p><pre><code>    http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/defer.html
</code></pre>
It's very similar to the ""Promises/A"" system described in the article, except that it has different method names (instead of .then(), it has the more prosaic .addCallback() and .addErrback()), and you generally have only one of them (instead of the callback-adding function returning a new, fresh, clean instance). Deferreds have the same ideal of composability, and the same mapping to 'try/except' statements in synchronous code.<p>However, there's one particularly handy thing Deferreds do that I don't see described in the article: when ""fulfilledHandler"" gets called, it can return a value which gets passed to the next callback in the chain, _or it can return a Deferred_, in which case the callback chain pauses until the new Deferred fires and produces a value, at which point the original Deferred picks up and carries on.<p>This comes in very handy for things like this:<p><pre><code>    def getReservedBooksForUser(username):
        # Look up the auth token for the library service in the DB
        authTokenDeferred = db.runQuery(""""""
                SELECT authToken
                FROM users
                WHERE username = ?
            """""", (username,))

        # We know the DB result can only have one row and one column.
        authTokenDeferred.addCallback(lambda resultset: resultset[0][0])

        # When we have the auth token, use it when querying the library
        # service.
        authTokenDeferred.addCallback(
                lambda authToken: web.getPage(
                    ""http://library/books?authToken=%s&user=%s&format=JSON""
                    % (authToken, request[""username""])
                )
            )

        # Extract the list of books from the returned document.
        authTokenDeferred.addCallback(
                lambda page: json.loads(page)['books']
            )

        return authTokenDeferred
</code></pre>
Note that the second callback (the web.getPage() one) is immediately called with the results of the first callback (the resultset-unpacking one), because the first callback returned an ordinary value.<p>However, the third callback (the JSON-unpacking one) is <i>not</i> called with the Deferred returned by the second callback - instead, the callback chain is paused while we wait for the second callback's Deferred to fire, then that <i>result</i> is passed to the third callback.<p>Is this kind of thing supported by JS Promises, too?",1350870564

Now in saying that, just because I hold out the possibility that such could exists does not mean that I subscribe to ghosts and seances or ingest hallucinogens in blind faith that it is opening up the ability to perceive additional dimensions, but I do feel that one cuts out a lot of possibility when they take to rigid of a Physicalism type view. The more we learn about reality the less real it becomes. It's fascinating to ponder, but the problem with pondering is everyone has convictions one way or another yet no one has proof, so there is never a resolution, so I tend to take the view that it is something best discussed among a group of peers that are interested in pondering the currently unresolvable.

You can set up a Redis server, and lots of different hosts can contact it and hit the SETNX message to see if some key is locked.<p>But then other folks would say, that's not distributed at all - because the redis server everyone's hitting SETNX on is a single point of failure.   It's the <i>servers</i> that need to be distributed.   That's a harder task, because the servers need to coordinate on whether or not key ""X"" is truly available or not in an atomic way, and that's the ""consensus algorithm"" thing that doozerd and I've also heard Zookeeper does, which I can only start to imagine how that works.<p>Based on the DynamoDB docs at <a href=""http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithDDItems.html#WorkingWithItemsConditionalUpdate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/amazondynamodb/latest/deve...</a> it seems like conditional updates work across distributed replicas, though it's only implied.",1350869540
4681474,comment,4680965,4681202,4,0,toyg,,,"The update to XP was not just an upgrade, it was also a clear separation of duties in the overall infrastructure. Back then, power users just had ""the latest and greatest"" as their OS; with XP, Microsoft introduced real, substantial, hardcoded differences between ""clients"" and ""servers"", with different development roadmaps that got more and more out of sync with each other. This mapped much better to the needs of corporate IT than the previous status quo, so they were happy to jump on the bandwagon as quickly as possible to put order in their ranks.<p>Also, XP had an uncommonly long life due to the ""security crackdown"" imposed by Gates. Microsoft decided to release a more refined product (XPsp2) rather than more experimental offerings, in order to shore up their much-maligned approach to security. This meant that software vendors could spend more time on a stable platform, resulting in a better overall experience for IT personnel as well as final users. And of course, its release coincided with the Golden Age of personal computers, which became even more ""personal"" when laptop replaced desktops.<p>XP was given more time and chances to succeed than any other Microsoft OS, so it's hard to compare it with anything else.",1350869526
4681472,comment,4680750,4680750,3,0,optymizer,,,"I've been using the 'async' lib in Node.js (I switched from 'step' lib) and I find the Promises' .then() method chaining and exception throwing really similar to async:<p><pre><code>    async.waterfall({

4681469,comment,4679458,4680563,4,0,rayiner,,,"I'm not making the simplistic argument that I'm glad that the government protects me from gangs. The gang example is illustrative of a deeper point.<p>The government's institution of property rights, which are protected by the police, army, courts, etc, makes everything around us possible. Without that basic order, there is no wealth creation. In the state of nature, a skinny nerd like Mark Zuckerberg is not king. In the state of nature, the kings are the people in the gangs: young, strong, capable of using and organizing force. I don't believe in a god that says ""thou shalt not steal"" or ""thou shalt not kill."" I have to depend on a utilitarian justification for the existence of property rights: that they allow the existence of the kind of complex society necessary to create wealth.<p>The imposition of this wealth-creating order is not free, and the cost is not just what we spend enforcing order. The cost is enormous: taking away the only natural ability common to all people: taking what you need. When we create property rights that allow a landowner to own vastly more land than he could personally defend, we take away the ability of people to hunt and fish and subsist on that land as they would in nature.<p>I believe that programs like welfare, food stamps, etc, are the moral obligation concomitant with the imposition of this highly artificial order. The order exists because it results in the greatest good for the greatest number, but in the process it creates a class of losers. I believe we have an obligation to take care of, as we can, the losers created by our order. I consider such expenditures to be a cost of creating that order that ultimately makes my income possible.<p>You don't have to agree with me. I think it's immoral to impose an order that prevents people from fending for themselves outside that order, and then to not provide for them. You may disagree with that.<p>Beyond that, even if you disagree with that premise, line item thinking is still nonsensical. For example, take the spending on Medicare and social security. You can disagree with whether national insurance is the most economically efficient way to take care of the elderly, but the cost wouldn't disappear if we got rid of those systems. Instead, the elderly would move back in with their kids, as they have done through human history. The cost to you is not the cost of the program, but the cost of the program minus the cost of taking care of your parents yourself. This is generally true for every line item--you have to engage in an alternatives analysis instead of chalking up the whole dollar value as not benefitting you.<p>Moreover, in many situations the cost to provide a service would be much higher without the government. For example, consider the 15% of all spending that goes to education. Our modern society would not be possible without this education, and employers benefit from it tremendously (what is the incremental benefit to an employer of someone who can't read versus someone with a public education?) People act like education is something that benefits individuals, but at the end of the day, an individual only benefits from his own education. An employer benefits from the education of each of his employees. And due to the public good nature of education, it's unlikely employers could provide it more cheaply than the government.<p>In general, I find the approach of ""look how much we spend on X"" to be intellectually lazy. Nearly every $1 you spend on taxes benefits you in some way. The debate is not about whether it does, but how much it does relative to that $1 and whether there are alternatives that cost less than $1.",1350869405

4681426,comment,4681325,4681325,10,0,andrewcooke,,,"i think the argument being made is that if you sample a continuous signal at a frequency higher than where most of the power in the signal's spectrum lies, then those samples are not independent.  so standard statistical tests that assume independent measurements overestimate significance.<p>so if you have two smooth, continuous signals, over a relatively short time (compared to the underlying process that is generating them) then you should simply ask whether they both slope in the same general way (if you like, there's a 50:50 chance that both go up (or down) compared to one going one way and one the other).  both sloping in the same way is not terribly significant (50:50 likely by chance).  and that doesn't change even if you sample like crazy, and generate lots and lots of points, which appear to show a hugely significant correlation.<p>[edit as i slowly grok this better] more generally, correlation coefficient isn't a good tool to use for comparing signals.  it should be used for comparing random samples from populations (a signal is not a population).  and i don't think people use it that way these days.  so i guess this paper won out.<p>but i may have missed something, or be simply wrong, because this was published 100 years after fourier died, yet when i scanned it i saw nothing that mentioned fourier analysis, which seems like an obvious way (see above) to phrase this (but i may be biased, since i guess fourier analysis boomed once machines existed to compute ffts).",1350868269

If you take the working definition that 'fair share' is 'all legally owed taxes' then guess what, all these people are paying their 'fair share.' So do you see the problem? You have an internal definition of 'fair share' which is inconsistent with what the folks who govern the UK have codified as 'fair share.' Is that Ebay's problem? Or is it yours?",1350868217

If it's such an easy pattern to spot, how come someone in senior management at Microsoft hasn't spotted it too? Is your average internet commenter really smarter and more perceptive than one of the world's largest and most successful companies? Furthermore, has Microsoft not grown as a company at all for the last ten years? Has the IT environment not changed at all either? And is history destiny?<p>I would argue no to all those notions. I think Microsoft in 2012 is a much more disciplined, focussed, and frankly ambitious company than it was in 2002 or 2006. The development of 7 and especially how the company communicated with the public about 7 was a quantum leap from Vista. As far as I can tell, Microsoft has carried forward all of those improvements into the process of building 8. If it is making mistakes with Windows 8, they are entirely different genres of mistakes than it made with Vista or ME.",1350867988

4681416,comment,4680887,4681372,8,0,newhouseb,,,"Most of the artifacts in Chrome Mobile stem from the fact that the latest stable version branches from Chrome 18 at which point the chrome compositor was in somewhat of a disastrous state (things are somewhat better in Chrome 20 and up).  Chrome attempted/attempts to support transforms regardless of the underlying engine (be it OpenGL ES 2.0 or skia) and as result of this ended up implementing a lot of things that would be handled by OpenGL ES natively within Chrome itself, like backface culling, clipping, layer sorting, etc.  Unfortunately, most of this math was wrong and as a result many things that use css3d transforms are a flickering disaster. Instead, I think they should have interfaced entirely through OpenGL ES and let a software implementation simulate it in the case of GPU-less hardware (which I think they've actually licensed and are already deploying in some later versions).<p>If you look at Safari, on the other hand, the only real major issue with 3d transforms is hit detection can sometimes be wonky, but this isn't something that OpenGL makes particularly easy anyway.<p>The ironic thing is that the stock Android browser is actually much better than Mobile Chrome, likely because it was written directly on top of OpenGL ES 2 from the start, whereas mobile chrome was actually a full port from the desktop. I haven't read much of the Android browser code though, so this is largely speculation.",1350867888

For example dynamic typing is necessarily slower.) that is faster than C#.<p>Er, but you can't just completely disregard implementation, because it really matters in practice.  You're not going to get a lot of adoption simply because your language is <i>theoretically</i> better/faster/...<p>In these language shootouts, Lua, a dynamically-typed language aimed at small size and simplicity, regularly beats out C#, because Lua has LuaJIT[+], which is a <i>really good</i> implementation, whereas C# for many people means Mono, which is at best an ""OK"" implementation.<p>It's the same as with algorithms: big-O complexity is obviously important, but it isn't everything; for real-world uses, the constant factors may make all the difference...<p>[+] The standard Lua implementation is also very good, but it's a more typical VM, and while very fast for a non-JIT VM, can't match LuaJIT in many cases.",1350867839

Universal health coverage is an obvious step toward alleviating this fear.  The abstract, vague notion of someday paying a (rather low) tax on the eventual, theoretical profits from the venture doesn't even come close.",1223675830

Posted to linode.com and Slicehost.com forums as well as the Drupal paid-services forum, soliciting paid, contract work to migrate to better hosting and optimize my server situation.<p>2. I received 18 responses.  Many were impressively detailed.  A few were hilarious: ""My brother's setting up a box.  It's 10x more powerful than anything out there.  Let us host you.""<p>3. I heard from a developer I already knew and have worked a bit with in the past.  Turns out he's interested and knows his way around Slicehost.  I hired him based on our past track record, at a price we both thought was fair.<p>4. Last night we moved my Drupal site to a 1GB slice.  It's already noticeably faster and is no longer crashing every 2 hours.<p>5.  Next week I have some ""Drupal sharks"" who'll start crawling over my install looking to optimize the Drupal piece of it.<p>So thanks, HN.  It was really useful to learn that I needed more RAM for my setup in addition to Drupal optimization.  I am happily on a Slice and now have an experienced hacker to defer to now and then.",1223673724

For shares traded in New York, for instance, annualised returns on perfectly sunny days averaged 24.8%, compared with 8.7% on perfectly cloudy days. Moreover, unlike some stockmarket “anomalies” discovered by economists, investing by the sun would have been more profitable than simply investing in the market index, even after subtracting trading costs. Alas, this does not guarantee profitable trading in the future. Even assuming the effect really exists, investors, now they have been alerted to it, will probably arbitrage away any excess returns to be had by exploiting it.<p><a href=""http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_RNQSDS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E...</a><p>So... it seems as if people really do think of everything - why wouldn't they, with millions or billions on the line.

For example, I'd pay for a tutorial that walks me through the design of a complete website app from start to finish, if it has video even better. Also, please don't  exclusively make it subscription based. I'm willing to pay 30 - 50 dollars up front to learn something in depth (it's similar to paying for an e-book) than to subscribe monthly for something I may not have time to go back to. Offer both options.<p>If you do go through this, please dedicate a large portion of time on your workflow and tools. Not enough programming, design books do this. For example, when I learned Python and Django it took me a while to figure out VirtualEnv existed and things like Vagrant etc.<p>Put up a landing page and ask users to leave their email, it will help you gauge interest.<p>Good luck!",1364579989

You just need to have a tool which can recover from corruption. And for very long the ZFS developers didn't think the end-users needed it. Maybe zdb was there all the time.

5462024,comment,5461259,5461701,6,0,fecak,,,"Agreed.  My theory on this one was based on some large companies in my area that had engineers with 20+ years of experience making 150K, that were horrified to learn that they were worth only 100K based on their skills.  They became 'valuable' to their own company, but didn't have that value to anyone else due to specific skills that didn't necessarily transfer (think proprietary langs and frameworks).<p>Long tenures can work both ways.",1364579976

5462022,comment,5460988,5460988,9,0,ScottBurson,,,"I lost a ZFS pool once.  The cause ultimately turned out to be a slowly failing PSU.  (It was an expensive OCZ PSU, too, which is why I didn't suspect it as quickly as I probably should have.  OCZ did replace it under warranty without argument.)<p>It was a development machine, so it wasn't being backed up.  I thought it was just one disk going bad; by the time it was clear that it was something worse than that, it was too late.  Most of the important contents of the pool had been checked into the VCS, but not everything.  I wound up grepping the raw disk devices to find the latest versions of a couple of files.<p>Any filesystem would have had serious trouble in such a situation, of course.  But I can't help thinking that picking up the pieces might have been easier with, say, EXT3.<p>On the other hand, I think it speaks well for ZFS that a slowly failing PSU seems to be almost the only way to lose a pool.",1364579970

5462019,comment,5461399,5461748,5,0,eric_bullington,,,"The way I see things shaping up is that Bitcoin will be used as a virtual store of value, used to transfer money to one or more other virtual currencies that place a higher premium on transaction speed.  Ripple.com could fill this role, or it may be another virtual currency that has yet to be invented.  It is <i>incredibly</i> easy to transfer money from Bitcoin to Ripple (and vice versa) once you know how, and any other virtual currency would doubtless share this characteristic.  As the Bitcoin ""market cap"" grows, it will become much less volatile, but will likely continue to increase in value<i>.<p>Actual Bitcoin transactions on the block chain would only be used to refill the other currency for day-to-day transactions, or for large transactions that don't have to be instant, like buying a car or a house.<p></i>Disclaimer: I own Bitcoins.",1364579944

But remember that 2001 was right in the middle of the era of MS dominance.  Netscape had been mostly beaten at this point.  Mozilla existed, but it was routine for sites to simply not work with it. Java was still alive and vibrant (.NET wouldn't arrive to kill it for another year), but it wasn't free software either and frankly worked rather poorly on Linux (and even, ironically, Solaris).<p>These were dark days.  The light didn't begin to shine at the end of the tunnel until Firefox started to crawl up the usage charts in 2003-4, and the beginning of the Web 2.0 era brought developer focus back to free technologies that it enabled.<p>Eventually it became clear that Microsoft had fallen asleep at the wheel, so in hindsight 2001 doesn't seem so bad.

I haven't actively searched for a new job for about 10 years so I didn't really know what to expect both in terms of available positions in my geographical area, Tampa, FL, and salary.  In the last 3 weeks I've received 5-10 phone calls and/or emails per day from recruiters with salaries that are all over the board, but higher than my current salary.  I have several years of .NET experience, but switched to ROR about a year and a half ago.  90% of the available positions I am contacted about are for .NET, which I don't really want to go back to.

But if you had two app ecosystems that were identical aside from the fact that one stored credit cards and the other did not, you would certainly expect a better app ecosystem with the stored cards. Having to enter your credit card is a source of additional friction that decreases people's purchase rates of apps, even if by a small amount (although my opinion is that it's by a large amount). Having an app ecosystem where people spend money and spend it more freely certainly seems to improve the ecosystem, if you take comparisons between the iPhone and Android app stores into account, especially in the earlier days.",1364579791

Let's assume that the benefit from bitcoin mining is roughly equal to the cost of the electricity used.  Electricity in the US costs about 12 cents per kWh.  Let's suppose you can get your web site visitors to put 100W of extra power into mining bitcoins for you.  And let's say your visitor spends 5 minutes (1/12 of an hour) on your page.  Then each visitor is worth 12 (c/kWh) * (1/12) h * 100 W = 0.1 cents.  Which would be like $1 CPM advertising.<p>But these are all best-case assumptions.  Your visitors might not average 5 minutes per page.  Your JS mining tool almost certainly won't be as efficient as the specialized GPU rigs that can mine bitcoin for less than the cost of electricity (and drive up the cost per unit for everyone else who's mining bitcoin).  Or your users might not have an extra 100W of power to throw at your mining operation.

 A conclusive explanation so far has escaped scientists studying the ailment, colony collapse disorder, since it first surfaced around 2005. But beekeepers and some researchers say there is growing evidence that a powerful new class of pesticides known as neonicotinoids, incorporated into the plants themselves, could be an important factor.<p> The pesticide industry disputes that. But its representatives also say they are open to further studies to clarify what, if anything, is happening.<p> They looked so healthy last spring, said Bill Dahle, 50, who owns Big Sky Honey in Fairview, Mont. We were so proud of them. Then, about the first of September, they started to fall on their face, to die like crazy. Weve been doing this 30 years, and weve never experienced this kind of loss before.<p> In a show of concern, the Environmental Protection Agency recently sent its acting assistant administrator for chemical safety and two top chemical experts here, to the San Joaquin Valley of California, for discussions.<p> In the valley, where 1.6 million hives of bees just finished pollinating an endless expanse of almond groves, commercial beekeepers who only recently were losing a third of their bees to the disorder say the past year has brought far greater losses.<p> The federal Agriculture Department is to issue its own assessment in May. But in an interview, the research leader at its Beltsville, Md., bee research laboratory, Jeff Pettis, said he was confident that the death rate would be much higher than its ever been.<p> Following a now-familiar pattern, bee deaths rose swiftly last autumn and dwindled as operators moved colonies to faraway farms for the pollination season. Beekeepers say the latest string of deaths has dealt them a heavy blow.<p> Bret Adee, who is an owner, with his father and brother, of Adee Honey Farms of South Dakota, the nations largest beekeeper, described mounting losses.<p> We lost 42 percent over the winter. But by the time we came around to pollinate almonds, it was a 55 percent loss, he said in an interview here this week.<p> They looked beautiful in October, Mr. Adee said, and in December, they started falling apart, when it got cold.<p> Mr. Dahle said he had planned to bring 13,000 beehives from Montana  31 tractor-trailers full  to work the California almond groves. But by the start of pollination last month, only 3,000 healthy hives remained.<p> Annual bee losses of 5 percent to 10 percent once were the norm for beekeepers. But after colony collapse disorder surfaced around 2005, the losses approached one-third of all bees, despite beekeepers best efforts to ensure their health.<p> Nor is the impact limited to beekeepers. The Agriculture Department says a quarter of the American diet, from apples to cherries to watermelons to onions, depends on pollination by honeybees. Fewer bees means smaller harvests and higher food prices.<p> Almonds are a bellwether. Eighty percent of the nations almonds grow here, and 80 percent of those are exported, a multibillion-dollar crop crucial to California agriculture. Pollinating up to 800,000 acres, with at least two hives per acre, takes as many as two-thirds of all commercial hives.<p> This past winters die-off sent growers scrambling for enough hives to guarantee a harvest. Chris Moore, a beekeeper in Kountze, Tex., said he had planned to skip the groves after sickness killed 40 percent of his bees and left survivors weakened.<p> But California was short, and I got a call in the middle of February that they were desperate for just about anything, he said. So he sent two truckloads of hives that he normally would not have put to work.<p>Precisely why last years deaths were so great is unclear. Some blame drought in the Midwest, though Mr. Dahle lost nearly 80 percent of his bees despite excellent summer conditions. Others cite bee mites that have become increasingly resistant to pesticides. Still others blame viruses.

But many beekeepers suspect the biggest culprit is the growing soup of pesticides, fungicides and herbicides that are used to control pests.<p>While each substance has been certified, there has been less study of their combined effects. Nor, many critics say, have scientists sufficiently studied the impact of neonicotinoids, the nicotine-derived pesticide that European regulators implicate in bee deaths.<p>The explosive growth of neonicotinoids since 2005 has roughly tracked rising bee deaths.<p>Neonics, as farmers call them, are applied in smaller doses than older pesticides. They are systemic pesticides, often embedded in seeds so that the plant itself carries the chemical that kills insects that feed on it.<p>Older pesticides could kill bees and other beneficial insects. But while they quickly degraded  often in a matter of days  neonicotinoids persist for weeks and even months. Beekeepers worry that bees carry a summers worth of contaminated pollen to hives, where ensuing generations dine on a steady dose of pesticide that, eaten once or twice, might not be dangerous.<p>Soybean fields or canola fields or sunflower fields, they all have this systemic insecticide, Mr. Adee said. If you have one shot of whiskey on Thanksgiving and one on the Fourth of July, its not going to make any difference. But if you have whiskey every night, 365 days a year, your livers gone. Its the same thing.<p>Research to date on neonicotinoids supports the notion that the products are safe and are not contributing in any measurable way to pollinator health concerns, the president of CropLife America, Jay Vroom, said Wednesday. The group represents more than 90 pesticide producers.<p>He said the group nevertheless supported further research. We stand with science and will let science take the regulation of our products in whatever direction science will guide it, Mr. Vroom said.<p>A coalition of beekeepers and environmental and consumer groups sued the E.P.A. last week, saying it exceeded its authority by conditionally approving some neonicotinoids. The agency has begun an accelerated review of their impact on bees and other wildlife.<p>The European Union has proposed to ban their use on crops frequented by bees. Some researchers have concluded that neonicotinoids caused extensive die-offs in Germany and France.<p>Neonicotinoids are hardly the beekeepers only concern. Herbicide use has grown as farmers have adopted crop varieties, from corn to sunflowers, that are genetically modified to survive spraying with weedkillers. Experts say some fungicides have been laced with regulators that keep insects from maturing, a problem some beekeepers have reported.<p>Eric Mussen, an apiculturist at the University of California, Davis, said analysts had documented about 150 chemical residues in pollen and wax gathered from beehives.<p>Where do you start? Dr. Mussen said. When you have all these chemicals at a sublethal level, how do they react with each other? What are the consequences?<p>Experts say nobody knows. But Mr. Adee, who said he had long scorned environmentalists hand-wringing about such issues, said he was starting to wonder whether they had a point.<p>Of the environmentalist label, Mr. Adee said: I would have been insulted if you had called me that a few years ago. But what you would have called extreme  a light comes on, and you think, These guys really have something. Maybe they were just ahead of the bell curve.",1364579230

A confirmation is generated by each block your txn is in, and a block is generated every ten minutes, so for 6 confirmations, you still need an hour.<p>Running a dedicated miner wouldn't help since you'd have to be the one to win the next block to be able to process your txns.",1364579206

Like.....<p>The decline of honey bee since 1947 has nothing to do with the top two points this guys claims. (Removable frames and opening the top)<p>After WWII, there was a drop off of number of beekeepers. This was due to changing agriculture and the dynamics of the family farm, with a huge surge towards cities and jobs. I will not even try to guess about the down fall of beekeeping due to removable tops, except to say that this is a key point in the narrow minded approach of the Warre hive crowd.<p>Up till the mid 1980's, beekeeping was healthy and productive. Losing 10% of your hives were considered a bad year. The worst thing that could of happened was getting AFB. (Which by the way was controlled by the removable frame Langstroth hive. AFB prior to removable frames were as high as 50% in some areas, and the basis of most inspection programs years ago. It was a serious matter destroying beekeeping back in it's day. The removable frame (and being able to inspect hives) was why AFB is controlled...even to this day.)<p>Then we had the introduction of varroa mites, trachea mites, various viral and bacterial issues associated with mites, a new nosema, and now small hive beetle. That does not even scratch the surface in regards to pesticides and the new classes of chemicals out there.<p>But the Warre crowd sprinkles the conversation with all the key words and talking points, to bash anyone not using a Warre hive, and tailors, or better yet,,,""warps"" all information to best fit their ideology.<p>But how can you claim that the downfall of beekeeping is caused by the Langstroth hive with removable frames and a removable top, and yet claim the root of CCD is chemicals and farming practices. I guess the Warre hive is immune to chemicals.  ;)<p>Anyhow...read the above post.

Remember, at the time when people still lived in the cities, the suburbs weren't like they are today. There were good schools and decent housing in the cities, because the middle class white people hadn't moved away yet. As someone pointed out elsewhere, the availability of cars to make the suburban exodus happened long before the suburban exodus itself happened. And let's face it, race place a huge role in living choices today. Check out: <a href=""http://www.city-data.com/forum/chicago"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.city-data.com/forum/chicago</a>. People are perfectly happy to be egalitarian right up to the point where it involves sending their kids to schools with heavy black populations. ""Gentrification"" is almost synonymous with moving blacks out of neighborhoods, and cities like to tout gentrification statistics, with their underlying tone of racism, without any of the bashfulness that is usually associated with even the hint of racism. People in Chicago considered it a great thing that the South Loop had gone from 35% white to 75% white in just one decade.<p>Look at it from a different perspective. Why is it that in Europe more of the population of the various metro areas lives in the city than in the surrounding suburbs, as compared to the U.S.? Do Americans just inherently like big houses and large lawns more than Europeans? And if they do, why didn't they move out of the city long before 1960, when it was eminently practical to do so?<p>That of course doesn't mean that suburbanites are racist today. After decades of suburban exodus the core cities are shells of their former selves, urban public school districts are almost exclusively for the poor, etc. There's lots of non-racist reasons, today, to not want to live in the city besides the inherent availability of lawns, etc. But given how racist society as a whole was in 1960, I think it's ridiculous to claim that the racial tension precipitated by the civil rights movement and desegregation didn't play a large role in tipping the balance between the cities and suburbs.",1364578662

Thus the natural conclusion is that corn syrup across the board is simply prone to being a little bit dirty in general. Enough that the bees notice the poison which they are acutely affected by.

The point is, the bee keepers probably aren't performing a taste test, and wouldn't notice the difference by eating it themselves anyway.<p>Then it just comes down to which growers actually use these new pesticides on corn? And then which corn syrup companies source their corn from these farmers?<p>Anyway, here's a research paper that purports some evidence:

The hive temperature thing plays a key role, in that the bees feed on the corn syrup while it's cold, during periods when they would normally feed on honey, and stay inside to keep the hive warm. The bees that are intoxicated abandon the hive, and fail to assist in providing the elevated temperature of the hive, leading to the hive's failure.<p>There's probably more to it than that, but like I said, that's my amateur understanding.

Because the two are largely equivalent in functionality (to the extents supported by the filesystem). Both fix filesystem corruption if they can. Just scrub can be run while the filesystem is mounted, whereas the traditional fsck must be run when the filesystem is offline.<p>However, scrub does not make ZFS perfect. There are still ways the filesystem can become corrupted without scrub noticing. Or corrupted in a way so that ZFS fails to recover from, even though recovering would be dead simple.<p>The attitude of the ZFS developers only works in the enterprise market: Your data is safe (checksummed, scrubbed, replicated using RAID-Z), but if a bit flips in the superblock just restore from your backup, because we won't provide tools to recover from that.",1364578511

5461806,comment,5460508,5461036,53,0,js2,,,"Reply from a beekeeper friend of mine in Atlanta, in response to the above. He's been keeping bees for about 5 years as a hobby.<p>----------<p>So, IMO this is about half true and a lot of it is conjecture or outright tin-foil-hatism.<p>What he/she says about the screwing around in the hive is at least partly true.  But most experienced beekeepers don't go in the hives more than they need to (I've been in mine [I lost one over the winter] twice since like October).  This is typically a new-beekeeper phenomenon (and more new beekeepers are not the problem).<p>The Langstroth hive does allow for more easily managed beekeeping.  Top bar hives are en vogue among the hippie beekeeping crowd - they are more common in third world beekeeping.  There are even some advantages to them (they are much easier to build, e.g.).  Without the Langstroth, there would probably be very very few backyard beekeepers.<p>Copious fucking with the bees is definitely part of the problem.  The largest issue, which the author points out, is all of the bee migration:  going out to pollinate almonds in CA, and then blueberries in MI, etc.  This is, as they point out, a MUCH bigger business than honey.  Honey is a by-product of pollination business.  This is only news to non-beekeepers.<p>Most of the pesticide issues with bees is from bee contact with things NOT used directly by the beekeeper.  Bees are extremely sensitive to pesticides.  If you are carrying bees all over the place, especially to farmland, you have a higher chance of them interacting with pesticides.  But I have a similar risk if one of my neighbors within, say, a mile, decides to pesticide up a plant that is flowering and my bees happen to be using it for food.<p>Yes, the chemicals used on bees are much like the chemicals used in, say, poultry or beef production.  Preventative and abused by overuse.  FWIW, I have all the chemicals, but have never treated mine.  Treating when it's appropriate is better than letting the bees get sick or overrun by parasites.  There is something called IPM (Integrated Pest Management) advocating this kind of appropriate treatment when necessary, along with other non-chemical preventative management.  Beekeeper certifications are based on these methods.<p>There are guidelines to when chemical treatments can occur to keep it out of the honey flow.  I'm pretty sure no matter how poorly these treatments are done, any ""poisoned"" honey is much healthier than any produce you'd get that's ever had pesticides applied to it (or, say, spraying yourself with DEET).  Remember bees are _extremely_ sensitive to toxins.<p>Varroa are the biggest  bee pest since they came to the US in the 80s.  Again this would only be news to non-beekeepers.  They are here to stay and we're now in the business of managing themthere's no getting rid of them entirely and the statement about how humans are spreading them around is a bit disingenuous -- bees are spreading them around just as well.  This is the same story as throughout the biological world where an invasive species is introduced via this new thing we call ""global travel"".<p>Cell size might be a contributing factor to some things (like mite populations), so I'll let the author have that one.<p>The hive I lost this winter was FULL of honey (> 10gal).  The bees still froze/starved.  They were just too weak eventually to maintain temperature and to get to the honey they did have.  Bees, given the proper conditions will produce WAY WAY more honey than they need and in fact, leaving it all on there increases the size of the hive they have to maintain, and can weaken their ability to fight off cold, disease, and intruders.  Sometimes nature gets the best of the bees.  The long warm fall/winter we had left the bees in a more active mode for longer with less incoming food and then the erratic winter didn't help.<p>I do feed my bees syrup or pollen patties or a combination of the two maybe twice a year.  Usually this is just pre-winter to keep them from eating into the valuable honey right next to the hive body before winter or to give them an easier/quick source of food coming out of winter.  This is only a supplemental source of food, the bees are almost entirely eating pollen and honey.<p>The bit about store honey is fairly accurate.  I would hesitate to buy honey from a store if I had a better source.  I'm not sure about the whole ""benefit"" thing -- I tend to believe that honey is mostly a simple sugar that isn't all that good for us and I don't buy into the whole eating honey with pollen will stave off allergies claim.  I eat it because I like how it tastes, not because it's a health food.  So some of that is also granola/hippie handwringing IMO.<p>BUT HERE'S WHERE THE BIGGEST BS COMES IN: The author's pontification on the cause of CCD.  Even if you know nothing about bees, just reading that paragraph sounds like conspiracy paranoia.  There are a lot of stressors on bees: parasites, disease, pesticides, commercial migration, etc.  CCD, however, is a very specific condition:  In simplest terms, the colony just disappears entirely.  The latest findings I read about were pointing to a combination of a fungal infection common in bees called Nosema with a secondary cause, perhaps a bacterial infection like Foulbrood or a viral one like Deformed Wing virus.  But the truth is we don't know.  It's not a conspiracy of government and big business.  Newsflash:  Also, the moon landing wasn't faked.<p>My $0.02.  Or well this is long enough to be more like $0.10.",1364577936

I'm not in the bitcoin game, but I think mtgox offers ""stop on loss"" features so that people could get out of bitcoins automatically.<p>If you're sure that you want to be in bitcoins, but you think that there are a lot of scared players who put their ""stop on loss"" too high, you might be able to provoke some kind of selling avalanche by selling sufficiently many bitcoins at once. The price drops below 90, which triggers a lot of automated selling. This makes the price drop even further, triggering other stop on loss barriers, driving the price to 80 and so on.<p>With your $5 millions you buy up all those bitcoins at a rate of 50 USD per bitcoin when the avalanche stops. Then people realize what just happened and the price of bitcoins crawls back to 100 because that was more or less the fair market price.<p>The point is, with $5 million dollars you might have the power to create digital panics, a ""flash crash"", and use that to your advantage.<p>I don't know if $5 million is enough for that, and it's not a guaranteed return.",1364577262

ZFS refuses to mount/import a corrupt filesystem.<p>In my case, the latest superblock (or some internal bookkeeping structures that the superblock points to) was corrupted in a way that ZFS completely gave up. So what I ended up doing is to manually invalidate the latest superblocks until ZFS was able to mount the filesystem. I may have lost the changes written in the few minutes before the corruption, but that's still way better than loosing everything.<p>Before I decided to poke around the raw disk with dd (to invalidate the superblocks by overwriting them with zeros), I googled around and I wasn't the only one with that problem. One other guy asked on the ZFS mailing list and the response was along the lines of 'Your filesystem is FUBAR, restore from backup'.<p>You may argue that ZFS itself should do what I did (dropping a few minutes of transaction history and roll back to the latest non-corrupt state) upon mounting. Fair enough. I don't really care if that functionality is built into ZFS or an external fsck binary. The fact is that ZFS wasn't able to recover from the situation.

Having watched a number of things become the object of speculation (stuffed animals[1], old computers, internet stocks, real estate, Etc) if you look at their value over time and their trading frequency the traffic develops a quick jump and dump mode when folks are speculating. I attribute it to people buying, capturing gains, then buying again to capture more gains.<p>I don't think its ""capped out"" what I think is that a bunch of people are jumping into the currency to make a quick buck. And the way speculation works is very much like musical chairs, you jump in and sit down, jump in and sit down, and hope that when the music stops you were sitting down and not standing. If enough players have the stomach for it (it can be both exhilarating and scary to gamble a lot of cash) then the run will continue, once it crosses some threshold, it will come crashing down.<p>[1] Met a person at a garage sale that had over 1,000 ""new in box"" Beanie Baby(tm) stuffed animals, including some of the ""really rare"" ones.

I'm not going to say that everything was fixed and all better after SoapUI 4.5, but the team did manage to fix some of the issues that we've been having on Mac.<p>That said, we know that our Mac version of SoapUI is still pretty rough (we actually have a blog post from a while of back referring to SoapUI 4.5 as the ""suck less on Mac version""). The reason for this is partly because Apple is doing its damndest to break Java on the Mac. But we've also needed to work on improving the Windows version, since that is what most of our users use. In all honesty, the reason we even have a Mac-version of SoapUI is because that team has a childish love for all things Mac.<p>We do have great hopes for the long-term: The new Product owner for SoapUI, Matti, is a Mac guy, our Technology Director, Henrik, for the SoapUI team only uses Mac, and the SoapUI Scrum Master, Ulrika, is a Mac fanatic  hopefully this all pays off.<p>So, please bear with us; we're working on some other projects that will delay any work on the Mac.

And today I'm at Joyent, where we run ZFS in production on tens of thousands of spindles and support software customers running many tens of thousands more.  Across all of that experience -- which has (naturally) included plenty of pain -- I have never needed or wanted anything resembling a traditional ""fsck"" for ZFS.  Those that decry ZFS's lack of a fsck simply don't understand (1) the semantics of ZFS and specifically of pool import, (2) the ability to rollback transactions and/or (3) the presence of zdb (which we've taken pains to document in illumos[1], the repository of record for ZFS).

Linux neither invented nor popularized filesystem consistency checking programs.  Unix filesystems (such as UFS) often have consistency checking programs as well, though they might not be called ""fsck"".  Windows has Scandisk.

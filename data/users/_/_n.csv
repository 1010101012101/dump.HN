AnaHuson,0,1,0.0,1,0,"Product and Background\nProduct is an innovative website portal which allows restaurants individually, and as an industry, to sell their goods and services online. It is differentiated from competitors such as Open Table in the extent to which restaurants can monetize products and services, increase sales, and receive payments prior to delivering the goods & services.\n The patent-pending system  built by restaurateurs for restaurateurs  has been created to leverage technology and E-Commerce giving restaurant pros more time to focus on their hospitality and F&B output while being open 24/7.  The software is loaded with a Suite of E-Products (4 in total), suggestive sales tools (to help increase each sale), industry-specific search filter icons, a simple two-prong loyalty program, a three-tiered advertising banner program: Product/Service to Restaurant; Product/Service to our Customers and Product/Service to Consumers or any combination thereof.  \nSystem has been beta tested in-house, and by the end of this month we will be looking to beta test with a limited number of selected restaurants. \nOur long-term plan is to apply this technology (baptized W.I.S.E.  Meaning Whole Industry Internet Sales Engine) to other industries such as the Health & Beauty Industry, Wineries, Bars/Night Clubs, Home/Interiors and Boutiques/Shopping amongst others.\nFounders Comments\nMy background in entrepreneurship includes 30+ years in publishing guide books with a focus on Food & Beverage in the Bay Area and internationally, advertising sales in Food & Beverage Guides to NY, L.A. and Florida plus launching an international franchise system for the founders family of restaurants. \nYour vision, expertise and impressive team would be ideal for this project because great minds think alike. Great Product + Great Team = Success. I am ready whenever you are! Please call me: 415.407-5571.<p>We hold the key to the restaurant industrys ability to sell online like the travel industry does. Its no surprise that investment in food industry technology is skyrocketing: http://www.cbinsights.com/blog/venture-capital/food-technology. The National Restaurant Association Ops Report also concludes that restaurants are ready to embrace new media and capitalize on the Internet to increase their sales. The size of the industry in the U.S. $660.5 billion sales projected for 2013, and were ready to take it on.",1366912966,1412973374

The breadth and multidisciplinary nature of my subsequent experiences has given rise to many different applications  (computational geometry and meshing, computational neuroscience, and computational mechanics/acoustics) in many different environments (internships at large simulation companies, appointments at university research groups, and a full time R&D position at US defense contractor). These experiences, however, have all been related by the common theme of combining Computer Science and rigorous mathematics to solve exciting computational problems.  Now, holding a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering, I seek to extend this lineage of computational software development into the field of statistical learning (Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, et al) with a Master’s degree in Computer Science from Brown University; and though I have limited formal experience in this specific concentrations of Computer Science, the breadth and intensity of my general mathematical and computational preparation is evident – skills which are fundamentally requisite and correlated to success in the field of machine learning.\n	Early in my undergraduate career, I began exerting substantial effort to the pursuit of computational and mathematical endeavors well beyond the requirement of my major, taking rigorous coursework in theoretic mathematics, simulation, and algorithms. The result of this was a high level of mathematical exposure, theoretical maturity, and perspective regarding the applications of my academic interests. This summarizes my experience at the University of North Dakota, and culminated in a year-long full-time appointment at the Pittsburgh-based simulation company ANSYS. This experience further refined and solidified my interests in mathematical applications in Computer Science, and inspired the last-minute addition of a major in Computer Science upon transferring to the University of Pittsburgh. These experiences had intensely refined my academic interests, and my time in Pittsburgh was spent working in computational and research capacities for 20-30 hours a week, in addition the coursework required to complete my two technical majors without delaying graduation. Assuredly, my GPA could have been improved by not perusing these time consuming endeavors, but I knew my interests and my priorities (for better or worse) were shifted accordingly.<p>RESEARCH AND EXPERIENCE<p>ML STUFF I&#x27;VE DONE<p>ML STUFF I WANT TO DO<p>CONCLUSION",1415729415,1453172219

anjamerret,0,11,0.0,2,0,"Anja Merret lives in Brighton, UK, having moved across from South Africa just over a year ago.<p>She now looks after the business interests of her daughter who is a Flash Developer and Accessibility expert. She started a blog at the beginning of the year under the heading of chatting to my generation. Although she is chatting to the baby boomer generation, she sometimes feels that all generations have the same issues to face, they just don't have hearing aids or walking sticks!<p>One of her pet peeves is the war in Iraq and in fact anything that causes innocent people to get hurt. But she also loves tech stuff, although only as an amateur. She considers herself a Silver Surfer Gadget Geek. She is even considering queuing for an iPhone in the UK later on in the year. But her daughter has offered, so she will only be taking hot food to the Brighton Geeks waiting in line.<p>Her musings may be found on <a href=""http://www.anjamerret.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anjamerret.com</a>.

Great for developers, professional networkers, entrepreneurs, sales forces, business development, journalists, job seekers and basically anyone else. Gnito makes it easy to control your own cross platform digital identity, and manage those of the people you meet.  Simply connect with people you like.  Gnito enables that very delicate balance between digital privacy control, and digital identity exposition.  What is the problem? Our digital identities are increasing disparate, with historical data spattered across numerous platforms, and no centralized dashboard to control them.  We develop from a mobile-first perspective, with novel and powerful Webservices behind-the-scenes, big data tools and visualization.",1381958252,1452922789

I went on to represent Team India at ISEF(International Science and Engineering Fair) 2012, and also won the Fourth Grand Award in Computer Science at ISEF.<p>This year, my project on Reverse Data Synthesis as a revolution in Artificial Intelligence, has once again lead me to represent Team India at ISEF(International Science and Engineering Fair) 2013 held from May 12-17. The project was also among the top 90 projects for the Google Science Fair 2013.<p>A month back, I decided I would make use of my experience in the field of research, and hop onto entrepreneurship, which has been a dream all through.

We work with our clients to help them level the playing field.  We know that ordinary consumers do not typically have information at their finger-tips to know when their doctors first prescribed a particular drug, or to know whether their pharmacist filled that prescription with the brand name drug or a generic substitute.

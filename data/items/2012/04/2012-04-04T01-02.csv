Second Life already offers an MMO with object creation (Minecraft) and scripting (0x10c). While the sci-fi story line is more appealing to me, the concept of building thing and coding their workings in a 3D MMO doesn't seem novel to me...

Usually the reason you have a pain point is either that you don't understand the underlying problem yet, or the solving it will take time.

3795835,comment,3795513,3795791,4,0,hkmurakami,,,"1. Definitely agree. But within hacker circles, I am sure there would be similar reverence for a beautifully written algorithm. So I'd venture to say that the issue isn't something that's <i>inherent</i> to software, but rather relative to our cultural/societal upbringing and education. There's the possibility that software may be understood by the larger population in the (hopefully not so) distant future.<p>(I'm probably aided by the fact that many of my good friends are coders, so even if I myself am not capable of writing such great pieces of code, I am constantly developing the crucial <i>context</i> and understanding for the creation process, and what kind of people/work goes into building something great)<p>Also, I have another suspicion, which is that the majority of work that's performed by the people who make such requests are in fact, <i>linear</i>. What kind of work do the ground level sales/marketing/pm types do on a daily basis? Whether it be crunching numbers or writing documents, making phone calls or preparing for meetings, most tasks <i>are</i> measurable and predictable. During my poker playing days, I remember the enlightening phrase, ""We expect the other player to act the way we do when placed in a given situation (ie against certain bet patterns/boards)."" Similarly, if our daily work is linear and calculable, then it is in our nature to expect the other kinds of work which we cannot completely grasp to be linear and calculable as well.<p>2. A better analogy for writing would then be a poem, perhaps even a Haiku (which only contains  5+7+5 = 17 syllables). Writing 17 syllables is something we can do in under 30 seconds; writing a masterful work of poetry is something that could take <i>years</i>. (but I completely agree with what you're saying :))",1333504737

3795819,comment,3793183,3794856,9,0,dmpk2k,,,"> I think you should read the M:N scheduling links.<p>I think this bears emphasizing.<p>Slow language runtimes, like Erlang's beam.smp, can get away with using M:N threading because the overhead elsewhere is so high. However, once you're dealing with languages implementations which are reasonably performant, which includes Go, M:N threading has problems which suddenly surface above the waterline. This includes various inefficiencies due to two schedulers fighting each other, significantly reduced system observability, and bizarre runtime behaviour (again, due to two schedulers fighting each other). If the ability to understand and maximize performance matters, M:N threading is a disaster.<p>We've been down the M:N road before for efficient systems (Solaris, Linux, the *BSDs, and others). Those implementations -all- died. Now Go (and Rust, both amazingly and depressingly) have resurrected this. I can only hope that the programming abstraction niceties that Go takes advantage of are worth the performance tradeoff, because there is a definite tradeoff.",1333504524

3795815,comment,3794249,3795552,1,0,oblique63,,,"> It is the sort of thing that can be a pain if you don't know it, but can be learned quite easily<p>I agree, it's not terribly hard to pick up the basic idea, but it still doesn't lend itself to the idea of being 'self-documenting', which has always been a helpful fallback when dealing with python stuff that I encounter problems with. I guess it kinda just feels like it encourages too shallow of an understanding of what's going on, especially if for some reason I might want to tweak/customize certain things later on; it feels more geared towards giving you a fish, as opposed to teaching you how to fish (which is highlighted by the 'standard' encouragement to use lots of code generation). Even after going through the docs, it took me way too long to get even a vague idea of how to properly set up a custom model/migration <i>without</i> the rails generator tool. But I'll admit, that's all a lot more in the realm of personal preference.<p>Bundler is cool, but even with strict versioning, setting things up for the first time is no walk in the park. I won't blame rails for that though, that's clearly more of an ecosystem problem. A bigger problem than versioning though (in my eyes anyway), is when plugins follow this 'rails-way' of doing things magically, and leave no clear way to troubleshoot problems when they arise (devise, I'm looking at you).<p>I too find the rails guides and rails tutorial to be immensely helpful, but it's more because I would literally be completely lost without referring to them every 5mins, than because I find them terribly insightful.  I know the django docs aren't <i>really</i> that much better, but since I can usually work my way around a django project without referring them as frequently, I guess my standards for them is lower? Same could be said for a lot of their plugins, because again, at least there I have been able to fall back on 'self-documenting code' most of the time.<p>I do think rails is pretty cool, and I could see why it got the praise it did, but I would probably only use it on small projects that involved only a handful of people from the get-go, because I would feel bad dropping a newbie onto a mountain of legacy rails code.",1333504422

Yea, other programming languages might not have to deal with concurrency issues, either by ignoring threading, giving up on an asynchronous system, or giving up on C interop; none of which seem like a worthwhile sacrifice.

In a surprising number of cases, the funder has wound up with a pile of money and not enough contacts with relevant people, so they really do choose people out of the applicant pool. It can also vary by country. In Europe, for example, how much relationships matter seems to vary north-to-south. In southern Europe it is pretty much 100% about relationships.<p>Perhaps in reaction to what's perceived as southern-European corruption, in Scandinavia there is substantial pressure on funders to make their decisions based on the official application process. There's a worry that ""contacts"" means your old grad-school buddy, someone you know from a sports club or weekly board-game get-together, etc., as opposed to scientific merit. There's also (what seems to me, as a foreigner) a strong worry that the process shouldn't be perceived as a sham, which means that at least some proportion of the funds have to be doled out according to the official application route, to prove to everyone that the system works like it says it does.

Software is a more like writing a novel than learning a song. The thing that takes longest isn't the actual writing, it's the figuring out what to write.

We are a year old startup that was founded by 2 technical and 1 non-technical founder.  We all have an equal amount of shares (non-vesting).

Unfortunately about 6 months into the startup, his story started to unravel. He had no contacts (he passed off people he met in passing or from LinkedIn as really good friends), talks a lot without a lot of substance, he is arrogant, the previous successes were exaggerated and worse than that he stopped doing any real work.

We've been trained and educated to <i>know</i> that writing, composing, and sculpting are iterative creative processes that don't have a linear measurement scheme.

// add some children here
JXPathContext c = new JXPathContext( n );
NodeList list = c.eval( ""child"" );
for( int i = 0; i < list.length(); i++ )

They are highly sought after by employers and the MBA program is designed to help them get jobs.<p>2) Technical person (including all types of engineers, many non-programmers) that are in a technical field because they saw a good $50k-$70k entry salary out of undergrad and wanted a safe job.  They saw the higher avg salary post MBA, did some quick math and determined making $120k-$160k post graduation and taking a 2 year vacation would be cool (they saw their business friends do no work in undergrad compared to them.)<p>3) A strange, hyper-motivated group that comes from all types of backgrounds.  They want to start a company and it is in their blood.  They can't shake it, they read hacker news, they study hard, they participate in class, case competitions, networking events etc.<p>They are the exception, but they will found something.  It may not be the next google or even a tech startup at all, but it will be something.<p>Group 1) Gets the 2nd best offers from big and small companies, they get to do cool jobs for the most part.<p>Group 2) Depends somewhat on the person, but they are at a disadvantage and they thought they were smarter than the business people, but the business people know business and typically best the technical people in interviews.  They do fine if they leave their comfort zone, but if they don't they are screwed.<p>Group 3) gets the best offers, best connections and enjoys it the most.  If you believe you are in group 1 or 3, your return on an MBA is amazing.  If you are in group 2, it is questionable.

3795722,comment,3795350,3795350,7,0,dkrich,,,"""You're actions speak so loudly that I cannot hear what you say.""<p>One of my favorite quotes of all time, by Ralph Waldo Emerson. If you are really more than what comes across on paper, you should have things to show that extend beyond what is on paper. Claiming you are smart and can execute will get you nowhere. I'd venture to guess that everybody who applies believes that they have that in spades.<p>But the larger question I have, and continue to have, is why people continue to view entrepreneurship as an elite club to which you must be allowed entrance. No offense to Y-Combinator or any other startup incubator, as I'm sure the experience is fantastic. I just think anybody approaching this as some kind of bridge that you must cross to achieve success is misguided. Successful startups were born long before incubators and they were built by people who knew how to execute and had the wherewithal to do so. The very fact that you have to plead to make the case that you can execute shows in many ways that you can't. An incubator should be viewed as one avenue to ramp up traction and execution, not a permission slip to do so.",1333502622

I agree that it is an amazing thing that only a fraction of the population needs to work in order for us all to live. I also agree with you that society will continue to grow richer for the foreseeable future barring massive loss of human life.<p>At the same time, unless something changes rapidly, unemployment will rise as low skill jobs go away. If we keep our current societal structure, or continue to cut benefits for the unemployed, we will end up with a more divided society than ever before. A wealthy elite and a starving mass is, to put it mildly, unstable. It doesn't matter that even the poorest will still have an improving standard of living. The perceived gap will be a problem because while society as a whole is ""getting richer and more productive,"" the majority of those gains are going to the top.",1333501232

Somewhere in your cost you have FCC/IC/CE testing, Bluetooth licensing/testing/certification, possible software stack cost and more expensive components (radio, antenna, etc). You also have a larger power requirement as low energy isn't as low as UART. I won't give specific numbers here as I cant't legally, but the cost difference is probably a wash. That's assuming your doing the radio layout and not using a module. Apple's move to wireless is definitely for their sake. I could also see an argument made that because of the possible extra costs for doing Blouetooth Low Energy (chips, testing, power, RF design, etc) you may see less accessories for a while.<p>In any case I think you're right that the tell tale signs are there.",1333501207

And fission reactors also have this problem to some degree, although their neutron radiation has very different energy profiles compared to fusion. When they are dismantled their reactor cores also have to be treated as waste. But unlike fusion plants you have to deal with the structural materials AND the actual spent fuel. So fusion plants will generally be better than fission, no matter what you end up doing.<p>Additionally the high energy neutrons of fusion reactors may prove useful to transmutate radioactive waste from fission plants so they might actually lead to a net reduction in radioactive waste.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Fusion_Materials_Irradiation_Facility"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Fusion_Materials_...</a>",1417098465

There are also numerous technologies for marking up semantic content and/or styling such data for presentation.<p>The only thing that isn&#x27;t changing right now is that we&#x27;re still stuck with eventually reducing these alternatives to plain HTML for display in browsers, which is about as good an idea as insisting we reduce all styling to CSS and all programming to JavaScript.

The language is built around the idea of reducing complexity, about making things isolated and independent. Idiomatic Clojure code therefore tends to have a very flat structure consisting of isolated functions and data structures. It has a very high degree of code reuse, because it explicitly rejects encapsulation.<p>Clojure&#x27;s syntax may be unusual, and individual forms are more information dense than many languages, however the <i>structure</i> of Clojure code is often much easier to understand, and for any non-trivial piece of code, that&#x27;s the hardest part of comprehension.<p>When I come across a new Clojure library, I&#x27;ll often find myself reading a bit of the docs, then heading into the source code to get an idea of how it operates. I rarely do this with an object orientated language, as OOP code tends to be deeper, more interconnected, and because of encapsulation, have more methods to understand.

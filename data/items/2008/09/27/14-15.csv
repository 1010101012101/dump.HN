And listing ""projects"" like hexdump is kind of cute -- it's 211 lines of code.<p>The one claim that stood out there -- the one that gave a really testable statement that would have surprised me if true was, <i>""ESR is the second biggest lisp contributor to Emacs after RMS""</i>.  I thought, hey, there'd be a surprise, so I decided to run cvstat on the emacs lisp subdir:<p><pre><code>  - RMS contributed the 2nd most code to Emacs' Lisp with 217542 lines of changes.\n  - ESR contributed the 39th most code to Emacs' Lisp with 6367 lines of changes.\n</code></pre>\nThe reason that I don't like the guy so much is because he claims to speak for a movement, that by his own prognostication is a meritocracy, and I don't feel like he has the credibility for that.

Why did we (human beings) spend so many resources and so much effort developing the LHC when it seems obvious that a comparable amount of effort and resources could have dramatically improved our way of life?</i><p>That's a complicated question, the stuff of long-winded conversation. I'd say that it boils down to (very overgeneralized here) <i>we</i> didn't, a certain set of people did - who happened to be able to get the funding needed to undertake a pretty amazing thing.<p>Sometimes I think I just read too much Asimov as a kid, I think that there's a pretty big under-use of technology for the purposes of making everyone's life better. When I think about the reasons for that, my head starts to boggle after a while. I do think that another large reason for the state of things right now is that our <i>ability</i> to do really, really awesome things for humankind has only recently become very apparent.<p>If you ever open your resturant, I'd recommend using both slogans.

People should no longer have to generate money for food and roofs, or if they do, they should not have to resort to doing repetitive, boring, brainless work all the time.<p>Unfortunately, there is no simple solution to this, and most feasible solutions require an overhaul of most of our economic structures, not to mention the education system, and a whole bunch of other stuff.<p>Edit: I somehow missed the ""still cheaper than full automation"" part.

316899,comment,316510,316510,0,0,parenthesis,,,"I particularly liked this:<p>""Although the use of metaphor may ease learning for the computer novice, it can also cripple the interface with irrelevant limitations and blind the designer to new paradigms more appropriate for a computer-based application. The designers of the Phelps farm tractor in 1901 based their interface on a metaphor with the interface for the familiar horse: farmers used reins to control the tractor. The tractor was steered by pulling on the appropriate rein, both reins were loosened to go forward and pulled back to stop, and pulling back harder on the reins caused the tractor to back up [5]. It's clear in hindsight that this was a dead end, and automobiles have developed their own user interfaces without metaphors based on earlier technologies. Nonetheless, people today are designing information-retrieval interfaces based on metaphors with books, even though young folks spend more time flipping television channels and playing video games than they do turning the pages of books.""",1222524965

Unfortunately, where I live it's not easy to find like-minded people who are willing to meet regularly and provide mutual encouragement. Moreover, one thing that I really miss about school is the social life. I almost don't have any friends I can count on. I mean I've friends but number is relatively lower than someone who went to school for four years. Besides, for some reason I really miss the energy and atmosphere of a school.

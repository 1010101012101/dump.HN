To my knowledge there was never any direct funding of Iraq's military by any Western state during the Saddam era.<p>The West was certainly not averse to selling weapons to the country, though neither was the Soviet bloc. During the 1980s the Iraqi air force was equipped mostly with French aircraft, and the army mostly with Soviet tanks, vehicles and weapons in addition to a smattering of weapons from other sources such as 100 G5 155mm howitzers from South Africa.<p>But it need not be said that selling weapons to a country is very different to funding its military.",1297684746

The Tab arbitrarily locks up depending on the software you're running (as in stops responding, requires a hard reset to be usable again), their Bluetooth implementation is terrible and doesn't function right (I guess their choice of Bluetooth hardware didn't work with the default Android drivers so they had to write their own; somehow software that runs perfectly on a Nexus One or Motorola/LG hardware totally keels over on Samsung hardware) and their customized software overlay is amazingly sluggish.<p>Lets not get into the monstrosities that are their feature phone operating systems.

Likewise users of the site have been asking for adverts so that they have a kind of slow beacon showing what new stuff has emerged that they might've missed in the ebb and flow of fast moving conversation.<p>So the lesson I've learned is to quit holding an anti-advert bias and to listen to the users more.

There's so much I could still do with the pet project and haven't been doing because I've been researching more complex things... this is dumb of me in the short term as I could be building the pet project into the main entity and sustaining a proper income from it.<p>Both of these lessons lead to the same thing: Quit being blind about your realities.

Every GP seems to follow the ""you're stressed out? psychosomatic complaints? here have some $neurotransmitter_modifying_medicine"" route without looking at the _real_ cause(s).<p>I can't think (memory still goes and comes..it sucks) of the famous ancient Greek who said it, but paraphrased:<p>""You cannot fix/heal anything if you don't know the underlying cause.""<p>The rest is just the suppression of symptoms..",1297683230

[3] This begs the question of why he said this. The reason he gave at the time was that most of his time was being taken up dealing with multi-language integration issues. However, this was belied by the following fact: shortly before the review, I met with the integration engineer and offered to help him with any Lisp-related issues he was encountering. He replied that there weren't any that I could help with. So while there were issues that arose from the fact that Lisp had to interoperate with C, I do not believe that a good-faith effort was made to address those issues.<p>Postscript: Many of the multi-language integration headaches were caused by the interprocess communication system that allowed Lisp and C to communicate. The IPC relied on a central server (written in C) which crashed regularly. Getting rid of Lisp did in fact alleviate those problems (because the unreliable IPC was no longer necessary). It is nonetheless supremely ironic that the demise of Lisp at JPL was ultimately due in no small measure to the unreliability of a C program.

How does that imply unbounded money?<p>> the amount of money it would take to bankrupt the supporting country<p>The budget that's just been hacked at -- the DOE's science funding, which according to the article provides most of the US's funding for basic scientific research -- is about $5B. The US federal budget is somewhere north of $3T. It is not the science spending that is going to ""bankrupt the supporting country"".<p>> There isn't a government expenditure that can't be supported the exact same way and with virtually the same arguments<p>That would be fair comment if the proposal were a blanket 20% cut across all government spending. But of course it isn't. The proposed cuts are in fact about $100B, or about 3% of the federal budget. So the question isn't ""should basic scientific research be exempt from cutbacks when the country's finances are in trouble?"" but ""should basic science suffer 7x greater cutbacks than government spending as a whole?"".<p>(Actually, I bet these cutbacks aren't the whole story and there are other reductions going on that aren't covered by this list.

2216301,comment,2215243,2215503,0,0,wil2k,,,"The problem is that the debt can only grow and grow and grow. Why? Because the government is not creating the money but borrowing it from the private banks..(the Federal Reserve is everything BUT 'federal') and the government needs to pay interest. That way, there's never enough money in existence to EVER pay of the debt, because the ""debt"" amount of money only exists.. not ""debt + interest"".<p>So, the interest monster will just get more hungry every year, month, day and second..<p>I was down voted for posting the following, but it truly hits the essence of the problem:<p>Watch this, it's awesome:<p>The Secret of Oz <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qIhDdST27g"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qIhDdST27g</a><p>Quotes:<p>""What can government do? The sad answer is -- under the current monetary system -- nothing. It's not going to get better until the root of the problem is understood and addressed. There isn't enough stimulus money in the entire world to get us out of this hole.<p>""Why? Debt. The national debt is just like our consumer debt -- it's the interest that's killing us.<p>""Though most people don't realize it the government can't just issue it's own money anymore. It used to be that way. The King could just issue stuff called money. Abraham Lincoln did it to win the Civil War.<p>""No, today, in our crazy money system, the government has to borrow our money into existence and then pay interest on it. That's why they call it the National Debt. All our money is created out of debt. Politicians who focus on reducing the National Debt as an answer probably don't know what the National Debt really is. To reduce the National Debt would be to reduce our money -- and there's already too little of that.<p>""No, you have to go deeper. You have to get at the root of this problem or we're never going to fix this. The solution isn't new or radical. America used to do it. Politicians used to fight with big bankers over it. It's all in our history -- now sadly -- in the distant past.<p>""But why can't we just do it again? Why can't we just issue our own money, debt free? That, my friends, is the answer. Talk about reform! That's the only reform that will make a huge difference to everyone's life -- even worldwide.<p>""The solution is the secret that's been hidden from us for just over 100 years -- ever since the time when author L. Frank Baum wrote ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.""",1297681346

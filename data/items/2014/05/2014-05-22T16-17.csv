7784823,story,,,1,4,DaveyStrand,"Ask HN: Trial Freelancing? ",,"My business partner and I have been looking for a web developer to help us build a first version of our website. Rather than hire a freelancer outright, we would like to find someone who is interested in doing a &quot;Trial Freelance&quot; period where the developer would get paid to build out an MVP. Upon finishing this initial product and assuming it&#x27;s satisfactory, both the developer and ourselves can assess if we enjoyed the process / working with each other and perhaps continue on together as our startup evolves.<p>The Trial Freelance would be a complete standalone deal. If either side didn&#x27;t enjoy working w/ the other or decided to go another direction for any reason, there would be no pressure to continue working together. A test run of sorts.<p>We have found that services like Odesk often yield diluted results and set a precedent towards pure freelancing, while headhunting services often pair us with development companies who are only interested in getting us to pay as much as possible for as much as possible. We are trying to find a happy medium.<p>We have mock-ups, a business plan, and expansion strategy. We both have experience at prestigious companies and are ready to do our own thing with the best of intentions, but have found that many programmers in the freelancing field are weary of starry-eyed MBA grads and wannabe millionaires who have not done their homework. Starting a company is hard enough without delusions of grandeur!<p>TL;DR: Trial Freelancing is standalone deal where a developer builds an MVP with an eye towards potentially continuing to work with the business (s)he is freelancing for.<p>Does the idea of Trial Freelancing sound appealing?",1400777827

7784780,comment,7782625,7782863,7,0,JPKab,,,"When I was 12 years old, a larger, older boy was drowning in the Chesapeake Bay.  It was the kind of beach where the water is knee deep for 100 years out from shore, but then suddenly drops off to 11 feet or so of water.<p>He was bouncing off the bottom to get air (he couldn&#x27;t swim) but his face was turning blue, and he was making choking noises and frantically splashing.  I tried to grab him, and pull him to the sandbar.  He clawed onto me and began drowning me.  I punched and pried and kicked underwater to get him off of me, and thanked God when I got him off and got ten feet away and got air again.  I yelled for help.  The people on the beach 100 yards away did nothing.  Perhaps it was disbelief...  I ran through the knee deep water as fast as I could to them and yelled for help as I got there.  Nobody moved.  I wasn&#x27;t thinking, just moving, and there were those styrofoam noodles on the ground next to their blanket.  I snatched one without saying a word and ran back to the water faster than I ever have before.<p>By the time I got to him it was ugly.  He was still bouncing up from the bottom, but he was barely conscious, and his face looked like something from a horror movie. I&#x27;ve seen some horrific shit, but a drowning person at that stage looks like a zombie. He grabbed the noodle, and I pulled him the 15 feet or so to the sandbar.  15 feet, and it was knee deep water.  He couldn&#x27;t walk, and I picked him up fireman&#x27;s style, and he was coughing out and puking water all down my back as I carried him to shore.  This was the 90s, so there were no cell phones in the rural county I lived in.  I ran into a house near the beach and had the ambulance come.  He almost died later of a lung infection, but he&#x27;s ok now.<p>I asked my dad that night why nobody helped.  My dad told me that I was a &quot;helper&quot; like him.  (he was a volunteer EMT his whole life, and a volunteer fireman.  Plus I watched him help strangers all the time growing up.)  &quot;Most people aren&#x27;t helpers.&quot; he said.<p>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I figured out that is the case.  And when you a helper, you have to help a lot.  I don&#x27;t know what it is, but basically maybe 80 to 90% of people don&#x27;t do shit in these situations.  They subconsciously don&#x27;t even notice.  And being a helper sucks, a lot, sometimes, but you still do it because you don&#x27;t think you just do and your gut won&#x27;t let you.  You can&#x27;t walk away because of some deep down feeling that you are subhuman if you do.<p>My worst helper experience was stopping a guy in a rural NC bar&#x27;s parking lot from beating his girlfriend.  I started fighting him, and his GF (who he had just been beating) smashed a bottle on my head.  My vision went blurry, and she jumped on my back and I fell to the ground.  They both then proceeded to beat the shit out of me on the gravel parking lot ground.<p>Now, I avoid going into the &quot;hipster&quot; neighborhoods of DC.  As my wife pointed out, nobody in these neighborhoods is a helper.  Helpers can&#x27;t live in these neighborhoods long, because inevitably you end up getting sucked into this shit and you are always alone.<p>Did I oversimplify?  Maybe.  But that&#x27;s my experience.  I can&#x27;t help but help people in trouble, and in urban and suburban areas, its probably a bad evolutionary strategy.  In the country, not so much.  People care there, and they reciprocate.  This is probably due to such small social groups.......  Wow, I ranted for a while.<p>I&#x27;m so sorry for this woman......

Most other compiled languages are actually quite fast to compile. Go is striving to be fast even so, but when benchmarked against something other than C or C++ it seems less spectacular.)<p>Nowadays, especially with unity builds, a lot of the reason that C and C++ are slow to compile (especially C) is actually that optimizations and codegen take a while. Most languages use JITs, so their compile steps are much faster. With the 6g/8g compilers, Go doesn&#x27;t really do the same kind of optimization that e.g. GCC and LLVM do (e.g. SSA conversion, GVN, SCCP, LICM, aggressive algebraic simplifications, etc), so much of its build speed comes from that.<p>In my experience, there&#x27;s no free lunch: fast compiles come at the expense of runtime performance, and runtime performance comes at the expense of fast compilation.",1400776632

The demonstrated games include tangram, a tile based word guessing game, and a physics-engine based game in which players must draw a path for falling objects to hit targets.<p>While the product describes itself as using &quot;reflective artificial intelligence, a groundbreaking technology that bridges the real and digital realms for unlimited possibilities of play&quot;, it falls under what we in academic HCI call &quot;tangible interaction&quot;, following Shaer & Hornecker&#x27;s definition:<p><i>&quot;Interfaces that are concerned with providing tangible representations to digital information and controls, allowing users to quite literally grasp data with their\nhand and effect functionality by physical manipulations of these representations.&quot;</i> [0]<p>The four claims typically made when introducing tangible interfaces in products for children are usability benefits, learning benefits, collaboration benefits, and fun benefits [1]. Osmo does not escape to the rule, claiming all 4 in its marketing copy.<p>While Osmo does not include any information about research conducted with it that would demonstrate those claims, similar systems have been proposed in the past.<p>The word game is mirrored in Dekel & al&#x27;s Spelling Bee [2], a game which uses wooden letter blocks instead of Osmo&#x27;s Scrabble tiles, and LEDs embedded in the cubes to provide player feedback. The authors report high engagement from the test audience (children 7-12), but no learning assessment or long term engagement study was performed (arguably 2 of the most important metrics).<p>The tangram game is mirrored in past research projects, including Scarlatos & al&#x27;s [3] tangram game. Xie & al&#x27;s [4] paper performs a user study on 3 implementations of a puzzle game: physical, GUI based, tangible. The authors report finding same self-reported level of enjoyments from the test users on all 3. However, they report that repeat play was more significant in the physical & tangible version of the game, which does not create an argument in the favor of Osmo. They do report significant gender effects in the way of collaboration, which could be relevant for Osmo:<p><i>&quot;While all gender pairings’ mean scores on the Interest and \nEnjoyment subscale were nearly the same for the TUI \ncondition, the boy-boy pairs had significantly higher scores \nthan the girl-girl and girl-boy pairs for the GUI condition. \nIn addition, the girl-girl pair scores were significantly \nhigher for the traditional PUI condition than for either of \nthe computational conditions (GUI, TUI). For girl-girl pairs \nmean scores for Perceived Competence subscale were also \nhigher for the PUI condition than for either of the GUI or \nTUI conditions. Mean scores for boy-boy pairs were highest \nfor the GUI condition.&quot;</i><p>The last game implemented by Osmo, the physics game, is the least interesting of the 3 as it has less claims to educational value than the other 2. However, it is reminiscent of several similar tabletop based tangible systems and augmented reality systems.

This gets perilously close to claiming copyright infringement, with the added wrinkle that the simplest way for someone to take code that was previously claimed to be GPL infringing is to create and ship a new library which is ABI compatible.   So something could be a GPL violation, and then when a new library ships, et voila!, it&#x27;s not no longer a violation.  And something could orignally clearly not be a GPL violation, but when a new library ships which has a dependency (implied or explicit or even conditional in the case of an optional dlopen) on GPL code, now that proprietary binary can now run with GPL&#x27;ed code in its address space.",1400775249

The product took off pretty quickly and is still being used today by big companies. HTML had only very basic markup (no CSS yet) and the only method for talking to a web server was CGI programs. But you could do tables, and those were adequate for generating business reports. Java 1.0 had just been released.<p>This was long before the web had become a popular culture phenomenon: most people outside of academia didn&#x27;t know what the internet was, and search engines were in their infancy (Alta Vista was founded that year). Windows 3.1 did not have a built-in TCP/IP stack, so you had to be a geek just to figure out how to connect your home machine to an ISP via a dial-up modem (Windows 95 made it much easier) and install a browser. However, the web was starting to catch on in the business world as companies started putting useful information on the web and their intranets. It was an exciting time to be working with that technology since the potential was largely untapped.",1400774914

7784509,comment,7783588,7783588,2,0,fabulist,,,"I&#x27;ve read some great books from Packt, this wasn&#x27;t really one of them. When the first thread was on HN, I got excited because I love Python and had been looking into starting some investments. Namely, I want to implement a low-risk, low-frequency automated trade strategy. Naively, I assumed this book would be for people who knew Python and were interested in learning finance, but it was the opposite. A lot of concepts were thrown out there with little to no explanation. I gave up reading it until I actually know finance, and can use it as a cookbook.<p>The code in the book is also shoddy. I don&#x27;t have it with me, but two examples come to mind. I didn&#x27;t run any of the examples, but eyeballing them I some of them wouldn&#x27;t run because of syntax errors -- rather unfortunate for a beginner&#x27;s text. The section of naming conventions. To write a program using a financial expression like P(1+r)<i></i>n (exponential growth/decay), the book recommends against using confusing variables like p... in favor of P. P stands for Principal in this case, and I doubt many of you knew that off hand.<p>For those looking to do finance in Python, I recommend looking into QuantLib[1]. I&#x27;m also watching a series of videos from the University of Michigan&#x27;s online Intro to Finance class on YouTube[2]; however I realized a few days ago that they&#x27;re probably pirated. That makes me feel bad, but its still a good reference.<p>If any quants on HN have some better book recs, they would be strongly appreciated.<p>Edited to add; To be fair, I haven&#x27;t really touched the section on Monte Carlo simulations, which seems to be the bulk of the value.<p>[1] quantlib.org<p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQeZqn-8yM8&list=PL07D40483B1BE4B4C&index=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQeZqn-8yM8&list=PL07D40483B...</a>",1400774813

I even had a decent IT job in college, but thought it so shameful not to have a college degree that I quit to continue my studies and, of course, get deeper into debt.

ADHD kids in the past were beaten, called losers, call sinful, called stupid, etc. Society hit them as hard as it could, yet it didn&#x27;t fix anything.  We&#x27;ve moved away from that mode of thinking and realized that some kids just aren&#x27;t going to grow out of it and its not their fault.  The same way that Alzheimers has been part of the human condition for god knows how long yet we only &quot;discovered&quot; it 1906. Before that, we just thought it was part of getting old and didn&#x27;t realize its actually separate from aging the same way ADHD is separate from being an energetic child.<p>> Certainly it&#x27;s less addictive than caffeine.<p>Getting off caffeine is trivial.

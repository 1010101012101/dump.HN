3619183,comment,3618946,3619124,17,0,noonespecial,,,"120v @ 15A is 1800 watts. As I said, I was able to measure the wattage being delivered at the end of my 100 foot 16 gauge ""home depot"" orange extension cord connected to a space heater and found less than 900 watts being delivered to a load that normally pulls 1750. The voltage had also dropped below 100 volts.<p>Its possible that the Tesla simply won't charge at all if the current or voltage on the line becomes too low. In this case, it would be ""plugged in"" but not charging.<p>Edit: Lets figure it out: Range=244mi. Battery capacity=58kWh. So: 5 miles takes 1.086kWh. 10% is lost in chemical conversion so we really need 1.207kWh for those miles. We pull at a rate of 1.8kWh/h from the plug. So 600 watts or so is lost elsewhere. We know the ""always on"" battery cooling system alone takes around 150 watts. Its not that far fetched.<p>Edit: I deleted my comment below where I calculated the cost of keeping the car on standby because I don't think I made  clear enough (and didn't want to type it all twice) the difference between the actual discharge rate of the battery and the amount of power required at the charger to stop it. It just seems to take a lot of power at the charge port before any gets to the battery. The battery seems to discharge at an average rate of just 30 watts, but it seems to take a much, much greater amount of power input to prevent this and failing to provide this power has dire consequences.

People who agree with you will up-vote you, and you'll get some measure of affirmation from that.<p>The issue with that approach is that Hacker News should be a place where discussion flourishes.  If the parent had said something to the effect of ""This presents a troublesome, albeit interesting, avenue for further data aggregation, which could be used to target ads or sold to third parties,""  it would have likely kicked off an interesting discussion (both about the feasibility of such data aggregation (computer vision, mobile aggregation, etc.) and the societal costs of allowing such aggregation).<p>Instead, he went for the funny one-hitter, which framed the debate in such a way (by suggesting that it was inevitable and going to be used for evil) that anyone with even a slightly differing opinion is prevented from saying anything.<p>I don't mean to single out mechanical_fish specifically, many people here are guilty of this, but it essentially makes Hacker News more of an announcement/sharing forum (like twitter) than a discussion forum, which was one of the things that attracted me (and I'm sure many others) to it in the first place.<p>So I guess my larger point is that we should be more mindful of this stuff.

Some of the backend photo management stuff, while brilliant for 3 or 4 years ago, has been superseded by better, newer approaches -- and certain things were never good enough (geotagging photos in some areas was really hurt by the aging map interface and low quality imagery). And the photo views were getting far too small on today's modern displays.<p>So I welcome this change, even if I feel nitpicky about some of the particulars. It means that Yahoo is stating their intentions to keep Flickr going -- I suspect this is in no small part to the paying customers.<p>Now I only hope two things:<p>1) This isn't a one off, that they continue to work the design so that it doesn't die right out the gate, and long standing problems don't get left around.<p>2) They update the flickr uploading app. The ancient app is positively ancient, and a buggy mess, but it's still better than the web interface.

It's not so hard.<p>There are a few scenarios that might seem bad. If you're trying very hard to make an impression, it can make the situation unnatural and you won't feel comfortable either. Another reason might be feeling disappointed if the other person is not attracted to you.<p>I'm quite talkative and interested in many subjects though. If the other person plays along normally, it's easy to get laid back interaction. It would have been much harder to go on dates when I was 18. And probably the ""opponents"" have improved a lot too.<p>I also respect other people's right to not be interested in me. We all have our own lives.<p>For me the worst part is the early part when you're supposed to get some response out of the women, to get them to meet you in person. The yield is so low that it often feels like it's not worth the effort.<p>I think I've gotten myself motivated when thinking of it as meeting a random, likely nice and potentially interesting person. And both of you can decide what happens after that. Most likely not much. But even then it's been a quite pleasant experience compared to sitting at home on a computer.<p>Of all the people I've met through internet dating, I've ended up dating with one, am friends with many and don't keep contact with a few. But all have been positive experiences.<p>If I reverse the ""filter"" idea and think about the women that have had the most influence on me, I'd say it'd be pretty hard to separate them from a general mass of good people. So the filtering has probably a really low probability roof.<p>In keeping with the reverse problem theme, one could of course try the Bayesian approach. You take people who you know match and examine what makes it so you get a probable model. And then apply that model to unknown people. There are probably some general models (people like this are attracted to people like that) but also person specific models (this person is attracted to people like this).",1329878056

3619062,comment,3618519,3618835,3,0,leeb,,,"I guess I see a few major differences between this and friend-of-friends.  Most important is accountability - a friend-of-a-friend isn't likely to send me a creepy/sexual messages, since there would probably be social consequences for them from mutual friends.  There's no such social barrier for people I don't know at all, so the only consequence would be me blocking/reporting them (and you can easily make a new Facebook account if that happens).<p>For members of groups who I might not know - yes, people in groups I'm in know my full name, but probably don't know enough about my life to make it worth behaving creepily towards me - and if they did, any actions would likely remain virtual.  However, your service is telling people my full name, <i>and</i> states that it will ""sort by location"" - so now someone knows my name, knows around where I live, AND knows that I am single (so it's more likely that I'm not living with a male)?  That's not information that I'd feel comfortable broadcasting to people who have no accountability.<p>I know I'm focusing on the creeper/stalking issue, and I'm sure that's frustrating feedback when the majority of your users will be using this service with honorable intentions.  I'm just trying to explain why I and most of my female friends would be instantly turned off by a service that shares this information - and from what I've read, attracting female members is a huge issue in the online dating space.  It's really something you should try talking to female friends/family members/a focus group of potential online daters, because I don't think it would be an uncommon point of view and you don't want it to keep people from joining your site.",1329876837

3619045,comment,3618519,3618519,25,0,nhashem,,,"Online dating is a sausagefest.  It's the biggest sausagefest ever.  I'm not basing this on any scientific or quantitative information at all, just my own personal experiences from online dating from 2004-2008, the end of which was when I met my now-fiancee.<p>The ""sausagefest syndrome"" is inherently why so many online dating sites suck.  Guys sign up and get barely any responses to their profiles or messages.  Girls sign up and get immediately overwhelmed with messages, some interesting but the rest mostly boring or creepy.  Guys get frustrated at the lack of traction and leave.  Girls get overwhelmed by too much attention and leave.  It doesn't help when the online dating sites start using fake profiles and pictures to give the false illusion it's not a sausagefest.<p>I've seen friends sign up for Match.com and be like, ""this sucks, they have no matches for me,"" and then I find they're looking for half-Asian half-Russian college-educated non-smoking dog-owners in a 2.5 mile radius, or something like that.  That's almost guaranteed to not work.  Unfortunately the alternative is some sort of ""shotgun strategy,"" which if done poorly, means sending a message to 50 girls with the same copy-pasted canned sentences, which only contributes to the women being overwhelmed.  You still need to aim the shotgun.  I effectively had a routine where I'd spend an evening looking through profiles, only ruling out absolute deal-breakers, and then sent a message that while mostly short, at least made some reference to the actual girl.  Out of 20 messages I'd get like 5 responses, which would lead to 2 phone calls, and probably 1 actual date.  Rinse, repeat.<p>Yeah, it's kind of annoying to fill out a profile and all that, but to me that's never been the problem.  I feel there's a lot more social friction to get women to sign up for these sites, because while online dating to guys is basically, ""well, why not, it's another possible way to meet girls,"" to girls it's, ""this is admitting I am incompetent at/undeserving of finding love.""  Until that's overcome, online dating will always be a poor experience for a lot of people that try it.<p>How do you overcome it?  In a drunken night with friends a couple months ago, I started rambling about an online dating site that <i>embraced</i> the male-female disparity, and basically would pair up something like 3-4 guys to every girl, and set up dates where you'd all go out like ""The Bachelorette.""  There's a lot of reasons why that idea would be a hard sell, but if anyone ever does successfully do it, just make sure to give me my cut[0].<p>[0] <a href=""http://xkcd.com/827/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/827/</a>",1329876605

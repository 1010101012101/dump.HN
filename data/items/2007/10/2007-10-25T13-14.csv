I think we're all afflicted with it to some extent because we're invested in this community, so we kinda like to catch-up on the going-ons of our community.  However, if it's taking over to the point that you can't get work done, that should indicate that whatever your startup is just isn't interesting to you, or has no meaning.  Ideally, your startup idea should be something you're glad you did on your deathbed.  Otherwise, you might as well work for someone else.<p>Sometimes, I forget why what I'm working on has any meaning.  It's easy to get lost in the details.  That's why it helps to write down a clear and concise vision, so you can refer back to it.<p>That said, you just have to know how you work best.  block hacker.news when you work best.  open the floodgates when you have your low points in the day.  It's different for everyone.  ",1193320269

People click on them because in some cases, they are what they wanted to find.<p>Facebook advertising 'Axe' in my minifeed (Which is supposed to tell me whats going on with friends etc), is totally wrong. It's like a popup. It's in no way relevant.
No one will click on it/care about it, and it'll just drive users away to whatever's next.",1193319864

72482,comment,72056,72256,0,0,Goladus,,,"It's really hard to tell what he's getting at with that comment.  It appears that there is a stated goal of making it a 'systems' programming language, suitable for replacing C and C++.  <p>Based on features such as the ability to write source code in 6 different character formats, it doesn't seem like the sort of features he's talking about imply sacrificing anything in the language.<p>It probably means things like this (<a href=""http://www.digitalmars.com/d/lex.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.digitalmars.com/d/lex.html</a>)<p><i>Complex literals are not tokens, but are assembled from real and imaginary expressions in the semantic analysis:</i><p><p><p><p><p><pre><code>       4.5 + 6.2i		// complex number
</code></pre>
Stuff that is invisible to a programmer.  (This was a completely random example, I don't know whether it's really such an optimization or not.)<p>One reason to make a compiler easy to write is that it makes the language more portable, which is an important feature of a low-level systems language.  Low level languages are more difficult to make portable.  One of the reasons the original C was so successful is that it was (relatively) easy to implement a compiler for your architecture.",1193319346

72476,comment,72056,72056,0,0,coffeeaddicted,,,"""In D, objects are always allocated on the heap. ... <snip> ... So you can eliminate the -> operator. It's always obj.property and your code becomes that much easier to read.""<p>I think one of the best reasons still to use c++ is your control over memory and the speed which you can only get when allocating objects on the stack. Maybe that was the sort of problem he was fighting with in c++, but for me it's an argument which would make D a worse choice than c++ for those tasks where I would use c++ now.

72475,comment,72231,72331,0,0,goofygrin,,,"Really a lot of my pain is the IDE (eclipe is a step back from something like VS.NET 2k5 with Resharper, come on ctrl-tab doesn't work!), but some of the things feel half baked (if you are doing ""code behind"" components, you have to name them different things since there's no concept of partial classes or even files with the same name, but different extensions (mostly because the .mxml is compiled to .as3 with the same file name I think)).<p>You end up having to write a lot of custom controls simply because the ones built in are great for rapid POC type stuff, but aren't necessarily what you want for your ""real"" app.  Then you're just trading one set of community developed stuff for another.<p>I also looked at OpenLazslo and it's pretty neat, although it's lack of IDE, community support and the fact that it's stuff crashed my system a bunch (nothing like having to install tomcat on a vista box) turned me off (the ol site was down while I was testing it, and has been down numerous times when I've been demoing it, so that's a huge problem).",1193318397

What he is talking about is Pythagorean triples. Well, maybe. Energy, for example, does not have to be an integer, so it's not really about Pythagorean triples. What is the point?",1193318321

There could be a great deal of discrimination in this sector, and realistically there probably is. Alternatively, one could argue that something about our system of education and upbringing does not encourage women and non white/asian students to actively seek out jobs in that arena or to try and get seed funding for a company. Maybe I&#x27;m being ignorant here, but I feel like at this level, especially with the insatiable demand for real talent in silicon valley, this might be a bigger and more societal issue than just &quot;Google et al discriminate against X.&quot; There is more that can and should be done to encourage diversity in the tech sector.",1419666739

See the long discussion at the end of this article [1] with an expert on treating trauma survivors for details. An interesting quote from him:<p><pre><code>   The media should actually – quite the contrary…\n   Instead of encouraging a culture of avoidance,\n   they should be encouraging exposure.\n\n   Most trauma survivors avoid situations that remind\n   them of the experience. Avoidance means helplessness\n   and helplessness means depression. That’s not good.\n\n   Exposure to trauma reminders provides an opportunity\n   to gain control over them. This is the essence of the\n   treatment that we are using to help trauma survivors.\n   It involves encouraging the patient not to avoid\n   reminders of trauma, but in fact to make a point of\n   exposing themselves to reminders of trauma so that\n   they can develop a tolerance.\n\n   I liken it to a vaccination. You get a small dose of\n   the virus so that the body can develop immunity towards\n   it. Psychologically it’s the same phenomenon.\n</code></pre>\nHere&#x27;s another article that discusses five studies relevant to trigger warnings [2]. A couple interesting quotes:<p><pre><code>   Trigger warnings are designed to help survivors avoid\n   reminders of their trauma, thereby preventing emotional\n   discomfort. Yet avoidance reinforces PTSD.\n</code></pre>\nand<p><pre><code>   Many women who have experienced sexual assault reject the\n   label victim in favor of survivor. But although the latter\n   term connotes empowering agency, having trauma become central\n   to one’s identity bodes poorly for one’s mental health.\n</code></pre>\n[1] <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/11106670/Trigger-warnings-more-harm-than-good.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/11106670/Trigger-wa...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.psmag.com/navigation/health-and-behavior/hazards-ahead-problem-trigger-warnings-according-research-81946/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psmag.com/navigation/health-and-behavior/hazards-...</a>",1419666208

I guess once you have a big fat memory subsystem on-die, everything else is diminishing returns?</i><p>I don&#x27;t find that to be true.  As Andrew is saying, the performance characteristics only look similar because the software is rarely written to optimize performance on modern processors.  I have a 5-year old overclocked Nehalem that can beat most current Haswell&#x27;s on single-threaded code of this sort just because of the higher clock speed.  But for algorithms designed for the capabilities of the newer instruction sets, the different generations really start to distinguish themselves.<p>Instead of ~5% improvements between Intel generations on standard benchmarks, you can sometimes get 50% or more for architecture specific algorithms.  From Nehalem to Sandy Bridge to Haswell, the maximum per-cycle reads from L1 has gone from 16B to 32B to 64B.  This means that approaches that would have been silly 5 years ago (like 16KB lookup tables from which you need to read 32B every cycle to sustain throughput) can be practical now.",1419666089

MVP, if you like.<p>3) Take this requirements and write an automated test at the highest level of abstraction possible. It should almost read like the MVP requirement you just formulated. That doesn&#x27;t have to mean BDD, just something you can read easily.<p>4) Implement until the test passes.<p>5) Go to 2.<p>What I&#x27;ve found over the years is:<p>- Quickly reaching milestones of utility are key for keeping motivation while working. This is obvious, of course.<p>- The written down vision brings the motivation and big picture plan back when picking things up: Get your blood pumping again!<p>- The automated tests help keep implementation going when your drive falters. What should I do know? You should just make the test pass. Nothing harder than that. No need to think super hard. Just try to make it pass.<p>- The automated tests help you get hacking again without the immediate fear of breaking things: Get the ball rolling again, quickly and easily!<p>- The automated tests also serve as your requirement specification so far: You can easily see what already works.<p>Side projects are so important, and one should make it as easy as possible to sustain and restart them!

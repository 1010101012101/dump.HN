I've always been an extremely finicky eater where one persons half (or sometimes less) portion would be more then enough for me.  I can think back to multiple nights where I'd get the picture of a system in my head.  I could sit down, and code all night.  The next morning I'd wake up feeling great, and my apartment would be sparkling clean (I had this habit of roaming the place cleaning while I considered the best ways to write a component) Anyways that was before I turned 21.  After I turned 21 I started to slow down, where as I used to get into that ""zone"" some times 4 times a week, i'm lucky to get it once a month.  I always seem to walk around feeling as if my head is filled with air, but yet still feels like an extra 50lbs.  In addition I also gained 20lbs, my appetite changed dramatically.  I went from easting only because I have to, to becoming obsessed with it.  There is some good news though, I recently started to drastically reduce my beer consumption at the beginning of July.  The last 2 days I have enjoyed 2 very productive days, I have also lost about 10lbs, and I'm almost back to my old low appetite self.<p>On the note related to the thread below, my rs4680 is AA.",1279461233

1525746,comment,1524757,1524757,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I am currently taking provigil (the drug in the article) because I have a sleep disorder. Not just insomnia or some bullshit like that, but a serious medical condition. During the consultation with my doctor we decided on using the drug, partly because I had heard about it here and then ran across it again when researching my condition. It seemed like it could both help my medical problem and also more directly help me in my job performance, so it was a double-win.<p>After 60 days, off and on (I discontinued use at random intervals to make sure I wasn't becoming a junkie), I have a mixed bag to report. On the good side, there is no doubt in my mind that for folks who have sleep problems or are ADHD that this is a really good thing. It improves both focus and creativity, it allows you to be more in control of what you are doing. Best of all, it's not speed.<p>For regular people? I don't know if I would mess around with my brain chemistry so much if I didn't have to. I found the drug to be so effective -- and with a very slight worrying hint of euphoria attached to it -- that it really continues to bother me about addiction and side effects. There is no such thing as a free lunch.<p>Which brings me to the bad part. After several weeks of stopping and starting, I found the stop-go process was introducing terrible nausea and headaches. So a couple of weeks ago we sat down and decided that it's either all-in or nothing-in. Since the difference with the drug was noticeable and needed, I am taking it continuously for a month or so and then we'll re-evaluate.<p>There <i>is</i> a bounce-back with provigil. You stop taking it after prolonged use? Be prepared to spend a few days under-stimulated and in a fog while your brain chemistry re-adjusts. If I didn't need the drug for other reasons, and if I were of a mind to take brain-enhancers, this bounce-back alone would be enough to give me serious pause. My advice for a 20-something is to learn to exercise everyday and control what you eat -- I know from experience that a normal person can gain this same effect through hard work.<p>Couple of notes. First, if you buy this drug in the states be prepared to get screwed by Big Pharma. They charge something like 15 bucks for a pill, simply because they know lots of knowledge-workers can afford it (in my opinion). Buy overseas and the price drops to a couple of bucks. The markup here is crazy high.<p>Second, as noted, there is a mood-elevation effect with provigil. Not a peaking/tweaking/euphoria kind of thing, but a long-term I'm-happier-now-in-general kind of thing. If you're older than 25 or so, you might experience a slow, growing bit of low-level depression that occurs very slowly over many years. I know many of my friends have. I never thought I did. But after taking provigil for a couple of weeks, I realize that my mind is performing now in the same way it used to, many years ago. I guess the change is so slow over the years that it is unnoticeable for some? So it makes for a great A/B test of where your mood is.<p>Also, I <i>suspect</i> that provigil is the best adult ADHD drug on the market today for knowledge workers, hence all the interest. But it's not been tested in this role, so you're just on your own. Not a good spot for somebody with serious ADHD to be in, but there it is. (and that's just my guess, like I know anything)",1279460419

1525709,comment,1524171,1524171,0,0,fezzl,,,"Personally, our way of saving money is to pretend that we didn't have any money, especially when we were still building the product.<p>Scenario 1: we once thought we needed more developers to build our minimum viable feature set ""on time."" Since we pretended that we had no money (which isn't far from the truth anyway), we worked on improving our productivity, doing away with fluff features, and eliminating all non-productive uses of our time. That has helped us tremendously both in terms of building a product that is easy to understand as well as enhancing our work ethic.<p>Scenario 2: time to get some Beta users. If we weren't treating money in the bank as hands-off money, we would've splurged on some AdWords (which may or may not help us get the users we want). Instead, we worked with no cash (literally zero dollars) and tried to acquire early users using the basics: direct marketing, inbound marketing, social media activity, etc. That forced us to be creative.<p>Fundamentally, the best way to save money is to deceive yourself, as best as possible, that you have no money to spend -- that it's hands-off money, unless the company absolutely, absolutely needs the money and there is no other alternative. We had alternatives, so we skipped the spending. Not saying that this approach is optimal, but it sure keeps cash where it belongs: your bank account.",1279458836

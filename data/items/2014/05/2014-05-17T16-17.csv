7760583,comment,7760394,7760525,11,0,jerryr,,,"I have a Vita, but the only game I&#x27;ve played that uses it is Tearaway. This game doesn&#x27;t use it for precision navigation or selection, so it&#x27;s hard to say how well a rear touchpad would work for that. Tearaway employs the rear touchpad for tapping to jump and pushing objects around. For that, it&#x27;s surprisingly effective and adds a fun--if gimmicky--element to the gameplay. The Vita is quite a bit larger than most smartphones, and I could see problems with differing hand sizes requiring people to adjust their grips to use its entire surface--probably not as much of a problem on a phone. The Vita is played two-handed. I think a one-handed grip while using the rear touchpad on a smartphone would be more difficult as your finger&#x27;s range of motion is limited. The OP article seems to anticipate this by focusing on small gestures rather than ones that would take your finger across a large surface.<p>On a tangent [Tearaway Spoiler Alert]...when beginning the game, Tearaway asks you to select your skin tone from a few presets. Knowing nothing about the game at that point, I thought that was really strange. I recall thinking, &quot;I don&#x27;t really care whether my character has my skin tone...and it&#x27;s really odd that they&#x27;d presume that I would.&quot; But it turns out, that&#x27;s not what the skin tone selection was for. In Tearaway, you use the rear touchpad to punch your fingers through the paper backdrops of the game to manipulate things. The first time I did this and they showed &quot;my&quot; fingers in the game, I was startled for a split second and then laughed out loud. Screenshot of the effect:\n<a href=""http://media.officialplaystationmagazine.co.uk/files/2013/11/20131101-tearaway-review-20.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://media.officialplaystationmagazine.co.uk/files/2013/11...</a><p>It&#x27;s more magical live as your virtual in-game fingers track the position and angle (angle presumably by extrapolating based upon the current finger position and average hand size/grip) of your actual fingers surprisingly well.",1400345646
7760582,comment,7760122,7760433,4,0,lutorm,,,"I think you&#x27;re extremely optimistic with that cost estimate. The total cost of the James Webb space telescope will likely end up around $10B... and that&#x27;s a 6m or something infrared imager in LEO.<p>For a space-based interferometer mission, eLISA is a non-optical interferometer (for gravitatinal waves) with 1e6 km arms with a <i>budgeted</i> cost of 1.3B Euro. An interferometer needs to control spacing by a fraction of a wavelength, but for gravitational waves that&#x27;s like 1e9 m. Optical light is 1e-7m. That&#x27;s 18 orders of magnitude higher precision over a proposed 3 orders of magnitude larger baseline.<p>I think it&#x27;s fair to say the cost of such a mission would be &quot;out of this world&quot;, because we have no idea how to build it, and it&#x27;s not the launch cost to LEO that&#x27;s the problem.",1400345643

7760580,comment,7759238,7759441,2,0,mti,,,"To clarify some of these points further:<p>- As mentioned elsewhere in the discussion, the algorithm does have an impact on some elliptic curve-based cryptosystems, but it is an indirect one. The attack is against the discrete logarithm problem in small characteristic finite fields; that isn&#x27;t a security concern for the elliptic curve DLP (even over fields of small characteristic), except in the special case when ECDLP reduces to finite field DLP. That reduction is called the Menezes-Okamoto-Vanstone attack, and only applies to a restricted class of elliptic curves: so-called &quot;pairing-friendly&quot; curves, which are used in pairing-based crypto.<p>- In particular, the attack has no impact on even small characteristic NIST curves, or basically on any curve used for &quot;traditional&quot; (as opposed to &quot;pairing-based&quot;) elliptic curve cryptosystems, including ECDH, ECDSA, ECIES, etc.<p>- On the other hand, the paper is a <i>huge deal</i> for people interested in the implementation of pairing-based crypto / cryptographic bilinear groups, because small characteristic fields (mainly supersingular curves over GF(3^m)) were the preferred approach for implementation in hardware, and even in software if you wanted symmetric pairings. Joux&#x27;s original L(1/4) paper meant that people had to take a closer look at the trade-off between characteristic 3 and large characteristic in hardware (and it was also very important as the most significant algorithmic advance on the DLP since GNFS), but it wasn&#x27;t quite &quot;apocalyptic&quot;. This paper, on the other hand, has a quasi-polynomial attack, which means pairing-based crypto in small characteristic is dead (and more generally, symmetric pairings have become very unattractive).<p>- Whether this affects &quot;real-world crypto&quot; depends on were you set the limits of the real world.　SSL connections and credit cards are unaffected, sure, but there are limited deployments of things like group signatures that have to take a close look at the math used in their implementation.<p>- The first preprint did appear publicly last summer, so it&#x27;s true that this is not fresh news to the community, although I think it&#x27;s great that this result gets some publicity beyond academic circles (and IMHO it fully deserves its best paper award).",1400345622

That might seem a flippant answer but they had much less constraints than most animals left living today:<p>Air sacs not only allowed more efficient breathing but were also within skeletal structure, allowing for light weight strength. They also laid lots of small eggs so less reproductive investment per chick. Small heads on long necks with a sturdy body allowed long range eating without moving. With small heads and no chewing the disadvantages of long necks are well handled. For much more depth I encourage reading:<p><a href=""http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/02/25/dinosaur-reproduction-not-ancient-gravity-made-sauropods-super-sized/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/02/25/dinosaur-...</a><p><speculative As a non-expert my own guess would be some kind of food-weight advantage feedback cycle. The larger ones were not just more protected from predation but with longer reach came wider access to edible plant material. However, the larger sauropod size, coupled with no chewing and low grade of food (and probably not stones users) required larger and larger (fermenting?) stomachs to get enough energy to support their size. (not directly related but, reasoning from whales they might have even been cancer resistant. And if you consider that their size strongly suggests a &#x27;cold blooded&#x27; like metabolism, then given their size, sauropods could well have lived a couple hundred years) />",1400344870

Thought experiment: turn to your officemate and explain why you are smarter than they are - it&#x27;s not going to go well. Saying that you&#x27;re richer, thinner, or more athletic is also arrogant, but I think putting down someone&#x27;s intelligence is especially cutting.<p>I saved myself a lot of trouble in high school by never explicitly saying I was smart (even though it was obvious). If someone started shoving me and saying &quot;You think you&#x27;re smarter than everyone else&quot;, I&#x27;d say something like &quot;No, not really. I just do well in school&quot;, and they would happily go on their way. (I&#x27;m sure this wouldn&#x27;t work for everyone, and I don&#x27;t mean to generalize too much. Also, this was my actual view, not just something I said.)<p>I hypothesize based on this and other articles that Paul Graham went out of his way to make sure people knew how smart he was, which would explain why he ended up at the &quot;D&quot; table.

We often lean on the side of innateness which the theory that we want to prove has a domain whose scope is really big — &quot;innateness&quot; is the formulation of words necessary to describe the phenomenon within the speech genre underway. The point behind Chomsky sentences is that truth plays a role in language, all language, even scientific language, which is not always necessarily and sufficiently conditioned by the morphological construction presently being given attention, or what can we call an object of intention. So, the point here is that <i>lots</i> of theories exist, but regardless of their linguistic narrative, they tend to fail at larger orders of abstraction.<p>There are two absolutely perfect examples.<p>1. Most families don&#x27;t celebrate Mother&#x27;s Day.<p>2. Cross-country runners are breed, not born.<p>1 not only is a combination of both, but we behave very often as if it were false. We have such a trait in virtue of an innate quality, namely of having a mother. Yet we all learned not by any conscious effort to warn ourselves from the principle; it&#x27;s part and parcel of our &quot;innate&quot; characteristic.<p>With 2, I often hear this expressed in terms of geological factors.

Mac especially--it&#x27;s the favored platform for every developer I know except one. Yes, it&#x27;s less popular outside tech circles (probably due in part to the price).<p>Imagine this scenario: There are tons of Mac users who want to learn Haskell. They try it, but can&#x27;t install libraries. The Haskell community never hears from them; one could say the system failed silently. Meanwhile, Linux works fine, and the Haskell-Linux community keeps growing.<p>So perhaps there&#x27;s a self-reinforcing Linux-centric bias in the developer population.",1399132690

7691214,comment,7690625,7690728,3,0,wpietri,,,"I&#x27;m not sure which side you think needs justification, but a brief background:<p>The Internet started as a collection of small academic networks. Eventually, commercial providers joined in. Through a system of peering [1], we got global reachability: everybody could talk to everybody. In practice we generally had network neutrality [2], where everybody&#x27;s packets were treated fairly. This happened because there were many internet service providers, and any one of them thinking about being a greedy dick would have to consider that they were substantially outnumbered. And they&#x27;d also have to worry about customers switching to competitors.<p>But now the US internet market has collapsed to a small number of players. Most people have little or no choice. And the remaining players are either a) very large, or b) commercially irrelevant. So the incentives are different. Comcast sees a lot of money being made by Netflix and resents it. So they are basically threatening to make Netflix&#x27;s service worse unless they get paid more. And they want to be able to do that to anybody who makes a lot of money over the Internet.<p>That was previously prevented by the FCC, but no longer, because the head of it used to work for the cable companies. Comcast&#x27;s remaining competitors aren&#x27;t going to complain; the big ones see a great opportunity for a similar shakedown racket. Consumers can&#x27;t do anything, because they often can&#x27;t switch, and if they could it&#x27;s generally to some other giant.<p>So basically, the old system did work fine, it is breaking down. What almost everybody wants is to formalize the old approach, network neutrality. But Comcast, et al, have an enormous amount of money and long experience at manipulating governments, and they currently appear to be winning.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peering"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peering</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality</a>",1399132631

Touch pads, microcontrollers, ribbon cables, tons of small plastic components. None of these things are made to last 50 years and none of them will be available as replacement parts in the long term.<p>I&#x27;ve had many over the past 20 years and almost all have failed do to &quot;the board&quot; going &quot;bad&quot;, according to the repair techs. Company policy is always to replace the board, and it always is 60% of the cost of a new one, and will take 3 weeks to get, so you end up just buying a new one because you can get it installed in a day or so. And hey, new features, too.<p>Local independent shops won&#x27;t fix a blown capacitor or whatever the electronics issue is - they order the parts online. I repaired my oven once - the touchpad keys stopped responding, and I seriously doubt that in 10, 20, or 50 years that particular part will be available.<p>The fact is that simple devices are more reliable, and could be built again, to last, but people seem to buy for features.

Google Code started to steal some people away from SF, but again it was more focused on project hosting then just getting code to people.<p>Github is interesting is that the code is shown front-and-center whenever you visit a project page.  Sure there is the Readme.md and wiki stuff you can do, but it makes browsing code and project discovery very easy.  Github also made project creation and management super easy and lightweight.  The number of questions you need to answer to setup a repo is so minimal.  It gets out of your way when setting up a project.<p>I still feel like Google Code has some things going for it.

I have my own server where I have a git repo, the issues repo, and maybe a wiki repo.<p>2. My server would host semi-statically generated project browsers; source code browsers, issue browsers, etc.    Unlike when I was running Trac, I&#x27;d have no need to allow people access to my server, no need to worry about spammers, pages would be low-latency/cachable so that I can allow crawlers as well even on a very small linode host.<p>3. all of my wiki/issues/git would mirror out to github, bitbucket, and whoever else wants to participate, and updates on those sites mirror back.   I already do this now with my git repos using WSGI services and hooks.<p>4. when someone wants to post/update an issue, they link out to one of those services, or even run a local command line/GUI based issue system (wouldn&#x27;t that be great??), and everything synchronizes back.<p>The only missing link is a decent distributed issue system everyone can get behind.

My institution recently moved to Apps for Education and away from an in-house system, which I was not very happy about.  Privacy for my data (including communications with the undergrads I teach) was, and remains, one of my concerns.<p>There&#x27;s an awful lot of very slippery language in this post:<p>&quot;So, if you’re a student logging in to your Apps for Education account at school or at home, when you navigate to Google.com, you will not see ads.&quot;  Great -- but does <i>anyone</i> see ads on the google.com homepage?  Seeing ads is not the issue; the issue is how Google is collecting and processing data.  So:<p>&quot;We’ve permanently removed all ads scanning in Gmail for Apps for Education, which means Google cannot collect or use student data in Apps for Education services for advertising purposes.&quot;  I was with you until that last qualifier, &quot;for advertising purposes.&quot;  That just makes me wonder what sort of &quot;collection&quot; and &quot;use&quot; purposes Google is reserving for itself.  What&#x27;s really off the table here?  Even if &quot;ads scanning&quot; is turned off, what protections are in place to make sure that no one, including Google itself, has the ability to use the data associated with Apps for Education accounts in privacy-violating or nefarious ways?  The technology the post actually mentions, like HTTPS, is all about the channel between users&#x27; computers and Google&#x27;s servers.  But are there any protections to keep student data from being abused by Google employees?<p>This last possibility is an important one, as many of my students may one day be applying for jobs at Google.  What assurance do they have that the person who hires them or their future manager will not, in a moment of weakness, troll through their email from their undergrad days? see the photos they sent to friends? read the papers they wrote and stored on Google Drive?<p>I understand that much of the language here is probably slippery for legal reasons, and to keep the explanations simple, not because it is hiding some bad intent on Google&#x27;s part.  But good intentions are not enough when you are asking to be trusted with other people&#x27;s data, <i>especially</i> student data.",1399131316

By that time it already had printed more than 60.000 pages (judging by the test page output), and until today it still keeps churning out more and more pages at 600 DPI and less than 1 cent per page (a refurbished toner costs around 40 $ and lasts for around 7.000 pages). The printer itself is probably the sturdiest piece of equipment I&#x27;ve ever seen, weighing in at more than 10 kg and containing lots of metal parts. Comparing this with the current HP model, which consists mostly of plastic parts, still effectively prints only at 600 DPI and for which a 2.000 page toner can easily cost in excess of 80 $ kind of makes you wonder where all the R&D spending in the printer industry went to.<p>Concerning the washing machine example from the article: I still own on an old Miele Lavamat which has been in service since 1989 (!) and still works flawlessly to this day. New machines are more energy-efficient of course (saving about 50 % of electricity and water compared to the 1989 model) but seem to have a much shorter lifespan as well.<p>BTW, a while ago Arte (a French/German TV channel) showed a really interesting documentary on this &quot;planned obolescence&quot; (&quot;Kaufen für die Müllhalde&quot; - &quot;Buying for the Junkyard&quot;; unfortunately only in German and French <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVFZ4Ocz4VA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVFZ4Ocz4VA</a>).",1399129277

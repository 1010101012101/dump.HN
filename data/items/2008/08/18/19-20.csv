279597,comment,278250,279441,0,0,akeefer,,,"In my work, an IDE is beneficial in two main cases.  First of all, for someone new to a language or library, auto-complete and instant doc lookup help you figure out what's available to call and what the various methods and classes do.  That's also useful if you only use a particular library occasionally and just don't remember how it works.  Secondly, refactoring and find usages is useful if you're working on medium-to-large projects with a large number of people; on a 500k+ codebase there are probably enough methods named ""add"" that just doing a text search is going to be pretty painful.<p>The average Ruby project is probably a lot smaller than the average Java project because it's far more concise and powerful, which is a good thing and one of the huge advantages of the language.  For smaller projects, smaller teams, and expert users, the weight of managing a project in an IDE could outweigh the benefits, so I can see how plenty of people would ignore an IDE in those situations even if it were the best tool in the world, simply because it might get in the way more than it would help.<p>I think that there are other situations, primarily for working on larger projects but also for people new to the language or who use it less frequently, where the benefits of a really good IDE would still help out Ruby.<p>But I can see how there are plenty of development scenarios where even the best IDE would just get in the way, and my judgment is probably just clouded by the fact that my current working scenarios (a few million lines of Java code, 80+ developers, working infrequently enough in Ruby that I forget everything in between) are greatly aided by an IDE.  So personally my work style is now tailored to using an IDE, which slows me down when I have to shift out of that mode, and <i>I'd</i> use a great Ruby IDE instead of Emacs if one were available.  But I'll accept that other people whose work style isn't tailored to using an IDE wouldn't find it as useful.",1219087477

Many useful ideas to be found there:<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/comments/6wn6j/maintenance_work_blows_is_it_the_norm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/comments/6wn6j/maintenance_work_blows_...</a><p>The short answer is that it sounds like it's time for you to begin taking code quality seriously (better to have done so from the start, but we <i>all</i> fail at that most of the time).  Whatever your language of choice is, find the resources that cover good coding practices, and begin making use of them.  I work in Perl, and the definitive work is <i>Perl Best Practices</i> (and perlstyle covers a few bits and pieces)...there may not be such a definitive work in your preferred language, but I'm sure there's something.  JavaScript has Crockford's new book which, based on reviews, is excellent--I trust that's true, as his lectures and his website are truly wonderful resources.<p>If you don't have tests, start writing them, and including test development costs in your estimates.  If you don't have good code documentation, for yourself and future maintainers, start writing it, and including the cost of writing it in your estimates.  It doesn't take <i>that</i> much longer to write a test while you're working on a piece of code--it's fresh in your mind, so you know exactly what you need to test (or vice versa...some folks write the tests and then write the code...I flip back and forth based on whether I know how the code is going to work yet or not).",1219087289

If the lectures were all standardized at, say, 50 minutes each, then a professor that could be sped up more would take less time to get through each lecture than one who could not be sped up much at all. It's kind of like how you can read a page with lots of blank space much faster. \nOf course, it all gets muddled in the question of how much info per lecture\minute is actually best for learning, but if your goal is to get through them quickly then a speedable professor is best.",1225792242

Your friend made a smart decision, but that is also irrelevant.<p>I'll tell you a little story though. When I was in Basic, there was a time when all the trainees were gathered in the church, roughly 2,000 of us (nothing religious, just used because it was big enough to accommodate everyone). We were asked why we enlisted. Only a handful raised their hand who thought it was their ""patriotic duty."" After college, I will probably go into the Special Forces. Not for any patriotic fluff, but for the challenge, adventure, and to save people. So you shouldn't feel such a burden unless you live in a swing state. Voting for a third party is a symbolic gesture, but so is not voting at all. FWIW, I'm voting for Nader tomorrow morning.<p>The rest of your comment is ridiculous and should be read aloud before submitting<p>and proof that politics should be banned from news.yc.",1225789565

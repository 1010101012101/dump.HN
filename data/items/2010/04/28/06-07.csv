But unfortunately the regulated party has incentives to provide incentives (such as contributions to political campaigns) to gain control of the regulations.  This leads to regulatory capture that then renders the regulations ineffective.<p>In a perfect world we'd be forcing the banks right now to write down securities that took a hit, forcing them to declare losses, which would mean that they wouldn't be paying out absurd bonuses.  This would absorb the money we gave them from the bailout.  In a slightly less perfect world we'd be enacting useful regulations that would avoid this problem returning for a few decades (such as happened during the Great Depression).<p>In the real world we gave the banks a big bailout, have let them mark securities to models of their choice, and they paid themselves big bonuses on their ""profits"".  Of course they are still sitting on lots of toxic securities (like bad CMBS and the junk bonds issued by private equity) that they have not marked down yet.  When that blows up we have good odds that they'll ask for another bailout.  And the behavior of both parties says that the leadership will try to get it for them.  They nearly didn't manage to deliver it last time, and given the public outrage since, they may not be able to deliver it next time.<p>This could lead to interesting times.

1300947,comment,1300867,1300867,0,0,gizmo,,,"For many of us self-employment / entrepreneurship is not a choice, it's not something we just <i>want</i> to do, it's something we <i>have</i> to do. There is no plan B. If we have to start 10 companies and fail 10 times, then so be it. Self-destructive as that may be.<p>So when somebody decides to get a regular job after all, I won't think less of him. I will wonder though... ""maybe he wasn't <i>one of us</i> after all, maybe it was just a hobby, an experiment"". Maybe you were just bicurious.<p>Having no respect for regular employees makes no sense, because you need them to turn your vision into reality. And employees with an entrepreneurial mindset are often worth their weight in gold. I don't know any real entrepreneurs who dismiss employees as mindless sheep.<p>(I realize I'm not speaking for everybody. Take what I write with a grain of salt.)",1272437885

We were just trying to get the codes bases up to current corporate standards so that we could then have a solid foundation for future improvements. It's tough to stay motivated on a mind-numbing (but necessary) task like that, so having another programmer right there helps to keep both on track. Plus it's easy to make a subtle mistake that wouldn't be obvious in a code review later, so another pair of eyes watching the refactoring live was helpful for catching unintended changes.<p>I've tried it in other circumstances as well but it ended up seeming like mostly a waste.",1272437531

As I was reading through the differences in China vs. the US, I was struck by the similarities to Japan as well. People are much more risk-adverse here and having a startup, to put it mildly, is not usually a source of pride, at least until you have serious funding. This also makes it difficult for B2B startups to gain traction.<p>A friend of mine told me that Japanese companies look for the following in vendors: 1. have they IPO'd? if not then, are they 2. funded by a big VC? and, failing that, have they at least 3. won some award?<p>It all comes back to a lack of desire to reward innovation despite its obvious risks and wanting to play it safe by requiring external validation.<p>This can be good, in a way, because it forces entrepreneurs who still decide to operate in this environment figure out the needs of what we in the US would call the ""late-majority"" on the technology adoption curve (which is also usually about half of the largest part of any given addressable market).<p>I'm guessing (though only guessing) that some of these things are also true in China.

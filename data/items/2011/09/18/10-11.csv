3009964,comment,3009685,3009813,3,0,rtuck,,,"I've been looking into a few ways to do exactly that with Raphael. The short answer is that it's possible but a little tricky. I've found three methods so far:<p>1) If you're using a browser that supports SVG (basically, not IE), Raphael will generate the images as SVG nodes in your DOM tree. You can just grab that entire section of the DOM and send the SVG markup to the server where you render it using the image library of your choice.<p>2) If you have to support IE the above method won't work. Only IE9 has any SVG support and I've heard reports that it's spotty. In these cases, Raphael falls back on VML, an older MS extension that provides more or less the same experience. Unfortunately, I don't know of a server side generation library that supports VML. What's worse, in my testing, IE won't even print the VML image so you can't even use a PDF writer in the browser.<p>So, the simplest workaround is use the VML fallback in IE for display but when the user wants to download a final version, generate the same drawing as HTML + Javascript on the serverside and then use wkhtmltopdf on the html. (For those who don't know, wkhtmltopdf is an awesome tool that uses a headless webkit browser to convert HTML files to shockingly good PDFs).<p>As long as the javascript is triggered on load, wkhtmltpdf will include it in the resulting pdf. This doesn't always work perfectly but odds are it'll work for you.<p>As an added bonus, SVG bits also seemed to be rendered as vector in the actual PDF. This also prevents any chance of the server side image rendering slightly differently from the user preview.<p>3) If the wkhtmltopdf method isn't rendering properly or is too exotic for your server, you can try using the great raphael.serialize plugin ( <a href=""https://github.com/jspies/raphael.serialize"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jspies/raphael.serialize</a> ). This works around the SVG/VML problems by exporting the data as a JSON structure. This can be re-rendered inside raphael easily but exporting to PNG is trickier. You can convert the JSON to SVG and render that as in method one, Ben Barnett has a small code example on how to do that: ( <a href=""http://www.benbarnett.net/2010/06/04/export-svg-from-raphael-js-to-create-a-png-bitmap/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.benbarnett.net/2010/06/04/export-svg-from-raphael...</a> ) but there's no complete library for doing this yet so you'll have to write some extra bits yourself. If you do write a library for this, please open source it so I don't have to do it too. ;)<p>Also, Raphael 2.0 is being launched at jsconf.eu next month so it may have a more clever approach for this but I haven't looked into it yet.",1316343393

Once a copy is made of the data, the guarantee that a transaction can succeed or the data remains correct is no longer valid.<p>Considering Fowler spent years pushing ORM's, isn't it a little ironic that his first law, directly from PoEAA is [1] ""Don't distribute your objects"" yet an ORM encourages distribution via the Unit of Work pattern and local stateful copies.<p>Technically, the only thing that is possible to work for a Object-oriented database is a shared heap, which comes with its own bag of concurrency problems.<p>Relational databases however, have first class concepts within mathematics such as sets and all operations take place in one place against one true source always so transactions can be guaranteed.<p>ORM's are a recent invention and for some of the really big stuff out there, they just don't cut it.<p>I'll post some example cases where transactions and OO falls over if anyone is interested.

3009946,comment,3007615,3009833,1,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Exactly, encapsulation as a combination of data and methods makes no sense if data is transformed, joined in different ways, grouped, etc. Some methods have to become invalid. Others, like accessors, may still be logically valid but are lost because they are linked inextricably to a class type even though they may depend only on the attribute value itself.<p>The goal of a query is not to process sets of objects. The goal is to answer a question. The ORM gives you two choices. Either limit yourself to answers that can be expressed as objects of existing classes or get something that is fundamentally different from all other domain objects - a generic tuple of values.<p>You lose the homogenous, recursive transformation capability that the relational model provides.<p>In terms of simplicity, I suggest you take a few queries involving joins, group by, having and aggregates and translate them to procedural code. I've done that a lot. It's very eye opening. Functional languages using homogenous data structures like lists or generalized sequences can be similarily productive for data that fits into memory. That is a more and more viable alternative to SQL in my view, but OO systsms and querying/transformation just clash badly.",1316342205

I am trying to find out how people who do a lot of research online manage their bookmarks and if my extension may be useful to them.<p>The main idea is to save a bookmark with minimum interruption and later find it easily.

Both saving and finding bookmarks is fast and my research is not interrupted.<p>I uploaded my extension to Chrome store to be used by invitation only but I don't know how to find people who may be interested in this extension and be willing to beta test it.<p>I placed questions in google app engine and chrome extensions groups but so far no replies.

Being a front-end/back-end combo, we had little ""healthcare"" experience, but we thought that we could make it work.  We realized we would eventually need to bring on someone with healthcare experience.  We did this about a year into the company when we brought on a very well known figure in the Health IT world as a part-time ""co-founder"".  Among other roles, he is a practicing physician.  At the time, although he was not working full-time, we decided to give him founder equity in the company.  Everything would be split three ways - 33%.  We viewed his part-time efforts as being acceptable because he was in the field, figuring out the problems in healthcare...<p>Since then everything has been going well.  Myself and my original co-founder are working full-time on the company, we pushed out a successful beta, have a paying enterprise customer, etc.  The doctor co-founder has been proving his worth - he is actively involved in the product, helped us sell to our first enterprise customer (gave the presentation), has been tracking down new leads, and has been talking with potential investors.<p>That said, some of the investors we have been talking with are seriously hung up on the fact that we have three founders and only two of them are working full-time, going as far as saying that this would turn many off from investing.  The way we see it, he has been crucial to our success thus far even though he is only working part-time.  He provides a role that we could never do (be a doctor).<p>Will our cap table, as it currently stands, cause us to be unable to get investment?

But, Extend is different in that it generates Java code instead of JVM. So, I'm wondering who will use that.<p>- Java programmers who are still stuck with old version: Even though they'd dream about using this, I'm guessing that won't compile to java 1.4/1.5.. right?<p>- Java programmers who already switched to high level language on top of jvm (Scala, clojure, etc.): Maybe the few who are still with Eclipse would switch back.. but I guess the majority of programmers in this scenario wouldn't want to switch.<p>- Java programmers who refuse, for various reasons, to learn newer languages/tools: Since it's still Java.. and still in Eclipse, it might be easier for them to give it a try? But then, if they refused to switch to newer language, it might be surprising to see them switch to Extend.<p>I'm a bit puzzled (as you can see).

I guess they would have to spend some time drawing a completely custom button.<p>* The largest UI element is the number of seconds that have elapsed in the current song. Is this really something that people care about?<p>* Sorting by artist seems to be broken - if I sort by artist, it should logically order each artist's albums alphabetically as well. I'm not sure what secondary ordering its actually using - it's not alphabetical by track or ordered by track number (all 1, all 2, ...). iTunes calls the manner of sorting that I suggest ""album by artist"".<p>* Scrolling is broken (not smooth). This is also an issue in Spotify.<p>* For some reason there is a prominent button to show the ""About"" dialog.<p>Good things:<p>* When the track changes, this list doesn't snap back to the new song. This is one of the most annoying features in iTunes.<p>* When the track changes, if you have searched for something, it doesn't just <i>stop</i> like iTunes. In iTunes, if you start playing a Beatles song, then search for ""The Clash"", if that Beatles song ends, it will not go to the next Beatles song, because the original song is no longer visible.<p>* Watch folders, which, if it wasn't ugly, would be reason enough to use it.",1320444061

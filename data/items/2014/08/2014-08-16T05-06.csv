But I hope you can empathize with the fact that anyone in any situation can become unhappy and want to feel happy and fulfilled again. So, hear me out.<p>I need change. I&#x27;m not burned out. I&#x27;m bored, maybe. Confused, perhaps?<p>Problem 1: My comp is high (total comp > $200k last year), to the point where almost anywhere else I go will be a step down I feel. Having said that, I know if I randomly jump ship to another BigCo, I will keep that comp at least the same, and also pull down probably close to $100k in signing bonuses. So do I just bounce somewhere to pick up a pile of money?<p>Problem 2: My seniority is decreasing &quot;hands on keyboard&quot; time, which is what&#x27;s made me happy since I started programming in second grade. So I feel like my reward for accomplishment is to diminish what makes me happy. Some weird version of the Peter principle...<p>Problem 3: I literally have no idea what I want to work on. I&#x27;ve worked on lots of different things over the years, and I&#x27;m at the point where I look at the landscape out there - and it&#x27;s just &quot;meh&quot;. I don&#x27;t see much changing on a day to day basis from where I&#x27;m at now. Nothing is exciting me.<p>Problem 4: I don&#x27;t want to go into management, and I&#x27;m having a hard time understanding how to grow anymore as a developer.<p>Has anyone ever been here before? How did you get out? The tl;dr is &quot;don&#x27;t find satisfaction in what I&#x27;m working on, look around, don&#x27;t find anything appealing or any motivation to choose one thing over another.&quot; Is that it, have I just arrived at my professional plateau?<p>Help!",1408168598

If you think the purpose of math is merely to provide humans with intellectual stimulation then yes, it makes sense to optimize the nation for human consumption.  But if you think that math is actually good for something besides being a distraction from existential despair then rendering math for human consumption might not be the thing you want to optimize for.  Instead you might want to use a notation that, while it can be rendered for human consumption, isn&#x27;t <i>optimized</i> for that, but is instead optimized for, say, automated error detection, or automated compilation into some other form, like an executable program or a design for an FPGA.<p>The closest I can come to an analogy in the horse/car world is that in the horse world it makes sense to dispense water in troughs to make it easy for horses to drink.

8185470,comment,8182553,8185403,2,0,malandrew,,,"Yes, I absolutely understand that. I&#x27;m talking about one level lower than what web components will enable. I talking about the notion of how we got to the current details regarding web components (I&#x27;m hesitant to use the term &quot;spec&quot; since it lends more officialness than there actually is. The entire foundation and architecture of web components has been rushed and there have been attempts to foist that specific feature upon the web without adequate time for others to question its design and direction.<p>There is a huge difference between the polyfill that is Polymer and the W3C Web Components specification.<p>The former is a polyfill that developers can only rely on if they explicitly include it as a dependency in their project. The latter is a feature that is (or at least should be) baked into the current version of every modern web browser out there.<p>The former conveys an architectural design decision that you must consciously make and that there may be other legitimate alternatives (known and unknown) that you may want to consider instead of the one you&#x27;re familiar with. The latter conveys that there is one true way of accomplishing task/need X and to stray from using that standardized feature is only for either heretics or the brave.<p>The former creates a scenario that promotes a proliferation of alternatives. The latter squanders the intellectual capacity of the community with respect to a specific problem that is &quot;officially solved&quot;.<p>To declare a &quot;problem officially solved&quot; with an inadequate solution is professional malpractice, IMHO.<p>The issue I&#x27;m talking about here was the fiasco earlier this year where the Chrome team announced the intent to ship web component features <i>without the use of a developer flag</i> despite the fact that the feature that was not defined in a w3c spec draft much less a mature spec[0]. When you have the market share that Chrome has, shipping without requiring a developer flag is tantamount to saying &quot;Standards schmandards!

That people act out of self-interest (whether being a manager in a capitalist system or volunteering in a hospital in North Korea). This is a rule that&#x27;s true &quot;on average&quot;, not absolutely, but it is true in the overwhelming majority of cases you&#x27;ll look at.<p>That means &quot;evil&quot; barely ever happens. There are very, very few people who hurt others knowing they&#x27;ll also hurt themselves in the process (there are, in theory they should be confined to insane asylums). This suggests it&#x27;s at least a Nash balance.<p>Almost all people who commit bad acts do so because they are expected a benefit in return. Murder, theft, rape, hell, even suicide bombing ... all come with a benefit to the perpetrator. This makes their actions fit your description of &quot;amoral&quot;.<p>The opposite of good is not your definition of evil. That&#x27;s merely insanity. I&#x27;m not saying that never happens, but it very rarely do. The opposite of good is your definition of &quot;amoral&quot;, and because of that it makes a lot of sense to call anything amoral evil.<p>Having some machine learning experience I might also mention that I&#x27;ve noticed on easy communality in evil versus good. There is this concept of &quot;time horizon&quot; of decisions. Because predicting the world is a cpu and memory expensive process, when evaluating a decision people only simulate X time out. X is called the time horizon. If there is a decision that will have good effects for X-1, and cause a disaster at X, they will make that decision. What we call evil can, to some extent, be simplified as being a &quot;decision with low time horizon&quot; and good is the opposite. Hell, what most saints did can be summarized as making decisions where the time horizon is far longer than their lifespan, which doesn&#x27;t make sense for most people.<p>Alternatively one could say that you&#x27;re trying to let companies get away from being called &quot;evil&quot; by taking a far extreme and then showing that they don&#x27;t satisfy that standard. That you are presenting a &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; fallacy.",1408165382

We've been married almost 10 years, have a kid, and presently live below the poverty line; we've also had very close friends in extremely dire financial situations.  Please stop making assumptions about our experiences.<p>> <i>""$5,000 is about the cheapest you're gonna get without having trouble within the first year""</i><p>How much trouble is $325/month worth?  If you get an $800 car from the classified ads and it works for 3 months,  you're already ahead; if it works for a year and only requires $500 in work you're way ahead.<p>If you're as poor as the above scenario presumes, you shouldn't be spending $325/month on a car.  Either get one you can pay for up front (yeah, it's going to be a POS; welcome to poverty), find a way to finance a solid car from a reputable source (a brand new economy car, at a crappy rate with nothing down because you have terrible credit, will run you less than $300/month; the 3-year-old model is less), or find a way to get a ride/take the bus/ride a bike and save some money.<p>You can push and tweak and justify all you want, trying to explain why the spending in this scenario is realistic -- but when the spending is higher than what I spent when I was poor and also higher than when I was financially very well off, I just don't buy it.  It goes back to the initial point -- if you're really that poor, what are you doing spending $500/month between your car, phone, and pet?  If you're really poor enough that making it through the month with enough food is a struggle, those are unacceptable expenses (which most of the truly poor people I know would have already cut.)<p>I'm not saying it's easy to be poor.

3078256,comment,3078128,3078128,29,0,kristofferR,,,"""No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.<p>Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma  which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.""<p>- Steve Jobs",1317859539

3078227,comment,3076721,3076721,1,0,jackfoxy,,,"I've often been stumped why the notion of ""strong AI"" cannot be successfully refuted. On the one hand any analog system can be modeled to arbitrary precision by a digital one; and on the other hand it is also a fallacy to mistake a model for the thing itself (at least from the perspective of Aristotelian logic). The notion consciousness just arises at some level of complexity is a deus ex machina expectation, and not scientific, but this is not the argument the best proponents of strong AI put forward. Instead, I think the clincher argument itself points out the limitations of science. Science is based on observation. If intelligence is an observed phenomena (and I'm still not satisfied we have an adequate definition; it seems more of an I know it when I see it definition) then clearly, machines can be intelligent (but conscious !!??).",1317859224

First of all, most people aren't that annoyed by banner ads. Of those who are, most of them are using Internet Explorer, so they're extremely unlikely to try to install Firefox/AdBlock or find a similar solution for IE. Of the people who already use Firefox, there is a large segment that doesn't use any extensions at all.<p>I know of very few people who go around installing AdBlock on people's computers. These people would be a chunk of the same people who install Firefox, but even Firefox's market share isn't very large. Five percent or so of Firefox's ~20% market share isn't very much.<p>People who use AdBlock or are likely to in the future are a tiny segment of  users.",1176599967

If you're doing a social network (And by the way, if your social network doesn't  already have 1M members right now, please stop and find something interesting to work on-- you already missed the party)... but your niche is changing each week- one week it is cat owners, next week it is ferret owners-- you don't want to talk about it and sound like a goofball who is a member of the ""get-rich-quick-scheme-of-the-week"" club. <p>If you're really in stealth mode, you won't ever use the phrase ""stealth mode"".  You would simply not talk about it. <p>However, when talking to friends who know I'm working on something, it would be nice if there was a phrase to use that says ""it is too early to talk about right now, but I'm not trying to be pretentious."" <p>Maybe just ""early stage"" is the phrase to use. <p>As for titles, I always hated the CxO titles-- they say to me ""these are titles we give to MBA idiots cause they insist that their air of pomposity be respected, but secretly we know anyone with this title is an clueless and not worth spending time with at parties."" <p>Personally, I'm going with founder.  It is way too early to come up with a job title to specify exactly what my responsibilities are-- if it isn't done yet, it is my responsibility!<p>",1176599949

The only way to keep it secret is to never launch, and that means you don't have a business.<p>It's more important to be able to move quickly once people copy your idea and stay ahead of them.

Myspace crowd is a lot more diverse than Facebook's so Myspace performs a lot better in CPM. Monetizing smart crowd that's averse to advertising is one of the toughest problems any social site will face.

Ideas are worth next to nothing.  If you did manage to get one to join you, he'd likely leave at the first excuse.  Why?  Because you're contributing <i>nothing</i>.<p>Find some way to be of value as the startup grows.  Learn some domain knowledge about the market.  Talk to potential prospects.  There are many things a technical cofounder can't or doesn't want to do on his own, and if you do them, he'll have a reason to work with you.

13001,comment,12805,12808,0,0,BitGeek,,,"If you're running a web based business (eg: not a retailer, but where everything is an online service) then the domicile of the business is the web, not any nationality.  In other words, you can incorporate anywhere you wish and its legitimate- the act of incorporation creates the domicile for the business. <p>If you're going to do business in Japan to the point that you have above ground employees (taxes, social security, etc.) then you'll have to find out the Japanese laws. Even then it probably makes sense to incorporate outside of Japan for tax reasons.   A foriegn corporation operating in a country is generaly treated differently (and better) than a domestic corporation.<p>But, if not, then you can incorporate in any jurisdiction which is friendly to corporations.<p>I would strongly recommend you do not incorporate in the US.  The USA is not a friendly jurisdiction for corporations and all the trends are that it is getting worse.  Ths US has enacted currency controls, limiting ones ability to move money in and out of the country-- this is the first step in the creation of an ""iron curtain"".  (Requiring passports of people who travel, as the US started doing in January is the second step.) <p>It is only appropriate to incorporate in america if your business is completely located in america.  (If you want to find out what your government does all day, just file business papers in many states- over the next 6 weeks you'll get contacted by many dozens of different agencies, all of whom want you to do paperwork and give them money. Texas is an exeption to this, Nevada may be as well.) <p>Ok, on to the real advice-- look at countries that are pro-business, or who are, or used to be tax havens.  The caymen islands and bahamas are obvious choices, but also st kitts and nevis are worth checking out.  You can legally incorporate there.  Some of these islands have restrictions about the business you can operate there, but are happy to incorporate foriegn businesses (that is to say, its easier if you'll not be opening an office on their soil).<p>Along those lines- ex UK protectorates, consider the Isle of Man (or is it the Isle of Wight?) and closer to home, New Zealand and Australia.  These latter two are high tax states, but are closer and may prove to be good choices for you. <p>Also consider the united arab emerites, monaco and Mauritius.  These are a different style, but they may prove to be good places.<p>Finally, probably the best place to incorporate is Panama.  Their government is oriented around providing services to foriegn industry... starting with the canal, but also ships registry, bank registration, incorporation and trust services, etc.  This is probably one of the easiest places to do it.<p>If you're planning to bank outside of Japan, you might consider incorporating in Switzerland, so that your corporation and your bank can have closer ties.  But I haven't looked into that much. <p>Its hard to find good information on this subject, probably because US courts have thrown people in jail for giving ""Advice on how to avoid US taxes""... so, while this isn't a tax dodge (you're not a US citizen) people are wary of talking about it.<p>",1176598923
13000,comment,12988,12989,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Learn to program.  ;-)<p>Seriously, there are a bunch of reasons why coders turn down a startup:<p>1.) Not enough compensation.  If you're paying them cash, you have to pay them market rates.  For a bright but junior programmer, that's minimum $55-60K/year. salary in most of the tech hotspots.  For someone experienced, figure at least $100k/year.  If you're looking for hourly contractors, expect to pay at least $75/hour for anyone decent.  If you give them equity - well, I personally would not join a startup for less than 20% equity, and I suspect many other technical founders have similar minimums.  Actually, the only reason my current startup got away with so little (I'm getting 25%) is because it has 5 founders, and nobody else has more than 25%.<p>2.) Boring idea.  Good programmers like to work on interesting problems.  I joined my startup because it was in a problem domain that I waste a lot of time in anyways, I knew the area, and it'd let me try some cool stuff that I didn't know if I could do, but it'd be fun as hell to try.<p>3.) They don't trust you.  Techies have a natural aversion to business-type people.  Be straight with them, always.  The second they think you're trying to bullshit them, they'll walk away.<p>4.) They don't think you add much value.  Ultimately, it'll be the techie building the product.  They need a reason why working with you beats building the product on your own.  Usually, your best bet is to have a large personal network, or good people skills, or the ability to sell something.  I don't think it's necessarily true that techies can't be good with people, but in my experience, I can't code <i>and</i> be good with people at the same time, so have a cofounder with people skills has been a big win for me.<p>Remember, if you're founding a technical startup, you want the best coder you can find.  He'll usually be young, because good experienced coders typically have families and will not work for stock, and you generally can't afford the $150K/year that they'll cost you.  <i>Don't</i> try to skimp and get cheaper labor - lots of companies tried that in the dot-com bomb (notably Value America), and they almost universally went out of business.  Average coders cannot hit the high notes; you need to hit the high notes as a startup, because all of the middle ground is taken.<p>In my case, I met my cofounder at Homecoming.  We'd lived across the hall from me sophomore year, so I went over to talk to him and see what he was doing.  Turned out he was working on a startup in a field I was interested in.  He introduced me to the other cofounders afterwards (2 of which I already knew from college).  I didn't actually join until several months later, when their initial choice for a technical founder quit, but he kept my name in mind.  ",1176598918

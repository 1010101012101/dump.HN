When I was rushing through Grand Central trying to get done with my commute, I hardly paid attention to any action that would otherwise be super interesting to watch/listen to. Now, GC has a huge tourist crowd throughout the day especially this time of the year.

There were two versions, IBM and Unisys, which were mandated to maintain 100% feature parity. The reason for two versions was that the Federal Reserve System preferred not to sole-source mainframes across its 12 districts.<p>To understand ACH it helps to understand that it&#x27;s basically electronic checks.  The FRB system was (and is) the nation&#x27;s clearing house for physical checks. The people who created ACH took as their model the existing system of check processing.<p>By the time I started, a goodly portion of inbound files came  over a wire, but many (if not most) still came on magnetic tapes delivered each day by couriers. A few years earlier all files had come as magnetic tapes and (I believe) before that, punch card decks.<p>The biggest risk, and the thing we lived in fear of -- and I suppose they still do -- is a &quot;delayed file.&quot; If a file cannot be processed by the promised time because of an error in the ACH system, then the receiving accounts are not credited when they are due.  This results in &quot;float&quot; -- interest lost. This can reach into the millions, and when the Federal Reserve is at fault, they have to eat it.<p>The post talks a lot about rejections. In my day, the largest most complicated program was the &quot;The Editor&quot; which had only one job: to reject files. This beast took the form of a three inch thick green bar printout which I would remove from a hanging file folder each day.  If memory serves, about 1 out of 10 lines was GO TO.  I could wax on, but suffice to say, this drove me out of programming for 12 years.<p>When I saw this post, I had to wonder if any of the code I wrote so long ago is still running today.",1400041129

The no &quot;special&quot; characters rule, for instance, dates from a time when most web CGI code was in Perl, and with a specially constructed series of characters in a web input field, it was easily possible to &quot;shell out&quot; to the operating system and even get access to data. So security people told developers: &quot;do not allow special characters! Ever!&quot; Instead of <i>understanding why</i> this rule existed, they blindly followed the order. Over time the rule got distorted, and now, which particular set of special characters is disallowed varies from site to site.<p>The restriction on length is obviously based on confusion: a <i>minimum</i> length for a password is a good idea, but imposing a short maximum length makes no sense whatsoever.

7742121,comment,7740561,7741239,2,0,eshvk,,,"> That&#x27;s why the seemingly anti-intellectual advice of &quot;eat a variety of foods in moderation&quot; is actually quite good advice.<p>That is because it is vague, imprecise and can be defined whichever way you want.<p>For example, how much protein should a person intake? 56 gms per day as per the CDC. Other variant figures in the body building community include like 0.68 gms per kg to 2.5 gms per kg. So which figure does one use to establish the definition of moderation? Genetic and cultural differences also come into play. I have lived in cultures (Africa/Asia) where protein is expensive, eaten less. If I went with that sociological perspective of moderation, I could very easily eat less than the 56 gms of the CDC requirement. If I went with the American concept of protein, which sub population do I go with? Do I go with the traditional American eat a Burger + Mashed Potatoes erry day deal or go all Keto and eat Bacon every day?<p>Personally, I believe that one should gradually evolve towards a lifestyle that is suited to one&#x27;s own needs.",1400040176

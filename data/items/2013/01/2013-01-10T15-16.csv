5037590,comment,5037089,5037089,26,0,geophile,,,"C/C++/Java. A programmer's version of Rock/Paper/Scissors.<p>Ignoring pre-history (BASIC, FORTRAN, PDP-11 assembler, Z80 assembler, Pascal), I started out in C, many years ago. I found myself using macros and libraries to provide useful combinations of state and functions. I was reinventing objects and found C++.<p>I was a very happy user of C++ for many years, starting very early on (cfront days). But I was burned by the complexity of the language, and the extremely subtle interaction of features. And I was tired of memory management. I was longing for Java, and then it appeared.<p>And I was happy. As I was learning the language, I was sure I missed something. Every object is in the heap? Really? There is really no way to have one object physically embedded within another? But everything else was so nice, I didn't care.<p>And now I'm writing a couple of system that would like to use many gigabytes of memory, containing millions of objects, some small, some large. The per-object overhead is killing me. GC tuning is a nightmare. I'm implementing suballocation schemes. I'm writing microbenchmarks to compare working with ordinary objects with objects serialized to byte arrays. And since C++ has become a hideous mess, far more complicated than the early version that burned me, I long for C again.<p>So I don't like any language right now.",1357833578

Generally speaking, $60k income is solidly middle class, perhaps with a hint of ""upper middle class"", again dependent on the region.<p>Salaries for web programmers in the US usually cap out around $100k for the most senior guys, +-20k, depending on the region (the Bay Area being the exception, where senior-level guys will get closer to 200). Programmers who do lower level stuff (OSes, etc.) can usually expect to cap out at something like 140, +-20k.

The other two big industries are so far behind.<p>The reason seems to be exactly what you pointed out - the music industry's got a 10 year head start on this because technology arrived sooner that grew the market and pretty much forced the labels' hands.  Broadband, Napster, iPods, and the industry's ridiculous DRM responses to piracy (and the pain & suffering that came with it) led the labels to realize a common sense approach was the only thing that would save them.<p>The movie studios certainly still haven't learned this yet - I feel like we're at the point with movies that we were with music in the mid-2000s.  Those were the dark days when there were a dozen different competing DRM standards for downloads, and the record labels were releasing CDs that were deliberately damaged so as to not be rippable (or worse, that covertly introduced rootkits that interfered with access to the CDROM drive).",1357833166

Whether or not this feeling is justified is not relevant, that's how many feel about it over here right now.<p>One thing worth mentioning in this context is that the images of buildings and bridges on the notes were specifically chosen to be imaginary, instead of depicting real buildings from European countries. The rationale for this choice was that the Euro was the common currency of all Eurozone countries, and putting e.g. the Eiffel tower or the Colosseum on them might send the wrong message to people living in countries that did not have any national monuments depicted on Euro notes.

If you deform it, which is very easy, it will stay that way forever. You can't straighten it up. Notes don't stack together nicely anymore, because each note shows a different pattern of wear and tear.<p>Notes are supposed to be durable, but are extremely easy to chip on a side, and when that happens, they simply split in two. This usually happens with larger notes. When I get money from the ATM, 10% of the notes are chipped on a side and I have to use scotch tape to fix them.<p>Best note material is what dollars use.<p>Plastic notes stacks are also much harder to count fast, they don't stick to your fingers, instead they stick together.

Medium format bodies are pretty cheap, and even Hasselblad lenses aren't that bad on a software engineer's salary ($500-900-ish, unless you've got your sights set on a rare one). It's relatively cheap if you put them next to modern DSLR lenses at the same quality level (for Nikon and Canon, $1300-2000).<p>In this case, I only ever used two lenses on the Hasselblad - 80mm and 150mm, the 80mm being the ""kit"" lens and very cheap to find bundled with a used body.<p>TCO for film cameras is inevitably high - you're working with equipment at <i>least</i> two decades old, if not 3 or 4. In all likelihood nothing will go wrong, but eventually something will, and repair costs are non-trivial. If you want to shoot vintage film cameras you should hunt down some reputable maintenance people online - going to your local camera shop is a good way to pay a lot for shoddy work.<p>Film is inevitably expensive, with 120 medium format weighing in around $4-6 a roll, at 12 exposures a roll. Not a lot of room to screw up ;) Processing depends on where you live - in Seattle there used to be some inexpensive and good labs, but I believe they have mostly shut down since I moved away. You can ""hack"" processing for C-41 films in various ways via Walgreens or Wal-Mart. They are incapable of processing medium format in-house but can send it out, and they won't charge extra, though you have little control over quality then.<p>With black and white you can always develop on your own, but that requires a bit of willingness to DIY.",1357830762

This tells me there is at least a market of 1 person ;) I am quite surprised you can tell from only a couple of screenshots, MoneyMonk is a limited clone.<p>Of course there are similarities, giving the fact we target the same audience. But I really think we have a different kind of product. This sort of competition is only a good thing. It keeps us all motivated to make the best software for our customers. In the end it is the customer who wins.",1357830367

5037173,comment,5034544,5035608,2,0,jdbernard,,,">  The marriage was clearly over (despite not being officially over).<p>It is not clear that the relationship was over. A relationship involves two parties. If both parties are not clear that it is over, then it is not over. This is why formal divorce is important. It marks a clear end to the relationship with no room for misunderstanding or confusion. If they created the relationship with a formal marriage commitment then it is unethical to move on until there is a formal divorce, or at the very least a clear and communicated separation and intent to break the relationship. Now if she did everything she could to secure a divorce and he refused her, then it is a different story, but there is no evidence that this is the case here.<p>It is no longer just her choice to make. When she entered into the marriage relationship, she made a commitment to her husband. She made a promise. It is no longer just her choice.<p>This is a stretched analogy, but ethically similar, I believe: If I enter into a contract with a service provider (marriage relationship) and as part of their commitment to me they promise a certain level of service (fidelity), then they are obligated ethically to provide that level of service as long as they are within this contractual relationship. Unless we have written into the contract that either party can dissolve the relationship at any time without notice--uncommon for this kind of contract and extremely uncommon for marriage--then they are in the wrong if they choose unilaterally to end the relationship and fail to meet their committed level of service.<p>This is why adultery is often illegal. The only argument I can think of for making adultery legal is that we do not want the government this involved with people's personal lives. It may not be in fashion, but I firmly believe there is no moral or ethical justification for adultery.",1357830245

That's exactly why I've wrote this rant.<p>For example, just a day ago in the previous Lisp discussion on HN (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5031505"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5031505</a>):<p>> It's not so much a question of ""Why Lisp?"" as it is a question of ""Which Lisp?,"" if you ask me.<p>I can't imagine a similar question about C: ""Which C would you use, gcc or clang, C++ or Java?"" Can you? And that is because everyone understands what is C. Yet, I think, this understanding won't impede people from discussing something in the lines of ""Is Go an acceptable C?"" Just because C is so well understood you can clearly reason of it. But if you will say, that you use Lisp in a broad sense, this won't tell anything about your project, because it can be a very functional Clojure entangled with a lot of Java, or very academic and ""pure"" Scheme, or Common Lisp, or some obscure and very different dialect, like Nu or newLisp, or you've added your own ""Lisp"" dialect into a project... This doesn't help understanding, and it so happened, that there so many misconceptions about Lisp, that you have a hard time discussing it with people: first you have to educate them.<p>Speaking of Emacs Lisp. Indeed, it is a Lisp, and it is, actually, very similar to Common Lisp, just a more dated version, lacking some of the current Lisp features. But this case, likewise the case with AutoLisp, isn't a problem, as everyone can <i></i>clearly<i></i> draw a line between a general-purpose language and an embedded environment.",1357830198

It seems LG and Sony are just now trying to be where Apple was 2 years ago with the glass-back phones, which I think was a very poor material to use and a mistake on Apple's part.<p>I think they quickly realized that, but it took them a while to create an aluminum iPhone the right way, because as we know aluminum is not great for radio connections, so you'll have to arrange the radios in such a way that the body doesn't interfere with them, which is probably why it took them so long, and why they made the iPhone 4S identical to iPhone 4.<p>I won't even discuss Samsung, which seems to have a fetish for  crappy plastic. If it were after me, phones would all have metallic bodies, because it feels the best in hand, but you won't get full metal bodies anyway, but a mixture of metal and plastic or glass (like iPhone 5).<p>The best compromise between being easy to make and also feeling solid in hand seems to be polycarbonate right now, and more manufacturers should be using it, along with more colors for their devices, as I'm getting really bored with the black and white ""options"". It's like most of them are afraid to even try other (bold) colors, and just want to appeal to the lowest common denominator, and in the same time complain about not being able to differentiate, other than changing the skin on Android, which I think it's just an easy way out for them, instead of actually doing interesting things with their hardware design.<p>The same thing applies to Nokia, which in the past have said that they wouldn't be able to differentiate with Android, but I think a Lumia-like device would've sold a lot more units with Android. Nokia's growth is being limited a lot by WP's own growth right now. They can only grow as fast as WP is growing, and if anything, it's Nokia pulling WP after them, rather than the other way around, which just goes to show how much better it would do with Android, which doesn't need to be ""sold"" to the public anymore.",1357830061

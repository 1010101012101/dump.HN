Maybe adding some fuel to that part to make use of atmosferic oxigen to increase power. Above 30km you may drop it.\n I don't think it would be too heavy as it doesn't have moving parts. The question is if it would generate power enough to be worth all the trouble.",1354348676

So assuming a counter point of view would also be acceptable by your own process of reasoning if an anedoctal could express it. That tells me you recognize your own confirmation bias and so should I recognize mine.<p>Had the poster said ""the majority"" instead of ""almost all"" it would have been much more agreeable to my own impression and my own limited anedoctal experience wich makes up the extent.<p>But I do take your response in the same good candid nature that you meant it.

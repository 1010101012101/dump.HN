124469,story,,,2,8,ericb,"Ask YC: Monitor setup recommendations?",,"I'm buying a macbook pro (17"") tonight and looking to fix up my monitor setup. I currently have an 18 inch monitor and have never even tried a dual monitor setup.<p>I'd like to be able to easily have 2 full size windows open. I'm curious what other people have used and recommend. I'm a little reluctant to shell out the extra 800 bucks for a 30 inch cinema, but also tempted as this is the device I spend most of my time staring into. On the other hand, 2 side by side monitors might accomplish the same thing and I could buy the 23"" and set my 18"" monitor next to it. I'm wondering if two monitors better than one and if a 30"" is worth the expense. Thoughts?",1204081127

The engineers, even those with no coding experience, are writing one off scripts to solve problems and then throwing them away.  Some write 10-15 scripts a day.  All of which used to be done by IT.  Our IT department has shrunk to glorified data managers.  Make sure the data is reliable and the engineers write all the logic themselves.<p>It's much nearer than you expect.<p>It may not be agile or maybe it's the extreme of agile.<p>Our finance guys started using the scripting language just 6 months ago.<p>The requests are drying up from them as well...<p>None of the script would pass even basic IT standards, but they work.

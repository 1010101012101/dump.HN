I have run a mixed Lenny/Sid (mostly Lenny, with the occasional package pulled from unstable, currently it's all Lenny) for a long time now and not yet had a serious issue that was not my own fault.<p>Testing is also a rolling release, but you've got one more level of protection in unstable for serious stuff to get worked out before packages get to you. There is also a useful tool called apt-listbugs which will display information about serious bugs during the upgrade process before packages are upgraded and allow you one last chance to abort the upgrade.<p>It's pretty commonly thought in the Debian community that if you're running Debian on a desktop system (as opposed to a server) then there isn't much reason not to run testing.<p>I will continue to track the new testing in due time. I'm kind of going to miss Lenny though. :)",1234735062

I don't accept that all possible intelligence would try to take over the galaxy.<p>He also says that it's not in an alien's interest to leave one planet (Earth) just in case we develop - but he doesn't consider that they might have colonized the galaxy but left Earth precisely because they <i>did</i> find life on it. Even the slightly unimaginative at times Star Trek had the idea of humans only colonizing 'empty' areas and leaving anything with existing life on it alone.<p>Also, he states that colonizing the galaxy takes ~110,000 years because humans took 10,000 years to evolve + 100,000 years to cross the galaxy. He completely ignores that humans actually took many tens of millions of years to evolve <i>from scratch</i> not from existing life forms.<p>Also, he assumes zero chance of catastrophic accident leading to exctinction as an explanation for why aliens might not exist. Maybe they did exist but wiped themselves out.<p>Also, he assumes 100,000 years to cross the galaxy, but that means traveling pretty much at the speed of light, which is currently not possible/forseeably practical. Yet he doesn't consider how aliens would stay as a coherent civilization when a light speed ping response starts taking years, let alone tens of thousands of years.<p>Also, he doesn't consider any kinds of future technology, IT, AI, singularity or similar. Maybe any culture which gets a thousand years past where we are now does not become a galactic conquerer, but a Matrix-style virtual reality.<p>Lastly, what if aliens decided the best way to colonize the galaxy was to spray terraforming machines and life seeds, and we <i>are</i> the 'alien' intelligence colonies?

Ten or fifteen years ago people didn&#x27;t think about that as much, so people used Mathematica happily.

While the limitations are easy to see when you mod it, you can still hit some serious problems in vanilla.<p>One of the nastier problems is how chunk[1] updates are performed. It used to be <i>really</i> bad: every time a block was added/modified/removed, the entire chunk (!) used to be sent to all the clients. It&#x27;s somewhat better now, but modifications to the world still cause a lot of data to be sent[2] to the clients.<p>Even worse are the lighting recalculations. These happen on the server, which recalculates the lighting in up to a 16-block radius every time a torch is placed. These updates also happen when blocks are changed... <i>and when redstone dust or redstone repeaters change their value</i>, as they give off light. Of course, as these changes can span multiple chunks, changing redstone or placing a torch can trigger <i>multiple</i> chunks updates that need to be sent to each client.<p>This data-update problem is made <i>much, much worse</i> because of a particular design decision in Minecraft: each block stores a flag indicating if it is the top block in it&#x27;s column (that is, it receives sunlight during the day). This means any change in the top block <i>or any empty space above it</i> causes the entire vertical space from sky to the top block to be searched. This is the cause of some of the nastier &quot;lag spikes&quot;.<p>While it&#x27;s a few years old now and addresses older Minecraft versions (1.5/1.6), I highly recommend watching TrazLander&#x27;s investigation and analysis[3] of how these lighting calculations can <i>destroy</i> framerate. It is very enlightening about this weakness in Minecraft.<p>[1] The sparse octree that Minecraft uses to store the world is stored in 16x16 block horizontal, 266 block high sections called &quot;chunks&quot; <a href=""http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Chunk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Chunk</a><p>[2] Well, usually.

The base price is somewhere around $1,000 for the whole 8 weeks<i>.  The student gets 50% of this amount as a living allowance (we are not in the US) and the rest goes to the school for operating expenses.<p>If the student drops before the 8 weeks the client gets a pro-rated refund back. The student must work on the project at least 35 hours a week.<p>The client would also need to set a  monetary prize for a completed project.  The student would get the majority of the prize money and the rest would go to the school and mentors.  The prize is only due for a completed project.<p></i>The student before starting the 8 week project would have basic working knowledge of a web framework, basic html, css, git and javascript.<p>None of these ideas or numbers are set in stone.

But it is often simplistically stated, and done so without some important caveats.<p>First, to truly be informed — to be able to make sense of the news in order know what action to take on it — requires more than the news itself. The news rarely gives context to what it reports, offering instead a ceaseless torrent of facts and data points. Background knowledge on history, psychology, philosophy, and so on, gleaned from books and other more stable, in-depth information sources, is required to make connections between these facts, stake out well-founded positions, and make sound decisions.</i><p>I guess not every person is able to make informed decisions based on the news, and not everyone shares the same perspectives. But to give an example: when in pre-WW2 Germany:<p>- Hitler&#x27;s rise to power.<p>- Kristallnacht happened.<p>- I think Hitler&#x27;s anti-jew rhetoric was overt, not hidden. Most likely some news sources reviewed Hitlers pamphlet &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;.<p>For plenty of jewish people this should have been a cue that Germany and perhaps most of Europe was not safe anymore. But for whatever reasons a lot of people still chose to stay. Perhaps they were not informed (didn&#x27;t follow news), perhaps they found it hard to leave their property or relatives behind. By keeping track of the news, I think one can anticipate situations like this and take proper measures for themselves or their loved ones.<p>Now I believe Europe will face a civil war in the near future, based on the news I&#x27;ve been following in the last few years. I&#x27;m not gonna stay in Europe myself. Actually within the coming months I&#x27;ll travel to Asia and try to live there.

That is knowingly causing harm, and then tricking people into thinking they&#x27;re tolerating - all it provokes is the very same intolerance in other people, and the very same impulse to disguise this intolerance in others. The intolerant have a passive effect of reducing society&#x27;s tolerance, which have the consequence of suffering in individuals. The intolerant of the intolerant have the same passive effect, except they&#x27;re now knowingly partaking in this activity.<p>The intolerance of the intolerant makes the following situation possible: &quot;Don&#x27;t talk to that man, he is a <i>misogynist</i>! Oh by the way I <i>hate</i> misogynists. :)&quot;.

I&#x27;m finding it really hard to understand what is going on because of the lack of types. I don&#x27;t know what the arguments to functions are supposed to be or what they are returning, and because its a fairly sophisticated, large microservice architecture it is even harder to trace things across services.<p>My experience before this was working on a much smaller Java codebase - it was written well and really easy to understand. The fact that we didn&#x27;t really have much tooling was a huge help to me too - so when I deployed a service for example, I could see the shell commands and its basically a &quot;mvn package; scp ...; start ...&quot;. When i wanted to know where the logs go, I look at a log4j config in the project. When i want to know whats running, I ssh in and &quot;ps aux | grep x&quot; - there are maybe 10 servers tops for a project.<p>This is a much bigger company with hundreds of services, lots of machines, complex deploy procedures and in general just much more abstraction both in codebase and ops. My normal approach is to just dig deeper and peel back the abstractions until I see whats happening. I fear thats impossible here. Instead, we ask someone who built it or look at an outdated wiki, which is great but just so much more painful than actually <i>knowing</i> how everything fits together.<p>I am kind of lost as to where to even start understanding this codebase.

Applicatives are much less commonly used than monads (see IO etc), so I thought it would be more desirable to hit the bigger use case first without getting side tracked on applicatives.  3. I feel this progression kind of has history on its side since Applicative wasn&#x27;t a super class of Monad until very recently.<p>That being said, I&#x27;m very open to being convinced otherwise and pull requests carry a lot of weight with me.

While I personally prefer statically typed languages, I find Perl 6&#x27;s gradual typing to take an interesting approach. Perl 6&#x27;s type checker operates differently on functions and methods: functions, roles, and private methods are checked at compile time, but public methods are checked at run time. As Jonathan Worthington wrote in a presentation on Perl 6&#x27;s approach, lexical scoping is &quot;your language&quot; but a public method call is &quot;the object&#x27;s language&quot;: &quot;it&#x27;s for the receiving object to decide how to dispatch the method,&quot; which might be familiar to people who have used Smalltalk. This approach also allows easy interoperability with libraries from dynamic languages, such as using Perl 5 or Python code in Perl 6.<p>I&#x27;m very interested to see how this approach works out in practice.

WindowMaker&#x27;s remained my go-to largely for this reason, along with a handful of others.<p>Second: less-than-full-height windows can be quite useful. Being able to specify a &quot;stack&quot; into  which, say, I place a video (or video-chat) app, various A/V controls, and possibly some monitors or other smaller windows, perhaps a shorter terminal window or three, is easily something I&#x27;d like to do.<p>With WindowMaker I can _arrange_ windows in a pseudo-tiled state. Unfortunately it&#x27;s too easy to accidentally drag one off somewhere. Generally, though, this can be quite handy.<p>What I&#x27;d really like to be able to do is to specify roles for certain window locations.

Because you know the answers are going to bullshit opinions and holy wars, mostly by people that are trying to solve different problems than you, or are actually less knowledgeable than you.<p>Given the fact that Reddit and similar forums suck for finding solutions to specific problems, why should a Q/A site that is good for finding solutions for specific problems try to emulate it?<p>Quora and Yahoo answers also suck because the questions are almost entirely anecdote and opinion based, and it seems to be acceptable to cite &quot;experience&quot; as a source for bullshit opinions. &quot;Being a pilot with 10 years of experience&quot; is not an adequate reference for a response to a question about the safety of using a cellphone radio on a commercial flight, nor does &quot;being a veteran&quot; count as original research into Iraqi popular support for the 2003 invasion.<p>Of the good &quot;answers&quot; from Quora that I&#x27;ve seen shared, all are basically long form blog posts that have found a &quot;close enough&quot; question to answer, rather than been motivated by the question, and I would have actually preferred to read them on medium or some other blog site. However interesting they are, they aren&#x27;t answers.<p>I think projects like Rosetta code are useful for comparisons of programming languages, because they keep it concrete. \nYou can also look at big high-quality projects on github or whatever and directly judge the subjective qualities of a language for yourself, based on how readable the code looks to you.",1453262462

89765,comment,89626,89704,0,0,jackdied,,,"Definitely, you don't want to scan the filesystem to do searches.  But finding user 1234's profile in profiles/1234.data is easy.  In my experience this works well (even with the wasted space) though operations like fsck start to get painful when you have 1 million+ files.<p>An anecdote on bad linear search:  in the 90s I worked on a system in C++ that made heavy use of inheritance and other C-plus-plus-ery.  There was a bunch of file opener classes each that found files in a different way (regexp, straight path, glob).  They differed only in a method named match.  The base class called match on every file name in the directory until it returned true.  That was fine for regexps but even if you opened a file _by name_ it took N/2 syscalls to readdir to find it!  This worked OK until someone created a directory with 10k entries on a production box.  Ouch.",1197682016
89764,comment,89545,89722,0,0,robg,,,"Sorry, it's still rare for me that folks outside my research area want to hear more. Two people makes a quorum!<p>The abbreviated background: Young children tend to confuse movement and naturalness with life. So if you ask a typical four-year-old if a cloud is alive, they'll tend to say yes. Same deal for things like a mountain and a truck. They don't know yet that life involves mechanistic things ""inside"" the organism. Similarly, they'll deny life to plants becuase they don't do anything. There's been a ton of research in this area because it addresses why young children are initially confused and how they can best be brought along toward mature knowledge. Even still, it takes us years to understand basic life processes. You might learn what's alive or not alive, but obviously the knowledge drills much deeper than that.<p>Results: Any case, the very first study I conducted as a grad student, I found that undergraduates, when tested under speeded conditions, have much more difficulty answering, for example, that a cloud, a mountain, and a truck are not living things than saying the same for a table. Same difficulty for calling plants living things as compared to animals. Just to show how hard it is to see the forest for the trees (pun intended), it took me five years to even think about testing bio profs. And wouldn't you know, they replicated the effects but with one important caveat. They showed improved performance for living things, as compared to the undergrads, but still much worse for plants than for animals and no improvement for the moving and natural non-living things. Even after 20 years of advanced biology training, they are still ""thinking"" like little kids, on some level. <p>Of course, I'm interested to hear complaints, concerns, or questions. But my take-away is that if something as simple as living or non-living can't be overwritten once much more advanced knowledge is acquired, and for many years at that, then learning that involves change is really, really hard. Better to rely on common schemes as much as possible, and expect users to learn as little as possible.<p>I wish I could cite a paper, but this startup stuff has had me happily distracted from the joys of publishing. But the manuscript is in decent shape and once my co-author looks at it, we'll send it out for review.",1197681844

It's easy to get close to 100% utilization.<p>However, it fails miserably in the creative process of software development.  But unfortunately many managers at all levels adhere to it and use it in planning and project management.  It's one of the reasons software project is often over budget and late in delivery.

(1) tons of bulk-registered names are NOT hosted on GD's nameservers
(2) People complained that transfers were slow and cancelled some of them. (in the background, GD refused to do transfers or delayed it for days, gambling that people would get frustrated and blame the new registar).
(3) bulk-registered names (think of hundreds of marketers with 1000+ domains each) are usually split over numerous fake names to minimize their footprint and prevent wholesale site copying. GD allows fake name purchases. After the transfers started, GD began a policy of requiring a scanned drivers' licence for transfers. They also seize domains for themselves and resell them.

To learn, I used an open source typing tutor, klavaro, and found it worked quite well.<p>The first week or so was painful. After a few days I had learned the position of all the keys, but typing had become a strenuous mental activity. Simple tasks such as writing an email became very difficult because I was so focused on how to type it that I could not focus on what it was I wanted to type. The other difficult part was passwords. It usually took a few tries before getting them correct, and sometimes I even had to resort to copying and pasting to make sure passwords were correct.<p>As others have noted, typing speed may not be as critical for programmers as it is for others. While this may be true for coding, I found the initial slowdown when IMing/emailing coworkers to be frustrating.<p>After around a month, these difficulties went away, and typing started to feel much more natural. I'm still not at the speed I was before, but typing feels so much betters now. Overall, I am happy I switched to Dvorak, and would definitely recommend it. I notice my speed improving everyday, and I actually enjoy and look forward to typing now. Using emacs with Dvorak has not been an issue for me. In fact, I would say it feels better now.<p>Another change I made that I feel has boosted my productivity is remapping caps lock to ctrl. Caps lock is in a great location on the keyboard but performs a somewhat rarely used function. I would highly recommend remapping caps lock to something more useful.",1325699205

Virality - Highly viral product that got shared enough to the point that almost everyone knows about it (in current target demographic).  Throw up that Mission Accomplished banner.<p>2.  Engagement: Falls off here. Most early adopters got bored, and it's just now catching on with what I would call the ""early majority.""  This would be fine except they're running through the same cycle of being bored by checkins.  Reviews/Radar seems like an attempt to engage their users beyond check-ins, which probably seems more confusing than anything else for the typical early majority user.  I think the problem here is that they've lost the ""core user group"" (aka that bored early adopter) you're talking about...the type of people that would spend time curating lists, putting up great content, and getting a kick out of people checking in to their recommendations.<p>3. Monetization:  Nobody seems to care about this anymore, but with their level of funding/valuation, it's probably becoming increasingly difficult to tell them that they're just a few pivots away from making money.  However, until they have a clear idea of how people will engage with their product, I'm not so sure they'll know how to monetize.

If someone roots the master box that you're pushing from or that your clients are pulling from, you're boned.<p>Technically you don't <i>have</i> to use root anywhere. You can push from a master box as an unpriviledged user and specify any user on the target machine to connect as, and ssh keys (along with an agent) will take care of the rest. The target machine doesn't need to be running your config management as root, you just need to set up a config management account with rights to the users/groups that your services are running. Your service may get compromised but root wouldn't - until they run a local priv escalation 0day.<p>I think you're confused. Since the tools are using either SSL or SSH these protocols (when properly implemented) prevent mitm or spoofing attacks on things like dns or routing protocols. Your key does not get intercepted, ever, because you're never sending a private key. But some machine, somewhere, has to have keys or you can't log in.<p>The only thing you have to worry about is someone getting both the keys AND access to a server that's running an agent that you've authed with. If you're super duper paranoid ssh-agent has an option to never cache a given key's authorization so it can ask you for the password for the key every time you use it. I'm pretty sure that would be super annoying, though, so better to just run one agent once for an entire batch push/deployment and kill it once your job is done.",1325698415

They are not simply there in reality. <i>Why</i> do we have them?<p>It is not about justifying piracy, it is saying we should not even have the laws in the first place that lead to the possibility of piracy.<p>You might reply that this is ridiculous: simply changing the name of an act does not remove the harm it does. But this is the core of the matter: with copying, that reply is basically false! (Piracy is in legal terms a <i>malum prohibitum</i> not a <i>malum in se</i>.)<p>Look at the underlying phenomena, prior to any legal construction. Copying is an abstract relation: there is no physical connection between an original and a copy. It no more harms someone to be copied than it harms the number 4 when you write it down. Since copying renders no harm, and in fact the opposite, it is very beneficial, and furthermore it is an abundance, why should we restrict it? (No moral argument for copyright/IP/etc. seems ever to have answered that.)<p>In practice it may possibly be that selling creative effort is difficult to do optimally without some structure like copyright etc. That is the contention of the standard economic view. But that gives only a very particular and limited justification. Such restrictions on copying are justified only insofar as they actually turn out to help us overall.<p>Which returns us the gist of the article: if those restrictions do not help much, or rather have comparable alternatives, the justification for their existence is gone.",1325698106

The studios are huge companies embedded in other, even bigger companies, so there's a large amount of inertia. The MPAA is just the symptom of this. Go through the list Blank mentions: none, I repeat , none of those advances came from the industry itself, it was always some outside influence that the movie business resisted and then had to eventually deal with.<p>But the inertia of the studios is only part of the story. Large actor's unions, e.g. SAG, also oppose drastic changes, because they understand the current model and don't want it to be disrupted too much. This is similar to how teacher's unions are generally against efforts like the Khan Academy. Remember that many actors (e.g. Charlie Chaplin) in the 20s were against the introduction to sound to movies due to precisely the same kind of intellectual and business inertia.<p>One of my favorite quotes: ""Institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution.""",1325697637

I never really did much coding, and this year, I've been getting the feeling that it's not really for me.<p>I love the idea of coding, but it seems like I just don't have the attitude that many hackers talk about in respect to coding: I don't particularly like problem solving, I don't really get that ""rush"" when I solve something, etc.<p>So, basically, I need ideas. I'm thinking about dropping out of my Computer Science program and switching to Economics or something non-technical, but I'd eventually love to get a semi-technical job, where I'm dealing with technology but without my primary function being as a coder.<p>What's out there? Does anyone have a clearer idea then me of what I'm looking for?<p>Thanks,<p>kipsfi.<p>EDIT: In a perfect world, I guess I'd love a job where my primary function is something else, but if we needed some extra hands on code, I'd be able to get in there and get that done too.",1325696472

That's why I switched to DuckDuckGo a long time ago, but people like me are a tiny minority.<p>Now speaking as a web publishing, if people started to copy-and-paste my articles into Google+ and these entries got higher rankings on Google search than my original content, I'd be pretty upset too.  It isn't a question of what search engine I use in this instance, but what the majority of everyone else is using.",1325696461

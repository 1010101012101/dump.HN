Knew at least a scripting language and basic C programming. The trend however has been for less and less coding skills and more superficial. Sometimes not even any shell scripting skills.<p>In the Windows world, a lot of the Sys Admins do not have those skills. It&#x27;s changing, things like PowerShell and various others are helping, but a lot of Windows Admin are just not that comfortable away from the GUI.

9173042,comment,9156405,9156811,0,0,copsarebastards,,,"Basically the idea is to do long-term storage in short-term memory (RAM) by distributing the storage across many machines. One one machine you shouldn&#x27;t store stuff you want stored long-term in short-term memory (RAM) because as soon as the short-term memory loses power the data is gone. RAM temporal storage attempts to mitigate this problem by duplicating the data across many many machines so that if one machine powers off, the other machines still have the data.<p>This is sort of a holy grail of distributed computing because it could allow people to elastically donate their storage similarly to how people donate their CPU cycles to Folding@Home or GPU cycles to BTC mining. The idea is that a lot of your CPU cycles (for example) are wasted because you aren&#x27;t doing anything on your computer, so you can donate those cycles to Folding@Home. You could do something similar with RAM, but RAM is different: if I decide to run a program and start using my CPU cycles again Folding@Home can just push computation to another machine. But if I decide to reclaim RAM from a distributed computing system to run a program on my machine, then whatever the system was storing in RAM is lost, and if they need that, they a) need to have it duplicated elsewhere, and b) need to know how to retrieve it efficiently from a network of computers any of which may or may not actually have the data. This has proven to be a very hard problem to solve in practice.",1425927306

This means more intelligent support programs and treating it like designing and delivering a software project (or, more accurately a series of subprojects) as opposed to a loose amalgam of scripts.<p>This also requires the product development team to be keenly aware of that support architecture and how their decisions factor into it especially in terms of testing, deployment, and module interactivity.<p>> Ops teams have been doing automation of support systems for a while, so what exactly does it mean to be DevOps?<p>DevOps has been around for a while -- way before there was a word for it.  I think DevOps has come into its own, recently, though because platforms have become hugely more flexible while at the same time a consensus built on what it means to manage those systems.  The difference, I think, is whether things are built to remain somewhat static or if change is designed for.  Are development ideas like encapsulation and decoupling etc designed into the system?  Smart sysadmins have been doing this stuff for a long time but now organizations are taking the approach into account all the way up and down the chain.  And, yes, that means that product developers need to be fully aware of operational needs but, in my opinion, I don&#x27;t think that means they build the operational tools themselves.<p>>your fancy &#x27;DevOps&#x27; team just ends up being separated and isolated from the dev team you&#x27;re back at square one<p>Demarcation of responsibility doesn&#x27;t mean demarcation of information.  The product development team will need to be intimately aware of what is happening in operations and vice versa.  In a DevOps implementing environment it is unavoidable.<p>> the dev side need to understand and willing to learn about ops, it&#x27;s not rocket science<p>These days it&#x27;s getting pretty close.  I don&#x27;t think it is fair to product developers to say &quot;Listen, we like the idea of what Docker can do for us so you are going to learn it inside and out.&quot;  Somewhere you have to say &quot;Hey, we probably want to implement Docker.  Ops, dig in.  You know how our product is currently structured and how operations currently works with that.  Try to figure out what needs to change and what doesn&#x27;t.  X and Y from the dev team will be made available for deeper discussions and testing as needed.  When the overall gist of what has to change is known, we&#x27;ll all get together, ops and produce dev, to get everyone on the same page.&quot;   It&#x27;s a bleeding of information, not a full on &#x27;shake it all up&#x27; scenario.<p>Neither side can be a black box anymore if the current state of software development and delivery is going to be taken advantage of.  But neither can everyone know and do everything or context switch as needed.<p>Keep in mind:  I am not a DevOps theorist -- maybe I have it completely wrong according to the people that came up with it but this is my practical understanding of the movement.",1425927267

With it, you can also learn a lot by making an AI play starting at a certain move, or making AI&#x27;s play against each other.<p>You can also buy Goban from the app store to play GnuGo or Pachi (both bundled), but it is a bit buggy (and not really better than the older free version).  They do respond to bug reports though so it sounds like they are actively working on it.<p>Start out playing 9x9 against GnuGo.  Give yourself a 9-stone handicap, you should probably win.  Take away handicap stones until you can win with a 3 stone handicap.<p>In general you don&#x27;t want to play an AI at less than 3-stone handicap or you will learn bad habits.<p>At that point, play against GnuGo 19x19 with a 9-stone handicap.  If you are a beginner around 20kyu, you will find it a challenge to win.<p>I&#x27;ve been practicing consistently for the past couple of months.  I do problems on goproblems.com or from a few iPhone apps.  I&#x27;ve played a couple of games against ranked bots on kgs and am ranked 15kyu there since I beat a popular 16kyu-ranked bot.  KGS is inflated through so I&#x27;m probably around 20kyu, still a complete beginner.  I beat GnuGo 19x19 at a 9-stone handicap but not quite yet at an 8-stone handicap.<p>Once you are able to beat GnuGo 19x19 at a lower handicap then you can start playing against Fuego or Pachi.  But at that point you should also already be playing humans regularly - it&#x27;s a very different playing style in that you&#x27;ll come across clearly bad moves that you will have to learn to recognize and take advantage of.",1425927177

Usually, it is then interpreted to mean &quot;couldn&#x27;t be predicted&quot;.<p>Huh? No. &quot;Exceptional problems&quot; are ones where the only thing that the code does is report the error. Whether a problem is exceptional is dependent on whether or not it&#x27;s part of the normal workflow.<p>This is why there are, for example, 2 integer parsing methods in many languages, one that returns false for strings that aren&#x27;t integers and one that throws an exception. It&#x27;s up to the user of the function whether they have a way to handle the exception or whether they just want to report it to the user and exit.<p>> My rule of thumb is to use an exception whenever the function cannot complete its contract.<p>Exceptions that a function might throw are part of its contract.<p>>  If I have a function LogIn(username, password), I expect to be logged in after the function completes.<p>That&#x27;s a <i>terrible</i> design. You&#x27;ve violated a ton of different principles: single responsibility principle being the biggest.<p>For this I would have something like `authorize(username, password)` that figures out whether the username/password is valid, and then `login()` that actually creates the session. I might have another function `tryLogin(username, password)` that tries to login and returns some error info on failure.<p>In your system, what happens when a login happens and slips past your exception handler because it&#x27;s used in a place that you didn&#x27;t expect it to be used, and there&#x27;s no type checking on exceptions? You just let the whole system go down. What happens when you want to log in with an auth token instead of a username/password? Have fun separating out your session logic. What happens when you want to write stress tests against your login system and now have to piece together a test suite that covers all cases for a monolith because you don&#x27;t have any units to unit test? You rewrite the whole thing is what happens.<p>> Anything that trickles back up to the user and is displayed as an error message will have lag based on the user&#x27;s reading speed.<p>Or it will cause lag for your entire server because wrong logins are fucking your stack and therefore your garbage collection.",1425926934

If a person says, &quot;He did X to me under Y conditions&quot; and the observer comes back with &quot;but Y conditions would seem to make X rather difficult&quot; and the original person says &quot;well, I have different definition of X&quot;, the observer instantly feels like the credibility of the person has decreased.<p>If a person gives a pretty unambiguous description of events, their credibility tends to be high. If a person&#x27;s story is going to be widely believe, believed in a court of law and so-forth, we want their credibility to be high.<p>I think I can understand emotional appeal of the argument that the victim shouldn&#x27;t be under scrutiny and shouldn&#x27;t have to prove her case.

Where is Twitter?<p>I get a fair amount of bogus traffic, robots scraping for site vulnerabilities, black hat SEO&#x27;s trying to find every blog that allows anonymous comments, etc. And I&#x27;m reasonably aggressive about shutting those folks out. If you&#x27;re abusing the TOS I try to shut you down, if you complain we&#x27;ll talk about it, if you don&#x27;t well you stay shut down.<p>So for anyone in Twitter, these are pretty clearly bogus accounts. Bogus enough to support mass banning and waiting for the &#x27;real&#x27; ones (if they exist) to complain. So why not just ban/suspend them? Does anyone even try to weed out robots?<p>Obviously there is a market alignment issue, Twitter likes to quote &#x27;number of accounts&#x27; or &#x27;number of signups&#x27; or &#x27;monthly active users&#x27; as a metric for &quot;goodness&quot;. And suspending all the robots would make all of those numbers go down. But it would make their actual user experience better right? Or would it strip away the &#x27;purchased hordes&#x27;[1] and suddenly make their users depressed that they had lost a big chunk of their followers that day?<p>One could be very pragmatic about such things, and consider Twitter to essentially be a game, where the score is &quot;followers&quot; and the rules are flexible (basically anyone Twitter doesn&#x27;t suspend/ban is a legit point in your score), and as a game it has recruited some interesting high level players (like major brands). When you look at it that way, it makes them look like geniuses, &quot;Hey look, we got General Motors playing Twitter and their in-game purchases are going through the roof!&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/31/caught-blue-handed-someone-is-buying-mitt-romney-twitter-popularity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/31/caught-blue-handed-someone-...</a>",1425925538

We lost a number of people to two different product acquisitions and then gained a few etc.  Always a bit of an ebb and flow, but it has generally worked well for me since 1999. BTW I am also in Florida.<p>It sounds to me as if you are missing the key ingredient to the mix, you need marketing and business management/development of some sort.  My bet is the team as a whole has a good sized network to pull from, you just may lack the experience and knowledge of using it to get deal flow.<p>Not that you asked, but for 10-15 guys, you need significant project flow to keep everyone employed and happy at fair wages. It will equate to a bare minimum of $140k or so per month in revenue, personally, I&#x27;d be more comfortable near $200-210k as a minimum target for the whole team. If you assume you take minimum agreements of $30k or so, you need roughly 5-7 new deals a month to keep cash flow moving or work towards getting larger deals but those generally take time. Additionally you have to see how the mix of your team fits projects to see how that would work, e.g. you may have to support a devops (just an example) person for a few months when there is little devops work coming through.<p>If you want to chat I am in Central Florida too, happy to met up or chat via email etc. We may have some complementary skills that would benefit both our teams.",1425924914

What they are putting on the table is a good intro to the specific niche: basically they have the client whom would buy our product<p>- we&#x27;ve analysed the market and the requirements and presented them with the final ideas of the project to develop, some where based on our technology, some where other business opportunities that the investor hadn&#x27;t thought of and that we could build.<p>- now, once the presentation is done, they are asking to sign a &quot;mutual&quot; NDA (which &quot;seems&quot; mild enough), in order to keep talking about the rest of the project.<p># My concerns:\n1- there&#x27;s many things about the investor that make it an undesirable partner (some parts are good, but most are bad)<p>2- Because the market opportunity is real, very very big, and largely untapped, we maybe still want to pursue it, and we still would like to honour the &quot;introduction&quot; to the opportunity done by the potential investor<p>3- We are afraid that this NDA could be wrongly leveraged in the future, if we end up pursuing and reaching this market.<p>Here&#x27;s a pastebin of the generic mutual NDA\nhttp://pastebin.com/e2ZUU5qj<p>Any suggestions? I&#x27;m only afraid that this could be a liability for future developments of our product if it somehow overlaps the market opportunity they introduced us to.\nthanks",1425924445

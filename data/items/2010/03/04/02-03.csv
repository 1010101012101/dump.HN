1165990,comment,1165623,1165623,0,0,sgacka,,,"Libraries were created so that you could focus on mastering new and unexplored territory, not to replace programmers.<p>As a beginner, I didn't appreciate big libraries (like Cocoa).  I couldn't wrap my head around the idea of having tons of prewritten code and stitching it together - I understood programming as writing code - so I wanted to write my own damn code, not just manipulate massive libraries.<p>So I turned to PHP and developed my own webapp (a stripped down Google Docs), from scratch.  I quickly stumbled upon the purpose of frameworks and libraries.  After writing my 20th SQL query I realized I was wasting time. About 10 hours later, I made my own light PHP framework. Now I didn't have to worry about my SQL syntax (it was automated based on the data model variables) and I got to start working on really cool/interesting programming issues rather than the mundane blah code.<p>Now I've started to investigate Cocoa again and I realize that libraries and frameworks have not hurt programming, but dramatically catapulted it into the realm of science rather than plug-and-chug.  Today, our software is more complex than ever and it will only get more complex in the future.<p>I think if you see programming as just ""stitching libraries together"",  then you've lost your passion or never had any to begin with. Programming has evolved into a science where you have to learn the foundations (languages) AND the pre-existing solutions (libraries) in order to figure out what's been done for you so that you can focus on exploring new and more complex issues.",1267671486

In the 80s, at the beginning of my 'professional' programming career, I wanted to not believe those who foresaw our careers as being like engine and automotive engineers of the early 20th century.  That is, destined to become ""parts changers"".<p>Early-phase technology workers with those sophisticated machines were true 'engineers', and were paid well.  Over time, things evolved (of course).  That history confirmed and taught that as technology matures, it becomes commodity.  Economies of scale emerge, markets develop, etc. make it such that the technology practitioners ultimately become installers and configure-ers.  I think it started to go awry, in my timeline, when the term Application Programming Interface (API) hit the streets.  :-)<p>However, the above is really only true in the 'application development' space.  Most software development opportunities are in that space; and therefore, yes, most opportunities to develop software are boring, non-engineering jobs -- rather blue-collar, in fact.  To one steeped in a true CS background, that's a real disappointment when considering a lifetime career.  This is true for those in their 20s as well as their 40s.<p>So, I agree with other posters here: get creative!  Reject the direction of the herd, if it seems fitting.  Do it anyway, just to experience and learn.",1267671240

The fact that the seller uses the phrase ""they tell me"" when talking about bubbling paint being a sign of water leakage is somewhat worrisome -- if he's not sure about that kind of thing, then what does that say about the rest of the work done on it? And, blaming the vehicle's inability to brake easily on the engine's power and the size of the tires is just wrong. Braking distance is a function of the braking system, the vehicle's speed, the vehicle's mass, the vehicle's front suspension, and the vehicle's tires (where bigger tires are <i>better</i>).<p>Daniel and I disagree pretty strongly on environmental matters, and I'm trying very hard not to let that affect my reaction to this.

In fact intellectual property is a government grant of a costly and dangerous private monopoly over ideas. We show through theory and example that intellectual monopoly is not necessary for innovation and as a practical matter is damaging to growth, prosperity and liberty.</i> -- David K. Levine and Michelle Boldrin in <i>Against Intellectual Monopoly</i><p>This book has absolutely change my thought about how economic progress are made, who is the real good guys and bad guys of civilization, and everything else. I never quite look at innovation and entrepreneurs quite the same way ever again.<p>Please, everyone, read it. It's free to download!",1267668151

Through the use of fake email addresses, domains, and IPs, Wiseguys claimed to be over 1,000 different people. Whether this is against Ticketmaster's TOS may be immaterial, since the ""fraud"" charge applies just to the act of claiming to be someone else, not the use or material repercussions of the claim (as opposed to a civil suit). There are also a number of cases where Wiseguys' bots gained access to tickets nominally only available to exclusive groups, of which neither the bots (obviously) or Wiseguys were a member.<p>Additionally, many of the ticket purchases were agreed upon ahead of time with specific brokers, which probably makes the false-identity charges much stronger. There's also one shell company run by Wiseguys that claimed to be selling tickets directly from the venue, which it was not.<p>b. The tickets say they are not allowed to be resold. I do not know the legal status of such claims, but you agree to those terms before the purchase, which removes one of the weak points of TOS enforcement.<p>On the personal side of things, while TicketMaster isn't my favorite company either, someone grabbing all their tickets to inflate the prices even higher by adding two additional middlemen doesn't really help things. I consider Wiseguys to be the scummier actor here.",1267668139

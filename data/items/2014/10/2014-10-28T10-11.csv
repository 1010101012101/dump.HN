Well heck, it&#x27;s never going away until you replace people with robots. I was attacked by a clown as a kid, I hate and fear clowns.

Cause and effect, plain and simple. The same currently nobody seems to understand that we have even lower interest rates today. From 2008 till 2014. And all this money goes to (primarily) US Treasuries. US Treasuries are currently the most expensive in its 300 year history. Mortgage APR fixed for 30 years at 4%. For 15 years at 3.5%. When the real inflation rate felt by consumers is at about 10%. Why nobody sees that? People don&#x27;t like to think. They prefer imaginary fantasies where everything is just fine to brutal reality of the unproductive economy running from a bubble to bubble sponsored only by the USD being reserve currency of the world.<p>Once the US Treasuries bubble bursts, the same moment, the bubble in the US Dollar and America will burst too.<p>We&#x27;re living in the final stages of the final bubble, mother of all bubbles in the mankind history. So we have house prices in bubble territory, car loans in bubble territory, Wall Street in bubble territory, VCs/startup scene in bubble territory. Enjoy the ride!

8520225,comment,8511007,8518744,0,0,deong,,,"As far as I know, every system that can go to LaTeX as an export option gives you a basic LaTeX document. I don&#x27;t know how you tell Pandoc, for instance, &quot;OK, I need three authors in the author block, centered horizontally, with their affiliations below their names. But authors 1 and 2 have the same affiliation, so only include that information once, but center it below both names as a unit.&quot;<p>How do I tell CSS that I want my bibliography to be sorted by author last name, and have the inline citations be of the form (Author, Year), except when I&#x27;m using the author&#x27;s name in the text as a noun, in which case it should be just &quot;Author (Year) showed that blah blah blah&quot;? For that matter, I don&#x27;t think CSS can even do justification properly (by properly, I mean not treating each line as an independent unit, but shifting text around within an entire paragraph to minimize deviation from the desired inter-word spacing globally). I know someone implemented TeX&#x27;s algorithm in Javascript once upon a time, but I&#x27;m willing to bet it&#x27;s not any faster than TeX.<p>I have no real argument against the idea that you could build something that does everything LaTeX does just as well. Clearly you can. I am arguing that LaTeX has a huge amount of really important things already built in, and people use those things every single day. You have to (a) have all that stuff ready on day one if you want people to use a new thing, and (b) getting from where you are today to that point will necessarily involve taking the nice clean thing that seems so much nicer than LaTeX and making it messier, uglier, and more complex. The only thing that makes Markdown, for instance, nice for people to use is that it only does a handful of common things, so it can make those common things simple and conventional. <i></i>Bold<i></i> to bold something. (Amusing and apropos to the topic, HN&#x27;s version of Markdown appears to not allow me to type star-starBoldstar-star. Not with backslashes or any other way I can find). If you want to build a LaTeX clone though, you need to decide: what&#x27;s going to be the simple, easy-for-people convention we use to denote &quot;don&#x27;t put a line break here, because these two characters are someone&#x27;s initials&quot; and &quot;stack these equations in a group, centered on the equal signs, and include the individual equations on lines 1, 3, 5, and 8 in the global numbering of equations, but not the others.&quot; You&#x27;re going to have to define a stylesheet of some sort to govern the rendering engine&#x27;s myriad options (do I indent the first line of a paragraph, or should everything be left-aligned, but with extra vertical space between paragraphs).<p>CSS is arguably already uglier, messier, and more complex, and while I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s improving all the time, as of about five years ago, I think the entire internet was almost exclusively composed of porn and articles about how to center something vertically, in roughly equal proportion. Epub is an HTML+CSS based format specifically geared at the kind of thing that you&#x27;d need, and just like every other technology we&#x27;re mentioning, it&#x27;s terrible unless you&#x27;re doing left-to-right, top-to-bottom, figure-less, table-less, text where formatting doesn&#x27;t matter. Just like CSS3, we can say, Epub3 supports more stuff now! Someone let me know when it&#x27;s safe to buy ebooks with code samples in them instead of getting the paper version.",1414491504

I have had roles in small start-ups as CTO, but did the role of a Lead Developer in reality, it was important to get investment that they had a CTO on board that had a track record and could talk to investors, but I still had to build everything as well. Thinking back it would have been better to get a 2 day a week CTO and a full time Lead dev.<p>Mid Size:10>40
In a company this size with a dev team of 10ish its more of a Development Manager Role, this is some times worst than a startup as you have to be hands on, speak to investors and run a team.<p>Larger:>50
This is where a real CTO can really make a different, by this size you would have a couple of functional managers as your direct reports to look after day to day and get the time to focus on culture, team, investors, new tech, presentations etc.",1414490773

Writing tools seem vastly inferior to developer tools when it comes to basic layout and document conversion. At the moment Storytella is aimed at novels for self-publishing authors so doesn&#x27;t have much in the way of complex formatting - I want to update the Markdown syntax it uses to include some of the extensions available such as table formatting.<p>[0] <a href=""https://storytel.la/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://storytel.la/</a>",1414490757

However, loads of software used by millions and netting millions can be and is written by people who most would describe as barely mathematically literate, from most sorts of business/accounting software (unless arithmetic is math) to device drivers to dating sites (where you could and will use heavyweight machine learning to match people but it kinda seems that having actual people on the site delivers 99.99% of the value regardless of said machine learning.)<p>There are counter-examples in every area, of course, it&#x27;s just that the majority of programmers out there aren&#x27;t great at math and are very much employable. And more often than not, people who&#x27;re <i>really</i> great at math go to great lengths to avoid programming even when their work revolves around computers.<p>CS <i>is</i> a branch of math, of course, but this fact happily co-exists with all of the above.",1414490638

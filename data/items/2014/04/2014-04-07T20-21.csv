They have limited partners (LPs) that provide the money, and expect returns on it. This LP money goes into funds (vehicles to make investments out of). Each fund has a limited lifespan (the company I work for has fund lifetimes of around 8-10 years). This means that all of the money should be returned to investors over that time period. Since VCs can&#x27;t make all of their investments at the beginning of the fund (for many reasons, chief among them scarcity) they need to show returns in an even shorter timeframe.<p>The bootstrapped founder, on the other hand, doesn&#x27;t necessarily need to exit the investment in those 8-10 (or shorter) years. There are, of course, serial entrepreneurs for whom that is their goal, and for them (as the article points out) their incentives are aligned.

7549401,comment,7547488,7548552,4,0,anigbrowl,,,"Actually, they wouldn&#x27;t - but I&#x27;m going to preface my comment with Krugman&#x27;s observation that &#x27;So now you know why economists are useless: when they actually do understand something, people don&#x27;t want to hear about it.&#x27; Also, the argument below doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m endorsing the status quo in SF city politics.<p>The problems are twofold: geography, and the fact that SF doesn&#x27;t operate in a vacuum. Geographically, there&#x27;s water on 3 sides and hills on the 4th. No matter what you do SF is always going to engaged in an uphill fight against density because it&#x27;s almost as much of an island as Manhattan is. The vacuum is the bigger problem. Even if the mayor and board of supervisors agreed to abolish the planning commission tomorrow and hand out permits to any proposal compliant with building safety codes, it would not do much to accelerate building.<p>Why? Because neighbors would sue under CEQA, the California Environmental Quality Act. This allows virtually anyone to file a suit alleging that a negative impact on the environment or an insufficiency in the preparation of an environmental impact report, anywhere in CA. This is not just &#x27;the environment&#x27; in terms of wild salmon or old-growth forest, though - it includes everything from air quality to aesthetics. I&#x27;m expecting to be invited to join a suit on this because I live close to a hospital which is planning a large expansion, and the neighbors a few blocks away are furious about the likely change in traffic patterns and noise during the construction phase, which will last a few years. I don&#x27;t actually care about this, but on the other hand I have misgivings about the proposed siting of a helipad right across the street from me.<p>And this leads to the observation that while CEQA has become a go-to example of obstructive red tape/environmentalism gone mad in California, it&#x27;s actually just a culmination of much longer-standing legal traditions benefiting property owners. Any place that you have sufficient density for people and businesses to annoy each other, property owners end up in court with disputes about who should give way to whom. Grumble as one might about property taxes, nobody wants the value of their property to go down, either on paper in the more abstract sense of having less enjoyment due to (say) a reduction in the pleasantness of one&#x27;s view or the amount of sunlight one&#x27;s garden receives (which factors ultimately affect the $ value of their property anyway). If you have paid $$$ to buy a fancy loft with an amazing view of the SF skyline, you and your neighbors are going to be most unhappy if some developer proposes erecting a skyscraper and replacing your view with that of a concrete wall 30 feet away. In a more general context, people are much less enthusiastic about paying property taxes for parks and schools if the erection of tall buildings blocks sunlight from ever reaching them (and that particular complaint is a frequent one in SF, where the hilly geography tends to exacerbate the issue).<p>The complaints of property owners carry a great deal of weight in arguments over planning, since they provide a large part of the current tax base (vs the hypothetical future tax revenue of any given development) and angry taxpayers are highly likely to vote out officials who don&#x27;t do their bidding and vote in those who are willing to pass laws restricting the use or development of property. Indeed, annoyed property owners have historically not just objected to new development but have often successfully argued for a halt to existing land use which impacts their enjoyment of property: in a famous English legal case, <i>Sturges v. Bridgeman</i> (1879), a doctor bought a house in a nice neighborhood and then successfully sued a nearby candy-maker, who had been there for years, over the noise of the candy-making. The court reasoned that while the candy maker had indeed been there first, the business was much noiiser than anything else in the neighborhood and it was only a matter of time before <i>someone</i> brought it up, regardless of the fact that the doctor had &#x27;come to the nuisance.&#x27; That seems wacky, but think about it in the context of a city like SF that used to have a lot more light industry inside the city borders. If you know the city well at street level, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve come across places where there&#x27;s a bunch of shiny new apartments and hip restaurants, stores etc., except for that one wierd lot with a run down small manufactory/liquor store whatever, that either doesn&#x27;t fit with the neighborhood any mroe or whose customers have gone away due to changes in traffic patterns. The business situated there makes less and less money, the owners maintain it less and less well, and eventually someone launches a blight lawsuit in an attempt to force the current occupant out.<p>The practical upshot of this for development is that a developer has to take into account the loss-of-value that a project will impose upon neighboring property as a potential development cost, and a <i>wise</i> developer will secure their agreement by offering to pay that cost to the neighbors up front, because otherwise they&#x27;ll probably just end up paying the same amount in damages later (unless they gamble on winning an arms race of legal transaction costs, which is much more viable in rural than urban areas).",1396903981

I mitigated this concern by hiring part-timers who also had other jobs. An added benefit was that having multiple part-timers vs. one full-timer also gave us redundancy in the event of vacation, illness, etc.<p>BTW, my situation was primarily with customer service reps as well.<p>Hiring multiple people does require additional training and administrative overhead, etc. and your business needs may or may not allow for such a solution. But, you can also mitigate  your legitimate concern by being completely transparent with candidates with regard to the company&#x27;s position. You might even consider offering a little upside bonus for the good months/quarters or paying slightly higher than market to offset their downside risk.<p>Given the current labor market, you will possibly find that candidates who would otherwise have no prospects are happy to take on the risk of having even potentially short-lived employment.<p>In the end, you can find a solution that works for all.

Personally, I find it quite disturbing that there are hardworking people earning a poverty wage at or near minimum wage. My common sense idea about what a minimum fair wage is about twice what it is. Doubling minimum wage in Europe (like tripling or quadrupling it in The States) will not help the people earning that wage, on average.

In particular, I think the common difference between okay discrimination and not-okay discrimination is judging people for <i>what they are</i> vs <i>what they do</i>.<p>The first is unfair and cruel, the second is a necessity of daily life and may or may not be cruel depending on circumstances.<p>Judging someone because of their race, sex, orientation, religious beliefs? Things they have absolutely no direct control over? Pretty much universally decried as unfair at best.<p>Judging someone because their <i>actions</i> negatively impact other people? The only way laws are created and society moves.<p><i>No matter what Eich does, he will be criticized. There is no way for him to win.</i><p>First, this is false. The things Eich could have done are wide and varied, and detailed in particular by me and others elsewhere in this very thread. This isn&#x27;t about &quot;winning&quot;. Critical evaluation of actions is not a game where there are winners and losers.<p><i>Why does being gay give you more protection than having a private ideology where nobody is hurt</i><p>Having a private ideology is one thing. You can think as negatively as you want to of any race, sex, orientation or gender identity. At the moment you throw money at a cause to legislate that thinking, to directly repress people you <i>don&#x27;t even know</i>, or speak about those opinions in public, <i>it ceases being private</i>. And per the freedom of speech we all get in this country, <i>everyone has the right to comment on it</i>.<p>Freedom of speech != Freedom from criticism.<p>Oh, and as mentioned elsewhere, it&#x27;s expressly illegal in this country to have civil rights unequally applied. Case law recognizes marriage as one of those rights, so even if we remove all ethics from this discussion, it&#x27;s still illegal.<p><i>It&#x27;s legal, but it&#x27;s also not conducive to a tolerant society.</i><p>And again we disagree at a basic level. Tolerance does not mean accepting intolerance. Intolerance should be named, shamed, and driven out of our society as an ugly and corrupting influence.<p>This is a favorite tactic of social regressives, mind - upon making some comment or taking some action that incites mass outrage (Akin&#x27;s &quot;legitimate rape&quot; comment from the election comes to mind, or Limbaugh&#x27;s calling a woman a &quot;slut&quot; for campaigning for birth control coverage), trying to paint the opposers as the true evil, and usually invoking these flawed, <i>incorrect</i> comparisons to freedom of speech in an attempt to turn the outrage around.<p>It seldom works.<p><i>First of all, attacking others solely based on our &quot;theories&quot; is a &quot;preemptive strike&quot;. It&#x27;s an unprovoked assault. You don&#x27;t know the truth.</i><p>One does not directly support the backers of a bill unless they want that bill passed. His reasons for doing so are irrelevant, but supporting something that unfairly targets and attempts to remove rights from people can be recognized for the evil that it is. Evil doesn&#x27;t necessarily imply malice aforethought.<p>Further, his continued support after being informed that this was seen as unacceptable has only one logical conclusion.<p><i>Challenging is fine. However, it should be done with respect of the person.</i><p>Why should I respect someone who has absolutely none for me, and wants to make my life miserable having never met me? Respect is a two way street, and Eich has not only not earned mine, he&#x27;s actively went out of his way to destroy any respect he might have had.<p>You don&#x27;t support an attack on rights on people you &quot;respect&quot;.<p><i>My theory is he & his family were being harassed from this.</i><p>Your theory has no more support than mine.<p><i>I also think he didn&#x27;t appreciate the group coercion to change his stance on an issue. Coercion is bad.</i><p>I&#x27;m sure the people who support apartheid didn&#x27;t appreciate the group coercion to change their stance either. Yet without that coercion, blacks would still be treated as three fifths of a human for the purpose of law. And women would be unable to vote or have most civil rights. And interracial marriages wouldn&#x27;t be allowed.<p>Not all coercion is bad. Sometimes coercion is necessary for progress.<p><i>Aren&#x27;t we all a little intolerant?</i><p>Thoughts and actions are different things.<p>One of my coworkers, who I respect greatly, was raised as a devout Christian and thinks that gay marriage is wrong from a moral perspective. You can&#x27;t logic someone out of something they didn&#x27;t logic themselves into in the first place - and believe me we&#x27;ve had some interesting talks bout this very topic :)<p>Do you know <i>why</i> I respect him? Because despite those beliefs, he doesn&#x27;t support legislation that codifies his moral restrictions on other people into law. He doesn&#x27;t vote for politicians that do that. He doesn&#x27;t give money to boosters of laws that would restrict my equal rights. He did what Eich does not - he recognizes that what people do in their private lives has no effect on him or his morals. He doesn&#x27;t attempt to legislate his moral restrictions in this matter so that everyone must abide by his narrower version of allowed conduct.<p>We&#x27;re getting more into legislative philosophy here, but in this country, generally things are allowed unless there is a good reason for them not to be. Restrictions need to have a good reason, and religious beliefs and personal moral qualms are not a good reason for restricting the conduct of the population. Even less so when that comes to restricting a recognized right.<p><i>I think most supports don&#x27;t approach it from a standpoint of hate.</i><p>Maybe, maybe not. But I can only judge what they <i>do</i> - and the fact that they want to treat me as a second class citizen is a case of either ignorance (they don&#x27;t know that this is a big deal, why this is important, why change what isn&#x27;t broken), arrogance (they feel they have the right to impose their moral restrictions on the world), disdain (they actually feel that I am strange, broken person that should not have my weirdness recognized by law), or religion (they feel that by denying me this right, they are preventing me from sinning against their deity of choice)<p>All four of those things reflect pretty badly on the person supporting the law. And you&#x27;re probably tired of hearing me beat this particular drum, but the same four failings I just mentioned played heavily in the interracial marriage fight many years ago... which is why I find it very puzzling that someone can support interracial marriage (or not speak out against it) and then turn around and oppose gay marriage. Puzzling to the point it calls the supposed pure motives of the person into question.<p><i>Also, the tone of justifiers of this demonization seems off.</i><p>You keep bringing up this word, &quot;demonize&quot;, &quot;disrespect&quot; and so on. Why do you think that morally judging Eich&#x27;s actions is either of these things? I&#x27;d bet that if you were to poll the people who spoke out against him, you&#x27;d find very little &quot;hate&quot; for him, and a great deal of exactly what I&#x27;ve mentioned here, the 3 facts why this is unacceptable, based not on his motivations, but on his actions.",1396902405

The exact same behavioral interface means there is no specialization: every message looks the same. We can compose programs (behavior) by hooking up objects/messages as opposed to coding them. This is because we have 100% encapsulation[2]. We need to know nothing about the internal working of an object since it has no parameterized subroutines.<p>The abstraction for passing information between sub-systems are these messages (every object is a message) as opposed to parameterized subroutines.<p>[1] We could call it message-oriented programming (not to be confused with message-oriented software/frameworks).<p>[2] Even a single parameterized method leaks some of the internal workings of an object and leads to specialization of the objects interface. This also leads to tightly coupled software systems.",1396901289

7549059,comment,7548133,7548133,9,0,crazypyro,,,"As someone who just went through the internship process with a few different companies, I find this fascinating. This is pretty much what I expected going into the experience (multiple interviews, at least 1-2 coding questions/examples to do, a test maybe). Out of the few companies I interviewed from, I had nothing as intense as this. The majority of them didn&#x27;t even test coding/theory knowledge at all. They were just simple interviews that lasted 2-5 hours. The hardest part of any interview was a freaking mental acuity standardized test I took at the company who I&#x27;ll be working for that wasn&#x27;t hard, so take the term &quot;hardest&quot; lightly. Good news is I accepted an offer at that smaller engineering company! A good portion of my interviews were for engineering companies because of the employers my university attracts, so that could also have affected the technical parts of the interview.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about how many interviews and how long this process is. I know some of my fellow students would be completely blindsided by such a long process unless it was clearly laid out. The compensation seems nice from the companies that hire around here (I go to a predominately STEM university in the Mid-West and all the companies I interviewed with came to our career fair in February, which is pretty late in the process). I&#x27;ll make just over half that much monthly, but it&#x27;ll be June-December and in STL. The highest I&#x27;ve heard from my classmates is 7k/month, but that was from Exxon Mobile and there was very little technical parts of the interview. He did have to take a hair test for drugs though. Ideally, I believe most of the larger corporations, like Boeing, Monsanto, etc, (like the article said) start interviews after the fall career fair.<p>Another side note about compensation: Seems to be pretty wide spread between 13-30/hr (without adding in housing) at companies around the Midwest. I don&#x27;t exactly have the greatest academic credentials though (3.0 gpa), so some of the more selective companies may pay more, especially for graduating seniors. Exxon-Mobile being the highest, Boeing right in the middle of that range, and a local ISP looking for a non-coding cs major on the low end for the curious.<p>edit: Just adding in details as I get time.<p>FORGOT THE MOST ANNOYING THING<p>I was given the offer on Friday and he needed an answer on Monday, else he was going to extend the offer to other candidates. This was pretty obnoxious to me, but I ended up taking the offer because I was interested in it more than my other potential offers, but seriously, recruiters, a weekend is not enough time to get back to you with an offer, especially when other companies are asking you to keep them notified with enough time that they can either speed things up or not waste time on a candidate.",1396901113

It can&#x27;t be as simple as &quot;civil rights&quot; and &quot;marriage equality&quot;; for example,  (first) cousin marriage is important to many groups—indeed, in Islam cousin marriage is not only allowed, it&#x27;s often preferred [1]—but it is illegal in most states [2]. And yet, I rarely see advocates of &quot;marriage equality&quot; get all lathered up over this issue. Are advocates of &quot;marriage equality&quot; in favor of legalizing cousin marriage? If not, why not? If so, why have they not worked harder to achieve it?<p>I see no way to resolve this paradox from within the context of progressive ideology, but it&#x27;s trivial to explain once you view it from the outside. As the example of cousin marriage shows, the behavior of Eich&#x27;s purgers <i>is not</i> consistent with mere &quot;civil rights&quot; and &quot;marriage equality&quot;, but it <i>is</i> consistent with signaling tribal membership, seizing political power, and smashing their enemies.<p>As it happens, right now gay marriage is an effective club with which progressives can beat conservatives. At some point, this may also be the case for cousin marriage—I can easily imagine opponents of cousin marriage someday being branded &quot;Islamophobes&quot;, just as today opponents of gay marriage are branded &quot;homophobes&quot;.

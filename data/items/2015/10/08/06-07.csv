They&#x27;re asking for input going forward, so take a few minutes to express your concerns about workflow and maybe it will be a better product for it.<p>I believe they are doing quite a bit of stacking, as they say they are processing up to 130 megapixels from 10 sensors to get the final image. There should definitely be a dynamic range improvement. I hope they can somehow apply their processing to video streams and provide a wide dynamic range (maybe even HDR) video, but I&#x27;d be surprised if they can do more than provide a cellphone-like 4K stream from a single sensor.<p>Focus speed shouldn&#x27;t be an issue. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s using tiny cellphone-sized camera sensors, so even at the f/2.4 printed around the lens, they&#x27;ll have massive depth of field. It looks like they even have the DOF printed on each lens: 10cm-infinity for the 35mm lenses, 40cm-inf for the 70mm, and 100cm-inf for the 150mm. Any focusing will be done computationally at post-processing time.<p>I&#x27;m interested in the concept; I just hope they&#x27;re a little more developer-friendly then Lytro turned out to be. I know there&#x27;s a lot of proprietary secret sauce going on with the computational post-processing, but if they can open up their system just a bit to let the crowd in to poke around, there&#x27;s probably a lot of unique creative opportunities.",1444287224

What&#x27;s important to this conversation is that drawing from the the group ∪{N(x), ∀x} will unquestionably give you the best bridge designs and limiting yourself to some N(i) will tend to give you a worse subset of designs.<p>> I don&#x27;t however think that good ideas have been &#x27;ignored&#x27;.<p>Think what you like, you are simply wrong here as a historical fact and basic logic. The most obvious counterexamples are productive people who, due to discrimination, had their careers ended (e.g. Alan Turing, Jewish scientists killed in the holocaust) but it should be equally obvious that after given access, people from previously excluded groups had valuable contributions that would otherwise have taken longer to discover.  I can&#x27;t believe I have to spell this out...<p>> Even if so, the way the initial argument was presented seems to imply that the bridges cannot stand on it&#x27;s own and needs others to help it... It implies that [unprivileged group] people cannot succeed on their own ideas.<p>You can keep writing that word salad as much as you like, it&#x27;s not true. The fact is good bridge builders from [unprivileged group] were being excluded.  Despite your fantasies to the contrary, you were not living in a meritocracy where [privleged group] earned all the bridge contracts.  You were living in a degenerate system  where [group 1] rigged the system so that [group 2] and [group 3] were unable to win contracts even if their bridges were better.<p>> If you think that is not the case, then I would like you to name at least 2 fields without a prominent [unprivileged group] person with leading theories and ideas.

10351234,comment,10346952,10348981,0,0,grkvlt,,,"I think (based on your child comment too) that you&#x27;re conflating AWS and Amazon. Amazon sells things and also allows you to sell things, and that creates a conflict of interest, which has apperently caused problems. I am unsure how much of the problem was direct maliciousness on Amazon&#x27;s part, admittedly - I suspect naivete on the part of some marketplace users, imagining that Amazon would never sell the same product as them, or would never lower the price of a competing product. Certainly it would seem obvious not to try and compete with Amazon on price or availability, you will always lose eventually.<p>However, AWS is a different thing altogether - it is a set of services that can be used to run parts of your business. Now, if your business involves simply reselling those services, or is predicated the availability and pricing of one of those services being a major part of the value for a service you sell (i.e. the value you add is marginal, with the majority of the product or service&#x27;s value residing in the service AWS provides) then you are again in a situation where AWS may also decide to offer the same service, and will probably be able to do so more cheaply and profitably.<p>Again, this would not be a malicious act or directed attack on your business through inside information, and it seems naiive to assume so. You must have been able to determine a market existed and a need could be fulfilled profitably by providing this service, there is no reason a company like AWS could not reach the same conclusion with its vastly larger amount of resources. The possibility of this sort of thing happening should have been determined during due diligence and market analysis anyway, so it should not be a surprise if it happens.<p>But companies in traditional lines of business using AWS to save money, or using AWS to build a product where the value provided to the customer is inherent in the service provided, not the infrastructure used, are going to be fine. Nobody worries about the electricity company stealing your idea for a product run using electricity...",1444286393

The next step is 20 fps and if you were even allowed to ship a game like that it would not make any money so you would likely get fired anyway.<p>You will do very unsafe things to stuff as much as possible into a game&#x27;s frame because your competition is already doing it and your designers demand it.

10351191,comment,10347599,10350103,0,0,bburshteyn,,,"Hi Michael,<p>I tried to address each of your questions one after another below. As a general remark, this 1.0.5 is an alpha version, some things will be changed in the upcoming updates, including those that harden the code.<p>An attacker may want to get individual files saved in the store for any reason. Some of them are explained in the Guide and on the website:<p>&quot;Just encrypting the file content and its name, without preventing its identification, still jeopardizes security. In case the attacker gets a hold on the ciphertext, they might succeed in decrypting the ciphertext. Alternatively, they might blackmail the data owner despite being unable to decrypt the data. Also, encryption methods considered safe today might become unsafe tomorrow because of the progress in the deciphering techniques. In some cases, the attacker may apply unlimited computing resources thus succeeding in a brute force attack. Ultimately, the attacker may possess a secret algorithm that deciphers the seemingly impregnable encryption scheme. Therefore, having the attacker being able to identify the encrypted data is potentially as dangerous as having the attacker succeeding in stealing cleartext or deciphering encrypted data.&quot;<p>Cryptomove data passwords are usually not kept in memory but only used to generate symmetric encryption keys. The data keys are used only once on the client -- for encryption and decryption, and then discarded unless the client works in &#x27;trust&#x27; mode where it does keep the keys in the client memory for each next get/put operation, until the time the user switches the trust mode off. When the trust is off, the user must enter the password(s) for each next get/put kind of operation.<p>Each server keeps its server password in memory. Currently, that virtual memory is swappable, but in the next version (coming very soon) the key will be stored in the locked physical memory. In addition, plans exist to make sure the daemons are not dumpable or amenable to ptrace() calls (to prevent debuggers and other processes to peek inside). As I have said before, this is an alpha version -- the very first proof of concept, although we are aware of numerous enhancements that must still be applied.<p>Hello language has an interface to encrypt its network traffic, but that interface is not used in the current Cryptomove version.<p>Obviously, in general many different technologies can be used to build the same software. Cryptomove is built using Hello because this language allows for a convenient transfer of bulk and individual data as copy parameters in its remote method calls and return values, because it allows for convenient scheduling on multiple threads and for controlled processing of asynchronous events. Other Hello features used in Cryptomove include native interaction with C++ which allows for reuse any system calls and auxiliary C/C++ libraries.<p>Cryptomove protects against the attack that attempts to find any number of individual files in the store because even stealing the encrypted data poses a security risk as noted in the above quote. Unlike TRueCrypt, Cryptomove does not work on the disk or partition level, but places data parts inside encrypted files within a file system. Advantage of this approach is that the data store owners can employ any file-based management system or policy to store and manage the data, including distribution data policies between different levels of storage, increasing/decreasing store capacity, providing online backup/restore, etc.<p>Thank you very much for your kind words -- we really tried very hard for this first alpha release to be useful in tryouts. More things are still to come, including those I spelled out above, others mentioned in <a href=""http://cryptomove.com/news/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cryptomove.com/news/</a>.<p>Regarding your last comments about Hello. There are a lot of examples of Hello programs in the Hello User Guide and on the website itself (<a href=""http://www.amsdec.com/documentation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amsdec.com/documentation/</a>). The white paper at <a href=""http://www.amsdec.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hellowhitepaper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amsdec.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hellowhitep...</a> explains the rationale behind developing Hello and its design goals.<p>When one embeds a C++ code inside a Hello program, the C++ code has read/write access to the surrounding Hello data. Hello has no spelled out memory management policy, but the current runtime uses ref count. You are correct: if one is not careful, one can ruin memory by unsafe embedded C++ code. Still, Hello can prohibit execution of any portion of the embedded C++ code at runtime, also disable embedding C++ code at translation time in protected packages. It seems many &#x27;safe&#x27; systems allow for embedding lower level programming languages, say Java allows native C, C allows assembler, etc. -- Hello is not different in this regard. All of them rely on the programmer being careful with the code at hand.<p>Hope the above helps to clear at least some of your questions.<p>Best Regards, Boris.",1444285022

10351162,comment,10346985,10350035,0,0,asgard1024,,,"I like that idea too, but what I like even more is the bold originality in it. I think hackers who make these new programming languages should try to be original, and experiment with weird things that actually help them solve whatever problems they feel they have during development, because language is pretty much a programmer&#x27;s user interface.<p>And also this particular feature is close to my heart, because what I would like to see as a feature(s) in programming languages that the programmer would only supply the data schema, and compiler selects the actual data structure based on run time performance characteristics of the program.",1444284215

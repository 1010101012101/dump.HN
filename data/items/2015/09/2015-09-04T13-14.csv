You can&#x27;t wander around much, so it feels less like a world and more like a movie where you occasionally help the plot along by clicking on things.<p>The original LucasArts games were only occasionally like this. They invited a lot of trial and error (some of it extremely unintuitive; Zak McKracken had some of those), exploring areas you couldn&#x27;t access yet, and so on. They were difficult, and they never held your hand.<p>Unfortunately, this dumbed-down form seems like a fairly new trend in games. (Double Fine&#x27;s The Cave, which looked fantastic, failed partly because it was just too simplistic.) I suppose they are afraid of losing audiences if they are too hard.",1441375183

10170421,comment,10169937,10170314,0,0,porker,,,"> When you know the requirements, model the data first. Data comes first because data lasts longer than code. Flexible data lets you do more with less code. And if the data is very well defined you can usually use fewer language features, too - which is a bonus to maintenance later. Think of features in data terms first and lifecycles later.<p>Boy am I SO GLAD to see someone say that! I think of my approach as &quot;Data-Driven Development&quot;, rooted in my days of scientific programming. The data is what matters. On my largest project to date (8 months, entire business system) I spent 25% of the time just on the data store schema. Needless to say it worked & evolved without issue over 5 years.<p>Yet (at least in the PHP community) the fad is currently Domain-Driven Development, BDD, and architectures (&quot;another travesty of reflection and classes-on-top-of-classes&quot;).<p>> The maintainers will feel like geniuses because they&#x27;ll keep finding clever ways to use the existing data better<p>Oh yes, that&#x27;s how my oldest systems are.

Here are some points that I&#x27;ve picked up along the way:<p>- Remind yourself that you are not only generating value when you actually write code. When you take a walk and think about the problem, draw stuff on paper and so on, this is still work. You are still doing exactly your job.<p>- This gets hard when coming up with a design takes longer than usual. It&#x27;s likely that you have run into a complex problem without knowing it. Endurance & patience is key here.<p>- Attack from different angles, don&#x27;t consider the time wasted if you try something and then end up throwing it away, you will have learned something, even if it just eliminating one possible design option.<p>After you are through it, you might end up cherishing the experience.",1441374957

10170387,comment,10169430,10170196,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"> Here (Europe) buying a pre-paid card and a phone separatly is the most cost effective option, isn&#x27;t it the same in the States?<p>Where in Europe? In the Netherlands all the calculations I ran every 2 years showed anywhere from slight to major discounts for 2 year contracts paired with a phone, and that&#x27;s without discounting future cash payments (or valuing money you&#x27;re paying upfront, either way).<p>It&#x27;s still beneficial to phone companies because it makes phones look cheaper than they actually are ($30 a month feels more doable than $720 upfront) and so it&#x27;s probably easier to sell a $30 a month cost for 2 years than selling a $720 cost even though (ignoring time value of money) they&#x27;re the same.<p>And then if you add say a $20 phone plan, it&#x27;s basically: want to pay $50 a month, or $30 a month and pay $720 now? The latter is probably easier to swallow for most and easier to sell, but that&#x27;s of course entirely different from being a scam.<p>So for example, the Netherlands. Apple&#x27;s shop sells the iphone for 700 euros. KPN (one of the 3 networks) has a one-time 53 euro, 2 year 54 euro plan, so 56 euros per month on average and the phone & plan is included.<p>A similar plan with the same KPN is €32.50. Add that to the 700 euro cost of the phone over 24 months (€29) and you&#x27;re at 62 euros, vs 56 euros, more than 140 euros of discount and that&#x27;s without valuing the financial/convenience value of not having to pay 700 euros upfront.<p>And this is literally the first, standard plan I looked into, no cherrypicking. (5gb a month plan, no limit calling/texting). Perhaps you could find different results but I&#x27;ve, purely as part of my buying decisions when I bought my own phone, ran these calculations here about every year or every two years at different carriers and it&#x27;s consistent. So I&#x27;d say, it depends on the country.<p>As for prepaid, it&#x27;s absolutely horrible here in the Netherlands. It&#x27;s 30c per minute for calling, 16c per text, 25c per megabyte. Not kidding. That&#x27;s KPN by the way, the same that offers the above plans. That means if you call say 300 minutes per month, that&#x27;s 90 euros already. And that&#x27;s just a little over calling 1 hour per week. Call 30 minutes per week and it&#x27;s 36 euros. Add a 700 euro iPhone and you&#x27;re already well over any KPN plan you can get, and you haven&#x27;t used any data or texts yet. The 5 gigabytes of data the plan has would cost you 1250 euros per month if used in prepaid. Even using just 500 megabytes per month (my plan 5 years ago) would cost you 125 euros per month, prepaid.<p>KPN&#x27;s prepaid is disproportionately shitty though, it&#x27;s meant for old people really. Like my grandfather has it and he mostly just calls for cabs, emergencies etc. T-Mobile&#x27;s rate in the Netherlands is more sensible, but still 5c per megabyte. A 1 gigabyte monthly data usage still costs you 50 euros, but such a 1 gigabyte plan would cost you less than 20 euros with minutes included. Prepaid here is never, ever a good option, unless you&#x27;re an extremely light user like my grandfather, or someone who travels tons and doesn&#x27;t return (as you can freeze plans for vacations etc).",1441374803

Even well-respected programmers who&#x27;ve authored tons of books and given talks do not sit down and 1-shot a program. Elegant programs are the result of refining and designing.<p>The earlier in the development process you get to the refactoring and isolating minimal testable components, the less of a tangle you have between components to refactor; it&#x27;s a lot like the wire tangles we&#x27;re all so familiar with). This not only means less refactoring, but it also means that the existing code is easier to understand.<p>The tests are code. Treat the tests just like the rest of the code. I prefer test-first but if you want to pull your cart in front of your horse then go for it.<p>If the code is not tested I&#x27;d recommend testing it. There are really only 3 options to go from untested code base to tested code base:
- Try to put tests under existing code (often inefficient)
- Refactor the system incrementally as time goes on and features are added and bugs are fixed (slow process but over time test coverage grows)
- Throw it out and start over (ouch but... greenfield; if you do this you should _NOT_ add <i>any</i> new features to the live/production system or you&#x27;ll end up in a rat race between the two forever)<p>Also if you&#x27;re able to take any time away (preferably measured in days) the fresh perspective might help too.

Software isn&#x27;t expected to last very long, and when it does it&#x27;s both miraculous and ugly, as the tools and techniques become more and more arcane over time. If the solution you develop can satisfy all parties for an extended period, it is as correct as you can hope for - and part of that involves choosing a technical process that can be kept running in an environment of some ineptitude.<p>When you know the requirements, model the data first. Data comes first because data lasts longer than code. Flexible data lets you do more with less code. And if the data is very well defined you can usually use fewer language features, too - which is a bonus to maintenance later. Think of features in data terms first and lifecycles later.<p>The best-practices cruft you&#x27;ve learned over time - that&#x27;s going to have to be sacrificed when you identify ways that your designs can be simpler. You may identify a pattern that is useful but not &quot;with the grain&quot; of the languages you&#x27;re using. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s wrong, just that you&#x27;re breaking past some known boundaries of programming.<p>As you know, most projects get dirty in order to ship. Not doing that means doing basic research to find the ideal technique, whereas there&#x27;s always room to tolerate a few more hacks, global flags, mystery-meat callbacks, etc. Your best defense is for the data to be so good that all the code can remain disposable and the system will still turn out more-or-less the same way if rewritten from scratch, with a different-but-equally-awful set of hacks and kludges.<p>Under the pressure of strong data, code that sticks around after several cycles of disposal becomes the library code by default - and internal APIs will become strong enough to prevent a &quot;lava layer&quot; from taking root, because they&#x27;ll consistently solve the immediate problem faster than any wrapper layer. The maintainers will feel like geniuses because they&#x27;ll keep finding clever ways to use the existing data better, instead of mashing out another travesty of reflection and classes-on-top-of-classes.<p>If data isn&#x27;t sufficient, you may also have to define a protocol. Protocols, if they work correctly, compact the state management into a small part of the app, and leave you with more data.",1441374294

In reflected XSS, its the page you sent the request to. With &quot;Stored&quot; or &quot;Delayed&quot; XSS, it&#x27;s somewhere else in the app or even a different app entirely.<p>Building this mapping when input and output points are in different areas, and doing that automatically has 2 challenges:<p>- Clobbering your input<p>- Finding the output point.<p>Clobbering input is something automated tools are terrible at. Let&#x27;s say you are auditing a &quot;save my settings&quot; functionality in an e-com store, but the address values you save aren&#x27;t actually displayed until later in the checkout process (i.e. you are dealing with a stored XSS). Let&#x27;s say the vulnerable input is the state name (devs often forget to validate input when the input is a dropdown, because they forget people can make that input be anything they want).<p>You submit an attack string for the address, and valid input for state and zip. You don&#x27;t see it reflected. You then do valid input for address and zip, but state has an attack string. Nice, but that doesn&#x27;t appear until to later in the app. As an attacker, you don&#x27;t know this, so you see its not a reflected XSS, and you do a 3rd attempt and submit valid input for address and state, and attack the zip. You have now clobbered your attack string that you submitted against the State with a valid, normal input for the state. When you get deeper into the app and see the state returned in the checkout process, it wouldn&#x27;t be rendering your attack probe. That got clobbered by the valid input.<p>Unless you inject an attack token, and then sweep the entire site for that token, you won&#x27;t find most stored/delayed XSS. Probe address field, crawl rest of site looking for your probe. Probe State field, crawl rest of site looking for your probe. This is super time consuming to do.<p>Automated tools suck at this. Humans are a better, because they understand context. I know that an address associated with an account is a likely stored XSS vector, and I have a gut feeling about where in the app the address will be rendered. Knowing context helps you also prune the number of inputs you should test for stored XSS. Unless I find an admin or analytics area in a site, I&#x27;m not going to bother doing this work to test if an HTTP header like User-Agent or Referer [sic] is a stored XSS vector as it is highly unlikely those inputs are reflected out somewhere else in the site.<p>If you have an output in another app its super hard. Sleepy Puppy tries to get around this by having the XSS payload &quot;phone home&quot; and pull an external JS file for a site they control to register where the output point is. While this is the best attempt I&#x27;ve seen, it has short comings. CSP defeats this. Also, it means the vulnerable input has to allow far more more characters to do the attack. spaces, quotes, parens etc cannot get filtered or encoded for the various Sleepy Puppy payloads to work.<p>This is a hard problem to solve. I&#x27;m glad NetFlix open sourced this.",1441373101

What&#x27;s in your favour is that you recognise it, so you will probably be able to do something about it.<p>Systems grow over time.  At the beginning, they are simple, which means that they are forgiving.  If you make a mistake, it is easy to see and correct.  As the software grows, it gets progressively more complex.  Problems hide for a long time and when they present themselves it is often very difficult to see the actual problem.<p>What I&#x27;d like to do is challenge you to look at it a bit differently.  Think about the number of lines of code in the OS, system libraries, language, libraries, frameworks, etc that actually go into your code.  Even if you only write 2 lines of code, there are probably hundreds of thousands of lines that your 2 lines are sitting on top of.  Why are your 2 lines easy to understand?<p>Obviously because there is a great separation between the complexity of the underlying systems and your code.  What you need to be able to do is to provide that same separation in your own code.<p>As you mentioned that you don&#x27;t work with others, I will recommend some other approaches.  However, if they don&#x27;t work, I recommend that you change to an office job where you can get the mentorship you require before you leave the field altogether.  15 years is a lot of learning to give up.<p>#1: Read good code.  One of the biggest problems that programmers have is that they rely on their own code for examples of &quot;good code&quot;.  You are at a huge advantage because you recognise that you need to improve your code.  What should you be reading?  Read library code from whatever libraries you are using.  As you are doing &quot;web development&quot;, I would advise you to shy away from reading the source code of frameworks like Rails, but rather read the underlying class libraries for the languages you use.  If you are not using languages that are open source, then it will make your life much more difficult, but try your best to find open source and free software on the internet to study.<p>#2. TDD.  Every time.  All the time.  Not BDD (although BDD is an excellent practice in its own right).  You want to do TDD.  This will force you to think about your interfaces and to decompose.  There are many books about TDD.  Some of them are good and some of them are bad.  Read Test Driven Development: By Example by Kent Beck.  It is probably not the best book on TDD, but it will give you the basics without confusing you.<p>If you are working with legacy systems and don&#x27;t know how to TDD with those legacy systems, read: Working Effectively With Legacy Code by Michael Feathers.  It is a very, very difficult book.  Learn it all.<p>You may hate TDD.  Many people do, but using it will make you a better programmer.  Personally, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s bad  if you abandon it eventually, but master it before you do.  This will simplify the process for you and break it down so that you can consider things in more manageable pieces.  It will move you away from &quot;Just Works&quot; because it is god awfully slow (or at least it feels that way).  Just pay attention to the effect it has on your code.<p>From where you seem to be now, to where you want to be, I estimate you&#x27;ve got 2-5 years of effort.  Don&#x27;t get discouraged if it doesn&#x27;t come right away.  This is a discipline where you can get orders of magnitude better over time.  Try to be as patient as possible.<p>I hope this helps.",1441372434

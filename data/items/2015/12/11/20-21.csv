I&#x27;ve worked in some places where the QA team was useless, meaningless red tape to get your stuff deployed. They wouldn&#x27;t do much but sign off on deployment <i>at some point</i>, yet bore no responsibility if shit hit the fan. In these cases, they really were just an unnecessary cost and you learned pretty quickly to make sure your tests were in place, that you were testing for the right things, and so on.<p>But then there were the other QA teams. The people that would just reject your stuff outright if it didn&#x27;t have tests (no matter if it worked) and when the tests passed they would look at things truly from a customer perspective. They would ask really uncomfortable questions, not just to developers, but to designers and business alike. They had a mindset that was different from those creating things; they were the devil&#x27;s advocate. These people did much, much more good than harm, and they are few and far between. Unfortunately, while I believe they were incredibly valuable, business thought otherwise when cuts came around..",1449867589

10719986,comment,10700766,10718388,0,0,humanrebar,,,"There are a lot of particular points to respond to here, but it seems your general critique is that treating the Bible as truth can be circular reasoning and that people are smart enough to twist any holy book to evil. The Bible actually agrees on these points and asks the readers to test groups and people against objectively good things to see if there is truth in action.<p>Look for: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control, appreciation of truth. These things are sometimes disdained and derided, but they&#x27;re never <i>wrong</i>. On the other hand, be suspicious of: hate, abuse, envy, boasting, arrogance, rudeness, insistence on one&#x27;s own way, irritability, resentfulness, and celebration in wrongdoing. It may seem odd to you, but a valid criticism of a Christian&#x27;s ideas is pointing out where there out of line with these lists. A point delivered with irritability is a weak point for a Christian to make. And I guess you could extrapolate that to ideas and books... at least how they generally affect people.<p>Edit: Regarding who has to prove God exists... I think nobody does. I don&#x27;t have to prove it. Neither does He. I think it&#x27;s better for you if you accept it, but that&#x27;s your choice. You could ask God to prove Himself before you believe, I suppose. But understand that He is the creator of the universe and He feels He has already gone above and beyond for us. But He has also done amazing things to prove to people that He cares for them. I don&#x27;t see how it could hurt to ask.<p>There are good answers to your specific objections and concerns, and I&#x27;m interested in sharing thoughts on them, but there seems to be more contest than sharing here. I&#x27;m pretty sure continuing won&#x27;t benefit you any, and I&#x27;m pretty sure there isn&#x27;t an audience that would benefit from me responding to your points. But thanks for the discussion. If I didn&#x27;t appreciate strong criticism, I would have some particular pride issues to work out.<p>I do think that perhaps you aren&#x27;t exposed to orthodox Christians on a regular basis, so you may not really appreciate how the Bible really works on people. If you&#x27;re interested in more diversity in what information you&#x27;re exposed to, I&#x27;d recommend finding some friends who think the Bible is fundamentally true. If that doesn&#x27;t interest you, I understand.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;ve prayed for good things in your future, and that God tries again to convince you that there are better things out there for you.<p>Enjoy your weekend.",1449867574

Many times the development team puts in some feature that doesn&#x27;t have any visible output for the testers to test - rather it is some internal change or improvement.<p>The QA department, then responsible for testing this new &quot;feature&quot; will most likely go off of a script that was sent to them by the developers to verify the old and new behavior, going on some metric that perhaps they don&#x27;t really understand.<p>In some cases, the QA may actually have to rely on a tool actually built by the developers to test the feature. So in some cases the QA, not being software developers and not responsible for actually reviewing the code, will have to somewhat go on faith that the scripts and tools provided by the developers are accurate.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that means the engineers were responsible at VW, but it does explain how something could slip through the checks-and-balances that have been set up.",1449867526

10719784,comment,10719080,10719551,0,0,winter_blue,,,"In the US, generally, the company applies for your visa. So you need to get a job offer first from a company that loves you so much that they&#x27;ll apply for a visa for you, and wait the typical 6 months it takes for the visa to get processed.<p>The best US work visa right now is the H1B. It lets you change jobs to any company (in your field), provided that company is willing to do a small amount of work to &quot;transfer&quot; the H1B visa.<p>There&#x27;s another visa called the L1 visa for intra-company trasnfer, but it sucks. It locks you down to the company. You can&#x27;t change jobs, and you get kicked out if you ever get let go from that company.<p>You&#x27;ve asked your question at a good time. Every year, companies apply for the H1B visa on April 1. There is a limit of 85,000 visas per year, and if the gov receives more than 85,000 H1B applications on April 1, they perform a computer randomized lottery and randomly select 85,000.<p>If you want to move to the US, this is the time. As a UK citizen, you can visit the US without a visa, and stay for up to 3 months. Ideally, fly in on Jan 1, and stay for the full 3 months. You could sublet an apartment for 3 months on craigslist. Then apply, apply, apply. While traveling on ESTA, do not say you&#x27;re going to apply for jobs. It is a legal grey area, and the interpretation of the law varies on whether looking for H1B employment is considered &quot;immigrant intent&quot; (as the H1B is a <i>temporary</i> 6-year non-immigrant visa). What this means is that there is the possibility that you could get denied entry at the U.S. airport you arrived in under Immigration and Nationality Act Section 214(b) for having &quot;immigrant intent&quot;, get sent back, and receive a 5-year ban.<p>If you are a good software developer, you should have no problem finding a company willing to apply for you. Once a company says they&#x27;ll apply for you, you just need to go back to the UK and wait for the results of the lottery.<p>You&#x27;ll know if you won the lottery by June/July. Last year, they got 233,000 application, and they chose 85,000 out of that randomly. You could say your odds of winning are 1 in 3. There might be even more applications this year.<p>If you don&#x27;t win the lottery, there&#x27;s two options:<p>1) Re-attempt this whole process, and try the lottery every year. You&#x27;d have to move to the US for at least a month or two, ideally in January, February or March.<p>2) You could get a job at a US company in the UK, and ask for a transfer to the US. If it works out, you&#x27;ll be in the US on a L-1 visa. This visa doesn&#x27;t allow you to change jobs, and requires you to leave the country if you ever leave the company. But if your job is with a large stable company, that shouldn&#x27;t be too much to worry about. Now there&#x27;s two routes you can go down from here:<p>2a) Ask your company (i.e. the sponsor of your L-1 transfer visa) to apply for an employment-based green card. The green card process can last anywhere from 1 year to 6 or 7 years (or more), depending on what category you were put in, and what country you were born in. You are, again, locked to your company during this period.<p>2b) You can looks for jobs in January-February-March period while you&#x27;re in the US on the L-1 visa. The company will have to apply for an H1B visa for you. If you win the lottery, they switch you over from your old L1 to your new H1B. Once you&#x27;re approved for the H1B, you can switch to other jobs fairly freely. (There&#x27;s still paperwork to change jobs on the H1B, but 70% of tech companies in the US are willing to do it.)",1449866089

If you define your terms slightly differently a mathematician may be annoyed but he will recognize if your overall work is valid.<p>It&#x27;s also true on an individual level.

Poldrack says that’s surprising: “If anything we would have predicted that if you’re tired and caffeinated, connectivity would have gone down.” Figuring out why this effect occurred might be a fruitful avenue for research.&quot;<p>It is very intriguing and interesting that neural connectivity in systems of movement and vision is increased when one is fasting. My speculation is that those neural activities are handed down from our early ancestors. Perhaps when we were hungry, our brain is actively scanning our surrounding areas for ways of obtaining sustenance.",1449864307

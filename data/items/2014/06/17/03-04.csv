I promise you that if you take a beginner class in lindy hop, it will be the most fun you have had in years.<p>It&#x27;s totally unintimidating. Lessons usually run for 6 weeks and you go once a week. Usually the teachers will have everyone form a big circle and you will rotate through partners. By the end of the hour, you will have danced with 20 or 30 different people. When the instructor says rotate, you go to the next person, introduce yourself and then dance to an old 40s swing song for a minute or so. There is nothing in the world like real partner dancing (unlike that embarrassing thing that people call rock and roll dancing).<p>It&#x27;s totally fun and you will make QUALITY friends. Not a bunch of drunk bar flys. Most swing venues do not serve alcohol. It really is a small part of the total experience.<p>Even if you are married, this would make a great date night. Give it a try for 6 weeks, you will love it.

I&#x27;ve been in the dot-com start up pressure cooker, I&#x27;m in another start up right now. The one I was part of over a decade ago needed to pivot and failed, miserably. It didn&#x27;t have to, but it did. We had great people and a solid foundation, but needed to reorient. We didn&#x27;t due to management, and it went tits up in no time. Tens of millions of dollars flushed down the toilet. The one I&#x27;m part of now, we&#x27;ve only spent a little over $100k, and after a couple setbacks, we&#x27;re realizing a pivot is needed, but one that actually will save the core of the company and make it more successful.<p>Scott Adams comes in and discovers the idea of pivoting, paints it as a startup concept that he can see through and discover how it&#x27;s being misused, and writes another pretentious blog post about it. Pivoting has been a business tool for centuries. Nintendo used to make playing cards, Nokia made rubber products and paper, Berkshire Hathaway was a textile mill, AmEx did mail. They all pivoted when the time called for it.<p>What these startups are doing is realizing they have an idea that for whatever reason, they can&#x27;t pull off. Maybe it&#x27;s a bad idea, maybe it&#x27;s the wrong team for the job, whatever. So rather than break up the company, they SAVE THE COMPANY. Just like a human who changes jobs if the need arises, so do companies, which are run by people. They get together as a team, and figure out what they did wrong, and what they can do to fix it, and pivot. They come up with a new plan to save the company.<p>And now Scott Adams makes the realizations that some startups are based on bad ideas, that some react to the market to survive, and that others have taken this as a lesson to realize the objective is to find success rather than hold on to your core idea until you die. And he shares this with us as the benevolent braintrust he is. Scott, open a business textbook written anytime since 1900. This is not a unique nor new idea.<p>Oh, and the Internet IS a technology, it&#x27;s one that enables many things, like psychological/market experiments, but it&#x27;s still a technology. Don&#x27;t think so hard next time, Scott. You&#x27;ll hurt yourself.",1402976595

However, as I say this I wonder whether my bias is showing... against Microsoft (who I am frankly not very fond of) vs Google (who I like much more).<p>It is clear that with their investment in the patent troll, Microsoft is evil. However, Google has tried to hold up the evil companies by using standards essential patents as well. I can try to justify it in my mind but is Google really better than Microsoft? We have yet to see (as far as I know) Google sue anybody but isn&#x27;t having a trove of nuclear weapons enough of a reason to distrust someone? It is not like they have to blatantly display it for it to be a part of negotiations (might be hand wrangling if you&#x27;re on the wrong end of it).<p>I am conflicted because the more I think about it, the more I doubt my previous assertion. A pledge to not use frivolous patents in an aggressive way is not sufficient. However, wouldn&#x27;t I rather Google or Twitter hold a frivolous patent knowing they likely won&#x27;t sue me directly (I have very small dreams and I doubt I&#x27;d ever show up on their radar).

7902737,comment,7900892,7901544,8,0,ww520,,,"The patent language is not too bad.  Defeating a patent is not too hard.  There are specific terms and patterns to the language, just like a programming language.  It&#x27;s often quite logical.  It&#x27;s just like reading another programming language.<p>A claim is just a list of &quot;AND&quot; conditions, i.e. all the conditions must be met for the claim to be asserted.  To defeat a patent claim, it&#x27;s a matter of adding enough variance in your code to defeat ONE of the conditions.<p>I will demonstrate the decrypting of claim 1.  The other claims are just dependent claims of 1 to make the whole thing looks meatier.  If claim 1 is defeated, all other claims are irrelevant.<p>Claim 1 basically saying a user issues a query with two parameters on two tables to do search in a program in the local machine, with the following conditions:<p>1a. the query runs against two data sets, Table1 and Table2.<p>1b. Table1 has one type of data, e.g. Food.  Table2 has another type of data, e.g. Drink.<p>1c. the query has two parameters: param1, param2.  E.g. FoodEaten and DrinkConsumed<p>1d. parse the query to use Param1 against Table1, and to use Param2 against Table2.  E.g.  select * from Food where food_type=:FoodEaten union select * from Drink where drink_type=:DrinkConsumed<p>1e. the query result should based on the parsing of the query and the mapping of parameters to the tables.  The result should relate to the parameters in the query.<p>1f. the whole procedure is run by a process in a computer.<p>See, it&#x27;s not too bad once you break it down.  The claim conditions are kind of BS individually.  The basic idea of the patenting process is to string together a number of day-to-day common items and make the whole thing as patentable.<p>To defeat claim 1, just make one of the conditions false.  The easiest is to attack 1c, which uses the phrase &quot;comprises a first token and a second token,&quot; which means the query contains exactly two tokens as parameters.  Just add a dummy parameter to all 2-parameter query to fail that condition.<p>Attacking 1a with more than 2 tables query also works.<p>Also breaking a 2-table query into two separate queries works, too.<p>Since claim 1 is gone, all other dependent claims are irrelevant.<p>Disclaimer: the above are purely for educational purpose only and are not considered as legal advice.

7902731,comment,7902150,7902150,13,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"I was thinking about the sorts of fraud categories AirBnB likely experiences.  Most fraudsters want cash or cash equivalents, and the use of lodging on a particular night is nearly as illiquid as stolen fine art.  So, those seeking stuff to resell will choose to defraud one of the zillion online marketers who ship stuff to doorsteps.  A buyer who actually used the space he reserved could initiate a chargeback later claiming that the service promised via AirBnB wasn&#x27;t provided -- couldn&#x27;t access apartment, wasn&#x27;t as described, etc.  However, space providers likely will cooperate with AirBnB and provide evidence in their defense.  Better to attempt a chargeback elsewhere if one is short on money.  It seems that using AirBnB as a platform for crimes between buyer and space provider is possible, and there certainly has been at least one heavily publicized case, but we would hear a lot more about these events if they were happening much.<p>So, what&#x27;s left?  Collusion between buyer and space provider -- in all likelihood, they are one in the same, or identities have been stolen.  For example, I list my condo on AirBnB for $100/night.  Someone books it for the weekend, and then doesn&#x27;t show up.  AirBnB owes me $200 -- after all, I gave up other options to profit from its use.  An honest buyer pays up.  But, maybe the buyer is dishonest -- he used a stolen credit card, etc.  In this case, AirBnB eats the loss and pays me as the space provider.  Now, wouldn&#x27;t it be convenient if I was also the buyer?  Cash from stolen credit cards, funneled through AirBnB (much akin to the way online poker sites were used to transfer stolen money via bad heads-up play).  This would work until AirBnB noticed that my listing seems to have a suspicious propensity to attract fraudulent buyers.  Then, they&#x27;ll shut me down.  So, I&#x27;ll pop-up elsewhere.  After all, no need to actually have a space because no one I accept will ever show up!<p>I bet the usage patterns of the party/parties involved in this fraud are drastically different than those of legitimate market participants.  Someone with a fraudulent listing could out himself by rejecting a bunch of legitimate AirBnB buyers, and this behavior would stand-out as it&#x27;s the opposite of the behavior expected of an honest seller.  So, he must protect against this risk by making his listing unappealing (high price, bad photos/description, unpopular location, etc.).  The behavior of users browsing AirBnB when viewing this property could identify its relative undesirability (few clicks, etc.), and price outliers could be identified by comparing similar offerings by date/location/type.  The click stream of the &quot;buyer&quot; likely is most revealing.  Someone selecting an unappealing property without doing much comparison shopping likely isn&#x27;t a legit buyer.<p>What other stuff might predict fraud?  Vague descriptions might indicate a fraudulent listing.  Most space providers love to tell buyers what&#x27;s special about their offering.  Could some scoring of a listing&#x27;s prose prove a strong predictor?  I&#x27;ve never listed with AirBnB.  What do they do to verify listings?  As a buyer, they verified my identity.  Could this serve multiple purposes?  Certainly, I&#x27;d feel better listing my guest room if I know that AirBnB will know the identity of the guy who rented the room and then stabbed me at 3AM.  But, in addition, does identifying market participants in strong ways help keep fraudsters from repeating their crimes by setting up multiple accounts?  Obviously, newer market participants are more risky than established ones, especially those who have interacted with known legit, long-time users.  The social graph comes to the rescue here.   Even astroturfing ought to show up as a small, disconnected graph unless legit users&#x27; identities are stolen.<p>Of course, this comment is all just conjecture.

Sure, some things could be more streamlined (i.e. the transition from Diamond to Active HDL for simulation) but it&#x27;s free and gets the job done.<p>I find a lot of the design resources (Reference designs, user guides, tool chain, etc.) for Xilinx very ambiguous and confusing. Not to mention that certain devices aren&#x27;t covered by the free ISE WebPack and require a paid license to design around some of their FPGAs. I never understood this. I think, like Altium, they do this just because they can and because people using higher end FPGAs tend to have bigger design budgets and..well...they can get away with charging for the design tools.<p>Lattice has positioned itself to be an IoT FPGA company whereas Xilinx seems to keep developing FPGAs that have incredible computing power / bandwidth / logic capacity / etc. I think the complexity of the toolchain scales with at least the square of the capability of the FPGA.<p>If you are looking for a super-capable starter FPGA/CPLD, take a look at the Lattice MachXO2.

They often work in conjunction with a psychiatrist, who is a medical doctor who can give you prescriptions. Most people, or I think most, do both -- drugs and talk therapy combined I think have proven to be the most effective through clinical studies.<p>I did not want to take any drugs though. That has to do partially with my own family&#x27;s history of addiction but also the uncertainty in the science around the drugs. SSRIs are particularly scary to me. My Dad is a research psychologist (he has a PhD in psychology but is not a clinician) and I was very scared of those drugs, how hard they are to get off, etc. I choose to to intensive talk therapy without the drugs, which is very hard, I think, but worked for me. The human brain is very complicated and questions about the long-term effects are mostly unanswered. I didn&#x27;t want to be taking an anti-depressant for the rest of my life.<p>As for how to find a psychologist, I always tell friends that they should go shopping.

I am not sure if it&#x27;s legally required or not but the hotel that is walking you will usually set you up in a nearby hotel and pay for the first night.  Of course if the nearest hotel with an opening is 20 miles away, this could be quite frustrating.<p>Edit: If you are going to be arriving late, call the hotel in advance and let them know and you greatly decrease the likelihood of getting walked as they will tend to walk someone before you instead.",1402974389

Most storyboarding artists get their start as animators themselves, so they know the &quot;form and the material and process,&quot; so to speak. But when they do storyboarding work, they need to work in an agile and rapid fashion, to consider a user&#x27;s flow through the &quot;application&quot; at such a high level that they would be hindered by trying to draw every single detail. Should they know innately what is and is not feasible to animate? Absolutely! But this does not mean that they should use the same tools and techniques as animators to perform their work.<p>Responsive may be difficult to capture in static comps, but when these comps can be made much more quickly, attention can be given to user experience overall, not just isolated fragments of user interface. And it&#x27;s difficult to deny Apple&#x27;s success at driving conversions and purchases.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storyboard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storyboard</a>",1402974349

Specifically it was a bug in the &quot;Heartbeat Extension for the Transport Layer Security&quot; protocol (the HTTPS level is the TLS layer, the underlying encryption functions did not have this particular bug).<p>All that is a technicality, software has bugs.  Heartbleed was a particularly bad security bug.  This doesn&#x27;t mean you throw out the baby with the bath water.  As a society we all use HTTPS and it had a bug -> so we fix this bug and move on as best as we can.<p>As far as I know, something like 99 percent of routers and OS systems such as Linux, Macintosh, and Windows use the OpenSSL library and it has very little to do with Heartbleed.  On the other hand, it is fairly important your system vendor stays on top of security patches and applies them.<p>OpenSSL is software, and therefore has bugs.  But the OpenSSL encryption layer did not contain the Heartbleed bug.  Or put differently, the OpenSSL encryption libraries that encrypt AES 128 and AES 256 had nothing to do with Heartbleed, and those are the parts we continue to use at our company completely for free, without paying any royalties to anybody, and they are a lot more secure than anything we could have hand-rolled ourselves even if we took years to do it.",1402974099

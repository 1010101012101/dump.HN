866059,comment,865918,865918,0,0,jrockway,,,"I'm mostly commenting on this article's linked article, but...<p>Prefork is great if you have about two or three concurrent connections, and if you aren't using a dynamic language like Perl, Python, or Ruby.  Otherwise, lightweight threads will serve you better.<p>One problem that people have (had?) with persistent preforked mod_perl apps is that copy-on-write also copies on reads for certain Perl structures.  Say you have ""my $foo = 42"" and then you fork.  The Sv associated with $foo is shared.  But when the child says ""if($foo eq ...)"", the Sv is no longer the same; it's changed from an SvIV to a SvPVIV.  No more sharing.  (Maybe Python and Ruby are more clever here, but they pay a speed price on non-forked applications for this.)<p>Eventually you end up with two completely different memory images for the same app instead of the 1 copy of the parent shared with the child.<p>As for the ""about two or three concurrent connections"" part, I think you will find that ""select"" exists for a reason.  (""select"" is just as much a part of UNIX as ""fork"", BTW.)  If you have a bunch of mostly idle filehandles to read from, select (or rather, its modern replacements) will perform much better than a bunch of forked processes.  Imagine you are writing a push messaging server; do you really want one process for each of your 1 million users?  No; you want a lightweight thread for each.<p>(Try this sometime; create 1,000,000 lightweight threads.  Then create 1,000,000 processes that do nothing.  Then note which one requires you to reboot your computer by yanking the power cable.)",1254890258

When they are segregated, this causes many accidents without a new traffic signal pattern.)<p><i>2 through 4</i><p>Agree.<p><i>5. Abandon helmet laws and stop talking about 'safety'. The most reliable way to reduce the number of injuries is to increase the number of cyclists, and mandating helmets/kvetching about safety creates a false perception that cycling is more dangerous than driving (it's not).</i><p>Helmets are not for protecting yourself from cars, they are about protecting yourself from yourself.  I have gone down hard on my head a few times, and that's no fault of any other vehicle (only poorly maintained roads).  The helmet has been very helpful for that.  (It also keeps my hair out of my eyes.  Doubleplus good.)<p>In the end, the problem is that most cyclists drive unsafely and that they are not aware of the risks.  (Or what ""driving safely"" even is.  They just guess... and get it wrong, and never think to maybe read a book about riding safely.)<p>(Many inexperienced cyclists are afraid of being hit from behind, so they ride too close to the parked cars on the right.  Then some idiot opens their door into them, and they end up in the hospital.  This is much more common than being hit by behind.  Similarly, cyclists afraid of the street ride on the sidewalk, and then they get hit by a right-turning car.  This is one of the most common type of bicycle accident.)<p>Anyway, we really need to make people aware of these issues, and we need to significantly reduce the speed limit on urban roads.  (Most people seem to drive about 35-40 near downtown Chicago before it gets too traffic-y.  The speed limit should be no greater than 25; then bikes and cars are almost at the same speed.  With the timing of traffic lights, the overall speed isn't much higher than this, anyway.  If 25mph is too slow for you, park your car and take (grade-separated) rapid transit!)<p>My prediction is that this never happens, as recent legislation has been aimed at reducing the rights of cyclists.

I've cracked several master locks in my life, and I found one for which the above method did not work--I kept getting the wrong 3rd digit, no matter how carefully I looked for the .5's.  (Trying several hundred combinations in the process.)  I recall another occasion when I gave up after finding two wrong 3rd digits (and trying 200 combinations), and another when my friend told me that the 3rd digit I found was wrong.  With Google, I found this method, and it seems to work perfectly:
<a href=""http://www.angelfire.com/ma4/masterlockcrack/3rd-2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.angelfire.com/ma4/masterlockcrack/3rd-2.html</a><p>It gives the same answers as the first method <i>most</i> of the time.

The numbers I recall are less than 2 times speedup.  Which I think I heard in an interview of Joe Armstrong on Software Engineering Radio, but I am not sure.  Or perhaps it was an presentation by Guy Steele on parallel algorithms.  Joe's message was that parallelism needs to be explicit.  One of Guy's was that you need to use different algorithms allow parallel rather than serial processing.<p>I think we agree, that we expect to get more than (2 * one core speed) on our 10,000 core CPUs of the future.",1254888631

The iPhone app is basic, but extremely helpful as far as what it does.<p>There are some Mac-specific answers in the knowledge-base and the forums, but really I mostly interact with RingCentral via a browser (not a problem on Safari or Firefox), the iPhone app or the VOIP handset itself.<p>If you have specific questions, I would be happy to see if I can do whatever you're concerned you'll not be able to do and let you know.<p>edit: I don't really use the SoftPhone or fax from within applications. Some of the finer details of this stuff may end up being PC-only.",1254888267

So if you only want to sell, say, 5 - 8 job ads a month at a fair price, DIY might be the way to go.<p>If, however, you want to ramp up the number of jobs shown and the overall revenue (as opposed to price per ad), then a 3rd party job board which also provides some job ads may be the way to go.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.inc.com/magazine/20090101/how-hard-could-it-be-thanks-or-no-thanks_Printer_Friendly.html?partner=fogcreek"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inc.com/magazine/20090101/how-hard-could-it-be-th...</a>",1254888217

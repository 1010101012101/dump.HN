I haven't really checked, but you have to populate and invalidate memcached explicitly, and it doesn't honor database isolation (if you invalidate cache after writing an object, some instances may read stale data after you already updated the db, etc). MongoDB's cache may cut corners in a similar way, I'd love to know.",1288079886

I can't remember the link, but I read a while back about a researcher who discovered that the optimum way to memorize using flash cards is if a learner who answers incorrectly is shown the correct answer and then asked again after a number of other questions just at the point where the correction is on the threshold of slipping out of his short term memory. This length of time has to be optimized for each learner by some sort of adaptive algorithm. Have you considered doing anything like that, or do you already?",1288079676
1833423,comment,1831838,1832163,0,0,wkornewald,,,"Not sure if this is important for you to know, but anyway: I'm one of the creators of Django-nonrel (a fork of Django which adds support for NoSQL DBs to the ORM), I've helped with the development of the MongoDB backend, I've developed a large part of the App Engine backend, and I've worked for over two years with NoSQL solutions.<p>As you've said, scalability is one valid reason for using a NoSQL solution. Sometimes you also have special needs for multi-datacenter replication or whatever. Sometimes a NoSQL DB can fit your problem better than a SQL DB. However, what does it look like from a development standpoint?<p>If you have an offline-capable app it might be easier to implement it with CouchDB.<p>Also, CouchDB's MapReduce views could allow you to run queries that wouldn't be possible with SQL. Note that MongoDB also has MapReduce support, but it rebuilds the whole index instead of only the parts that changed, so on a large DB this might take too long and thus be impractical. Anyway, I guess you're talking about NoSQL solutions in general.<p>In some cases you actually want to store very flexible schemaless data in your DB. SQL would be a huge pain, here.<p>It might also be easier to switch from an XML DB to e.g. MongoDB.<p>Migrations can sometimes also be easier with a schemaless DB. This could be important when experimenting or developing iteratively.<p>Anyway, most of these are all rather special use-cases and that's probably the important development-side strength of NoSQL: Having solutions for special problems.<p>Some people here say that working with NoSQL is more natural than with SQL. If you're comparing hand-written SQL code with hand-written code for the low-level MongoDB API then that's indeed true. However, in practice you should better use an ORM because that makes you more effective. When comparing, for example, the Django ORM with MongoEngine you'll see that the APIs look similar. It's just that SQL gives you infinitely more powerful queries and an ORM makes writing even complex queries very easy. A NoSQL DB sometimes forces you to jump through hoops to implement something that would be a two-liner in SQL+ORM. So, from this point of view NoSQL has nothing to offer for a large number of problems. Of course, some projects only use very simple queries which map nicely to NoSQL. In these cases it doesn't make any real difference whether you use SQL or NoSQL, but that still is not a real plus for NoSQL.<p>One other reason that once spoke for NoSQL: Google App Engine and Amazon SimpleDB were among the first solutions which offered scalable, replicated, managed hosting with an acceptably cheap pay-as-you-go model. Today we have Amazon RDS, MS SQL Azure, and soon App Engine will have SQL hosting, too, and there are several other cheap cloud hosts with SQL support. So, this reason isn't valid, anymore. It might still be part of the hype, though.<p>Yes, NoSQL is indeed over-hyped. Too many newbies use it for the wrong reasons (esp. on App Engine where they use it because they can save $3/month). Only if you need to scale or if your project has special needs you might find rescue in the NoSQL world.<p>Finally, since many of us are working on a web startup: As long as it's not clear if you'll become successful and thus have to scale you might be tempted to use SQL and develop faster in the early phase of your project. However, when looking at a complete web project the development/code overhead caused by NoSQL (vs SQL) is often not very large (well, depending on your particular project), so you might want to go with NoSQL right from the start and not have scalability woes later on. Anyway, you need to make an informed decision for your particular problem. Don't just pick NoSQL because it's hyped and also don't just pick SQL because you're wary of hype. :)<p>BTW, if you want to go with NoSQL and still have more complex queries like with SQL you should join our open-source project django-dbindexer. The goal is to automate denormalization and index generation such that you can use e.g. simple JOINs and aggregates with Django's ORM instead of emulating them with hand-written code. This should be useful to a lot of web startups and make it easier to use NoSQL instead of SQL right from the start and not worry about scalability.

I'm very interested in law (as you can probably tell) and the more I study the more I feel that clarity predicts quality. If anyone in the Bay Area or beyond wants to have recurring discussions about interesting research avenues I'd be delighted.<p>Right now most vendors compete on volume processing and retrieval speed, which are very important - deadlines in this field are not targets, but legal obligations, and inaccuracy or failure to perform is a quick path to ruin. But I have a growing wishlist of less obviously commercial things that should exist already but don't. I'm more interested in studying law than researching what's hot in semantic modeling, text parsers and so on...but thee's a ton of interesting possibilities and vast public domain datasets.",1288077538

1833367,comment,1832063,1833188,0,0,alsomike,,,"I think you're missing that the very fact that you had to wonder if you were running afoul of the honor code is what makes people compliant. The Harvey Mudd honor code specifies ""integrity"" - but what does this mean? When there aren't clear definitions, people start to imitate others, especially those who are assumed to know what the rules really are. The punishment for violations doesn't even need to be explicit, the threat of being ostracized or losing face is a strong enough disincentive for many people. The fact that you internalized the values of the community means you perceived them as just, so for you, the self-policed rules were legitimate. And maybe they were legitimate. But here's a big problem: the administration is not operating transparently, they are counting on social behavior to control students according to a hidden set of rules that aren't up for discussion or debate, unlike an explicit rule book that could be questioned and contested.<p>The problem with the disciplinary board follows the same logic: just as vague, open-ended rules create more compliant behavior, you should expect that a student-run disciplinary board will also penalize deviant behavior much more enthusiastic precisely because the administration is hands-off.<p>The important question is whether the (explicit or implicit) rules are good rules, not whether you're permitted to self-police them. Self-policing may be more efficient, but the cost is less transparency and more conservative behavior.",1288077173

Please don't <i>encourage</i> it.<p>Once upon a time, people's ""data shadows"" were very thin indeed. In <i>The Fatal Shore</i>, a truly awesome history book about Australia, they talked about policing in Georgian England. The identification of criminals relied primarily on verbal descriptions of their looks:<p><i>Official crime records and registers of criminals were primitive, and there would be no fingerprinting until 1885. Artists made sketches, for popular consumption, of famous offenders... but one could no more recognize a felon from such semi-devotional effigies than pick St. Paul from a crowd by consulting a Byzantine icon. Identification of wanted men had to be made from verbal descriptions in the police gazettes, circulated to mayors and magistrates after the early 1770s... Sketchy as they were, such descriptions did produce some arrests, mainly in villages where people noticed strangers. Some officers of the law had long memories. Henry Fielding's sightless half-brother John, a magistrate known in Bow Street as the ""Blind Beak,"" was said to be able to identify 3000 different malefactors by their voices alone. But on the whole, it was easier for criminals to escape scot-free in the 1780s than it would ever be again.</i><p>This meant that, once you had caught a suspected criminal, there was no way to release them temporarily without them disappearing, quite possibly forever. So a lot of crimes were punishable by fines (which could be collected on the spot), or by immediate imprisonment (which is what you got if you couldn't pay the fine), or by death. You couldn't really put people on probation, or parole, or release them on bail.<p>The result, in practice, was that every person who stole a loaf of bread risked indefinite imprisonment or even death. It was so inhumane (and so expensive -- there weren't enough jails) that the English legal system leapt at the opportunity to solve the problem in a novel way: Transport criminals to the colonies, where they would never bother homelanders again even when they were freed. Until 1776 the favorite colonial destination was the American colonies, but after that the English had to invent the Australian penal colonies...",1220538903

I may tell threads to go to sleep, wait for another thread to finish something, or prefer a certain thread to run over others.<p>Yes, they are still scheduled by the OS kernel, but they are also being controlled by my own scheduling algorithms. I call this scheduling, because it's the same problem as OS level scheduling. And if I have to do it, I imagine Chrome has to do it. In this scenario, if you want to understand the runtime behavior of the threads, you must consider both OS kernel level decisions and my scheduling decisions.<p>I would also be surprised if there was no Chrome memory management inbetween malloc and the OS kernel.",1220538735

People screw up.  I'm a big fan of forgiveness.

Yes, identity (can) protect you from the state as much as it protects the state from you.  Without identity, the government could (conceivably) steal you away in the night.  With identity, that becomes harder as your relatives have documents proving your existence.<p>Those are just a few cases.  To address your issues: your name must be on your passport because while your home country may perceive you as no threat, another country might perceive you as a risk.  Usually that's simply an issue of politics, but let's say that it's 2008 and you're an upstanding citizen so you just grab yourself a shiny new passport; 2009 comes and you rob a dozen banks; it's in the state's interest to be able to differentiate between your passport and the passports of others at all times and not simply make the ok/not ok determination at issuance.  With driver's licenses, an SSN requirement prevents someone who lost their license due to several counts of drunk driving from simply applying for a new one under a new name - drunk drivers can pass the exam, but they still aren't people I'd like on the road.<p>For better or worse, we're becoming a dossier society.  On the better side, people who shouldn't be able to escape their past have a harder time (drunk drivers can't just go to the RMV and pass a test).  On the worse side, people can't escape their past even when it's not that important - and I would say that a lot of people create a lot of anxiety over the fact that they have such a dossier following them around.",1220537112

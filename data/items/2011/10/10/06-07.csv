Does dpkg(1), as opposed to rpm(8), really make all the difference in ""ease-of-use""?<p>Of course, I understand what you mean, however, don't you think that if Debian really blew RHEL and SLES out of the water, its adoption in the enterprise server space would be a bit higher? You are kidding yourself if you pretend that the commercial distros are only used because they come with support, and also need support, being intentionally crippled.<p>Obviously, a meaningful comparison of Debian, RHEL and SLES does not fit into a HN comment, but as someone who has used all three, I would always choose Debian last, and not only because of the lack of commercial support.<p>(By the way, the main point of the support you get for RHEL and SLES is not access to a guy on the phone. The real value is the L3 support, i.e. bugfixing. As a Debian user who runs into a bug that cripples your system, your options are:<p>a) fix it yourself<p>b) pray to $DEITY that Debian developers fix it soon<p>c) try to expedite b) by harassing Debian developers in bugzilla, which is going to be as inefficient as you'd expect.<p>As a paying customer of Red Hat or SuSE, you are entitled to and will receive a fix for the bug ASAP, and although ASAP often translates to ""a couple of weeks"", it is still a hell of a lot better than what Debian can offer.)",1318228887

It is indeed hard for her and she doesn't really grok it, but she can do it nonetheless after a short course she took in college.<p>Another example - a client of mine wanted a simple CMS. I cropped up something quickly in Django - it had a WYSIWYG editor. The person writing articles would copy/paste articles from MS Word; needless to say the copy/pasted articles looked like crap and even though the editor itself did a pretty good job, it was a futile job trying to correct the formatting afterwards. The fix for that was disabling the WYSIWYG editor altogether and replacing it with a Markdown-enabled plain text-box. So she could no longer copy/paste anything other than plain text; and it was painful watching the transition, but it was OK in the end.<p>Sometimes the right answer for the shitty status quo we are in is better education not more shitty tools. There are good reasons for why web developers absolutely hate WYSIWYG tools for writing HTML, you know.<p>Also, if you treat your users like idiots, they will be idiots.<p><pre><code>     Eventually Muse might even created better HTML \n     than a hand coder\n</code></pre>\nNo, it doesn't and it never will, mostly because of HTML's design.",1318228298

3092490,comment,3090868,3091741,8,0,jholman,,,"Don't get me wrong, I think the project is a neat one.  I like the features, I like the goal, and honestly I just like new-language projects in general.  So please don't think I'm hating on the project.<p>But your argument for the name is so utterly broken.<p>First of all, having a PhD in CS and introducing 3 security holes is no reason to blame the language.  It's not even necessarily a reason to blame yourself.  Since when is a PhD in CS supposed to make you a good software engineer?  If it is, I know a lot of PhDs who got a raw deal.<p>Second, how does your language fix the three security bugs you introduced?  The only security feature I see in your highlights list is ""secure by default: no eval, no magic quotes/string interpolation"".  99 out of 100 competent PHP programmers force magic quotes off (so if your brother didn't, he can shut up), and most bugs that can be introduced with string interpolation can be (and usually are) introduced with string concatenation (which I assume you can still do).<p>Third, the main thing you demonstrated with this story (as others have said) is that you aren't very good with PHP.  That's no big shame, but it's also not a reason you ""own the right to call this language PHP.reboot"".  This reasoning is crazyface.<p>Fourth, as others have said, calling it ""PHP.reboot"" just confines it to the ghetto.  If it were to grow, people wouldn't be able to search for articles/blogs/forums/help/mail/etc about it without getting lost in the PHP (even admitting that for me googling ""php reboot"" does return your google-code repo).  And right in the name it says ""I'm the wanna-be little brother of the big successful language"".  Although I don't think this last criticism is a problem, because I assume the goal was not to actually replace PHP, because that's impossible for reasons others have mentioned.

Also it isn't really intended to be a one-stop source for everything, feel free to create a better one and ask us to migrate though. :)",1183237096

Sounds like we're talking about the same source. Unfortunately, its no longer in print so therefore very very hard to find..<p>I'll shoot you an email if I find more.. My co-founder knows more about this stuff than me I'll ask him.",1183235400

The only scientific study seemed to be from sleep researcher Claudio Stampi and his essentially said ""If you <i>absolutely can't</i> keep regular sleeping schedules (like in long sailing races) then polyphasic sleep is a better alternative"".  <p>If you have pointers to papers I'd appreciate links sent to     the email-id in my profile.  I might try this again someday.  \n",1183234958

31766,comment,31694,31765,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"Agree with everything you said (especially the difficulty socializing part).<p>My solution to most of the problem is to ""ease"" into the schedule. Keep a core sleep period of like 4-5 hrs at night but continue to take your naps. As you acclimatize, try shrinking/eliminating the core sleep gradually. That way you dont feel like you're getting hit by a train like you do if you try and jump right into it.<p>As far as code quality, I find mine is actually much better.. The period just after each nap I feel really refreshed and can concentrate. Theres actually research out there that proves this is true. Again, I think its all about avoiding a rough acclimation period though..",1183234283

And since my money is already there, I pay my bills and expenses from it.<p>I fully expect my bank to narc on me to the feds at every turn, and screw me hard if I ever have a real problem with them.  I expect them to nickel-and-dime me with fees.  I expect them to introduce seemingly arbitrary delays and paperwork requirements for their own convenience.  I expect them to offer rates on deposits that cannot keep up with inflation and charge rates on loans and credit that would make even the serenest of divine avatars flip tables.  And if the turds ever hit the turbines, I expect that making a trip to the nearest bank branch office would be the least useful thing I could possibly do.<p>I don&#x27;t really have a lot of confidence in Bitcoin, but the bar they need to pass with respect to trust is ridiculously low--set there by the banking system.  Where they fail is definitely convenience.<p>If my employer offered to make payroll in Bitcoin, and if my local utilities, gas stations, and grocery stores accepted payment in Bitcoin, I would be using it already.<p>But all those places prefer to trust human bankers rather than crypto algorithms running in a distributed computing network.  I don&#x27;t see that changing any time soon.  If anything, an alt-currency backed by an alliance of megaretailers like Walmart, Target, and Amazon would have to crack that nut first.

However it seems that for a contract position I cannot even get an interview and I think it&#x27;s understandable: if you have to choose between two developers for a 3 months contract and both have a strong CV but one of the two has some examples of work to prove his skills/experience, I&#x27;d personally choose the one with the examples (assuming that they&#x27;re good) instead of hiring/interviewing the other just basing myself on trust.

I&#x27;ve seen solid technologies that ultimately died due to regulatory requirements.<p>The real argument here isn&#x27;t over the network, but the services that sit on that network and who owns them. Network owners have been pushing to own both the network and the services, just like they owned wireline and POTS dialtone.<p>Networks saw the internet companies rise up on their networks, rival and ultimately dwarf them.

But compared to practically any other discipline, programming is extremely accessible. It only requires a computer, internet access, and time. 85% of the US population has internet access, and (as Sam Altman later says[1]) libraries are available for the less fortunate. Compare that to biology. Or chemistry. Or mechanical engineering. Or becoming a plumber. If you are poor, all of these are harder to learn than coding.<p>Maurice&#x27;s story is inspiring, but his bulleted list isn&#x27;t the only way to become a programmer. Mentors are helpful, but they&#x27;re certainly not required to learn programming. Ditto for entrepreneurship programs or hacker bootcamps or college education. The only really necessary things are (again) a computer, internet access, and time. Everything else is for widening the funnel. Beneficial? Yes. Worth funding more? Certainly. But not required.<p>Really, I think the post misses Altman&#x27;s point. If you read the whole discussion stemming from the original tweet, it&#x27;s pretty clear that he: 1. Is talking about this in the context of increasing immigration. And 2. Is in favor of more aid for domestic coding education.<p>In short: They agree vehemently, but Altman&#x27;s just being honest about the relative difficulty of learning to code.<p>1. <a href=""https://twitter.com/sama/status/549746694900813825"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/sama/status/549746694900813825</a>",1425058708

My GitHub account is not very solid from this perspective either.<p>So I&#x27;m in the process of creating a portfolio to showcase four of the best and most recent/relevant projects I&#x27;ve built, with the objective to use the portfolio itself to showcase my skills: I&#x27;ll then be able to use it as an example of code I&#x27;m proud of (or by looking at the source or by publishing it on GitHub).<p>Do you thinks it&#x27;s a viable solution?

They don&#x27;t need more money, right?<p>I have a case now where I am trying to buy a name for a client that will pay $500,000 USD for it plus stock options. And the corporation that owns the name (not google but a company in the UK) has no interest at all in parting with the name at even those price levels. Part of the reason is that the people in corporate jobs don&#x27;t personally stand to gain by selling the domain the money doesn&#x27;t go into their pocket. So they aren&#x27;t motivated by economic benefits at all which makes it particularly difficult to get deals like that done (although there are other ways for sure).",1425058418

Large concurrent and distributed applications benefit a bit less from static typing in traditional languages. Or rather, they are so hard, that type error are not as much of a significance. How concurrency, communication and failure is handled is more critical.<p>But say a game or a large desktop application with millions of lines of code, could get a larger benefit from static type checking, no doubt.<p>Now for a bit of personal experience. I have programmed in Java, C#, Python, Erlang, C++. I have found that when working with large or unknown code bases C# for example is great. Just having the IDE and generics support in C# during compile time is awesome. But if I program something from scratch, I can make a lot faster progress in Python. I often put more work into both unit tests and integration tests because I just have more time available.<p>Also failures during run-time, even in Python, in my systems a very rarely type errors (those are caught pretty early one).

9120031,comment,9097404,9103668,0,0,RayDonnelly,,,"Thanks, sure, POSIX is a round hole and Windows a square peg, but I think that the excellent work done by Cygwin over the last few years has done a great deal to file down the edges of the Windows peg. MSYS2&#x27;s hacks on top usually function ok.<p>With Git, I can clone very large projects almost as quickly with MSYS2 as I can ArchLinux. We did begin to port msysGit (the native, non-MSYS executable, yeah, go figure) to MSYS2 and found very little speed improvement so stopped since the msys2 version is much more functional and always up-to-date.<p>Using Autotools on MSYS2 isn&#x27;t significantly slower than on GNU/Linux. You can try building any of the many Autotools based projects we provide to see this for yourself. Besides, for software which relies on Autotools for it&#x27;s build system, there&#x27;s no choice but to use it (outside of cross compilation).<p>That NTFS (and the Windows filesystem layer) isn&#x27;t fast is independent of MSYS2 vs native Windows anyway.<p>An anti-virus will slow down all Windows tasks to an unusable crawl, just run your scan overnight and take care about what you click on. MSYS2 isn&#x27;t hit worse than, say Visual Studio. Fundamentally MSYS2 is software distribution who&#x27;s end product is native Windows applications aimed at the user. The POSIX stuff exists just helps us get there (this is why we don&#x27;t provide X Windows; if you want that, use Cygwin), so for example using Qt Creator as supplied by MSYS2 should give an experience that&#x27;s roughly the same as using Qt Creator supplied by the Qt Project (but much easier to maintain).<p>Apart from for installing and updating packages, you can avoid the MSYS2 console and just run programs in C:\msys64\mingw64\bin.<p>The security advantages we bring via shared packages (e.g. libraries) are very worthwhile.<p>> Trying to deal with SSH through bash and msys is not a user friendly experience. PuTTY is the gold standard of SSH clients on Windows.<p>Since on MSYS2, things are shared, your SSH keys are shared between all applications that use them in ~/.ssh, as you&#x27;d expect. I use mklink /D to unify my Windows User folder and my MSYS2 HOME folders (be careful not to use our un-installer if you do this though, if follows the symlink :-(). We do have putty but I haven&#x27;t checked that it doesn&#x27;t use %AppData% or worse, the Windows registry to store keys. If it does that&#x27;s a bug we&#x27;ll fix. To install putty:<p>$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-putty",1425057951

As you will be able to tell, this is still rough and not polished (more or less a prototype).<p>http://thorly.batr.am/<p>There are many commonly used flash files that are known to be vulnerable and are used all over the place regardless.
Thorly aims to give you some idea about which files to avoid.<p>Simply input a URL or upload a flash file and it will check for common security problems (for example XSS). 
At the moment the user only gets information about whether the file is assumed to be vulnerable.<p>This will only be a short test run and I will probably take it down after a few hours (to scared to let it run on its own).",1425056469

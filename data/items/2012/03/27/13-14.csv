The way that a ""good"" practice can become ""bad"" (and vice versa) depending on the working context can be very hard to figure out.<p>Testing would be another one that would come into play here (and I guess that it's interesting that it didn't even <i>occur</i> to me to mention it since having a good automated test suite is so much of the way that I work now).<p>Without a good test suite having collective code ownership becomes <i>much</i> harder because making some dumb mistake that breaks something unintentionally becomes much harder to spot.",1332856789

Canada understands energy; China understands energy; Japan understands energy. We can't even build a simple pipeline - until the next week, when Obama goes from claiming he's a protector of the environment, to bragging he has built enough pipeline to circle the world.

It will not be your typical frame-frame-punchline comics, more like infographic-style drawings and doodles about problems, irony and other adventures I run into in my life. Let's say really colourful personal stories. That's one way of putting it.<p>But I don't want to make a comic site that 520372947 people have already made. You know that kind comic site you've already seen a dozen of times. I want to bring things up a notch and make something that people actually want to read and see. To do something different. That's why I wanted to turn to you and ask for ideas.<p>My ""how-to-make-awesome-comic-site-like-no-other"" ideas so far:<p>- Make animations. People are vlogging with a video camera, but no one is doing that with animations. Again, I would not do Pixar-quality animations, more like rage comics meets South Park meets Powerpoint. Very DIY, amateurish you could say but highly personal.<p>- Make comics with HTML animations, with tools like Hype or something else and keep the infographic style. SEO-wise this would be a suicide, because javascript doesn't offer much flexibility with SEO, but: it's the content that matters, not search engine optimization.<p>- Provide a new comic and a new video every single day. Most webcomics do new stuff a couple of times per week. By putting drawings out everyday, I would stand out from the majority and that schedule would keep me drawings and creating every single day. This would be very time-consuming, but I don't mind that.<p>- Mix and match infographic layout-style with the personal comics and doodles. I really like infographics, but I don't want collect data and publish one about how many people are jackasses on the workplace on average. I'll rather be inspired by infographics and use that inspiration to put out, hopefully something unique.<p>Any thoughts? I'd be really thankful for any ideas or thoughts. Any thoughts. Seriously guys, I'm desperate.<p>Seriously.",1332855182

It could have just been the timing of when I read it.   Tim Ferriss told me the book that changed the way he saw the world was Maximum Achievement by Brian Tracy, but when I read it, it seemed like conventional wisdom.  So maybe it's just timing.<p>What I liked about Tony Robbins' message was this:<p>* - Change happens in an instant.  People act like change takes years, but really it's almost always a key moment, an instant where you change the way you think about something, or make a promise to yourself to change the way you act (even though it feels strange at first). It may have taken years of procrastination to get to that pain point, but the change itself is instant.<p>* - You can change the way you think, so you can change the way you feel.  People say, ""I can't help the way I feel."" or ""This is just who I am.""  But you were an almost-blank slate when born, and most of what you think was just taught into you by someone, so you can un-do it, and replace it with any beliefs or even emotions that support your goal.  He gives a great example of funerals in New Orleans: how they play sad music for a few minutes, then break into celebration. We think that death is universally sad, right? But this shows there's another way to think about it.  So you can choose to feel happy about each person that rejects you (""one step closer!""), or choose to feel disgusted by the thought of procrastinating (""it's my mortal enemy!""), or whatever you choose to feel.<p>Actually there were probably 100 other things like this that changed the way I think, but just seem commonplace to me now because I've been thinking them so long.<p>Grab any of those classic self-help books like ""Think and Grow Rich"" or ""Maximum Achievement"" or ""Awaken the Giant Within"".  When read at the right time in your life, it can really change everything.<p>(( Oh, just noticed you asked about harmony.  All the stuff he taught be was very basic jazz harmony that almost any book on the subject will teach.  The key was how fast he taught it. ))",1332854630

CD47 appears to be higher on tumor cells than on normal cells. In general, the higher the expression of a marker on a diseased cell versus a healthy cell, the more of a therapeutic window/index [1] that is available for a treatment to specifically target diseased cells.<p>2. Inhibiting the anti-phagocytosis (i.e., ""don't eat me"") signal is only half of the equation. There are also pro-phagocytosis (i.e., ""eat me"") signal(s) that also are present [2] and that play a role in whether, and how well, macrophages, and other phagocytes, can phagocytose a cell. ""Eat me"" signal(s) also differ between normal and cancer cells, adding more nuance to the situation.<p>[1] Therapeutic index: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_index"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_index</a><p>[2] A paper examining a putative ""eat me"" signal, as it relates to CD47: <a href=""http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/2/63/63ra94.abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/2/63/63ra94.abstract</a>",1332854455

Yes, from the business perspective (or the project management perspective or the agile coach perspective or the countless other professions that have infiltrated software development), this list is absolutely great. Couldn't be better. Five-star perfection.<p>However, from the programmer's point of view - and that is the view I was arguing from - the list is pretty detestable, at least in my view. People get into programming usually because they want to make things, because they want to be creative. But - in the vast majority of cases - they end up working on legacy projects that require absolutely no creativity, where, indeed, creativity is frowned upon - see Commandment 4. You are saying they should shut-up and deal with it. I am saying, fuck that, they can complain as much as they like.<p>Having said that, even better than complaining would be for the programmer to ditch the job and start creating their own software, under their own terms.

Ultimately they are recruiting you because of your skill profile and trying to find the best place for you since in the long run it will benefit them (and hopefully you). So ask your recruiting contact for more info - and when you do so mention what you have found in your research and readings - because it (a) shows your committed and (b) will help them quickly see what are relevant possibilities.<p>The quants i know in finance have varied backgrounds but are predominantly maths, comp.sci and physics backgrounds  and all asked similar questions on entry into their banks and financial institutions.

(edit - there are some who also use .net - but i forgot about them :-)) What tech is used will really depend on the bank. As a quant your job will be to work out how to implement and maintain algorithm, systems and tools around their tech environment - so it is probably better to be open on the language side and look at it all as huge good learning opportunity (which it is) and find a spot where the subject matter is going to intrigue/interest you.

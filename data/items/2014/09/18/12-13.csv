And no-one seems to use Jasmine.\n</code></pre>\nJasmine <i>appears</i> to be unpopular within the JavaScript community but in reality that just accounts for those in the NodeJS and, more recently, the subset of the front-end JS community who use NodeJS tools in their projects.<p>Mocha, the most popular test framework, has been a Node module since late 2011 [0], whereas Jasmine has only been one since mid-2013 [1]. I have a hunch that the majority of Jasmine users aren&#x27;t on-board with the movement of front-end JS and NodeJS ecosystems merging, and since Jasmine [3] doesn&#x27;t really aim itself at NodeJS projects, it&#x27;s far less likely to be used in any project which uses NPM for dependency management.<p>Not really that important, just interesting :)<p>[0]: <a href=""https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha/commits/master/package.json?page=5"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha/commits/master/package....</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/commits/master/package.json"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/commits/master/package.js...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine</a>",1411045103

Maybe I&#x27;m reading a different message from this series than you (but TBH, I gave up after season 3; unfortunately, my favourite plot arc ended with the season 1, and after that, I just couldn&#x27;t see the point of what they were all doing).<p>I&#x27;ll also admit that the &quot;libertarian paradise&quot; was a potshot; it just popped to my mind that the kind of things my more &quot;freedom-oriented&quot; friends say wrt. to policy and gun control would fit perfectly to a zombie apocalypse.

I didn&#x27;t say there were epubs in the kindle store, but that many of their ebooks were converted from epub format [to <i>get them into</i> the kindle store as kf8 or mobi].  To elaborate:  You can&#x27;t natively edit kf8 or mobi files (at least not with mainstream editors).  kf8 and mobi ebooks therefore originate as html or epub (which are pretty much the same thing, ignoring that epubs are zipped, and ignoring simple extras like toc and cover page semantics).  Kindle-supported kf8 format is generated using kindlegen operating on either a epub or html source (or some other formats, which aren&#x27;t recommended because they lack formatting parity with epub/kf8).  The point being, ebooks are basically in some quasi-html open format to begin with, Amazon requires converting them to a proprietary format (and kf8 is a very thin proprietary veneer over epub) to get them onto kindles... a conversion that serves no practical, functional purpose.",1411043606

From 2000-2003 I did IT support for a lab with SLA, FDM, SLS, LOM, and Z-Corp machines (and wrote some supporting software for many of them).<p>In addition to your list:<p><pre><code>    * parts often need some type of post processing to\n      be viable long term (it depends on the process,\n      support removal, sanding/bead blasting, resin\n      injection, curing, etc.) this can take many additional\n      hours.\n    * different machines have different tolerances\n</code></pre>\nThat said, I&#x27;m surprised overhang is an issue. This is a solved problem. Machines like FDM use a non-binding support material; support is intrinsic to SLS, Z-Corp, and LOM processes; SLA is the worst since the support material is the same as the building material. To the best of my memory, in these big commercial machines support creation was done as part of the slicing process (or some other solid model preparation) in software before the part was sent to the machine.<p>That said, this is the first home 3D printer that I&#x27;ve been excited about, and the price point is killer.<p>Also, if they haven&#x27;t licensed tech from 3D Systems, how long before they are sued.",1411043484

There are lots and lots of works hat explore the ethics space. Game theory being newer isn&#x27;t on the classics, but you&#x27;ll find it in modern literature too.<p>> It&#x27;s the Federation that was the hero in Star Trek.<p>Each epoch has the propaganda that suits it.

Science fiction and cyberpunk are <i>really</i> good at speculating about the future (and, of course, by extension, the present: everything is a mirror), because of the setting that they take place in. On the other hand, Romance novels they tend to make good mediators for dealing with different issues, such as sexuality, taboos, class, etc. Just look at Jayne Eyre.",1411042424

EP for example would suggest males would tend to massacre their neighbours and grab their females as this would be a genetic benefit. To study that experimentally you could look at the historic record of conquests and the genetic results, study uncontacted human societies, the stuff ISIS is doing now, chimp studies such as those recently in the news (<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/18/science/lethal-violence-in-chimps-occurs-naturally-study-suggests.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/18/science/lethal-violence-in...</a>)\nand such like. You could also run MRIs on people brains to try to understand the mechanisms and so on. It&#x27;s not college surveys and just so stories.<p>Indeed the fact that ISIS massacring the Yazidi&#x27;s and rounding up women fits the evolutionary chimp style raiding hypothesis better than the loving God hypothesis is significant and might discourage the guys from doing if they realised that. Then maybe the massacres could stop through scientific enlightenment rather than us reluctantly having to go bomb them. Again it&#x27;s more than Cosmo type stuff.",1411042235

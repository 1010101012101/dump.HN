Whenever I read it I&#x27;m constantly amazed that it works as well as it does, given that whenever I peer behind the curtain what&#x27;s going on there is fairly appalling.<p>I remember some years ago the wiki page for Bitcoin insisted it was a ponzi scheme. Wikipedia has a page that defines the essential elements of a ponzi scheme and Bitcoin didn&#x27;t meet them, but no matter - edits to remove this statement were immediately reverted and diverted to an endless discussion page in which the camper in question couldn&#x27;t be persuaded by any means, not logic, not evidence, not weight of people disagreeing. I see that these days the issue has been &quot;resolved&quot; by having an entire section called &quot;ponzi scheme dispute&quot; that consists merely of different pundits contradicting each other.<p>Still, this is better than it used to be.",1446461937

If you have a large contract built on fragile tech with no design and no care, then in order to save the project (from a technical perspective) my experience is that you often have to step on some toes.  Code doesn&#x27;t get that way by accident.  Somebody (very likely <i>everybody</i>) thought that they were doing the right thing.  Explaining that they were wrong is a horrible job (I hope you get paid a lot ;-) ).<p>But if you think back, how many times did people thank you (before the end of the project) for doing what was necessary to get the project back on track?  How many times did you use super human effort to claw a monstrocity from the brink of disaster and have half the dev team pissed off at you <i>because of it</i>.<p>I don&#x27;t want to get into a large discourse, but your posting stood out a bit, in a &quot;I know that pain&quot; kind of way.  I don&#x27;t know you so this may be totally wrong, but my experience has been that there are many roads to success.  Even that word &quot;success&quot; is arbitrary (as we have seen so frequently when managers redefine it after the fact).  You are allowed to choose your definition.<p>Sometimes you just aren&#x27;t up for the gunslinging heroics that are required save the project.  But you <i>might</i> be up for spending some quality time with the other developers and helping them improve themselves.  The project may tank, but everybody might end up thanking you <i>because of it</i>.  Even better, you may inspire someone else to do the necessary heroics now that they have someone to cheer them on.<p>The one (somewhat disturbing) reality that I have learned in this job is that neither my pay check, nor the way people feel about me seems particularly related to the success of any particular project.  Sometimes giving people what they <i>should</i> value (success) over what they <i>actually</i> value (support) is a form of hubris in itself.<p>Anyway, I hope that is interesting even if it doesn&#x27;t seem useful ;-)",1446461476

10491093,comment,10490548,10490548,0,0,bjshepard,,,"interesting comment from Peter Richerson:<p><i>It seems to me that political struggle can reduce inequality without necessarily [much] violence. Labor agitation in the US from the late 19th century through the 1950s played a large coercive role in reducing inequality. The US elite faced a choice, give labor a fairer share of the economic pie or eventually face revolution. Led by FDR and like minded actors, the political elite pushed the business elite to reduce inequality to avoid revolution. Whether this would have happened without two mass mobilization wars is an open question, but union organizing and the agitation of radical political parties struck fear into the elite, hence the Palmer Raids and Edgar Hoover’s excesses. But those creeps were middle class boys on the make, scaremongering the elites in the pursuit of elite position for themselves. They may have help the egalitarians be exaggerating the power of the “Reds.” A credible threat of revolution can coerce elites pretty effectively.<p>Even Gandhian non-violence can be very effective. If you can organize a large mass of non-elites fanatically committed to non-violence, the elite has to worry what might happen if the non-violent fanatics suddenly got violently angry. The CP of China seems to really fear apparently harmless mass organizations like Falun Gong. Apolitical mass organizations are a threat to elites if inegalitarian or otherwise unfair treatment of commoners is common. Any such organization can morph into violent resistance at the drop of an atrocity.</i><p>link to richerson&#x27;s work:\n<a href=""http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/richerson/richerson.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/richerson/richerson.htm</a>",1446461200

Struggling with fatigue (personally at around 8am) and not giving up is a big part of that, and if your team wants to be among the top 10, speed is a very big issue.<p>The Czechs who like puzzle hunts (such as me) will likely prefer them over room escapes as they are all cheap, non-profit, community events with a good atmosphere, whereas the room escapes are more of a product that aims at the workforce (many room escapes talk about team building in their brochures) and the prices reflect that.<p>The main downside for the foreign audience is that most Czech puzzle hunts I attended required fluency in Czech in a non-trivial way -- encoding messages in proverbs, conjugation, wordplay and so on.

This is totally wrong.<p>In my experience in silicon valley, people start with building something small/simple (but in a big market), get little drips of funding from investors as they show progress. If they fail at any point along the way, there's value in what they've created, and they exit for whatever they get. The later you exit, typically the further along you get, and the bigger the exit. That's why the diversity of outcomes in the valley are everything from zero to billions, and companies raise anywhere from zero to a dozen rounds of funding.<p>At any inflection point in the business, you have lots of options: you can sell, raise more money, raise more and cash out some shares, you can quit, you can make yourself chairman and have your cofoudner run it, you can do nothing and grow it organically, etc., etc.<p>Each one of the choices above are part of your arsenal of options at almost any point. The people who choose to raise tons of money, not cash out at all, and then who fail- well, they made a series of active decisions to do all of that. They're big boys.<p>My point is, when you're building a company you can make a lot of choices along the way, and it's not just setting out for a suicide run of either 1% of $100M or 10% of $10M. Choosing to raise outside financing is sort of like deciding whether or not you want a cofounder (or 2, or 3) - it just another form of business partner. You get less %, but hopefully they add to the business in a meaningful way that leaves you better off.",1348336675

Sildenafil totals are 1,279,500 prescribed, at a cost of 40,872,800 (Check my decimal places!) and the total for all ED meds is 84,033,500.<p>That might not sound like much - the UK wants to spend something like 500m per year just on malaria.<p>But spending on ED targets a small number of mostly old people. The QALY cost is about $11,000.  Spending on malaria targets a very large number of people, many young, but people of all ages.<p>If you want an actual trivial medication let's look at cough medicine; mostly sugary syrup with strong flavorings, sometimes with paracetamol and sometimes with other stuff.  Most doctors say it's pointless and expensive and that people do just as well with hot lemon and honey and correctly taken paracetamol.  We spend about 500m in the UK on cough mixtures.  Americans spend about $2Billion.

I lean toward the ""run screaming"" side myself.<p>The fact that they've burned through several contracting companies and still think it's possible to get large numbers of bug fixes in the first month suggests that they're pretty clueless.  It's going to take you two or three months (if not longer) just to get your head into the code enough that you can fix anything nontrivial.<p>If I were advising <i>them</i>, I would say they need two teams: one team of just two or three people (or maybe just one) solely trying to fix bugs in the existing code, and the other team of three or four people doing a complete rewrite from scratch.  As others have commented, complete rewrites are normally a bad idea, but this code base is so far gone I don't think it can be incrementally refactored into sanity.  Oh, and they should expect the rewrite to take two years.<p>But despite their experience to this point, it sounds like they're still not ready to hear that.  Which leaves you little choice but to run screaming.<p>EDITED to add: what these people need to understand is that their demand for results in a hurry <i>is what got them into this mess in the first place</i>.

4558370,comment,4555553,4555684,1,0,pasbesoin,,,"P.S.  Ok, the following is not thought out much at all and is very incomplete.  My point, if I can better make it, here, is that you <i>limit</i> users' exposure and risk via the micropayment channel.  And thereupon say, if the current balance <i>does</i> disappear (stolen, gaff, etc.), it's simply ""not the end of the world"" for that user.  Fix the problem and move forward.<p>On the receipts side, I have less to offer in terms of ideas for control of fraud.  (E.g. accumulating masses of mis-appropriated micro-transactions.)  For identifying and addressing user claims of mis-appropriated transactions.  Etc.<p>So, I sort of have what I see as ""step 1"":  Keep the users ""safe"".  I imagine step 2, ""control fraud"", has some technical remediations.<p>And, overall, keep this system <i>separate</i>, in it's own transactions ""box"", away from the larger banking and payments system.  Compartmentalize.  And then solve, within that more limited scope.<p>--<p>Technically, this seems quite feasible.  However, the regulatory infrastructure gets in the way.  I'm not arguing for mindless ""deregulation"".  (Or, as it were in recent years, also lack of enforcement.)<p>But it seems there needs to be a new class of payment for these things.  A user has a limited value account presenting limited exposure/risk.  Money can be pushed into it from a regular bank account, but it's an irreversible, one-way flow.  The user, as an example, puts in $20, $30, $50 per month and then uses this to make low-overhead micropayments.  Since exposure is limited, regulatory overhead can be kept lower.  And... regulation can in turn help ensure that such accounts and micropayments <i>are</i> created and <i>do</i> exist.  (E.g. Conventional banks:  You must support this interface to micro-payment providers as part of your license or charter.  In return, you face no liability beyond possibly restoring a mis-directed withdrawal of capped value made to ""charge"" one of these micro-payment accounts.)<p>I'm no banker.  But it seems to me that micropayments need a regulatory infrastructure that reduces/caps risk, and that also in-turn squeezes out needless and overly expensive overhead.<p>Sort of like a pre-paid Visa card, but online.  (And preferably with lower transaction fees.)<p>Why would society do this?  Why do we protect intellectual property, increasingly to the point of criminalizing infringement (and so subsidizing enforcement)?  Society attaches value to this.  Well, I think a good part of society attaches value to compensating and enabling (legitimate) content creators.  In terms of a news, many of us want to see an informed society -- one informed by independent, self-standing reporting and not just propaganda.",1348334153

I <i>loathe</i> maintenance programming, so the relationship didn't last very long -- just a few months. So:<p>1. Make sure you have a rock-solid contract in place with the client that will ensure that you get paid, get paid well, and get paid often. Receiving a check in the mail makes it easier to look at the code. If your payment terms are anything like, ""payment-upon-completion of ..."", or, ""paid net 30 after invoice"", or anything like that, you simply won't want to work on the code.<p>2. If ""soul-crushing"", ""depressing"", or ""makes me want to hang myself"" are phrases you'd use to describe the code or your state of mind when looking at it, then go into this project knowing that you're not going to last long. There are people who genuinely enjoy working on stuff like this. You aren't one of them.<p>3. Everybody that says ""rewrite"" is dreaming. It is <i>impossible</i> to rewrite something that large without breaking something and spending too much money. Re-factoring a function is doable. Re-factoring a thousand-line file is doable. Re-factoring part of a database is doable. Re-factoring all of it all at once is starry-eyed fiction. Not gonna happen.<p>4. But, if taking ownership of this code base is something you want to do, then add re-factoring time in to your agreement with the client -- something like, ""20% time spent replacing bad code"" -- and focus on the tiniest little ugly thing you can find, and re-factor that. Start on it, don't stop until it's done. Keep it in small bite-sized chunks.<p>5. Make sure you're getting paid for time spent just getting familiar with the code base. If you work with it long enough you'll actually get pretty familiar with most of it, but you want to do that on <i>their</i> dime, not yours.<p>6. Get help. They surely realize by now that they've got a mess on their hands. Talk with them about whether or not you can bring on additional help. If they flat-out refuse, <i>run</i>. (That is what killed my work with my client; I wanted to move into a position where I managed a junior programmer and focused on code rewrites and higher-level stuff; they refused, I quit. They wanted an employee, not a contractor.)<p>7. Version control and a sane bug tracking system (Mantis isn't horrible) are must-haves.

No amount of advice here will make it more palatable to you if you're not the sort of person that's OK with inheriting a disaster.<p>Also, even if you've got some kind of agreement in place with the client already, it sounds like you've just now gotten your first look at the code. This, in my opinion, makes it totally OK to go back to the client and re-negotiate. You can open it with, ""I'd like to work with you, but now that I've seen the project that you want me to work on, I can understand why this has been a problem for you, and I need to make sure that we can come to an agreement that will work for both of us so that I can fix this for you.""

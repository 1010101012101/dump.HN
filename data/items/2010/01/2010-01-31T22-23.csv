1091268,comment,1088906,1091190,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I'm familiar with the term. It's my understanding that face-to-face communications are the most impacted areas of human interaction for folks with this condition, and that online communications are easier for them, because they're on mostly equal footing with the folks they're talking to (no one can see anybodies facial expressions on the net, and so only the words themselves matter). It's one of the reasons so many of them find their way into computing and other fields that don't require direct human interaction. With Bram's intelligence, I'm certain he would be capable of effectively simulating normal human interactions online (and I've spoken to him online and he seemed perfectly normal, though he probably wasn't in a frustrated mental state at the time). He could have chosen to approach things with more civility, regardless of whether he has Asperger's or some other condition that makes human interaction in the real world difficult. The loosely realtime nature of IRC allows time for thinking over what you're saying, considering the implications, and thinking through how it will appear to others.<p>In short, I'm saying that I don't think Bram should get (or would be right to expect) a pass for being an asshole to a volunteer on FreeNode, regardless of whether he has Asperger's or not. Being an asshole isn't OK, even if you have a condition that makes it easier to be one without noticing. It just means you need to be more mindful of your behavior, since it's no one else's job to do it for you.",1264978237

Just as a 6-year-old cannot appreciate Shakespeare to the same degree that a 50-year-old English literature professor can appreciate it. How this is at all debatable, I have no idea.<p>> With time, assuming the language is used by a significant number of people, it will acquire such a history.<p>This will of course never happen.<p>> Still, while young languages don't have a rich history compared to older languages, they have other advantages (of which Lojban has plenty).<p>There are alternative solutions to requiring everyone to learn a second language. For example, expressing oneself more clearly. This can be accomplished to any desired degree in modern languages.<p>> Also remember that the history that has accrued to older languages is a double-edged sword. Because of this ""baggage"" it's sometimes difficult to express precisely what you mean without being misunderstood (or perhaps to even know what you mean -- see the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis). Lojban is designed to help overcome such difficulties.<p>On one edge of the sword: the lasting effects of the most skilled manipulators of the given language. The other edge: occasional difficulties with ambiguity and linguistic relativity. To dull the second edge, Lojban requires that we flatten the first. No thanks.",1264978015

I would very much like to learn more about this if you could send pointers.<p>To me this looks more like a device used by managements to justify their practice of share repurchase. The options should be repriced not when dividends are paid but rather when stock repurchase is done. Like you mention, stock repurchase never affects the strike price of options.

""</i><p>That statement is patently incorrect, in theory and in practice.<p>PRACTICE<p>The share price of companies that announce dividends every quarter has little immediate correlation to the dividend announced.  In the long term, companies that consistently <i>raise</i> dividends year over year actually <i>increase</i> in value.  (These are affectionately referenced as ""dividend darlings"" and are a focus of some investment strategies.)<p>THEORY<p>The purpose of a company is to <i>make money.</i>  You do this by spending capital to create a product.  Once you sell that product, you regain back the capital you invested in earnings.  The goal is to eventually make back more money in earnings than what you invested in capital.<p>If I buy a bar in my neighborhood for, say, $100k, I would expect to make money back on it.  If I worked hard to build a clientele and earned something like $30k a year from my customers (a spectacular return, by the way), then the bar would be earning money.  I could then afford to pay some of that out to the shareholders - in this case, just me.<p>What your notion of dividends seems to be is a cannibalization of the equity present in the company.  If the company has no product of intrinsic value, then yes, your example might hold true.  In the bar example, you would believe that the bar is worth <i>only</i> $100k (the price I paid) and that any money I pay out would be coming out of that $100k.  This would be true only if I did not work to get customers and therefore did not make any money over the year.<p>SUMMARY<p>For companies that provide value in the form of goods and services, the money you get out of it will be more than the money you put in.  This frequently, and oftentimes should, take the form of dividend payments.<p>ALTERNATIVE<p>Having said all that, there are very legitimate reasons why tech companies do not pay out dividends, namely that they reinvest the profits in research and development to produce new and better products.

So I suppose all those translations of Shakespeare in to hundreds of human languages isn't enough either; and anyone who claims Shakespeare can be appreciated in anything but English is just ""lying to himself and others"" (as you said in an earlier post).<p>Sure, any young language isn't going to have a rich history of expressions weighed down with meaning.  But I don't think that has anything to do with whether the language is deliberately invented or not.  With time, assuming the language is used by a significant number of people, it will acquire such a history.<p>Still, while young languages don't have a rich history compared to older languages, they have other advantages (of which Lojban has plenty).<p>Also remember that the history that has accrued to older languages is a double-edged sword.  Because of this ""baggage"" it's sometimes difficult to express precisely what you mean without being misunderstood (or perhaps to even know what you mean -- see the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis).  Lojban is designed to help overcome such difficulties.<p>The other thing to note is that the weighty phrases like ""wherefore art thou Romeo?"" aren't used very much in everyday speech.  It's not like we go around constantly quoting Shakespeare at one another (except occasionally for effect, or humor).  We generally communicate using rather simple language and concepts that should have no problem being expressed in even a young (but expressive) language like Lojban.",1264976292

The other reason for this belief is the shareholders themselves who let management invest profits in any project they want in the hope of ever increasing profits and stock price.<p>About microsoft's dividends, one thing the article misses is that msft's payout is very high but most of it is via stock repurchases.
The reality is that managements of all companies - tech or otherwise - concentrate on their own interests. That is why you see companies spending so much on stock repurchases rather than pure dividends. In theory it reduces the number of shares - but in practice it is a device to prop up the stock price so stock options or stock price linked benefits for employees and management are profitable. Microsoft spends disproportionately higher on stock repurchases compared to dividends. If they paid all that money as dividends, it would be a very decent dividend paying company.",1264975913

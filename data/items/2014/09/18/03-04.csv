The safest place for an inmate to store anything is in his rectum, and to keep the orifice supple and sized for the (contraband) phone, inmates have been known to whittle their bars of soap and tuck them away as a placeholder while their phones are in use. So a short and stubby bar means a durable old dumbphone; broad and flat means a BlackBerry or an iPhone. Pity the poor guy whose bar of soap is the size and shape of a Samsung Galaxy Note.&quot;<p>This stinks of the standard urban legend trope structure, and with that in mind, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s true. There&#x27;s absolutely not reason to keep an ass pocket supple and sized for contraband. And it&#x27;s absolutely not true that you need a place holder for the contraband, when the contraband in not being hidden there.<p>Lastly, regularly putting a bar of soap in one&#x27;s anus would be incredibly uncomfortable, and inmates would quickly stop that process, replacing it - if it was really needed in the first place - with something plastic and chemically inert.<p><a href=""http://drbenkim.com/dont-use-soap-private-parts.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drbenkim.com/dont-use-soap-private-parts.htm</a><p>How do I know?

And sure there&#x27;s good and not-so-good fiction and the movies show it.  When he brought up the possibility of a great story not based on idiotic behavior I too immediately thought of <i>Apollo 13</i>, truly spellbinding in its entirety.<p>Then again, if idiocy sells, it&#x27;s natural that producers will make idiotic plots a priority, though if only limited to movies, there wouldn&#x27;t be much to write about.  The bigger thing it points to is the way really important discourse has increasingly become infested with the very same attribute.<p>After all, in recent years TV news has become more or less devoid of authentic news reports.  Calling TV news &quot;sensationalistic&quot; is hard new, not only failing to qualify as factual, but even if intended as entertainment, it&#x27;s lousy fiction every bit as idiotic as a B-movie.  People do watch it though, and that what counts.<p>To the extent idiot plots are the standard in national and local politics, it&#x27;s far more damaging than the movies, but perhaps the point is the same roots underlie a whole gamut of idiotic forms.  But where are the rest of us who are not idiots?  What trouble do we go to express our non-idiotic ideas where it does some good?  (I suspect posting here is more or less like preaching to the choir.)<p>Ultimately fiction is so much less compelling than real life.  I love a good story well told, but it pales next to the meaning of actual experience, provided one is tuned in to experience as it is.  The article hints at something not quite said.  We humans so often accept fiction and discard reality, we don&#x27;t or even refuse to see what we are seeing.

For instance you can take a candidate to a code review and see what kind of inputs they contribute to the discussion. This alone will give you good deal of idea on how well they understand code and quality. There are other ways, like say asking them to write unit test cases for a class- That would give a lot of idea on how they think with regards to breaking and fixing things.<p>One more way I have after doing basic checks is pair programming, or picking a totally new problem and working with the candidate to see how they think, how they work and how good their communication skills are.<p>There are many other ways too.

For example:<p>Many sites (including both Wikipedia and HN) practice responsive design, where the width & layout of screen elements adapts to the size of your window.  There&#x27;s a good argument that providing the user control of their own situation outweighs the consensus research on the &quot;average user&quot;.  After all, you&#x27;re trying to make <i>each</i> user happy, you aren&#x27;t trying to make a hypothetical average user happy.<p>Most of the time, users skim sites, they don&#x27;t read them.  Optimizing for reading is counterproductive when the user just wants to find a sentence or two and go away.<p>Sites can become aesthetically unpleasant if they have a small column of text and a gigantic amount of whitespace.  Nobody reads the site when the user bounces.<p>Sometimes sites are set up to use indentation to convey hierarchy, eg. in comment threads.  These can also look awkward if the right margin keeps shifting over with each new comment.  (Although personally, I prefer that to having tiny little comments that are 2-3 words wide.)<p>There&#x27;s a meta-point here: oftentimes, academic research into one specific area is not relevant to a larger product, because there are other trade-offs that have to be made.  When I first went into software, I wondered why all this cool academic research into programming language design was being totally ignored.  It turns out that oftentimes the really cool language features like macros, type inference, predicate dispatch, tail-call optimization, etc. have side-effects that make them impractical for use in a real software system.",1411011531

None of these corporations say &quot;we do not provide access to your data&quot; they say &quot;we do not provide access to our servers&quot;.

It took me a month to get one, and I almost missed my chance(again). The Transformer is really the first non-iPad tablet to get it right, IMO. It's fast, stable, the screen is beautiful, and everything works. \nThe Xoom had a shot, but too many features were not working when the tablet was shipped. Now that they are working, it's kind of too late, since Motorola has already put a bad taste in consumers' mouths. \nThe other side is effective marketing.  Apple is the first tech company to put together appealing commercials that make people(non-geek) want their products, without really knowing why they want them. The iPad is decent (I own one of those as well), but it doesn't really offer much more than a well-made Android tablet. Apple has done well in making their product look cool.",1308592775

When viewing photo A2, which does show any text box yet, by sliding vertically I am expressing the intention: ""Let me view photo B1"".<p>There is no text box yet. Therefore, by scrolling down the app cannot possible perceive my action as intending to scroll the text. And yet your app decides that's what it means, and shows the text box out of the blue. It's simple causality. If vertical scrolling is to fullfill the intention ""Let me view more text than is currently on screen"", then the text box <i>needs</i> to be visible <i>at all times</i>.

2675018,comment,2674175,2674175,5,0,F_J_H,,,"tldr: Different buyers will value your company differently for different reasons, and understanding what specifically a buyer values will help you negotiate better.<p>I suspect the members of the HN community who are at the point of selling their businesses understand this fairly well.<p>At then end of the day, before someone within a buyer organization (which are typically larger, fairly structured companies) will have to put together a business case, and as with any business case, it will need to include financials, multiples, valuations, etc. - the CFO will have to be convinced it is a good deal.  (Unless you are Facebook, Groupon, airbnb, etc. of course, but note that the majority of exits are not of this size and so valuations will not be as ""frothy"" (see slide #4 of Mark Suster’s recent presentation <a href=""http://www.theequitykicker.com/2011/06/17/mark-suster-getting-funded-in-a-frothy-market/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheEquityKicker+%28The+Equity+Kicker%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theequitykicker.com/2011/06/17/mark-suster-gettin...</a> ) \nMost businesses sold in the US are not anywhere near as sexy as the latest ""Tech Crunch reviewed"" or YCombinator startup and the reasons for acquisitions tend to be less driven by speculation and therefore financials, multiples etc. will be more examined more carefully. So, understanding the multiples that exist in your industry is very important.<p>If you are looking to sell your company, one of the best ways to ensure you are getting the best price is by going through a competitive auction process, which are typically led by an M & A firm or Investment Bank.  (Boutique firms exist for smaller companies that have not yet achieved the oft desired ""2 and 10"").  Yes, they will take their cut, but typically you will get a higher price than if you shop it yourself to a few buyers who you think will be interested. Following the ""market it yourself"" approach may cause you to overlook a buyer who is not obvious to you, but who would be very interested in your business for reasons you never thought of and therefore would be willing to pay what it takes to acquire it.  (I have experienced this first hand.)<p>When all is said and done, your business is worth what someone is willing to pay for it.  Going through a competitive auction, especially if marketed properly to large buyer audience, will ensure you get the highest price, regardless of the buyer’s motive for the acquisition, (which you could only speculate on anyway.)",1308589378

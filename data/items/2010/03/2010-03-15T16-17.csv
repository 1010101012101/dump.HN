(which I <i>loathe</i>) ""we're all 'down' over here and can't get anything!  HELP!  SORRY FOR BUGGING YOU!""<p>This drives me insane because:<p>A) Stop using ""help"", you're not 6 years old, you haven't fallen down a well<p>B) You know how to change the toner, there is a <i>stack</i> of toners sitting right next to your printer.<p>C) You're not ""down"", ""everyone"" is not ""down""...<i>you</i> specifically cannot print, the printer is <i>telling</i> you that you can't print, and it's even <i>telling</i> you how to fix the problem, just LOOK AT IT!<p>D) Saying ""sorry for bugging you"" has got to be one of the most obnoxious things you could even possibly say.

At the moment, banks are building up stock with cheap money from the Fed (at least that what I think they are doing) and credit should ease once they do so (as I believe it is doing currently).

It's easier to force GE to pay the correct payroll taxes for 100K employees than it is to police thousands of single-employee ""companies"" that file Schedule C's.<p>2.  The government has co-opted corporations into providing pieces of the social safety net such as unemployment benefits, health insurance, etc.  If a minimum wage employee was offered $1/hour more to be a contractor, he might take it.  Then, if laid off, he might go on welfare instead of unemployment insurance paid for by the employer's contributions.  Employment law enforces a bunch of social safety net stuff which can be circumvented by contractors.<p>3.  Net taxes paid would decrease if everyone was a contractor.

These aren't dealbreakers for most people.<p>Instant messaging works fine via Push Notifications. Maybe not perfectly the way you want it to, but well enough that I don't have any problem with it and there's no concern of it eating my battery. Everything in life is about trade-offs. You can't have the good without the bad... or at least it takes a LOT of work to achieve that. Understanding that is key to good product design and sometimes it seems to me that Apple's the only one in this industry that does.<p>Pandora works fine in the car. It doesn't work fine to leave it running and do something else. But when one is driving, it's fine. Yeah, you can't use your map while your music keeps running. Again, not a dealbreaker.

You wouldn't know that from the reams that have been written about how we absolutely must have multitasking or the device is junk.<p>Anyway, all of the points you raised are ones on which people can have legitimate gripes with the device. They and other capabilities may be lacking that make the device not fit their needs. Apple ain't gonna add a bunch of stuff to the homescreen because that's not within their aesthetic. I'm fine with that -- prefer it even. There's a value in things being calm and serene. For me it outweighs the value of having the city I'm in written on my homescreen. Both choices are fine and that's my whole point: unless/until Apple becomes a monopoly (which is not even remotely in sight), there's no reason to call them evil over the App Store's restrictions -- just don't buy/develop for their phone if you don't like it. LOTS of people really, really do, so it's nonsensical to call the device junk, either. There are lots of choices for those who don't like it. And it's rare anymore for things to lock you in (like how it used to be in the bad old days) to proprietary formats that you can't possibly move aways from even if you desperately want to. I haven't heard a single person say that they hate their iPhone but just can't move away because of X. If X being missing is a big enough deal, people just switch. YAY!

From what I understand of Google's work, they really have improved tremendously from analyzing data (to find how searches go wrong), and from using the data in new features (such as with spell checking, adding new terms into the query, personalizing searches, etc.).<p>And I mean, I value privacy. I do. But, I value the quality of the search results even more than whatever privacy is lost from search engines logging, I guess. Unless there is some path to improvement, all I can ever see myself using Duck Duck Go for is porn, tips on murdering my spouses, and information on illegal drugs. Of course, other people would use it for much more-- but for me, there something truly wonderful about being able to search for ""nose"" and have the first result be a unit test runner I want to use, not a piece of anatomy I already know everything I need to about. Sure, it's stupid-- I should search for ""nose tests"", but I sometimes make mistakes, and here Google doesn't even need to say so and make me try again. It finds the target anyway, without problems (and the less-likely Wikipedia article is right below, as result #2). Without Google logging what I searched for and building a profile, this wouldn't be possible.<p>I don't mean to be fanboyish and loving of Google (they do scare me sometimes). If they added some sort of feature that said, ""don't record anything I do right now with these searches"", I would be very happy. But, similarly, I would also be happy if Duck Duck Go at least had an option to opt-<i>in</i> to logging and monitoring and so on.

1193248,comment,1192996,1193145,0,0,timwiseman,,,"I see where you are coming from, but there are a couple of things I think you should consider.<p>First, that ""unreliable online material"" is likely a social networking site and can be tied to the person in question with a high degree of reliability.  This is certainly not perfect, mistaken identity is always possible, as is impersonation, but on social networking sites you can normally say it is more likely than not the right person.  I am not saying that it is right to make judgements on someone's employability based on those sites, just that you can often be pretty confident you are talking about the right person.<p>Next, the rational for rejecting an applicant is very frequently ""We found a better candidate.""  Now, the reason they judged that other candidate to be better might be because they found something they didn't like about applicant A on the internet, but that is still often going to be the rationale.",1268669293

1193246,comment,1192823,1192823,0,0,JangoSteve,,,"I built an app last year for a client that included doing booking for dentist offices. One of the big things in getting people to use a new booking tool for their business is to allow them to block out times and business hours, before allowing others to just start creating appointments all willy-nilly.<p>Also, it's important to allow the business owner to set a minimum clearance for new appointments. E.g. if a dentist decides that they need at least an hour-block for a half-hour appointment (prep and cleanup time, etc), then the calendar shouldn't allow a patient to schedule an appointment in a half-hour opening.<p>But overall, I'm also unclear on how this alternative is better than Google Calendar? Is there a private-label version that could be integrated easily into my own site? Though, I guess Google Calendar now kinda has that as well.",1268669268

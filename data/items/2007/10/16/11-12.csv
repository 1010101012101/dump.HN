(We're also still using his M2 .50 cal machine gun with no <i>real</i> need to replace it, just as there was no real reason to replace the M1911.)<p>But if you combine ""random tinkering"" with ""European math"" (i.e. Tesla and the polyphase AC that Edison could not do the math for), now, there you <i>really</i> have something.<p>When I read some histories of the founding concepts of MIT, it was very clear they desired to meld these two powerful themes into something new, the motto Mens et Manus (Mind and Hand) and the seal expressing this quite clearly.<p>And while I understand that a lot of you all who are focused on a niche that richly rewards ""random tinkering"" don't think there's much value add to e.g. the sorts of engineers that MIT turns out, I submit to you that you wouldn't be here unless you were standing on the shoulders of the people who produced artifacts like the transistor, the IC and TCP/IP (and maybe even ACID databases :-), none of which were pure ""random tinkering"".<p>To recast this a bit, maybe look at it through Clayton Christensen's lens:<p>The transistor, IC and TCP/IP were all sustaining innovations, replacing the tube, mechanically integrated modules and previous networking systems respectively.  Each dropped right into the place of their predecessors with the usual teething pains, but represented qualitative improvements that in a while were game changers.<p>What you are doing is disruptive innovation at its finest (read <i>The Innovator's Dilemma</i> for the full treatment).<p>There's a place for both, but I believe that while what one is working on might strongly emphasize one or the other, one should be reasonably grounded in both.<p>Otherwise you might find your lunch eaten by a disruptive innovation, or hit a brick wall when you're in the sustaining axis and e.g. something doesn't scale in an important way.<p>(And I thank keaneu for reminding why I dropped my subscription to <i>Forbes</i> a <i>long</i> time ago (before SCO vs. The World). :-)\n",1192535928
68468,comment,68455,68455,0,0,pg,,,"And yet that's exactly the business we're in.  I just stopped in to check Hacker News before getting on with reading applications, which consists of trying to predict who will change the world, and the top story is that one can't.<p>I agree with this essay, but I don't think the title is quite right.  All the people who've changed the world have been energetic and determined.  So you can to some extent predict by recognizing those qualities.  You can predict the people, just not what the ideas will turn out to be.  The title should have been ""You can't predict how the world will change.""",1192535922
68467,comment,68345,68400,0,0,robg,,,"Ignore those low-recognized submissions and the associated points.<p>By ""integrity"", I just meant a way to protect from drift. If the early users ""know"" the community, and they soon get overrun by newbies (the Reddit phenomenon), then why not give those early/frequent users a greater voice? A newbie would still get their voice amplified as they show they ""understand"" the community (i.e., accumulated karma).<p>I'm cool with editors fixing and deleting posts. But amplifying their voice in votes seems more problematic - both technically and from a community-stand point. Why not let the ""best"" voters simply emerge from the community esprit de corps? That's not to say a great voter is anyone above some predetermined ceiling - just that community knowledge increases as a function of karma - weight the votes accordingly and you protect the community while respecting every user's contribution.",1192535542

68464,comment,68345,68454,0,0,robg,,,"I suppose you'd just have to exclude submissions where the total points never reached some predetermined floor - say 5 or 10 points. That would eliminate all the points accumulated from submissions and comments that were not received well. And you'd still have a measure of the users who ""understand"" the community. ",1192534715
68463,comment,68450,68450,0,0,dzorz,,,"> And, closer to something I've needed more than once, how do you give your program an int and string version number with only one thing to modify?<p>This is not very elegant, and you have to split your version number to major and minor part, but it does the job. Oh, yes, minor version must be between 0 and 99 (inclusive).<p><pre><code>    #define VERSION_MAJOR 2\n    #define VERSION_MINOR 9\n\n    #define VERSION_INT (VERSION_MAJOR * 100 + VERSION_MINOR)\n    #define STRINGIFY2(x) #x\n    #define STRINGIFY(x) STRINGIFY2(x)\n    #if VERSION_MINOR<10\n    #define VERSION_STR STRINGIFY(VERSION_MAJOR) "".0"" STRINGIFY(VERSION_MINOR)\n    #else\n    #define VERSION_STR STRINGIFY(VERSION_MAJOR) "".""

I posted in an share-your-ideas last week about making a site that agragates the agregation sites and it seems that's just what picurls.com is all about. Taking the pictures from other sites like digg, readdit, del.icio.us and puting it all toghether.

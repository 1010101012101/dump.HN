971532,comment,971454,971454,0,0,pxlpshr,,,"This is an interesting question because I spent the better half a year ignoring consulting work and focusing solely on our mobile software company. So if you include opportunity costs, you could say about $60k was ""spent"" over the course of about a year (about $5-7k or so was hard cash, the rest was 6-months of not doing service-related work).<p>The company became ramen profitable pretty quickly but I went back to doing part-time consulting work to maintain a lifestyle. As the AppStore grew exponentially, our apps pretty much remained ramen profitable. We missed our opportunity to make a bigger return when we launched our first app in Nov/Dec 08. Part of that was my fault based on how I setup the company, and being way to tolerant of lack of effort from developer-partners. Fortunately I learned my lesson with my own money.<p>We received angel funding about a month ago to start a new company, we'll have 1 (maybe 2) apps on iTunes but we won't be solely dependent on it for our success. This will let us stay focused on making a really fantastic mobile app, not only for Apple but also for Android and other platforms.<p>Right now I'm trying to decide if I should sell my former small business on SitePoint or something. I'm not sure we'd get much for it but it would be nice to put a nail in the coffin since I don't have time to really maintain the company. Anyone have any experience with small sales like this?",1259729810

I think that is a pretty useless statistic but, hey, full disclosure.",1259729560

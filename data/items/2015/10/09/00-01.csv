10357465,comment,10357115,10357115,0,0,nrjames,,,"This sounds so familiar... Here&#x27;s a story about my 1961 house that is built on concrete slabs.<p>About 18 months ago, we noticed a bit of the hardwood floor was bubbling up. We ignored it. About 6 months ago, our water pressure started to drop and then disappeared altogether. The plumber came and told us that our well pump (which was relatively new) wasn&#x27;t working. They pulled the pump and the PVC bushing around it was cracked, so it had been running nonstop trying to keep pressure up. Plumbers fixed the crack, put the pump back in, it still wasn&#x27;t working... They pulled it again and replaced it.<p>I mentioned to the plumber that the floor was bubbling up and he told me that what likely happened is that the supply line was leaking under the slab (where they put them in the 1960s), probably causing the floor to bubble and the well pump to turn on and off frequently, increasing torque on the bushing, which caused it to crack and subsequently burn out the motor. He referred me to a contracting group that could help with the problem under the slab.<p>Fast forward to June of this year. Contractors begin to pull up the wooden floor, only to find there&#x27;s asbestos-laden linoleum under it. An asbestos remediation firm came and removed the entire wooden floor and the asbestos. (Note: the wooden floor was parquet, of a formerly-standard size that no longer is made, meaning to replace it and match the rest of the house, we would have to find somebody to cut each tiny little board.)<p>Early July, contractors jackhammer into the slab and cannot find a leak. While investigating, we discover that the septic tank is full and backed up, likely from some landscapers running over the septic field with a bobcat about 3 yrs ago. It had been slowly draining and we had it serviced 18 months ago, but it was again full and plumbers began to speculate that sewage was standing in the lines under the house and that an old septic line was leaking -- not the supply line. Nobody can figure out what to do because the original plans to the house are missing, the plans to an addition are missing, and nobody knows where the supply lines or septic really run, in spite of the fact they had snaked cameras through them 4 times.<p>Meanwhile, we have a huge hole with ragged pieces of rebar and concrete everywhere in our family room. My 2 and 4 yr old daughters learn to walk around it carefully because it&#x27;s impossible to get to the kitchen without walking through the family room.<p>Plumbers come back 4 weeks later with a plan to replace the supply lines and the septic lines. We have to take a break to get insurance approval and take out a HELOC to cover costs that insurance won&#x27;t cover. This takes a while.<p>Ten weeks after the first hole in the slab, they start digging to replace the septic/supply lines and they mistakenly break into the air ducts running under the slab (the fancy new thing to do in 1961). Surprise: the air ducts are made of a fibrous material that sort of looks like cardboard but might contain asbestos.<p>Today, the asbestos remediation people came and took a sample. The HVAC repair people (took 4 companies to find somebody to attempt to repair the &#x27;cardboard&#x27; ducts) put a camera in them and found that the vibrations from the jackhammer used to cut the slab (likely) had caused many other collapses in the air ducts in the same room. The only saving grace here is that it appears that the &#x27;cardboard&#x27; ducts only were used in that room and that they are metal in the rest of the house (please please please). Now, the demolition team has to come back and remove most of the rest of the slab in that room and in the kitchen in order to replace the &#x27;cardboard&#x27; ducts that are collapsed; all prior to doing final repairs on the supply and septic lines running under the slab. When that&#x27;s done, we&#x27;ll have to repair the slab, get new floors, new kitchen countertops, and hope that we can move back in.<p>We&#x27;ve been in a hotel with our two daughters on-and-off for the past 3 months. I really hope we&#x27;re in the house by Christmas.<p>Please be very careful if you purchase an old house.<p>Here are some pictures: <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/JxiKl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/JxiKl</a><p>FYI, ours is an old Westinghouse Total Electric Model Home (pdf): <a href=""http://www.ncmodernist.org/westinghousehousebroch.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncmodernist.org/westinghousehousebroch.pdf</a><p>p.s.

This way incentives are aligned - the insured want the insurance to act fairly, even with respect to others<p>That doesn&#x27;t really align incentives, though. There&#x27;s really no benefit to each individual to approving another person&#x27;s claim (all it means is less money in the pot).<p>Claims are rare enough that it&#x27;s not enough to simply say &#x27;if you vote this way for someone else, we&#x27;ll apply the policy consistently for you&#x27;, since the expected number of claims that a person is likely to file over the course of their plan is close to zero.<p>(And even if it weren&#x27;t, the whole issue is that insurance has relatively well-written rules for clear-cut cases, but the complaints people have - like this one - are generally about the interpretation of those policies for special cases, since policies can&#x27;t possibly enumerate every possible outcome.)",1444352219

Apparently because it was an &quot;Act of god&quot; (a hailstorm, with what looks like fist-sized-rock-hail in that every piece of glass and most trim on the car had holes in it, although I&#x27;d argue the insurance was for the idiot driver who didn&#x27;t pull over or cover his load.) the insurance company refused to do squat.  The car was only blue booked at 5k at the time, but we had to replace it with a 25k car, so I count that as a decent amount of loss.<p>To bring this back to topic, I would gladly get on board with any plan to fix &quot;insurance&quot;.  It really feels like less insurance and more government mandated protection money ; but that seems to be the fundamental problem, that reforming insurance is almost paramount to reforming finance.  How do you even begin to make headway against an entity with that much power/influence and tentacles already so deep in these processes?<p>(edit re: protection money; the gist of it is anger that if you fall on a &quot;responsible/lucky&quot; part of the bell curve, you&#x27;ll likely end up paying out for FAR more than you ever get back while simultaneously watching the insurance company often do everything in their power to NOT come through when they should.

Perhaps it&#x27;s different in the US (I&#x27;m an academic in Australia at UNE), but in the Australian system, the system is designed so that the student has a great deal of freedom.<p>Ultimately, it is geared around your two major milestones of confirmation (at 1 year) and submission (at 3-4 years). As your supervisor is not an examiner for your thesis at submission, this means that you are very much in control of what you do and write in your PhD. Your supervision team are your board of advisors, not actually your boss. (Though usually their advice is good, well-intentioned, and worth heeding.)<p>This does mean that in grants, we have to be a little careful what we say will be done by PhD students, because it&#x27;s always possible they&#x27;ll head in a different direction instead!<p>Actually, as I understand it (I&#x27;m a fairly junior academic) most Australian academics prefer capable independently-minded students. That&#x27;s not just because we&#x27;re nice people, but because that&#x27;s how the incentives work -- we&#x27;re all time pressured, so students who we can be confident will produce a good thesis with just a bit of direction and advice are like gold dust. Ones that we need to give more direction to are also good -- we&#x27;ve been through the process a few times and can design some PhD-shaped research for you to do. Not-so-capable independently-minded students I guess could be a bit trickier, as it could take quite a lot of time and effort to get their research into a shape that will be approved by the external examiner. (I&#x27;m yet to encounter the last category though.)<p>But I&#x27;m yet to hear of a 2am email that a student must answer at 2am.<p>But then, Australian PhDs tend to be 3-4 years&#x27; pure research, rather than 5+ years including lots of TA work, so there are a few differences in the system.",1444351421

10357389,comment,10352189,10356823,0,0,notahacker,,,"The question asked didn&#x27;t mention the World Bank or any other definition of poverty, at least not judging from the results presentation. The World Bank, incidentally, has multiple definitions of extreme poverty, although all of them are lower than reasonable industrialised-world thresholds.<p>When around half the world&#x27;s population&#x27;s weekly purchasing power is, according to official World Bank approved statistics, equivalent to the purchasing power an American obtains after a five hours work on federal minimum wage[1] I don&#x27;t think that Americans are unjustified in not knowing the &quot;correct&quot; conclusion that numbers or proportions of people in extreme poverty have &quot;nearly halved&quot; in recent years. If you think the unspecified extreme poverty bracket <i>ought</i> to include the ~50% of the population still stuck at $5 per day, it would have been literally impossible for the proportion of people in that bracket to have already halved in recent years.<p>I&#x27;d have accepted that it might appear a bit ridiculous for them to think that extreme poverty had doubled - especially given that it is so pervasive - except... they could have been inferring it from a doubling of &quot;extreme poverty&quot; reported in some studies focusing on their own country[2]. I assume results of papers like this get more mainstream coverage in US media:\n<a href=""http://npc.umich.edu/publications/policy_briefs/brief28/policybrief28.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://npc.umich.edu/publications/policy_briefs/brief28/poli...</a>\nSo perhaps some Americans don&#x27;t think the world extends beyond the boundaries of their country; perhaps as you suggest they guessed on a multiple choice question based on having seen lots of reports on epidemics and war in the news. As I said, I&#x27;m the last person to defend the wisdom of Americans or any other type of crowd. But frankly, it&#x27;s no less ignorant to insist that everybody should know &quot;extreme poverty has halved&quot; when the basis for that &quot;fact&quot; is predicated on the assumption that people earning $1.30 a day no longer qualify as extremely poor, even if other factors like working conditions have got worse. They&#x27;re certainly right not to take that stat at face value.<p>We know medicine and access to it is getting better and that&#x27;s having effects in lives saved. We know some of the GDP per capita increases are trickling down, even though our methodology for estimating how that affects the base of the pyramid is necessarily imperfect. But I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re anywhere near the level of confidence of sustained global reduction in absolute poverty - as opposed to amelioration of its most acute symptoms - to be in a position to start celebrating how few people are really poor, never mind criticising the public for not being aware of it.<p>Not when - I really can&#x27;t stress this enough - most of the world&#x27;s population still have to survive for a week on the notionally equivalent purchasing power of an American working less than a full day&#x27;s shift at Walmart.[3] That proportion certainly hasn&#x27;t &quot;nearly halved&quot; and it&#x27;s really <i>not</i> stupid or ignorant to think that the label &quot;extreme poverty&quot; could still apply to all those people<p>[1]if you believe PPP calculations, which are inadequate for this sort of thing since the weighting basket tends to include luxuries and so doesn&#x27;t account for how cheap food and living  has to be in most of the developing world. But again I don&#x27;t think the inadequacy of measurement detracts from my point about poverty statistics being very much open for debate.\n[2]using a different World Bank definition of extreme poverty.\n[3]It&#x27;s not that there&#x27;s no validity to arguments that these people aren&#x27;t <i>extremely</i> poor; I just don&#x27;t see any reason why the argument that some of them are not should form the basis for widely accepted &quot;facts&quot;. I&#x27;ve met people on that level of income in developing countries I wouldn&#x27;t consider extremely poor of course. Then again, I&#x27;ve also met people literally killing themselves to earn $10 a day who I wouldn&#x27;t consider anything other than extremely poor, even after accounting for it being considered a good income locally. Adjusted income-based measures of poverty don&#x27;t really have anything going for them other than relative convenience.",1444351284

10357256,comment,10355508,10356913,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Bitcoin uses a proof of work system as a form of security in a decentralised system. At the end of the day, there&#x27;s a certain cost per block, which approaches the reward for mining that block. Today you can fit hundreds of transactions into one such block, imagine a block like a mail package that holds all the world&#x27;s transactions of the last 10 minutes or so, which is sent to everyone else who record those transactions, and imagine posting that package has a price. It&#x27;s technically an incorrect analogy but it&#x27;s just that, an analogy. But here&#x27;s the thing, the block is digital and as bandwidth, storage and CPU inevitably scales up, you can eventually fit millions of transactions in that block, making each individual transaction much cheaper (despite the fact block rewards go up, too). And that&#x27;s been the trend so far, every year transaction costs drop and electricity costs per value of money sent drops. It&#x27;s quite likely that if bitcoin does become a popularly used worldwide digital ledger that the cost of electricity would be pretty trivial, to register any entry on the ledger (which could represent say 0.0001 bitcoin, but it could also represent a barrel of oil, or a million barrels of oil or a billion dollars, if you wanted to. Once you have a ledger you can write to you can make it represent anything you want really).<p>In short, the claim isn&#x27;t incorrect today, it uses a lot of energy relative to its utility as a value network, but it&#x27;s one of those things where the theory on paper, and the current trends in practice, show that the problem will solve itself over time. It reminds me of the endless stream of journalists decades ago who kept saying solar had no future because its embodied energy was more than it could generate, which was a partial truth in the 1980s and one that was rarely mentioned alongside the fact in theory it didn&#x27;t have to be this way and in practice the trend showed it was getting solved over time. Today payback times of embodied energy went down from 50 years (for panels with a 20 year lifespan) to a fraction of a single year. Funny enough, you can still find people saying these things to this very day, ah well.<p>If you want to know the rough numbers... well money spent on getting x reward will approach x. Assuming 75% of the money miners spend on getting the block reward (the other 25% going to manufacturing or procuring the hardware, management etc etc), and knowing the price of a bitcoin is $240 and every day roughly 3600 coins are mined, then electricity expenditure is about $650k per day worldwide. Worldwide electricity consumption is about $3 billion (very much a back of the envelope calculation) a day at a hypothetical 10c a kwh, for the US alone total energy expenditures exceed a trillion a year. Bitcoin today is relatively wasteful for the utility it provides today that&#x27;s for certain, but it&#x27;s looking pretty good for the future, and in the grand scheme of things it&#x27;s a really tiny operation in absolute terms.<p>What&#x27;s interesting is that a lot of the bitcoin mining has sought out cheap electricity, e.g. Iceland where renewables are between 99 and 100% of electricity, there&#x27;s a limited environmental impact to mining there and as prices are so cheap, multiple big miners have set up shop there in the past.<p>Finally it&#x27;s important to realise that the cost of validating a transaction is pretty much near zero. The electricity waste is in the proof of work, which is hashing and it&#x27;s just as hard whether you hash 1 or 1 trillion transactions. Further, the amount wasted is based on the block reward which is ridiculously high in the first years of bitcoin because of its distribution system. When the block reward drops, the amount of waste drops, and every day this inches closer to a more market-driven price of a transaction, thereby reward for mining and thereby the cost of waste invested to reap that reward. In short we&#x27;re seeing, by design, a few years of ridiculously high waste-per-value transmitted to essentially kickstart the bitcoin ecosystem and distribute bitcoins, which drops every year. So again, the waste isn&#x27;t necessarily tied to a transaction, whether a block has 0 transactions or a million, is no different for hashing and 99% of the reward today is still the block reward (i.e., irrespective of the amount of transactions). So anyone citing a cost per transaction figure is very misleading even though it&#x27;s not incorrect in some way, because that cost is not marginal but fixed and exists even if there are 0 transactions and is therefore not a &#x27;per transaction&#x27; cost. A bit like if you maintain a bridge for $100 a day and 1 person walks on it, doesn&#x27;t mean the cost of walking on the bridge is $100 per person, it&#x27;s actually 0 because if you walk 0 or 100 people over the bridge, the fixed cost is always $100 and the marginal cost is always $0. Obviously a bridge has capacity limitations, but bitcoin as a digital ledger has much fewer. The total bandwidth of bitcoin today, no joke, is 1 mb per 10 minutes, or about 1.7 kb per second. We could increase that by orders of magnitude in the coming years and be okay, meaning whatever &#x27;cost per transaction&#x27; anyone cites would also drop by orders of magnitude. Anyway I&#x27;m rambling but the cost/waste argument always feels a bit disingenuous given a medium to long-term context in which it gets less wasteful every year, and given in the short-term it&#x27;s pretty minor in absolute terms anyway.",1444349084

I gave you two sources with similar definitions. It means simply the laws related to the the production, sale, ownership, use, etc. of a gun and its ancillary components.<p>If your example regulations were in place, they would be considered part of gun control. Even if they are not in place, there can still be gun control.<p>The question I think you want to ask is &quot;what gun controls do you want&quot;? Not &quot;what is gun control.&quot;<p>For purposes of this discussion, define &quot;gun control&quot; as having policies which are essentially identical to those of (your preference) Australia, or Sweden, or Japan.<p>I think that&#x27;s as simple and unambiguous as you are going to get, and will satisfy most people interested in stricter laws.<p>>  In the next sentence they are talking about cops not having to worry about people shooting them<p>That comment is a continuation of the thread, which started with statistics of the number of civilians killed by police officers.<p>> That, to me, implies that, to this person, &quot;gun control&quot; might mean something approaching total disarmament of the population, criminals included.<p>Again, &quot;gun control&quot; here is a synecdoche to mean &quot;stricter gun control.&quot; Countries with strict gun controls, like Australia and Sweden, have a lot of private gun ownership, for hunting and target shooting. So no, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean &#x27;total disarmament of the population&#x27;.<p>Here&#x27;s a hypothetical that might help understand the difference. Suppose hunting rifles are allowed, but hand guns are not. It&#x27;s pretty hard to conceal a rifle as you go around town, especially since the law requires that it be locked up in a case when in transit, or stored in the house.<p>This means it&#x27;s less likely that a petty thief will be carrying a gun to commit a crime. This means it&#x27;s less likely that a drug dealer will be carrying a gun as protection against potential thieves.<p>In general, many police reports which involve the forceful police attack on what turns out to be the wrong person are justified because of the likelihood that the actual criminal is likely to have a gun, and may respond with a gunfight. For example, SWAT teams are often called out for low-level drug dealers. The assumption is that a dealer is likely to be armed. The team is figuratively armed for bear; expecting the worst possible case. Sometimes they end up killing or seriously injuring innocent people, including by forceful entry of the wrong house.<p>If years of SWAT team calls were go out, where no one ever has a gun, then it will be increasingly hard to justify the expense of a SWAT team and the deaths that sometimes occur when in a hair-trigger mode.<p>That was the statistics that the OP was referring to. That was the gun control style that the earlier poster was referring to. Very few seriously propose a &#x27;total disarmament of the population&#x27;, and if you had researched the topic you would have quickly learned that.",1444348872

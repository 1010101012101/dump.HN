4747480,comment,4747390,4747390,12,0,freditup,,,"I disagree actually. I think having a specialization (front-end vs. back-end for example) is a good thing. It allows someone to dedicate themselves to one specific area and learn it thoroughly. When I'm doing back-end development, I love having a front-end guy who can make it look pretty - I don't want to have to use time/energy up doing that when I'm concentrating on making a secure, fast, maintainable back-end.<p>However, there is a limit to this. A back-end guy should still have some idea what goes on front-end and vice-versa. So, the key is to be an expert at what you're best at, but not to be a dummy at what you're not as good at.<p>[On a side note, I don't see why specialization should create contempt. In my opinion, it should breed appreciation]",1352185037

Without liquidity of use any ratings system will just be so sparse as to be anecdotal.<p>I don't see a problem wit yelp, reading only a star rating isn't a good way to make it useful, you have to speed read and sample the reviews. At a glance I can tell a reviewer who's fake, or one of the many that just like to hear the sound of their own voice, or they are just an opinionated asshole. But when you speed read a few comments you can pick up general trends. For example if many reviewers all say a hotel was noisy there might be something in it. Ditto for amazon. The ""solution"" that some have tried is to rate the rating, then use a pagerank-link algorithm to module the effect any one rater on the rating. In other words, if many people who themselves have been rated at rating highly accurately, then my influence on a rating is higher.<p>The suggestions I have seen here (mainly collaborative filtering) may be of merit, if that's have foursquare plan to do it then with more of a representative sampling of users and maybe it will work well.

You had to pick image that would fit in the right bottom corner of (usually) 3x3 image grid. It was all about picking apart those objects and noticing how their elements change as you move from row to row and from column to column. Me being programmer given me some advantage I think because I perceived some transitions as bitwise operations and frame by frame animations.",1352181948

It's a fantastic city enveloped by the ocean and mountains, has world-class cuisine, and city planning that has a semblance of sanity to most observers.<p>Yet, the young brains are draining en masse for Montreal and Toronto (not to mention California). It doesn't help that Vancouver hasn't bothered to match the aforementioned cities' tax incentives for small and technology businesses (thus the brain drain). And, lately it seems that mainland Chinese are trading their yuan for Vancouver real estate, thus seriously inflating the bubble and pricing everyone who doesn't own an Android phone factory in Chengdu out entirely.<p>Singapore is increasingly being known as a haven for the borderless rich to park their jets and their cash, since the tax climate is the envy of most of the developed world. So, the same situation foments: You can't keep the Creative Class without giving them (<i>affordable</i>) space to live and work and play (which for that class is all the same!)",1352181939

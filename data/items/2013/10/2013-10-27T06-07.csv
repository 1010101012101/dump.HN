They hold the keys to the data and can charge customers for access to the firehose.<p>Your assumption is that the news consumption pattern ultimately dictates where the producers flock, which makes sense in the traditional journalistic business model.   In a model where individual users contribute, the key factor is which platform gives users an easy way to speak (and I would argue that twitter has done a decent job at reducing the tweet friction)",1382857175

6621089,comment,6619062,6620496,2,0,graue,,,"I&#x27;m not aware of a good reason to prefer ClojureScript+Node.js in general. Maybe if you wanted interop with a specific Node library, but otherwise, Clojure on the JVM will tend to have vastly better performance, and the tooling is better.<p>For example, until recently ClojureScript&#x27;s :keywords were just strings under the hood and it required a string compare to test equality. Apparently this is no longer the case due to this commit 2 months ago: <a href=""https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/commit/2cef52840fcd9d88f077d374cc81e50c7e645b9f"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/commit/2cef52840fcd...</a> but it shows you the kind of stuff you might run into. In a recent talk I saw by David Nolen, the lead maintainer of the ClojureScript compiler, he brought up multimethod dispatch as something that can still be as much as 100 times slower than the JVM.<p>As a tooling example, Clojure gives you helpful errors if you initialize records the wrong way:<p><pre><code>    user=> (defrecord Thing [foo bar])
    user.Thing
    user=> (Thing. 1 2)  ; correct usage
    #user.Thing{:foo 1, :bar 2}
    user=> (Thing. 1)    ; wrong number of fields
    
    CompilerException java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No matching ctor found for class user.Thing, compiling:(/tmp/form-init7089728177345913731.clj:1:1) 
    user=> (Thing 1 2)   ; forgetting the dot
    
    RuntimeException Expecting var, but Thing is mapped to class user.Thing  clojure.lang.Util.runtimeException (Util.java:219)
</code></pre>
That&#x27;s good! Especially if you&#x27;re new to the language. You see where you messed up right away.<p>But ClojureScript just silently gives you nils:<p><pre><code>    ClojureScript:cljs.user> (defrecord Thing [foo bar])
    cljs.user/Thing
    ClojureScript:cljs.user> (Thing. 1 2)  ; correct usage
    #cljs.user.Thing{:foo 1, :bar 2}
    ClojureScript:cljs.user> (Thing. 1)    ; wrong number of fields
    #cljs.user.Thing{:foo 1, :bar nil}
    ClojureScript:cljs.user> (Thing 1 2)   ; forgetting the dot
    nil
</code></pre>
This should be a bug report against the CLJS compiler (edit: now it is[1]), and it&#x27;s probably not that hard to fix. I could fix it. You could fix it. (The CLJS compiler is very approachable and needs contributors, by the way.) But, especially as a newbie, this kind of stuff can bite you.

Its current revenue growth is even faster than Google. That ensures itself as the biggest ecommerce platform for years to come. If it wants more profit, it can certainly do it. I believe Amazon will eventually automate most of its systems, like using robots instead of humans for warehouse, and gain significant profit margin. Chinese company Taobao (like eBay) provided free service for 5 years, and gained dominant market share. Now it is hugely profitable.<p>On the other hand, Jeff is likely more interested in just growing the business than counting profit dollars.",1382856652

It also provides a beautiful, useful admin UI (think activeadmin for rails).<p>It&#x27;s open source (MIT), and cool because...<p>* There isn&#x27;t really anything like this for node.js yet (that we&#x27;ve found). There are a so many great modules and you can plug in almost anything, but getting projects off the ground requires a lot of boilerplate compared to frameworks like rails or django.<p>* It makes sophisticated things trivial by providing drop-in patterns - like session management and auth, and clever fields for your models, e.g. location fields and image fields (which make for a better admin UI but don&#x27;t abstract too heavily the underlying data the fields represent).<p>* We&#x27;re trying to build an &quot;out of the box&quot; system that doesn&#x27;t keep you in the box. You can use what you like and swap out what you don&#x27;t. You can use Jade or Handlebars. Plug in any express middleware you like. Use the built in auth system or provide your own.<p>* It&#x27;s all based on the best practices my team have come up with in over a year of node.js web app development and we&#x27;re using it to power several commercial, production projects. So it&#x27;s got real-world usage and solves real problems.<p>* Quite a few people have said this is a gap in the node.js ecosystem, and ultimately if Keystone is just useful for us and a handful of others that&#x27;s fine, but it would be really exciting if we could start something that helps node.js grow or helps other web developers use the platform. Especially for projects where rapid development is important, and having a great admin UI available would be the difference between using node.js and not.<p>If you&#x27;re interested check out <a href=""http://keystonejs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://keystonejs.com</a>",1382855152

It&#x27;s possible that it&#x27;s already exploited independently.<p>2. Differentiating BIOS or EFI at that level is a semantics game. It&#x27;s firmware, and on x86 it&#x27;s traditionally called BIOS. There&#x27;s the API difference, but they serve approximately the same purpose.
Most &quot;BIOS&quot;es since 2009 are actually UEFI underneath, while some early UEFI implementations were 80% BIOS with just enough UEFI surface tacked on to boot Windows Server in UEFI mode.<p>3. It&#x27;s somewhat unlikely that Apple built some custom circuitry to run before the CPU gets its chance to run x86 instructions. Without Anchor Cove, the state of the art on x86 is that the firmware verifies itself by measuring into the TPM. Considerations of the usefulness of such an operation are left as exercise to the reader.<p>The &quot;SOS&quot; mentioned in the paper beep seems to be recoverable with a rescue CD (<a href=""https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2164874"" rel=""nofollow"">https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2164874</a>), so that sounds like a self-test of the firmware (with even enough support to load files from media, for which almost all hardware must be initialized).<p>The only way to make this remotely safe would be to lock down parts of the flash in hardware (like Chromebooks do), but I&#x27;m not sure Apple even considered that as a threat. The SOS thing is probably just a user-friendly way to cope with flash updates that went wrong.<p>That Black Hat paper stopped with SOS, and it seems like they didn&#x27;t even look how to circumvent that test.<p>4. (U)EFI runs whatever PE/TE binaries it gets presented. UEFI Secure Boot (not relevant for Macs) locks that down a bit, but in-flash binaries are typically exempt from signature tests (EDK2 allows to configure security levels for 4 source categories: IIRC Flash, Option ROMs, readonly media, readwrite media)<p>5. The Black Hat paper claims that UEFI Secure Boot and TPM somehow interact. They don&#x27;t. Secure Boot is specifically designed to work without a TPM.<p>Reading across the entire account (there&#x27;s more than just this post), it indeed sounds like science fiction and there are some wild suspicions, but it&#x27;s still just so plausible.",1382854836

Even then, there is no facility (which Deluge does provide) to click a torrent link in your local browser and have it initiate a download on your remote server-instance.<p>For a real barebones non-gui option, rtorrent tui client with tmux detachable text session is quite workable even though it too lacks the advanced features provided by Deluge.<p>EDIT:  Baretorrent does offer an extension that allows you to remotely add a torrent, but doesn&#x27;t give you a full local client as Deluge does.",1382853628

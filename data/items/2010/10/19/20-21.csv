But honestly I'd say each generation was better off than its previous one. So I have a cell phone. My cell phone probably has more computing power than the universities whole computer lab that my dad attended? And that my grandfather while my age didn't use a computer. I'd say being able to access all the worlds information among thousands of other things that have been made better makes mine and your generation better off. Gratitude is important too.",1287521963

If this cost is low, I agree with others that #1 is the best option.<p>See, I tried option #1, and my product, well, it costs me quite a lot.  I found that very few of my first month free trials converted to paying customers, they all used bandwidth like crazy, and looking, I believe that the majority of signups used fake names.  At the end of this trial period I was left with a rather hefty bandwidth bill and a whole lot of now empty servers.   it was pretty miserable.  I don't think my actual paying customer signup rate was any different than it was the month before.<p>so for my business, #2 is the only way to go.<p>On the other hand, if the cost to you of hosting these free customers is almost nothing, and you are okay with the fact that your conversion rate will probably not be as great as you think it will be and that many of your customers will likely sign up with fake names just to try it out,  option #1 might be just fine for you.",1287521859

Google's exploitation of ""open"" has been disingenuous at best. When you try to square their high ideals against reality, you end up in an uncomfortable spot.<p>The fact is, Android's openness <i>does not make it to the end user</i>. Its openness is exploited for the benefit of the carriers to load branded crapware onto the device, disable specific features and other nonsense. Don't like this? Too bad. Android's openness <i>isn't for you</i>, now that carriers and manufacturers are getting wise to your hackery tricks. They're going to make it as hard as possible to root your Android phone. So you'd better get used to that awesome Blockbuster app.<p>In the end, iOS and Android devices are on even footing in terms of big companies trying to control the final experience.<p>Which leaves us with one thing: motivations.<p>Carrier motivations are to <i>fuck you out of as much money as humanly possible in the short term</i>. In the past that meant disabling device features to force you into their ecosystem – I'm sure this will continue one way or another. They'll load branded garbage onto your device. They'll put specific marketplaces on your device, and maybe even remove Google's if they want to. Their manufacturing partners will happily conspire with them on this, including the firmware fuse that prevents rooting your device so you can make it somewhat clean again.<p>Apple is no less ruthless with its control, but it exercises it for a different purpose: To deliver the most integrated, user-friendly, clean experience possible. (edit: and so, Apple's play is the converse: to maximize your cheerful purchases of Apple gear in the <i>long term</i> – thanks, matwood)<p>If you're a carrier, Android's openness makes it much more valuable than iOS in the short term. In that, Google's piety will ring true. If you're an end user, the net gain of that openness is zero, and at times it's even a loss.<p>I trust Apple infinitely more than I trust the carriers to make something I'll enjoy using. And that's the key to understand. With Apple, what I buy will always be clean. I'll always instantly understand the tradeoffs. With Android, it's going to be a gamble. How hard has my carrier boned this device? I'll have to research if I'm a nerd or be surprised if I'm everyone else. And there goes the power of Android as a brand.<p>Android is no longer Google. Android <i>is</i> the carriers.<p>When was the last time you heard someone write <i>those</i> guys a love letter?",1287521571

You can't say ""Give me any programming task and I'll pick it up"".<p>Speak for yourself.  I learned AutoLisp with one bit of sample code someone left behind and a bit of Googling in about a week, starting from zero.  Nobody else where I worked knows it at all.  But from that, I coded a full set of functions that did everything we need.<p>I reverse-engineered the semantics of some crazy internal scripting language to some of our industrial machines.  Nobody bothered to document that thing at all and it was custom to my employer.<p>I learned to use a different testing tool from nothing more than a bit of sample code and being told that it was based on VBS.  I then improved the code I was given.<p>Some of us really can figure out the semantics of something just from reading a few examples.  This also works with foreign languages.  Particularly if I can get parallel translations (e.g. subtitles), I can start working backwards to extract meaning and solve for unknown words.<p>In short, you'd be surprised about how quickly we can figure out things, especially if we've seen something like it before.  Sure, there are pitfalls, but anywhere where you have nice syntax aware IDEs and whatnot, it's not nearly as much of a barrier as you seem to think.<p>The more languages you've used, the easier it all is.

What's a happens-before relationship and how is it relevant to those keywords? What's the transient modifier do?<p>>I didn't claim to be a Java guru. Very few Java programmers actually need to know the answers to those questions in day-to-day programming; I could probably (if asked to, which I'm not, thankfully) write thousands or tens of thousands of lines of Java without ever needing to know the answer to those.<p>You're wrong, and this proves the point. This isn't 'guru' level, the workings of volatile and synchronized is even on the basic SCJP test. This may not come up in your domain, but if the project deals with threading, an experienced dev will be more productive than you right off the bat, after two weeks, and probably after a year.<p>In fact, threading is pretty tricky, so it's likely you will be counter-productive to the team until you've made all the Java threading mistakes you need to make in order to understand why your code is bad.

Fastforward to now, I've been in my current technology position for a year-and-a-half and the only time I heard feedback for my work was when a promotion came. I recently took on some telecommute contract work saving a product from failure and I receieved quite a bit of positive feedback (phone have something to do with it?).<p>So yeah, sounds about right. I would attribute it to a lot of people in leadership positions not really having training as to the processes of actual leading people. They may know how to make a phenominal gantt chart, but most of all flounder when it comes to maintaining interpersonal relationships.<p>The bottom line is that you have direct influence into a persons attitude, good or bad. If you completely lash out against somebody, that will produce negative results. If you praise and talk about what you liked about something, that will be a motivational nudge. Find a good middle ground where you can provide feedback both good/bad for somebody. Feedback is hugely important otherwise the person is just lost/assuming their own way.",1287519018

Just look at Chrome, it's become the poster child for how to do a web browser right. They are on version 6 (release) and 7 (development) and no-one would even know. You install Chrome and THAT'S IT. There's no ""upgrading"" there's no worrying about supporting old versions, you ALWAYS have the most up-to-date version and if it works on Chrome for you it will work for everyone else.<p>Even Firefox and Safari get this wrong. Does it work on FF3? What about FF2 or (god forbid) FF1? Safari 4? 5?<p>IE has taken this to the far, far extreme. Years between product releases, and nothing but security fixes between that. No features, no polishing, nothing.<p>This article is good but the conclusion is wrong. As long as Microsoft continues to do this ""release a browser version every 3-4 years"" us web developers will have to deal with this hell. I now refuse to support IE 6 in anything I do, and I'm very VERY close to adding 7 to that list, but 50% of our users still use 7!!!<p>10 years from now, we will still have to support the god awful mess that is IE 8! And IE 9 will be the same thing 5 years down the road as Webkit and Firefox push the boundary of what's possible in web development.

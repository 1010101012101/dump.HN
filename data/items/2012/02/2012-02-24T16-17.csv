3629813,comment,3629570,3629766,11,0,antirez,,,"Every command blocks every other command in Redis, because Redis is single threaded. However the implementation of scripting in Redis does a good use of Lua, so a command implemented in Lua does not run too much slower than a command implemented in C, for simple tasks (since we use a single Lua interpreter, and cache compiled functions). So this is an example of what you can do with Lua scripting:<p><pre><code>    redis 127.0.0.1:6379> set foo '{""b"":20,""a"":10}'
    OK
</code></pre>
The user wants to increment the value of ""b"" with a single query to Redis in an atomic way:<p><pre><code>    $ cat /tmp/script.lua
    obj = cjson.decode(redis.call(""GET"",KEYS[1]))
    obj.b = obj.b + 1
    redis.call(""SET"",KEYS[1],cjson.encode(obj))
    return obj.b
    $ redis-cli --eval /tmp/script.lua foo
    (integer) 21
    $ redis-cli --eval /tmp/script.lua foo
    (integer) 22
    $ redis-cli GET foo
    ""{\"a\":10,\"b\":22}""
</code></pre>
No back and forth from client to server, no locking needed. Basically you can implement your specialized, atomic commands, in Lua.",1330102353

Specifically, if I have some new web task, what I care about is that there is some library/plug-in/service that exists to perform that task (e.g., user auth, Facebook API, exception logging, Heroku, resque, state machines), that the library/plug-in/service is mature enough that I can pretend it works, and that it has enough of a community around it that it won't break in the future.<p>Is there some comprehensive list of use cases, plug-ins/libraries/services, and relative maturity of those plug-ins/libraries/services across web frameworks?  For example, the maturity of the various ORMs across frameworks, or the various testing tools, or the various Facebook libraries.  It would be great to see it change over time, and to know when to jump ship to the next flawed language/runtime that has good plug-ins/libraries/services.",1330101905

   jacks) to get the benefits, just walking around is sufficient.

3629704,comment,3629151,3629481,11,0,jerf,,,"In context, that is not true. In the Star Wars universe, planets have planetary shields, which are extremely powerful and able to take a lot of abuse. An asteroid strike is <i>wildly</i> less powerful than what the Death Star can inflict on a planet; ten+ of orders of magnitude, and I mean that fully literally. An asteroid strike may be enough to wipe out an unprotected civilization, but it hardly affects the planet underneath. The Death Star delivered enough energy to the target to undo the entire binding energy of the planet and completely disassemble it, <i>and</i> do it quite quickly. That's the difference between a very large nuclear strike, let's say 10^20J for roundness [1], vs. the binding energy of a planet, call it 10^32J, plus a great deal extra kinetic energy to blow the planet apart at a sufficient speed to satisfy Hollywood's need for instant spectacle.<p>For that matter, the canon specifications for a single turbolaser strike are on the order of what we'd associate with a very large nuclear event; if a planetary shield can withstand sustained bombardment by multiple Star Destroyers, moving an asteroid around isn't going to matter.<p>(One could discuss accelerating an asteroid to kinetic kill speeds, but if you <i>can</i> build a Death Star, it is certainly a lot easier to control and deploy.)<p>In real life, of course, with no plausible mechanism for anything like ""shields"" to exist, you are of course correct. If you're patient one can completely destroy all life on a planet with distressingly small investments of energy not entirely dissimilar to what we could produce today.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_equivalent"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_equivalent</a> , I'm spec'ing out a ~20 gigaton strike here.<p>[2]: <a href=""http://scienceblogs.com/builtonfacts/2009/02/the_physics_of_the_death_star.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scienceblogs.com/builtonfacts/2009/02/the_physics_of_...</a>",1330101000

3629684,comment,3626880,3629564,2,0,figglesonrails,,,"Yeah, there will always be pirates. I don't think you can fairly say ""massively pirated"" because you don't actually have numbers to back that statement, just like I couldn't say that ""most people get the game through Steam"". However, I would speculate that using Steam as a distribution channel has helped the author more than whatever online pay-then-download mechanism he would ever come up with. I would further speculate that using a common distribution channel like Steam increases the audience and simply by holding piracy constant and increasing paying user numbers, the percent of piracy would decrease. I'm sure ""holding piracy constant"" is a bit of stretch, but I wouldn't imagine it would increase as massively relative to the number of paying customers. Again, I don't have numbers, so this is just speculation, but I think they are reasonably sound.<p>If you look at TPB and say ""look at all the piracy!"" -- well, you won't find much else, it's TPB. I wouldn't assume then that it's pirates all the way down.<p>The comparison to NewEgg.com is pretty poor. What you're describing is theft of physical property. There is always a real loss of money (not potential money/profit, but honest-to-God money and resources). Software/music/digital art doesn't have this property. There is no loss of real money/resources used to make the copy. This fact actually DOES make all of the difference. If <i>everyone</i> pirated a game, it would not drain the physical assets of the company that produced it for each copy made. Yes, it's still theft, but it is a lot more justifiable (and sustainable, for better or for worse) than robbing a warehouse.<p>I pirated a copy of Windows XP 64-bit Edition (for Itanium CPUs). You know why? Because Microsoft won't sell it to me, nor will anyone else. I literally had no other choice. In America, we're blessed with being first, but I have it's really annoying to try to get around bans/censorships/date shifts that make something unavailable in your region. When you have no other choice, it's a lot easier to say ""eh, screw it, they won't take my money, fine.""<p>I'm sure plenty of people pirate because they hate paying, but I'd be interested in a large-scale survey as to the reasons. I'm sure they vary by income level, technical knowledge, and region. That would be a lot more useful than pidgeon-holing all pirates as cheap bastards when quite frankly, none of us know the results of such a survey.<p>---<p>Pirates will be pirates, yes, but the goal isn't (and never will be) to eliminate all pirates, it is minimize losses (and therefore, maximize revenue). Right now providing really good service, extra value (steam features), and low pricing is the best way we know to coaxing users to voluntarily part with their money without the flak of ""WE HATE DRM"" that is common with overly draconian measures.

Right now, we have (admittedly) very crude technology that lets us probe the brain and tell with a reasonable certainty if someone is lying. It may be possible to produce a machine in the future that can analyze the mind well enough that it will be possible to tell what words a person is thinking. If that's the case, would it be legal to require the accused to be subject to such a machine to reveal their password? If that is the case, will the government need the accused's testimony at all?<p>Further along that line of thinking, it may become possible to change what a person is thinking by suppressing or exciting different regions within the brain. At that point, is punishment still legal if the government can simply change what a perpetrator thinks? For example, changing a con artist's mind so they no longer think of using their persuasive skills to con people. On the surface, isn't that what prison and the penal code is about anyway?<p>I believe we need to concern ourselves greatly about this, because we are now on the cusp of technologies that will make building brain-computer interfaces not only possible, but possibly simple. This will be an amazing boon to the elderly, others who have degenerative problems, and probably everyone else. At that point however, where does an individual's mind stop, and legally-accessible file storage begin?<p>I believe the slippery slope of both these arguments starts at this point, deciding where the demarcation of self-incrimination is.

And they felt more responsive because of it.<p>I think it's a fair trade-off to optimize for your user experience instead of the machines. Honestly, Google is not going to ding you for this, and as long as you've got an exception notifier going and are on top of it, there's no reason it should become a real problem for <i>most</i> sites. Being able to make a choice per-request/action would be nice of course.<p>> My assumption was merely that you should measure it before you start worrying about it.<p>I have. I wrote the original versions of DataMapper (which BTW, <i>was</i> a DataMapper despite popular belief. The methods hanging off the models were just helpers to the Session originally but it lost it's way at some point).<p>I can tell you for a fact that it's slow. Sure, go ahead and measure it. I'm not saying that's <i>bad</i>. Just apply some judgement to the situation. Are you grabbing a lot of rows? Are you performing lots of individual selects? (Or using AR+include options where each include is effectively the same as another query?)<p>You can feel free to write slow code until it becomes a problem, or you can develop some good practices <i>up front</i>, before ever needing to profile, to prevent much of that. Disregard for reasonable optimization and forming good habits based on generalized rules of thumb is just as evil as premature optimization. We're not talking about twiddling minutia here.<p>> it would be silly to create objects for all of them<p>Why?<p>Hibernate can do it. NHibernate can do it. LLBLGenPro could do it (probably the closest to Ruby's Sequel, but here it was a non-issue even with Models). Simpler AR style O/RM's like Wilson O/R Mapper could do it.<p>Given that AR doesn't really provide a decent DAL tool that I can recall, I'd say it's perfectly reasonable to expect that the ""Full Stack"" framework you're using covers the bases without nasty surprises. Especially if you've come from a background where millions of method-dispatch events imposes nanoseconds of overhead instead of milliseconds of overhead (Java and .NET at least).<p>I don't think it's at all ""silly"".

3629581,comment,3628942,3628942,16,0,exch,,,"I've been going through many, many programming languages over the years. Many of them I can't even remember anymore. Some of them I have stuck with for a long time, simply because they were most suitable for the kind of problems I was trying to solve at the time.<p>Originally I was very much in favour of finding the 'One language to rule them all'. Being able to do everything with a single language seemed like a no-brainer. But what all these years of try-outs have taught me is that such a language simply does not exist. And I will go one step further to state that they shouldn't exist.<p>The problem with every single language which tries to be good at everything, is that it inevitably ends up being mediocre at best and a major clusterf*ck at worst (I am looking at you, c++). Yes, it may be able to solve every problem out there, but not at significant cost to the programmer and development cycle. Inordinate amounts of complexity make the whole business of writing a useful application nothing short of a nightmare. A nightmare that you just do not have to put up with.<p>Lately I have come to realize that the quest for that one language has been a monumental waste of time. I have since settled on a DSL strategy. Pick a problem and then find a language/toolset that is uniquely suited to solve that problem in the most efficient way possible. Not only does this make the development cycle less painful, it teaches you a great deal about the problem domain your are facing, without having to deal with all the superfluous nonsense that a general-purpose language would impose upon you.<p>By adhering to this strategy, the obvious side effect is that there is no such thing as a favourite programming language. It all depends on what you are trying to accomplish. For the time being, my focus lies on Go. Not because I think it's the best thing that ever happened to the world, but because it solves /my problems/ elegantly and (almost) painlessly. This doesn't mean I will be using it for everything though. I would not even consider using it for something UX/UI related. For the simple reason that it is definitely not the ideal tool for this job.

2163371,comment,2162801,2162801,0,0,grellas,,,"A few observations:<p>1. A convertible note, however favorable its terms, is still fundamentally a <i>loan</i>. This means it will have a due date at which the holder may demand payment unless the amounts due have been converted into equity before then.<p>2. Item 1 in turn means that there will be no coasting for the YC companies upon receipt of this money or even necessarily a break from the pressure of fundraising. Why? Because the investment is not from a relative who is looking to get a high-interest-rate return on his investment but rather from a venture investor who fully expects that the company will make a good-faith effort to raise funds as appropriate to meet the minimum funding threshold at which his note will convert into equity. That means there will be considerable pressure to do a Series A round within the term of a typical note of this type, which means within the first 9 months.<p>3. What this money does then, in my view, is strengthen the negotiating leverage of the YC companies in terms of getting further bridge funding to carry them out to Series A. They won't need to worry about survival money during their first steps and they can in turn be more selective about whom to talk to and what terms to consider in taking further bridge money for their early build-out.<p>4. The terms of these notes will undoubtedly have provisions covering what happens if the startup is acquired before a triggering event for the note conversion. Those terms might vary widely but my guess is that they will be such as to motivate the founders to push for funding so as to effect a conversion. There is nothing wrong with an investor building in reasonable safeguards to make sure he doesn't get abused and the safeguards here might be such as to make it unattractive for the founders to exit via M&A prior to conversion, which again means that there will be great pressure to get the larger funding.<p>The biggest impact here will be on those investors competing for early deal-flow and on what should be a broader pool of applicants who can now seek to go the YC direction. I doubt that it will relieve the fund-raising rigors of the YC companies themselves very much, if at all.",1296511055

I'm not saying I agree with what the NoSQL folks are saying, or their justifications. Let's be honest: there's a prevalent sentiment that relational SQL based databases do not scale, and even further, that they somehow cannot scale. That's just not true.<p>I saw a video the other day of some guy at Google giving a talk about the database behind the app engine. At one point someone in the audience asked about scale and SQL. His response was ""Well, how well does SQL scale?"" Everyone in the room laughed.",1296510283

Since they greedily kicked NVidia out of the chipset business, they've done a great job of proving how bad a decision that was for consumers:<p>Intel's integrated graphics performance is still pathetic, though it has at least gotten up to the lowest level of performance that AMD and NVidia have been willing to put on the market. This has been a real sore point for anybody trying to make a good low-power notebook (ie. Apple).<p>Intel's chipsets have been slow to pick up new features, with this latest generation being the first to offer 6Gbps SATA (which is necessary to get full performance out of last year's high-end SSDs), albeit only two ports at that speed, and they won't be adding USB3 support until their next micro-architecture revision, which is at least a year away.<p>To top it off, the latest generation of chipsets exhibit one of the most disgusting segmentation strategies Intel has ever tried: the Sandy Bridge CPUs have on-die graphics chips that are an unavoidable cost for consumers, and their performance is insufficient for even casual gaming. Their redeeming quality is the top-notch transcoding engine, which offers higher performance than any CPU or discrete GPU can manage. However, in order to use it, you have to use the integrated graphics. There's a software hack that will let you use it with discrete GPUs, but only on the multimedia-oriented H67 chipset. The performance-oriented P67 chipset (which is the only one to support multiple discrete graphics cards or overclocking) completely disables the integrated graphics. If you want to build a gaming system, Intel forces you to pay for a couple hundred million extra transistors on your CPU that you won't be allowed to use.<p>After all that, it's hard to feel sorry for Intel's biggest CPU architecture launch ever being ruined like this. If they still had a third-party chipset partner, then they would at least be able to sell <i>some</i> Sandy Bridge processors in February.",1296509804

The Lighthouse tracker is a bit intimidating without anyone to point you in the right direction. If there was a place I could go and find small ""get your feet wet"" tasks to then get to a point where I can rewrite major components, then I would have started contributing much earlier in my career.  The way I got into doing things for Rubygems was via a friend: I got a direct request to help with a new project for Rubygems. I didn't know what needed to be done so I never helped out previously.<p>Githacking wants to be what that friend was for me: a way to contribute with no friction on either the maintainer's side or the contributer's side and a clear starting place for getting involved in a new project.<p>Taking that a step further: a major part of the platform will be feature requests from companies that depend on the project, not unlike the bounties large open source projects put out from time to time on a bug or feature.

The site makes $10 million/year.  \n2. He has three employees, all customer service.  He does everything else.\n3. He pays himself $5 million/year.<p>This quote is particularly telling: ""At other sites, when one thing goes slightly wrong, the reaction is to buy more servers or hire a Ph.D.,"" he says. ""It's almost unbelievable -- it's like people are trying to justify their jobs by spending money. This isn't rocket science.""",1296507831

I think it comes down to a decision of whether you want to sacrifice employment productivity over your own enrichment (which might never even pay off)",1296507683

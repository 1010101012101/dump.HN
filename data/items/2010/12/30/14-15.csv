One of my favorite questions to ask when I interview people is ""what would you do with $10 million cash right now?"" It's a question that exposes a few key things about the person's set of values. There is no right answer but if the candidate starts off by telling me what clothes or car they would buy, they are the wrong person. I want someone who would start something in the same field they are interviewing for and a series of follow up ""why"" questions usually puts us on an interesting path.",1293721108

Careful skepticism is favored over blind boosterism as well.</i><p>The comment I was replying to was neither a refined critique nor an example of careful skepticism. Whether you agree with Sebastian isn't the point at all; comments like the one that zuckerborg made do absolutely nothing to raise the level of discourse. Which is probably why the HN guidelines are clear on this point:<p><i>Be civil. Don't say things you wouldn't say in a face to face conversation.<p>When disagreeing, please reply to the argument instead of calling names. E.g. ""That is an idiotic thing to say; 1 + 1 is 2, not 3"" can be shortened to ""1 + 1 is 2, not 3.""</i><p>PG has said elsewhere that one kind of bad comment he tries to keep a lid on is meanness.

This means if all your closest friends are losers you'll likely be a loser too.  It's not mean or egotistical to recognize that people you spend the most time with do in fact influence you.<p>It's also a good thing to remove friends that are holding you back.  Sports stars probably need to do more of this.  They become famous, make a lot of money, but keep hanging out with the friends from 'the hood' and end up all sorts of trouble.<p>Another good example are people who lose a lot of weight.

It's interesting with all the language PC in the US (e.g. a lot of articles and books on hackers will use the pronoun <i>she</i> although women in this field, by everybody's admission, are rare) Germans are quite OK with the fact that the word for hacker is masculine. Indeed I think a lot of people would be surprised if there was a movement to change it to <i>die Hacker</i>. There's, of course, <i>die Hackerin</i> but a lot of people here would object to that even more, since it's derived from a ""male"" form of the word.<p>Similar situation in French, although, as it predicated by their angst over their language, things are not so easy (<a href=""http://www.nakedtranslations.com/en/2004/hacker"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nakedtranslations.com/en/2004/hacker</a>).<p>On a different note, this word for witch is why those weird signs are called ""Hex Signs"" (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_sign"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_sign</a>).",1293718842

It's a significant contributor to our rising medical costs.<p>Supply of medical services = (# of doctors) x (average hours worked). The # of doctors is basically fixed (all medical school slots are filled, and there is no movement to build more), which means part time doctors reduce the supply of medical services. Net result: rising prices (note: not the only cause of this), fewer people being treated.<p>Hopefully things work out better for the dutch than for us.<p>I think China has a very forward thinking idea on this: if training slots are limited by government fiat, raise standards for women relative to men (since society will get fewer hours of output from a given woman, she will need a higher productivity to compensate).",1293718767

But queries like that should show up in reporting, not in serving live web pages.<p>That said, if you're selecting more than 5% or so of the rows in a table, you're probably better off not using an index.<p>Another random tip.  There is a world of difference between putting indexes on 2 fields, and putting a composite index on 2 fields.  If you have restrictive conditions on 2 fields, MySQL has to work with the entire list of rows that match at least one of those conditions.  (I don't know whether MySQL has the trick of joining indexes together before looking at rows, but even if it does it has to work with a list of rows matching the condition.)  By contrast with a composite index MySQL can only look at rows that match <i>both</i> conditions.  Much more efficient.",1293718437

I told 3 of them I was not willing to participate to this anymore. The 5th one did not care, we always got along well. In fact, he was participating in those juvenile activities less and less too and developed his own branch of friends.<p>Two really take it badly, as if it was some kind of betrayal. They adopted a dogma attitude. I knew them since I was 5 years old. They reacted emotionally and would not address the maturity issues. It was a one-sided conversation. They carried on their juveniles games until their early thirties.<p>I was even replaced by another guy to fill the gap. When #4 got married, my replacement was invited to the full ceremony and I was only invited to the cocktail. He knew my replacement for a couple of years then, I knew him for more than 20. It was a bit of a shock, but not a real surprise.<p>I knew they were acting juvenile beyond their 20's to cover for their insecurities and lack of will to become mature and responsible.

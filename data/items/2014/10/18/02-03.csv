You need to handle this relationship carefully.<p>I am 40 and for that reason I am biased with regards to email as I grew up with it. Having said that. I can&#x27;t find a much better tool than email to build a social project around.<p>When I started weekendhacker.net I got 3000 signups in a week. First 10 newsletters with around 100 projects I hand wrote but it allowed me to try out and see if there was something of value without spending too much on servers etc (WH is non-profit).<p>Now I am at 8000 members and with 500 projects under the wing. I have more automation now but it&#x27;s still centered around the newsletter and it still feels like a community.<p>Starting a business around emails is the quickest and most telling way of starting a business next to people actually paying you.",1413601058

Firefox, for example, will wait up to 10 seconds for an OCSP response (<a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:ImprovingRevocation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:ImprovingRevocation</a>)<p>That article cites Adam Langley - a respected engineer at Google who has worked on Chrome and parts of Go. Chrome is wildly lax with certificate revocation. Don&#x27;t believe me? Browse to <a href=""https://revoked.grc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://revoked.grc.com</a> from Chrome. It is true that if someone can MITM they can block CRL/OCSP requests...but browsers (including Chrome) made the choice of &#x27;soft-failing&#x27; and thus making it an attack vector. OCSP stapling and the proposed &quot;OCSP Must-Staple&quot; (<a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hallambaker-muststaple-00"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hallambaker-muststaple-00</a>) solve this problem. With all due respect to Adam, it seems a little peculiar to say revocation checks don&#x27;t work when they&#x27;re broken by design in the browser he worked/works on.<p>Chrome is the only browser that skips revocation checks for DV certificates but it still does OCSP for EV certs. Chrome has the concept of CRLsets - but these have been shown to only capture a very small portion (<1%) of revoked certificates.<p>Firefox has the option to hard-fail if the OCSP request isn&#x27;t verified.  This should be the default behavior, but the fear is that too few people understand this and would migrate to another browser if SSL secured sites randomly failed to load sometimes. Note: this is vastly preferable, in my opinion, to loading a site with a certificate of unknown status.",1413600898

Today, at 49, I am fluently and idiomatically bilingual in English, French, and various idiomatic variations on both common to the provinces in which I&#x27;ve lived (I can switch from stock-standard English to various idiomatic dialects and accents, as many of you can, e.g., formal English Vs the street or town English you spoke growing up, from those used here in Ontario to lilting dialects and accents of Nova Scotia; I can do the same with a few Quebec Joual dialects.)<p>With a couple of days in Paris, I am taken for a native. Same thing in New Orleans or Chicago (I have to be very careful about not drifting into local accents, I just sort of go there.)<p>So it is possible to be perfectly bilingual - but it requires early exposure to the second language and an ear (which can be developed - you have to stop listening to specifics, to particulars, and listen holistically, letting the language flow over you so that you understand the intent without understanding individual words - practice that for a while, and the words come).<p>I also speak passable remedial Spanish and have learned and forgotten a whole lot of Turkish, Arabic, German, and Greek.<p>After a while, your inner voice switches to non-linguistic (which I think might mean it returns to what it was before you had language, i.e., as a child). I used to think mostly in English, but nowadays I think in, well, viscera. I then have to find the words that most closely match the viscera. For simple things, that happens quickly. For complex things or subtle differences, it can take time, during which I sputter.<p>About 6 months ago I ask a friend&#x27;s daughter whether this had happened to her yet (she was raised in French, added English much later, then some Spanish, and finally did intensive German prior to heading o&#x27;er the pond for her M.Eng).<p>Her eyes went wide and she shrieked &quot;OUI! OUI! Exactement!&quot; She turned to her mother: &quot;M&#x27;man! Il comprend exactement qu&#x27;est ce qui m&#x27;arrive!&quot;<p>(Yes, yes, exactly! Mom! He understands exactly what is happening to me!)<p>She&#x27;d been going through the same thing and didn&#x27;t know it had ever happened to anyone else.<p>It&#x27;s a truly strange thing, mind blowing - and mind expanding.<p>Sometimes, I can sort of disconnect from language. It frees my mind in a most powerful way. It&#x27;s tricky to get there, though, and sometimes even harder to get back.",1413599294

Happens to me a lot in German where I don&#x27;t have a vocabulary as wide as Spanish on English that the brain will have to build a sentence maybe 30% longer but it will eventually bring out something that does the job. When I&#x27;m coding I just know the program needs to do certain thing. Python is very straightforward while with PHP usually I need to build some auxiliary function (same as German , not that the word doesn&#x27;t exist but I don&#x27;t have it in my Head at the moment). Also, very obscure concepts like &quot;Dativ&quot; conjugation do exist in spanish but since it looks the same as &quot;Genitiv&quot; and &quot;Akkusativ&quot; , nobody pays to much attention. However when you are speaking German you&#x27;d better understand that as you need them to correctly build a sentence of the fly. An example analogy with coding would be generic data structures like arrays in PHP but in Python are more rich like Lists, Dictionaries and Tuples(IMHO)",1413599163

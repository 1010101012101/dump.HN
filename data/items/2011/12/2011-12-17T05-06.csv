If some of you are aware of mixed culture of urban and rural india in towns and small cities, then it's a norm for a taxi/auto [cab] drivers to make calls for their customers (I am not talking about professional cab companies, who provide cellphones to their drivers).
Vegetable salespersons, electricians, plumbers .. there is a long list of these, it was an era when they were used to miss calls, but they will rather make a call today.
However my take on this post is based on what I am observing in my surroundings, may be statistics say something else.
The other reason of making a proper call can go like this : some telephone companies in India sell their sim 'free' and you get starting free talk time of 30/50/100 INR, these sim are sold in wholesale(obviously targeted for conversions ), if not free then they are there for nominal charges. Barrier to entry for making a call is very less, it is used for free talk time,internet(with indian speed) then some trash the sim, some of them don't mind making a local call on tariff like 1 paisa per second . [ 1 Rupees = 100 Paisa ]",1324101571

For example, if the characters are designed to appeal to women, you can pretty much guarantee that they will not look like they have had basketballs implanted in their chests.<p>Likewise, massive male characters built out of a mountain of muscle are designed primarily to appeal to male power fantasies. Relatively few women will find this especially attractive, and male characters designed to appeal to more (straight) women would be built more along the lines of Ryan Gosling or Ryan Reynolds.",1324101257

As you say, both Groupon and Zynga will likely continue as profitable businesses for the foreseeable future.

One of these traumas is borne of the experience of being not merely rejected, but openly mocked by girls during the most critical time in a young man's life when he is supposed to develop his sense of social status and sexuality.

""If amoebae occur in well-mixed cosmopolitan groups, then cheaters will always be able to thrive by freeloading on their cooperative neighbors. But if groups derive from a single cell, cheaters will usually occur in all-cheater groups and will have no cooperators to exploit.<p>The only exceptions are brand new cheater mutants in all-cooperator groups, and these could pose a problem if the mutation rate is high enough and there are many cells in the group to mutate. In fact, the scientists calculated just how many times amoebae that arose from a single cell can safely divide before cooperation degenerates into a free-for-all.<p>The answer turns out to be 100 generations or more.<p>So population bottlenecks that kill off diversity and restart the population from a single cell are powerful stabilizers of cellular cooperation, the scientists conclude.<p>In other words our liver, blood and bone cells help our eggs and sperm pass on their genes because we passed through a single-cell bottleneck at the moment of conception.""<p>If anything, I felt this section was /strongly/ hinting at cancer in a group of cells.

Women:  Sexy.<p>Okay, no arguments there.  But what does this difference in portrayal of the two sexes really mean?  However much some might believe otherwise, humans are hard-wired by evolution to have gender roles.  Homo sapiens has been around for roughly a hundred thousand years.  Our species evolved from older hunter-gatherer species and has existed for almost its entire history as hunter-gatherers.  What little we know about hunter-gatherer societies suggest that they were relatively egalitarian, but with definite gender roles.<p>Men: expendable risk takers.  If half the men in a hunter-gatherer band are wiped out by a mammoth hunt gone wrong, the next generation can still be just as large, only with slightly less genetic diversity.  So what makes a mammoth hunter popular with the ladies?  Well, he has to look like he's going to be one of the guys who will actually come back.  i.e. A badass.<p>Women:  non-expendible reproducers.  No matter how many men are around, the number of women who successfully bear children are what defines the reproductive success of a band.  If you're a man, you don't want the woman who goes out mammoth hunting with the guys, you want the woman who picks berries (gathering was probably even more vital to a band's survival than hunting!) and who has hips made for making babies.<p>In this light, what we might really be seeing in geek media is portrayals of both males and females that cater to our perception of desirability to the opposite sex.  Powerful, serious, badass men are desirable to women, so they are what we see in comics.  The same goes for sexy, fertile, women.  Men and women are being portrayed differently because different things set them apart as elite or superior to others of their gender, thanks to our hunter-gatherer wiring.<p>If this interpretation is correct, then media that portrays men as badass and woman as sexy isn't necessarily showing evidence of pandering to males.  It may simply be reflecting evolutionary gender roles.  It may be that this is one thing males should stop all the self-flagellation over.",1324099891

I've been in the gaming industry for a while, and I've probably passed my 10,000 hours of MMO development/management. Give most gaming girls a choice, and they will CHOOSE to dress their characters in slutty--or as they call it, ""sexy cute""--clothing. Can you almost see most of their legs? Yes. Should their nipples probably slip out once in a while, if there was a realistic physics engine? Yes.<p>Do they care? No. Just as I would not like to play a male character whose genitals are almost falling out, females would not like to (in general) play female characters who are covered by obstructive and unattractive clothing. Why do my friends adorn themselves in dresses that barely cover their underwear when they go to clubs? I used to think it was because they wanted to attract males, and while that may sometimes be the case, many of them have loyal boyfriends and won't even dance with other guys.<p>Want to know the real reason, why there are so few girls in gaming? Well, I don't know - though here's one (partial) guess:<p>Most ""nerds/geeks"" are disgusting. I have a <i>terrible</i> sense of smell, and sometimes I'm forced to recoil from my more nerdy peers. If everyone took the time to shower daily, use proper body wash, shampoo (and watch out of dandruff) and condition separately, exfoliate, and shave, I'd bet way more women will enter the gaming phenomenon.<p>Remember - gaming isn't always a solo affair. Much of the time, directly or indirectly, it's a social activity.",1324098190

3363444,comment,3363259,3363259,64,0,davidhansen,,,"I'm not sure why the author of this article somehow thinks that geeks deny the existence of sexism in geek culture.  The reality is that it's widely known and accepted.  If the author wants to find something to rail against, he should have chosen the fact that <i>everybody knows, but nobody cares</i>.<p>I'm not going to defend the treatment of women in geek culture, as much of it is indefensible.  but it seems that few people bring up one of the most important factors in its existence, one which has nothing at all to do with objectification.  It has more to do with envy, anger, and an amazing ability to hold a grudge.<p>Many HN readers are from a younger generation than myself.  Many of you grew up always equating geek with ""cool"", and have no conception of what it would be like to be treated as nearly subhuman for liking computers.  Some of us, however, remember the torment, the humiliation, the violence, the scorn and the ostracism of finding science, electronics, and computers fascinating.  There was, indeed, such a time.  Many nerds who endured poor treatment at the hands of their peers developed deep emotional traumas that, to this day, exist to some extent or another.  One of these traumas is borne of the experience of being not merely rejected, but openly mocked by girls during the most critical time in a young man's life when he is supposed to develop his sense of social status and sexuality.  Frustration and humiliation is quick to turn to anger, and from anger, a deep rooted misogyny.<p>The result of this kind of upbringing is often a socially stunted man who, despite all his powers of logic and reason, finds it difficult to reason away the anger that he knows shouldn't be there, but is.  He witnesses sexism and mistreatment of women around him, but he lacks the empathy required to say or do anything about it.<p>This concludes my armchair psychologist's analysis of <i>one possible dimension</i> of a hypothesis of why many of my generation permits geek culture to allow rampant sexism.<p>Caveats:  I have no data or training in psychology to suggest this is at all a significant factor.  But I am quite familiar with the phenomenon, and I know several other nerds who experience the same thing.    I mention it only because it seems the zeitgeist is that men don't even see the sexism.  I posit that many do see it, but it doesn't matter to (a good portion of) them.  And that a possible cause of this in geek culture specifically is latent adolescent anger at women.",1324098090

That is, they are people from Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic cultures. In a provocative review paper published last week, a pair of researchers argues that WEIRDos aren't representative of humans as a whole and that psychologists routinely use them to make broad, and quite likely false, claims about what drives human behavior.""",1280476345

I often don't even open my laptop at home because I just don't have the time.<p>Personally, I realized that (a) I can't live with the idea of working at a big corp until I retire and (b) if I wish to remain married and connect with my kids (you only have 10 years!) I don't have the time to do this on the side.  Given those two truths I decided to lock in our expenses (i.e. making more money doesn't help my goal if we just spend it) and switch to consulting.  As a consultant I make enough that I can periodically take 6 months off to give my start up ideas another go.  If the business gets some traction then maybe I can stay off longer than 6 months.

1560500,comment,1560370,1560440,0,0,silencio,,,"Agreed.<p>As depressing as this comic can seem to people only superficially aware of what ADHD is...that's not quite what being on stimulants makes me feel. On one hand, you do see a side of me that can sit down and get something boring done and you might think that it's turned me into an automaton (what an appropriate description). But what most people don't see is the lessening of a buildup of frustration, depression, disintegrating self-esteem, breakdowns when my coping mechanisms fail, the shame and anger from being called ""lazy"" or told I'm ""lacking willpower"". Add to that growing up with adults like the teachers/school counselors around me that were convinced I was just lazy because I was a ""know it all"" that clearly should be able to do whatever I was asked to do and I was not hyper so obviously my problem wasn't ADHD (I have inattentive-type ADHD), I just needed to get my shit together...apparently.<p>Still to this day and no more a kid, people still say the same hurtful things to me, and add to that the sneer of either ""you must be abusing those drugs"" or ""yeah right, who really has ADHD as an adult"". Except, you know, my problems now are not my pre-algebra homework from 5th grade or who thinks what of me on the playground. They're the more serious relationships, bills, jobs, and other general adult responsibilities I struggle with and that I would very much regret if they went down the same path my pre-algebra homework went. I have some ways to cope with this without being medicated, but if I did not have my Adderall nowadays, my life would eventually become a disaster. I don't hyperfocus on something I know I hate doing, it just helps me improve focus on the things in my life that matter to me. It is exactly what you say...it may let me do my work in half the time it otherwise does, but it also means I can spend more time delving into things rather than running around everywhere (mentally speaking). My creative output <i>increases</i> as a result.<p>There are plenty of stupid parents out there that abuse ADHD diagnoses and drugs so their kids have an advantage over others. There are plenty of older teens and adults that use them for whatever benefit they might get (see even the HN topics that pop up once in a while about various nootropics). There's definitely issues with abuse and misdiagnoses here. None of that discounts the fact that some people do have a problem, and that drugs like Ritalin can make a huge positive difference in their lives.<p>Too bad people will stick with their stereotypical nonsense regardless.",1280475059

1560483,comment,1560246,1560246,0,0,btilly,,,"False.  I can think of multiple exceptions.<p>Let me give three.  First some large companies (like eBay) which do not do a good job of figuring out where to advertise for themselves, and are willing to let affiliates scoop up margin instead of figuring it out.  Second there are comparison shopping companies which buy ads to sell traffic, but with the trick being that the traffic is sold to multiple places.  (This is actually a benefit to the consumer because it saves them having to look on multiple sites.)  Third there are companies that collect enough information to deliver more targeted advertising than could have been delivered from the original spot the ad was placed.  An example of this is Campus Explorer.<p>I personally know people who are making money with all of these approaches.  Details differ widely.  However the commonality is that if you're getting into this type of business, execution matters a lot.  You are explicitly trying to live off of the difference between your ability to buy advertising and someone else's ability to do the same.  So unless you can execute better than them, and better than your competitors, you're going to quickly find yourself losing money on every transaction.

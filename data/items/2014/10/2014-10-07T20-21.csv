8423980,comment,8421562,8423065,0,0,enraged_camel,,,"It&#x27;s worth noting that most popular web apps today started out as related but different ideas, and it wasn&#x27;t always a result of some clear-cut vision. Twitter for example was a group SMS service and there was a lot of uncertainty about its actual purpose and utility, even among the founding team:<p>>>&quot;With Twitter, it wasn&#x27;t clear what it was. They called it a social network, they called it microblogging, but it was hard to define, because it didn&#x27;t replace anything. There was this path of discovery with something like that, where over time you figure out what it is. Twitter actually changed from what we thought it was in the beginning, which we described as status updates and a social utility. It is that, in part, but the insight we eventually came to was Twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network.&quot; -Evan Williams<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter#History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter#History</a>",1412715594

From the article:<p>> Angell’s attack came at the same time that the FDA was reporting that much like 2011, 2012 has proven to a great year for patients with the approval of 35 innovative drugs.<p>Here is the actual argument from the book:<p>&quot;In the five years from 1998 through 2002 [...] 415 new drugs were approved -- an average of 83 per year. Of those, 133 (32 percent) were new molecular entities. The others were variations of old drugs. And of those 133, only 58 were priority review drugs. That averages out to no more than 12 innovative drugs per year, or 14 percent of the total.&quot;<p>&quot;Over the four years beginning in 2000, there were just 32 innovative drugs out of a total of 314 approved drugs. Even in this small collection, only seven came from the top ten U.S. drug companies.&quot;<p>The book was published ten years ago, but if you look at the most recent data from the FDA then it&#x27;s similar:<p>In the five years between 2007 and 2011, a total of 119 New Molecular Entities were approved by the FDA. Of these, only 50 were granted priority review, meaning they were classified by the FDA as having the potential to provide a therapy where none exists or providing a therapy which may be potentially superior to existing therapy. Of these 50 priority NMEs, 30 were orphan drugs, meaning they were approved for diseases that affect 200,000 or fewer Americans. Of these, it&#x27;s not clear how many (if any) were created by large American pharma companies.

8423931,comment,8421263,8421263,0,0,AlyssaRowan,,,"Saw this on Twitter. Skimread the paper already. First thoughts: This is a <i>nice</i> little construct. 41KB signatures, 1K public keys and 1K private keys, and still <i>relatively</i> speedy - and <i>no state</i>! Glory hallelujah! I thought the notes at CFRG for hash-based signatures were fun but the state of a Merkle signature makes them a pain in the arse to deal with. The possibility to not have to carry around state baggage in a vaguely <i>practical</i> system has really brightened up my evening. I&#x27;m going to sit here with some rum and mull over the details.<p>Not sure I&#x27;d pick it above Ed25519 or EdDSA over E-521 today, as it&#x27;s still kind of big and slow by comparison - but compared to its peers, this looks pretty damn good. (Maybe if quantum-security is important to you, you could also use an NTRUSign variant or another lattice-based technique? But ideal lattice schemes, especially signatures, are still relatively unproven and I&#x27;m not particularly comfortable with them right now.)<p>If I was looking for a signature scheme I needed to last a few decades, I&#x27;d at least give this some careful thought to see if it met my needs. (Some time <i>after</i> the rum, of course.)<p>- - -<p>No, you can&#x27;t use this to encrypt anything: signatures only. If you don&#x27;t know the basic theory, a <i>very</i> quick and dirty primer. (Please correct me if I&#x27;ve flubbed a detail, I&#x27;ve already started on the rum. <g>)<p>Hash-based signature, all the way back from Lamport [1979]: Alice makes a secret list of b <i>pairs</i> of random numbers (=private key); publishes hashes of <i>each and every</i> number in that list (=public key). Then (perhaps later) Alice hashes message she wants to sign, then for each bit in the hash of the message, proves which bit it is by publishing either the first or second number out of those pairs <i>and throwing the other one away</i> (important). Done. Bob verifies by following the same process but checking, for each bit, that the hash of the number for that bit matches the <i>correct</i> bit (0 or 1) in Alice&#x27;s public key. Great! Bob can&#x27;t forge signatures because he&#x27;s only got the random numbers which form the hashes for the <i>correct</i> signature. Unless someone can second-preimage the hash, this is quantum-secure.<p>What&#x27;s the problem with Lamport? Alice only gets to use the key <i>once</i>. If she uses her Lamport key twice or more, she&#x27;s giving Bob enough information to start having a chance (<i>very quickly</i> an overwhelming chance, especially if Bob gets to choose the messages with an adaptive partial hash preimage attack - i.e. massaging the plaintext to contain partial second-preimage collisions of manageably few bits at a time which are the inverse of Alice&#x27;s published message hash, which is pretty much the worst-case scenario) to forge her signatures. But if she uses it only once and then throws the others away, that can&#x27;t happen.<p>Still, a signature scheme you can only use once is pretty, but irritating. One solution? Bung a Merkle hash tree underneath, very broadly speaking: between the root and the leaves, use that to stretch &quot;one time&quot; into &quot;quite a lot of times&quot;. The problem? It&#x27;s stateful, we need to know where in the tree we are. (Also, we can run out of tree.) The concept of needing to count the <i>x</i>th signature and only being able to sign a maximum of <i>y</i> signatures is counterintuitive for those used to other schemes, such as factoring/discrete-log-based signatures. There has been lots of work since the &#x27;70s on extending all that however, and a lot of variations, especially since quantum computers started to be able to count to 16, and maybe one day possibly even as high as 20, or even higher - but so far, all the published relatively-practical hash-based signature schemes <i>I&#x27;ve</i> seen are stateful.<p>What&#x27;s good about this new SPHINCS construct? It&#x27;s stateless. Also the public and private keys, as well as the signatures are both remarkably small for a hash-based signature, and it&#x27;s also pretty fast considering, thanks to some nice tuning choices and, it seems, using ChaCha12 as a sponge function?",1412714870

8423928,comment,8419658,8419658,0,0,akrymski,,,"I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s a matter of frequency, but rather a matter of value that the service ultimately provides.<p>Biggest concern with Google&#x27;s business model initially was that they are &quot;just a search engine&quot; meaning they don&#x27;t get as many page-views as portals.  However Google managed to make more money than portals because ultimately they provided more value to the adviser (less impressions, but more targeted).  At the end of the day, Google&#x27;s service was intrinsically valuable - if they charged an annual fee to access the search engine, lots of people would pay up.  The business model extracted that value, albeit in a different fashion.<p>You can&#x27;t monetise trip planning with advertising indeed because there aren&#x27;t enough users to make that model work.  But if it&#x27;s a valuable service - you should be able to charge a small fee for it.  &quot;We&#x27;ll help you plan your trip for $10.  Or $20 if you want us to put in some human effort&quot;.  Given that it takes X hours to plan a trip, and a user&#x27;s average wage is $Y per hour, some number should make sense.  And of course the service would generate leads and other commissions.<p>Would anyone pay $10 for a service that planned a trip for them?  I&#x27;m afraid not many people would, which means it&#x27;s just not as valuable as people believe it is.<p>Up-market travel agencies plan trips for wealthy clients for free - there&#x27;s plenty of commissions to go around - so that model works.  Trip planning &quot;software&quot; however doesn&#x27;t seem to provide enough value in its current form, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t feasible.  If someone booked my flights, hotels, restaurants, tours, sight-seeing, theatres etc for a 2-week journey for me, they&#x27;d probably have a decent revenue stream from commissions alone (hotels pay 15%).  Hell, I know a guy that plans trips for high-net-worth individuals and takes 10% of everything they spend.<p>I think the problem is that too many startups are afraid of the human element involved - having people make recommendations doesn&#x27;t scale - they say.  However a semi-automated approach, that gave you a real PA / concierge service throughout your trip would actually provide sufficient value imo.  I know many wealthy people that would pay significant sums to have the whole thing planned (and booked!) for them in advance.  Monopolise the up-market niche of VIP travel planning, before going mass market and you have a shot at a profitable business.",1412714833

Note that throwing-exceptions/triggering-errors/etc. is &quot;working&quot;, since it&#x27;s a valid form of control flow which the program could intercept and carry on. Aborting immediately (like a segfault) isn&#x27;t &quot;working&quot;.

They embrace this and define a new, static language which just-so-happens to share a lot of syntax and semantics with that dynamic language. For example, HipHop for PHP could not compile PHP; it could only compile a static language which looks like PHP. Likewise for ShedSkin and Python. PyPy even gives its static language a name: RPython.<p>Hence, these compilers don&#x27;t show that runtime tags and static types are the same/similar. Instead, they show that sometimes programmers without static types will use tags to do some things that static types are often used for.",1412714018

The first one is that some design decisions in the language (like restricting all the C code to C99) rule out some features which would be considered basic in a general purpose language (like listing the contents of a folder, or using sockets). These decisions make it good in other areas (like running in a very memory-constrained environment, like an embedded microprocessor). Making it fully-featured risks throwing all that away.<p>The second one is that its creators don&#x27;t want to transform it into a general purpose language.<p>>  I think the first step is to acknowledge this community fragmentation and deal with it.<p>I am sorry, but what you are referring to is not community fragmentation; it&#x27;s people who are familiar with the language, on one hand, and people who ... are not. And thus come into it with the wrong expectations. I&#x27;m not saying this to be offensive.<p>If you want a language which is at the same time embedded and general-purpose I think your best option is looking elsewhere.

- Haskell&#x27;s type system is not expressive enough to capture certain interesting properties, like linearity. (To be clear, it&#x27;s quite possible to translate any arbitrary transducer into Haskell -- but the type system will not prevent all the mistakes it is possible to make.)
- There are different classes of transducers that Haskell people actively would <i>not</i> want to have identical types.

You mean to say that students, who spend all their time studying (and pay tuition in some countries), are in a better financial position than people who has either free time and don&#x27;t pay tuition, or has a full-time job?<p>They give it to students because that the reality is that students often don&#x27;t have any spare money for tools, but they do indeed need/use them for their education etc.",1412712218

While I&#x27;m replacing independent bulbs as they burn out, things like a vanity with 12 bulbs means dropping some $150 at once to replace all the bulbs so they will all be exactly the same model. Styling & performance is still changing rapidly enough that occasional replacement of a burnout in a group will result in inconsistent bulbs, looking sloppy.",1412712208

It&#x27;s mind boggling that people like Linus Torvalds and some others find it acceptable to throw curse words and use foul language in the public technical mail lists just because they feel frustrated or don&#x27;t like something (even if it&#x27;s justified). Or may be they feel they have some privileged status which puts them above normal manners? They don&#x27;t.

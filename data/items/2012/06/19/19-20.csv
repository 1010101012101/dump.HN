I have also several times received rather serious-looking notes in my checked luggage stating that they had gone through my luggage behind the scenes without my consent. They also demand to see at the very least an x-ray of any carry-on luggage that I take -- including special processing for shoes, anything in my pockets, and the laptop in my bag. The last time I went to the states they took a naked photograph of me with a machine that had ""X-ray vision"" (though I don't know whether it was Safe Microwave or Cancer-causing X-ray style). Nominally nobody actually saw the photograph, and it identified that my ponytail (I had one at the time) was a Serious Risk worthy of further investigation.<p>Generally speaking one tries to be several hours early to their flight.",1340135994

Now that Broadcom has come to their senses, NVIDIA is pretty much the <i>only</i> major consumer device vendor in the PC space with binary blob drivers.  Everyone else has, ultimately, folded in the face of pressure from the dogmatists.  I think Linus is pretty much winning, and the fact that NVIDIA is feeling pressure here is a good thing.<p>Do you have any examples of situations where this is making us ""MORE"" beholden to third parties?

Whether or not you are making your mortgage payment is not all that relavent to the business in terms of its profitability.<p>For example, two founders each have identical businesses. One has a $10k/month mortgage. One lives in a $400/month apartment. Which one is more profitable? Neither. If either founder chose to sell their business, they'd get the same amount. That is, the present value of the profits of either business is the same to a would-be purchaser.<p>The question that needs to be adressed is not ""How much do I need to live the way I want?"", but ""What is the market salary of someone I could hire to do my job while I sit at home and watch Shark Tank on DVR?""

I've worked for a company that provided a kernel module separately (though, it was all GPL).  There were a number of reasons for this:<p>* The architecture of our driver did not fit with the subsystem we were playing in (this was a SCSI module).  We worked with the package maintainers, and without a near complete re-write of our code, it would not have been accepted.<p>* Part of the above design was cause by cross-platform code we had (parts of the driver was shared between Windows, Linux, AIX, others).<p>* When supporting customers that run older version of a distro, there would be no-way to give them the latest features if the code was part of the kernel.  So our latest product offerings would be incompatible with older systems.  We would have been at the mercy of RedHat and SUSE to backport our drivers into their older releases. (or would have had to pay them a lot of money to do it).<p>We had a driver that basically started development in 1997 or so, that there was no-way we were going to rewrite it just to get it into the linux kernel.<p>For us, it was just way cheaper to supply the drivers outside of the kernel.",1340135660

Near the end of the submitted article is this paragraph:<p>""A second problem is that even when it comes to alternative energy sources, Germany doesn't reward carbon dioxide reduction. Rather, its policy establishes well-defined subsidies for specific technologies: a kilowatt-hour of solar power is rewarded more than power from offshore wind, which in turn earns more than power from onshore wind. Even though solar subsidies have been reduced to rates far lower than the ones Leurs locked in, solar power still pays the highest rates. If reducing emissions were the focus, however, more money would be directed toward reducing energy use. 'If you could choose the optimal instruments, focusing on those areas first where you can achieve your goals most inexpensively, you would focus not so much on renewables but much more on efficiency,' says Pittel, the energy economist from Munich.""<p>This ignores the advice of Amory Lovins<p><a href=""http://www.rmi.org/Amory+B.+Lovins"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rmi.org/Amory+B.+Lovins</a><p>(Amory Lovins profile page at Rocky Mountain Institute website)<p><a href=""http://www.ted.com/speakers/amory_lovins.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/speakers/amory_lovins.html</a><p>(TED profile)<p><a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/amory_lovins_a_50_year_plan_for_energy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/amory_lovins_a_50_year_plan_for_ene...</a><p>(TED Talk video ""A 40-year plan for energy"")<p>and generally the advice of any thoughtful scholar on how to improve worldwide energy efficiency.

The pipes are minor in comparison (in terms of materials, not in terms of construction). There isn't much if any tungsten used in a reactor, it's all ordinary iron, copper, concrete, etc.<p>In contrast a wind turbine uses hard to get neodymium rare earth magnets.<p>Nuclear plants don't require exotic materials.<p>2:<p>It's about the same for nuclear plants and wind turbines - you make a mold and pour the concrete. You might have thousands of miles of pipe, but you also produce a thousand times as much energy.<p>Not much waste in either during manufacturing - any extra metals are reused, and the concrete is poured in place. So it's about the same for turbines/nuclear plants.<p>> weight of resources/watt of generation was a good measure<p>It's an approximation of how much resources are needed (mining, energy, etc). We are worried about CO2, but mining also causes pollution, and uses energy.<p>3:<p>In a turbine it's the tower and blades both that need to be replaced due to material fatigue. The generator can be reused. The tower is wasted (it's poured concrete). The blades can be melted down, but they are light, and it's not a lot of metal - making them is the hard part.<p>We've never reused a nuclear plant (that I know of), so it's hard to say what would happen there.<p>They last a lot longer than wind turbines though, in the range of a 100 years vs 20.<p>Most likely the nuclear core would be removed, and the building reused for the next power plant. The building itself doesn't wear out, but they might redo the control equipment (pipes, wires, all very recyclable stuff).<p>4:<p>The weight of the fuel is tiny - less than 100 tons of fuel for a 1GW reactor, and it lasts around 10 years. That's equivalent to a couple of bolts on a wind turbine (which produces 1/1000 of the energy).<p>Waste is troublesome, but doesn't use a lot of materials. It's about one semi trailer load - every 10 years, for a plant that produces 1000 times as much as a turbine (which also fits on a semi).",1340135003

In one click I can find the answer, learn nothing from it and move on to the next challenge. Being able to cheat so easily is a huge turn-off to me and should be an equally big turn-off to employers/teachers who hope to utilize the badge systems these sites tout to gauge the student's abilities.<p>CodeSchool is apparently for people who already have a background in programming. Both my boyfriend and I attempted to take jQuery Air (a front-page testimonial says that someone without any JS knowledge could do it) and both of us got stuck at the same part. After doing some reading into the issue I found someone else that was having a similar problem in another course. The answer from CodeSchool was that they just assume students have the knowledge going into a course to tie up any loose ends and that it was intended that they'd have to do some research on their own. Yeah, no thanks. Furthermore, the way they handle ""hints"" is terrible and detrimental to the experience (I shouldn't have to waste 3 hints and get my score lowered in order to get to the one that's actually relevant to my problem). Another issue I had with CodeSchool is that going through the quizzes of things I already knew to get the badges, the way their app handles your input is really delicate. I wasn't able to use any shorthand CSS (for borders, CSS3 properties, etc.) without it telling me I was doing it wrong (note: Treehouse actually impressed me here). An additional gripe I have with CodeSchool is the quizzes (at least in the case of jQuery Air) feel clunky. It should be possible, if not standard, to have the video framed above the quizzes. I found myself going back and forth trying to find where the instructor mentioned a certain item that was relevant to the scenario, whereas with Treehouse, I was writing the code along with them.<p>Treehouse is, so far, the best. I liked not having to deal with the lessons associated with what I already knew and I felt the questions within those quizzes were well-rounded enough to make me feel like I wasn't cheating my way to a badge. That being said, the guy that teaches the JavaScript courses is all over the place; his variables and functions are often named ""varX"" and ""funcX"" which confuse the user, he waits until 3-5 minutes into a lesson to tell the user to comment out the last lesson (whereas sometimes he actually utilizes the previous code or variables). Where the JS fundamentals courses really fail though is in creating a <i>story</i>, a <i>scenario</i> in which we'd really have to use that code. The worst way for me to learn is to build something that has zero meaning. Writing 10 functions that do nothing but spit true and false at me isn't going to help me understand how and where I'd use such a thing. I need relevance and context.<p>Overall I've been really unhappy with the online/interactive tools available right now and have really only kept my subscriptions active in hopes that that money is going towards bettering not only the lessons themselves, but the in-browser engagements as well.<p>There are a few smaller ones I've tried out (and I'm currently registered for a few Coursera courses in case that is better suited to me), but if anyone has any suggestions about other sites I can try, please let me know!",1340134746

4133673,comment,4133269,4133269,9,0,filmgirlcw,,,"I like this a lot. I'll add a few of my own points too (though I think Zach's are great):<p>1. Practice, practice, practice. Now, I'm a hypocrite for saying this because I do tons of speaking engagements with little or no practice (which is a combination of hubris and the fact that I'm often pegged to do stuff at the last minute). Still, if you aren't comfortable speaking off the cuff or in front of a crowd, practice makes perfect.<p>Something I've often done is to do screen recordings like Zach says -- but instead of doing them of the talk live, I do them before the presentation. The advantage here is that I can practice what I want to say, listen back to my cadence and then adjust and readjust if necessary. By the third or fourth time, I'm usually golden and I have a great master copy that I can try to mimic live on stage.<p>2. The better you get. -- This is true of almost anything, but it's especially true of speaking in public. You'll become more comfortable and natural on stage (or on camera) and have a much better sense of how to steer a talk, how to keep your energy up and how to come across as assured.<p>3. Record yourself in advance. For beginning public speakers, it's important that you record what you sound like so that you can adjust your speed (slow down or speed up) and cadence. It can be odd to hear yourself speak at first, but once you get used to it, you can adjust what you look and sound like. This is especially important if you are doing any media appearances.<p>4. Watch Yourself After -- If your speech or conference is being recorded (or if you are recording yourself) -- watch it back after. Again, it can be disconcerting but it's a great time to learn how you can improve next time. It's also a great way to see how you progress over time. If I look at my first CNN appearance in April of 2011 and my most recent appearance, it's like night and day. That helps me when I get up to present at an event, keynote a conference or do another media appearance.",1340134377

It also can cause substantial stalls in InnoDB as the buffer pool is scanned for matching pages and are flushed out.

The fact that you have found a very specific reason for your dislike doesn't any in way invalidate Wolfe's authorship or his readers as much as it further illuminates your own way of thinking.<p>In fact, in one sense your explanation is painfully ironic, as you seem to consider yourself morally superior to those readers who -- you claim -- read Wolfe for entirely superficial reasons. Are we really stooping so low now as to criticize people for their reading tastes or to second-guess their reasons for reading what they do?<p>Personally I derive as much pleasure from reading Wolfe as I do from Lem, although I would never compare them. And the key word is ""pleasure"": I, like I suppose most people, read books to enjoy them. I enjoy Wolfe for many reasons, but ""moreal superiority"" is not one of them. And I am wary of terms such as ""literary significance"" to guide my tastes; that's a term for scholars and academics to worry about, as a reader I am concerned with books and stories that affect me emotionally and stimulate me intellectually.<p>I see your point about Wolfe's complexity being more of a device and less about genuine depth. Despite this, I do enjoy the richness it imparts on the narrative. Wolfe's template is Borges, who uses similar devices and whose stories often have a sort of insular quality where the narrative only exists to create a clever gadget whose cleverness can be admired, but cannot be applied to anything outside itself. For example, Borges has a neat story, <i>The House of Asterion</i>, about a lonely person who roams a large house with many corridors; at the end of the story is killed, and we realize that he's the minotaur in the myth about Theseus.<p>As for <i>The New Sun</i>, I think that Severian's unreliability is more a ruse (or at best evidence of a flawed character) than an important plot point -- compare this to his Latro trilogy, set in ancient Greece, where the main character, having suffered brain damage, is unable to form new memories, and is therefore genuinely unreliable. <i>The Short Sun</i> also has a character who loses his sense of identity when his mind is merged with another's, and his lack of reliability comes from an inability or refusal to recognize who he actually is.<p>(Incidentally, while I admire <i>The New Sun</i> greatly, I found its two loose sequels, <i>The Long Sun</i> and <i>The Short Sun</i>, to be much more emotionally stimulating. It helps that the main characters are not borderline sociopaths. They are also less prone to the kind of cryptic connections that are evident in the first book.)",1340133574

Knowing Microsoft, I've got to think they are aggressively aiming for a November release date for the first version and a February or March for the Pro.

Quite the contrary, I believe the term engineer is grossly overused.<p>I'm a Software Engineer student in an Engineering University, sitting through purely engineering-related (as opposed to development-related) courses such as software requirements analysis and studying software development processes.  It pains me to see articles like these where people belittle the engineering profession.  It's not about pride or entitlement, it's about the fact that a software engineer (at least here in Quebec) is someone part of the Order of Engineers and who bears along with his/her title the burden of social responsibility.<p>Designing great UX/front-ends is a very tough job and I believe should be rewarded and designated as such but writing code and creating software does not qualify you automatically for the title of engineer.  You went to school, passed the Order of Engineer exams (or equivalent) and were granted the engineer title, you get to be called as such (and get to have the word engineer in your job title).

How big these problems are varies greatly from person to person and machine to machine.<p>The proprietary drivers likely won't ever interact well with the ecosystem due to their closed-source nature (although the situation could certainly be improved), while the open-source drivers could do better talking to the GPU if they had specifications and not just reverse-engineered info.",1340132844

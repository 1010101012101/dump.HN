8651524,comment,8650483,8650997,0,0,sytelus,,,"That&#x27;s what I&#x27;d thought for may be over a decade. About ~3 years ago I revamped my personal coding style to eliminate as unnecessary baggage as possible. As part of that I stopped using braces for single line if and I&#x27;d yet to bump in a bug <i>because</i> of that. Overall I find code looks more compact and cleaner, may be even less friction to read. Nowadays when I see a braces around single line if I get that &quot;oh that&#x27;s clunky code&quot; feeling in my stomach. Things are worse with C# and lot of Java code where people insist not only having braces around single line if but also have { on its own separate lines.<p>I think a good language shouldn&#x27;t have braces to mark blocks in first place. Given indentation,they are redundant most of the times and they just contribute in clunk. This is exactly the case with Python and hence this is essentially a default style and people hadn&#x27;t be complaining about it&#x27;s causing bugs.",1416818886

8651518,comment,8650904,8651327,0,0,ridiculous_fish,,,"Oh yeah, I love this stuff.<p>On my Linux box, clang 3.4 is 50% slower than gcc 4.9 on -O3 on that code, for all inputs.<p>The key difference is, unsurprisingly, in the inner block: for (int j = 0; j < 50000; j++)...<p>clang&#x27;s inner block asm: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/ridiculousfish/24b16ba5b4e8abbe051b"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/ridiculousfish/24b16ba5b4e8abbe051b</a><p>gcc&#x27;s inner block asm: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/ridiculousfish/bee5217d6ae1f4f34a5d"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/ridiculousfish/bee5217d6ae1f4f34a5d</a><p>Notice that clang&#x27;s is much longer. Also notice all of the &quot;# imm = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFC00&quot; lines in clang. Those immediate values correspond to inlining the norm() functions: it&#x27;s how clang is computing x%1024.<p>How do you compute x%1024? It sure would be nice to strength-reduce it to x&1023, but that&#x27;s always going to produce a non-negative number, which is not what you want if x is negative. That is, -1025 % 1024 ought to be -1, and not 1023. So that strength reduction (x%1024 -> x&1023) is only valid if you can prove that x is non-negative.<p>And that&#x27;s the first big difference. gcc-4.8 convinces itself that all of the ints involved are non-negative, and so it computes x%1024 as x&1023. clang fails to notice that all ints are non-negative, and so emits the slow path for the mod.<p>Let&#x27;s replace int with unsigned int, and see what happens:<p>clang&#x27;s uint asm: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/ridiculousfish/c35ffcff5963160c9622"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/ridiculousfish/c35ffcff5963160c9622</a><p>This allows the x&1023 strength reduction, but now we hit the second big difference: clang is futzing with xmm registers, perhaps packing a single &#x27;vec&#x27; into a register. The codegen just looks silly to me - all those pshufd and punpckldq. Let&#x27;s disable that noise with -mno-sse:<p>clang&#x27;s uint asm (no SSE): <a href=""https://gist.github.com/ridiculousfish/0afc79d458ae30dc6327"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/ridiculousfish/0afc79d458ae30dc6327</a><p>Now clang is totally kicking ass, with fewer instructions than gcc, and about 17% faster. (Of course gcc may in turn be massaged to be even faster yet.)<p>Timings on my i3 NUC with -O3, input 4. Lower is better:<p>gcc w/ signed: 4.78 sec<p>clang w/ signed: 7.11 sec<p>gcc w/ unsigned: 3.83 sec<p>clang w/ unsigned: 7.11 sec<p>clang w/ unsigned no-sse: 3.14 sec<p>In summary, clang is missing a big optimization, and then emitting some dubious SSE code. Fixing those more than doubles its speed. This illustrates the importance of monitoring your codegen for tight loops, and the hazards of micro benchmarks!",1416818608
8651517,comment,8650126,8650463,0,0,josteink,,,"Back when you wanted to encode a DVD to the size of one (or maybe two) CDs, having audio-passthrough was not an option. You typically re-encoded the data from 384-448kbps (for AC3-surround) down to 128kbps stereo. For that you used MP3 audio.<p>I also recall the earlier Frauenhofer MP3 codecs incorrectly reported audible length of chunk-sizes (or something like that) causing incremental audio-skew and sync-issues with the corresponding video the longer into the movie you came.<p>It seemed impossible to fix and was terribly frustrating.<p>Eventually the tools caught up and patched up the data, or we got better tools (like lame) which didn&#x27;t produce the faulty artefacts to begin with.<p>Maybe this is what he&#x27;s talking about, as the Frauenhofer MP3-codec was very much a Windows-only thing.",1416818596

It&#x27;s just a unique identifier.<p>> Source control management systems such as Git and Mercurial use SHA-1 not for security but for ensuring that the data has not changed due to accidental corruption. Linus Torvalds has said about Git: &quot;If you have disk corruption, if you have DRAM corruption, if you have any kind of problems at all, Git will notice them. It&#x27;s not a question of if, it&#x27;s a guarantee. You can have people who try to be malicious. They won&#x27;t succeed. [...] Nobody has been able to break SHA-1, but the point is the SHA-1, as far as Git is concerned, isn&#x27;t even a security feature. It&#x27;s purely a consistency check. The security parts are elsewhere, so a lot of people assume that since Git uses SHA-1 and SHA-1 is used for cryptographically secure stuff, they think that, OK, it&#x27;s a huge security feature. It has nothing at all to do with security, it&#x27;s just the best hash you can get.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1#Data_integrity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1#Data_integrity</a>",1416816182

Note that a strategy of &quot;not eating&quot; doesn&#x27;t work.  I tried it.  When I get hungry, no matter how hard I try, pretty soon I&#x27;ll eat something, unless I&#x27;m already in the middle of doing something which makes that impractical.  My mind right now can decide it&#x27;ll eat less or delay eating, <i>in the future</i>, but the mind later will disagree.  I have on many occasions walked out the door telling myself to turn around and not drive to the 7-11 and not get a Coke, and maybe half the time I do so.<p>I don&#x27;t think you really appreciate what it&#x27;s like to be fat and hungry and how that affects the ability to make good long term eating habits.  Blaming somebody for being fat when they eat when hungry seems to make as much sense to me as blaming a fat cat for eating all the food their owner gives them.  Imagine living life following the rule that whenever you have to pee, you&#x27;ve got to wait 3 hours before peeing.  It&#x27;s something like that.  If you want to recommend a successful strategy I recommend recommending one where you avoid the signal altogether.  Suggesting that people try to directly ignore their primitive biological urges is simply ridiculous, that&#x27;s like thinking you can hire somebody with poor conscientiousness but make up for it by telling them, &quot;Be more conscientious!&quot;",1416816069

I had some very strong intuitions about some obscure computer science problem (maybe 10 people worked on it worldwide, but I think they gave up already). I was thinking about this problem for at least one year, with some periods of very intensive thinking. I could have really used that time more productively, because that was already quite a busy period for me, but the solution seemed so close.<p>After about one year, I finally had a solution mapped out, which I think would work. However, there were some major implementation problems (memory complexity). That was the time when I was finally able to let it go.<p>So the advise that I would give to people is: focus on real-world problem, that real people have.",1369036753

The key is to realize that the problem solving doesn't happen in the second step, but rather in the first. Writing down your problem means you have to structure it in some way, to frame it in a way that at least can be represented on paper. Perhaps it's a formalization, or simply a brief explanation. In any case, step 2 is only possible because of step 1 for most interesting problems. Even for those of us who aren't Feynman.",1369036681

This is not something HMRC alone can easily fix, nor is it a flaw in just one set of laws, but a lack of international control  governing corporate behaviour, which is unlikely to be resolved soon unless you want to see a world state. The reason for the special deals is that corporations have many ways of pressuring governments (jobs, investment, etc) and the big ones wield more power and influence than the state itself.<p>Instead perhaps you could try being angry at large corporations for evading their responsibilities as corporate <i>citizens</i> to pay tax, for dissembling about where revenue is generated and how in an attempt to avoid tax, for creating subsidiaries and licensing agreements solely to declare a nominal loss, and for creating complex chains of companies in many different countries in an attempt to evade tax. Despite the apparent clarity of terms like avoidance and evasion, or legal and illegal, which people use to describe these activities and make them appear simple, there is no clear line between avoidance and evasion, only a set of interpretations, and in this case Google have strayed too close to evasion in the opinion of this whistleblower and of HMRC. Given the evidence presented and the lack of convincing answers from Google, I'm inclined to agree.",1369036399

5736449,comment,5735002,5736073,1,0,smalboy,,,"Hello OP! :><p>I'd suggest since you have already had a nice amount of links built to the site and with only 1 type of anchor text then just build more links at a steady pace to the site itself with varying anchor texts and link types (hxxp://www.website.com, www.website.com, website.com) and ther variations. Vary dofollow and nofollow too. While doing all of this don't forget to build backlinks similar to he ones that you have built previously. Stopping to build links with a certain combination of anchor text will seem to Google as being very very unnatural.<p>Also, begin building your own blog network- and then build links to the blogs in the blog network. I like to call those sites ""Buffer sites"" since they will be taking the load of my linkbuilding efforts. Load these sites up with content, full on blogs with regular posts, privacy policy and the works. Have content that is valuable to visitors and hen funnel the visitors on to your main site. You would then be able to have a bunch of blogs that bring in traffic to the main site itself since the blogs would've been jam-packed with content and would funnel the users into your ecommerce site. This would have a couple of benefits: When you rank the blogs you get them up for your keywords, and since the blogs link to your ecommerce store the store climbs up there too. So basically using this by doing 1 set of linkbuilding you can dominate the whole of page 1 for your keywords.<p>Would be awesome if we could connect. You seem to be a very interesting person to talk to :>",1369036044

The old way being television or in relation to this posting, Disney and ""…stupid adult stereotypes, sarcasm, backstabbing behavior, and contempt…"". The new way being ""interactive"" media, or in relation to this posting, Minecraft and related content consumed where ""Bad language is easy to curb…"".<p>The ""stupid adult stereotypes, sarcasm, backstabbing behavior, and contempt"" is hardly unique Disney or other child TV consumption (or TV for that matter…). One thing people point out with television consumption people have stated time and time again, is that it hardly invites it's viewers to explore ideas outside of the content while viewing. Then it seems like some how, the ability to be able to interact with media with content like Minecraft is some how better (allows children to be more creative, enabling more thinking, or whatever people say the benefits are compared to what people think of television now [though I bet some people were touting the benefits of television not to long ago…]), which I can see/understand the argument being made here for that with the logic being made on surface level.<p>However, the thing is that it isn't like what the children are doing is outside of the purpose of the game and are very much only able to do things within the constructs the game. At the end of the day, it is still a game. And like Disney shows or the like, it still does not invite the player to explore ideas and concepts that are going within the game at the same time. So to me, it seems like overall the child is no better off with being able to digest things like ""Bad language…"" and notions of ""…stupid adult stereotypes, sarcasm, backstabbing behavior, and contempt""(hardly unique to our times since it is apart of human nature after all) that could be going on in the game or other consumable content related.<p>It seems to me it would be foolish to think that this ""new interactive media"" does any more or less compared to the ""old way"" (TV, or the tech before that like radio and even books) when it comes to addressing the underlying issues being avoided.

5736439,comment,5734480,5735328,6,0,616c,,,"Good for you, and I seriously mean that.  One of my friends, who actually finished a BA and dropped out of a MA degree (not to say your educational credentials matter, but it will become relevant later in my post) had some really neat ideas on ancient Semitic linguistics, related to a bunch of wall inscriptions he found out about while living in Egypt.  He later tried to contact the foremost authority, a Western academic who is one of the few who had any interest or academic weight (with a topic this esoteric, I imagine the former is more important) and present his ideas.  Needless to say, that ancient Semitic linguist was not amused.  He not only ripped into my friend, but at the suggestion my friend visit the site that inspired him to do said research, the professor mentioned he had an exclusive memorandum of understanding with the Egyptian governmental body in charge of the antiquities, and threatened him if he ever visited without the permission the professor had no intention of providing, he would be arrested.  Keep in mind he was not even in the locale, but in the United States.  I saw subsequent emails where he refused to even consider my friends theories, and was increasingly dismissive.<p>So my friend, not easily discouraged, went on to contacting the less than a dozen experts in this field, few with any knowledge on this period.  He presented paper drafts to several; many ignored, and those who responded rudely dismissed him without getting into the content.<p>Maybe it is just because the field is narrow, but I suspect certain academic disciplines believe in some kind of job security, and pouncing on amateurs and pushing them out the door, regardless of their perceived contribution to the field, is paramount.  I am glad you have had the opposite experience.<p>I too a masters degree dropout from an accelerated program, and left with out the masters in the bachelors masters combo.  Why?  Because despite the money I never had experiences like you in school.  All the teachers in my program, despite thinking my knowledge level was quite strong and generally liked me, disliked meeting with me outside of class or pushing me to read or study things we could discuss.  I got disheartened, and was disgusted at how many teachers do not belong in academia, and just like the echo chamber of their own ideas.  I know I could have made a better effort, but the lack of effort on their end to sit and talk with anyone who had a modicum of interest was shocking to me.  To this day, I wish private universities would take the out of class contact more seriously in evaluating professors, because your comment proves no one is too busy to talk on academic subject they are passionate about.  My friend's anecdote just shows some cliques are just that, and letting anyone is calculated risk to the group regardless of contribution; some people will never take that risk.<p>I just wish assholes like that would go somewhere else other than a university setting.<p>tl;dr I had the opposite experience with academics, and one of my friends tried hard in a very small domain and had even worse results; YMMV and some academics have no interest in spreading knowledge at all.

Whether or not you think the issue is more complex, the fact of it is very well established: in general, absent other measures of utility, price signals are used by purchasers in their initial valuation of a commodity.  It's a limit example of the anchoring bias, a cognitive effect to which most humans are ridiculously susceptible.<p>There is a flow-on effect in the way consumers interact with a service provider, too: per account, you'll receive more complaints from free users than paying ones; vice-versa, more constructive suggestions from paying users than non-paying users.  This result is explained as a choice-supportive response [look it up; ""the tendency to retroactively ascribe more positive attributes to a choice invested into""], since the opposite behaviour would be a source of cognitive dissonance.  It can be a source of frustration to paying users that their suggestions/requests are not then more highly valued by the service provider.",1369035383

If Google has many employees in the UK booking sales, generating revenue paid into a UK bank account, but classified as going through Ireland purely as a tax dodge, as the whistleblower alleges, that's illegal evasion, not avoidance. It's morally wrong, but it's also illegal, and the complexity and long-term planning in this scheme shows that Google the corporation is not as innocent and naive about taxes as they'd like to appear. There's an interesting post hellbanned on this discussion from emmelie pointing out just how complicated the schemes are - does Google still use Google Ireland Holdings, Bermuda?<p>For governments like the UK or US, this has become an important issue, as if they don't tackle this now, revenue from corporations and rich individuals (who often structure their accounts to receive revenue through corporations) will eventually dry up completely as everyone could choose the lowest tax jurisdiction and simply pretend to conduct all business there with loss-making subsidiaries in every other market. This is not limited to Google as all major corporations have started doing this (even the leading left-wing newspaper, the Guardian), and HMRC has just started clamping down on it.<p>A world where corporations avoid tax completely is not a world I want to live in, and it's not one Google (if they truly believe their mantra 'Don't be evil') should aspire to either. They should simply shut down schemes to move their revenue to other countries <i>solely for the benefits of tax evasion</i> and instead book revenue in the country it is generated in.",1369035004

I mean, there's of course a per-row overhead on a DB, but many rows get put into the same page - so I'm not sure how that's remotely as wasteful as a hypothetical filesystem that uses a minimum of a page-per-file.  Of course, that's not a requirement for FS behaviour - just historically a lot of them have worked that way.<p>> Reading/writing data from a database requires syscalls too<p>Not for stuff that's in the DB's page cache.<p>> Arguably the database is duplicating the caching logic of the OS and slows things down.<p>That's a pretty biased assessment.  A 'real' database like Postgres will use calls that bypass the OS page cache, so there's no duplication there.

Managing concurrent read/writes over sets of files (say) is currently difficult.  Sure, your FS could have deadlock detection, MVCC and so on built into it, but that would be turning the file system into even more of a database system than it already is.

I find this article blames the usual culprits :<p>> C.E.O.s in the food industry are typically not technical guys, and theyre uncomfortable going to meetings where technical people talk in technical terms about technical things, Behnke said. They dont want to be embarrassed. They dont want to make commitments. They want to maintain their aloofness and autonomy.<p>I'm not claiming this true or false. However, if this isn't blaming, then what is ?<p>From the article in Scientific American:<p>> According to the General Mills letter, if everyone in the US started eating healthfully, it would cost us $503 billion per year! That might affect our ability to pay CEOs like General Mills Ken Powell annual compensations of more than $12 million.<p>Same.<p>My beefs here:
1) this guys' job is not to keep America thin or healthy. That's the job of Americans. I especially do not want government to dictate what is acceptable food (beyond verifying it is safe - as in not poison or rotten)
2) that $503 billion has to come from somewhere. Given the margins on food companies, that money is not coming from their profits, because it just isn't there. So this is another tax on the poor.<p>This is nothing but another case of rich people ""wondering"" why everyone doesn't eat according to the very latest trends that they currently consider in vogue. I know why. So does everyone else. The question is not more interesting than why everyone seems to prefer non-Ferrari cars.<p>From the same article:
> Of course, we dont necessarily want you to be unhealthy. Its just that its so much more profitable to provide foods that happen to be unhealthy. Weve been able to industrialize the food system so that we can produce massive amounts of the cheapest ingredients available, in the cheapest, most efficient way possible.<p>I wonder why we have industrialized the food system ...

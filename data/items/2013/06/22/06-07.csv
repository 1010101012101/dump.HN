From a software engineer&#x27;s perspective, including 3rd party libraries in one source tree it transfers the burden of maintenance and support to one project maintainer. Not reinventing the wheel is good and all, but you still have to maintain its integrity.<p>From a package maintainer&#x27;s perspective, especially in the case of Debian, they must ensure that packages are stable and secure. It&#x27;s their job to make sure security updates are released. In the case of FreeSWITCH, there&#x27;s no distinction between the main source and its dependencies. Package maintainers might as well not bother with including software like FreeSWITCH in their repos or risk the integrity of their system.<p>System implementer&#x27;s are mostly ambivalent about these issues until their distro&#x27;s FreeSWITCH package includes broken dependencies or until their FreeSWITCH installation has a security exploit due to a library that can&#x27;t be patched independently.<p>I love FreeSWITCH but I&#x27;m sorry to say that it&#x27;s poorly architected.

It&#x27;s like a Roomba for push backs :-)<p>I assume the bot autonomously &#x27;docks&#x27; with the plane, then the pilot takes over control and pushes back.  Then the bot autonomously returns back to its docking station by the jet bridge.<p>I suppose a single bot could do push backs for 3 or 4 neighboring jets, if they&#x27;re just doing the push back. If it&#x27;s taxing the jet all the way down the runway, I guess it&#x27;s more of a 1:1 ratio, and probably a lot more complicated to work the returning units into ground traffic control, to the point where you need to work it into the overall airport design?",1371881869

In my mind, only very few persons would take to the streets and sacrifice their livelihoods and personal convenience for abstract ideas and principles. Case in point, Edward Snowden.<p>Until the effects of corruption has reached, in a literal sense, the doors of most Americans, we might see citizens act and begin to stand for abstract ideas such as privacy, due process, etc. But I think they would only continue until it becomes most inconvenient for them.<p>I guess this is a cynical way of looking at people but maybe I&#x27;m not in a good state of mind at the moment.",1371881423

In the Americas, that was mostly the motivation for the Virginia Company and the Massachusetts Bay Company were commercial ventures. People went to Jamestown hoping to find gold. Eventually word got out that the survival rate was in the very low double-digit percentage and they had to start offering people large tracts of land. Eventually the colonies started to export tobacco back to Europe and the tax revenues generated was always welcome.<p>If those colonists go, it&#x27;ll because they&#x27;re dying to get rich.",1371880819

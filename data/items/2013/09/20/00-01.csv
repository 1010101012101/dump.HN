The most obvious evidence: Nintendo did excellently in Japan while exerting significantly less pressure than they did on companies that wished to produce games for the American market. The Famicom had no lockout chip. Nintendo did not impose a strict 3 game per-year limit in the Japanese market like they did in America. Third parties were allowed to manufacture their own game cartridges; there is direct physical evidence of this fact in the varying shapes and vibrant colors of the cartridges themselves[1], and the existence of customs ICs and discrete mapper designs common in Famicom cartriges. In addition to slimming margins for third party developers, this also made supply and demand problems very difficult to deal with, as tinco mentioned. Remember how Nintendo infamously forbade third party devs from publishing games for competing platforms in America? Didn&#x27;t happen in Japan, and so a fair amount of early Famicom games received ports to the MSX and other Japanese computers.<p>The Famicom did have some amount of Atari 2600-goldrush-esque crappy games (some licensed, some not), but it didn&#x27;t stop the console from being a huge success. This suggests to me that Nintendo&#x27;s reasoning was only part &quot;Americans will flood the market with shitty games again if we don&#x27;t do something about it,&quot; with pure monopolistic greed being the other part.<p>With all due respect to Hiroshi Yamauchi, I don&#x27;t think their business practices during this era should be considered at all admirable, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right to credit their monopolistic practices for &quot;saving the medium.&quot;",1379637537

Compared to what? The MacOS at the time was extremely primitive and ugly. Amiga had a real shell, it had ARexx, vastly superior to AppleScript, it had the equivalent of FUSE filesystems for tons of stuff, compression, networking (DNet), I regularly multitasked between my terminal/dialup and my programming environment. &quot;Workbench&quot;, the drag-and-drop &quot;Finder&quot; equivalent was ugly and shitty, but Amiga users didn&#x27;t use it for much anyway.<p>Yes, the Amiga was not a good &quot;office&quot; computer, it was a home computer, and in that regard, for the market it was targeting -- grown up 8-bitters, it blew away the Mac hard. I had a MacSE, it sat in a closet and in fact, running a MacOS emulator on my Amiga was a better experience than running the real Mac, and I only ran the Mac when I needed to run something required for college that was not available for the Amiga, and that was rare.<p>Nobody I knew in my age range when the Amiga came out gave a hoot about Word Perfect or Excel. The Amiga had perfectly usable, &quot;Google Docs&quot;-like simple word processors that were perfectly fine for most work. I did a lot of my college work with an awesome text editor and LaTeX on the Amiga.<p>There is nothing the Mac really had over the Amiga in it&#x27;s day, except for AppleTalk, and some high end DTP software, at huge expense. For the home user, especially the creative person interested in art, music, or coding, the Amiga was far better. Compare MacPaint vs DigiPaint for example.<p>Commodore lost their lead by the time the MacII color and PC SVGA rolled out, because they did not put priority into new custom chipsets until it was too late. AGA/AAA arrived way after it had been surpassed by commodity SVGA cards, and the radical designs Dave Hayne/Jay Miner and others were working on for next-generation 3D graphics chips for the Amiga never got the resources.<p>Ultimately, they failed by mismanagement, but the fact that it took the industry 5-7 years to catch up with Amiga Hardware is a testament to how far ahead, how much of a step-function change, the Amiga was. It was the iPhone of 1985 IMHO, but too much ahead of it&#x27;s time.<p>(BTW, the flickering issue in hires for people who needed it, was fixed by Flicker Fixers <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flicker_fixer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flicker_fixer</a>)",1379637134

It doesn&#x27;t actually help that much.<p>As a short, but helpful, side discussion consider the breeding of Pu-239 in a reactor for use in nuclear weapons. Pu-239 works great in a nuclear bomb but other isotopes of Plutonium cause problems, specifically the high spontaneous fission rate of Pu-240 can create so many background neutrons that having a significant amount of it in a bomb can vastly increase the &quot;pre-detonation&quot; (fizzle) risk, which causes the bomb to have very low yield (on the same scale as the chemical explosives in the bomb). As Plutonium remains in a reactor subject to neutron flux it will naturally breed other isotopes, which is why there is a difference between weapons grade and reactor grade Plutonium. Reactor grade Plutonium can contain any variation of isotopes, essentially all of them are suitable for use in a reactor, but weapons grade Plutonium can only have a very small amount of Pu-240. And for this reason the way that weapons grade Plutonium is made is by removing fuel rods from a reactor on very short time scales and reprocessing it to remove the Plutonium then forming it back into new fuel rods and so forth. This is a very costly and complex endeavor which is why you can&#x27;t just use ordinary power reactors for generating weapons grade Plutonium.<p>Interestingly, Pu-238 also exists in reactor grade Plutonium in substantial amounts (1% or more of the Plutonium, so nearly an entire tonne per year worldwide). However, because it&#x27;s mixed up with all of the other Plutonium it would require extremely costly isotopic separation.<p>So, how is this relevant to Thorium reactors? Well, let&#x27;s go back and look at what actually happens when Pu-238 is produced in a Thorium reactor. You start with Th-232, and under neutron flux you&#x27;ll breed U-233, which is the reactor&#x27;s main fission fuel. If U-233 is hit by a neutron and absorbs it instead of fissioning then you can end up with U-234, U-235, U-236, Np-237 (through a decay), and Pu-238 (through another decay). However, it&#x27;s not as though things don&#x27;t stop there. Pu-238 will breed into Pu-239, Pu-240, and so on, just as in a conventional Uranium power reactor.<p>So here you have the same problem as producing weapons grade Plutonium, you have a process that you need to stop before it goes too far, and in order to do that you need to pull the Plutonium out of the reactor at regular, short intervals. Otherwise you&#x27;ll just get a buildup of ordinary reactor grade Plutonium. However, the problem is worse here because instead of being the product of just one neutron reaction (natural U-238 becoming Pu-239) the breeding of RTG grade Plutonium is the product of a long chain of reactions (taking 6 steps between the isotopes in the reactor fuel at the start and the production of Pu-238). This means the amount of production and the time scales of production are very much not helpful from the perspective of pure Pu-238 production, especially if you want to also operate a power reactor cost-effectively at the same time.<p>(Edit: also, there&#x27;s an additional problem, because Thorium reactor fuel contains U-232, which has a short half-life and has decay products that are prodigious gamma ray sources, making reprocessing and handling even more difficult than ordinary reactor fuel. You can handle Plutonium in a glove box, but with used Thorium fuel containing U-232 you&#x27;d need to handle it via robotic manipulators in a heavily shielded area distant from humans, except that gamma radiation kills electronics like nobody&#x27;s business, which is a bit of a catch-22. This is one of the key technical hurdles of Thorium reactor designs in general.)<p>In short, the fact that Thorium reactors produce Pu-238 isn&#x27;t helpful, because existing reactors do too, but in either case it&#x27;s hard to get at.",1379636789

The fact that it doesn&#x27;t have facilities for detecting and releasing cyclic references makes it definitely not the &quot;other side&quot; of the GC coin.<p>That being said, ARC-style reference counting is more limited in terms of what developers can do with their code, and it may not be a general enough solution for a language like C++ (which strives to be all things to all people). Weak pointers in Objective-C also require runtime support, which could probably not be appropriate for high-performance applications in many cases.",1379636703

In fact many, many sysadmins have. The result is an ocean of DIY container management tools, each incompatible with the other, and each not quite generic or polished enough to be made usable by others because, well, sysadmins have real work to do :)<p>So the question really is: is it valuable to federate efforts so that instead of 1000 incompatible and unpolished tools, we get a small number of tools which are more polished and more interoperable? I believe the answer is yes, because it allows the use of containers not just as a site-specific deployment tool, but as a mechanism for <i>code distribution and re-use</i>. We can make containers as useful as libraries! That is not possible unless we agree on some sort of standard &quot;call convention&quot;.<p>Now, you may agree with this but answer &quot;but these tools already exists: look at lxc, openvz and libvirt&quot;, then I respectfully disagree. If those tools were sufficient, sysadmins and developers would just use them directly, instead of each writing elaborate abstractions over them. These tools were not designed to use containers as units of software distribution and re-use. They were designed to use containers as lightweight servers. Basically like a VM but faster.

Hipsters are a totally made-up label to brand people with that are into different shit.  Would we have called Dylan a hipster (in the derogatory sense, not the beatnik sense)?  What about Steve Jobs in the early days?  Shoot, even Woz wore some pretty ironic bow-ties (definite hipster).<p>What&#x27;s also a gas is that all these &quot;hipster bashers&quot; are so heck-darn defensive of mainstream culture.

So why are people so darn defensive about people who are trying to explore different things.<p>The &quot;hipster&quot; label is a sickeningly old cliche.  Seriously.  So-called &quot;hipster-bashing&quot; has been going on for 10 years now (it all started with &#x27;the hipster handbook&#x27;.  I&#x27;ve never really got it either.  I mean, people don&#x27;t actively go out and go &quot;right, I&#x27;m going to be a hipster&quot;.

Why bash others, just because you can&#x27;t step out of your box.<p>Then again - maybe the definition of a hipster is someone who does actively embrace the attributes of this made-up subculture to form an identity - without understanding the depths of what they are appropriating.

So the classical interface between the cartridge and the Atari is only handling turning the beam on and off and with what color.<p>I know that the Atari has a certain pixel size due to how fast it can turn the beam on and off, but working with that constraint it seems with the above method you could still produce much more complicated games that rival the interactivity of say the SNES.",1379635578

It sounds like you&#x27;ve really built her up in your mind and she probably won&#x27;t meet the expectations you&#x27;ve unintentionally set. You&#x27;ve known this girl for years. Why didn&#x27;t you ask her out right away? There&#x27;s a big chance you are now in the dreaded &quot;friend zone&quot;. This isn&#x27;t a romantic comedy. You can&#x27;t play coy with a girl and then make your sexual intentions known later. If you have the slightest inkling that you may like a girl, you should make those intentions clear from the start. That way you don&#x27;t build her up in your mind and get nervous when you ask her out. Or worse you get depressed when she doesn&#x27;t want to go on a date with you.<p>You should never put all your eggs in one basket. You should always be talking to multiple girls when you are looking to date. This way if one girl doesn&#x27;t feel the same way about you, you have other options. Options are important. It&#x27;s unhealthy to lust after one girl. (Obviously I&#x27;m not talking in the context of marriage/etc.)<p>Whatever you do, do not tell her outright that you have feelings for her. Even if she does like you, this will still put her in a rather awkward position. My personal opinion would be that you should look for another girl and forget about this one, but I know from personal experience that those words aren&#x27;t easy to hear and you won&#x27;t listen to that advice.<p>So, here&#x27;s what I suggest you do. Ask her out to something simple like coffee. It sucks to say, but if you guys already go out together to places like the coffee shop and etc. you will probably have to spell out that this is explicitly a date. This is another reason why you don&#x27;t want to wait on something like this. You need to either ask her in person or call her. Do not text, Facebook message, etc. Girls like when they can see/hear you ask them out. They size up your body language so make sure that you stand up straight. Say something like, &quot;Hey, we should go out for coffee this Saturday.&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m going to the batting cages Friday, you should come with me.&quot; If you guys do a lot of hanging out already (and it sounds like you do) I would be more upfront. Something like &quot;Let&#x27;s go out this Friday. I&#x27;ll show you the best coffee place in town.&quot; (I think you get the point.) If she declines your offer, try not get hung up on it. You probably will because like I said you&#x27;ve built her up in your mind, nevertheless, do not dwell on it too long. There are plenty of girls out there for you that are just like the girl you are lusting after now. Don&#x27;t forget that you should be the prize, not her. She is the lucky one, not you.<p>It sounds like you really have high hopes for the future. Even if you two do go out, you probably won&#x27;t end up getting married. That&#x27;s OK, though. Like I said, she&#x27;s not a snow flake. Nobody is.<p>&quot;There are lots of guys trying to win her but she hasn&#x27;t fallen for any of them...yet.&quot;<p>No offense dude, but if the girl is half as beautiful as you say she is, she is most likely having sex and has dated people in the last few years. I hope you have too. Don&#x27;t get hung up on one girl. Anyway, I hope none of this comes off too harsh. I&#x27;ve learned a lot about girls the last few years of my life and the biggest thing you need to realize is a girl is just a supplement to a great life style. Don&#x27;t base your happiness off of them. Do not build them up. They are human beings who eat, sleep, and shit, too.",1379635453

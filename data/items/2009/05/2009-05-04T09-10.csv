592176,comment,589677,590441,0,0,ztzg,,,"Thanks!  And thanks for the laugh!<p>I totally agree about NumPy and SciPy, but that doesn't mean the glue between these parts should not be optimized!  Lots of uses of Python involve modules made of native code, and we do not have the pretension to eliminate them from one day to the next.  Quite the opposite: we want to make sure both worlds work well together, and empower people to do more ambitious things on top of these concrete (in both senses of the word) foundations.<p>Another variation: let's say you have a large application written in C/C++ and want to provide a dynamic language for scripting/extensibility (think expert systems or CAD, where extensive customization is necessary).  Not only can we provide recommendations and do the integration work for you (we're a services company), but we can sprinkle the whole thing with a bit of customized magic which will give the “interpreter” an intimate knowledge of your domain objects, removing the “speed hit” barrier and opening new possibilities.<p>Which brings me to your question: what CrossTwine Linker does is look at the objects, functions and modules involved in a scenario, and try to weave the fast paths together so that little dynamism is left; i.e., it ties “objects” together with a native code “thread.”  That napkin drawing looked awfully like a ball of twine, we needed a name, and it seemed to be the only domain on the Internet which had not been judiciously “parked.”",1241430980

Microsoft could bring Windows Mobile (the mobile OS that pretty much everyone, including Windows fans, agrees sucks) to Atom ""easily"".  But could it bring Vista or Windows 7 or even XP?  Probably not easily, and probably not cheaply enough for Microsoft to consider it worth doing, since it would cannibalize their higher margin full laptop and desktop license sales.  Linux, on the other hand, can be on these devices easily, in the form of Android, or one of the netbook targeted full-featured distros.  The innovator's dilemma strikes again.",1241430547

592144,comment,592043,592043,0,0,snprbob86,,,"This reminds me of a story I recently heard from my friend, a fitness nut. He recently coached a middle school girls soccer team for some odd reason. They weren't the best players in the world to say the least. He said that they tried all sorts of excuses to get out of playing, but he was too quick witted and the girls came to enjoy his sense of humor while simultaneously fearing mild humiliation.<p>He was upfront with these girls, telling them that they didn't stand a chance against the more experienced teams unless they were better conditioned. Every time any one of them failed, they all ran a punishment lap together. Every time they succeeded, they ran a victory lap together. Every time one of them couldn't keep up, they did another lap to have an opportunity to succeed together. He ran every lap with them. They spent far more time running than playing soccer; they came to enjoy it.<p>The team won second place in the division. A significant portion of their victories were record comebacks because the opposing teams simply couldn't keep up the momentum. They were beaten only by a team who was both well conditioned and technically strong, but it was a close match.",1241428529

At best I might use the trend graphs as an starting point from which to interrogate the qualitative data (comments).<p>One major problem is the need to click through to the detail page to see these charts, this doesn't lend itself to easy decision making on the fly.  However, the real issue is that even when you do click through, it doesn't show probably another important metric by which to judge: volume of votes over time.  If you were to add that into the equation and suddenly the user has 3 charts per venue to interrogate to establish the reliability of the initial score out of 5.<p>I think that's a reasonably big ask for someone who just wants to know where's to get a decent Kung Pao chicken around here.",1241428347

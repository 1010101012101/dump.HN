If all goes well, it should then bloom into full research partnership towards the end and after. But again, that's the ideal.<p>As others have said already, your field matters a lot. If you try to publish in a ""softer"" field, say history or economics, politics and outer markers count for a lot. If you are in mathematics, there should be zero problem if you are good. Alternatively, if you are in a field where success can be measured concretely, say in engineering, you should also have less difficulties. Good luck, whether you go for PhD or not!",1242712546

In some countries your thesis actually consists of submitting these papers that you have published to a research committee in order to <i>get</i> a PhD.<p>If you believe you can make a genuine contribution to a field, you need to pick a candidate publication, read it to understand its style convention, follow the ""Instructions to Authors"" religiously and pay the page charges (where appropriate). In your paper you need to link what you present to research that has been published before - think of science as case law - it builds up iteratively. By basing your work on previously peer-reviewed publications you are helping your reviewers see that you are working on solid ground.<p>Most editors will screen arrant nonsense (""I can prove Einstein was wrong""), but are likely to pass reasonable material to a review panel irrespective of any qualifications of the authors.<p>The real question is why you would want to. Generally being published in a peer-reviewed journal is only of real value to academics, because they are rated depending on their publication and citation rates. Otherwise, if you can anything interesting to say you can just publish it on a paper server (eg. arXiv as mentioned in another comment).",1242711814

Part of the solution was just caring less what other people think, and mentioning to them only the pretty/nifty/cool/engaging things that I work on, not the theoretical stuff.<p>Another good tip is that, with some time and effort, you can largely shape the kind of new friends you meet, especially today with the web. You could organise some informal gettogethers, interest groups, lectures, etc. Providing free beer helps a lot. Leverage your workplace, your school, your local watering hole. Hunt for people who are doing the same things you do. Blog about what you do, so others can find it. These days, you can automate a lot of this just by setting up search feeds on Google, Twitter, etc. Even on something as noisy as Twitter, there's someone talking about fluid dynamics, linguistics, philosophy, etc. Find them, see what places they link to, and join their communities so you can find out where they hang out in real life. The trick is to not treat the online world as a separate place where the ""cool people hang out"", but simply the medium through which ""cool people hook up"". Most of the people you want to hang out with are in the same boat as you: bored, alone and online.<p>The fact is that you are less likely to meet someone truly interested in your pursuits than just regular 'nice people'. Accept this, but make sure you are ready to encounter these special people and show them, very quickly, that you are a smart person worth getting to know and worth having in depth conversations with.<p>Also, though the hacker lifestyle has its perks, it never hurts to expand your interests to include more outdoor activities. Often you can be as intellectual and nerdy about those as you want, without suffering the nerd penalty.<p>As for correcting people on urban legends: people don't like being told they're wrong and many people enjoy urban legends for the drama and excitement, because it gives them a story to tell.

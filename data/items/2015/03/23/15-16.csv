However, for the benefit of others, I think I&#x27;ll just ask you a few questions that would be good to know if I were looking for an investment.<p>1. How much are you looking to invest? I hope you won&#x27;t answer that &quot;This depends on the business, the model, the founders, how much market share there is, and what percentage of the business I will receive.&quot; Those are all important details. But what range of cash on hand do you have. $5000 - $10,000 is far different from $500,000 to $1,000,000.<p>2. How many other startups are you currently invested in? What is their current market capitalization? What is your net valuation of these businesses? I understand you probably can&#x27;t give names, and that&#x27;s ok that will come up in due diligence, but a general idea would be nice.<p>3. You would like to take a business development role to scale the business. What is your experience in this previously or currently? Can you give us some idea of your track record and success rate?<p>4. You are an engineer, a product manager, and an entrepreneur. Can you please give us an example of one of your startups which is either still running or has been sold?<p>I am not trying to give you a hard time.

Sure, they don&#x27;t need a lot of juice so a tiny patch of solar could power them. BUT there&#x27;s 2 problems: These panels work on UV and infrared. Unless your phone owner spends a lot of time outdoors, he won&#x27;t be exposing his phone to that kind of radiation, neither of which is found (significantly) indoors. Second, where do people carry their phones? Where the sun doesn&#x27;t shine - I&#x27;m referring to their pockets, of course.<p>I wonder about the efficiency of window panes on buildings too: UV and infrared are in short supply when the sky is overcast, whereas visible doesn&#x27;t dip nearly as much.

My point on petroleum was just to say I derive some of my lively hood from commodity markets based on trading Crude, NGLS, Ethanol, and some other things like metals, coal, etc. Even though this is the case, I still am a huge proponent for solar! However, we need to focus on a systematic cheapening of solar output per dollar for mainstream use, not clear solar panels that don&#x27;t even make use of the most powerful spectrum of light.(even so I am still mostly in favor of this research)<p>Which brings me to my second point and why I disagree on plant based plastics. Oil is way cheaper to make plastics with than any other organic element. Further when you devote arable land to something other than food there is always going to be market pressure that will drive up food prices. I have enough experience in commodity markets to know that ethanol is a losing proposition right now. If we stop making oil based plastics we are going to run into the same issues with unnatural subsidies propping up the market. I do wish that we could just stop pulling oil out of the ground and use our plant waste to make all the plastic we currently use, but it just isn&#x27;t the case.

If you&#x27;ve found yourself in an irreplaceable role in a company, you&#x27;ve got incompetent management. If all you have to offer is your skill and time, you can be replaced.<p>The point is that in negotiations, you are at a disadvantage solely because you are an individual. Your class states that employers expect to pay you between X dollars and Y dollars with some wiggle room.<p>As a class, your median wage should be higher given the productivity increases and profits yielded by the industry in the past 30 years.<p>If you excel, you still have a higher base from which to negotiate from.<p>> However, just because there is no extra industry in your area should not mean that the existing ones should be muscled by unions to make up the difference. And it is very un-realistic to expect that.<p>No one is muscled into anything. Employers freely choose to enter contracts with unions. The issue is that some employers do not want to make good on the stipulations they agreed to.<p>It&#x27;s unrealistic to think that labor should remain divided to be conquered, as the tides in the past pushed for organized labor until it was neutered by legislation.<p>>I have still not heard a good argument in this entire discussion thread as to why that is evil (it is just assumed to be) and why more is not expected of the employee in the negotiation. It just seems very fashionable, right now, to think of companies as inherently evil.<p>Things that are negotiable on a individual level are left up to the employee to suss out of their employer. Bonuses, supplementary pay, extra time off are usually up to you to negotiate.<p>Items that are negotiable on a class level are left to unions. Base pay for employees, working conditions, employee benefits etc are not individually negotiable. No organization is going to bend over backwards for one employee at the bottom of the totem pole.<p>It takes a group of people (the corporation) to provide those basic niceties and it takes a group of people (the union) to advocate and use its weight in negotiation to ensure their members are provided with them.",1427124811

Their leaders often enjoy genuine popularity – at least after eliminating any plausible rivals. State propaganda aims not to ‘engineer human souls’ but to boost the dictator’s ratings.

I get that some people still probably mess this up, but there&#x27;s no excuse to do so at this point.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what it would even mean for this to not be broken in a one-page app. If you&#x27;re displaying more than one conceptually grouped set of content on one page, you&#x27;re breaking the web&#x27;s concept of a page: a page is one conceptually grouped set of content. JS MVC frameworks allow you to back and forward between &quot;pages&quot; within a page using the hashed href trick, but they can&#x27;t keep your scroll location without rendering the page to determine layout, unless there&#x27;s some magic I&#x27;m not aware of.<p>> 3.

I&#x27;m not sure what you think authentication does when your JavaScript is running in the same namespace as all the other JavaScript in a page and malicious code needs simply to tell authenticated code what to do to spoof an identity. A server can do nothing to provide security when the requests from a browser are coming from an authenticated user (but are actually made by malicious JavaScript in the page).<p>Plenty of apps include advertisements from arbitrary sources, hence loading content from a server that isn&#x27;t yours.",1427123572

Shortly after, the first frame was made. Since then, the evolution of photography has continued and brought to us some different variants of photo devices.\nWe live in a new progressive millennium – everything around us is growing and innovating. In our opinion, photo frame design should be both technically innovative and fashionable. \nInspired by revolutionary photo technology, we created the perfect gift for someone special in your life.\nTRIVOLTY is the first LED-light CRYSTAL with laser engraved photo from your iPad, iPhone, camera, tablet, laptop or any other device. \nTRIVOLTY is not just a souvenir but it&#x27;s an awesome service where anyone can upload an image and immediately assess how it looks in the real crystal in few minutes on our website.

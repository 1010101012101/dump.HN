You have a first class suite of tools with Emacs + SLIME + Paredit. You have native deployment on multiple platforms to boot. Can&#x27;t go wrong.<p>If you prefer static typing I&#x27;d choose C++ over Go. Good old C++ may not be the flavor of the week but it is almost as dummy-easy as Java if you use smart pointers and RAII. It has excellent generics support, something sadly missing from Go. Great mutli-platform native deployment.",1375451997

6146812,comment,6146208,6146208,2,0,JohnTHaller,,,"For the curious, this is an optional program at SourceForge being offered to developers as a way to monetize their work.  The developer needs to specifically request it.  SourceForge gets a cut, so does the developer.  The installer is their first stab at this process and is using the bundling technology from Ask.com. As offer-based installers go, this one is about as good as it gets.  It makes a single offer and has an Accept and Decline button with the user selecting whichever one they want (not a pre-checked box accepting the offer above a Next/Continue button).  If accepted, the installer installs the offered software and it gets a standard entry in Windows&#x27; Add/Remove Programs that works as expected.  If declined, the installer continues.  The installer then downloads the originally-requested software.<p>The two issues with the current installer are that (1) it is served in place of the requested file with no indication that a substitution is made as the user downloads and (2) it requests admin rights before it starts downloading the software, which can be a security issue.  Roberto (who posted the article) has stated that they are working on #1 in terms of the text shown on SourceForge as you select to download and download.  As for #2, there may be some ways to rework the installer so this is not an issue.  I&#x27;ll mention it to him when I speak to him.<p>SourceForge has one other revenue-share program with developers where you place the SourceForge-branded download buttons on your own website that link to your downloads on SourceForge and you get a small cut of the ad revenue made from the download page.<p>If I recall correctly, SourceForge has been losing money for a few years now.  Dice Holdings picked up SourceForge and Slashdot while Geek.com kept ThinkGeek.com, so they are now separate entities.  These new experiments are attempts to get SourceForge to be self-sustaining/profitable.  Ad revenue alone likely won&#x27;t cut it.<p>Unfortunately, Google Code, Github and others don&#x27;t offer the full breadth of services that SourceForge does for open source projects.  Google Code, Github, and others have all ditched binary downloads, so SourceForge is one of the only providers to make binary downloads available to Windows and Mac user at no charge.  This is why SourceForge is popular for real apps (FileZilla, Pidgin, PortableApps.com, etc) and Github is popular for components (node.js, jquery, rails, etc). The code zips available at other providers are of no use to end users.<p>As full disclosure, I run PortableApps.com, one of SourceForge&#x27;s largest projects pushing quite a few TBs of downloads through their mirror network.  We make use of the SF-branded download buttons revenue share program but do not make use of nor have any plans to use the &quot;enhanced&quot; installers.  Everything I&#x27;ve discussed here is already publicly available, I just thought it would be handy to have in one place.",1375451138

Who you were at 17 means nothing. If you&#x27;re 40 years old and still have to mention that you went to an Ivy League school, that&#x27;s not a good thing.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter. No one knows who you are. The good news is that you don&#x27;t have to fear embarrassment. When you&#x27;re &quot;the smart kid&quot; you can&#x27;t afford to look stupid. Now, you can. The world is built by ex-smart-kids who weren&#x27;t afraid to look stupid.<p><i>I make $130k as a 21 year old and I probably put in 3 hours of real work a day.</i><p>Also irrelevant. I think it might be part of your problem. Forget precociousness and all that golden child bullshit, because any job that pays a 21-year-old (excluding overt nepotism/connections) that much money is going to be stressful as fuck (and, as I&#x27;ll explain, I think cumulative stress is part of your problem). I think you might want to be moving away from the high-stress jobs. If you actually want achievements that you can be proud of, you won&#x27;t get them in the high-stress professional gigs; you&#x27;re better off downshifting to the middling level where you&#x27;re still surrounded by smart people but no one&#x27;s gunning to be a millionaire in 5 years.<p><i>I think people are starting to realize that I&#x27;m a bit slower than I could be.</i><p>&quot;People&quot; are just as insecure as you are. They&#x27;re mostly focused on their own survival and advancement-- not sizing you up. They probably don&#x27;t think about you at all. If you stay out of their way, their evaluations (except for management) of you don&#x27;t matter at all. People won&#x27;t fuck with you just because you&#x27;re working below your potential; almost <i>everyone</i> is working below capacity. As long as it doesn&#x27;t mess up their shit, no one will fuck with you.<p>What you have is <i>impostor syndrome</i>, meaning that you think you&#x27;re worse than you actually are. The dirty secret of adult life is people are just making it up as they go along. You&#x27;re not the only one who feels &quot;fake&quot;, and the people who seem to have their shit together are just as shaky as you are.<p><i>I secretly spend 7-8 hours a day doing bullshit at work (reading online, games, etc).</i><p>Not uncommon. Don&#x27;t feel guilty. Don&#x27;t try to stop per se, so much as you should be <i>replacing</i> less useful activities with better ones. If you say, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to [X]&quot; you&#x27;re setting yourself up for temptation. Better to find things that interest you more. Maybe you could learn new technical skills on the job. (Do your building-- that is, things where you need to own the IP-- on your own time and resources though.)<p>Your work environment is probably partly at fault, too. You probably spend so much time on bullshit because you can&#x27;t get in the zone with all the distractions and interruptions and petty social anxieties that rule the day. You&#x27;ve probably noticed that people who actually want to get things done at work either (a) show up early, (b) stay late, or (c) spend a substantial amount of time outside of the office. Very little gets done in core working hours in the typical office, because most people are at 100% CPU on reputation management bullshit.<p>Here&#x27;s something you probably haven&#x27;t been told about the adult world. The reason most people hate going to work isn&#x27;t the work itself. It&#x27;s all the pointless social anxiety generated by cramped offices, interruptions, the constant need to modulate social status to precisely half a notch below one&#x27;s manager, et al. People enjoy work itself; it&#x27;s a deep-seated psychological need to feel useful and productive. It&#x27;s <i>being at work</i> that gets them down, because full-time social climbing isn&#x27;t natural or appealing to most people. The best way to become happier at work, perhaps surprisingly, is to work harder. That&#x27;s not a platitude, though; it&#x27;s hard advice to follow because you&#x27;ll actually need something that motivates you to work hard.<p><i>I know that I&#x27;ve been given a gift and that I&#x27;m a fucking idiot for wasting it, but I&#x27;ve just become a chronic procrastinator and it sucks.</i><p>A very large number of people feel this way. One of the problems with Work in most jobs is that it conditions people to associate productive activity with subordination.<p>You&#x27;re not a fuckup, but you&#x27;ve been poisoned with bad conditioning. It&#x27;s not about &quot;willpower&quot; as some immutable trait of a person. It&#x27;s about the fact that we&#x27;re animals that respond strongly to our environment, rewards, and punishments. (See: Stanford Prison Experiment.) There&#x27;s no point in feeling shame about this; it&#x27;s just how our bodies and brains work.<p><i>I could be changing the world but instead I&#x27;m putting in the bare minimum</i><p>You&#x27;re not ready to &quot;change the world&quot;. You have to improve yourself first. I won&#x27;t lie; it takes time.<p>Spin up a side project. Or replace your at-work videogaming with Coursera. Or take more responsibility at work. Try to move to another team. Just do <i>something</i> where there will be meaningful feedback from the world. What&#x27;s the worst that can happen? If you get fired, it&#x27;s still better to lose a job while on an upswing than when comfortable (the shock of getting fired while comfortable takes months to recover from; but if you get fired while you&#x27;re actively working hard, it&#x27;s much easier to bounce back).<p><i>Any advice on how you taught yourself to focus on tasks, build willpower, and get shit done would be helpful.</i><p>Just try to make each day better than the last. Install RescueTime. Don&#x27;t expect miracles. Just work toward incremental improvements. Again, each day better than the last.<p><i>Although, I wonder if I really fucked my brain/habits up so much that I&#x27;ll never reach my full capacity.</i><p>Unlikely. You can build new habits in a couple of months, and unless you were using a lot of drugs, you&#x27;ll be fine.<p>Most likely, what has addled your brain is low-level but chronic social stress from the workplace. That shit sucks, but the good news is that it only takes about a month to recover (once you get to a better work environment). Practice meditation to build up your resolve (and don&#x27;t expect results quickly; the contemplative path is a lifelong one).<p>By the way, &quot;full capacity&quot; is unattainable. You need down time. You need to spend <i>some</i> of your time playing video games and watching TV. Just focus on quality. I generally allow time for one high-quality TV show (e.g. Breaking Bad) but I sure as hell am not going to let myself spend 4 hours per day watching it.<p><i>My dad is also very similar in that he&#x27;s smart enough to bullshit through life but he only works at 10-20% of his full capacity and he never completes anything.</i><p>Don&#x27;t worry about your parents. Just focus on yourself. One of the most important subtasks of recovering your emotional health is to stop dwelling on details irrelevant to the task at hand. Observe, but never stew.

One way large corporations structure the work is deliverables based.  That means the company is paying the vendor to deliver design docs, code, tests, etc. on a schedule and aren&#x27;t necessarily paying per hour.  The offshore companies hire a couple of Java enterprise developers with 6 months experience and don&#x27;t pay them much.  They assemble the basics of an application together and the work is billed out as $X,000 for development.  The cost for development seems inexpensive for a large corporation where if they staffed someone themselves, that would be less than 1 month and there&#x27;s certainly no way 1 person could write an entire app in a month (that should be in sarcasm font - but that is how upper mgmt thinks).<p>The offshore companies profit lies between what they pay people and what they charge the mega-corp.  Some offshore companies cut corners in this area - so you will hear things like &quot;they only did the minimum&quot;, &quot;they can&#x27;t think out of the box&quot;, etc.  This is likely because the developers have too many projects and really aren&#x27;t encouraged to go above and beyond since that will not help the profit margin.<p>A lot of the offshore companies have attrition problems as well which help contribute to the stereotype that developers from those countries are unskilled or cheap.<p>From your writing on your blog, you are a better writer than what I&#x27;ve seen coming from some companies in my day job.

Needless to say, thats not good for business and causes both parties a fair deal of distress.<p>Some things Im doing to conquer my shortcomings:<p>I outline the entire project and try to estimate how long it will take. I then schedule the work on hours I try to keep myself to (4-5 hours a day). Once working on the project,  I log my working hours and what I do with them. Once the project is done, I review my outline and time sheets to see how close I was to my estimates, and where I went wrong (usually I was distracted or needed to learn new tech to get the work done). I use OmniPlan on iPad to do all of this[1].<p>I usually work on several projects at once. Ive found out that I really can&#x27;t focus on more than three at a time, so Im learning to say no to new projects or schedule them far in the future. In truth, I still have ten projects right now, but half of them are longer term.<p>Starting my day by reviewing the projects in OmniPlan and seeing what needs attention most helps me get started on them. I also have a desktop picture with the Yogi Bhajan quote When the time is on you, start and the pressure will be off.. When I read it and fully realize it, that motivates me to get started. And lastly, I use a GTD trick when working on a project that seems too big or boring: I pick the smallest, most fun part of a project, and tell myself that Ill take a break after that.

Can&#x27;t remember) saying these archers had to be able to loose three arrows in 1.5 seconds.<p>Also, he makes a case for close-quarters combat. I think possibly he&#x27;s studied this stuff more than you have?

Shooting at people five or ten feet away is suicide.  Even if you hit them through the chest, they will live long enough to get you back.  Only in hollywood do targets ever fall down dead when hit with arrows.<p>(3) The &quot;ancient&quot; archery this guy idolizes never existed.  Arrows made from natural substances (wood, bone etc) are not this accurate.  Ancient hunters shot very close to animals, so close that they did worry about the animal turning on them (see 2 above).  In war, using indirect fire to cover distance, archers always fired en mass.  They also drilled to create consistent trajectories in order to concentrate fire.  They did not aim at specific targets.<p>(4) Leveling an arrow on the left of the riser (bow) doesn&#x27;t require more movements than on right.  The arrow is drawn by passing the pointy bit through the bow, between the string and riser, and then drawing it back.  One motion, never letting go of the arrow.  This is how I was taught to shoot fingers.  As for holding extra arrows in your bow hand, this is certainly possible, but you better be careful when pulling them through a closed fists.

Which in turn depends on heuristics that V8 uses. These heuristics are slightly different in newer V8. As a result of these changes V8 hits <i>inner</i> loop instead of <i>outer</i> loop. This leads to worse code.<p>Code that benefits from OSR is the code that contains a loop which a) can be well optimized b) runs long b) is run only few times in total. The Sieve benchmark is opposite of this and as a result it doesn&#x27;t benefit from OSR - you get bigger penalty from producing worse code and no benefit from optimizing slightly earlier.<p>Not using OSR for Sieve also hides the other issue with mortality of typed array&#x27;s hidden classes. I say &quot;hides&quot; not &quot;fixes&quot; because one can easily construct a benchmark where the mortality would still be an observable performance issue even if benchmark itself is run without an OSR: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/mraleph/2942a14ef2a480e2a7a9"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/mraleph/2942a14ef2a480e2a7a9</a>",1422042225

8936719,comment,8934298,8936184,0,0,adamtj,,,"It sounds like maybe you don&#x27;t understand the concepts.<p>Of course you&#x27;re right that most people don&#x27;t need to know exactly how encryption algorithms work.  But, <i>everybody</i> needs to know what they do -- and what they don&#x27;t do!  That&#x27;s a deeper level understanding than simply knowing if they&#x27;re &quot;secure&quot; or not.<p>For example, too many people think that encryption gives you security.  It does not.  Encryption can provide confidentiality, but only if you also have integrity and authentication.  Those three things are just the beginning of security.<p>One of the implications is that if you&#x27;re using a self-signed certificate for HTTPS, you might as well not bother encrypting.  If you don&#x27;t reject a certificate lacking a verified signature, then you can&#x27;t know that you aren&#x27;t talking to a MITM instead of the server you think you&#x27;re accessing.  A MITM can trivially decrypt all your data, so why bother encrypting in the first place if you don&#x27;t verify certs?  Too many people ignore the certificates because they don&#x27;t understand what encryption really gets them.<p>Many people also discount that danger because they don&#x27;t understand how trivially easy MITM attacks can be.  ARP spoofing is not hard.  Some networking equipment is getting better at preventing it, but you can&#x27;t always count on it.  In short, it&#x27;s best to assume that anybody else with a laptop in your local coffee shop can see _and modify_ all network packets you send.  They don&#x27;t necessarily have to break the wireless encryption to see them, either, so that won&#x27;t keep you safe.",1422041248

8936715,comment,8936382,8936382,0,0,kw71,,,"This article is one-sided and shortsighted.  There are many reasons why engine controls must include anti-tampering measures.  There is a business case to extend these principles to other control modules in a car.  Disclosure: I&#x27;ve been an automotive DMCA violator for nearly a decade.<p>An obvious reason is that the manufacturers do not want to deal with warranty issues.  Of course you can probably understand that the possibility is there that bad software can result in engine damage.  This applies to other systems, too, for instance the guy who demonstrated that he could alternately flash his headlamps like a police car by sending traffic to the lamp controller probably does not realize that he should not be reigniting the HID lamp every couple of seconds, because this will shorten its life.<p>The automakers are liable to laws in every developed country.  The United States has these average fuel economy laws that the carmakers must meet, and in some states, harsh emissions regulations must be adhered to and guaranteed.  The emissions testing regime in some of these states has done away with exhaust gas analysis and relies on the engine control&#x27;s self-diagnosis to show that the vehicle is performing to spec.<p>However in other countries, increasing pollution emitted by a car constitutes tax fraud.<p>Road safety is also important.  One German carmaker uses the same diesel engine for a range of vehicles which have differing performance levels.  I thought it was clever when I found that you could change the low market six cylinder from a cheap model to give the power output of the top model of the range simply by carefully changing eeprom data.  But the low market model has a lame exhaust and small brakes.  Triple the engine output power and this is potentially a disaster.<p>For as long as the universe of tinkerers will include those without experience or scruples, the carmakers will have to keep developing anti-tampering measures to show that they are attempting to guarantee that their products will perform within the bounds of the law, and indemnify them against bogus liability and warranty claims.  Some tinkerers are smart enough to see the big picture and think about the results of what they are doing.  Others either don&#x27;t realize that these systems were designed by teams of engineers with more degrees and experience than them, or figure that they can sell genitalia enhancements to any twentysomething that walks in the door.  These are the guys that scare me.",1422041216

To pass the tests, it must follow the ideal surface with an error less than lambda/4, where lambda is the wavelength of visible light. In practice, that&#x27;s 0.1 microns or less. Also, the density of scratches and pits must be very low (not detectable by usual means).<p>It&#x27;s totally doable by hand, working in your garage, on a piece of glass the size of a dinner plate. It just takes a very, very long time, at least on first attempt. My first telescope took over a year (admittedly, I took too many breaks, and then I did a lot of experiments with the techniques).<p><a href=""http://florin.myip.org/blog/150-mm-f8-mirror-25-mm-pyrex-polishing-and-figuring-log"" rel=""nofollow"">http://florin.myip.org/blog/150-mm-f8-mirror-25-mm-pyrex-pol...</a>",1422039844

You are not likely to be one of them. But if <i>everybody</i>, especially the innocent, takes practical defensive measures then taking defensive measures is no longer evidence of anything. It&#x27;s like encouraging people to use Tor to check sports scores and read Wikipedia.<p>And <i>because</i> you&#x27;re innocent, whatever legal consequences may currently be the result of defending yourself are irrelevant to you with high probability because they only come into play if you are already a target. And since that is very unlikely to occur, and if it does you&#x27;re basically already screwed anyway, discouraging people from doing something that allows the innocent actual targets to claim a stronger defense is probably not in the public interest.",1422039815

What comes to mind as the first thing that would happen as a result of this?<p>Most women are smaller than the men that hit on them, and are constantly told they need to be vigilant against assault (this is a consequence of victim-blaming, which is wrongheaded, but nonetheless psychologically influencial). A woman saying &quot;I&#x27;m not interested&quot; is directly rejecting the man hitting on them, and only for her own reasons. I know people who have been slapped because they rejected someone openly. In a situation that wasn&#x27;t a crowded environment (for example, if a woman is being harassed on a street) things could easily go worse.<p>On the other hand, if the woman says &quot;Sorry, I have a boyfriend,&quot; the implication is that she <i>would</i> sleep with him, he&#x27;s <i>so</i> attractive, but sorry, another man already owns her. Men respect men far more than they respect women. I am not a physically intimidating man, but I can defuse situations between aggressive men in clubs hitting on my women friends quite easily by claiming to be their boyfriend.<p>This has nothing to do with politeness and, like many interactions between women and men, everything to do with survival.",1422039703

It was meant to be fun project, ideally to make a little money. http://www.bestoftheinternets.com/<p>When I started in 2011, I didn&#x27;t know much about programming and or SEO, I used twitter to draw traffic. I have made improvements and kind of used it as I&#x27;m also not the best designer...<p>As of right now, the website pulls videos from Youtube API, iphone apps (apple api) and funny or die videos, makes a page for them and then shoots out an tweet about the video. The tweet is sent out to one of my 100 of twitters accounts. I get about 150 clicks a day and have a least half a million videos/pages. In addition I have slowly built some SEO credibility. Tweets and videos go out 24 hours a day and I built twitter trending algorithm as well.<p>For a while I was making decent money on adsense, until google shut me down for auto generated content. Since that time I have tried linkshare, chiquta, conjunction junction, amazon, and yesadvertising (<--- they are the worst). But I have failed to generate any significant revenue.<p>The overriding goal has been to make some money and at the same time organize youtube videos and iphone apps based on popularity. Basically, allow an end user to waste time on the internets or to see what is trending. (I completely understand that I&#x27;m not revolutionizing the internet, or making social more personable or solving world problems...)<p>I&#x27;m trying to figure out a way to make this sight more profitable.

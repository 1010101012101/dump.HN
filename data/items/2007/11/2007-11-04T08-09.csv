What other non-obvious (Facebook, Google, Amazon) companies do you guys know of that are tech-open-minded?",1194165341

The e-mail system (GMail and domain services) aren't competing with MS Outlook, they're competing with MS Exchange and hence with Windows Server. That's one hell of a market. If Google sets themselves up as the strongest ""utility provider"" with respect to IT, and it looks like they're the only ones that ""get it"" as an organization at this point, I'm wondering why Google's stock price is so freaking low...<p>Googling ""information technology utility"" points me towards a more articulate explanation of the concept at MITSloan:<p><a href=""http://sloanreview.mit.edu/smr/issue/2005/spring/13/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sloanreview.mit.edu/smr/issue/2005/spring/13/</a>",1194164801

75996,comment,75644,75859,0,0,andreyf,,,"Are you being sarcastic?<p><i>This strategy of getting start-ups to explain their business models and share their technologies...</i><p>This kind of accusation seems so childish. Of course Google can start a competing service, and looking into possible acquisitions instead seems like a sensible thing to do before starting one. But Google's goog411 has nothing to do with the Free411 business model - they aren't trying to sell ads, they are gathering speech data. If Free411 had an enormous database of voice samples, goog411 might have never been. Just because Google didn't consider Free411.com a valuable acquisition doesn't make them evil.",1194164063

If your net worth is high, you get little extra benefit for doubling it. <p>So I'd say $100k, just off the top of my head. Seems like risking 95 to win 100 is pretty good, not to mention it's trivial to get there.",1194163741

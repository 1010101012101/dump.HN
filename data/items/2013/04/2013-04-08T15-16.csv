It is ridiculous and degrading to expect a parent to physically cover their childrens' eyes during the violent parts of _Alex Cross_. These people didn't sign up for a PG13 movie viewing experience, they signed up for a flight.<p>Rob Cohen, the director, corroborates:<p>""When I read your piece this morning, I felt extremely sympathetic to the family involved and, in some ways, quite apologetic. I never made the film to cause anyone this kind of discomfort. It seems to me they (the family) were well within their rights to request some control as to what their two young children were exposed. As a father of five year old triplets, I, too, would not want them to absorb some of the images we created for my film.... PG-13 should mean what it does at the box office, at the very least meaning no one under 13 should be exposed to it. If the airlines cannot accommodate a more flexible presentation giving seats the option of viewing or not, they shouldn't show the film unless it meets what we could call ""general cabin"" suitability.""",1365436751

5512485,comment,5511863,5511863,11,0,js2,,,"Git commands are not consistent. This is a result of it growing organically, and having a maintainer who strongly values backwards compatibility. But you know, having used git for years that doesn't bother me. Let me explain.<p>Git is conceptually straightforward[1]. It is difficult if not impossible to discern those concepts from its baroque CLI. So learning git from its built-in help and/or man pages is suboptimal if not a complete waste of time. Either read the Pro Git book[2] or pop the hood[3]. Then the inconsistent CLI is no longer a big deal. If it were, someone would have come up with a new porcelain (high-level CLI) that would have taken hold by now. And no one really has. There is Easy Git[4] but I don't know anyone who uses it.<p>And really, I see git as not much different than Unix in this regard. Unix commands vary widely in their usage. Does knowing awk help with sed? cpio and tar? wget vs curl? Eventually you understand concepts such as pipes, regular expressions, file descriptors, etc and you become familiar with the commands where you are able to apply these concepts, at which point does strict interface consistency between them matter? I dunno, but I started with both git and hg around the same time and ended up happier with git. Mercurial had the ""better"" CLI, but I found git was better at doing what I wanted. Before that I used clearcase, which has a very consistent CLI and yet I was constantly cursing at it.<p>Or maybe I just have stockholm syndrome and I'd feel differently if I'd ever used plan 9. :)<p>1. <a href=""http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.htm...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://git-scm.com/book"" rel=""nofollow"">http://git-scm.com/book</a><p>3. <a href=""http://newartisans.com/2008/04/git-from-the-bottom-up/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newartisans.com/2008/04/git-from-the-bottom-up/</a><p>4. <a href=""http://people.gnome.org/~newren/eg/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.gnome.org/~newren/eg/</a>",1365436699

A ""factory farm"" with 10,000 cows is obviously going to supply more milk than 999 other farms with 100 cows, if we can assume, for argument's sake, a constant output from each animal. The farms with 100 cows in that example are much more prevalent by a wide margin though. If I recall correctly, the average herd size for a dairy farm is somewhere around 40 cows.<p>pyre, in the post I responded to, suggested that even free range farms that put focus on animal care were not providing sufficient care for animals, leaving them still tightly packed and stressed. And maybe that is true, but I am still left wondering how we measure which farms are providing sufficient care?

You need to observe the person you're dealing with before making a move, and see what their perception of their own power is, how they balance emotion with logic, and take a guess as to the most effective form of getting your point across.<p>Here's a personal story (and sure, it <i>could</i> be an exception): I love martial-arts-weapons. I'm trained with the rope dart, meteor hammer, chain whip, twin hooks, etc. Anyway, I've been trying to learn the butterfly knife/balisong. Since they're illegal in Canada, I bought a practice balisong, which looks like a real knife, but just has a dull blade with holes in it so it can't be sharpened. I completely forgot I had it in my carry-on bag.<p>Security stopped me, several officers (airport security and police, if I'm not mistaken) gathered around after they closed off the line. I could easily have been polite here, and got myself kicked out or arrested. I could've said, ""Sir, I know you're just doing your job, but this is perfectly legal and I have every right to keep it. As you can see, it isn't sharp."" I could've gone on to quote my civil liberties, and explain how no one could mistake it for a real knife because it has holes. It'd be hard to argue that this wasn't polite--but really, where would it have gotten me?<p>Instead, I took deep exaggerated sigh, put my hands over my face and said ""I'm so sorry--I completely forgot!"" I explained exactly what it was for, and added on, ""it's for tricks only"". After showing them how to open it and proving it was blunt, I asked for it, and showed them a few tricks. Again, I apologized and explained how I never meant to bring it. A few well-placed smiles later, the security offered to mail it to my home address, and let me pass without any issues.<p>So once again, being ""polite"" isn't the whole story.

Pension promises seemed like a cheap benefit to offer, and one that was mutually beneficial.<p>Couple this with mortality rates falling (expected lifetime increasing) and you have a bunc of completely unaffordable promises.  There is a very very good reason that final (and even career average) salary schemes are being phased out.<p>Companies have finally discovered just how expensive their promises are, and they are closing schemes as fast as they can get away with it.  The government, meanwhile, buries it's head in the sand because the taxpayer cannot go insolvent.  And even small changes to pension terms result in strikes.<p>The mathematics is pretty trivial for this rough estimate, but 30% of salary is low ballpark of the contributions required to meet obligations with a 95% probability over 40 years.

It's available in full on youtube for those interested.<p>Ultimately though, all talk of policy is a fools errand and utterly useless unless the overarching corruption in our political system is addressed. The free market dictates that companies can be expected to maximize their profits by whatever means necessary, and it's up to government to make sure ""whatever means necessary"" stays within an acceptable domain that protects key public interests. The primary requisite for the advancement of any civilization is it's resistance to corruption, and nothing short of a total overhaul will even put a dent on the decline we're experiencing. Until the era of pay-for-play and superPACS is brought to an end, legislation will always mold itself to induce the greatest profits for big corporations at the expense of every other interest.<p>EDIT: I should add as well though that the other side of this coin is that we as consumers CAN have a great influence outside of politics by voting with our dollars. If everyone refused to buy cheap Chinese goods and boycott Wal-Mart, enacting protectionist policies to protect American manufacturing wouldn't even be necessary. If we refused to put our money in banks involved in scandals or do business with their partners they'd soon be out of business. Alas, there in lies the other doom of the free market; as consumers we can be expected to act exactly in our own interests, which dictates buying the cheapest goods and most attractive deals regardless of the greater effects.

5512364,comment,5511815,5511815,11,0,jtbigwoo,,,"I can't agree with any of this article.<p>>> Its a problem because side projects create a talent bubble of people who arent fully engaged and are just doing enough at their ""real"" or full-time job to get by until their startup is up and running. This means their productivity suffers at their full-time job, an expense the employer ends up paying. The side project owners justify it by assuming it will only be for a short period of time.<p>Here's a surprising fact:  almost no one is ""fully engaged"" at work.  They're thinking about camping or football or shopping.  We don't owe our employers anything but our time and productivity.  At least if my coworker is working on a side project I know she's learning things that will make her better at her job.<p>>> And actually, we need to be honest. Not everyone is an entrepreneur. Part of being one is accepting the risk of starting your own company and taking the leap to be committed full time. Its not good for startups or for companies to have employees that are partially engaged in both and committed to neither.<p>Because side projects never succeed and full time startups never fail.  (Dell, Craigslist, Bingo Card Creator, Twitter, and Facebook.)<p>>> Heres a quick tip: there are plenty of those already. If you do want to start a company, work on building a real business, not a side idea thats hoping to be the next Twitter/Facebook/Instagram combination or a better version of Basecamp.<p>Says the guy whose companies include another Survey Monkey and yet another credit card payment app.  (Note: Chargify is a good product, but it's in a crowded market.)

If you look at the really impressive, sophisticated, polished JS/MVC apps (<a href=""http://backbonejs.org/#examples"" rel=""nofollow"">http://backbonejs.org/#examples</a>), you'll find that they're pretty much all using ""plain"" Backbone, without any of the meta-frameworks.

(The simple case just being one line of code to implement yourself, anyway).<p>* That not having <i>all</i> of your URLs available <i>all</i> of the time is an anti-pattern...<p>* That hiding and showing different parts of your app with simple CSS classes is usually less complex and faster than building up and then having to tear down large view hierarchies.<p>* That throwing away all of your models and views by <i>default</i> when a different route matches is actually the opposite of the approach you normally want to take -- at least if you're hoping to achieve a smooth app-like look and feel...<p>... you'll begin to understand that <i>you</i> are the person best equipped to design the data + UI architecture that best suits your app.",1365435241

There's no reason git shouldn't at <i>least</i> warn you on stderr here.<p>2. `git checkout -- somefile.py` does not have anything to do with checking out a revision.  It changes a file's contents, but doesn't change the parent of your working tree at all.  Unlike `git checkout -b` which is inconsistent for convenience like you mentioned, the ""make file x look like it was in rev y"" function here is unique to git checkout as far as I can tell.  Then again this <i>is</i> git, so there's probably at least four other ways to do this with cryptic plumbing commands.<p>3. I like Mercurial's named branches because I don't need to create a branch for every single commit.  But even if you don't like them, the ""record which branch X was made on"" and ""use that recorded information to group branches and such in the UI"" are two different things.  The second requires the first, but git <i>could</i> record which branch was checked out when each commit was made as some metadata in the commit, instead of dropping it on the floor.  It would be a godsend when trying to figure out what actually happened during a merge.<p>4. `git branch` doesn't show you the current branch.  It shows you all the local branches, with colors and padding spaces and asterisks and crap.  What if you want the current branch in your prompt?  Or just want to grab it in a script?  Your choices are ""pipe to grep and sed"" or ""use this ugly-ass rev-parse thing"" instead of ""git branch --current"".<p>Git's UI is still abysmal.  Mercurial preserves more data (branches), gives you the same power as Git and has a UI where ""--help x"", ""-h x"", ""help x"", ""x -h"", and ""x --help"" all do the same thing (pop quiz: how many different things does git do for those?  hint: it's more than two).",1365435098

They're informed customers, and don't need this kind of marketing.  The key points here was that they've gotten a bank to issue loans on the cars.

Yes, thank you Haskell. The best part about it too is the people contributing to that eco-system aren't <i>average</i> programmers, they are typically PhD holding industry programmers or academics (who contribute for free because there's no economic incentive to hide your work) that know far more than I do; all I have to do is be smart enough <i>to use what they build</i>.<p>On the topic of these ""engineering"" tools available for devs:<p>It's funny because engineering (if you can even call it that) for web applications only recently became a big juicy market [for engineers]. Most of the ""engineers"" were working on software for embedded systems or really big systems that were rarely ever end-user consumed as web applications are today. So tooling for engineers has actually been around; <i>very good tooling</i> in fact.<p>It's just that we now have a slew of people writing software in a very big market using languages that <i>ARE NOT SAFE</i> to program in! That's the story though, these languages {python | ruby | php | perl} are much easier to learn and ""get going"" in than something like Haskell, O'Caml, Mercury, Scala, Erlang, C++ &c... By being easier to pick up, [the languages] CREATED the market we are all now participating in. The downside though, is we have a sewer of code floating around because humans by nature, are terrible engineers. Our #1 priority SHOULD BE building tools to check and verify our end product. Some teams go so far as to have teams that are dedicated to writing that software and another team dedicated to writing the software that verifies the verification software! (this is typically when lives are at stake though - side-thought: with the bitcoin thefts and loss of identity on the net now though; one could argue that ""lives"" are at stake in an existential sense)<p>I consider Haskell itself to be top of the line tooling for engineerings - of all sorts, even web! Aside from the static analysis tools outside of the language, the language <i>itself</i> is a dream-come-true for real-world programmers such as myself.

Silence: you can't alias built-in commands  for good reason.  You don't change the defaults of commands, that's just going to cause problems with scripts.  Why is it ignored silently?  For starters because new git versions can add a command that would conflict with your config that came from an older version.  You can trivially see that an alias is ignored by just adding ``--help`` to the command and it won't show you the alias.<p>2. One Thing Well: I fail to see the problem with that?  All of these do the same thing.  They check out a revision.  With the exception of branch creation which is actually not a feature of `git checkout` but `git branch`.  There is just a convenience operation on `git checkout` that also changes branches.  The better question is why branches in mercurial are called bookmarks :P<p>3. Only the Gods: thankfully you don't know which branch something came from.  Mercurial fucked me over more than once where I accidentally pulled a patch that came from a named branch that was conflicting with one I already had (you would not believe how many people name their branches ""bugfix"").  Mercurial's named branches are among the stupidest idea in software maintenance.<p>4. The Hobgoblin: these are all different commands.  ""How can I view a list of all tags"": that's not what all tags is, that is ""what's the list of tags I know locally"".  In mercurial you can't even figure that out properly because depending on the branch you're on you get different defined tags since tags are stored in the tree.  Git's tag system is much superior to that.<p>""How can I view a list of all branches"": that's a question you will never ask because it's the wrong question.  A branch could show up multiple times.  The correct question to ask is ""How can I view a list of all local branches?"" `git branch`, the second question is ""how can I view a list of all remote branches?"" And for that the answer is `git branch -r` or `git branch --remote` which makes a lot of sense in my mind.<p>""And how can I view the current branch"": Same way you show all branches, just `git branch`.  Shows you your current branch as well as all other branches and neatly colorizes it.  `git rev-parse` is a command you really never have to use unless you script something.<p>Yeah, some could probably more consistent.  The odd one out are `git submodule` and `git remote` which are sub commands instead of using parameters to remove/modify them.  That being said, you rarely need to use those.<p>In direct comparison with hg, git's UI and functionality is a present from god.  I'm pretty sure hg only has a better UI reputation because git's UI used to be pretty bad.  Now however?  Pretty sure it wins over hg hands down.",1365434168

I did what they paid me to do, and if they had wanted more, they had the option to attempt to find a way to tap into the energy and drive I'm able to channel into something that actually matters.

That is how you know they were asking to see the captain without it explicitly saying, ""They demanded to see the captain.""<p>No, that is how you know they'd made a request that the flight attendant wasn't willing to answer. Whether that request is - as claimed in the article - for the captains name, or something else is not something we can know for sure, but the source does not provide any basis for your assumption that they asked to see the captain.<p>It is fairly amusing that you start your edit with ""Critical reading lesson here"" and go on to jump to totally unsubstantiated conclusions.<p>It is perfectly possible that this guy is lying through his teeth about the real reason, given that we only have one side of the store, but his reliability is a separate matter.<p>> At the very least, he asked the flight attendant to have a conversation with the guy flying the plane about a movie being shown in the back of the plane. On what planet is that a reasonable request???<p>On any planet where his subordinates claim not to have authority to make decisions affecting passengers about what is going on elsewhere in the plane.<p>Either the airline needs to delegate authority for matters like these, or they have to accept that customers will make requests for requests to be considered by the captain, whether or not the airline staff opts to ignore them<p>In any case this fantasy of the pilots as someone who needs to spend every second concentrating on keeping you in the air is of recent origin and has no basis in reality. There's not long history of planes falling out of the air because the pilot had to spend a few moments answering questions relayed through a staff of trained professionals who surely do know when they should not interrupt. For that matter, on my first flight as a 10 year old I was brought to the cabin and got to talk to the pilot, and that was normal at the time (1985). The only reason it isn't these days is fear of the passengers, not fear that the pilot might be unable to keep the plane up.<p>[edit:<p>> Additionally, I hope we can all agree that asking the flight attendant to speak with the captain about a movie playing is an unreasonable request.<p>No, we can't. As I described above, it is not unusual for the captain to deal with requests from the cabin crew, and if the airline does not believe the captain should deal with this type of request then they should delegate the responsibility to the purser. If nothing else this situation demonstrates that a cabin crew that is unable to make effective decisions on their own leads to undesirable situations that might very well have been avoided if authority had been properly delegated.<p>Further, even if we were to agree that it would be unreasonable for the flight attendant or purser to actually forward the request to the captain, I would not agree that it would be unreasonable for a passenger to <i>ask</i> when faced with a purser that claims to not have authority to consider his grievance, as long as said passenger did not then escalate things if told that it was against airline policy.<p>> Even more so, we can agree that diverting the plane for a person not getting up from their seat and not yelling or making threats is probably the wrong decision.<p>That, and the rest of your edit, we can agree about.",1365433496

The chart above shows corporate profits going through the roof but at the same time labour income is INCREASING.<p>The first chart shows labour income increasing over 1000% in forty years.

You'd rather have a clean drinking water rather than small pieces of green paper - it doesnt even burn very well. Money isnt valuable in its self, money is valued for the stuff it can buy.

To calculate average hashes per second of the network, we look at number of blocks solved in the last x unit of time (if you want a 24 hour average, take the number of blocks in the past 24 hours). As of the time of this post, 170 blocks have been solved in those 24 hours. This implies an expected 24*3.3e16 or 8e17 hashes have been computed. Divide by 86400 (seconds in a day) and you get 9.26e12, or 9.26 TH/s. The site reports 6.5 TH/s, presumably because it uses a longer window than 24 hours (probably 7 days).<p>Just because it's a statistical average instead of the exact rate doesn't mean it's 100% bogus. If you want, you can use fairly standard statistical models to find an acceptable error margin.",1365433266

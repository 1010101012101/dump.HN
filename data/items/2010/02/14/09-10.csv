Which means that at some point, your mail is unencrypted in <i>their</i> machines. But they would have to be outright malicious to intercept your messages at that point, so I think we can trust them on this.<p>Anyway, there is more than just your e-mail: there is your connection logs, the quantity of messages you receive (and from whom), retrieve (and when) and sent (and to whom).<p>Plus, the relevant authorities could compel <i>them</i> to surrender <i>your</i> logs. You may prefer that they (have to) ask you directly. (EDIT: Vivtek says this happens very rarely, if you care do ditch the logs, so this may be a small issue.)<p>I don't think we can get closer to <i>truly</i> anonymous web based mail.

I agree, I find it highly annoying when you click on a link to discover the part you want to read is hidden from you behind a pay wall. Search engines should show what we see the non paying public, furthermore I believe google doesnt like the addition of words to raise the rank of the page, sites which do this should be penalised for this behaviour.

1124353,comment,1124297,1124297,0,0,jrockway,,,"This showcases several major problems with our legal system.  The first is obvious; cartoons are not children, nor can they be abused.  So there is no point in going after people who possess said representations.  Not really my thing, but definitely not a federal crime.  (How long until any document the Ruling Party doesn't like becomes ""obscene""?)<p>The second problem is more subtle; and something I see as a major threat to the rights afforded to the accused -- ridiculous trumped-up charges, and minimal pleas in exchange for not going to trial.  15 years in prison for owning certain books?  Who would risk a fair trial if that's a possible outcome?  Much better than submit to the will of the system and take your six months.<p>Fifteen years should not even be an option on the state's table.  1 year max.  Fifteen years is what murderers and rapists get, if they have a really bad lawyer.  Is owning books worse than taking someone's life?<p>Not going to trial means that the legal system never has a chance to strike down these blatantly unconstitutional laws, leaving anyone who owns books open to potential criminal charges.  Are you sure the government likes every book on your shelf?  With this kind of precedent, you should probably quit reading and just watch CSPAN -- It's What's Best.<p>Edit: I just realized that many actual child rapists face fewer than fifteen years in prison.  So rather than reading a book showing someone who might be underage, it's better for you to just rape children instead.  A fine message our lawmakers are sending us.<p>A few more cases like this, and I'm quitting programming and going to law school.  This stuff needs to stop.",1266140752

If it is just some entity that create a universe (like maybe we could simulate a universe in a computer), then you have to ask where does god come from? You have not answered the question at all, you have only pushed it up one meta-level.<p>Imagine we were beings in an artifical life simulation, created by droodlewhoops. Maybe one day we would figure out that that's the case. Then we still don't know what droodlewhoops are, hence we don't know anything.<p>You are right that atheism is also a kind of belief, that is way these day it is more common for rational people to be agnostic.",1266140607

Look at your digital watch, look away for a bit, and look again.  If the digits are different between checks, you are dreaming.  I'm told that this happens with enough regularity that it's a fairly reliable universal dream-test.  (There are also others; google ""lucid dreaming"".)<p>The most effective test for me has been trying to jump out of my window.

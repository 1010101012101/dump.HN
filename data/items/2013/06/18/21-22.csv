I don&#x27;t know if you have an understanding of the process of publishing a paper? But every researcher publishes his or her paper through a journal. These journals have panels of reviewers who check them and after that the publisher publishes them in the journal (or not). Getting your paper published in respected journals reflects on your status as a researcher. Most of the journals are owned by some big companies who put them behind a paywall.<p>So you can try to create a platform for paper publishing at a low cost. But researchers don&#x27;t get the peer reviews they normally get and the publicity they get in a &quot;big&quot; journal. Uploading them to your platform as a secondary platform would not be allowed by the journals they publish to. So that&#x27;s the flaw in your plan.",1371592523

5902316,comment,5898840,5900881,1,0,davidstrauss,,,"> Citation needed.<p>First, I define containers by their capabilities, not a vendor or kernel calling them &quot;containers.&quot; The Linux kernel, internally, has no concept of containers; it merely provides the resource-sharing and security-isolation building blocks to implement containers. It&#x27;s userland utilities like LXC that assemble the necessary blocks together to provide what administrators recognize as containers.<p>So, let&#x27;s talk non-virtualization-based resource- and security-isolation.<p>Workload Manager (WLM) [1] has been a part of IBM z/OS since before it was even called z/OS. WLM implemented something like cgroups scheduling, in that existing utilization samples feed into future scheduling to ensure responsiveness and fair access to resources under contention.<p>The Resource Access Control Facility (RACF) has mapped allowed program access to resources since 1985 [2], which functions similarly to modern mandatory access control.<p>> I&#x27;d go as far as to say that there is no such thing as a mature container technology. The fundamental problem of containers is that mainstreams kernels are not designed to be multi-tenant.<p>It&#x27;s your turn to provide some citations. You could argue that the Linux kernel has failed to achieve good multi-tenancy support, but saying it hasn&#x27;t been <i>designed</i> for multi-tenancy just makes you look ignorant of the last five years of development on namespaces, cgroups, and general multiprocess resource scheduling.<p>> They support multiple users quite well but when you try to have multiple root users, badness ensues.<p>Containers aren&#x27;t about having multiple root users, even though that&#x27;s technically possible if you opt to use Linux UID namespaces, which aren&#x27;t mandatory.<p>> I&#x27;m quite sure it&#x27;s not faster than virtualization.<p>Citation needed, especially since you&#x27;re arguing that more layers of abstraction (kernel + hypervisor + kernel) is at or above the same speed of fewer (kernel + cgroups/namespaces).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workload_Manager"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workload_Manager</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/features/racf/racfhist.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/z/os/zos/features/racf/racfhis...</a>",1371592503

The license doesn&#x27;t allow you to drive a vehicle; it allows you to use public roads that have certain rules, for safety mostly, associated with them. Your license proves that you understand said rules and will obey them while on the public road. A lack of a license shows you cannot be bothered to follow the rules and are a danger to everyone else on the road. Therefore, you must be removed from the road for the safety of the others. Preventing an unlicensed driver from using a public road is more about the other people on the road than the single driver. Your freedom doesn&#x27;t allow you to be a danger to others.<p>For instance, in many US states you are not required to have a license to operate farm equipment on a public road. There&#x27;s likely many reasons for this but the rules of the road in those areas do not restrict you in those cases.<p>If I had a large enough tract of land that a shortcut going through the middle was beneficial to people around the property I can put up a sign at the entrance that states if you wish to use my road on my land then you follow my rules.

5902265,comment,5900083,5901927,1,0,mazelife,,,"I&#x27;m not sure I follow all the points you&#x27;re making.  But...<p>1.) I&#x27;ve created CSV import/export admin functions for models many times and I agree it&#x27;s a minor customization. I&#x27;m not sure why changing templates is a no-go for this or anything else.<p>2.) To me it seems self-evident that the admin was designed to facilitate model-oriented CRUD operations. The fact that it&#x27;s hard to integrate non-relational data stores like mongo have nothing to do with the admin, and everything to do with the fact that there is currently no agreed on way to plug NoSQL data stores into Django&#x27;s ORM. Although this has been is a longstanding point of contention and there was a GSOC project that I think eventually became <a href=""http://www.allbuttonspressed.com/projects/django-nonrel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.allbuttonspressed.com/projects/django-nonrel</a> , my sense is that there just wasn&#x27;t/isn&#x27;t enough interest in making this a part of Django core. In other words, this goes well beyond what I would call &quot;admin customization&quot; and get&#x27;s down to pretty basic questions about what sorts of persistent data stores should be supported by the ORM.<p>3.) Again, this seems to me to want to be able to stretch the admin beyond what it was designed for. To your point: &quot;the first page must be a list of models regrouped by apps. This is in advanced apps [nonsense], most likely when you use a lot of reusable apps, where the code doesn&#x27;t reflect the end-user experience, the admin will look ugly. But should the admin reflect or map somehow the end-user experience? It&#x27;s a &#x27;complex mapping&#x27;.&quot;<p>I agree! This is potentially a <i>very</i> complex mapping. While it would be wonderful if there was some way to handle these sorts of things while retaining the easy-to-use, declarative nature of the current ModelAdmin approach, that&#x27;s a tall order. The right answer at that point might be: build you own admin.<p>With all props to the current admin, the areas where I see it &quot;starting to show it&#x27;s age&quot; are skin, user experience, and features. I don&#x27;t present Rails&#x27; ActiveAdmin as a lightyears-ahead-alternative, just an example of an admin that is incrementally better than Django&#x27;s in those areas I mentioned.<p>When I say the admin approach to &quot;class-based views&quot; feels disconnected , I mean that while it is technically correct to say that, for example, <a href=""https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/admin/options.py#L1094"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/...</a> is a &quot;class-based&quot; view, it&#x27;s not a capital-C Class-Based View. In other words, this is an area where features that have been developed in core have not made it back into the admin, even though they could be enormously beneficial and help to make the whole thing more pluggable. That actually seems to be one of the goals of django-admin2, which is great news.<p>It may be that you and I don&#x27;t really disagree here all that much. I was responding to the statement of the parent: &quot;try to do anything custom [with the admin] and you&#x27;re screwed,&quot; which I don&#x27;t think is true. But there are definitions for &quot;custom&quot;--things that go way beyond providing a simple way to model-oriented CRUD operations--that present some real challenges. And frankly, they may go beyond what a general-purpose, easy-to-configure admin can or should do.<p>(unrelated to my point: the example app of mine I cited does not support filters and actions. It certainly could, if I or someone else had the time to and the need to add it. But it presents some thorny UX problems like &quot;what does it mean to filter out model instances from the list view when the instances are also nodes of a tree? Where do the children go?&quot;)",1371591702

In this particular scenario, I think I would rather say that the government has a legal monopoly on violence. The legitimacy argument breaks down for oppressive governments where some revolting citizens take up violence because they see it as their last and only option. Some might argue that their act is legitimate, but it is still illegal. Now, one could always say that if the violence by government is not legitimate, it is no longer a <i>government</i>. But that is largely a philosophical/literary point. Here, when people are saying that Government has a monopoly on violence, they mean that the voters have granted them a legal right to do use force (which is at least pseudo-aggressive if not violent in all cases).

There is one remaining grocery chain that is Hungarian. The malls are Austrian. The phone company is German. The gas company is French.<p>Land ownership is being concentrated in the hands of a very few, very rich individuals - partly simply because the average salary here is about $500 a month, and partly because of policy explicitly crafted to this end.

In that respect, isn&#x27;t the media coverage and outcry on the internet accomplishing the same thing?<p>> Personal example: Nearly every time I&#x27;ve seen a group of picketing workers outside an office building has been the first I&#x27;ve heard anything of their employers&#x27; practices. Even if I might care as a customer, why would I know about it?<p>I hadn&#x27;t considered this case, and you&#x27;re right that it can serve a purpose locally.<p>Instead of an example like that, when I hear protest I tend to think first of political gathering, e.g. the Occupy protests, which appeared to be more an example of special interests trying to spur legislative action than a method of communication.",1371589231

If I were establishing an outer limit, I would look at a couple of tier 2 long distance carriers (because there are very few that are nation wide), and add in a company like Backblaze or CrashPlan. It would make a fun exercise to dig in to the quarterly filings of some tier 2 LD carriers, but they buy and sell each other so often, and there are so few that operate nation wide, it ends up being a lot of work. Another possibility would be to compare to a mobile operator like Virgin or MetroPCS. Neither operate their own networks, but they do have their own backend systems.<p>That would give you an idea of the size we&#x27;re talking. It&#x27;s really not all that big. I don&#x27;t think people realize that the technology that drives telephone networks (especially once you get outside the last mile) lends itself very well to snooping.",1371589219

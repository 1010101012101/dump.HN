Do they mostly intend to raise the stakes for their lower margin competition?  Delay major Android phones at a crucial juncture in the race?

While its difficult to feel any empathy towards a manipulative, despotic, authoritarian regime, I also think that most westerners misunderstand and underestimate the people and their situation.<p>The NK brand of communism is just a thin veil for the old dynastic feudal caste society that Korea traditionally was. This is just how the country was for over 2 millennia. The north, especially due to its easily defensible mountainous terrain, has always played a pivotal role in keeping larger more powerful threats from absorbing the whole. Considering its history it sheds some light into understanding their extreme xenophobia.<p>Westerners always raise the question, why don't the people rise up against the injustice? This is a culture steeped in confucianism, the patriarch is supreme and group cohesion and harmony is of higher importance than the  needs of an individual. Even linguistically, social order is embedded into the language with many different levels of honorifics for different rank and class.<p>A little off-topic but just my 2 cents.<p>The Caste System:

I had almost the same experience in the south of France.<p>I was first on the scene of an accident where a car had taken a corner too fast and rolled. The car was upside down, the roof was partially crushed and petrol was pouring out of the car but the engine was still running. The single occupant was a young woman who appeared semi-conscious but was bleeding where shards of glass were embedded in her chest. I checked her vitals and then wanted to switch the engine off. Because of how she was positioned (half out of the window and without a seatbelt) I could not reach the ignition to turn the engine off. I was worried that the petrol pouring out of the car might ignite. I had to squeeze myself through the passenger side window but the roof had partially collapsed. After a bit of a struggle to reach I succeeded in turning the engine off.<p>By the time I had extricated myself from the car and returned to the driver a crowd had started arriving and were simply gawking (but not helping). Then someone lit a cigarette and I flipped. I'm the least aggressive person you could meet but I pretty much clouted him, gave him a mouthful of abuse and then when back to the driver.<p>It was a weird experience because ""normally"" I have a really bad phobia of blood.

If the exit event is simultaneous to the entry of the other marble, they are separated by a spacelike interval despite the causal relationship between the two events. This violates relativity.<p>On the other hand, in the original analogy the two events are separated by a lightlike interval, which while impossible in the case of marbles, at least does not violate relativity when the two events are causally linked.

The function body of a generator is generally not executed until you call .next() on it, so that's why you don't get a NameError instantly. Also the value, that you .send() into the generator is not thrown away either. In your example the generator just runs into an exception before it goes into a state in which it would accept a .send() call. Just consider this modified example:<p><pre><code>  >>> f=lambda: (yield)
  >>> gen=f()
  >>> gen.next()
  >>> gen.send('foobar')
  'foobar'</code></pre>",1324390746

Text gets blurrier quicker than when using a lighter background. I came to this conclusion after years of using dark backgrounds, and having switched to light backgrounds.<p>Personally, I think the question should not be 'white background or black background', because IMO a light gray or blue background is even better.

There are a lot of models available in NetLogo, but it doesn&#x27;t look like it would be very powerful in terms of running larger scale simulations, and the scope of the language&#x27;s usefulness is pretty limited compared to that of a general purpose language.<p>While I have been using C++/Rcpp to extend R as an occasional time saver (for analysis rather than simulations), it&#x27;s only been little snippets written badly.<p>Anyway, since its so easy to come up with a too long list of technologies to learn, then only scratch the surface, hearing that Erlang/Elixir isn&#x27;t the completely wrong tool is helpful.",1428469166

9338840,comment,9338408,9338408,0,0,mc32,,,"My take on this, from my experience, is that some managers manage by cargo cult.  They skim HN, HBR,  etc. and introduce things --whether they are appropriate or not. Many times these are new (but not always young) managers who are just learning and don&#x27;t have a lot of experience to go by beside reading some management books on the side.<p>A daily standup for a team which communicates well and has good interpersonal communication between collaborators and clients is kind of overkill.  So when this happens, you jump through these hoops because that&#x27;s what they put there.  My experience is that it&#x27;s not worth bringing up the lack of value added to the manager, as they see that as impugning their better judgement.<p>I can envision situations where a daily would be helpful, yes.  It is however, currently overused/abused as a management tool, in my opinion.",1428468827

Everyone has to be there at the same time, which means that either everyone has to arrive at the same time (annoying, inconvenient and unnecessary) or everyone has to interrupt their work at the same time. Aren&#x27;t interruptions grand?<p>I would love something less synchronous and centralized.<p>The cost goes up quadratically with the number of people you add (every single person has to spend 1 unit of time and attention for every other person) while the benefit is limited to either the people working together most directly—who should be communicating constantly anyhow—or for the manager.<p>Having everyone stand around to update the manager is not great for anyone <i>but</i> the manager, but of course they&#x27;re the ones mandating and organizing standups in the first place. I&#x27;ve seen a few cases where that&#x27;s what standup devolved into.<p>It&#x27;s easy to do standup wrong, and the benefits of doing it <i>right</i> are not immediately obvious.

It is not because I haven&#x27;t given them a shot - I have spent (wasted) ~1000 x 15 min (avg) of my life on this useless misery with nothing to show for it but an overabundance of stomach acid.<p>In my last job (best one of my career so far), I was able to convince my superb director that stand-ups suck and he allowed us to replace them with a meeting-free written-by-a-certain-time variant. What followed for our team was one of the most productive periods that I have ever witnessed. This contrast convinced me that stand-ups are one of the reasons development has started to suck for most developers; we are being gang-statused to death by cargo-culting ignoramuses. When I saw the movie Zero Theorem, I instantly sympathized with poor Qohen Leth - he just wants to work but is constantly harassed and statused by various minders, who really should not exist in an efficient workplace.<p>In my current job, this tired old stand-up specter rose its ugly head once again today, for reasons that have nothing to do with the development team&#x27;s productivity.

They run from the mild, like a slight itch some people get when they eat peaches, to deadly.<p>I have a neighbor who&#x27;s daughter is basically deadly allergic to just about everything anybody would consider normal. It&#x27;s so bad that they struggle combining foods she can eat to get her complete nutrition...it&#x27;s so bad that she&#x27;s gone to the hospital with respiratory issues from accidentally coming in contact with somebody who had come in contact with one of her allergy triggers...<p>Her mother fought (and lost) a campaign to keep eggs out of school meals because they&#x27;re one of the guaranteed-to-kill-her-daughter triggers. I had no idea how many foods have egg in them, but it appears to be just about all of them.<p>So you sit down and think about this, there is no way evolution could have possibly produced a person who&#x27;s immune response to fairly normal environmental factors would be to send her into immediate shock, stop her breathing and kill her...it&#x27;s just not possible, unless she&#x27;s a random mutation, her entire genetic line would have been killed off the first time they encountered a wild grass or tried to eat a wild egg or whatever of the other couple dozen triggers she has. (I&#x27;m not ruling out that there may be some genetic predisposition to a wildly out of control immune system). So my conclusion is that it either has to be environmental (which genetics could make her predisposed to some combination of genes and environment that&#x27;s gotten her here) or behavioral, the clean house theory (which I suppose also ends up being environmental in a way).<p>I think it&#x27;s also possible, knowing her mother, that once she found out she was allergic to one thing, helicopter parenting stepped in and her exposure to other normative immune triggers was stopped, perhaps making things worse.<p>This year her mother finally started taking her to some kind exposure therapy where she&#x27;s training her system to be able to handle eggs. Apparently so far successfully. So my guess is that she probably just needed to grow up getting dirty and eating all kinds of stuff to train her system.<p>Another story, my wife and I were out at he seashore some time ago for vacation. Of course we ate a bunch of seafood there, something my wife grew up with (growing up in South Korea) and I didn&#x27;t (growing up a normal picky American). One night, her eyes and mouth swelled up and we determined she must have an allergy to something she ate (she has no other allergies we know of). When we got back we took her to an allergy specialist and they did a whole bunch of tests and she came back with some kind of alarmingly high measure in some blood test. They told her to stop eating some class of foods and a bunch of other stuff and to start carrying around an Epinephrine injector.<p>The thing is, <i>that was it</i>. They had no information at all for why she was suddenly &quot;deathly&quot; allergic to food she&#x27;d literally been eating weekly for her entire life (whatever the measure was in her blood, it was so high they sent it off to another senior specialist for further comments since they had never seen it that high in their office...an allergy specialist clinic).<p>They also had no information later on why, when she ate the same foods they warned her against (she&#x27;s stubborn) she had absolutely zero reaction and continues to have no reaction to this day. The whole testing process looked reasonably scientific, with the grid of pin pricks and before and after blood draws and tables full of numbers from this or that blood factor. But in the end it seemed like the specialists knew no more about the subject than either of us, and we didn&#x27;t know anything at all!<p>Very little has done more to shake my belief in modern medicine than the series of interactions with her doctors.",1428467831

This leads to a lot of management-by-bestseller, cargo-cult agile, and the sort of dystopian teams that grind the minds of otherwise talented developers into useless pulp.<p>It&#x27;s not that these managers are incompetent or bad-intentioned, just that they never got any solid guidance on how to lead, manage, and grow a team.<p>What&#x27;s truly insidious is that the problems don&#x27;t really start becoming catastrophic for months or years, by which time it&#x27;s very, very difficult to turn the ship around.<p>One of the more powerful tools for fighting this sort of problem is the retrospective -- a weekly block of time where the team goes over what works and what doesn&#x27;t -- but, more often than not, the retro is the <i>first</i> thing that gets cut from the process because &quot;nobody has time.&quot;",1428467786

9338792,comment,9338408,9338408,0,0,DigitalSea,,,"I have worked in quite a few Scrum/Agile workplaces over the years. I have seen it work really well and I have seen it work horribly as well. The weakest part of Scrum is definitely the daily stand-up. I have often questioned whether or not I am wrong over the years because it seems the bulk majority of those who have worked within a Scrum ecosystem seem to like the daily stand-ups. I have voiced my concern about them over the years, but it usually riles people up and ends up being a one-sided debate with those in favour making you feel like a bad employee.<p>The biggest gripe I have with daily stand-ups and I am sure there are others (including the author) who agree with me on this: they often run over and turn into meetings/debates. While some workplaces I am sure have it down to a science, I routinely encountered stand-ups turning into group bitching sessions about a bad deploy, a changed requirement or issue someone is happening as a result of something that someone else did in a previous release or a management decision. Instead of staying on task, they would often derail. Even when someone would try to steer the stand-up back, it was too late. It would be short-lived and it would derail again. Time after time.<p>There is nothing worse than the feeling of being in a stand-up knowing that you have a few tasks with looming deadlines that you want to get done. This sinking feeling in your stomach that time is escaping you and there is nothing you can do about it. That the 15 or 20 minutes the stand-up is going for, you might have been able to knock one of the tickets off your list and reduce your stress levels a little bit. It&#x27;s a horrible feeling and one I have felt many times over the years. It&#x27;s a kind of anxiety that stand-ups seem to make even worse.<p>More often than most, the question of what did you do yesterday usually results in: I don&#x27;t remember. And you know what, if you have a lot on your plate, that is a fair statement to make. What is the point of saying what you did yesterday other than to appease to micro-managers (as the article points out)? Does Steve the system administrator truly deep down inside care about that bugfix I finished yesterday? No. The stand-up seems to operate on this purist view that people have a set plan of what they will work on for the day. As a developer what I plan on doing for the day about 90% of the time never works out how I would have imagined.<p>I come into work with the greatest intentions of finishing off an outstanding task or finishing off some low-hanging fruit tasks in Jira, but then something will break, someone will ask me to do something and say that it is urgent and BOOM! there goes my &quot;planned&quot; day of doing what I planned to do invalidating what I just said in the stand-up.<p>I feel like I am in a minority that views stand-ups as distracting, starting out as status updates that usually diverge into meetings that cut into my precious morning. Don&#x27;t get me started on what happens when someone is working from home, has to dial in and all you can hear is children screaming or dogs barking (I&#x27;ve beared witness to that a lot).<p>These days we have tools like Slack or Hipchat, we have collaboration platforms like Github, Bitbucket and peer review applications like Crucible. I feel like the stand-up is an outdated relic in todays development ecosystem. Instead of making it a single discussion everyday, how about we work on making teams talk together on a daily basis when they have a problem instead of waiting until the following day to bring it up?<p>A place I contracted at recently used Slack and they had a #standup channel in which people would post what they would be working on today, there was no requirement to dwell on yesterday only the today. And if there were any blockers or issues, you were encourage to create an issue in Jira and tag your manager instead of voicing them in the chat. In my opinion this was a good approach because it meant people could give an update without distracting others and on their own terms.<p>Stand-ups encourage anti-communication in that they seem to be used in place of actual communication, they can also feel like pitchforky at times: meaning people often get publicly implicated and blamed for issues/hold-ups which usually results in a defensive response. &quot;I can&#x27;t do anything until Michael addresses my blocker&quot; to which Michael would reply, &quot;I can&#x27;t get to Daves blocker task because I keep getting asked to do other things&quot;",1428467559

It was great because:<p>1) It let me set the tone and path for much of the interview, since so many places do unstructured interviews.
2) It was a concrete demonstration of my skills.
3) Java and mobile are both hot technologies, and the game also made effective use of other common stuff like Open GL, multithreading, network, database storage (via sqlite), etc.
4) Spending a few minutes playing a game sets a relaxed tone for the entire interview, which makes things easier for everyone involved.<p>Structured interviews really are a brilliant strategy. Whenever I interview, I do my best to subtly direct the interview in a way that exposes my strengths and leads the conversation into areas that I am most comfortable with (and trust me, whipping out a concrete example full of technologies that you&#x27;re absolutely comfortable with helps). A structured interview, to an extent, would allow the employer to retain better control of the interview (whether or not the realize it), which is probably to their benefit. For instance, I teach Java, C#/VB, and some other modern languages at a local college after work, do tons of C / embedded / network / etc. stuff at work, and do digital electronics for hobby ... so if you let me push the interview in those technical directions, I&#x27;m at an advantage.",1428466962

I came to this conclusion in various ways.<p>First, her work was abysmal when I looked at it, and demonstrated complete ignorance of the technical field she was supposed to work in - she had an MBA and her attitude was &quot;I don&#x27;t need to learn anything technical because it&#x27;s my underlings&#x27; job&quot;, but her underlings had about the same technical skills. Her lack of output adversely impacted fundraising for the C round, which strained the company finances and caused management to hire me in desperation.<p>Second, every single stakeholder I talked to in the company - from heads of departments to junior staff - thought she was abysmally incompetent and her work was severely lacking. In some cases, the frustration was so strong as to border on the personal. I talked to over 40 people and could not find a single champion of her work. It was clear that the company expected me not just to fix her problems but to make a good case to get rid of her as well.<p>A month into the project, I realized management was very evasive whenever I tried to bring evidence to the case to be made to replace her. I learnt through the grapevine that she had gotten the management team into a room and announced her pregnancy (&quot;hey guys, I have some really good personal news to share with you!&quot; - yes, she was that transparent). The news spread gradually throughout the company, and as it did, an eerie silence replaced the comments as stakeholders resigned themselves to their fate.<p>I left the project unable to effect the change I had been hired to do (she refused to use any of my work and blocked anybody else from using it), and she was still employed there two years later.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;ve seen plenty more evidence of bias in the other direction, including an employee I had personally hired for her exceptional skill who was later fired - I am about 80% certain - because my replacement as team lead didn&#x27;t like working with women (he argued budget cuts but she was the only one fired in a team of 30).

We&#x27;ve found them more necessary in projects with larger groups and shorter timeframe.<p>One counter-intuitive thing about them.  &quot;Oh great another meeting&quot;..  You may get back some time spent on email correspondence or impromptu meetings when every issue has to be emails back and forth.  Just hold it until the next standup.<p>The author said you don&#x27;t want to wait 8 hrs until the next mtg to alert the PM of a blocker, but often you can make progress on other tasks - save the emails - or even worse - the impromptu meeting.  Often, it can wait until tomorrow.<p>Most important, don&#x27;t let the standups get off track.  Either a PM who tries to turn it into a regular meeting. It&#x27;s not a 30 or 60 min. status update they may be used to. Or - who lets people run wild.  It&#x27;s 15 minutes and that&#x27;s it - and take things offline.",1428466421

Another on 5pm. Some people see this 15 minute stand-up serves as a major interruption. I see it as a way to consolidate some of the tiny interruptions throughout the day into one.<p>Also teams have individuals of varying experience so we consider the stories to be a team goal. This makes the more experienced individual more willing to help those still learning since they are no longer making a trade-off for their own stories vs somebody else.<p>Lastly, I&#x27;ve worked on projects from 1-20 people and beyond a certain size, daily meetings are just mandatory or things fall apart. In a previous project, I ran these big daily status meetings and they tended to run long. Everyone hated it so I dropped it for a few days but then the code started breaking due to lack of communications. We decided to split the meeting into smaller groups and they ran quicker and there were less complaints. However we were still able to keep the code quality.<p>But I think the most important things is &quot;one size doesn&#x27;t fit all.&quot; If something is not working, have an open discussion within the team and suggest some alternatives. If there is no avenue to give feedback, that is the fundamental problem.",1428465722

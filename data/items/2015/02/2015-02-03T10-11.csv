8989668,comment,8987602,8988316,0,0,dmichulke,,,"The problem with this type of planning is that it is not nearly powerful enough to address real problems in Starcraft (except for the given examples) because:<p>-discreteness: Well, I think it&#x27;s safe to assume that every starcraft state is discrete (for sure it&#x27;s binary representation is) but in general you cannot assume it.<p>- imperfect information: For planning, it&#x27;s necessary to know or meaningfully guess the state of the enemy and that is not possible due to fog of war. Therefore, everything involving enemy interaction cannot be planned.<p>- dimensionality: There are so many actions available at each state that you shouldn&#x27;t even be able to reach a depth of 3 of the planning tree in a reasonable amount of time. For instance, if you have 50 units, you can send each subset of them to attack or move to say 128x128 points on the map, you end up having 2^50 x 16k x 2 possible moves.
And that doesn&#x27;t include build units, build buildings + some more exotic stuff like patrol, set rally points, ...<p>You can prune some stuff (e.g., never attack with peons after minute 10, never move to or attack your own buildings) but the order of magnitude should stay the same.<p>So planning is nice but not for continuous problem spaces (real world), problems with imperfect information (every good card game) or problems with a high number of actions (something as &quot;easy and simple&quot; as Go), rendering it IMO not so useful after all.",1422960328

For example, when self-driving cars become pervasive, they&#x27;ll remove a source of livelihood for a large section of human population. Driving has a low barrier to entry and can be done by most able-bodied humans irrespective of their level of acquired intelligence. This description works for most jobs that are going to be automated away.<p>Typically any automation problem we solve rolls out globally at a staggering rate. It puts people out of jobs faster than they can skill up. Also, social and economic mobility is externally constrained (and changes can only happens over 2 or 3 generations), and not everyone can move up even if they try. Which means automation will give rise to an increasing number of people who cannot undertake non-automatable knowledge-work, and thus become doomed to be unemployed, and leads to a self-reinforcing cycle out of which they cannot escape. This is a problem that the civilization has to confront, and our current way of thinking about economics will not work there.<p>The so-called &#x27;fruit of others labour&#x27; notion is something that made most sense in the pre-industrialized era. Applying it today in its entirety without considering how much of an inter-dependent society we have become is simplistic. This is as true in technology (open-source software that powers commercial entities) as in other fields (research that builds on top of pre-existing knowledge, industrialized economies impacting global ecosystem, ..).<p>If we consider that each of us is beholden to the collective past of entire humanity, the idea of ownership and &#x27;fruits of labour&#x27; becomes just a social construct. This construct nevertheless is required today and for the foreseeable future as the only practical way to divide resources.

I&#x27;ve heard Woz say something similar, and if you look at it a certain way then it&#x27;s easy to agree with him. What he means by that is that the Apple ][ was the first computer that came with everything so you could plug it in and start work. The Altair and other&#x27;s that people may consider as contenders for the first personal computer required more technical skills, like not coming with a keyboard, or requiring you to do a certain amount of assembly. So by one definition the Apple ][ was the first computer that you could buy, plug together and boot up Basic or VisiCalc and start doing some work.<p>At least with the first Apple ][, Woz designed the whole of the hardware, the ROM, and the first Basic. Later on that Basic was replaced with Microsoft Basic, which caused problems for Apple later on with the Macintosh when it came time to renew the MS Basic license. Steve Jobs did have some influence on the Apple ][, but far less than Woz, he worked on the PCB layout (as far as making it nice and everything line up, not the actual routing), and the case design (designed by Jerry Manock), which was revolutionary at the time. The switch-mode power supply was also unique in a computer at that time, and was not designed by Woz, but by Rod Holt. Woz&#x27;s disk controller is probably the most impressive piece of design from that period though.<p>It was a very close thing though as the Commodore PET was actually released only a few months later, and was even more easy to set up as it came with a built in cassette drive and display. It&#x27;s interesting that in most of this history Chuck Peddle, the designer of the PET, gets very little recognition, much less than he should. As well as designing the PET (which led on the the Commodore 64 and others), he was the main designer of the 6502, the processor used in the Apple ][. There&#x27;s also a story that he met Woz and helped him debug one of his 6502 designs.",1422957993

I dare to say that your historical account is inaccurate. We stuck to our traditional layout for a while. 
What does it matter if the keyboard wasn&#x27;t customized in physical sense anyway? You should be looking at the screen, not at the keys. If I recall well, Polish typewriter layout (PN-87) was still available on Windows 95/98. The now prevalent >Alt + something< one was called &quot;programmer&#x27;s layout&quot;, and the name itself indicates that it wasn&#x27;t originally thought of as everyman&#x27;s layout.<p>Domestic software certainly used the typewriter layout - for instance <a href=""http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAG_%28edytor_tekstu%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAG_%28edytor_tekstu%29</a>, once a very popular word processor for PC, last version released in 1996.<p>The typewriter layout finally got extinct, but what spelled its ultimate demise was the internet, I believe.<p>Early netiquette actually forbid using Polish diacritics, because of encoding issues - in that era you could never be sure whether the other person would read &quot;gwóźdź&quot; or &quot;gw░¶d¶&quot;, so it was considered good practice to stick to Latin characters only.<p>Meaning that users didn&#x27;t get to feel the pain of having to press Alt + whatever all the time, and so they got hooked on default QWERTY.<p>As the last of Mohicans, I use the typewriter layout to this very day (for typing in Polish; I alternate), only I had to recreate it myself (using Microsoft Keyboard Layout Editor)*<p>It allows for much faster typing in compare to these inconvenient right-Alt shortcuts. Swapping Y with Z by itself is a win for a Polish speaker (writer), given that Z is much more common in Polish. While its frequency is at mere 0.07% in English, it reaches 4.9% in Polish, placing it in the top 10. Thus putting it under the weakest finger of all - your left pinky - isn&#x27;t very considerate.<p>-------<p>* Funnily enough - I&#x27;m not flame baiting - when I decided to try Linux, hailed for its customizability, I found out that recreating my favorite layout wasn&#x27;t as easy.

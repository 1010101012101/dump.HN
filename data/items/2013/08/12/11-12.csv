6198714,comment,6198430,6198430,6,0,smackay,,,"Perhaps Professor Cocking should have read James Lovelock&#x27;s &quot;Gaia: A new look at life on earth&quot; first.<p>&quot;The day came for the tropical trial at the field station in Northern Queensland. A culture of P. eegarii was without ceremony sprayed in diluted form upon a small patch of experimental rice paddy. But here the bacterium forsook its contrived marriage with the cereal plants  {40}  and formed a more exciting but adulterous union with a tough and self-sufficient blue-green alga growing on the water surface of the paddy field. They grew happily together, doubling in numbers every twenty minutes in the warm tropical environment, the air and soil providing all they needed. Small predatory organisms would normally have ensured a check on such a development, but this combination was not to be stopped. Its capacity to gather phosphorus rendered the environment barren for everything else.<p>Within hours, the rice paddy and those around it took on the appearance of a ripe duck pond covered with lurid iridescent green scum. It was realized that something had gone badly wrong and the scientists soon uncovered the association of P. eegarii and the alga. Foreseeing the dangers with rare promptness, they arranged that the entire paddy area and the water channels leading from it be treated with a biocide and the growth destroyed.<p>That night, Dr Eeger and his Australian colleagues went late to bed, tired and worried. The dawn fulfilled their worst fears. The new bloom, like some living verdigris, covered the surface of a small stream a mile away from the paddies and only a few miles from the sea. Again, every agent of destruction was applied wherever the new organism might have travelled. The director of the Queensland station tried desperately but in vain to persuade the government to evacuate the area at once and use a hydrogen bomb to sterilize it before the spread was beyond all possibility of control.<p>In two days the algal bloom had started to spread into the coastal waters, and by then it was too late. Within a week the green stain was clearly visible to airline passengers flying six miles above the Gulf of Carpentaria. Within six months more than half of the ocean and most of the land surfaces were covered with a thick green slime which fed voraciously on the dead trees and animal life decaying beneath it.&quot;<p>EDIT: Added full title of the book.",1376308759

AOL made that free in 2006, but didn&#x27;t switch you automatically: you had to call up and ask to switch to the free plan, which had become identical to the pay plan except for the $10/mo fee.

6198698,comment,6197546,6197924,2,0,flumbaps,,,"Free markets don&#x27;t solve every problem. There is such a thing as the price of anarchy. I agree that Crony capitalism is bad too, but free markets aren&#x27;t the only way to introduce accountability into a system. The problem with healthcare is the large number of inherent perverse incentives.<p>For example, if you don&#x27;t regulate the quality of healthcare, then it is quite easy to make money selling bad quality services. Many people are gullible and some die needlessly from being sold &quot;cures&quot; that do nothing. People with cancer are a great target, because the real treatments are so unpleasant.<p>Medical research requires a lot of expensive equipment. You could have a lot of government funding research - but academia has its problems. Academic research isn&#x27;t always very focused and efficient, it doesn&#x27;t always bridge the gap between theoretical and practical. Otherwise you have to provide incentives, which usually means patents. However, if you have patents on new drugs, then that grants a de facto monopoly on that treatment. The drug company that is the sole supplier of the medication that can save your life has an unsettling amount of market power. How do you solve this problem? Do you think in a truly free market, groups of people who were sick would band together and fund research into their cure? That would be a very slow process. The capital to find a cure should raised as quickly as possible to save as many lives as possible. To do that, you have to have expected future returns from people who aren&#x27;t sick yet.<p>Regarding the question of who gets to open hospitals and operating rooms - I can easily believe there is crony capitalism going on. However, this is something that should be regulated and controlled. Having hospitals open and close like regular businesses is not a good thing. If a restaurant is poorly managed, customers realise it from the quality of the food and the business fails because they lose customers. If a hospital is poorly managed, people can die. The negative market pressures in healthcare involve actual human suffering and death. It&#x27;s not going to be much comfort if your dying act is posting a poor review of a hospital that lost your paperwork, misdiagnosed you or did the wrong surgery.",1376308414

Note 2: it appears that in fact other people developed electromagnetic telegraphs before Morse -- e.g., a chap called Schilling in Russia in 1832 -- but Morse is the one commonly thought of as inventing it, and is surely the answer the examiners were looking for.)",1376308035

6198646,comment,6195595,6197344,1,0,argonaut,,,"An element of your argument relies on defining a liberal arts education in a specific way that is by no means the accurate or sole definition. American schools are quite unique in that, as opposed to universities in the UK, there is something called a &quot;liberal arts education,&quot; which in that context is taken to mean the concept of a core curriculum / general education requirements. There is no reason that a liberal arts education as you define it is inherently interdisciplinary, there is no reason that whatever advantages you claim stem from interdisciplinary studied is not covered under a core curriculum definition of liberal arts.<p><i>Nelson seems to think they don&#x27;t.</i><p>You&#x27;re seriously misinterpreting what he says about how modern degrees don&#x27;t impart critical thinking skills. His criticism is directed at Ivy League educations in general - not only pre-professional degrees but also liberal arts degrees:  &quot;I didn&#x27;t have habits of mind that a liberal arts education was supposed to have given me. And not only did I not have it, none of my other colleagues had itpeople who had graduated from Princeton and Harvard and Yale.&quot; It bears noting that Harvard has no pre-professional degrees except engineering (no business degree); it&#x27;s clear his criticism is drawn out of his disappointment that a liberal arts education was supposed to give him and his colleagues critical thinking skills, but failed to do so.<p>Furthermore, the instant I looked at the link you posted, I could already tell that that wasn&#x27;t actually the degree requirements for Wharton (I could tell that those were the requirements for a major but not for graduation). So that&#x27;s a really poor example.

What is the total traveling population per year that would get from point A to point B that would ride planes if not for hyperloop (assuming it becomes reality).  That gives you the number of planes that would be used per year.  Need to consider per year, because a lot of traveling is seasonal.  Then what is the cost to maintain those planes, operating costs like fuel and pilots, insurance costs for damages and risks, etc, etc.<p>I have no idea how the total cost of ownership would compare.  But I wouldn&#x27;t write off hyperloop just because it would be expensive.  It may be possible to make it work.  Given how much plane tickets cost, I can easily imagine people paying more money for something that&#x27;s seemingly more convenient and safe than planes.<p>edit:  The man figured out how to turn launching rockets into a profitable business.  The man thinks it&#x27;s possible to build a nation-wide charging station network that can charge all the cars his company builds for free.

In that way the NHS is as much a tyranny as any of the other things we pay taxes for, like roads, schools and emergency services. People here in the UK like having the NHS. The US system, where unlucky people get a choice between bankruptcy or death, sounds pretty horrible to us. When I see people get upset because their taxes are going to subsidise the healthcare of others, I don&#x27;t understand it at all. It seems short sighted and selfish to me. Personally, I gladly pay to keep my country healthy. This is Britain, not some backwater third world country where poor people are left to fester and rot on the streets.<p>We do have private health insurance here in the UK, but I&#x27;m sure there are restrictions on who can do business and where and when. I think that is unavoidable. There are obvious difficult trade-offs when legislating this kind of thing. Not everyone can be made happy. However, the freedom to operate a medical business without government interference is not as important as ensuring that everyone has access to adequate healthcare. If your rights as a business owner get trampled on at the cost of saving human lives, well, frankly that&#x27;s just too bad.

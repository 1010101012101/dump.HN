Honor and morality is highly subjective.<p>Even within the most honest folks I have met, very few reward the people they stood on the backs of to make it to the top.

Makes it extremely hard to get a good deal on housing. Affects quality of life.<p>4. Places with very low costs of living and relatively high quality of life tend to attract lots of annoying foreigners. Locals then tend to dislike foreigners.<p>5. Moving can have big overhead.

129317,comment,129121,129201,0,0,simonw,,,"""Didn't seem very modular, you can only use the Django ORM and templating engine.""<p>Very common misunderstanding. You can use Django with SQLAlchemy (I have done in the past). You can use Django with Genshi, or Cheetah, or whatever template engine you like (I would strongly recommend using something like Genshi for outputting XML). It's usually better to stick with the Django ORM though as it will let you use many of the excellent extension applications for Django (such as django-mptt, django-tagging or the Django admin package). The same is not true for the Django template system - replacing it with something else has no disadvantages at all that I can think of.",1204676111

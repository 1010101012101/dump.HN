I use a myth server with three tuner cards (QAM and regular analog) as my PVR solution.<p>If TW required me to get a converter box, I'd likely drop them immediately.  They recently (in this last bill) showed that the cost to rent a converter box (dual tuner HD DVR) is now $14 a month.  Considering I'd need one for every TV in my house, that would effectively quadruple my cable bill! (I've got TVs that aren't hooked to the myth server, they simply plug into the wall and get TV).<p>ETA: I don't use TW for my internet anyway.  I used to, but it was constantly down.  Now I use AT&T DSL (dry loop) and it's a little slower on the top end, but it's not failed yet, AND it's $20 a month cheaper.<p>ETA2: I used to try and get the TV over firewire to my mythbox, but TW has blocked firewire output for <i>everything</i> but the locals, so firewire is not an option.",1207929374

There are some products that can benefit from sales effort on day 1.  Most (especially consumer plays) really can't.  For the first 3-4 months, what is a biz guy gonna do, other than sell?<p>I should also add that I truly GET the value of a biz guy.  Every company I have build has required that evolve (or devolve, if you want to be a hater!) from builder to biz guy.  I've played the biz role for more of my adult life than I've played a development role.",1207929071

What's happened in the last of month is that the VC's have put one of their own guys in as president (not someone that they chose - one of the actual VC's: formerly a stock-broker with no previous experience running a company), who is now starting to dictate schedules and parts of the technical direction.<p>My question is: this is unusual, right?  I understand that it's common to put in a CEO at a later round, but having the fund-raisers in the presidential role while we are still in heavy development seems very out of the ordinary...<p>Has anyone else experienced this?

Admittedly he won't be building the product with you but the contacts he makes, the meetings he manages to arrange and the time spent getting other people excited about the product make it a lot more enjoyable to work on since you know there are others out there just as excited as you.<p>The real ""business guys"" are the ones who shield you from the outside world so you can focus on the technology and can find and make the connections with others that you're too busy hacking to do.  Unfortunately these people are often grouped in with the ""idea guys"" you all to often see online saying ""I have a great idea, build it for me and we'll split the profits 50/50"" but then don't actually contribute anything to the process besides the original idea.<p>Business guys good, Idea guys pointless.",1207927481

Because it unchains the hacker with a little people skills from his terminal.<p>With modern languages, frameworks, automated testing, debugging, and IDE's, some hackers can produce much more per unit time.  Or produce the same amount in less time.  And then go out and talk about it with the time saved.<p>Sure, business guys often bring something to the table, but so can unchained hackers.  Just like women threw away their aprons to join the workforce, hackers can now set aside their keyboards to sell.<p>Don't forget, a lot of hackers are ""business guys"", too.

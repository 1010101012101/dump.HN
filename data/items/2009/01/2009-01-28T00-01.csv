The reality is that culture is almost always coercive & has many irrational elements. Dress codes particularly so. The fact that <i>they</i> base it on supposed hard facts is irrelevant. People always think they have hard facts backing up their irrational convictions. Covering women is a fact of virtually all societies. Including the US or wherever you're from.<p>As I said in the original. I do not agree with the conventions of Saudi. I don't like them. There are many cases of women being disadvantaged to the point where they have no hope of a satisfying life. That needs to be opposed.

Working in an established corporation can be a startling experience though.  Sometimes people seem to do absolutely nothing and collect a nice bonus or raise at the end of the year, etc.  On the other hand, when I started grad school, it was very clear that some students were in over their heads and they were mostly gone by the first semester.

This article goes much further than that.<p>As high-level as Lisp is, it's still a general-purpose, turing-complete language and as such there's always going to be a DSL that's better suited than it to solve a particular domain-specific problem.<p>While it's true that you can embed DSL's in Lisp easily with macros, that doesn't address the editing issue at all. Current IDE's are not so easily extensible to support the high-level semantics of new DSL's, so even if your DSL is 20x more expressive than vanilla Lisp in your domain, you lose a lot of that productivity to the lack of tool support for it which we've grown accustomed to having with general-purpose languages (syntax highlighting, dependencies, reverse-dependencies, parameter hinting, refactoring, etc).",1233102702

Proponents of status quo always invoke tradition and use some attractively pastoral but highly marginal examples to paint a white-washed picture that's quite far from reality.<p>In reality, it's not about the clothes. Muslim men base forcing women to cover up on ""hard"" facts of <i>exactly</i> the ""sun orbits the earth"" variety. If you did not think western, you would know that these men think of women as being both naturally disabled (mentally <i>and</i> physically) and inferior in the eyes of Allah (intellectually <i>and</i> morally). This goes far beyond mere decorum and is not at all comparable to office wear vs. bikinis.<p>Case in point, a few years back I spent a month at an all-women resort in one of the more liberal muslim countries. Once, I happened to swim in front of a local man. To say that he was stunned would be an understatement. His eyes bugged out, he lost his breath, and when he finally managed to speak, he was stuttering. Turns out he quite literally thought that women are physically unable to swim. It was as though he witnessed pigs fly.<p>What I am saying is, it's easy to take the cultural relativism position until you consider where it leads. As just one example, this is what happens in Saudi Arabia today during rape hearings. A man's testimony is considered fact unless proven otherwise, similar to Western law. A woman's testimony however is considered a presumption, based on these ""facts"" as loosely quoted from actual Saudi law: women are emotional and as such incapable of sound judgement, women do not participate in public life and as such incapable of understanding what they merely observe, women are forgetful and as such their words are unreliable, and finally, men are by God's will superior and therefore dominate women by default.<p>So what do you think happens to rape victims when you frame it in those ""cultural"" terms? By the way, if you think you know where I am going with this, you are wrong - rape victims get sent to jail for the crime of being in the company of a male non-relative in the first place. When you get down to actual lives of actual people, it's not quite as conveniently multi-culti anymore, is it?<p>So let's <i>not</i> be careful of what we are criticizing. When a tradition is practiced by a whole people, it's cultural norm. When it's forced on a minority that's unable to defend itself - even if said minority has been slowly beaten or acculturated into docile agreement - it's perfectly ok to say it's asinine and just plain wrong.",1233102581

The first group uses the * View controls, uses the designer, does everything (or most things) declaratively and generally conforms to the Microsoft way. Then there's another group of developers that care about design patterns, maintainability, testability, and everything else that goes along with being a good programmer, not just a good employee. I started out in the first group and now I'm in the second. It's a totally different world.<p>Microsoft has made a lot of effort lately to improve their appeal to hackers. They have free (Express) editions of their tools. IIS is still free. If you want the full-blown tools, they're available for <i>very</i> cheap (BizSpark) for startups. They're releasing more and more source code everyday (you can step through the .NET Framework core while debugging in VS2008) and CodePlex is helping bulk up the available OSS libraries for .NET. It's very rare when I need a library and there isn't an open source one or its included in the framework.<p>ASP.NET MVC is an excellent framework and eliminates most of the problems Webforms has. Webforms has its place in corps for the first type of developer I listed above, but MVC is made for the second. I wouldn't spend anytime with Webforms if I were just starting out.

Lisp is essentially the parse tree, which all languages have, so it provides the syntax agnostic representation.  Macros allow you to easily specify DSLs, plus the macros themselves are lists and thus manipulable by macros.  The lisp machine is essentially emacs that really is an OS, so the entire programming environment is programmable.  But, emacs on top of some shell isn't so bad either.<p>The only thing missing is the syntax layer.  Maybe regexps could suffice?  Also something like LaTeX can provide a rich variety of symbols and symbolic structures for syntax.",1233101530

453023,comment,452746,452986,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"First: I don't believe this. I went to grad school (in physics) with a couple of students who had spent one to five years in industry first. They weren't exactly <i>indistinguishable</i> from the other students: my impression is that they had a better idea of why they were there and what they wanted to do once they left, a more finely calibrated sense of what to study and who to work for to advance their chosen careers, and perhaps a slightly shorter time to graduation. They certainly didn't seem to find it much harder than anybody else.<p>(Anecdotal evidence, obviously, and a small data set. You're welcome to bring your own anecdotes if you like, or even data.)<p>Second: I'm not advising that someone work in industry or on a startup for <i>fifteen years</i> and then go back to school. You can sample careers pretty quickly unless that career is ""professor"". I believe most startups do you the favor of giving you a quick but intense taste of the startup life and then promptly failing, saving you the embarrassment of having to quit. There's also no rule that says you need to sit at your desk at Microsoft until they kick you out: You can work there for a year or three and then go back to school, and the choice is yours. By contrast, it is <i>really</i> hard to leave grad school and then return, so once you're two years in to your Ph.D. program there will be strong incentives to stick around until you're done, even if it takes eight years. The only way out is through, unless you want to become what Matt Groening once called ""The Bitterest Person in the World: The Grad-School Dropout"".<p>Now, it is true that getting a professorship could take you a very long time, and that you therefore want to start as young as possible so that you still have some youthful vigor left to find a new career after you can't secure a tenured position. But you can spare a handful of years.",1233101234

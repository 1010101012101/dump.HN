8733532,comment,8732859,8732859,0,0,kh_hk,,,"&quot;the worse the better&quot;, I am happy about this.<p>Articles about this have been going around Spanish news aggregators for a while. Now that there&#x27;s an official statement from Google, message will finally go around the world showing what kind of stupid laws the Spanish government is passing around with the influence of the powerful copyright lobbies.<p>Now, about the recent Spanish Intellectual Property reform. The particular reform affecting Google is actually called the AEDE tax. This reform will affect <i>any</i> news aggregator operating in Spain.<p>AEDE stands for Asociación de Editores de Diarios Españoles, as in Spanish Association of Newspaper Editors. This private association, together with another one called CEDRO, will take care of collecting this tax. Even if your publication is not associated with AEDE and because this reform is law, they will have the obligation to collect it.<p>This reform smells exactly the same as an old anti-piracy law. Just change AEDE for SGAE (another association, related to authors and editors). For a while, any kind of media support was subject to this tax. Any media support, including hard drives and even cameras, on the pretense that these <i>might</i> be used to store content subject to IP. This law was derogated on 2011, but not completely. Now it&#x27;s the state the one who pays this tax to SGAE. I can see this AEDE tax having poor results, and either the public or the state ending up having to pay for it.<p>Funnily enough, this just shows how weird and different some people think. This tax is proposing that news aggregators cause loss damage to news producers just as torrent aggregators cause damages to Warner. Note that this IP reform also includes fines of around 150k to 600k euros for running a site that links to copyrighted material. Before, it was only an infraction if a site was causing &quot;significant damages&quot;. This has been eliminated, as in, any damage is a significant damage.<p>Just as a remark, let&#x27;s not confuse this with the so-called &quot;Google Tax&quot;, which is related to stopping Google and other big co&#x27;s from evading taxes in Europe and has nothing to do with intellectual property. To be fair, I do not even know by now, as they call &quot;Google tax&quot; anything that is going to affect Google, nevermind.",1418280093

How long can such stagnation continue before there are severe consequences.<p>Doesn&#x27;t sound so dire... The main reason that inflation-adjusted income has increased in the average US family unit since the 1970s is that it went from one bread earner to two. (See e.g. Elizabeth Warren&#x27;s research on debt or her books, for instance The Two Income Trap, for the gory details.) I&#x27;m not seeing pitchforks.<p>In more seriousness, this is not meant to be a contest. The point is that things aren&#x27;t as bad on the continent as you might read in Anglo-Saxon news outlets.<p>There&#x27;s some uneasiness and some distress, sure. Here, like on the other side of the pond, the main cause of it at the end of the day is economic woes, most of which stem from bailing out the well connected instead of having let the financial system collapse -- for better or worse.<p>The most important take away, imho, is that we&#x27;re at peace. Consider... Since the fall of Rome, we had been almost constantly at war with each other. Whereas besides the Balkans in the 1990s, and the ongoing skirmishes in Crimea, there has been no war here since WW2. That&#x27;s the longest period of peace between Europe&#x27;s major powers in history. And thankfully, no ending of this streak is on anyone&#x27;s radar.",1418279060

I can cross-compile it for another OS and architecture, then deploy a single binary file without worrying about dependencies, dynamic linking, or segfaults.<p>Try doing that in C/C++.<p>Maybe a better comparison is to more systems-level applications like you might code up in C. The same benefits carry over to those, without a significant performance hit (usually).<p>(And to be fair, sometimes C/C++ is the better tool for the job. But give it a shot; Go is pretty handy when you don&#x27;t need to drop down to lots of unsafe memory and CPU operations.)<p>By the way, your existing C skills will be very useful in Go. For example, struct fields will still be padded unless you pack them carefully. Your experience with buffers, streams, memory allocation, and data structures will definitely not be wasted in Go.",1418277667

Mozilla&#x27;s been using search ad revenue from Google and now Yahoo for revenue. If Mozilla gets into the search engine game they&#x27;ll be getting in to the advertising game. And the advertising game is about serving up your users and what you know about them to the highest bidder.<p>That doesn&#x27;t sound like a good fit with Mozilla.",1418277621

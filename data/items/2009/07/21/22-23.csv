I'm using Rails for the site, which of course assumes certain conventions, but I've actually found it easy to loosely couple the site to the old system (by using views to extract the relevant data plus a little extra Ruby code). Most people in my dept haven't even heard of RoR but I've already had a positive reaction to the proof of concept which blows the old site out of the water and was built in less than a week.<p>The UI advice in the article hits the nail on the head.

For example, Marginal Revolution at <a href=""http://www.marginal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marginal</a> revolution.com is nominally an economics blog, but it also discusses foreign travel, ethnic cuisine, books, and more. The blogs I contribute to try to follow the same general principle: The Story's Story at <a href=""http://jseliger.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jseliger.com</a> focuses on books (except for the present top post, which is about keyboards—sometimes exceptions are interesting) and Grant Writing Confidential at <a href=""http://blog.seliger.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.seliger.com</a> .

Any suggestions?""<p>As others have said, don't write a blog if you don't have a purpose. Your purpose should come from something you care about deeply enough to know something about that you'd like to transmit to others: in my case, that means books, chiefly, but also grant writing. For many HN readers, it probably means programming. Remember too that the deep knowledge/writing/transmission process isn't linear, but recursive: I've probably learned more about books by trying to sort my ideas about them out in a logical, rational way than I would if I just read a lot (this, incidentally, is why good schools require you to write a lot: writing forces you to embellish the ideas you do have and often to come up with ideas you didn't have previously).",1248215557

716942,comment,716791,716791,0,0,lhorie,,,"Having used Prototype + Scriptaculous, jQuery and Ext, I'd say jQuery is a good generic library choice. Libraries these days are fairly interchangeable in terms of core features, but I find idiomatic jQuery tends to be shorter, more intuitive, and overall more popular (which is good if you plan on leveraging existing plugins for those sorts of things that browsers really should do but don't).<p>My experience with Ext hasn't been so great because I feel the learning curve is a bit steep, there are a lot of leaky abstractions and whenever I had bugs, they were both difficult to trace and to fix. Also, I feel deviating from the defaults tends to be cumbersome (or impossible)<p>Prototype has improved immensely over the years, but imho, the improvements are also its downfall: historically, the Prototype API has been pretty unstable, with methods moving from one class to another and some APIs being completely overhauled.<p>One other library that I should mention (that I haven't used much myself) is Dojo as it is the ""Java of Javascript"" in terms of domain specific libraries. There's stuff ranging from crypto to comet there.<p>Pick your poison, I guess.",1248213995

This both because it gives the writer the opportunity to explore themes at lengths, and it gives the reader a certain amount of predictability in what they are going to find.<p>Narrow-focus blogging also has the advantages of allowing you to build a more diverse audience. This may sound counter-intuitive at first, but the more subjects you touch the more you end up narrowing your audience to people who think like you.<p>I think your instincts are correct.

Constellation program, (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Constellation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Constellation</a>)<p>Ares and Constellation are dead, except in name. The NASA budget has been reduced to a level that is incompatible with completion of the program. I've read NASA insiders acknowledging this on semi-public message boards.<p>See this, for example: <a href=""http://www.spacepolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/griffin-goddard-speech.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spacepolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/grif...</a><p>> But work at the staff level continues out of view of the nation’s elected\nleadership, and in the recent passback to NASA from the Office of\nManagement and Budget, the news is not so good. After a small increase this year, Exploration Systems at NASA goes down by $3.5 billion over the next four years. When combined with earlier reductions of almost $12 billion during the Bush Administration, well over $15 billion has been extracted from the Exploration Systems budget in the five short years since the new space policy was announced. Funding for lunar return in the Constellation program was\nalready less than $4 billion in the years prior to 2015. This was to be allocated to early work on the Ares 5 heavy‐lifter, and the Altair lunar lander. With only a half‐billion dollars now available, this work cannot be done.",1248213642

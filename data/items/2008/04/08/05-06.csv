But there's also long-term time savings to consider as well...<p>I haven't really done much in Python yet unfortunately, but I've worked quite a bit in Perl, PHP and Ruby, and personally I don't find any of them mind-blowingly different from one another, syntax aside.  Some have more succinct syntax for looping and other things, but no major paradigm-shift IMO (like the one from imperative to functional).<p>Most of the complaints against PHP (just like MySQL) are about things that were solved years ago, but continue to linger on anyway.  I like to think of PHP not so much as a language though, but more as a wrapper around C with memory management and a more flexible type system.  Looking at PHP that way shows why many of its inconsistencies exist (e.g., in function names).  It's also of the ""structure is optional"" philosophy, which requires more discipline to code well in.<p>Anyway, I think it comes down to figuring out whether it would save time now and later to use PHP or Python.",1207633906

In the situation of\n  the latter, it is a case of the child having not had something given\n  to them that you judge to be fundamental.\n</code></pre>\nLet me see if I have your logic correct here by extending it a bit into hypothetical-land. Suppose you have blue eyes, and suppose further that the culture of the world is such that those with blue eyes are never chosen for white-collar jobs: only for lower paying blue-collar ones. There is nothing intrinsic about blue-eyed people that makes them poorer workers -- with the proper training and experience they would do equally as well as their hazel-eyed brothers and sisters; that they are never trained and chosen for the good jobs is just how the world happens to be.<p>This situation is morally acceptable because nothing has been forcibly taken away from them. If we were running around stealing food from the mouths of those with blue eyes, then it would be wrong because it would be violating their property. However, as they never had a good job in the first place, there is nothing wrong with a world that denies them the opportunity to aspire to one.<p>Do I have that right? (I'm pretty sure I do, as you can substitute ""poor parents"" for ""blue eyes"" above, and my second paragraph is a very close paraphrase of your counterargument.) If so it's an odd place for a line in the sand: Taking what you have now is morally wrong, yet arbitrarily* removing opportunities for what you may have in the future is perfectly acceptable. (* Arbitrarily as in: without regard to your capabilities or to your past choices.)<p>You have a very long and loud argument against government, largely on moral grounds... But I'm not talking about government, I'm talking about the morality of poverty itself, specifically in children who have no responsibility for their situation.<p>It is perfectly possible talk about whether their situation is just or not without invoking government: Suppose you had access to a magic button, and pressing it will -- at no cost to anyone -- give every child a fair start, where their life's success will solely be the product of the wisdom of their choices. Is there a moral imperative to press that button? Would it be wrong, in the way that theft is wrong, to turn your back on it?<p>If yes, then what we end up with is a debate along utilitarian lines: At what cost must we address the wrongs done to those born into poverty?<p>If no, well, that is where I throw the 'nasty names' around.<p>p.s. : A total side issue, but I don't see that taking stuff off a dead person is ""stealing"" from anyone. ;)",1207632341

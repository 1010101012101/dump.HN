However, the difficult thing about teaching just from research and theory is that it is extremely difficult to gain a concrete understanding without a concrete presentation.<p>When I was going through the teacher education program in college, we read a lot of (what I thought were very compelling) scholarly articles explaining how current practices (regarding instruction, assessment, and so on) were flawed and then proposing better practices.<p>The discussions we had were often of the ""Okay, I see what the author is saying"" variety, but ended up with very little actionable follow-through. I remember getting in trouble for trying to heed the advice of the research (""I don't care what the research says, we're doing it this way and that's final."")<p>What I am trying to say is that research and statistics are all fine and dandy, but the students at Harvard are mostly white and mostly from reasonably affluent families who live near other reasonably affluent families. Ideally, we could study those realities directly via fieldwork, but that's simply not a possibility for most. So, in lieu of giving these students a completely abstract understanding without any lived experience (even if it is vicarious and fictional), ""The Wire"" comes in.",1284497711

Not a single founder/c-level leader has remained from the bought company over five years. Often, significant turmoil was present prior to that final departure.<p>This has been such an observation to me that I would strongly suggest that if you were to be on the buyer's side you should terminate all staff from the acquired company as soon as feasible, thereby making either a customer or ""idea"" purchase. This is exactly what DHH is saying.<p>On the other hand, acquiring a company and letting it live ""as-is"" I suppose is a viable alternative; better accomplished by just investing in the company itself though.<p>The benefit of acquisition is control, and it is a waste if you aren't going to exercise that control.

Why is baseball so popular in Japan?<p>Double eyelid surgery isn't exactly about making the eye bigger. It's to emphasize a small fold between the eyelid and the Epicanthic fold. It's considered beautiful to see just a small sliver of the eyelid from underneath the fold, and in many East Asians, the fold tends to grow too low. Additionally, as people age, the skin of the fold tends to sag and people may want some of it removed in order to open their eyes up.<p>From wikipedia ""The procedure of reducing or removing epicanthic folds is epicanthoplasty. It is now an extremely rare procedure. Blepharoplasty, however, is not an uncommon form of cosmetic surgery in East Asia. The use of ""eyelid glue"" or ""eyelid tape"" (sometimes referred to as ""eye glue"" or ""eye tape"") is used to create the appearance of the ""double eyelid"" by finding a ""natural fold"" in the eyelid and tucking it in and holding it with an adhesive.""<p><a href=""http://waynesword.palomar.edu/images/epican1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://waynesword.palomar.edu/images/epican1.jpg</a>",1284497400

As the web ages, it seems the proportion of old and potentially outdated information in Google's index to new information is increasing.<p>While Google Instant is technically impressive, the feeling of speed is undone whenever I have to next manually restrict the results to the past year or 6 months or whatever (and sometimes experiment with multiple durations) in order to filter out discussions from 2008 and earlier.  Same with using regular search as well.<p>Hence, might I suggest you guys consider something like inverting the default search, to only include pages created or modified within the past year (or whatever duration you calculate most optimal for returning relevant results)?  Or perhaps changing the PageRank weighting of recency, at least for domains that change rapidly.  I know this could cause some problems, and I'm not sure the web is quite at the age where this is necessary yet, but I think there's an inflection point coming soon where more searchers will expect recent results in their top 10 rather than years-old pages.<p>It might also be worth moving the duration filter up one tier of UI so it is both clearly visible on the search results page, only takes one instead of two clicks to activate.  The OP isn't the only one who's recently needed searches restricted by age and didn't realize just from the UI that this could be done.  A few months ago I made a similar complaint on another forum and was informed of the same thing - use Search Tools -> Past X.  But it's not obvious to do that on the current UI.",1284497303

So you need to model that into your P/L model.<p>Things get even messier with a derivative, because let's say you are trying to sell an option position. Whoever your counterparty you sold your option contracts too, probably has some counter-strategy in which they might hedge their option transaction with an underlying equity or with another option spread at a different price whose counterparty might choose to hedge with an underlying equity position.

I have almost no problems with people who smoke weed every once in a while, just as I don't have problems with people who go to the pub sometimes or with people who drink the odd coffee. I do sincerely have problems with people who smoke pot every other night, or every time they hang out with people, or every time they get even a little stressed. (Medical marijuana doesn't count, though, provided naturally that it's actually necessary. I'm not going to judge people when they're in huge amounts of pain.)<p>The thing is, though, that past this little speech, I can barely defend my arguments.

You might want to talk to a mental health professional about these things. Your childhood environment could have made a negative impact you're not yet aware of.<p>Other than that, try focusing more on doing things you believe is useful to the next generation. Feeling valuable to the next generation is hard wired into humans but often times ignored causing the well known mid-life crisis.

A business is based on how many people actually USE what it makes, and are ready to pay for it.<p>Exactly. Perhaps a good way to view this would be to resrict the definition of supply to be only something that has a demand. So a fisherman that ""supplies"" rotten fish that nobody wants is not providing a supply, he is just wasting resources.<p>The hard part of economics is always the supply part: how can you increase supply? (Supply defined as what people want.) When productivity is below the subsistence level, increasing supply consists in just producing more food. But as productivity grows beyond the subsistence level, the challenge becomes an informational one: out of all the things you could do, what should you do to increase the total supply the most? A man who is hungry just wants more food, any food. But a man who is sated will only want certain particular kinds of food or maybe something else entirely.<p>This is what prices in a free market are for: they provide information about what the economy needs the most. In an economy of hungry people, any kind of food will sell. But as the population gets sated, prices will tell producers that common-place food is not needed anymore and that they should produce something else.",1318649512

There's not really a rat race option for what I do, but if there was, maybe I'd take it.<p>Incidentally, I don't really have a problem with people using the freedom they've gained from stepping off the treadmill to do nothing. If someone wants to use their freedom to become a ""beach bum"" I have no problem with that.",1318647788

Television networks aren't respected because they produce... an awful lot of garbage. If google starts being directly responsible for the Jersey Shores of the world then surely their brand image takes a hit.<p><i>Producing a ""show"" or a ""movie"" requires a teeny, tiny amount of effort and resources these days, and can be done without spending more than 4 figures on equipment and whatnot.</i><p>Though it must be said that the only way you can produce a movie <i>really</i> cheaply is if you can persuade folks to work for peanuts in the hope of breaking into the industry.<p>But if low-budget stuff <i>becomes</i> the industry, then the supply of folks willing to work for nothing in the hopes of being the next George Clooney will die up when George Clooney starts taking home five hundred bucks a film.",1318647751

Simple, straightforward and funny. Awesome execution. (Killed a good 5 minutes with the app...) Might just be worth the dollar and change. :)",1318647730

I actually got hit by the Gmail spam filter with my Hacker Newsletter (<a href=""http://www.hackernewsletter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hackernewsletter.com</a>) project last week. Checking that specific email in the tool however shows it scored a -0.1. :) So, as with anything... use this resource with care and make sure you do a lot of other testing as well.",1318647695

For a long, you could of course use ~0ul, and so on for other types, but then you'd have to find and update every such assignment if the variable were ever changed to a wider type.",1318647672

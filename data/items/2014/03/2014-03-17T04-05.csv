7413154,comment,7412536,7412536,5,0,NamTaf,,,"Text of any form is not good for support because it amplifies the back-and-forth duration required to actually determine the issue and walk them through the resolution. The key here is bi-directional conversation - that is, you can talk to them and they can talk to you at the same time.<p>Think of someone helping Grandpa with using his email. On the phone, most of the time is spent in back-and-forth, explaining a concept multiple ways until he understands the request. The information he gives back may be vague and incomplete, so you can discuss it with him to get instant further clarification and context. You can then walk him through the solution in a bi-directional conversation, whereby you say a step and then he asks for clarification about certain aspects, before you proceed to the next step.<p>Now consider email/text/etc. Focus even on the solution stage. You send 5 steps to perform to complete the task. He gets stuck on step 2, and so responds. He doesn&#x27;t know if he&#x27;ll get stuck on steps 3, 4 and 5 either because he can&#x27;t get past step 2. That&#x27;s potentially 8 emails back and forth to get the problem resolved.<p>By not having instantaneous bi-directional communication, it is a hell of a lot harder to debug and walk someone through the solution particularly if they&#x27;re not technically adept. For us on HN it may be fine - we can stumble our way through blanks relatively easily - but for Grandpa, he has no hope of doing that and so phone support is by far the most time-efficient method.",1395032096

They don&#x27;t sue. They don&#x27;t get fanfare for it. They quietly resign and move to other pastures. And nothing changes for their coworkers (and other women and men in the industry) who are also harassed.<p>Resigning and talking about it is actually pretty courageous. She doesn&#x27;t win, she gets a stigma. Her company doesn&#x27;t win, it gets a stigma. But the spectators with their mouths agog realize that this kind of mismanagement/harassment is not only happening under noses, but also being noticed externally (it&#x27;s endemic; while women and minorities likely deal with it a lot more, it&#x27;s not just gender-based, it often happens to the lawful-good no matter what gender or race in small tech companies) and, for a brief time, these companies pull themselves together and become better places to work, if only because it&#x27;s expensive and time-consuming and morale-killing to fuck this stuff up.",1395031968

I was wearing a dress and I didn&#x27;t realize what I was engendering in the audience. It was a huge audience and they were kind of going ape-shit. So I just dove off the stage, and suddenly, it was like my dress was being torn off of me, my underwear was being torn off of me, people were putting their fingers inside of me and grabbing my breasts really hard, screaming things in my ears like &quot;pussy-whore-cunt&quot;. When I got back onstage I was naked. I felt like Karen Finley. But the worst thing of all was that I saw a photograph of it later. Someone took a picture of me right when this was happening, and I had this big smile on my face like I was pretending it wasn&#x27;t happening. So later I wrote a song called &quot;Asking For It&quot; based on the whole experience. I can&#x27;t compare it to rape because it&#x27;s not the same. But in a way it was.

7413116,comment,7412612,7412612,21,0,curiousgeorgio,,,"Of course we may never know for sure exactly what was said (unless everything was secretly recorded somehow... NSA - data, please), but my initial reaction is that this story sounds a bit... exaggerated. Were things said that shouldn&#x27;t have been said? Probably so. But here&#x27;s the way I read it from TC:<p>Let&#x27;s look at what Horvath claims:<p>> character started being discussed in inappropriate places like on pull requests and issues<p>It&#x27;s unclear what exactly this means, and in most cases, bringing up someone&#x27;s character in PRs is certainly inappropriate. Does it happen? Yes, it happens all the time, regardless of gender. A PR comment like &quot;it&#x27;s a bit naive to assume these conditions will be met in this instruction - please fix&quot; is technically bringing up someone&#x27;s character inappropriately. She never claimed (at least as quoted by TC) that sexist or intimidating things were brought up in PRs/issues - just that &quot;character started being discussed&quot;.<p>> She calls her colleagues’ response to her own work and the work of other female GitHub employees a “serious problem.”<p>Again, pretty unclear. The response to her work MAY have had nothing to do with her gender or any kind of personal/social conflict, but rather based solely on performance. If such was the case, then I&#x27;d say colleagues tend to &quot;respond&quot; to other people&#x27;s work all day long. I honestly can&#x27;t say the &quot;response&quot; in this case was completely benign, but again, the article and direct quotes certainly don&#x27;t seem to point at anything specific.<p>> she struggled to feel welcome.<p>This is a common feeling in pretty much any workplace or environment, regardless of who you are.<p>> she did her best to distance herself from the founder’s wife, as well as the founder, for fear of being caught up in an unhealthy situation.<p>This is mentioned before anything else regarding the founder or the founder&#x27;s wife. It sounds like (at least the way it&#x27;s presented in the article) some kind of animosity was felt even before any real interaction between the parties. That could be based on anything (including possibly Horvath&#x27;s own prejudgement). The truth is we don&#x27;t know because we aren&#x27;t given any more details.<p>> almost immediately the conversation that I thought was supposed to be causal turned into something very inappropriate. She began telling me about how she informs her husband’s decision-making at GitHub, how I better not leave GitHub and write something bad about them, and how she had been told by her husband that she should intervene with my relationship to be sure I was ‘made very happy’ so that I wouldn’t quit and say something nasty about her husband’s company because ‘he had worked so hard.’... the wife went on to claim that she was responsible for hires at GitHub, and asked Horvath to explain to her what she was working on.<p>Just for sake of argument, here&#x27;s a possible conversation that could be twisted into fitting the above description:<p>&quot;Glad you could join us for drinks! My husband works hard to create an amazing workplace at GitHub, and even though I&#x27;m not a part of the company myself, I enjoy meeting the employees and want to help people feel welcome the best way I can. My husband told me you&#x27;re fairly new... what is it you do? That&#x27;s great. I just want to make sure you&#x27;re very happy at GitHub. In some way, I feel responsible for helping make sure the company treats everyone well. If there&#x27;s anything that could be better, I might be able to put in a word with him. The last thing they&#x27;d want is for you to have a bad experience and leave the company.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s just an example of something I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to hear from a founder&#x27;s spouse in a startup environment.<p>>  The wife also claimed to employ “spies” inside of GitHub, and claimed to be able to, again according to Horvath, read GitHub employees’ private chat-room logs, which only employees are supposed to have access to<p>I agree this is definitely crossing a line, but of course the wife only &quot;claimed&quot; to have this access. That doesn&#x27;t mean she does, and I could easily see it being said in a low voice (trying to win over someone&#x27;s &quot;exclusive&quot; or &quot;secret&quot; friendly confidence) along the lines of:<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not officially with GitHub, but I have ears. I try to keep close tabs on what employees are saying about the company in the chat rooms and company chit-chat.&quot;<p>The next few events are pretty vague. It includes rumors, a random profession of love (and rejection) outside the workplace (if she had a problem with trespassing, she should have called the cops; the male engineer&#x27;s reaction at work - if true - should have been corrected by HR, but it sounds like it was never brought up to HR by Horvath as it should have been), Horvath &quot;feeling threatened&quot;, and &quot;the founder accus[ing] her of threatening his wife&quot;, followed by the wife &quot;sitting close to Horvath&quot;. Lots of generalities.<p>Finally it bubbles to the point of Horvath claiming &quot;The next thing I knew the wife was in my face at my work station verbally attacking me&quot;<p>From my own experience, perfectly civil conversations can often be turned into &quot;verbal attacks&quot; later if it helps a person&#x27;s case. I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s what happened here, but the details are <i>just so vague</i>. What was the conversation about?<p>As for the hula hooping... you&#x27;re telling me that two women hula hooping to music in the workplace is perfectly appropriate, but when the other people nearby (who are going to be mostly males if the majority of employees are male - go figure) suddenly notice, <i>that&#x27;s</i> the inappropriate part? Really?<p>I certainly won&#x27;t say that Horvath is making this stuff up, and it does sound like some inappropriate actions <i>did</i> occur and she should be upset. But I <i>will</i> say that based on the &quot;evidence&quot; presented in the TC article, GitHub is not guilty of all the claims &quot;beyond a shadow of a doubt.&quot;",1395031474

Absolutely no panels. Only solo or dual sessions.<p>2.  No marketing sessions (nor sessions by marketing folks)<p>3.  No keynotes (except for Snowden and Assange)<p>4.  Go beyond the headline, and analyze the speaker. At minimum the person must have an interesting personal or professional story, regardless the talk.<p>5.  The more technical or obscure the session, the better.<p>In the end this strategy paid off nicely. This was one of the best years, and the first to make me want to come back next year. I watched some gems like Philip Rosedale (Second Life, now High Fidelity), Pinterest engineers talking about their dev stack in a candid and informal conversation, Carl Bass from Autodesk, Print the Legend (the movie, and then the discussion with the film directors, plus Max from FormLabs and an ex-MakerBot), NASA, DARPA, nice demos at Startup Accelerator, and a lot more.<p>I certainly missed a few nice keynotes (like Neil deGrasse Tyson), but hopefully some of the sessions will be posted later.",1395030811

My initial take?<p>It&#x27;s not uncommon for business owners to rely heavily on non-employees for advice, even in the day-to-day operations. Spouses are especially common. What confuses me is that the wife, as portrayed, seems a bit irrational--if not delusional. There&#x27;s a big difference between even vocal trusted advisors, and the sort of power the wife described herself as having.<p>So much so that I think there&#x27;s a third possible interpretation: the quotes are accurate, given by a wife that genuinely believes her statements even though they have no basis in reality. This sort of delusion, in varying degrees, is quite common across the population. We convince ourselves of something--in this case, the wife that she has power in the Github organization--and then attempt to reduce the cognitive dissonance that arrises from the belief and the evidence to the contrary. As time goes on, we try harder and harder to justify those irrational beliefs.<p>It&#x27;s entirely possible that there&#x27;s no truth whatsoever to the wife&#x27;s words, but that the wife genuinely believed them in spite of it. And that Julie Horvath is entirely accurate in detailing the conversation and the implied hostility she felt from the founder and his wife. So now, not only do you have to determine whether the conversation took place, but also whether the power the wife alleged existed in the first place. Unfortunately for Github, even if the wife never had that power, the wife was still able to contribute to a hostile work environment and that can have significant legal ramifications even though she wasn&#x27;t an employee.<p>Friends you go out for drinks with to talk about life and work slowly transform into &quot;spies&quot; who keep you informed of what&#x27;s happening in the office under the guise of gossip. Curiously taking a peek at an open chat tab on the husband&#x27;s laptop becomes &quot;access.&quot; Commenting on whether you liked a potential hire you met earlier becomes &quot;responsibility over hires.&quot; Love for your husband and concern for his work becomes an overprotective desire to shield him from harm.<p>Given how rapidly Github has grown, the idea that any trusted non-employee, wife or not, would have that sort of power and influence described seems absurd. Hell, for a while it seemed as though they announced a new hire daily. Far too many for one non-employee, no matter how often she went into the office, to have that sort of power. Especially when most were technical positions.<p>Time will tell, but for now, more information is needed. Anyhow, I suppose I took issue with the phrase &quot;undocumented employee&quot; and ran off on a tangent :). The wife needn&#x27;t have been an employee at all to have helped cause a shitstorm.",1395030784

Why does it need to be mutually beneficial?  The peers should &quot;pay it forward&quot; by uploading to younger peers, even if the ones they downloaded from are not benefitting.<p>> On a small swarm this behavior can lead to pieces drop to the 0 availability because some peers concentrate on the first few files while the last peer/seed that has the rare piece in one of the later file quits after doing his fair share, but he only uploaded data for the first few files because the prioritizing peers were interested in those only.<p>This could be mitigated by using excess bandwidth beyond that needed for streaming to download rare chunks, and ensuring that the streaming application keeps seeding for a while after the video has been watched.",1395030762

7413046,comment,7411806,7411806,8,0,616c,,,"I checked out this guy&#x27;s site.  I understand he is reinventing the wheel.  I respect that and do not mean anything negative about that.  A lot of us are here to understand the wheel and build for ourselves.  There is good value for that.<p>What I do not understand, with all due respect, is the value of Github, and to a lesser extent Bitbucket, is in the features outside of the VCS core and how most people realize there is nothing Git-like to replace the actual project management tools where people find Github value. That is, bug tracking/issue tracking is the killer feature.<p>To self-host this is problematic.  This is not to say there are not good solutions.  Traditionally that is Bugzilla, Trac, Redmine, and more recently a la ArchLinux and Music Player Daemon (MPD) I have seen Mantis BT.  It looks interesting.  The problem is, as others point out, maintenance, and adding the centralized to the decentralized, thus the point of Git, Mercurial, and others.  I noticed this guy hosts his own repos (I tried links to bugsplat.rb) and it did not load, but I assume there is not bug tracking, despite the name.<p>Even this year, I decided to look into the state of DVCS integrated bug tracking.  Very few tools exist, or many have problems.  BE, bugseverywhere, kind of exists and has seen contributions as of last year.  Ticgit was forked to ticgit-ng, but ironically that is a Github project and its bugs are in the Github issue tracker.  There was a very cool Perl project, which seems abandoned, called SimpleDefects (SD), which also wanted to do distributed bug tracking.  It was going to sync with Github and other issue tracker systems with decentralizaton, so you could git pull for bugs as well.  This one has not seen updates for years, as I can tell, but might be the coolest of them.<p>Unfortunately, keeping you whole project decentralized is difficult.  I have begun to look into fossil again, despite what people here say, because it might be ugly, but no VCS has its own bug tracker or wiki integration, all written in C.  It is the SCM and bug tracker for Sqlite, Tcl, and even for all of NetBSD packages.  The last really surprised me.  I think for the little guy, that is ideal.  Monotone might be worth revisiting (I had multiple problems 3 or 4 months ago because it was embedding Lua and they had not come up to the 5.1-5.2 API changes and builds failed; everyone is hard to find), even with the only data about it is there page and links to snarky Linus Torvalds jokes about the horror of OO data structures and modern C++ programming for a SCM.<p>In short, you should know to host your own Git repos (they are designed, with the native package tools in Git or others) to host simply on a website.  It is best for even the lowest footprint web servers, shared hosting or not.<p>What git does not have, is the beautiful features that keep people on Github all day.  I really wish distributed bug tracking advanced, but no one is interested.  This topic only comes up when Github is down (or maybe in this case but Github is having publicity problems today).  If people made a good tool like SD, that has its own bug tracking that syncs well with Github or (insert hosted SCM here), that would be fantastic.  I could be more relaxed, principally, by relying on such tools.<p>Back to read the Fossil manual.",1395030311

For example you both may code but one of you can take on the Role of Execution, meaning you will be in charge of executing any ideas the two of you come up with. And your other Co-Founder can take on the role of Strategy or Technical, meaning although he might not be the best at executing the idea or sales he can definitely understand how to get there. It really depends on your relationship and both of ya&#x27;ll strengths and weakness. Anyhow I would suggest taking on these specific roles for now until you can validate the solution you are creating and gain some traction.",1395029262

9084958,comment,9083207,9083207,0,0,lekanwang,,,"Cute idea. But as a beekeeper in the Bay Area, I have to agree with @tehchromic--there&#x27;s some tricky stuff to consider to make this work:<p>- How will they prevent the bees from covering the internal mechanism with wax? Bees often cover plastic foundations with layer of wax as they build up the cells.<p>- More troubling, why won&#x27;t the bees cover the mechanism with propolis (bee glue)? Bees tend to want to cover any crack with the stuff, which is really, really sticky stuff. Any time we&#x27;ve accidentally left an opening (that&#x27;s not the entrance) somewhere in our hives, the bees have completely sealed it up with propolis, which is then extremely difficult to clean off.<p>- How will the honey flow freely? At bay area temperatures during Spring/early summer harvests, the temperature isn&#x27;t high enough that the honey will flow freely when uncapped--it&#x27;d take on the order of at least 15 minutes, and more likely an hour or more if you want to do it cleanly, but leaving a jar of honey out for that long is going to attract all kinds of pests, and also bees, which kind of defeats the purpose of this.<p>- How do you clean this? As tehchromic mentions, this is going to have serious crystallization issues. During normal centrifuge or wax-scraping harvests, you end up having to wash all your equipment pretty thoroughly afterwards, or else the honey crystallizes and makes everything gunk up.<p>- Why would the bees uncap the harvested cells? I agree long-term that this would happen if you harvested a lot of honey, but I&#x27;ve rarely seen bees uncap the central stores of honey you&#x27;re harvesting from, especially if you&#x27;re careful about what you harvest to leave the bees enough for the winter.<p>- How will you deal with the additional pests and diseases? More nooks and crannies will encourage more pests to enter and roost. Having a spigot also encourages bad beekeeping, especially harvesting before the cells are capped. Honey is supersaturated sugars, which is why it doesn&#x27;t go bad. But if you end up harvesting before it&#x27;s capped, you&#x27;re going to get nectar or sugar water that will actually go bad and additionally play host to a ton of pests and diseases.<p>Overall, I love that this is going viral--I honestly hope it attracts a bunch of new people to beekeeping, and I&#x27;m curious enough to support the Kickstarter and try one out, but I&#x27;m guessing those who stick with it will switch to normal Langstroth hives after a season or two.",1424501975

Encryption is mandated for HTTP/2 so something like Privoxy (or even just a caching proxy) has to use a Superfish-like method to bypass the encryption.  The only alternative is to modify the browser, which they are also locking down with unchangeable ChromeOS and limiting plugins to only officially sanctioned ones.<p>...and you won&#x27;t really even be able to just not use HTTP/2 because the web will be much slower as pipelining is not even implemented in Chrome, and Firefox will no doubt drop it soon.  Websites optimized for HTTP/2 could take minutes to load without pipelining.<p>The real irony is that neither Google nor Mozilla determined what software caused pipelining problems, so guess what, it was Superfish and its like.

There are also tweets like this one: <a href=""https://twitter.com/RescueForensics/status/256765838462443521"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/RescueForensics/status/25676583846244352...</a>
&quot;We are building forensics to fight human trafficking online - abolitionists must bring the fight to the internet!&quot;<p>It looks like Rescue Forensics has aligned itself with sex work abolitionist groups that pose as anti-trafficking groups. And who have huge incentives to inflate the problem by many orders of maginitude, to create government funding for their groups and for this kind of work.<p>An aisde: as of today, @RescueForensics has 6,231 followers but only 74 tweets. The first 6,000 or so of these followers look like they were bought. Some might say that gives some indication of the ethics of this company.<p>There are two other projects that are doing similar work in scraping sex work ads in the US. The first is MEMEX - a DARPA project. <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/sleuthing-search-engine-even-better-than-google-1423703464"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wsj.com/articles/sleuthing-search-engine-even-bet...</a><p>The second is ASPASIA project, an academic project out of University of Washington. ASPASIA is very sex worker friendly, and understands the difference between human trafficking and consensual adult sex for money.

<a href=""https://twitter.com/aspasia_project"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/aspasia_project</a><p>If you look at most human trafficking law enforcement efforts, the vast majority is arrests of adult men and women who are consensually buying and selling sex. This is incorrectly labeled &quot;sex trafficking&quot; by law enforcement and the media. But the federal definition of sex trafficking is coercion, or of someone under 18.<p>It is unconscionable for law enforcement and abolitionists to use stings to go after the large, easy targets of consenting adults to pump up the numbers and money, while the horror of real human trafficking takes real investigative effort, time, and money, but doesn&#x27;t have large numbers to as easily justify this effort.<p>The real solution is to decriminalize consensual adult sex work (like in New Zealand and parts of Australia), allowing everyone to focus on the true horrors of human trafficking. But that goes against the goals of the religious-based abolitionist groups, which have hijacked the human trafficking discussion and funding to push their anti-sex agenda.<p>For more information, see my blog <a href=""https://www.escortingadvice.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.escortingadvice.org</a>, or follow me on twitter at <a href=""https://twitter.com/EscortingAdvice"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/EscortingAdvice</a>.",1424500221

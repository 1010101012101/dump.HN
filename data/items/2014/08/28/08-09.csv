8236454,comment,8235539,8236276,4,0,jarek,,,"> Would you mind elaborating more on this? More specifically about the cost the North American suburbs are starting to experience.<p>Infrastructure to serve the new developments is paid for by the developer, more or less directly (&quot;development charges&quot;, etc). That keeps local taxes nice and low for existing residents, until 50 years down the road the watermain needs replacing, there&#x27;s lots of it because of low density sprawl, it&#x27;s more complex now that construction will disturb existing traffic and business, and no one wants to pay more.<p>As an example, here&#x27;s a story about Mississauga, a green-field suburb that proudly ran a balanced budget for decades... until they ran out of empty land to build on recently. Now they&#x27;re joining denser cities in asking for more money from senior governments: <a href=""http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/the-maturation-of-mississauga/article1774204/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/the-maturation-o...</a>",1409216329

I mean public transportation couldn&#x27;t cover every section of a region, but it could serve major hubs well enough to reduce automotive use and reduce its downsides.<p>For almost 40 years Portland Oregon has been developing light rail all over the metro region.  Rail has been extended to the major districts within a 10 to 15 mile radius of downtown.  (Which is a good share of the &quot;spread&quot; that the regional urban growth boundary allows.)<p>MAX and street-car lines are heavily used but there are still many cars and traffic can be terrible.  So I guess light rail/public transit are never the whole solution by themselves.  Then again, what single modality is ever the &quot;magic bullet&quot; answer to enormously complex problems?",1409216253
8236449,comment,8235539,8236276,11,0,martythemaniak,,,"I am talking primarily about property tax rates, though as siblings have said, there are other effects, like worse health and lifestyle outcomes which are a bit harder to quantify.<p>As the article mentions, suburban municipalities made money primarily by selling land, however the price almost never accounted for the true, high cost of servicing low-density communities. This is usually made much worse by developer lobbying. Eventually the land runs out and the municipality has to either stop growing and start raising property taxes to make up for lost sales, or start densifying to keep growth going, neither of which are popular with people who though were getting a certain deal. For a lot of suburbs densifying is not even an option (no one wants to go there), so sometimes they spiral downwards.<p>Calgary makes a good example. Prior to 2010 it had the image of &quot;redneck sprawlville&quot;, but it elected an urbane, muslim, gay-welcoming mayor. One of his major issues was tax savings via ending public subsidies for suburbs. Turns out when you did the math, each mcmansion received a hefty public subsidy because the cost of servicing that house exceeded what developers paid the city. Similar patters can be seen throughout North America.",1409216242

China is known for direct state control as well. In either country you can expect to be told what you can build, how big it can be, setbacks, parking, street access, and lot sizes. USA cities are laid out with some of the worst urban planning practices in the world and markets have nothing to do with the rules and regulations imposed.<p>So recent bad Chinese practice and the USA are two examples of the same model. Neither is liberalized.<p><i>Does the liberalization of housing law lead to sprawl?</i><p>Actually, market oriented building doesn&#x27;t lead to much sprawl anywhere. Sprawl must be imposed by law or central direction of development or it isn&#x27;t economically viable.<p><i>Nobody has figured out modern living in an efficient way, I think.</i><p>Of the world&#x27;s eight big (10MM+) first world cities, half of them are famous for housing and transportation that is affordable to the middle class. And each of them has found its own way to achieve that happy situation, so there are a lot of models for efficient modern living, even under the stress of a large population. All of them have medium density (150/hectare or 40k/mi^2), more than SF but less than Brooklyn, big subway systems, high rates of home ownership and low rates of personal car driving, but the differences are substantial.<p>Seoul has lots of apartments and high rises mixed into its tightly packed single family homes with a variety of street widths. Tokyo has very narrow streets and small blocks with mostly new single family homes on small lots. Mexico City is more European with low rise flats and apartments and mews townhouses mixed with small lot single family tiny homes in the suburbs that are expanded with new floors and extensions on the lot as the family grows. Osaka has a mix of those.<p>Each of those cities is nice and and reasonably low stress place to buy a home and get around the city.<p>The other four large first world cities are driving out their middle class. London and New York are famously unaffordable, possibly with prices driven by sprawl and water or a greenbelt. Los Angeles is choked with sprawl and traffic. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on in Paris but I hear it&#x27;s expensive.<p>So some places have figured it out. And some haven&#x27;t.",1409216188

8236436,comment,8231718,8232977,1,0,blueskin_,,,"It&#x27;s true that the average random person doesn&#x27;t need a lock by Abloy/EVVA/etc. just because it&#x27;s (as close as possible to)unpickable, but I would always avoid bumpable locks as well as ones that are (more)vulnerable to destructive attacks, two categories which include quite a lot of &#x27;high security&#x27; locks including UL 437 rated ones. Bumping is still rarer than breaking a window, crowbarring a weak door frame, or kicking at the spot of a weak lock, but is definitely increasing in popularity as it&#x27;s significantly less obtrusive and doesn&#x27;t leave visible damage that may alert passers by while the crime is still in progress.<p>Myself, when I am able to own my own house, I am definitely fitting upgraded (unbumpable) locks as part of basic diligence with regards to security, along with fixing any easily breakable windows.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that windows can always be reinforced/refitted with laminated glass or even protective films that provide enough protection that the random opportunistic crackhead will probably give up when it doesn&#x27;t break straight away so as not to get caught. Burglaries that take longer than 30 seconds or so to get in will often be aborted because of the risk of getting caught, especially when there are so many houses with no or insufficient alarms, windows that can server as an easy entry point without a motion sensor behind them, and weak locks that can easily be bumped/pulled[1].<p>If you have big breakable windows, always invest in a good alarm with motion and/or glass-break sensors though.<p>[1]Pulling/snapping is gradually becoming the new bumping - some lock designs are physically weak enough that they can be either broken inside the door or physically pulled out with hand tools.

My iPhone and iPad have the Facebook app on them, I am browsing through Facebook when I get a message on my iPhone through the new Messenger app of a message just sent to me, so I get on my iPhone and access the Messenger app to read the message and it states from a friend, &quot;I see your up.&quot; So of course I respond by asking &quot;and how did you know that?&quot; he replies &quot;because I see all.&quot; I reply, &quot;Damn, I was hiding. Guess it wasn&#x27;t a very good spot.&quot; He says, I have a very special iPad that lets me see everything.&quot; because of a bet, he leaves me with that and I am just hanging here. But I am dying for the answer......I have heard stories about the new facebook messenger app and find it interesting to say the least.\nQuestion: How in the hell could he &quot;see&quot; me? I didn&#x27;t think I left any traces and thought my &quot;hiding spot&quot; was covered well enough. Please tell me.....",1409214802

All Chinese characters are three bytes in UTF-8, and there&#x27;s no reason to use it over GB, where they&#x27;re two bytes. UTF-8 would only make sense if you wanted to have a document with stretches of, say, English, Cyrillic, Greek, and Japanese text all together.<p>I can&#x27;t provide much in the way of authentic information as to your last question, but anecdotally I find it easier to finger-type Chinese into my phone than English. A couple factors are at work:<p>- I don&#x27;t adjust my style for the phone, and it&#x27;s next to worthless at predicting what I want to say (in English). This leads to a lot of thumb-tiring selection of single letters.<p>- I don&#x27;t speak fluent Chinese, so most of what I say is pretty basic stuff, which the predictive input has an easy time with. This leads into the third point,<p>- Using a pinyin input method, you can call up entire phrases by just putting in the first letter of each syllable, e.g. xx for 谢谢 or bhys for 不好意思 or ng for 那个. This is basically the equivalent of your computer automatically expanding IANAL into &quot;I&#x27;m not a lawyer&quot; whenever you type it in, except, for everything.

So if you try to filter them, you won&#x27;t have enough to get a job.<p>Instead, you can try approaching things differently. People want to judge your abilities when they feel that it&#x27;s critical to get the best employee. So you basically need to eliminate their fears. Networking and making friends works pretty good. If you are recommended by an existing employee, the interviewer will take it easy on you. Internships also work pretty good. There is less pressure. And when you prove yourself after a couple of weeks you can demand a salary or walk.<p>Homework is never a good idea. Searching for a job usually takes you through many companies. If at least half of them give you homework, you will waste days or even weeks just solving imaginary problems that nobody cares about. Solving tasks at home sounds like a good idea at first. But after you do it and the company chooses someone else, all you get is a bitter aftertaste.<p>As a personal note, it really helps if you treat the interviewers like stupid children. Some readers may be offended by this, but it really works. When you finally accept that he has no idea what he&#x27;s doing, it will be much easier to control the interview.<p>Interviewers are rarely good programmers. If they start with something like FizzBuzz, you can easily tell that they don&#x27;t have the ability to understand things. They just take ideas from somewhere and run with them. No originality, no abstract thought and no critical thinking.

They were intended to make it easier to write (by hand!) -- the idea was to reduce the number of strokes used to write common characters, and the accompanying propaganda was to the effect that using simplified characters would cut a piece of typical text from so many strokes to so many (less) strokes. Characters were targeted for simplification not based on how ungainly they were but based on a combination of how many strokes they required with how frequently they were used.<p>Then the advent of computers and typing made stroke count mostly irrelevant.",1409213064

I'm in my thirties, and I certainly had lots of fun at my previous job (MSFT, on developer tools), but none of it compared with either my undergraduate or Ph.D. student experiences. That also seems to be true for most of my colleagues and friends --- who have done the startup sold for lots of money, big smash-hit video games, part of the i* device releases from day 1, etc.<p>All of the faculty I know really love it as well. Certainly, I hear bad things from the assistant (untenured) faculty, but all of the folks I meet who've made it over the hurdle seem to really love their work and have a lot of fun.<p>Are non top-tier universities really that bad?

3685622,comment,3683750,3683750,2,0,georgieporgie,,,"On the subject of ethics, I've been looking into Modafinil (Provigil, etc) lately.  If you're unfamiliar with it, it's a drug which eliminates the cognitive effects of sleepiness.  Its current approved use is for treatment of narcolepsy.  The effects last for around eight hours, and the drug doesn't induce jitters or negatively impact decision making.  Quoting off the top of my head, a military test showed sleep-deprived helicopter pilots operating within 17% of their well-rested accuracy after 36 hours of continuous duty.  It <i>can</i> be used to stay awake for very long periods, but it's more interesting for its effects in normal waking periods.  Not only does it prevent sleepiness, it increases focus and seems to have anti-depressant properties.<p>I'm pretty well convinced that over the next decade we'll see this and similar drugs proliferate among white collar jobs.  Let's face it:  our work is boring and the body is not well adapted to it.  It's difficult to keep the mind engaged when the body thinks it's a good time to nap or chat with the tribe.<p>If you look back at photos of the space race, two things are likely to be prominent:  coffee and cigarettes.  The brilliant engineers who put men on the moon using slide rules also dosed themselves with stimulants in order to maintain focus.  These days, cigarettes are on the wane, and something will need to replace and improve upon them.<p>A common criticism is, ""what if everyone is on them?""  Well, so what if they are?  The automatic assumption is that we'll all be working 16 hour shifts, but I don't see any reason to expect that.  If I can maintain focus and do a day's worth of highly productive work in four hours, why not expect the work day to drop to four or six hours (six giving a net benefit to the employer) over time?",1331322540

3685601,comment,3683987,3684649,13,0,rcthompson,,,"Well, the story concept isn't exactly original. Accidentally self-aware robots on the run from the law (or in this case, soon to be on the run) are a pretty common Sci-Fi staple, and the explanation for how it happens is rarely much more plausible than ""oops, someone pushed the 'become sentient' button"" or ""oops, static electricity reconfigured the circuits to become sentient"".<p>In any case, the specific script employed in the demo is designed to demonstrate a wide range of emotions in a short span of time, including happiness, wonderment, surprise, disappointment, terror, pleading, and gratefulness, so that the game engine can show off its ability to accurately portray all of these emotions in real-time rendering. To get such a wide emotional range in a short time, you pretty much have to throw in something traumatic.<p>So yes, it's an unrealistic scenario. It's not supposed to be plausible. Any scenario with an accidentally self-aware AI is almost guaranteed to be unrealistic. And yes, it's creepy, especially once she explicitly mentions her sexual submissiveness. But it accomplishes the goal of being a tech demo for rendering human (or human-like) emotions in real-time on current technology. In doing so, it very intentionally employs an unoriginal storyline that more or less recycles the current pop-culture view of artificially intelligent AI's, because the story is really just an excuse to demonstrate real-time rendered emotions. If you're looking for moral and ethical progressiveness, a tech demo may be the wrong place to look.",1331322133

3685596,comment,3684825,3684825,1,0,ColinD,,,"Having tried it out for just a few moments, I certainly see the value.  Good work.<p>That said, I do have a couple of <i>snap</i> judgements that I hope you don't mind me sharing.<p>1. The interface is simple to use, but when I closed a deal it immediately disappeared from the list.  While it makes sense for a non-active deal to leave the list, it is a hinderance to me using the platform.  In my business, ""closing"" a deal means receiving a purchase order.  But the deal isn't done until I've completed my end of things (bringing in the product, shipping it, receiving payment).  It would be nice if closed deals didn't disappear from the list for a day or week or month or whatever.  It's nice to see the team's successes as well as the stuff still open.<p>2.  It would be AWESOME if there were a way to add/edit the progress bar.  In my business it would be useful to have ""lead"" ""pitch/quotation"", ""negotiation"", ""closed"", ""processed"" ""shipped and invoiced"" and ""payment received.""  Tracking the whole process linearly from start to finish is something I would certainly pay for.<p>2. Piggy backing #1, it would be super helpful to be able to attach files to deals.  Most of my company's projects take place via quotes that come via XLS and PO's that come via PDF.  Being able to attach the files along the way would mean my GMAIL account wouldn't have to be the repository for quotes and orders.<p>2a. Tagging deals would be super useful.  If I could tag a deal with the salesperson's name or ""new customer"" or whatever and search/sort by tag, that would be a great feature.<p>3. The reporting is nice, but I hope that a lot more filters come in the future.  It would be nice to search/sort by customer, $ value, deal status, etc. and then run reports on that information as well.  For example, it would be nice to pull all the deals we lost from customer XYZ between $5k and $10k and compare that number to the deals won in that range.  Were are margins too high on the lost deals?  Is there something else we could have done?<p>4.  I don't know if you guys are enabling multi-user accounts but I'd gladly pay 5x your current monthly cost (or more) if would allow my account to have 4 user logins where each user could modify/edit a deal.  We have a salesperson, a quoter, a purchaser, and a processer.  If each person could access the same dashboard and update their part of a deal that would be fantastic and would no doubt improve our work flow.<p>5.  I'd pay even more if I could add checkbox/lists to each piece of the status bar.  So ""Pitch"" would have a checkbox for ""emailed quote"" and ""2 day follow up"" and 4 day follow up""...whereas Won might have a checkbox for ""received PO"" and ""created invoice"" and stuff like that.  I realize that is sort of moving away from the simplicity that the app delivers on right now, but once again it is something I would pay a lot more $$ for.  Aside from improving our current work, having checklists would help standardize our processes to make it easier to train new people.<p>My team of four is CONSTANTLY in the dark about where everyone else is on a certain project.  Task lists and project managers don't work because they are either complicated to use or don't have a linear flow like your tool has.<p>Yes, a lot of these things can be addressed through other CRM systems and Quickbooks, but the opportunity I see here is for dead simple deal tracking and data extraction.  Highrise, Salesforce, etc. are good tools in their own way, but a STRICT focus on pipeline, tracking, and highly/quickly customizable reporting would be great.<p>I realize that I've broken the cardinal rule by suggesting you add MORE stuff when the goal is simplicity.  But the things I've posted are the things that occurred to me right away when I signed up, started using it, and started saying ""would I pay for this?  How much would I pay?  And if it had x, y, and z, how much more would I pay?""",1331322000

Given the rest of this seems serious, I have to believe it too is serious, and I don't understand how this can lead to good code.  Some functions simply have more than 10 lines of logic.  In these cases, to follow that rule would either involve A) breaking up the code into other functions because ""that's the rule"" or B) combining lines of code unnecessarily, making the code less readable.

If you are linking to the kernel, you are considered to be part of the kernel, and thus you are expected to keep abreast of any ABI changes (preferably by getting your module into the kernel tree, so that anyone changing the ABI can fix your code too).<p>The Debian kernel team tries to do a reasonable job of tracking kernel ABI compatibility changes, and updating the number when the ABI does change, to avoid having to recompile and reinstall everything for every patch to the stable tree. In this case, they decided that the ABI change was only intended for a single, in-tree module (KVM), and that they didn't have to increment the ABI number for a change that shouldn't affect anything else.<p>This is really just an example of the Linux kernel developers' two approaches to compatibility. For the kernel ABI, they make no guarantees whatsoever about compatibility.

And, of course, voice communication. Web browsing, reading eBooks, etc. is quite difficult on the small screen, retina-display notwithstanding. I <i>always</i> have my phone with me.<p>The iPad tends much more to web browsing, sending email (it's difficult to send an email of any length on a phone, much easier on the iPad), playing games, etc. I have it sitting next to my couch and when watching a ""live"" TV show (you know, the things with commercials) I'll absent-mindedly pick up the iPad and thumb through Tweets or HN or Reddit etc. The battery life on the iPad is <i>considerably</i> better than my phone - so when I go on long trips I'll use the iPad as my time-killer. My iPad is within reach 100% of the time at home, and 100% of my time on vacation and long trips.<p>My MBA is used for hard-core web browsing (researching lots of data, figuring out problems = e.g. lots of task switching), programming, writing papers (the physical keyboard can't be beaten; I don't own a bluetooth keyboard so don't know if I'd write on the iPad), etc. I work on my laptop, but in general it stays put (strange, eh?).

QuantNet maintains a list of the top programs in the US:<p><a href=""https://www.quantnet.com/mfe-programs-rankings/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quantnet.com/mfe-programs-rankings/</a><p>But you should think very carefully about whether starting a new degree like this is worth it. Firstly, you'll notice that the tuition for all of these programs is very high, so there's a strong financial commitment to this.<p>More importantly, an MFE is extremely specialized; it's not like getting an MBA or an advanced degree in computer science, both of which will open doors for many opportunities. An MFE leads to a very limited set of employers since these programs don't teach the general programming or statistics or even finance skills that are widely applicable to other industries.<p>Lastly, without any prior experience in the field, a degree alone isn't very attractive to employers. And given the devastation that has occurred to the industry over the past few years, there are plenty of unemployed <i>experienced</i> people that you'll be competing with for jobs.<p>So you can go into a ton of debt for a degree with limited opportunities that likely won't come anyway.",1331320995

The original claim that the scanners are flawed doesn't strike me as explosive a revelation as it's being made out to be. My guess is the machines could be modified to change the background color behind the scanned person's silhouette.<p>The quote from the TSA (""Any guidance provided is to caution reporters not to generalize..."") is merely saying ""don't jump to conclusions on the basis of some activist's blog post/video,"" which is quite a reasonable ""cautionary"" statement. Sure, they're covering their ass some, but if they're truly being sued by this guy, they probably can't even get into things with him in the media anyway.<p>Granted, I have no love for the TSA, but some of this anti-TSA rhetoric seems like groping of a different kind.",1331320017

3685463,comment,3684624,3684944,3,0,morsch,,,"So (part of) your argument is that tablets in general have less <i>built-in utility</i>, and iOS tablets have access to a huge range of apps and content to make them useful than other tablets don't have access to. While that's true right now, I don't see why this will be the case in the next couple of years.<p>First off, apps: I would expect an increasing number of apps to be released multi-platform, for iOS and and Android and possibly for Windows P.O.S., because hey, why <i>not</i> release it multi-platform? The web is an important special case of multi-platform development and Google is keen on establishing web apps as just apps, too.<p>And content: While Apple owns a huge amount of the market, they don't own the actual content and I don't see why the content owners would restrict themselves to just one distributor. They'd reach a wider audience and they might even get a better deal if there's competition on the market.<p>The situation with the iPad might be similar to the iPod, but I don't think it's because of the content ecosystem. As you say, there are many other ways of obtaining MP3s, including many legal ones. I'm sure Google Music or Play or whatever they're calling it now will be just as convenient. It's a bit similar in that the iPods were always iconic. I don't want to play up the status symbol angle because I think it's exaggerated; the point is that to many people an iPod was almost synonymous with MP3 player, and at least it was the default option. The same seems to be true with the iPad.",1331319974

Perhaps in context you mean ""all copyable digital goods should be offered for very cheap prices."" I'm not sure I agree with that. Either way I'm not sure that it implies, by itself, that ""the cost of producing unprotected digital goods in general can only be covered by selling some non-digital good or service in conjunction with it.""<p>(3) No. In my second paragraph I am explicating the two ways that I see to understand your original statement: the narrow way (""people will not pay for bits period"") which is wrong, and the broad way (""people can always be viewed as paying for something other than the bits, like the service to access the bits or the authenticity of getting the bits from some official retailer"") which I think doesn't really rule out any particular payments for any particular practices. I have no idea what exactly you're trying to ""rule out"".<p>This is all complicated by the fact that as far as I can tell, these are apparently beliefs which you are trying to ascribe to me. That misunderstands the point of my analogy, which is that there is no ""free rider"" problem generated particular to digital goods sans artificial scarcity. A ""free rider"" problem occurs when nobody wants to pay to maintain a service. The point of the water analogy is twofold: first, it is to show the absurdity of worrying about free-riders when there is little to no maintenance cost. Second, it is to show how trying to punish those so-called ""free riders"" is just going to alienate people who might otherwise like you.<p>(4) That's why I didn't say that they sold digital goods. o_O.",1331319664

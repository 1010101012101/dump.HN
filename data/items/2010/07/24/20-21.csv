1544356,comment,1543717,1544166,0,0,silencio,,,"Agreed. Even worse are the comments talking about how difficult Mandarin/Chinese is to learn compared to English, so let's just stick to Spanish and French. Well, I wonder just how many people learned English or a similar language as their first language. Some people fluent in some languages are going to find another that is completely different to be difficult. Welcome to reality. (Although if my high school foreign language classes were any indication, similarity of languages was something most people had a very hard time grasping...only a few could see that Spanish/French/Portuguese had some things in common and took advantage of that to learn languages faster. We had a mandatory Spanish 1/French 1 freshman year curriculum, and some people just struggled the whole year long and chose the language they struggled with less for the next year.)<p>> In this day and age of internationalization, exposure to a variety of cultures beyond what's within walking distance is extremely important.<p>My first languages were English and Korean, and I had no difficulty whatsoever in a couple semesters' worth of Mandarin classes, and I'd like to think I can hold some kind of basic conversation in Mandarin and understand basic written Chinese text. The downside of trying to use my knowledge though, is realizing just how little i18n/L10n support there is in applications out there (for starters...TextMate completely fails because it assumes fixed-width - see <a href=""http://img.skitch.com/20100724-kcjdt411djee6u59p4pc9x5qe6.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://img.skitch.com/20100724-kcjdt411djee6u59p4pc9x5qe6.jp...</a>). If for that reason only, hackers should care :)<p>For what it is worth, I've taken a bunch of language courses just for the hell of it. Languages intrigue me, even if I never end up speaking it ever again (ask me how often I speak Spanish in Los Angeles....never...). I never did it for any economic advantage, I'm probably never going to spend more than a week of my life in China as a tourist, but it's interesting. I can walk around in Chinatown and understand what signs say, I know how to address people correctly, et cetera. That's all.",1280005067

In Russian language words (verbs, nouns, etc.) often can freely swap their position in sentence without changing meaning of the sentence (just slightly changing emphasis).

I think things like Google Gears will be a big help with this sort of thing. But it should also be possible to write smart client-side libraries that let you you modify objects locally and only sync when they can. That would certainly be fine for new objects you create, and for tags you have control over, but would be more involved if you (and others) were offline changing tags over which you all had control. Those kinds of things tend to run into difficult issues - which is mainly why I say I don't know how to solve this (fully). Running a mini client-side FluidDB shouldn't be too hard, especially with things like sqlite being built into some browsers. But again, lots and lots of details.....",1280004544

The Aravind Eye Care and similar success stories are all about innovation in the model of delivering healthcare. They excel in lowering costs through scale while ensuring high standards. The founder of Aravind was inspired by the process standardization of McDonald's and succeeded in replicating that in healthcare. The doctors at Aravind are actually considered to be among the best in the world simply because they perform far more surgeries than doctors elsewhere. Others like Narayana Hrudayalaya are replicating the model in areas like treatment of heart disease in India with great success.

While not entirely appropriate, for the sake of communication commonly agreed upon terminology is used by politicians and the media.<p>Yes, the taxation of property needs to be tied to market value, but it needs to be capped in some manner to prevent abuse.  For example, pro-rating the tax against a sliding scale based on income.<p>The problem is that people get old.  Bizarre concept, I know.  Once people retire, their incomes tend to be fixed.  As property tax rises uncontrolled (and unpredictably) year to year, the people that are the foundation of the community are forced out.

1544302,comment,1543885,1544131,0,0,Locke1689,,,"Actually, a ""wealth cap"" is not such a ridiculous idea. Essentially, it's simply a progressive income tax with a tax bracket at 100%. If the bracket is high enough, e.g. $200 million, then it doesn't act as a disincentive and helps to balance the imperfectness of the market.<p>Many would cite John Rawls here, but I have my own criticisms and my philosophical debates (I am a philosophy minor) can run into weeks of time. Instead, I'm going to simply make the argument that wealth over $200 million is meaningless to a single person. That is, from a practical perspective, that is more money than one could ever spend. The only positive use that could come from that amount of money is heavy watched investment and philanthropy. It is not easy to see that $1 billion is enough to move the world. Why should that responsibility fall into a single citizen's hands? In the best circumstances, the citizen hires a flotilla of people to manage that wealth (e.g., Gates and Buffet) and they spend it wisely and do great good. I don't see the fundamental reason why the government couldn't just do the exact same thing. By awarding the money of a government to a single person (Gates and Buffet each had, at the height of their wealth, more money than most of the governments in the world), this simply ensures an entrenched oligarchy of the rich (and therefore powerful) unless they decide to give it away.<p>Many would argue that this is ""their"" money so they deserve it. I think this argument is mostly bollocks, though. Bill Gates had over $100 billion at one point. Let's say that a skilled professional makes ~$1 million (gross) over the same time period. That's a 100,000x multiplier. Did Gates really do 100,000x more work? Did he really have 100,000x more insight? I think he just got lucky. He was at the right time at the right place with a good idea. From there he built a company. But the trick is that it's a lot easier to make a lot of money when you already have a whole lot of money.<p>Anyway, I'm gonna end this here, even though I'm not completely satisfied with my argument because this is becoming ridiculous.<p>P.S. This is not for those who believe that the government can do nothing right. I'm not sure that it's even worth arguing with those people. Theoretically, there's no satisfying proof that that's the case and practically the only evidence I see is that when those same people set the government up to fall, it falls hard.",1280002680

I mostly just needed help over a few humps (""What are these symbol things? How do blocks work? Wait, you mean <i>everything</i> is an object?""), and then it started to come together pretty nicely.<p>The biggest hurdle in learning Rails, IMO, is that it is such opinionated software. It does <i>so much</i> for you if you follow convention, and the newbie follows conventions because the tutorial says to, and has this <i>holy pogo-sticking africanized honey bees, what the dong just happened?</i> experience.

See this:<p><a href=""http://www.sigmod.org/sigmod-pods-conferences/mirrors/sigmod2008/sigmod_research.shtml.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sigmod.org/sigmod-pods-conferences/mirrors/sigmod...</a><p>There's also an interesting FAQ about the repeatability requirements specifically here:<p><a href=""http://www.sigmod.org/sigmod-pods-conferences/mirrors/sigmod2008/sigmod_repeatability_faq.shtml.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sigmod.org/sigmod-pods-conferences/mirrors/sigmod...</a><p>... as well as various follow-ups from that work, if you search on Google Scholar.<p>The issues as I understand them are:<p>1.  Research code is often of poor quality, usually thousands of lines of unchecked output by a single graduate student.  There are probably bugs, some of which may change the results.  In the absence of code, results are assumed to be correct.  It takes substantially longer to write good code, and hurts researcher ""output"" to do so.  As a result, good quality code is actively discouraged.<p>2.  Releasing code and/or data usually makes it substantially easier for others to duplicate or catch up to your research program, which is seen as a disadvantage if you are still in an area.  It may lead to more citations, but that probably isn't enough for the effort.  Other researchers also have an incentive to try to find bugs in the code/data, which they may overstate as they try to get their own work accepted.<p>3.  The code and/or data itself my be copyrighted or have unclear distribution terms, for example, if you are doing experiments on a web crawl.<p>4.  Actual production quality code that does something useful can be used as the basis of a startup or other venture, especially if the researcher is the only one who has and understands it.  Furthermore, research groups can make money licensing their code to outside companies if they do not release it openly.<p>5.  Many (most?) industrial papers involve code or data that cannot be released.  Ultimately, in highly competitive conferences, it is hard to balance ""unverifiable"" papers written by industry with academia papers.  A blanket ban on papers without code or data would remove a huge number of industry contributions, but an optional requirement for code or data mostly continues the status quo.  Many of the most interesting recent papers (e.g., MapReduce) might not have been published with a code/data requirement.",1280002418

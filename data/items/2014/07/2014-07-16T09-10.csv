The fact you (browser vendors) have to decide which image formats to support should be a huge red flag demonstrating that something is fundamentally wrong with your platform.<p>Many things of interest developers might want to do currently require co-operation from the browser vendors, and their default position is &#x27;no&#x27; unless it is in their commercial interest. Also, any one of the browser vendor vetoing the proposal is enough to kill it. Apple/Google/Microsoft are all huge companies with many products, so it&#x27;s quite likely that you are a direct competitor to at least one product from one of the browser vendors, giving them extra incentive to veto most of the time.<p>Until the web is a platform where the vendors don&#x27;t have the power to veto basic functionality like decoding an image it will remain the plaything of the browser vendors, used to bludgeon their competition.",1405504732

If an array lookup is known to be secure <i>at compile time</i>, then LLVM already optimizes out bounds checking without the need of a fast mode [1].<p>If there is not enough evidence available to the compiler that \n a particular array lookup is not safe, then that evidence is also not available to the programmer. Therefore, one would have to write a manual bounds check anyway. Double bounds checking, one by the compiler and one by the compiler, can also be optimized out.<p>Maybe Rust is not capable of completely covering all optimization cases right now, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a need for a turn-off-all-checks mode.<p>Does anybody have any material about how a turn-off-all-checks-mode improved performance for another language?

Joe certainly tries not to telegraph such things for obvious reasons.<p>From what I&#x27;ve gathered, through methods like &quot;pinging&quot; the market with many tiny transactions in likely spots, Bill can sound out what Joe is doing in the sheep market. Supposedly the market exchange will also &quot;flash&quot; the information about buy and sell orders to the HFT&#x27;s in favorable network locations a few ms faster than the general public as well. Figuring out that Joe is buying sheep are what all of the &quot;brilliant minds&quot; that are heading into HFT everyone is talking about are doing. They&#x27;re watching the road for Joe.\nAlso Joe is not a small investor, he&#x27;s a rancher that buys lots of sheep. Small investors don&#x27;t place the kind of orders that HFT can attack.<p>Do note that this metaphor really only applies to the Front Running section of HFT, and really evolved from a fanciful attempt to coagulate network layer and application layer solutions into one magical unicorn fix.

8041306,comment,8039818,8039818,2,0,powatom,,,"In my experience, a pay-rise is rare unless there is direct pressure from you, or the company believes that they&#x27;d be worse off if you were given a better offer elsewhere.<p>If you have no leverage, then it&#x27;s not in the company&#x27;s interests to pay you any more money. It sounds like you&#x27;ve at least queried the lack of a pay-rise, so some options might be:<p>1: Demand a pay-rise outright. You&#x27;re being asked to take on more responsibility and accountability with a &#x27;promotion&#x27;. It&#x27;s only fair that your greater sacrifice is rewarded with greater compensation.<p>2: Negotiate terms of your new contract - additional benefits, or a guaranteed pay-rise after x amount of time, or something else you&#x27;d like.<p>3: Find an external offer, then use that as a negotiating tool. If they really want to keep you, they&#x27;ll find a way to strike a deal. If not, then at least you can move elsewhere.<p>Basically this argument that &#x27;you&#x27;re 100% at your current level, but only 85% at the next level&#x27; is bollocks. If the new role is more responsibility, more accountability, and generally more demanding and difficult to do well, then that should be reflected in the compensation. No ifs or buts - anything else is simply taking advantage of people.<p>A lot can happen in a year - particularly the stresses of taking on more responsibility and having to be more accountable - do they really think it&#x27;s fair that you should be forced to do this for no extra pay? In a year, what&#x27;s stopping them &#x27;promoting&#x27; you again to an even more difficult job but where you&#x27;re only at &#x27;50% of the benchmark&#x27;?<p>It&#x27;s a load of horse-shit.",1405504275

This seems ethically just about OK to me but a sign that there is not one single stockmarket and that the system could be far better designed.<p>There is the single front-running trade which is suspicious but it seems plausible (unless it happens every time) that it was just a small random trade that happened to coincide with the timing of the big trade. It should be monitored though.<p>My conclusions:<p>1. There is not one single market with a number of available shares but a number of linked markets. Send your trade to a single exchange (first at least) with enough offered shares that it should execute before offers can be cancelled. Wait, repeat.<p>2. Much of the liquidity supposedly offered by HFT is illusory and disappears if you try to use it.<p>I think that the market could probably be improved if cancellation weren&#x27;t free or at least weren&#x27;t instant. If cancellations took a second (maybe 100ms or 10ms would be enough) to process and the offers could still be accepted in that period the offers made would be more serious and although the spread might be slightly larger it would more honestly reflect reality.",1405503770

Also in nice formalisms for inference in general, so perhaps that will be a useful side-effect of this work.<p>It&#x27;s the idea of full-blown probabilistic <i>programming</i>, where  you have unconstrained turing-complete non-deterministic programming language and inference just works, where I&#x27;ve seen a bit more in the way of healthy skepticism.

It is awesome, it is actively maintained, it works great. It has around 100k active users.<p>- Some time later, &quot;philiKON&quot; (Philipp von Weitershausen) made a smaller extension that just shows tabs vertically. &quot;It is heavily inspired by and borrows ideas from the excellent Tree Style Tab add-on&quot;, its page says. I used it for a while, but it fell into disrepair and I switched back to TST. Vertical Tabs has around 5k users.<p>- Finally, &quot;Vlad&quot; made a fork of Vertical Tabs to fix it up a little, since philiKON had abandoned it.<p>So who does Mr. Henein credit? Mainly himself and his colleague Vlad. Vlad is credited as the author of Vertical Tabs at the beginning of the post, although what he was not &quot;something [Henein]’d be willing to trial&quot; (ouch). It needed Henein&#x27;s touch to &quot;bring this add-on to a level where users would find it delightful and usable enough to at least give it a fair shot.&quot;<p>But still, he does credit his pal Vlad for doing most of the work, and even throws in a mention of von Weitershausen in the middle of the post, without explaining what he has to do with Vertical Tabs.<p>No mention at all of Piro or Tree Style Tabs, even though it was the inspiration of Vertical Tabs, and to this day is used by orders of magnitude more people. In fact, its existence seems to be intentionally removed. &quot;The hypothesis I was hoping to validate was that there was a subset of the Firefox user base that would find value in the layout that Side Tabs enabled. I wanted to bring this add-on to a level where users would find it delightful and usable enough to at least give it a fair shot.&quot; I would say that TST, its over 2 million downloads over at least 7 years, and its 100k active users validate that hypothesis pretty well.<p>I think this is a pretty shoddy way for Mozilla to treat a member of its community. There is an add-on that introduced all of these ideas to Firefox, is well-known and appreciated by Firefox power-users, and has been tirelessly maintained for seven years, yet they go and act as if &quot;side tabs&quot; (he even slipped his own new name for it in there) were some amazing new area of cutting-edge experimentation, while giving a hat tip to a derivative of a derivative of the original extension.<p>And then all the flowery rhetoric: &quot;This is how great things are built; rarely from scratch, but more commonly on the shoulders and brilliance of those who came before you.&quot; &quot;I’ve had great response on Twitter from developers and users who love the add-on and who can’t wait to share their ideas and thoughts. It’s awesome to see ideas take shape and grow so organically like this. This is collaboration.&quot;<p>Maybe I&#x27;m crazy, but the whole thing just rubs me the wrong way.",1405502608

Maybe if I quickly pull it out of the shop window, and change the price, I can make some extra cash!&quot;<p>That&#x27;s what it is:  People are seeing the orders pour through the various exchanges, and are reacting to it.  If they were seeing the orders <i>before</i> they hit the exchanges, that would be front running, and it would be illegal.  But Nanex appears to be showing people responding to orders after they hit the exchanges, and that would seem to be legal and moral.<p>The moral is that if you want to buy so much of a single stock that you can&#x27;t even buy it all from a single exchange, you MAY end up paying a bit of a premium, unless you&#x27;re quite good at hiding what you&#x27;re doing.

Modeling user&#x27;s <i>intent</i> is one of the more difficult things in end-user development - it would be great to have a more-or-less standard way to infer what abstraction the user had in mind when introducing an example that ought to be generalized into a program.<p>Yesterday&#x27;s Program Synthesis Demo [1] with MS TouchDevelop shows that the approach is viable. What I find lacking in such systems is a way to <i>correct</i> the inferred program in those inevitable cases when the learning system guesses wrongly; having a language to model the possible explanations for the example would allow the user to tweak the program or give hints on how to correct it.<p>*[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8028620"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8028620</a>",1405501328

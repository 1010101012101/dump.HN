Advocates of functional programming claim a number of benefits for the absence of side-effects including a greater ease of reading and reasoning about the code and an increased ability to execute parts of a computation in parallel.""<p>You know I'm sympathetic to this line of thinking, but I wished he would have actually used this VM example to back up these statements.<p>Why is the version without mutable state better?  That's not explained at all.  I can think of some reasons why it would be worse -- e.g. more memory allocations.  For this VM, its semantics are inherently serial, so the concurrency argument doesn't apply.",1339981187

Unless the pricing model has changed significantly since the last time I bought it, I don't see it as that expensive. The licensing model is based on daily volume indexed but the licenses are perpetual.

Under President Obama, secure communities has deported more ""dangerous illegals"" than any other administration.<p>Talking with a friend who works at the county jail, this is the same protocol that was previously done by a human being, only made much more efficient by the data sharing initiative. Instead of having an officer look through a list of names for dangerous criminals, the system picks up people with really minor offenses.<p>To date my state of Washington has deported more people for having an expired fishing license than for murder.

Delaware is also a great state if you expect to have lots of litigation over your corporate structure or in regards to corporate management activities.<p>Delware is a horrible state for anyone else, especially minority shareholders.  The reason large companies and VCs love Delaware is because it allows them to run roughshod over minority/non-controlling investors in ways that are illegal in almost every other state.

For example, if you do business in California, you will generally be subject to California laws.

It will take more than a weekend with any tech platform to get to the point that you know enough to deploy an app in a week.<p>That said, with those rather sketchy specs, and no specification of what you already know, Django's on the short list, thanks to its rather nice and integrated admin interface.<p>For the MVP, if you're serious about the weekend timeframe, I'd suggest <i>considering</i> just sticking with Django's default SQL DB integration and where you see fit, slam some JSON blobs into the database and call it a day. I do mean ""considering"", it could go either way, but on that timeframe the extra several hours it could take to get something else running starts becoming significant percentages.<p>If you're willing to loosen up on the time frame a lot of other stuff becomes viable, but in terms of slamming it out now it's going to be difficult to <i>beat</i> Django... tie it, perhaps, but not beat it.<p>You should probably help us out by telling us what you already know at least a little, in terms of languages at the very least.",1305345500

2547094,comment,2546805,2546805,4,0,MJR,,,"Banks have spreadsheet level account information - debits, credits, categories and labels. Not a very broad set of information to parse. Most banks offered several common formats for this data and it was readily available online - albeit with some caveats. Health insurance on the other hand is nothing like that.<p>For example - Showing a BCBS logo is hardly representative of the 39 separate companies which are part of the BCBS Association. Good luck trying to wrangle connecting to each of these companies and then trying to decipher the individual plan-level benefits of thousands of customized plans at each specific insurer. Employer's routinely customize benefits for their employee offered plans. These benefits are detailed in your benefit booklet or member guide which you probably get by mail and maybe have access to in a PDF online. Parsing and then reporting on that info is a tall order and that's if you can even get access to it.<p>This is in addition to the legal hoops that you'll have to jump through to even explore the ramifications of transferring PHI(Personal Health Information) from insurers and storing it elsewhere. Once explored you have to get permission to acquire this information - another difficult hurdle if its even possible.<p>TLDR - They're in for a long climb up a very steep hill.",1305344374

2547081,comment,2543191,2544139,4,0,vsrinivas,,,"Hi,<p>If you're interested in reading a paper about the execution model, Jeffrey Hsu's 2004 ""The DragonFlyBSD Operating System"" (<a href=""http://www.dragonflybsd.org/presentations/dragonflybsd.asiabsdcon04.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dragonflybsd.org/presentations/dragonflybsd.asiab...</a>) describes the LWKT and port abstractions.<p>The DragonFly network stack is a pretty interesting subsystem to understand the SMP model through; it uses a form of connection-oriented parallelism rather than fine-grained locks. The same approach was taken by Solaris in their FireEngine system (they call it 'vertical partitioning'). References that would be interesting to look at to understand how the netstack works, ""An Evaluation of Network Stack Parallelization Strategies\nin Modern Operating Systems"", along with the second part of the earlier paper. FreeBSD chose to build a fine-grain-locked netstack in a style the paper above called 'Message Parallelism'.<p>The DragonFly kernel memory allocator is another interesting subsystem to look at SMP design through. The kernel allocator (kmalloc) is a slab allocator, like most other kernel allocators. The DragonFly slab allocator differs from Bonwick's classic by using fixed size and fixed alignment slabs, so the traditional reverse-mapping hash table is not required; the slab headers are always at the slab ... head. The SMP strategy was not to put a per-CPU cache in front of each zone, however. The slab allocator itself was duplicated across each CPU (each slab for a given size is CPU-private). Remote frees were handled via passive IPIs (as described in the first paper). The only lock in the allocator is at the bottom, to allocate kernel address space and frames for slabs. Other systems (think Solaris, say) build per-CPU caches of objects in front of the allocator and lock the slab layer.<p>The pattern you might see is that DFly chose to replicate resources across each CPU in an SMP system where reasonable...<p>Throughout the rest of the kernel, Dfly uses a curious lock called a 'token'. A token lock is automatically released when a thread holding it stalls and is reacquired when it \nbecomes runnable; think of a token as a having the semantics of the older *BSD MPLOCK, but there can be more than one token, where there was one MPLOCK. Token locks can't deadlock (as sleep-and-hold is not possible; they do introduce a new class of error, though, where a lock ""holder"" slept, meaning earlier assumptions don't hold). They probably won't work as well as conventional mutexes when the token chains get larger than a few elements. Most importantly, they allowed the MPLOCK to be broken up very quickly, mostly over the 2.8 and 2.10 release cycles. \nDon't know that there is too much other there to read about tokens; there might be something in the XNU kernel notes about 'funnels' (which have similar semantics).<p>-- vs",1305343910

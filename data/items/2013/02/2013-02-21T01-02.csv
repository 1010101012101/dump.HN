5254865,comment,5254097,5254497,1,0,ekianjo,,,"> PC hardware improvements have really slowed dramatically since the 1990's and early 2000's.<p>Well you cannot double frequency anymore on chips if that is what you are referring to. But there are more and more cores, and GPUs is where the innovation is happening (and that's what matters with games). A 2 years old graphic card does not compare well with a new graphic card at the same price nowadays. I usually renew my PC hardware every 2 years or so and I definitely see the difference when I do in games and how well they run on the new config. And I stopped turning on my xbox and PS3 a while ago when I could have full HD games on my PC at great frame rates - playing on console then became slow (loading times) and ugly (certainly not as good as on PC).",1361411725

5254862,comment,5254097,5254725,4,0,networked,,,">-- OnLive/Gaikai style video streaming of full disc games you haven't yet purchased<p>What everyone seems to worry about here is that Sony can use this against piracy and/or game resale. Going streaming-only is a long-term direction that, if implemented right, could well improve Sony's bottom line and introducing it gradually is a great means for them to ensure gamers don't simply take their business elsewhere when it is the only option left.<p>Take the ability to stream older PS1-PS3 titles. Old titles can be a source of free money for a publisher like Sony but due to those titles' smaller size they are especially easy to pirate (according a torrent tracker the entire PSN PSX collection takes up around 58.7 GiB; that's 179 game titles for the PlayStation). Streaming would eliminate the possibility of this kind of piracy.<p>Still, I think you can make a strong argument that Sony won't implement a stream-only policy for games this generation since in the US, a key market, far too many of gamers just don't have the bandwidth yet.<p>>-- rolling video replay of your screen as a core system service<p>You've got to note that this feature will be ""free"" in terms of computational resources for every streamed game.",1361411690

However, academia really fosters a type of conservative innovation. You pick your battles, apply for grants that you think you can win (and hope for the best).<p>For the most part, you don't swing for the fences. You learn how to integrate yourself into a certain type of system, and you hang on until you graduate.

And DRM is only half the issue.  Kindle books can only be read on Amazon-offered hardware and software, unlike ePub which can be used by Sony Reader, Kobo's devices, and B&N's devices.  So it's not just DRM, it's file format too.  And I've railed for years about Amazon not going with ePub but have accepted they've basically won, although now with iOS devices in the half billion, they have some actual potential competition.

It has had some impact, but it's still going to be a long time.<p>That said, even some of the older folks in the legal field hate legalese. When I clerked for an appeals court judge, we used to do two things:\n1.  Read every single opinion out loud to all the clerks in order to make sure it sounded sane and was understandable to the other folks at the table, who had no idea what the case was about.\n2. Remove all unnecessary words and anachronisms.  The judge used to pull out his copy of strunk and white and beat us over the head with it.",1361410942

The statistics for success in academia are thoroughly against any one Ph.D. The competition is too high, the rewards are too low, and the competitors are too desperate. This is not a place where you wish to compete - unless you have some kind of overwhelming advantage - aka really, really brilliant - you know who you are.<p>For everyone else - look straight at industry - where the competition is a hell of a lot lower, the salaries much higher, and the competition is really not that bright. If you are getting a Ph.D - and you know you're not a genius - be looking at getting a cushy engineering job at a large firm.<p>The benefits are great, the salaries are great, the job security is great and you can always jump back into academia. It's also the closest analogue to academia as you'll get, next to research labs.<p>Don't ever compete on the same terms as the people around you. Don't play a game where you will lose - a game where you are probably outclassed. Go look to where you can charge monopoly pricing and extract as much as you possibly can.<p>Competing for limited resources is a losers game - hell, competition SUCKS BALLS (just ask any Chinese manufacturers you know :) - monopoly is where it's at (just ask AAPL/GOOG/MSFT/TSLA).<p>Separately - people should go out and learn some basic statistics, microeconomics (macro is pretty fucking useless), game theory and psychology.

My big ""ah-ha!"" moment came when I finally learned that the game started even before I sat down in a seat.<p>In a poker room at a casino, there are usually many different choices of tables. Each table has different stakes, different players, and different dynamics that change as the players come and go, and as players get excited, upset, or tired.<p>I learned that the most important decision I could make was which table to sit at. This included knowing when to change tables. I learned from a book that an experienced player can make ten times as much money sitting at a table with nine mediocre players who are tired and have a lot of chips compared with sitting at a table with nine really good players who are focused and don't have that many chips in front of them.<p>In business, one of the most important decisions for an entrepreneur or a CEO to make is what business to be in. It doesn't matter how flawlessly a business is executed if it's the wrong business or if it's in too small a market.<p>Imagine if you were the most efficient manufacturer of seven-fingered gloves. You offer the best selection, the best service, and the best prices for seven-fingered gloves--but if there isn't a big enough market for what you sell, you won't get very far.<p>Or, if you decide to start a business that competes directly against really experienced competitors such as Wal-Mart by playing the same game they play (for example, trying to sell the same goods at lower prices), then chances are that you will go out of business.<p>In a poker room, I could only choose which table I wanted to sit at. But in business, I realized that I didn't have to sit at an existing table. I could define my own, or make the one that I was already at even bigger. (Or, just like in a poker room, I could always choose to change tables.)<p>I realized that, whatever the vision was for any business, there was always a bigger vision that could make the table bigger.</i><p>Source: <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tony-hsieh/tony-hsieh-zappos-ceo-del_b_589543.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tony-hsieh/tony-hsieh-zappos-c...</a><p><i>> Instead, Falken and David direct the computer to play tic-tac-toe against itself.

There are plenty of open-source and commercial tools and libraries for developing games.  This means individual developers and startups can enter the industry relatively freely, with minimal upfront costs, can restore innovation to its rightful place, and can exert downward price pressure with their small costs.<p>I believe the number of games/developers/publishers in the ecosystem is larger than it ever was [citation needed], as is the revenue of the industry as a whole [citation needed], but A-list console and PC titles have given up a fair amount of ground to the ""long tail"" of modestly successful indie games.<p>[1] 1990's connection speeds, and the pesky business of tying up telephone lines for hours or days during long downloads, made yesterday's Internet an unappealing distribution platform.",1361408542

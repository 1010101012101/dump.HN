1414774,comment,1402045,1410645,0,0,prospero,,,"Every widget in Swing, WinForms, and pretty much every other last-gen interface framework is a big bundle of state.  First you instantiate the object, and then you make a series of function calls to set all the right toggles.<p>So far, this doesn't seem like much of an obstacle.  Clojure has (doto ...), which lets us trim some fat, so at least we're beating Java, right?  The problem, though, is that Java has tools which autogenerate this boilerplate, letting the programmer treat setup as an atomic step.  When writing it out by hand, you have to worry about the order of your calls, and that when you copy/paste some code you change all instances of layoutPanel1 to layoutPanel2, because otherwise you get the obscure NPE mentioned by the author.<p>The above problem is why the current-gen interface frameworks (WPF, GWT, and Android) all rely on XML schemas for high-level layout.  Schemas avoid a whole class of programmatic error that can arise in this initial setup, and can be sanity-checked in a number of ways thousands of lines of code cannot.<p>Unfortunately, this still doesn't solve the other problem: callbacks.  Callbacks are chock-full of side effects, and fragile for all the same reasons mentioned above.  There's no equivalent in a Swing scene graph to XPath or CSS selectors, which means that your code is closely coupled to the current hierarchy, and fragile if it changes.<p>What this all means is that it's hard to introduce very much abstraction into the creation or modification of Swing interfaces.  My theory, which I have not tested, is that if you modeled the initial interface as a schema, and forced callbacks to be purely functional modifications of that schema, it would be a much less painful experience writing UIs in Clojure.",1276021848

1414768,comment,1414560,1414560,0,0,mdasen,,,"I don't think there's a huge market for what Heroku does in the PHP world.  With Rails, you want to run it as a long-running process.  The amount of time to spin up a (Thin|Mongrel|Unicorn|etc.) is too long to do it based on a user request for a page and it's why Rails isn't run as a CGI.<p>PHP is a bit different.  The language is typically embedded in the server and then the individual files are parsed and run.  There's little configuration other than uploading the files since the server can just interpret the files ending in "".php"".<p>Heroku needs to be able to put your application code on multiple servers and know which servers are responsible for your application.  When one of your Thins isn't working, they need to kill it and spawn a new one, potentially on a new server and make sure they update their routing table.  It's a tad complicated.<p>PHP Fog doesn't have to do much. Heroku is running around 65,000 applications.  Assuming that applications are under 30MB (for the hard drive), a RAID-1 with 2TB drives on every server they have would do the trick with a simple load balancer sending requests to a random server would do the trick.  Your code is resident on their 15 app servers, a request comes in and gets routed to a random one, it parses your PHP and returns a response.  The application isn't in memory as a long-running process like it is with Rails.  Heroku already just has shared or dedicated database servers.  There's no fancy process monitoring that you need since you only have to ensure that Apache is still going strong.<p>But that's also why PHP Fog won't do as well.  They aren't taking on as difficult a challenge as Heroku.  They don't need to run something like god or monit to monitor lots of user processes.  They don't need to pre-spawn application servers.  They don't need fancy routing to keep track of what domain is being requested, what application belongs to that domain, and on what server that application is located. Because PHP doesn't usually involve long-running processes, it's taken care of for them. In fact, there are services like this already such as Rackspace's Cloud Sites (which puts your PHP or ASP code on multiple boxes, has a shared database, and loadbalances it).  The same situation exists with Media Temple's Grid Service.  Media Temple says, ""hundreds of servers for the price of one"".  That's possible because the application code takes up such little space and can be easily replicated since it doesn't store state. Rails and Django users on Media Temple have to buy a ""container"" which comes with a certain amount of RAM on a specific box - because they need to keep the application in memory.<p>Rails deployment will get a lot more people on board because it's more difficult to do.  You have to manage application processes.  PHP deployment is already seen as something that ""just works"".  And if someone is going to argue that this ""just works"" a little better, wait until different users are expecting different php.ini stuff - or they expect to be able to save to the local filesystem because that's what the code they downloaded does or do a highly insecure cross-domain require or all of the various things that can't ""just work"".<p>They could still be a very good webhost, but they aren't solving the same problem as Heroku and others (including Media Temple and Rackspace) have already gone the multi-server, auto-load-balanced and managed failover route for PHP (just not using git).",1276021710

As the author of the parent comment, let me see if I got this right...<p>1. In response to OP's post about fame and programming, I shared some of my innermost feelings about my vocation.  I absolutely believe that it's the software, not me, who is the star.  No matter how long I do this, I am still in awe of the entire process and thank my lucky stars that I was born when I was.  Energy comes to me from some unknown place, goes through my brain and finger tips, and results in this untouchable thing that affects so many lives.  What can be cooler than that?  I have never desired fame for this and only want to get paid properly and see my work put to good use.  (OK, an occasional pat on the back would be nice.)  I am perfectly content, and in fact function best, when the code is the star.  I shared these feelings, fully understanding that others may not feel the same.  Nothing I said was intended as ""advice"".<p>2. Others voted this comment up.  I can only hope that some of those people have shared my experience and feelings.<p>3. You presume to know what others were thinking when they voted, which is not what I hope they were thinking.<p>4. The purpose of the tshirt was <i>identification</i>.

I have stayed in touch with most of them even though I try to maintain my anonymity online.  The only question is why didn't I meet you?<p>Sorry you feel this way.  I don't need fame, but I do need to build cool stuff and I do need to see that it's going to good use.  I think that other programmers feel that way too.

Things I have to get off my chest, but which I know will make me look strange or cranky or childish, can come off in relative anonymity.  (And when I do get them off my chest, people respond more frankly, which helps.)<p>Second, I always knew there was something wrong with me socially, and I had the vague intention of improving at least as early as junior high.  At first my ideas were pretty vague, and my progress depended on a trickle of new ideas from the pop science reading I did.  Evolutionary psychology helped me see social relationships through ideas I already understood.  It was always popularized hand-in-hand with a really bleak and brutal view of life (the perception that EP was just the paranoia of sexually insecure men, dressed up in scientific language, was probably created by some of the books I read) so it may have hurt more than it helped.  Still, I started to get some insight into my limitations in high school.  Then the book <i>Emotional Intelligence</i> came out around the time I graduated, and I read it cover to cover several times.  It was just a self-help book, but it instantly clicked with me and gave coherence to a lot of half-formed ideas I had.  It gave me an agenda of concrete items I could improve on.  I remember there was a little section about how savvy kindergarten-age kids approached other children that actually helped me make friends in college.<p>Third, when I went to college I got a frame of reference for how normal, well-adjusted people who were informed and liberal would act.  Back in high school I really couldn't parse out which differences between myself and everybody else were due to me being better-informed, more critical, and more liberal and which differences were due to me being socially retarded.  Not only did I not really <i>like</i> the people around me, which made my social problems a lot more understandable than I realized at the time, I was literally afraid to emulate anybody around me because I might pick up customs that would make me look stupid when I finally broke out into the ""real"" wold.  College released me from that.  It's amazing how much more natural it is to emulate and learn from people you actually like, and whom you would like to <i>be</i> like.<p>Fourth, I realized that I had some emotional issues that were interfering with the proper functioning of my social skills.  I.e., I'm a lot more socially competent when I feel good about myself.  Trying to be social while you hate yourself is like trying to boot a computer with an inadequate power supply.

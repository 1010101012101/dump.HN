There's been plenty of instances of fake controversial legal threats/rejection letters/complaints that have been used to drive traffic or create a buzz about something.  If this is fake, I don't see how this person will really cash in on the buzz though.",1220572558

295334,comment,295311,295311,0,0,blogimus,,,"One wrinkle in calling defamatory online comments slander rather than libel is that even though the comment is  made offhand and then the discussion ""moves on"" (not formally thought out as a ""publication""), there is still a written record left behind. So in that respect, it is more like libel, unless the record left behind is considered more like a tape/video recording than a written account.",1220571886

How about if that developer pulls his head out of his ass? I'm sure I'll get modded down for this. Whatever.<p>I am by no means an Apple zealot. In fact, I think the iPhone is pretty lousy. But why is it that so many people feel like they have a right to have their application sold in the iPhone App Store? Store owners do get to pick and choose what they're going to sell. You can't just come up with whatever lame product, show up at Best Buy or Amazon headquarters and demand that they start selling it in their stores. What in the world makes this guy or anyone else think the App Store is somehow an exception?<p>They weren't jerks about it either. They tactfully told this guy that his app was worthless and explained how he could distribute it to friends and family. He's lucky an application called ""Pull My Finger"" was even reviewed in the first place.<p>If people are unhappy with App Store policies then maybe the conditions are right for a competitor to come along and open a store. Of course, there's the whole issue of lock-in, but that's a whole different topic. The last thing we should be doing is feeling some sense of entitlement. It's Apple's store and they can choose what products to carry. As consumers we can choose whether or not to buy their products.",1220571751

I use Dropcard about a few times a week. These guys have made it extraordinarily easy to send a digital business card that you can easily add to any address book. Just try it. It will take you less than 15 minutes to get set up. I’ll certainly be using it at TC50 next week.<p>Vuzit is a great idea backed by great technology. Some people really are looking for a white label solution for viewing documents and don’t want their documents hosted at Scribd or Docstoc which have more of a YouTube model. They’ve also got some features you won’t find elsewhere.<p>Anthilllz also has some great potential. LinkedIn lets you recommend others, but this entire site is built upon your recommendations and others’ opinions of you. Imagine you’re looking for a new web designer. What is more important, a LinkedIn profile (essentially a resume) or a place that has truly honest reviews? If Anthillz is successful at building out its network through its “Trusted Colleagues” feature (which is a great viral feature), then you’ll find it quickly become a place where people’s reputations live and die.<p>I can’t really speak to the other companies as I’m not too familiar, and I think that maybe some of the ideas for some of those companies might be a little flaky from these summaries, but there are some very promising companies in the bunch. They may not ever be huge, but they can certainly be successful.",1220571128

295302,comment,295068,295173,0,0,aconbere,,,"I'm a bit confused about where you're coming from here. They could certainly have attempted to license v8 but since the bulk of what they have going on are extension of the already open sourced WebKit rendering engine that would have been difficult.<p>Now they certainly could have written their own rendering engine, but if time has shown anything it's that this is not easy task (look at the lag time between release to market and efficient rendering for any of the big engines). And in this case it would have likely meant the death of the project to step out with an inefficient root rendering engine.<p>Okay... so let's assume the above. They are forced to open source the components that link in with Web Kit, but they keep the Javascript VM closed and license that. We now get to throw into contention that there is any significant cash flow available to license. I think that's certainly suspect.<p>So finally let's think about why google might not care. This isn't about making a money move. Much like releasing IE back in the 90's wasn't a money move for MS. It is however a platform move. Google has a number of very resource intensive javascript applications, a number of which are common for people to have open at the same time. That requires have a better framework for dealing with these kinds of tasks. Chrome is an attempt to provide that.<p>It's not even clear if this is a serious browser bid, or more of a road map for other browser vendors to emulate. In the end it doesn't matter. Google's revenue stream requires eyeballs, lots of them. And the eyeballs are asking for better performance, Chrome is a means to that end.",1220569782

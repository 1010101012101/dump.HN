The only thing Seiki has is pixel density and cheapness, it is awful in every other measurable way, without a doubt one of the worst panels I have ever purchased. I can&#x27;t fathom how you can justify calling it &quot;good&quot;. Excluding resolution -- can you even name a single thing you like about it, that you think is a cut above?<p>Do you have an ax to grind, or is this just typical HN pedantry?<p>The reviews on Amazon for this display is a solid 4.0 from 200+ reviews -- hardly the shite quality you seem to be suggesting.  Given that the thesis of the article is that this would be great for programmers (i.e. not designers or the color obsessed), the fervor to which you&#x27;re arguing the point seems misplaced.",1389405590

It was presented as non-evaluative, but it involved a fair number of behavioral questions and a case study. I&#x27;m guessing those questions weren&#x27;t just my interviewer&#x27;s way of making small talk.<p>I had a great time visiting the company, and I ended up with an offer. (Ultimately I decided to go elsewhere, mainly for family reasons that were pressing at the time.) But the lunch interview was completely draining.<p>By the end of the lunch I&#x27;d eaten about two bites of salad. Needless to say, my blood sugar tanked, and it&#x27;s amazing I made it through the rest of the day. :)",1389405568

I got a message from someone down in the Atom V&V group in Austin that they were interested in bringing me down for an additional interview, and that was the end of communications.  I never got a response to any of the follow-up emails I sent.<p>Strangely, I got an email from someone in HR down in Austin about a year later that was very similar to the one I got after the Dallas interview event.

Google&#x27;s present business model is based on logging <i>enormous</i> amounts of personally identifiable data.  Your search history for at least 18 months.  Cross-correlation between Search, YouTube, Gmail, G+, and other services.  And on and on.  I detail much of this in the blog entry linked.<p>DDG <i>could</i> be forced to put an upstream intercept which would log searches by specific IPs, but that&#x27;s outside their normal operational scope.  It also applies only to data-on-the-wire, not data-at-rest.  In Google&#x27;s case, your aggregated history is sitting on their servers to be collected at any time.<p>If you don&#x27;t trust DDG not to log your searches, going through Tor will give you yet another degree of separation (there are also browser extensions such as DisconnectSearch:  <a href""https://disconnect.me/searc"" rel""nofollo"">https://disconnect.me/search</a>).<p>As sobering as the disclosures from Snowden, Applebaum, and others have been, the news appears to be that cryptographic methods <i>do</i> work to protect privacy or at the very least <i>greatly</i> increase workload for surveillance.<p>And another aspect is that by encouraging and promoting alternatives to Google, we&#x27;re carving out at least a small niche in which privacy-focused entrants to a vastly concentrated search market (Google scores in the neighborhood of 85% of all search according to some metrics I&#x27;ve seen) might be able to thrive.",1389405447

You also get nice things like macros, auto-escaping, and caching with a template engine, and you would probably end up having to reimplement a lot of that at some point anyway.<p>Although what Laravel uses (blade) for templating looks pretty close to bare PHP, so there&#x27;s plenty of room for minimal abstraction.<p>But all of it is light-years ahead of the nightmare that is typical legacy PHP.",1389405062

That you want more women leaders because you want the decision makers to have less biases and blindsights, on average. Perhaps you also want more men elementary school teachers because you want more male role models for children, and perhaps less chances of biased behaviour towards schoolchildren based on gender. Not just because you want the men who are already wanting to be elementary teachers to have an easier time. These two seem more important on the societal level than bringing more women in to tech and more men into nursing.<p>Secondly, this looks similar to the argument that &#x27;men are over represented in positions of power, so men are better off as a whole&#x27;. This assumes that men are a collective soup that automatically benefits from being collectively better off. Perhaps by assuming that more men in positions of wealth and power means that all men have an easier time getting into it, ignoring that men come from different backgrounds and social classes and may not ever get a shot at something like that, anyway. I doubt that many have the conundrum of becoming a big-shot CEO, or taking on a high-risk fisherman job because he needs the risk premium (yes, you&#x27;ve probably already read about men being over-represented in some jobs that aren&#x27;t really featured items on &#x27;career day&#x27;. They come up often enough in these threads). Another assumption behind this is that men necessarily benefit from other men being in power. That&#x27;s a problematic assumption. Why would all men necessarily benefit from that? In fact, assume that a man in power things of women as inferior, and only think that men are a threat to his position of power; then he has a motivation to keep men down, or at least the swaths of men that aren&#x27;t immediately useful to him.",1389403619

7040898,comment,7039043,7039043,2,0,shawnee_,,,"The tone of this article is pretty defensive and borders on hostile.  Understandably?  Yeah, it sucks when people misinterpret a sentiment or take something out of context, but if you really want an open discussion about why there aren&#x27;t more female founders, acknowledge your part.  There&#x27;s a dearth of female founders because YC and angels and VCs are just <i>not as willing to fund females.</i>  Until 1974 --  when the Equal Credit Opportunity Act was passed -- they weren&#x27;t even willing to give women a credit card in her own name.<p><pre><code>  source:  http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/6500-1200.html\n</code></pre>\nThe issue here isn&#x27;t about Legos vs Barbies.  It <i>isn&#x27;t</i> entirely about lack of CS majors or women in STEM; nor is because women don&#x27;t know code.  Successful founders make wise choices with capital, investing in people / ideas / things that have likelihood to build long-term value. This should be the only criteria for deciding who to fund, but VCs don&#x27;t see it that way.<p>We were not angry that the application I (early 30&#x27;s F) and my cofounder (early 20&#x27;s F) submitted was rejected from the last YC application process.  But we were pretty confused.  It&#x27;s an emerging green-tech niche in an industry <i>beyond</i> primed for some technical disruption.  Maybe I don&#x27;t have CS degree, but I did earn a master&#x27;s in a male dominated field. Over these last 10 years or so have learned enough to write all the code for our prototype.   My cofounder went to Cornell.  With just a tiny bit of help, we could have built something great.  But instead she&#x27;s interning at a newspaper, making $10 an hour, and I&#x27;m getting &quot;it&#x27;s just not a great fit&quot; rejection emails.<p>We decided that we were about 95 percent certain that if it had been 2 guys applying with this idea, YC would have at least given us an interview.  The fact of the matter is that Silicon Valley treats us very badly. If we can&#x27;t put our talent and ideas to work &quot;for the man&quot;, why is it so hard for us to put our ideas to work for ourselves?",1389402369

Prior to adding kernel containers to Borg to allow proper resource isolation between the different jobs on a machine, the per-machine utilization was really embarrassingly low.<p>Another point to consider is that not all jobs are shaped the same as the machines - some jobs need more memory (so if you put them on a number of dedicated machines adding up to the total amount of memory needed, there will be lots of wasted CPU), and other jobs use a lot more CPU and less memory (so if you put them on a number of dedicated machines adding up to the total amount of CPU needed, there will be lots of wasted memory).<p>By breaking each job up into a greater number of smaller instances and bin-packing on to each machine, you could take advantage of the different resource shapes of different jobs to get better overall utilization.",1432000759

People flock to something for whatever reason. This builds a community (or network) that entices others to join. That also tend to forget about other things and reinvent the wheel.

Even Facebook went back to that model for mobile IIRC. Good luck convincing most Web technologists to switch to client-server, though.<p>Whoever solves both these problems will create ripple effects that grow innovation at a heightened, maybe exponentially better, pace.

9567751,comment,9566091,9566537,0,0,mikekchar,,,"Looking at their admittedly bad website, I am thinking the following:<p>Let&#x27;s assume that the next big thing is not centralized services, but distributed ones.  We&#x27;ve already gone through periodic waves of P2P mania.  Even Bittorrent got a fair amount of VC.  I think it is not unreasonable to gamble that in the next 10 years distributed systems and protocols will dominate and client/server will fall into disuse.<p>Of course it might not happen, but if it did, where would you need to position yourself in order to be able to profit massively from it?  There are several major problems with P2P applications.  For example, you need coordination, authentication and resistance to bad players.<p>Bitcoin has a reputation for having solved many of these problems for its domain.  Although it might not be the <i>best</i> way to solve all of these problems (specifically proof of work may not be optimal for many problems), imagine that you are trying to sell your idea to a VC company.  Can you come up with a convincing story about how this technology can be used to solve most of these problems?  Even on HN there are a large number of people who think that the Bitcoin implementation of a block chain is the solution to practically every distributed authentication/coordination problem.<p>Now imagine building a chip that would enable the use of this technology in every day equipment.  You could look at it as the modern day equivalent to the FPU or GPU.  It is distributed authentication/coordination hardware acceleration.  As such, if the world <i>does</i> go to a distributed model of communication/computation, it will practically be <i>required</i>.  As the defacto standard, every single device on the planet will need to include your chip.<p>Are they really thinking to mine bitcoins?  There are some potential applications, perhaps.  For example back in the day Microsoft proposed that there be a &quot;postage fee&quot; for email.  This would make it expensive for people to spam freely.  Imagine a &quot;postage fee&quot; for distributed services, like authentication, whatever.  The fee needn&#x27;t be large and the idea is that the device could mine enough BTC to pay for average usage.  Anybody who wanted more would have to pay for it.  But Bitcoin <i>does</i> provide a convenient method for doing these kinds of really micro payments.<p>Note: I think it&#x27;s an absolutely stupid idea that can&#x27;t work due to the nature of service fees once new BTC runs out, but I can well imagine a VC company completely overlooking this detail.<p>In any case, I can totally see the potential for $100 million or so investment.  I think the web page may intentionally have a lot of fluff -- things that are really improbably or impossible but are there because some key stakeholders expect to see it there.  I think the challenge for them is that they are walking into an arena <i>very</i> early where there is a total vacuum of applications that are currently being used.  What they will need to do is not only build the hardware infrastructure but also convince a lot of people to write applications of the infrastructure so that everybody wants it.  Probably this is one of those instances where you are better off being second or third to the market (like, for example, the Apple Newton).",1431999394

9567747,comment,9564036,9566120,0,0,gallamine,,,"I wasn&#x27;t referring to ToF measurement, I was referring to two diodes measuring the difference in phase of a subcarrier intensity modulated signal. Essentially the subcarrier is a intensity modulation of the light. At XX MHz the optical output power will go from 100% to 0% and then back. If two diodes receive the light at the same distance then difference in phase will be zero (i.e. correlating the two signals will have a 0 lag). If the two diodes are separated by a distance, then one diode will receive a greater optical signal and one will receive a smaller optical signal. Correlating the two received signals (or measuring the phase difference) will directly correspond to the difference in distance between the two diodes - this is because the light travels at a fixed speed and the intensity of the signal directly corresponds to the physical distance. Obviously there isn&#x27;t a unique solution since the diodes could be spaced at multiples of the wavelength, but for a fixed area this isn&#x27;t a problem.<p>This only requires knowledge of the subcarrier modulation frequency, as any diode can be picked as the reference and the others matched to it. This isn&#x27;t an ideal way of doing distance measurement because noise will greatly effect the estimate, but it&#x27;s certainly do-able.",1431999249

If you&#x27;re traveling near the speed of light, light from behind you is drastically redshifted from your point of view, which implies that the wavelength is longer from your point of view.

This is not speeding up evolution, evolution encodes meaningful adaptations to an environment over eons, not fashionable &quot;enhancements&quot; to a persons &quot;IQ&quot;(however that happens to be measured) that may change from year to year. There is a holistic reality that is so blindly and eagerly thrown off by dreaming of the wonders of a brave post/transhuman future it makes one wonder at what point the post-posthumanists will circle back around and want to recover their true humanity unsullied by their forebears ham-handed tinkering.

Too many times I&#x27;ve seen code checked in, after going through code review, that just doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m not talking edge cases, it does not function at all.<p>Get rid of the crutch, and force developers to be responsible for their code. Developers should do all the QA on their code.<p>If you must have QA, don&#x27;t waste them on checking if features are I plmented correctly, repeating a job developers should do. Instead, have them actually check quality: have them look at the whole app or site holistically. Have them try to find the bugs that developers won&#x27;t be able to find.",1431997841

Once you&#x27;ve deployed hundreds of servers using the same exact Ubuntu 12.04 LTS kernel base, why not just completely abstract the OS away and focus the attention on scaling the OS services that matter? Why is that when I decide that I need to scale out, I need to copy every library of the OS and every line of code for the kernel and redeploy it every time I add a node?<p>> <i>At this rate we&#x27;ll end up shipping containers as &#x27;apps&#x27; to the clients machines with a suitable emulator at some point.</i><p>That&#x27;s exactly the point.

This is both true in a health cluster but even more true once even small failures or fluctuations occur. You might be able to tune your network and your software to _minimize_ observed partitions but you are very unlikely to see a system free of fluctuations outside of the hard-realtime system construction which none of the above qualify for by a very long shot.<p>It&#x27;s a heavy price, sure, but in return you&#x27;ll be able to round off the tail in most scenarios. This is a trade off that many don&#x27;t properly consider when they try to focus on that mean performance while they miss part of the point of the dynamo model which helps provide better guarantees about how things perform in more cases, including highly tuned clusters with very few major failures.",1431997474

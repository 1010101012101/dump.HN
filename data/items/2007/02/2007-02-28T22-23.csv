I've worked with some great people who didn't have the most masterful command of English. Nitpicking grammar aside, sometimes these shortcomings become effective barriers in a working relationship. Documenting software specs or just conducting regular correspondence with an international team definitely brings these, well, obstacles to light. With WhiteSmoke's software, I can see a lot of rough roads being paved.<p>But then, there's never an application without implication. Just as some have relied on a spell and grammar check to do the dirty work, I have a feeling this software will be used often as a substitute for proper proof-reading.",1172703458

This would help the user accept the new network, as he wouldn't need to again add to his already detached web identity. <p>This extension -- or compliment -- of networks is a potential solution to the problem of fragmented identities spread across the web.",1172702426

They don't need the cash at that point; oftentimes, they're already profitable.  But the VCs have connections to investment banks that can smooth the IPO process.<p>Microsoft is the best example of this.  I think ViaWeb may have done something similar before its acquisition.",1172701643

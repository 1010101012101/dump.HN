The ridership had been decreasing for several years before the purchase of the Red Line.  Long-time residents say predictable things -- autos were more convenient and faster than streetcars.<p>Short of doing your thesis on this, it will be hard to separate the truth from the legend on this story.<p>(Not a public transit hater.)",1347728392

But you need a more sophisticated argument to show that.<p>Similarly, there are only countably many properties of natural numbers that you can write down in any formal language, and this sort of cardinality-counting argument won't let you prove that any of those are uncomputable. Some of them are, but again you need a more complicated argument to prove it.",1347728341

I had to check Wikipedia on decidability:<p><i>There are two distinct senses of the word ""undecidable"" in mathematics and computer science. The first of these is the proof-theoretic sense used in relation to Gdel's theorems, that of a statement being neither provable nor refutable in a specified deductive system. The second sense, which will not be discussed here, is used in relation to computability theory and applies not to statements but to decision problems, which are countably infinite sets of questions each requiring a yes or no answer. Such a problem is said to be undecidable if there is no computable function that correctly answers every question in the problem set.</i><p>I don't believe that you're talking about the first meaning, from formal logic. As for the second meaning, it does not apply either, since your ""problem set"" is not countably infinite.",1347728119
4526550,comment,4526049,4526443,1,0,tikhonj,,,"That's complicated. While a computer cannot, strictly speaking, have an <i>infinite</i> amount of memory (unless my understanding of physics is off-kilter, which is entirely plausible), computers do have an <i>arbitrary</i> amount of memory. Put another way, I don't know how much memory any given computer can access; for any computer you give me, I could imagine a computer with more memory. (Again, physics intercedes, so this is also something of a thought experiment.) So you can think of Turing-completeness as the <i>limit</i> of what a computer can do as you increase its memory.<p>To illustrate this fairly viscerally, a modern computer can access the internet and use an <i>obscene</i> amount of memory which will only go up in the future. We don't know how far up it will go, so modelling it as infinite makes sense.<p>Also, as another thought experiment, what if the universe <i>is</i> infinite? And what if it contains an infinite--or at least quickly expanding--amount of matter? Then a computer <i>could</i> effectively have infinite memory. Unfortunately, I really can't comment because I know even less about physics than I do about math :P.",1347728067
4526549,comment,4525954,4526138,2,0,fafner,,,"I don't think that photovoltaic is an essential step on a grid perspective. The production of PV cells costs a lot of energy, produces a lot of CO2 and requires a lot of nasty chemicals (zB HF). The prices are only cheap because of massive government subsidies and in the EU because of silly laws, that force grid operators to accept every bit of solar energy despite what the plan says.<p>The best way would probably to invest in thorium and other modern nuclear technologies. But that's not desired. Waterpower is limited by nature. Currently the real alternative seems to be wind and depending on where you are solarthermal and geothermal. Especially massive offshore wind/wave plants. But all of this requires a restructuring of the power grid and massive pump-storage plants.<p>And I don't think c2 was considering diesel as a future alternative but just trying to give an idea about the size requirements.",1347728067

The bit I found hilarious in the GP message was not the idea of tailoring RFPs to a single company, but that this company would also get paid for the RFP writing stage. In the private sector it seems to be expected that the vendor has the decency to do at least that part for free :-)<p>(The first time I was involved in writing an RFP for our own product, we kept on cringing as we piled more and more obscure features of the system into it.

A well designed RFP can mitigate this somewhat by requiring menu pricing on add/deducts for the most common in-field changes, but it can't account for everything, and bidding contractors look for open ended RFPs and exploit them.<p>There may only be a few 'shady contractors' out there as you say, but a)low-bid systems bring them to the top of the short list, and b)I'd wager almost every 'reputable' contractor's change order margins are higher than for the exact same work that was competed in a public RFP.<p>Just my thoughts on that. Raised an eyebrow since change orders are the primary mechanism for inflating post-award margins.<p>Edit:<p>Also want to point out that my use of the word 'gouging' is kind of a loaded term:<p><i>>But I think it's worth pointing out that change orders are probably THE primary mechanism of gouging used by contractors in 'lowest-bid-wins' scenarios</i><p>Are these contractors gouging? They are not doing anything illegal, but it can fall into questionably ethical territory. But from many contractor's point of view, they are stuck bidding on a system that is designed somewhat unethically. 
From a systems standpoint, when the only factor in winning a bid is lowest cost on the delivery of a product that will unquestionably have change orders, you get a scenario where the following is actually happening.<p>1)Firms provide goods and service for margin 'a+b' which is averaged over the life of the project<p>2)Only margin 'a' is competed<p>3)Margin 'b' is projected but undefined and can be adjusted by the Firm after the award based on margin 'a'<p>Is it ethical to even ask a Firm to submit a bid based on margin 'a' set equal to  margin 'b' knowing that the system is designed to produce competing bids distributing the total product margin unevenly between the two variables, weighting 'b' much more heavily and minimizing 'a' in order to win the bid and work at all?<p>I don't think so, and what happens is you get a system that is almost explicitly designed to inject increased total project costs and increased variability.<p>I think that under this system, it's an incredibly gray area on the how ethical increased post-award margins on change orders are. Just the fact that an increase occurs does not strike me as unethical, but there is absolutely zero doubt that some of the margin increases are absolutely unethical and drive the total product margin up well past what it would have been if bid under a possibly more efficient system (throw out high and low bids for example).<p>If gouging is going to happen, it's going to happen on a change order, but it's not so black and white.",1347725571

Software patents might have helped Ric Richardson's startup survive and grow, but who's to say they haven't cost other developers the chance to survive? Look at what he's doing to other companies now.<p>2. Is it fair that Richardson's firm should have a monopoly on license checking for 20 years? Just think about that - we're talking about the rights to the broad, basic idea of a license-checking mechanism being allocated to a single person for 20 whole years.

Should the patent have been approved in the first place, when what seems to be prior art existed in the '80s? (Based on the X-Plane dev's research.)

Tightening the standards for issuing patents could conceivably allow developers to launch products and try implementing new features without a particular fear of stepping on patent landmines.

4526360,comment,4526050,4526050,22,0,robomartin,,,"This article is one-sided.  The problem is that it is aimed at the wrong side.<p>Yes, government purchasing and management of projects is a disaster.  I have first hand experience in this realm. As a taxpayer you almost want to cry when you see it happen.  I won't get into the nitty-gritty of the details.  I saw, as an example, a government agency pay DOUBLE what they would have paid for a commodity computer accessory.  They had bids (mine, among others, I am sure) that cut their costs in half.  Yet, they went with the bid that doubled their costs.  Why?  Because those doing the buying were so incompetent and insecure that they wanted one supplier to provide all the components rather than allowing the best suppliers to come in and provide them with competitive pricing.  It was ""cover my ass"" at it's best.<p>Let's not even mention the ridiculous rules that make it nearly impossible for small businesses to participate and expensive for others to do so.<p>To make matters worst, this particular contract was awarded to a foreign supplier.  The funds came from Obama's ""American Reinvestment and Recovery Act"".  Money that was supposed to create jobs in the US went out of the country.  When confronted with this reality they came back saying that the company in question had sales offices in the US and that they had formed a corporation in the US and that this qualified them as a US entity.  Holy crap!<p>I firmly believe that we'd do far better if government wasn't involved in most of this stuff.  I'm not sure how that can happen, but the idea is appealing to me.<p>I said that the article is one-sided because it completely ignores on of the real reasons why these construction projects are so expensive and take so long:  unionized workers.  To put it plainly, their purpose in life is to rape the US taxpayer for as much as they can get and, in the process, provide themselves with as much pay, benefits, vacation and short work days as possible.  And we keep paying for them once they retire in the form of ridiculous lifetime pensions.  The real cost of that tunnel is probably far greater once you take into account having to pay those workers' pensions for life.<p>Examples of ridiculous union behavior abound.  If you've ever had to work with or within a unionized system you've probably experienced the state of disbelief most rational people experience when they realize what's going on.<p>Take, as an example, doing a trade-show in NYC.  I have dozens of examples of union bullshit, but I'll just mention one.  We did a show where we needed to have a light turned off above our booth.  That's it.  The request was that simple:  Please turn off the light above our booth.  Of course, a union electrician had to do this.  The fee?  $368.  Three hundred and sixty eight dollars for the guy to go over to the breaker panel and flip a switch.<p>OK, here's another.  You are not allowed to plug in your devices into the electrical system.  You know, what you do at home and at the office all the time.  Nope, a union electrician has the necessary expertise to install an extension cord and plug in your computer into the AC outlet.  I forget what the fee was for that, but it was ridiculous.<p>Our solution?  We did all of our booth setup work at night.  The union workers in the night shift are lazier than shit.  They don't want to work.  So, they let you do almost whatever you want as long as you let them sleep on the job.  Sometimes you'd have to slip someone a hundred dollar bill to be left alone.  Far better than dealing with their bullshit.<p>I have not had to work with unionized construction crews.  I can only imagine how much worst the whole thing must be.<p>The best thing that could happen to this country is if unions were outlawed.  Of course, that will never happen.  I'd sure be nice though.  Imagine, people actually having to work for a living.  And, produce, behave, be responsible, be capable, compete, etc.  What a concept.<p>Dont' get me started about the planned California high-speed rail. It's a $68 billion money grab designed to feed unions and keep politicians who favor them in power.  The money will never be recovered.  The line makes no sense whatsoever.  Sick.",1347724990

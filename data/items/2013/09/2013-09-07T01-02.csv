The particulars of your agreement with a third-party for storage of your email does <i>not</i> extend government rights to examine that data (the ads in your inbox are as non-public as the email in there too). Even the horribly flawed ECPA recognizes that (it buttresses it, in fact). Moreover, Google[1] is currently standing behind the US v Warshak shield and requiring warrants for email contents.<p>The problems with the third-party doctrine are much more fundamental than the ways in which that third-party is storing and displaying your data, activities that continue for any webmail client even in the absence of ads when doing spam filtering, searching, etc. Merely the fact that a third-party is involved at all is enough for the outdated sections of the ECPA to rear their ugly heads. Here&#x27;s hoping the Supreme Court takes up a case like US v Warshak soon.<p>[1] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/01/google-stands-up-for-gmail-users-requires-cops-to-get-a-warrant/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/01/google-stands-up-...</a>",1378519125

Against a nation-state, the TOR network has insufficient resources and has sufficient bad actors that it is not actually secure.

6343627,comment,6341570,6342490,3,0,205guy,,,"I agree with the sentiment of the passage you quote (and the original article in general), but I actually think historical circumstances are a bit different than &quot;Americans have fought and suffered and died to preserve freedom over our history.&quot;<p>Yes, Americans have fought and suffered and died to preserve some nebulous definition of freedom, but not the Americans you think--nor the freedoms you think. I&#x27;m not sure how the original author meant the statement, but usually, statements like that refer to American soldiors who fought in wars that are assumed to have preserved US freedom. But not since 1812 have the US armed forces needed to defend the territory where the freedoms enshrined in its constitution are in effect. For the US civil war, there was no black nor white (to make a bad pun) on the Union side, so I&#x27;ll call that a wash on preserving freedoms. Yes, during the world wars, the US projected its power and helped to reinstate freedoms in Europe (almost exclusively), but we&#x27;re not talking about the defense of Europe here.<p>One could argue that by using and projecting military power and becoming the sole remaining world superpower, the US has preserved US freedoms by pushing our &quot;borders&quot; further away and engaging the &quot;enemies&quot; of said freedoms before they reach us/US (which is why 9/11 was such a shock, similar to the Vandals sacking Rome). I think that&#x27;s a stretch, given that much of our recent military action seems directly aimed at preserving access to petroleum energy, not actually preserving freedoms.<p>Taking the Howard Zinn approach to US history, there have always been US citizens who are denied their freedoms within the US. From native Americans in the 19th century, to labor movements in the early 20th century, targets of McCarthy, civil rights activists, to occupiers of the 21st century. Many of these did suffer and die because they dared to oppose the political and economic status quo, and relied on their freedoms of speech and assembly to do so.<p>And to be frank, they preserved nothing. The freedoms were always trampled whenever it suited the powers-that-be. In other words, exactly what&#x27;s happening now.<p>I think now <i>feels</i> different because the internet gave us a taste of true freedoms. Freedom to publish your speech to the world at almost zero cost. Freedom to find and network with like-minded people. Freedom to have political influence just by writing a blog. Freedom to enact change lawfully and peacefully by rallying against WallSt corruption, revealing the extent of the Military-Industrial Complex, questioning the wars, questioning the powers-that-be.<p>It turns out, we never really had those freedoms on the internet. Edit to add one of my favorite pithy sayings: same as it ever was.",1378518860

And it&#x27;s evolving quickly in all the right ways.<p>But it isn&#x27;t really like Ruby with static typing. The language isn&#x27;t Rubyish (no mixins or blocks, for example). It makes you put everything in a class, a la Java. It can verbose and is occasionally downright clunky (though syntactically it&#x27;s categorically slicker than Java). The .NET ecosystem doesn&#x27;t have the Ruby characteristic of lots of small, fast-evolving libraries that are easy to use. In fact, the C# open source ecosystem is kinda poor in general and not a huge part of most developer&#x27;s lives, whereas Ruby&#x27;s ecosystem is vibrant and an integral part of its coding culture.<p>Another way to put all that is that if C# were purely dynamically typed, it wouldn&#x27;t feel anything like Ruby.<p>I do see what you&#x27;re saying: LINQ feels like a static (and lazy!) version of Ruby&#x27;s Enumerable module, the lambdas look similar, C# actually does have optional dynamic typing, and C# is increasingly full of nice developer-friendly features.

I suspect that if we tried to clearly define that word we would find many more actions that many people would argue should be disallowed, like the &quot;initiation of physical force&quot;. But many of those things would be far more controversial. My point is that real, existing (non-theoretical) markets are more complex than you seem to believe. Market actors will always try to find the &quot;edges&quot; of acceptable behaviour in order to gain advantage, and in a dynamic, changing world, those edges continuously multiply, making self-regulation in real life a pretty unreasonable prospect in my opinion.",1378516096

In my personal experience, such tasks will be given to employees who are likely to perform them.<p>For example, at a past sysadmin job, I was asked about the technical feasibility of monitoring a certain employees computer use, whom management suspected of some minor infringement. I refused to assist in the matter on moral grounds and was reprimanded. The task was given to a colleague of mine who had no qualms about it. Next time, they went straight to him.<p>And the more complex, distributed and large a system is, the more people are in positions where they can compromise it. It takes only one person to break the whole system (which is basically what just happened to the NSA). Do you trust everyone who has or can gain access to your SSL private key? Everyone who manages your network?",1378516063

6343528,comment,6343308,6343308,13,0,ariwilson,,,"Just to clarify the discussion here, since the NSA is involved in snooping on internet users along many different dimensions, I think what is being discussed here is encrypting internal Google data being transmitted from datacenter to datacenter via private fiber optic cables. Recent revelations seem to indicate the NSA has set up fiber taps on various company&#x27;s networks. This encryption would frustrate those tapping efforts.<p>Legal requests to Google for user data are not affected by this change. Neither is private data at rest, which is still presumably encrypted. Neither are other extralegal avenues the NSA has to infiltrate Google (employee co-operation or intimidation, exploiting zero days to get into corporate networks, hijacking security protocol construction, etc).",1378515898

He had it in mind that there was a ""socially necessary abstract labor-time"" of every action - which take a very limited view based on a very limited period in history. Take for instance, Louis Pasteur, who invented pasteurization. How much socially necessary abstract labor-time was that worth? Ten million units of necessary abstract labor-time? How much was creating GMail worth? How much abstract labor time is Picasso's best work worth, compared to Matisse?<p>Publius Syrius said back in Roman times, ""Everything is worth what its purchaser will pay for it."" - and so far, that's the only model we've found that does a decent job of handling contributions without going to totalitarianism.

If you think OCaml's ""easy genericness"" is ""more flexible than C++ templates"" then provide an example of the exercise of such flexibility.<p>Second, ease of translation between languages is not particularly relevant to flexibility.  Insofar as it <i>is</i> relevant, things that are more flexible are typically more difficult, not easier, on account of that flexibility, at least in my experience.<p>Remember, your original claim was not about <i>ease</i>, but about <i>flexibility</i>.  I doubt you attempted the subtle transition maliciously, and perhaps your original claim was where you misspoke, but I would never argue that C++ templates are <i>easier</i> than other forms of genericity, simply that they're <i>more flexible</i>.",1260979934

Going to war with someone who doesn't want it and apologized is a bad play, but they should at least see if they can get a little further with this.

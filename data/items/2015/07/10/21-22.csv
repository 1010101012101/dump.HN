If transfer payments were made to taper up from max(wealth) (receives $0) to min(wealth) (receives $average(wealth)), disparity would be brought to 0, which would naturally lead to everybody doing what they wanted rather than what earned them income.

Privacy creates liability.  Visibility creates value.<p>The problem we have right now is the idea that one entity should have domain over any information.  That&#x27;s what we need to get over.  It should be shared- <i>all</i> of it, from bank security cameras down to what you&#x27;re doing in the shower.  When all surveillance is shared, you find that people suddenly get a lot more tolerant, because throwing stones in glass houses isn&#x27;t helpful.<p>The Earth is a closed system.  We have finite, shared resources.  Privacy creates the fiction that it&#x27;s not a closed system.  You think that&#x27;s how the space station works?  Is that how you want it to work?  No, you want cameras on <i>everything</i>, because if someone decides to experiment with the CO2 scrubbers, it affects everyone.<p>The same is true here on Earth.  We&#x27;re now in an age where one person or company or government can single-handedly change the habitability of the entire planet, such as Exxon did in the 80s.  That&#x27;s dangerous.<p>And meanwhile, there&#x27;s incredibly valuable, life-saving services and conveniences we can all enjoy if we are open with all our surveillance data.  How many lives could be saved or improved if we all had a smartwatch measuring our vitals and our food intake and toilet waste were monitored?  That one change could single-handedly resolve most of our healthcare issues in the US.<p>What we really need instead of privacy is complete visibility coupled with a code of conduct that emulates the benefits we expect from privacy.  Just because we <i>can</i> see everything doesn&#x27;t mean we have a right to bother people with what we know.  That&#x27;s the issue we need to address.  By all means, check out whomever in the shower, but that doesn&#x27;t give you a right to interfere with that person&#x27;s life by commenting on their genitalia.  That&#x27;s the key ingredient we&#x27;re missing from the privacy conversation.  We like privacy because we equate it with civility and thus freedom.<p>If someone doesn&#x27;t know something, then they can&#x27;t make you miserable with it.  But that doesn&#x27;t really work anymore.  Even if someone doesn&#x27;t know something, big data techniques can interpolate what it is they&#x27;re not supposed to know.  What you&#x27;re really signing up for with &quot;privacy&quot; is granting visibility to only a privileged few- the spy agencies, the multinational companies, the hackers, and anyone willing to pay for the information.",1436564917

In the space of 10 years, my home fridge failed once, ran for a few more years, and then just stopped cooling. Over that time period, I&#x27;ve repaired nearly every appliance in the house. They were all new when we moved in, because we bought a house that was empty of appliances.<p>Dehumidifier: Defective potentiometer. Repaired, then it ultimately wore out and stopped cooling. Folklore is that the seals in the compressors are short lived, system loses the ability to compress the refrigerant sufficiently. This also causes a gradually rising power consumption until it can no longer hold temperature.<p>Chest freezer: Starting relay / capacitor failed. Replaced with unit bought online. Currently idle, as we have nothing to freeze.<p>Microwave: Failed, tried to repair, to no avail.<p>Cooking range: Loose connection in heating element caused wiring to burn up. Repaired by silver-brazing new wire to Nichrome element material.<p>Dryer: Repaired twice. First time was an over-temperature sensor.

Every person named in that section should be brought before a court of law, to determine the truth or falsehood of the accusations in this report. The US criminal justice system has taken a lot of blows to its credibility recently; this is a chance to demonstrate that it still does what it&#x27;s supposed to... or that it doesn&#x27;t.<p>> The APA official who led this behind-the-scenes coordination with the DoD officials was the Ethics Director, Stephen Behnke, and the key DoD official he partnered with was Morgan Banks, the chief of psychological operations for the U.S. Army Special Operations Command and the head of the Army SERE Training program at Ft. Bragg. During the task force’s premeeting communications, during its three-day meetings, and in preparing the task force report, Behnke and Banks closely collaborated to emphasize points that followed then-existing DoD guidance (which used high-level concepts and did not prohibit techniques such as stress positions and sleep deprivation), to suppress contrary points, and to keep the task force’s ethical statements at a very general level in order to avoid creating additional constraints on DoD. They were aided in that regard by the other DoD members of the task force (who, for the most part, also did not want ethical guidance that was more restrictive than existing DoD guidance), and by high-level APA officials who participated in the meeting.<p>> Other leading APA officials intimately involved in the coordinated effort to align APA actions with DoD preferences at the time of PENS were then-APA President Ron Levant, then APA President-Elect Gerald Koocher, and then-APA Practice Directorate chief Russ Newman. Then-APA Board member Barry Anton participated in the selection of the task force members  along with Levant, Koocher, and Behnke and in the task force meeting, but was involved substantially less than the others. Other members of the APA executive management group—namely, CEO Norman Anderson, Deputy CEO Michael Honaker, General Counsel Nathalie Gilfoyle, and communications director Rhea Farberman were involved in relevant communications, as described below.<p>> The other DoD official who was significantly involved in the confidential coordination effort was Debra Dunivin, the lead psychologist supporting interrogation operations at Guantanamo Bay at the time who worked closely with Banks on the issue of psychologist involvement in interrogations. At times, they were coordinating their activities with the Army Surgeon General’s Office. There is evidence that Banks was consulting with other military leaders, likely in the Army Special Operations Command and the Joint Task Force – Guantanamo, although this was not the focus of our investigation, in part because of our limited ability to access DoD documents and personnel. Another important DoD official involved in some coordination with Behnke was PENS task force member Scott Shumate, a former CIA official who was head of behavioral sciences for a newly-created counter intelligence unit (CIFA) within DoD, which reported to the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence.<p>> For Banks, Dunivin, and others at DoD, the attention on the abusive treatment of detainees as a result of the media disclosures of Abu Ghraib, the torture memos, the DoD working group report, and other related events created uncertainty and worry about whether the involvement of psychologists in interrogations would be deemed unethical. Some in DoD, such as civilians Shumate and Kirk Kennedy at CIFA, were pushing APA to move forward with action that would show support for national security psychologists and help end the uncertainty by declaring that psychologists’ participation in interrogations (with some then-undefined limits) was ethical. Others, like military officers Banks and Dunivin, reacted to APA’s movement toward the creation of the task force with concern that APA could head in a negative direction if the task force was not properly set up and controlled, and with awareness that this was an opportunity for DoD.<p>Stephen Behnke.

Everything was great until the pub decided to try to make more money by forcing patrons to sit a certain way. Everyone in town decided to boycott this pub, and then they found another pub (Reddit), that didn&#x27;t have the silly monetization scheme that the Digg pub had. The influx of new patrons turned this quiet little pub in the corner of the town into the main pub in town. Everyone was welcome in this pub - sports types, gamers, geeks, fitness nerds. Everyone had their own little corner, and for a few years the pub provided the town with a place to meet up with people of similar interest, even if the interests were darker in nature.<p>During the last year, the pub decided to hire a new manager (Ellen Pao). The new manager wants the pub to be a more welcoming place for people of all types so she decides to ban a group of rowdy patrons. However, other patrons felt that Ellen Pao intruded on their freedom to express themselves and their own opinions in the pub, and an uprising took place. To calm the uprising, Pao decides to completely silence people who talked shit about her (shadowbans, subreddit bans), and bans out even more groups of people. Patrons were NOT happy about this situation.<p>Then, the managers of this pub decided to fire a very well loved employee who contributed a lot to bringing awesome guests to the pub, without letting the patrons or the other employees know about it. This made other employees of the pub very angry, as they all loved what she does for the community. To make matters worse, the managers make snide comments about the situation. Due to the previous Ellen Pao bannings and the recent firing, everyone in the pub decides to riot in whatever way they can. They also consider moving to a new pub in town (voat.co) though the pub seems to always be full.<p>People were angry, and they knew they have the power to completely render Reddit unpopular, just like they did with Digg.

9866905,comment,9866755,9866812,0,0,mmanfrin,,,"Whole situation started when reddit closed a few hateful subreddits (r/fatpeoplehate, and a few racist ones as well); a very vocal backlash came from the contingent of reddit that believes the admins have no right to &#x27;regulate free speech&#x27;. The site was brigaded and flooded with anti-Pao posts (who they saw as their villain) which then turned to racist &#x27;Chairman Pao&#x27; posts, posts with her and a nazi flag, etc.<p>After a while this calmed down.<p>A week ago reddit fired/let go Victoria, who was the liaison for hundreds of celebrities and reddit, often transcribing entire IAmAs (community interviews). Victoria&#x27;s departure was immediate and caused a lot of planned IAmAs to be postponed or canceled, since she was the go-between (and in some cases the only point of contact).<p>A few major moderators were angry and posted about their displeasure at Victoria&#x27;s departure and the general lack of interface admins have with moderators. This snowballed in to a &#x27;blackout&#x27; of many major subreddits for about a day (longer for a few of the smaller ones). One of the admins posted a &#x27;Popcorn tastes good...&#x27; comment when people asked him what he thought of the anger; which fanned the flames. The major protests died down after about a day or two, but a few subreddits spawned for the specific purpose of continuing the protest and to oust Pao. These people brigaded most posts about Pao and promoted the petition link calling for her removal. The anti-Pao rhetoric continued at full force (with the usual racist &#x27;Chairman Pao&#x27; meme, nazi flags, posts of her photo to a subreddit called &#x27;punchablefaces&#x27;).<p>In summary: Pao and admins were wrong to not communicated with the moderators more, especially when it came to Victoria; the original protest had legitimate legs but then devolved in to the same 4chan-esque bile that happens any time reddit makes some sort of administrative move. That awful bile of protest is what kept the flames going which led to Pao stepping down.",1436564401

In their interview they state that:<p>&quot;Our CDN is a huge part of the jQuery ecosystem. We usually average around 15,000 hits per second to our CDN with 99.8% of those being cache hits. This provides much better performance for those using our CDN as their visitors can use a cached copy of jQuery and not have to download it, thus decreasing load time.&quot;<p>Somehow because of that I assumed that they had analysis done to understand browser caching rates. My bad.<p>EDIT: Huh, funny thing.

If you think\nabout the paper in terms of how a major search engine like Google works,\nand you remember the occasional &quot;index updates&quot; they used to do a few\ntimes a year, you&#x27;ll see the &quot;saturation&quot; or &quot;closure&quot; approach\nmentioned in the paper. i.e.<p>> <i>&quot;compile the knowledge into data, as follows. Infer all\npossible facts derived from the base data and by the semantic\nconstraints prior to querying the database; add these facts to\nthe database; then, process queries on the (enriched) database\nignoring the constraints which have lead to it.&quot;</i><p>Since Google no longer does occasional &quot;index updates&quot; and now updates\ncontinuously, it seems they may have moved to something similar to the\nalternate &quot;reformulation&quot; approach mentioned in the paper:<p>> <i>&quot;The alternative technique is called reformulation. Here,\nthe database is left unchanged, while queries are modified\n(reformulated) to take into account all the known semantic\nconstraints.&quot;</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://pages.saclay.inria.fr/ioana.manolescu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pages.saclay.inria.fr/ioana.manolescu/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFS</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDF_query_language"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDF_query_language</a>",1436563368

Genomics made it possible to acquire nucleic acid sequence and structural information from a wide range of genomes at an unprecedented pace and made this information accessible to further analysis and experimentation. For example, sequences were matched to those coding for globular proteins of known structure (defined by crystallography) and were used in high-throughput combinatorial approaches (such as DNA microarrays) to study patterns of gene expression. Inferences from  equences and biochemical data were used to construct metabolic networks. These activities have generated terabytes of data that are now being analyzed with computer, statistical, and machine learning techniques. The sheer number of sequences and information derived from these endeavors has given the false impression that imagination and hypothesis do not play a role in acquisition of  iological knowledge. However, bioinformatics becomes only a science when fueled by hypothesis-driven research and within the context of the complex and everchanging living world. &quot;",1436563291

It requires you to at the very least read those philosophical/theological concepts instead of dismissing it as &quot;woo&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve read them. They are, from a scientific point-of-view, all woo. Almost by definition. They necessarily appeal -- if they can be epistemologically justified at all -- to a non-utilitarian epistemology. Science is based on a radically utilitarian epistemology: claims are justified to the extent that they are demonstrably useful in explaining and predicting observed phenomena. Theories -- in the non-scientific sense, obviously -- that involve entities that produce results in the physical universe but which are not governed by physical law or controlled by physical events as they are conjectured to be outside of the physical universe -- are non-utilitarian. They are irrelevant to any predictive model of observed behavior, and it is impossible to distinguish by observation between the existence of such non-physical, uncaused causes and processes that are purely physical. Either (a) there exists an adequate scientific model of the process, in which case the model being an accurate model of an underlying physical process is indistinguishable from the uncaused cause merely mimicking the behavior of the model at the times it has been observed, or (b) there exists no adequate scientific model, in which case the physical process not yet being discovered is indistinguishable from a non-physical cause.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that such conjectures cannot be <i>true</i>, just that they can never be validated or distinguished from either <i>known</i> or <i>unknown</i> physical processes.<p>Say we create a machine that behaves like a human to all outward measures. There is no way to distinguish between:<p>(1) Human and machine alike being purely physical,<p>(2) Humans having metaphysical features like a &quot;soul&quot; and internal awareness and machine simply mimicking behavior,<p>(3) Humans and machines alike having metaphysical features like a &quot;soul&quot; (perhaps because God chose to reward human ingenuity by creating a &quot;soul&quot; for the machine.)",1436563279

The ability to run Lua scripts from within is great.<p>Story time: Some time ago we developed a CMS for a large art/production company. One of the requirements was that everything must be access controlled including all assets (eg. images, videos). The site went live and all was good until one day when, for no apparent reason, our monitoring alreted extreme load and then the site went down. Not so good for a company that sells its tickets online... I got on the phone with them and turns out that they started using the CMS to store images used for newsletters, which they sent out to some 200K people that morning. Now normally this wouldn&#x27;t be such a big problem, but since all images were ACLd, this meant that instead of serving static files all requests went to the backend and pretty much killed it. The solution we came up with was to move the initial access control check for assets directly to OpenResty using Lua and Drizzle. So whenever a request came in for an image Openresty checked if it&#x27;s public and only if it was not did the request hit the backend, otherwise it was served directly. Once we pushed this live the load disappeared and never came back.<p>Also I wrote an init script for it (as we needed one for a DRBD setup). Maybe someone will find it useful, here it is:\n<a href=""https://gist.github.com/pwm/d3260804b4ade0d81f29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/pwm/d3260804b4ade0d81f29</a>",1436562659

For example, using media queries, different resolutions, zoom, and print.<p>Not sure why you&#x27;d make such an absolute claim. When you say single version are you saying single html element or single CSS definition? If the former then I disagree (headers, footers, main containers of content, etc), if the latter then I don&#x27;t understand how this would be the case. In HTML IDs are limited to one specific element but you can refer to it as many ways as you want in CSS which means you can use different media questions, handle resolutions, print, etc.<p>So I&#x27;m not really sure I understand your point.<p>> Being less specific allows your css to be more manageable to change in many different situations. In complicated layouts, cascades are very non-friendly.<p>I&#x27;ve worked in a lot of really large projects and I&#x27;m not sure how little to no specificity could be more manageable due to side-effects. Ultimately you&#x27;re going to need a mixture of specific and non-specific styling so arguing whether you should be more or less doesn&#x27;t really make sense to me; just use the right level of specificity for the job at hand. If you have a page with specialized content you might want to be more specific there to not mess up another page. If you have a lot of re-usable components you probably want less.",1436562658

That hasn&#x27;t been even close to true for many years.<p>For example, I work with some very high-end PC workstations (think multimedia, 3D modelling, that kind of thing). Sure, the new spec ones are a bit faster, but if you look back those 4 years you mentioned, there really isn&#x27;t that much difference.<p>The price/performance sweet spot back then was probably an i7 2600K. Are modern CPUs faster? Sure. Are they an order of magnitude faster? Not even close. The main emphasis in recent years has been on lower power/heat and to some extent on increasing core count particularly at the high end. Actual per-core speeds or instruction processing has improved only modestly. <i>And in most applications, they were already so powerful that you wouldn&#x27;t even notice the difference.</i><p>Graphics cards are a similar story. Of course modern cards are somewhat faster than their counterparts from a generation ago, but unless you use the most demanding software, the card in that i7 2600K machine probably still works just fine with today&#x27;s applications. <i>Again, most people wouldn&#x27;t even notice the difference, because the baseline level was already high enough.</i><p>The amount of RAM typically supplied in modern PCs hasn&#x27;t much changed, so no huge jumps in capability there either. In fact, I&#x27;d say storage and networking are probably the only major areas where speeds are dramatically better today than they were four years ago in most western economies. This is largely because it has become cost-effective at mainstream levels to use things like SSDs, fibre broadband and 4G mobile networks where the previous generation of devices at a similar price point would have used spinning platters, old phone lines and 3G. These changes really do render the previous generation of devices obsolete at a similar price point and really do make a substantial difference to what an average user can do with the new equipment.<p>The only other area where there have been dramatic improvements, not in performance but in capability, are displays. The 200+ ppi devices previously reserved for high-end and physically small mobile devices are now widely available in laptops. Your new 48&quot; TV might show 4K material natively. But again, this only helps if you have content to look at that can take advantage of the finer details, which a lot of people won&#x27;t, so I&#x27;d hardly say it makes a good display from the previous generation obsolete.",1436562322

But he is not talking about the browser cache. He can&#x27;t be, because jQuery, or MaxCDN for that matter has no idea what the &quot;hit rate&quot; of a browser cache is.<p>Example: If I go to <i>1.example.com</i>, which links to <i>maxcdn.com/jquery.js</i>, and then later I go to site <i>2.example.com</i>, which links to the same <i>maxcdn.com/jquery.js</i> file, my browser doesn&#x27;t send any requests! That is the entire point of far-future caching! I was able to use the version of jquery that was in my browser cache. However MaxCDN, or jQuery for that matter, have no idea this hit took place.<p>By the same token, if I go to <i>1.example.com</i>, which links to <i>maxcdn.com/jquery.js</i>, and then later I go to site <i>2.example.com</i>, which links to a different URL like <i>maxcdn.com/master/jquery.js</i>, my browser has a cache miss. /master/jquery.js is not in my browser&#x27;s cache, I&#x27;ve never been there. MaxCDN, or jQuery for that matter, have no idea that I requested something different then before.<p>CDN cache hit rate has nothing to do with browser caches. In fact, people that are not you, being able to detect if something is in your browser cache or not, is a massive security problem. See my talk at BlackHat in 2007, Many of Jeremiah Grossman&#x27;s talks at BlackHat (2006, 2007, 2009), or go all the way back to Ed Felton&#x27;s work on using the timing side channels against browser caches.<p>In the industry, &quot;99.8%&quot; cache hit on a CDN&#x27;s edge server means that 99.8% of the time the edge server can handle the request, instead of the request having to go all the way to the origin. They have no way of knowing how often a random person on the internet loads a random file from their browser cache.<p>This whole thing proves my point: Calling shared, common, publicly hosted copies of popular JS libraries &quot;CDN&#x27;s&quot; or &quot;JavaScript CDNs&quot; is just confuses people. CDNs are about reducing latency. Share JS libraries are about trying to avoid requests altogether by leveraging the browser cache, and they are largely ineffective.",1436562295

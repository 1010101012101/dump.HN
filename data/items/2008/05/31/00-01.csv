I have a hobby that is also practiced professionally by a lot of businesses and I have been thinking recently of building a software package for the smaller providers since I have a lot of insight into what they need. Because it's also my hobby, I'd be eating my own dogfood and can see what works & what doesn't.",1212195596

They support hosting multiple sites on one account, PHP, Rails, and Django while having extremely fast and helpful customer service. The latency is good, although not blazing, and I've had perfect uptime so far since I signed up six months ago. My plan is $9.50/month and allows shell access (the clincher for me), 80 MB RAM, 10 GB HD, and 600 GB bandwidth. I definitely recommend them.<p><a href=""http://www.webfaction.com/?affiliate=pillarofeden"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webfaction.com/?affiliate=pillarofeden</a><p>* Disclaimer - this is an affiliate link.",1212193641

Its all mostly pretend now anyway. Patents really have about as much to do with ideas as Scientology has to do with science.<p>It also seems these days that the more a company blathers about patent-pending this and proprietary that, the less actual innovation they've done.",1212193636

204976,comment,204363,204363,0,0,DougBTX,,,"The article hinges strongly on this quote, which strikes me as wrong:<p><i>Windows 7 will ship in 2009, almost certainly in time for holiday PCs. Microsoft disclosed today that there would be no major architectural changes from Vista, which would greatly reduce development complications.</i><p>The author probably heard ""Vista applications will be able to run on their original architecture"" and reported it as ""Windows 7 will have the same architecture as Vista.""<p>Noises coming from Microsoft suggest Windows 7 will support ""legacy"" applications using virtualization so that they can run in their native environments, specifically to set Windows 7 free to do things without the strain of backwards compatibility. Much like Apple when it released OS X.<p>One thing to remember though, Windows 7 is just vapourware and a couple of videos so far.",1212193404

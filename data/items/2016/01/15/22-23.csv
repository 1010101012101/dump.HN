I&#x27;ve seen this myself: you don&#x27;t have to grow up rich or even upper middle class to get rich as a startup founder, but few successful founders grew up desperately poor.

There is an enormous difference in wealth between the household Larry Page grew up in and that of a successful startup founder, but that didn&#x27;t prevent him from joining their ranks. It&#x27;s not economic inequality per se that&#x27;s blocking social mobility, but some specific combination of things that go wrong when kids grow up sufficiently poor.</i><p>Someone paid a small fortune to buy Larry Page the same elite credentials that billionaires buy for their children, and it was the critical component in his success.<p>Others spent fortunes buying the same elite credentials for Bill Gates, Paul Graham, Mark Zuckerberg, Drew Houston, Sam Altman, Peter Thiel, and most other &quot;successful&quot; Silicon Valley founders/investors.<p>All of these people are smart but that&#x27;s not why they&#x27;re rich.

But chat in general was the community thing, along with a few of the door games. Like my old TW2002 opponent, we&#x27;re still in touch. My little bro went to a couple of those GTs. In retrospect, if I had kids, I wouldn&#x27;t want them involved in that, because some of those BBS people were questionably creepy.<p>In one way, Internet chats haven&#x27;t caught on to what we had in 1989, which was seeing every keystroke from everyone simultaneously in separate panels. Line by line (IRC style) is less personal by comparison. Watching the keystrokes and edits unfold, it&#x27;s more compelling, and MajorBBS deserves credit for that unique multiuser experience which required specialized hardware. Multitasking > 2 phone lines was rare because fast PCs could barely multitask 2 modems with DESQView or OS/2.  Windows did not have any multitasking capability yet. And only OS/2 had any concept of prioritizing the CPU. So most BBS doors were limited to &quot;turn based&quot; games where you play after somebody else (your turn, like RISK) unless you had MajorBBS which had low-latency fast action battlefields like Flash Attack. What you now call AJAX (single page apps) we could do that in the 80s with ANSI position codes, which you&#x27;re just starting to see today on Facebook, where you can see content updating without a page refresh. We were severely limited to an 80x23 grid with only 16 foreground colors, but we made it amazing.",1452898412

But the W3C just couldn&#x27;t keep up, and for now the browser developers seem to be mostly ignoring it as a result.<p>Per above, the quality of specifications is far greater than it was a decade ago, and it is (despite the perception of many) still the case that specifications are most of the time always nearly-complete before anyone ships anything (typically the incomplete parts are the bizarre edge-cases that no web developer is likely to ever run into, but there is a real attempt to avoid undefined behaviour), and there&#x27;s definitely more involvement across the various standards orgs from <i>all</i> browser developers than there was a decade ago, W3C included.<p>The increasing number of browser &quot;idiosyncrasies&quot; is mostly a result of ever-increasing complexities in implementations (partly down to the increasing complexity and size of the web platform, partly down to new features being retrofitted into implementations that weren&#x27;t originally designed to do anything like the new feature, and partly down to lack of a good shared, between all vendors, testsuite for CSS).<p>I am remain hopeful that we&#x27;re moving towards somewhere better when it comes to interoperability across browsers. web-platform-tests (<a href=""https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests</a>) has got us a good, high-quality test suite for the platform minus CSS, and is run by most but not yet all browsers on a daily basis (and I think it&#x27;s realistic to hope that by the end of 2016 it&#x27;ll be run by all browsers on a daily basis, and that for many it will be <i>the</i> place they write tests, hence test suites will basically become shared rather than done separately with different coverage holes for bugs to slip through). csswg-test (<a href=""https://github.com/w3c/csswg-test"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/w3c/csswg-test</a>) is slowly starting to move towards a point where it&#x27;ll be as widely run as web-platform-tests (please don&#x27;t make me think about this too much, I&#x27;m finally making progress there, making the same arguments as five years ago but now with the evidence from web-platform-tests that it actually works).<p>And finally:<p>> I can&#x27;t remember the last time I read anything on the W3C site. I do find myself there now and then, but sadly, it is simply irrelevant to most of my daily web development work. What matters in a world with ever-moving goalposts is what browsers can actually do right now, which today basically means which of the evergreen browsers have support currently, which of their LTS releases also have support, and what the situation with IE and possibly older mobile browsers is, as validated by actual testing in each case.<p>Really that makes it sound like half the problem is the fact that the spec documents give no informative data about what browsers support what features. There&#x27;s definitely been talk about trying to do something better here, but it&#x27;s a hard problem: you need some way to gauge support <i>and</i> quality of implementation, across all browsers and across all features. I think there&#x27;s mostly agreement that caniuse is actually too coarse to really be put anywhere near a spec (because specs are rarely implemented as atomic units—there&#x27;s normally different statuses for different sections), and that just grabbing test suite results isn&#x27;t that useful either (because you can fail large numbers of tests due to obscure bugs, or because you&#x27;ve only implemented the awkward 20% not the easy 80%, so you&#x27;re actually closer to shipping complete support than someone who supports the easy 80%).<p>(As a disclaimer: I&#x27;ve been around the W3C and WHATWG for quite a while (coming up to a decade), have been employed/contracted for several browser vendors, and was one of the early pushers to get high-quality test suites shared across all browsers.)",1452898268

Without innovative uber rich people we wouldn&#x27;t see companies like Tesla or SpaceX or programs like YC.<p>Assuming that rent-seeking is root cause of rising (bad) inequality What is the best way to solve that?<p>IMO more rules and regulations would exasperate the problem as it will create more complexity and loopholes to exploit.<p>In practice, the more regulations that exist the higher the barrier to entry is for potentially disruptive startups. The problems Uber has faced is a good example of this.<p>It doesn&#x27;t have to be this way though, it&#x27;s feasible for there to be regulation that discourages anticompetitive behaviour.

But we live in a finite world, this total inequality is impossible. Furthermore, whether we introduce an infinite inequality or a finite inequality, there&#x27;s no reason the lower bound should be at 0 (where people starve and die). Suppose we have a society whose inequality range generally falls within 1 and 1,000,000. 1 is a sustenance standard of living, any unfortunate event could totally wipe you out, but it&#x27;s pretty much maintainable with little effort provided that unfortunate event doesn&#x27;t happen. Somewhere around 3 being the poverty line and somewhere around 8 being a decent standard of living so long as you&#x27;re working to maintain it, and somewhere around 50-100 is enough for most people to effectively have that same decent standard of living as 8 but without having to maintain it so hard e.g. through a job. What&#x27;s wrong with this lower bound increasing by 1 every year (with its associated low level of upkeep remaining the same) while the upper bound increases by 2 every year? The inequality is growing with each year, but in 2 years there is no one below the poverty line, and in 7 years everyone has a decent standard of living but they don&#x27;t really have to put in effort for it.

You gave an incomplete answer and now imply that I should be doing your homework for you.<p>You wrote:<p>> if you study the Kosovo War outbreak there were situations where regions were cut off from supplies, power was lost, but yet there was no invasion or shelling. Ireland comes to mind, there are some examples..<p>In case I was wrong, and missing something well-known, I reviewed the Kosovo War summary at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo_War"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo_War</a> and The Troubles at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles</a> . I cannot find a relevant example.<p>For Kosovo, the closest I could find was the Izbica massacre, where FRY and Republic of Serbia forces stole from several thousand villagers then killed 130 Kosovo Albanian men, and the Battle of Junik, where Junik was under siege for 20 days. However, both actions were carried out by partisans, and don&#x27;t show sign of a third party filling a power gap.<p>There were 10 or so shell fired in Newry, and unpredictable power during the Ulster Workers&#x27; Council strike of 15 to 28 May 1974. Otherwise I found nothing like a city or village being cut off for weeks with no supplies or power in Ireland, and being shelled.<p>Certainly there are historic instances of cities being cut off, like the Siege of Leningrad or the Warsaw Ghetto during WWII, and the Siege of Sarajevo during the Bosnian war. The German tally after the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising suggests that there were fewer than 100 firearms in the ghetto, and nowhere near one per family, so that&#x27;s not more a counter-example to your point. In any case, third party &quot;drug gangs&quot; or the equivalent power grab do no appear to play any significant role.<p>So I ask again, can you point to any post-war European examples?",1452897398

The number of layers was implicitly limited until recently because anything deep couldn&#x27;t be practically trained.<p>3- The activation function has very commonly in the past been an S-curve, and some of the newer better results are using a linear function that is clamped on the low end at zero, but not clamped on top.<p>All really interesting to me. This is making me want to implement and play with neural nets!<p>Of course, now the big question: if we have a neural net big enough, and it works, can we simulate a human brain? (Apparently, according to my AI researcher friend, we&#x27;re not there yet with the foundational building blocks. He mentioned researchers have tried simulating a life-form known to have a small number of neurons, like a thousand, and they can&#x27;t get it to work yet.)",1452897349

I have to do it: I work on high performance algorithmic trading systems.<p>You want to keep raw pointers, etc. confined to private class members, initialize memory only within the constructor (if possible), and free memory at the destructor. The user/public API should not expose unsafe stuff. With all this, RAII will give you a nice expectation of lifetime, etc. Plus you&#x27;re able to use something like tcmalloc.<p>I often find a difficult issue arises when you have a large data structure that you want to free before it goes out of scope (to reclaim some memory). In this case, adding a &quot;clear&quot; method that frees the internals is handy. The destructor will call clear() but you can call it at any time. No harm done if it&#x27;s called twice.<p>The next thing is const-correctness: if you follow it then any C-like code underneath should be relatively safe.<p>Not using copy constructors is just awful. Memcpy has a time and a place: at the low level (eg; I use it for serializing to a buffer). If you&#x27;re using memcpy for classes you&#x27;re probably doing something wrong.<p>Exceptions are a place where you see a wide gamut of safety.

Intel, Apple, 3Com, Compaq, DEC, and Lotus are all companies that took venture capital to get started. They are also all companies whose business model was &quot;make things and then sell them for more than they cost to make&quot; instead of &quot;aggregate a lot of eyeballs and then figure out how to make money off them later.&quot; There&#x27;s nothing special about venture capital that requires one model or the other.<p>What&#x27;s changed is the underlying need for venture capital in the first place. It was originally needed because the things startups wanted to make and sell required a huge up-front investment to get started -- building fabs or factories, hiring lots of engineers and programmers, etc. There was just no way to bootstrap a business that needed so much cash up front, so VC money made businesses possible that otherwise could not have ever gotten off the ground.<p>Nowadays the cost lots of that stuff that people had to expensively do for themselves has been commoditized down to nearly nothing, so nobody really needs VC just to <i>get started</i> anymore. What they need VC for is to <i>get big faster than their competitors,</i> in order to muscle those competitors out of the marketplace. And VCs need horses to bet on, so when all the horses are running the &quot;get big fast&quot; game, their money is going to flow towards the companies that show the best possibility of getting big fast. Which is to say, companies that make stuff and then give it away for free.<p>And there&#x27;s a prisoner&#x27;s dilemma element to that -- if you are the one VC who&#x27;s still interested in funding companies that make stuff to sell at a profit, your investments will get clobbered by competitors funded by <i>all the other VCs</i> who are giving it away.

Then they and their ilk will buy more political power.  And then the systems enters a feedback loop, which is where we are now in the US.<p>Edit: I should add that I don&#x27;t think that extreme wealth is the natural conclusion of capitalism.  In a limited government system, combined with the natural dispersion of wealth that comes from passing money down generations, I think that competition serves to keep the top 0.01% within a reasonable multiplier of the average.

People joke all the time about the crazy stuff that Siri comes up with.<p>What <i>IS</i> coming soon is automation of mindless, lower-level jobs.  Waiting tables is a good example here: humans do a terrible job of it, and add 10-20% to your food bill in exchange for screwing up your order.  Having a tablet computer on the table for you to place your own order would be better, and some restaurants already do this (like Panera) to some degree.  Factory work is another: today&#x27;s factories are filled with automation, and robots produce better-quality products than humans because they don&#x27;t make mistakes.  Taxi driving is another: we&#x27;re working on automated cars, so pretty soon &quot;Johnny Cab&quot; will be a real thing, and all those cab drivers will be out of a job.  This will extend to truck drivers pretty quickly, probably faster than cabs actually.  Fast food cooking is another: McD&#x27;s already has the job of cooking a Big Mac down to something that someone with almost no training can pick up right away because their machines do most of it, they just have to follow some pictorial directions.  People have Roombas to clean their floors.<p>So what happens when you automate all the simple jobs that don&#x27;t require an education?  Now you have a large portion of the population that&#x27;s unemployed, and they&#x27;re really not smart enough to get an education and get a higher-level job, or there&#x27;s not enough higher-level jobs to go around for them if they are.<p>It&#x27;s going to be a long time before engineers, for instance, are replaced by robots (and maybe never), but you don&#x27;t need smart people to cut grass and rake leaves, and jobs like that are going to go away before long.",1452895696

Failed to monetize effectively after virality faded and without a moat competitors did the same thing. Yelp? A web version of the BBB protection scheme whose profit comes from the shake down protection racket against small businesses, not from users. Zynga had no moat and other companies quickly did the same thing with much leaner overhead, like King and a dozen other cheap but profitable game makers. Box was just overvalued for what it is.<p>On the flip side, every time someone takes an Uber or rents a room on AirBnb, they pay the company.<p>As in, those companies accept money for every transaction and profit on them.<p>Twitter, box, groupon, yelp don&#x27;t do that. And Dropbox doesn&#x27;t and they aren&#x27;t publicly traded and if they did sell stock it would probably be overvalued and shrink over time like Box.",1452895249

There&#x27;s also hoops galore to jump through every month like applying for X amount of jobs and getting the interviewers to vouch you did in order to receive another cheque.<p>BI means you can afford to live. Welfare gives you a spot on a waiting list to get into a SRO dump full of drug addicts and $100 remainder to eat, buy hygiene products, and transportation for a month. Nobody can live off that so going to loan sharks, doing under the table exploitative labor and daily hustling are needed at least here in Canada.",1452895230

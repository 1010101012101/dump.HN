66443,comment,66442,66442,0,0,foof,,,"Its often said that the startups are successful, especially by the venture capitalist firms who fund these startups. It is hard to say, what is intention behind the claim of saying most of the startups as successful, because as far as we could find on the internet there is not a single place which contains the facts and the figures about the success and the failure of the new ventures.<p>
And if so that the people were successful, who were they from were did they start, were their background as modest, or where they some geeks like Einstein or from the Wharton business school?<p>Is there is a place where we can find who these people where and what was special in idea which made them successful? All that are  stated at time are bug names like Sabeer 
Bhatia, and Steve Jobs. But definitely all cant be them, and that's for sure. <p>In short is there any study available which can confirm or prove that taking a risk is not foolishness, but its a calculated path that could take you to success.<p>

66439,comment,66292,66362,0,0,mrtron,,,"I would add something to why a degree is useful:
A degree forces you to learn things that you would otherwise not learn.  I hate stats, but I had to learn stats.  It has surprisingly proved useful in my work from time to time.  The same follows with about 100 other things I was forced to learn, and that have popped up.  Usually they are relatively obscure topics you have no interest in and avoid, but occasionally they are whole subjects that you just dislike.",1192131780

Now obviously, not everyone needs a degree; and not everyone with a degree is good.  But from personal experience, it was well worth the time, money and effort to get a degree.
I went to a school that is heavy on the math and algorithm side of CS, which was quite useful. <p>If you have already started a degree, I would consider that another motivating factor to continue, you are already pot committed (if you know poker terms).",1192131461

66426,comment,66292,66390,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"> Do programming work get boring in a business-setting?<p>Yes. One of the things you aren't going to hear too much on a site that promotes the start-up lifestyle is that 80% of the work you are going to be doing is not intellectually interesting in any way. It is somewhat interesting from a ""holy shit I can't believe life is really like this"" perspective, but if you are into ideas that aren't just superfically interesting it can be a real drain. <p>On the other hand, I did a year of grad school after working for four years and I couldn't believe how much it was like ""The Office."" Most people just surfed the internet, played fantasy sports games online, went to every journal-club/data-sharing/journal-data-sharing club event, and did the bare minimum of work to get by. <p>I'm not sure what to tell you. If I had to do it all again, I would have gone to grad school straight out of college, finished version 1.0 of my product during the first year of graduate school, then dropped out and turned it into a business.

66422,comment,66344,66344,0,0,hugh,,,"For the most part though, I suspect that for most non-US-citizen entrepreneurs, the question ""Should I move to Silicon Valley?"" is a bit like the questions ""Should I grow a pair of wings on my back?"" or ""Should I enlist the Loch Ness Monster as a cofounder?"" It might be nice to do it, but given the difficulty of getting a visa as an entrepreneur, it's not really an option.

66416,comment,66313,66328,0,0,brk,,,"I don't really agree with this logic.  If you're building something that people want, your target audience should reach far beyond friends and friends-of-friends.  If people <i>want</i> something, they're likely looking for it via a search engine these days.  Neglecting search engine ranking is neglecting a large amount of potential customers that you could likely be acquiring for a very low cost.<p>I could make a counter case to your argument: If the majority of your users <i>aren't</i> discovering you via Google, your product doesn't have a wide enough audience to be viable.",1192129679

He basically argues that the key requirements for an industry hub are: large companies for R&D and M&A, Research Universities for research and tech transfer, Investment Groups for access to capital, and knowledge workers with applicable skills. <p>In the web/tech space there is no argument that SV provides the right mix of resources and is the leading technology hub.<p>Where the EU and metro regions in the US can improve is increasing the linkages between these groups and thus making it easier for entreps to succeed there. <p>Many of the examples Ryan provided in his post are examples of the progress that has been made in Europe.

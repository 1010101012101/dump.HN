Admittedly, if you aren't used to it, it does look weird; however, once you <i>are</i> used to it--and it doesn't take too long--it makes the code readable.<p>In particular, it naturally splits apart the different function calls. So you can look at the parts separately: L.intercalate ""\n"", cut (b'-b+1), map toChar, elems arr. Now you have a nice little pipeline.<p>Perhaps to somebody without Haskell experience, the version with parentheses would be easier to understand:<p><pre><code>    L.intercalate ""\n"" (cut (b'-b+1) (map toChar (elems arr)))
</code></pre>
However, in general, I find the $ version easier to follow.<p>I also think that this version is better than the same code broken up into arbitrary temporary variables. The pipeline is short and clear; adding temporary bindings would just give me more things to keep in my mind at the same time.<p>One way to think about this is that the $ is very similar to the | in bash, just backwards. So in a bash-like pseudocode, this is something like:<p><pre><code>    elems arr | map toChar | cut (b' - b+1) | L.intercalate ""\n""
</code></pre>
Hopefully that clarifies the structure of the code and why that structure is actually very reasonable.<p>Basically, my point is that the given code is clear and simple; chances are you find it hard to read because Haskell is somewhat foreign and not because the given code is particularly complicated or obfuscated. In fact, I think this way of writing the code is clearer than what you would get in most other languages because it forms a very clear sequence of transformations on the input.",1359837620

Stealing a horse is a factual matter which can often be established very easily, and the severe penalty was a rational response to the fact that losing a horse was a often major blow to the victim's livelihood or prospects of survival. This is wholly different to saying someone is inferior because of their ethnicity or gender, or because they have traffic with imaginary beings whose existence cannot be proven.<p><i>It should not be the case that ""everyone is guilty of something.""</i><p>But they're not, and people who make the claim that they are tend to cherry-pick their examples. There's a meme that floats around HN to the effect that you could pluck some random person off the street and find enough laws that they're breaking to put them away for years, so we're pretty much living in a police state. This is simply not true.<p><i>A substantial part of a fraudulent scheme was committed from outside the United States? [You don't live in the United States, or your ""accomplice"" doesn't, or you went on vacation with your laptop a couple of times.] The offense otherwise involved sophisticated means? [She's a witch! Burn her!]</i><p>Oh FFS. Sophisticated means simply points to the degree of elaboration involved in criminal behavior and thus to degree of intent. It's the same in murder trials; the most severe penalties are given to people who murder by lying-in-wait for a victim or using some method like poison which demonstrates extensive forethought, as opposed to loss of self-control, such as a shooting someone you just had a fight with. These concepts of intent being proportional to criminal culpability are far from new, and they're not vague because they are evaluated in the context of precedent.<p><i>Offense involved an intent to obtain personal information? [Almost all computers contain personal information; good luck arguing that it wasn't your ""intent"" to ""obtain"" it in any given case.]</i><p>It's the prosecution's job to prove intent, and it's very easy to shoot holes in it if it's incidental to the prosecution's main case.<p><i>>I have read plenty of cases being prosecuted as attempted murder that don't make the news<p>It doesn't surprise me that prosecutors would file charges like that, but do these non-murderers actually plead guilty to murder or get convicted of it?</i><p>Well, it's kind of hard to get convicted of murder if you are charged with attempted murder, now isn't it? My point is that when you hear of two people being in a bar fight you <i>assume</i> that it wasn't that severe, whereas I find nothing remarkable in the idea that a bar fight can escalate into an attempt on someone's life.<p><i>[...] people more likely to be innocent are still offered plea bargains specifically calculated in order to make them take the offer rather than go to trial.</i><p>People more likely to be innocent are also more likely to go to trial. Prosecutors don't want to bring cases that they can lose. As with the Aaron Swartz case, and as with virtually every death penalty appeals case, innocense often becomes a proxy for third parties' wishes about how things could be rather than how they actually were.<p><i>I don't understand how you can say that risking an order of magnitude higher penalty is ""no incentive"" -- the numbers speak for themselves. If there is no incentive then why does almost no one go to trial?</i><p>You're not following my argument. I'm saying that <i>if</i> we implement your notion of drastically reducing the difference between the offered plea and the sentence a prosecutor will seek at trial, <i>then</i> criminals would have no incentive to avoid the trial. Think about it: if I asked you to plead guilty in return for 10 years, or face the possibility of a ten-year sentence at trial, you'd go trial, wouldn't you?<p><i>They should be able to offer a small reduction from what the result is expected be at trial. Offering to cut the penalty more than in half is entirely too coercive; the expected penalty at trial should be less than double what plea offers are currently.</i><p>Why a factor of two, based on what? If you are obviously guilty and you don't like the prosecution's offer, you can always reject the plea bargain but plead guilty and make a case in the sentencing phase.<p>I agree with you that US sentencing in general is too draconian and that prosecutors often abuse their bargaining power. But you're proposing procedural solutions to a problem that is arguably the result of excessive proceduralism, viz. the exhaustive and cumulative nature of sentencing guidelines. You want say you want laws that are very narrowly tailored and specific, and to a large extent <i>that's how things are</i>. We might be better off with more vague laws that left judges more freedom to look at the totality of the circumstances, but some of the time that's going to result in drastic over-sentencing. Procedural specificity is a double-edged sword; if you don't want to see sentences of one day longer than the very specific offenses charges (because that would be unjust) then you have a hard time arguing for sentences that are shorter than the specific offenses indicated by the available evidence.",1359837402

We can take a testable metric like body weight, and apply rigorous analysis of contributing factors, like eating habits and exercise, and arrive at a more-or-less objective conclusion like, ""Feeding kids lots of sugar will make them fat."" That's not a conclusion that's amenable to subjective analysis, and non-parents are as capable of drawing them as parents are (and in fact, non-parents may be better, because...)<p>There is also an intuitive approach to parenting, which is how most parenting decisions actually get made, because once you get the little details of keeping your kid alive and healthy taken care of, you start running into abstract problems like, ""I want my child to have a happy and fulfilled life,"" for which really actionable scientific evidence is thin on the ground. Parents develop this intuition over the course of years of near-<i>constant</i> exposure to their children, where every single little thing they do has some consequence which they have nowhere near enough time or energy to seriously consider. It's the sort of problem our brains are made to solve, and generally it works out okay.<p>Consider that if you <i>aren't</i> a parent or full-time-plus childcare professional, you have something like one one <i>thousandth</i> that level of interaction with children, and much less in a custodial role.

In the discussion are a layman, who has never used the language, and an amateur, with fifty <i>thousand</i> hours of subject matter experience.

This stuff is just common sense.""<p>The amateur replies, ""I understand it looks like common sense to you, but, in the nicest way possible, you just don't know anything about this.""<p>The layman protests, ""Of course I know about it! I use computers almost every day, and so does everyone here.""<p>The amateur is frustrated. ""That's... not really the same thing as programming at all.""<p>The layman feels challenged. ""Okay, if you're the big expert here, why don't you just share some of this so-called <i>expertise</i> with the rest of us?""<p>The amateur is perplexed.

5157188,comment,5155816,5157000,3,0,lsc,,,"salary/1000 is pretty good in my experience;  I've usually gotten less than that (going through agencies)   Getting /more/ than that is quite difficult.  (I mean, the agency gets that for you, sure, but they aren't going to pay you anywhere near that.)<p>As an example, uh, last time I contracted full-time, I got $72/hr on a corp to corp basis.   Right before that I was getting around $105K/year as a full time W2.   (Last I looked, I was offered $95/hr, but had to back out 'cause one of my employees left for a better job, so I no longer had the time to rent myself out full time, and they didn't want me part-time.  It was a good gig, too- just my thing.  The company had just been bought and gutted, everyone that  could had left.  Just the sort of smoldering heap that I like.)    I mean, obviously, if you value job security (I don't)  then moving from $105K/year to $72/hr is a really stupid move... but I don't value job security, and I wanted to dump money into my hosting operation, so it was a reasonable choice for me.  It's likely that I tipped my hand, though, and acted a bit too eager during the negotiations, and left some money on the table, but I don't think I could have pulled off $100/hr at the time. that was before I was published.<p>But yeah;  from what I see with the agencies?  They have lower expectations... much lower expectations than someone hiring on direct to the client, but they don't pay all that much better.  On the upside, standards are low and if you are good, they keep you in easy work.<p>(It's also possible that I simply haven't fount the right agencies.)<p>It's different if you are going direct with a large corporation, but that's very hard to do.  Usually large corporations want a buffer corporation between  you and them (and a corporation you set up that derives all it's revenue from your consulting doesn't seem to count)<p>The rules are much loser for smaller clients, but smaller clients, generally speaking, don't pay nearly as much.<p>Where I am?  It's difficult to get most agencies to do 1099 or corp to corp these days;  most want you as a W2, which means you are taxed exactly as an employee.  There's some law that essentially prohibits one-person consulting corporations, or something like that.<p>I've always negotiated a corp to corp deal, as I have a corporation that does other stuff, and when I consult, it's for venture capital, so for me, the tax benefits are very real (e.g. I get to spend the money on servers or support salary pre-tax)    of course, any money I want to pass through to me, I've gotta pay the 15% on, as you point out.",1359836552

Specifically, I believe a Scheme-based approach is the best way to learn programming, even if you eventually decide to migrate to something less fortunate like Javascript or Python ... in under an hour from your first exposure you can be thinking about stuff rather than the syntax of loops.  I won't attempt to justify the pedagogical reasons for this choice here.<p>Specifically, I'd recommend (1) using Racket, a ""batteries-included"" Scheme derivative with a simple IDE/debugger, and either (2)  <i>Concrete Abstractions</i> (free at <a href=""https://gustavus.edu/+max/concrete-abstractions-annotated-toc/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gustavus.edu/+max/concrete-abstractions-annotated-to...</a>), or (3) the upcoming book <i>Realm of Racket</i> (coming in May), which will cover some of the same CS 101 material as well as GUI and distributed programming via writing games in Racket.  (There is an earlier book called <i>Land of Lisp</i> but I feel its environment (CLISP) and coding practices are rather baroque.)<p>Depending on your student's interests you could simultaneously look at some web programming (plenty of HTML/CSS material is available from Mozilla, Google, etc.; there's an upcoming Udacity course on HTML5 game programming), lower-level stuff like assembly, arduino, or whatever.<p>Hope this helps.",1359835744

Part of the 'value' they add for employers is to vet candidates before they are interviewed by the employer.   This consists of doing a web page background search, calling your references, and giving you a pee test.  Also see #1 for why this is a waste of time.<p>3.  You will be legally bound to a three way relationship between the recruiter co. and your new employer.  There are no benefits to you in this binding agreement.<p>4.  You may actually be paid by the recruiting agency's payroll department  (contracting).  Faxing time sheets to a fax machine no one bothers to fill with paper at the agency office is a waste of time and energy.  To put it another way, you won't be able to talk to the payroll department directly if you have any issues.<p>5.

It's not even about 'race' - many people from visible minorities, in mainland France and mostly in oversea french departments are quite happy about who they are and how they live, and their culture.<p>There is something else- more pervasive. It's hard to express.<p>The best analysis I have is people like to classify themselves and others. For some reason, many people - especially in France - want to self identify as 'not the same as the local people' if given the chance, and this is reinforced by how most people see them and judge them.<p>I know about diversity - hell, I'm only partially french myself - I could want to do that.<p>Luck or fate didn't make me do that - I do not classify myself as anything.

Even people I've known for a long time and who would have no reason to. And I've seen the same thing happening in the neighbouring coutries.<p>It is not like the US - where for some reason, the heavy majority people born in the US from different countries and background become proud of being associated with the country and claim themselves as americans, and do not hate the other - at least not too much. Not as much as I've seen in Europe - replace 'french' / 'not french' and it seems to work the same way.<p>I currently live in a french oversea departement, where I'm the visible minority. >90% of the population is african american, but for some reason, it all goes well, there are not major trouble.

There are factual reasons why, according to the theories I had (similar to yours: poverty, greed) there should be some serious trouble.<p>It's no paradise, but yet it goes well, there is a kind of unity. So I don't believe it is just about social issues.<p>It's as if the ""homogeneity"" played a positive role - as in, people can relate to eachother and don't feel threatned by eachother, a kind of trust in the social contract, enforced by this homogeneity, a positive reinforcement.<p>I'm not sure this is the right explanation.

If the kid doesn't understand addition anyway, and asks what is 2+2, why not tell them 4? What would be the rationale to say it's 5, what is ""working"" here? It answered the question, but so would the correct answer.<p><i>Then you might realize that, yes, not knowing anything about parenting actually does mean you have no basis to evaluate parenting decisions.</i><p>If that parenting knowledge gives people expert insight, why don't they share it? Why hide behind ""only parents would understand"" (even ignoring that some parents disagree with them)? Why not refute the so obviously wrong armchair amateur advice with the correct facts? I see lots of talk, where is the money?<p><i>not knowing anything about parenting actually does mean you have no basis to evaluate parenting decisions.</i><p>It's cute, but sadly I saw what you did there: What or who, other than asexually reproducing life forms, or maybe those that lay eggs, does not know <i>anything</i> about parenting?",1359835576

One thing currying seems to look like is a builder pattern for functional programming. I can start with a function that requires N number of different arguments. I can use currying to accumulate specific setting for the function over time. Eventually when I get everything actually required for the function, I can invoke it.",1359835539

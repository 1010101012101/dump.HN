Theyre <i>years</i> ahead of Google App Engine!<p><i>Addendum:</i> The previous statement is slightly tongue-in-cheek, but: (1) GAE is running a version of Python (2.5) so old, that its hard to get fully patched binaries of it anymore (depending on your platform); and (2) By years ahead,I dont mean it will take Google years to catch up, but merely that their Python version is years old. Puzzling, given that Guido works for Google and has for years.<p><i>Second Addendum:</i> Linked: an issue opened in 2008 pleading Google to add 2.6 support. Three whole years ago.

Barnes & Noble seems to be such an afterthought that the Nook Color gets little attention though it is the directly competing product in terms of product specs and price (though the NC price will have to come down from $249 to $199 or below to compete).<p>The NC curently has what I think is a large advantage in that its easy to root via the microSD slot so it becomes a fully functioning Android tablet, including Android Market.  The KF can provide Amazon media - for users, does this outweigh access to the Android market and native access to Google products?  The NC still got nowhere near the appreciation from the public in its history that the Kindle Fire got in one day.<p>I'm curious as to what strategy Barnes & Noble takes with regards to NC in resposne to KF.  A reliable source tells me that the NC is 85% owned by women and the targeted primary audience for its apps are 30+ women.  There are few free apps because BN doesn't want to create an expectation of ""everything should be free"" (i.e. get users used to paying for value).  The targeted audience also is one less opposed to paying for something nor have time to find free hacks (unlike young males).  I don't think this market will be sufficient to keep the Kindle Fire from dominating at the $200 price point.  Everyone, including not-yet-purchased-a-tablet 30+ women, will soon likely hear of the Kindle Fire and BN will lose much of its small core audience.<p>Given the $200 price point, I think that there may be an oppotunity for BN to make a large mainstream splash if it allows greater flexibility in the NC (including fully integrating Android Market).  Otherwise, I don't see how it competes with Amazon because of ""coolness"" perceptions of the two companies.  In that respect, Amazon competes with Apple; while BN competes with Borders (RIP).",1317249118

That doesn't mean the message should be ""give up.""<p>I don't think the question is over whether it is worth it to fight for online privacy, but rather if online privacy is the right end goal to begin with.<p>People are very uncomfortable with radical openness and transparency of their personal lives because it is a radical departure from the way life used to operate.  People have always been uncomfortable with technologically driven cultural changes (easy examples would be the original Luddite movement or luddites today), and probably always will be.  Online privacy gives an ironic twist on the situation since many hackers, the people who should be pushing the world forward, are disturbed by this change and want to hold it back.<p>Facebook, and more recently Google (with their real name push), have moved to envision this different mode of human interaction.  In its extreme incarnation, your digital and 'physical' lives are inextricably merged.  I don't think this is a trend that can or should be fought: it would mean fighting the integration of technology with day to day life, and so would eventually be analagous to fighting the benefits technology can bring to human life. With this integration, though, your personal life accessible to those who want it.  Yes, having everything be open is very different and uncomfortable.  But look at the environment created by allowing total anonymity: 4chan /b/.

785984,comment,785205,785948,0,0,ars,,,"> Even if one does as you do (i.e., measure energy in dollars) I smell a unit mismatch: left side of your ""equation"": dollars per hour right side of your ""equation"": dollars per human<p>> which would only make sense if you also show that 1 human = 1 hour... perhaps I should stop now.<p>Come on, I thought you would do that yourself.<p>Fine:<p><pre><code>  capita := person/year
  person/year * 260(work days/year) * 8(hours/day) = person/hour
  
  energy/capita = energy/person/hour

  $/hour := $/person/hour

  energy/person/hour = $/person/hour

  energy = $
</code></pre>
Seriously, you could not do that yourself?<p>As to your second paragraph - someone is paying for those people. You are basically shifting the energy cost of your free software program onto the energy cost of whatever they are doing for money. Which is exactly right. People will do _something_ with their free time, and the energy cost of that item, should be, and is 0. Since if they did not do one thing, they would do another.<p>But if they got paid less, they would do less. So whoever pays them is the one responsible for their energy usage.<p>> I think it makes sense to look at the energy used to produce a product without looking at how much the product costs""<p>Except that they are the same thing. Let me shift a question to you: Which energy costs of manufacturing will you include, and which will you exclude? On a previous post you excluded materials and wages. I can sort of understand wages, but why exclude energy cost of materials?<p>> Your model says that we don't need an energy yield measure for wind turbines - because energy yield is the same as return on investment.<p>Correct. You keep coming up with these points that are totally correct. So I think you understand me very well (despite the silly thing about capita and $/hour).",1251237253

As far as I can tell, it's not a quality issue. I've had repeat business from almost all my past customers and none of the others were unhappy as far as I can tell, and I've had zero downtime for over 6 months now after starting 15 months ago.<p>Yet, if I give a straight hourly figure, 90% of the time I'm either told it's too much or I never hear back at all. I do a little better when quoting a fixed price based on the same hourly rate (plus buffers, etc), but many times the work is too ill-defined to come up with a definite offer, so it comes down to giving an hourly rate, with the usual result.<p>I've had the most success and repeat business with extremely time-sensitive projects, or projects that have gone off the rails and need turning around. I charge about 50% more if I'm basically being asked to work day and night. Once the work is done and done well (and it always is), I can generally get future projects at the standard rate with no major trouble.<p>I've reluctantly tried the loss-leader strategy of charging less on the first project, and as expected it's not terribly effective.<p>So as far as I can tell, the issue isn't so much the price as proving I'm worth it. How do you guys handle referrals, references, etc.?<p>A lot of my work involves NDAs (as it's often subcontracted), which makes referring to existing work and customers extremely difficult. I have a few customers who are brilliant and who I can use as references, but as far as I know, nobody has ever followed them up. Other than literally becoming known by everyone in the area, what other options do I have? Am I expecting a higher conversion rate than I should be? How do I go about finding more well-paying customers?<p>Maybe I'm tending to the wrong niches, too. My background is mainly in high performance computing, game tech and web apps.<p>- I've had zero HPC freelance work, and no leads either. No clue where to find them.<p>- I've had a sizeable amount of game tech programming, but getting reasonable money from game devs seems to be like squeezing blood from a stone.<p>- The web app business can yield better results, but there's a sea of awful programmers (who seem to exclusively know PHP for whatever reason) out there who call themselves web developers. Their hourly rates are dirt cheap, but their efficiency is lower still. I still can't reliably get this through to potential customers.<p>- The easiest money is in business-y/enterprise-y development. Except the only way I seem to be able to do this is via subcontracting, which is suboptimal because it's the middle man getting the reputation.<p>I'm not sure what other areas are more lucrative. Embedded stuff seems like a good fit to my skill set (game console development isn't far off) but I have no clue how to even find potential customers. I'm not sure how or where best to sell myself to enterprise-y businesses.",1251235923

785845,comment,785477,785733,0,0,Perceval,,,"In an ideal world, the purpose of political speech is to persuade.  Mackey's piece, while inflammatory in parts, is an argument that he intends to persuade at least some people.<p>In an ideal world, the appropriate response to political speech that one find's wrong, objectionable, erroneous, or otherwise misleading is to engage in political speech yourself.  The cure for political speech is more political speech.<p>However, I agree with you that the average person does not have the same level of access to venues for political speech that Mackey does.  It's not easy to get pride of place on the WSJ editorial page.  Not even terribly easy to get your letter to the editor printed.<p>Nevertheless, we have to ask ourselves what the purpose of the boycott is.  We can all agree that free people are necessarily free to spend their money where they like, going out of their way to avoid certain brands in favor of others.  Usually, we avoid brands because the products that the brand represents are flawed, sub-par, or fraudulent.  Obviously, this is not the case with the Whole Foods boycott.  Boycotting Whole Foods for the political speech of its CEO is an action not directed at Whole Foods per se, but at the political opinion of one man responsible for the company.<p>Will affecting Whole Foods' bottom-line persuade Mackey?  Will it persuade the rest of the public?  Unlikely in either case.  A boycott of this sort is not meant to persuade, it's meant to <i>punish</i>.  This is why people like the author of the linked article and others think that this kind of boycott crosses the line from civil speech to incivility.  The rationale seems to be: if we can't persuade Mackey or achieve a place on a soapbox comparable to his, then perhaps we can punish him enough that he will regret having spoken up.<p>Seeking to punish Mackey for expressing his opinion is not an equivalent act of free speech.  It crosses the line into incivility.",1251234171

It has enabled us to repay debt and cut taxes.

More than 1 million more patients are being treated each year and there are 8,000 more doctors and 53,000 more nurses to treat them.<p>That is the record of eleven and a half years of Conservative Government and Conservative principles.

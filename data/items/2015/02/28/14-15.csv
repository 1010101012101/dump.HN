Weekend vs workday patterns? (The cat proabally doesn&#x27; care if it&#x27;s the weekend, but thi changes a lot the patterns of the humans and that will probably affect the paterns of the cat.)

I&#x27;ve been a big fan of John Willis for awhile and the  challenge that he, Gene Kim, and others have taken on to fix enterprise IT culture should be commended.  They hit the nail on the head when they state that DevOps isn&#x27;t about Puppet and Chef or the latest hotness on Github, but that the key to it is culture.  The tools can help automate some processes, but without fixing the underlying culture it&#x27;s missing the point.<p>The Phoenix Project should be required reading for all IT professionals, especially senior leadership.

It can vary not just based on code changes you&#x27;ve made, but also based on how many users you have or how much data they have.  This is why libraries should just strive to be fast rather than get hung up on hot paths because hot paths are invariably going to be different for each library user.<p>Taking that a step further, you&#x27;ve started in Ruby, it was fast enough, now you have a performance issue.  Your options are: ignore it; make Ruby faster; use a faster idiom; somehow push this off to a C or Java extension; or rewrite in a new language.  Rewrites have a spectacular failure rate.  Ignoring it is bad for business.  Ruby is already implemented in C and Java, so if you&#x27;re going to go down the extension path to make a core language feature faster, you may as well just make Ruby faster -- it&#x27;s virtually the same effort.  And using faster idioms is just the lowest cost option.",1425135033

9123774,comment,9123019,9123019,0,0,jasonvision,,,"This is a pretty cool concept. It obviously has a lot of overlap with Meetup (which I&#x27;ve used for years) though I like the fact that it is more immediate. Meetup tends to involve RSVP&#x27;ing for an event upfront and many times events are closed days in advance. As a business owner myself, sometimes I just don&#x27;t know when I&#x27;ll have time off and like the spontaneity that something like Four&Me could offer. I think you need to start with a specific region though. It could be quite discouraging for users to login somewhere (like London) and see nothing happening around them. It makes it more likely to uninstall the app and not even consider using it again... Not quite sure how you could go about doing this.<p>To address some of the criticism surrounding facebook logins - yes, this may be a put-off for some people, but then it has also worked remarkably well for a lot of apps, and for most non-tech-savvy users, it changes the registration process from filling in multiple fields, to a couple of clicks - I personally think there is an appeal to that, particularly for a new product. Plus, you&#x27;re not asking for <i>too</i> much from users when they connect through FB (though perhaps you could cut this down even further - do you really need my interests? Or could this be another step where I could just click and type a few myself?).<p>Good luck with the app! Hope to see it grow!",1425134937

You write a function, test it in the REPL, and forget about it.  Until, of course, someone hands it data you weren&#x27;t expecting.  But here Clojure helps you a bit with it&#x27;s effort to provide consistent interfaces to its collection types, e.g. lists, vectors and maps.  And the most expressive and fast to write code in, the more time you can devote to testing.<p>I&#x27;ll bet <i>in practice</i> this sort of TDD works very well, as long as your coders are diligent.  For the projects I&#x27;ve done this way, including a couple in C using a very good but now defunct interpretive environment for it (CenterLine&#x27;s CodeCenter/ObjectCenter), it&#x27;s been superb.  In an extreme case, I spent around a week programming in C the engine of a high speed document imaging scanning system, at which point I got the driver that let me speak directly to the scanner.  The first time I tried it end-to-end it worked ... until I ran out of file descriptors (had forgotten to close() each file after writing out its contents).<p>There was of course a whole lot of experience that made that feat possible, but I found it very impressive how the environment allowed me to write code with so few flaws (that was, in fact, the only major one I can remember once I declared a function finished and ready to try out for real).",1425133132

9418429,comment,9417896,9417896,0,0,dalke,,,"> If you follow TDD, you ensure the line of code is covered by writing the test first, ensuring it fails, then writing the line that makes it pass.<p>This isn&#x27;t quite true. There are two ways to lose line coverage. The first is if new code duplicates a case that was previous caught elsewhere. For example, suppose current code handles n>=0, with a special where n=0 returns 0, and the new code handles n<=0 by returning 0.<p>It&#x27;s not always clear when new code shadows the old code path, leaving it with under 100% coverage.<p>The other way is through refactoring. My usual example is to replace string search implementation using the naive O(n*m) algorithm with the KMP algorithm, keeping the API unchanged. The KMP machinery is more complicated, and it&#x27;s unlikely that the tests used to drive the naive implementation will be enough to validate the refactor.<p>Following the &quot;fear-driven development&quot; methodology means adding more test until you&#x27;re confident the refactor was valid. But this is &quot;test last&quot;, and not part of TDD.<p>I&#x27;m much more an FDD practitioner than I am a TDD one. :) And the idea of live code coverage sounds great to me.",1429671025

9418416,comment,9410592,9410592,0,0,brickcap,,,"It seems to me that this person has taken a lot of time researching about contracts. Much of text is filled with legal definitions rather the actual terms of agreement. No lawyer writes a contract like this (at the very least I&#x27;ve never seen a contract written like this) .The intention clearly is to give off the impression that it was drafted by a lawyer, which I highly doubt.<p>Also the quality of language  in the definitions and the quality of the language in the actual clauses does not match. Which could mean that the definitions were simply copy/pasted from internet but when it came to writing the actual stuff the person making the offer had nowhere to turn to.<p>So what you fear is that the client is asking to to fulfil your promise to the contract that you linked. Reading the contract and the context that you have given, here are some of the things that I&#x27;ve noticed. My responses are with respect to the Indian contract law :-<p>_&quot;and any designing or development you own or have or will have rights to, any that  you have previously created or will create in the future ...&quot;_<p>This is void since it is not legally enforceable. A clause must be specific  as to what the promise or the consideration for promise should be. What this clause says is neither specific nor foreseeable.<p>_&quot;in return for you services and full agreement to the above terms in condition I will be allowing you to purchase a website with control panel through us or the company we use&quot;_<p>Okay this was funny :) So the author of the contract reads up on contract law and decides to draft one. He puts forward some absurd clauses and says to himself<p>&quot;Gee what should I give the other party in return for consideration of the promise?&quot;<p>And he gives you the _right_ to buy stuff for him. This is like when you go to a fruit vendor and pay him Rs 40 to buy a dozen bananas and he says &quot;Brother since you have given me Rs 40 to buy the bananas I give you the right to buy apples from this shop&quot;. Won&#x27;t work in a court of law.<p>_&quot;You also give up all rights to file a suit again my self or anyone involving me , you will give up the right to lawyer up and file a suit against me or anyone I associate with.&quot;_<p>This clause is void. The right to file a law suit can not be taken away in any case by anyone. It does not matter if you have agreed to do so in a contract or not.<p>First the promise required is not specific. Then there is no consideration of promise. On top of that the person is taking away your right to appear before a court of law. All three clauses are void. The contract is void.

I managed to stay abroad so long on so little by not partying, hitch-hiking, traveling overnight on trains when possible to avoid accommodation costs (helped by occasional travelling without marking it in my euro-train ticket - sorry rail people), spent a couple weeks in friends/family accommodation, largely lived on bread rolls you often get complimentary at hostels and taking a few extra and buying some deli meat/cheese to make sandwiches for lunch/dinner.<p>And more locally at that age I did hitch-hiking trips when on uni holidays, sleeping rough often.

I wont deny there is some increased risk, personally having one rather scary encounter with a crazy person but that&#x27;s also part of the adventure of travel anywhere you want to go off-track.

Authorization is necessary because playing audio out of a non-default device may be unexpected behavior to the user, and may cause a nuisance. For example, suppose a user is in a library or other quiet public place where she is using a laptop with system audio directed to a USB headset. Her expectation is that the laptop’s audio is private and she will not disturb others. If any Web application can direct audio output through arbitrary output devices, a mischievous website may play loud audio out of the laptop’s external speakers without the user’s consent.<p>> To prevent these kinds of nuisance scenarios, the user agent must acquire the user’s consent to access non-default audio output devices. This would prevent the library example outlined earlier, because the application would not be authorized to play out audio from the system speakers.<p>> The default audio output device is always authorized.<p>:-(<p><pre><code>    [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/audio-output/#privacy-consent (section 5.1)</code></pre>",1429669195

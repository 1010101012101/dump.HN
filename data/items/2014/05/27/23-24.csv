If you read this article and think &quot;Now I&#x27;m going to apply to YC and do good!&quot;, you&#x27;ve probably got lower chances of success than the average YC founder.<p>That&#x27;s one reason we point out that the expected value mainly depends on your chances of being the next Dropbox or AirBnb, which probably involves having a huge passion for fixing a particular problem.<p>On the other hand, I don&#x27;t think the information should have no impact on decisions. For instance, I think someone at college could read this, and set themselves on a path towards <i>becoming the type of person</i> who makes a good entrepreneur. They could learn to program, hang out around startup people, try out their ideas. They could find a problem and <i>become</i> passionate about it.",1401235144

Erlang has amazing properties but Haskell can, honestly, do much of it better and faster and safer.<p>Erlang has Dialyzer and type annotations and quickcheck. Use it all religiously because your Erlang programs will get big and messy fast.<p>What made me switch?

We pull that data daily into Redshift, and this allows us to run historical reports and discover patterns of user behavior within the mobile app.<p>> Is all this running continuously, or different schedules for each worker? Any of these event based rather than schedule based?<p>The Extractors are Schedule based. So with Mixpanel for example we do a daily dump around 4am (once all the Mixpanel data is available for export).<p>With our Rails events we push them to IronMQ and the scheduler kicks off workers every 15 mins to pull them off.<p>The `Transformers` and `Loaders` are event based.

Many years ago I did process control programming of machines in a large expensive clean room assembly line. Amazing machines, custom built, handed materials off to the next machine in the line.  It turned out that the materials could move around, just a few millimeters, in their plastic carriers.  If the carrier didn&#x27;t settle in quite snuggly and the materials happened to be sitting in just the wrong place, the machines would smash through all of the materials in the carrier because it didn&#x27;t &quot;see&quot; them while looking/smashing through the carrier.  Of course, the mechanical engineers could fix the optical system that looked for materials, but the software guys were able to solve the problem in just a few hours.  They had the machines &quot;wiggle&quot; the carrier when it was loaded to make sure the optical system saw any materials present.<p>After this experience, the mechanical engineers and software engineers worked together to ensure that there was a comprehensive API for the machines so that software could fix, modify, or enhance the machines operation.",1401233544

The point you&#x27;re dancing around is whether the system should permit grave actions that don&#x27;t make any sense when you&#x27;re designing the system.<p>By the rules, every single system on a commercial aircraft has a circuit breaker. Pilots make the &quot;what if X catches on fire?&quot; case, which is actually pretty compelling. However, that also means there are several switches overhead that will ostensibly crash the airplane if pulled. Pilots lobby very strongly for the aircraft not to fight them in any way because they are the only ones with the data, in the moment, now. They have final command over the aircraft in every way.<p>I use this to point out that as you&#x27;re designing systems for operations people -- something we&#x27;re increasingly doing ourselves as devops/SRE takes hold -- you might think you can anticipate every scenario and design suitable safeguards into the system. However, sometimes, when Halley&#x27;s Comet refracts some moonlight into swamp gas and takes your fleet down, you as an operator have to do some really crazy shit. It&#x27;s in that moment, when all hell has broken loose, I&#x27;m at the helm, and based on the data available to me I have made a decision to shoot the system in the head: if the system fights me and prolongs an outage because we argued about whether we&#x27;d ever need to reboot a fleet all at once, I&#x27;m replacing the system as the first item in my postmortem. If you make me walk row to row flipping PDUs, we&#x27;re going to have words.<p>That&#x27;s just my philosophy. Give the operators the knives and let them cut themselves, trusting that you&#x27;ve hired smart people and understanding mistakes will happen. Your philosophy may vary. By all means, ask me to confirm. Ask me for a physical key, even. But if you ever prevent me from doing what I know must be done, you are in my way. I have yet to meet a system that is smarter than an operator when the shit hits the fan (<i>especially</i> when the shit hits the fan).<p>There&#x27;s probably a broader term for operational philosophy like this.",1401233068

In the very few cases I&#x27;ve seen where there is a noticeable difference it was always because the Python version was decoding Unicode and the shell tools were running with LC_ALL=C, which meant that corrupt data made it further before being caught and, in some cases, either failing to match all of the records or subtly quietly things by not extracting all of a combined character, etc.<p>For the target use-case, however, this is likely all to be many, many orders of magnitude less than the time most people would spend debugging regex patterns.",1401232919

Aren&#x27;t they the same thing? Isn&#x27;t minimizing losses effectively mean maximizing wins? Give me an example where minimizing losses is not the same as maximizing wins. The only cases where it is not is if you haven&#x27;t vetted out (or could not vet ) the complete outcome of all possible moves that you can make next, for example chess, where the game tree could be of infinite (or deep enough to process in reasonable time) depth.<p>But chess programs are coded to try all possible tree paths to a reasonable depth given the time constraints and pick a move that has the best weight/score/winning chances. Not a move that has least losses. From that perspective it is all about maximizing the chances of winning. Although I am sure they are also coded to recognize draw conditions and play for draw if that is more effective. So it is not so dry and cut.<p>So when you are not sure of the certainty of the outcome of the several possible moves you could make next in a game, the best strategy is to pick the one with maximum winning chances not minimal losses. Especially if you think the opposite party is also going to play to win. Next, if your chances of losing are increasing, then play for draw first and lastly mutual destruction (to force the opposite player to draw)<p>Even in the &#x27;cold war roots&#x27; that you mention, the goal is not just to occupy/conquer the opposite country. The goal is also to do so at minimal loss to ourselves. So &quot;winning&quot; in the game of war &quot;is to conquer enemy country at minimal losses or maintain status quo if the losses would be substantial/irrecoverable&quot;. So you are always playing to &#x27;win&#x27;.",1401231802

7807427,comment,7807017,7807368,3,0,JoshTriplett,,,"That&#x27;s exactly what it means.  Most courts tend to make the narrowest possible ruling rather than setting broad precedent: if they can throw out a case on a technicality, they&#x27;ll do that rather than rule on the merits of the case itself.  When that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> happen, people start throwing around phrases like &quot;activist judges&quot;.<p>So, in the areas of copyright and patent trolls, it&#x27;s nice to see victories, but it&#x27;s nicer to see victories on the merits of the case rather than on the details a particular troll got wrong.",1401231748

(I&#x27;m not a lawyer and expect to be corrected here).<p>First, the Appeals court ruled that Prenda/AF&#x27;s attempt to compel service providers to cough up records created an undue burden on the providers. That burden was undue because in attempting to do that, Prenda/AF needed to demonstrate a good-faith belief that the records they were speaking were discoverable.<p>The DC circuit points out that it would have been possible to file such a suit and make such a demonstration, but, of course, Prenda/AF did not do that.<p>Second, the court ruled that Prenda/AF&#x27;s attempt at joining all their 1000+ suits into a single case was invalid, because Prenda/AF didn&#x27;t demonstrate in a meaningful way that the cases were related. Again, the court explained that there was a reasonable way Prenda/AF could have legitimately filed such a case (albeit with fewer defendants), but the slapdash way they actually filed the case made it easy to reject their joinder request.<p>To the extent that the details of this ruling pertain to the specifics of the Prenda/AF case, they are less useful, because you&#x27;d have to imagine after reading more about Prenda/AF that any copyright troll in the world would have to be smarter than them.",1401231728

My wife's sister got her first laptop with Ubuntu installed and after 3 years she can't stand windows/osx and I can't blame her: Gnome 2.3 is years ahead of both of them but it's only apparent to someone who's familiar with it. If you listen to hear arguments, you'll be amazed of how much of your perception of ""good UX"" is just a series of habits.<p>The roadblock to user adoption isn't the quality of software/ux, it's making people to make an effort and learn something new. Another issue is hardware quality. Trying out Linux on cheap and flimsy netbooks isn't the best way to experience new software.<p>In other words there nothing to be done with Ubuntu itself to reach his goals.

The problem with e-cash viz. keeping it free of gov't interference isn't actually with the transmission from one party to another of the e-currency. I can open a server in Greenland that tracks currency transactions in Uruguay for dope, and vice-versa, in my own encrypted and secure currency. The problem is how does anyone change in my funny money for a currency that they can actually spend somewhere. And Bitcoin doesn't solve that problem; it just complicates it. Btc leaves it up to the coin holder to figure out how to actually extract value from the bits, and assumes a market will develop. But how will a market develop when the inputs and outputs are all regulated by the same gov'ts that BC wants to do an end-run around?",1304971033

Intel also ""innovates along multiple points"" ""through microarchitecture and systemonchip design"". Additionally, they also have the world's best process technology. They certainly publish about more interesting micro-architectural innovations, and I'd argue that their chips are more 'interesting' on a micro-architectural level. They're obviously behind on the SoC side, because SoCs haven't been a focus for them, but it's conceivable that they could produce better SoCs than ARM implementers do, if they put their mind to it. However, it's inconceivable that anyone on the planet will have a better process in the foreseeable future.<p>The press release talks about working with IBM, but that's not very reassuring. I remember looking at IBM's process parameters and specs a few years ago, when they had press releases crowing about SOI, and Intel's nth generation bulk process was nearly as good as IBM's n+1 generation SOI process (and no doubt much cheaper, since it didnt have to deal with all of the complexities of SOI), and Intel was about half a process generation ahead at the time. I'm not a fab guy, so I don't keep up on this stuff, but I hear Intel's now more than a full generation ahead, and that their advantage within a generation is larger than ever.",1304970638

Its going to make it easier to build innovative user interfaces and I fully believe you will still be able to build apps that look and feel just like the traditional QWidget based interfaces we have today.  You can see this in some of the examples posted on the Qt Developer blog.<p>I lead the frontend development for a very large (and successful regardless of what the press says) command and control system.  We completely decoupled our UI from our logic years ago into config files, and use QtScript for GUI events.  This allows us to deploy on a large number of form factors with a single code base.  Performance has not been effected as the logic is still C++.  QML will be a huge improvement over that because it makes it so we don't have to manually build effects using QPainter, QGLWidget, or QGraphicsView.<p>I understand being resistant to change, but I am 100% behind them looking forward, building for the future, and not just assuming we will to continue doing things the way we do now.",1304969939

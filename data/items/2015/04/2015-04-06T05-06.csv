Mega or WhatsApp Web) launches without support for Firefox at day one, because ignoring Firefox is the way Mozilla will eventually stop their obstinacy.<p>But other part of me gets sad, because Firefox is the only feasible alternative the web has against webkit/blink, and the web can&#x27;t afford to have a weak alternative against a monoculture.<p>I can only hope IE/Spartan to become a feasible alternative, because I can&#x27;t expect Mozilla to stop their obstinacy until they have no choice.",1428299915

Most people have the &quot;how to&quot; knowledge of basic math in their heads. The imperative parts like the algorithm for dividing and multiplying numbers that they run on their wetware computer. The part concerned with reasoning about &quot;what is&quot;, the proofs part, the part mathematicians call &quot;math&quot; is not what most people&#x27;s knowledge of math consists of.<p>Imperative languages really are closer to how our minds work everyday. Yeah, on occasion we do some &quot;deep thinking&quot; about &quot;what is&quot; but most of the time our brain goes about things like &quot;ok, what are the steps to do X? [...] and now I&#x27;ll always label the result of the last step y [...] and when condition z happens I&#x27;ll goto step s etc.&quot;.<p>...this is how laws, regulations, institutional processes etc. are formulated. And this how <i>you see</i> nature work: that place on the tree branch where you saw a bird now holds nothing (... &#x27;null bird pointer&#x27; ?) or maybe you look around a few hours later after the storm and you see that branch is actually broken (... &#x27;segfault&#x27; ?).",1428299911

Also, I&#x27;m not sure what (specifically) read-line looks for to stop reading, but if it can occur randomly you could receive errors if this first random new-line occurs before the length of the file&#x27;s first line.

You&#x27;ll note that as individual expenses go down, group expenses should go down as well since employers will no longer have to cover their employees cost of living. Prices of everything will continue to plummet (as they have been). If anything, they should be able to do more on the same budget.<p>EDIT: You might think &quot;Well who&#x27;s paying for all those basics? Surely that will imply higher taxes.&quot;<p>Compare the cost of a 1GHz CPU today to the cost 10 years ago. The price went down and yet taxes did not play a significant role in that. The basics <i>could</i> be covered by taxes, but they need not be. The price of basics goes down over time naturally as technology advances and builds off of the knowledge and efficiencies of the technology before it. Taxes can be used to <i>accelerate</i> this process, but they are not necessary for it to happen in the first place. Free, clean drinking water was not even a thing a few centuries ago.

The alternative to ads <i>alongside</i> my content is ads <i>inside</i> my content.<p>Let&#x27;s face it: paywalls don&#x27;t work. The alternative on the horizon is native advertising. Buzzfeed is now famously refusing to host ads. Instead they sustain themselves by publishing content that subtly supports the agenda of any company with deep enough pockets to pay for it. A viewer&#x27;s ability to distinguish between native ads and regular articles is small and quickly vanishing. If separate ads stop reaching people, the path to monetization remaining is to change your content to reflect someone else&#x27;s agenda.<p>I keep AdBlock off by default because I prefer a world where creators can make a meaningful articles and a useful apps without caring about who they are supporting, and can, as the price tag, separately attach an ad.<p>I do see it as a moral issue. There are good people making content that&#x27;s being sustained by ads. I am never going to remember to give them my modicum of support if I don&#x27;t consider them innocent until proven guilty.

There is a lot of risk and ambiguity in lowball fixed bids that will cost you in the end. We all know that engineering estimates underestimate ... and that clients will always add/revise. So, why are you putting all of the risk on yourself for exactly what you would normally estimate? These situations are where freelancers get in big trouble with fixed-bid contracts.<p>On the other hand, suppose that your work is a huge value-add to the client. Suppose the client cares mostly about high quality, wants a good reliable consultant, and wants you. In this case, you can price your fixed bid in line with the value it will bring to the client. Meaning that now the risk is negligible -- even if your estimates are off and the client revises things, you will still be happy with the outcome. Now that you can relax, you can spend more time on delivering quality work and even give freebies if everything is on track!<p>Let me emphasize -- the only successful fixed price bids I&#x27;ve seen are where you know that even if everything goes wrong a developer still is happy with the outcome.

It should go away. Doing so will require a combination of technical and political restrictions on the way that advertisers do business. Solely one or the other will not be sufficient.<p>2. Advertising is and will remain the lifeblood of the Internet. The past is littered with the calcified husks of arguments claiming that subscription plans or microtransactions are capable replacements for advertising revenue. If a majority of users install ad blockers, society as a whole will suffer as content creators are squeezed out of the market. Whether or not this is a moral behavior is not the point -- users with ad blockers are game-theoretic parasites that feed off this weakness in the system. Societies have traditionally addressed such weaknesses by classifying such behavior as undesirable, shameful, or immoral. The movement to classify ad blockers in this category has already begun: in the future, either ad blockers will attain a majority or plurality install base among users or this movement towards demonizing ad-blocking users will intensify.",1428297056

They block BANNER ads.<p>If advertisers want to pitched their products, they should contract with websites for that website to display a relevant, clickable, ad hosted by the website.  Such schemes are no different than buying space to paint a poster on a stadium wall.  And as adblockers only target ads delivered by third parties, such displays will go untouched.<p>(Yes, i know adblock allows ad hoc image blocking, but the user will see the ad and must choose to block it every time it is updated.)<p>Advertisers than want to buy open-ended ad space on websites, that want to display different ads depending on who views the space, who want to track users to better target ads, who want to use &quot;ads&quot; as a Trojan horse for installing tracking cookies ... they can all rot alongside the good people from &quot;windows technical service department&quot; who called me at 4am this morning.",1428296517

9326645,comment,9326183,9326406,0,0,deciplex,,,"I&#x27;m more concerned with the anthropomorphism of an entire industry. This line of reasoning ignores the fact that The Ad Industry is not A Person With A Memory And Coherent History but rather just an almost-random sample of people with jobs. If the industry was immoral ten years ago, that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s immoral now, and it doesn&#x27;t mean that most of the people that make it up are immoral - then or now.<p>But, your counter-argument is not really a valid counter-argument, either. If we <i>act as though</i> the present incarnation of the ad industry is to be held responsible for its past actions, that will encourage moral behavior going forward and discourage hypocrisy. Of course, I&#x27;m still anthropomorphizing the ad industry here, and assuming that it&#x27;s even <i>capable</i> of &quot;learning a lesson&quot; might be assuming too much (for the record, I think it mostly is assuming too much). But I think that&#x27;s supposed to be the point - sort of. By anthropomorphizing a thing, we might force that thing to behave somewhat anthropomorphically. Or, we might not.<p>I think we&#x27;re all just trying to rationalize our behavior which is that we don&#x27;t like looking at ads, and we have the technical means to block ads, so we block ads. Anything more than that feels awfully post-hoc.<p>By blocking ads, you&#x27;re denying revenue to people whose content you wish to consume. There is no way around this fact. Maybe, by doing this, you will encourage forms of revenue generation that are less intrusive, or maybe you want to encourage a culture where revenue generation isn&#x27;t necessary, or any of a thousand other &#x27;reasons&#x27;. But, I think that if you tell yourself that this is the primary reason that you block ads, as opposed to &#x27;I find ads irritating and don&#x27;t wish to view them&#x27;, you should take special care to look <i>really hard</i> for some cognitive bias in your thinking, because you&#x27;ll almost certainly find some.",1428296484

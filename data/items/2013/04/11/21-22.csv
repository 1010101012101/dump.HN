I agree with the author of TFA about Google and their move away from the Open Web and towards another walled garden.  If I could subscribe to RSS feeds to populate my G+ streams, and post to G+ using AtomPub, and expose my social-graph from G+ using FOAF, consume G+ using RSS/Atom, etc., then I would have no problem with it.  But right now, Google seem determined to build something that's just one more walled garden, albeit one with a gate[1] that you can laboriously, manually, tediously drag your ""stuff"" out through.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.google.com/takeout"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/takeout</a>",1365717526

5535041,comment,5534882,5534882,14,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I feel the author's pain. I don't hold it against Google for looking at the way RSS is (was?) used and re-implementing it in a way that they can more easily make money off it, while simultaneously removing any traction they are offering for the old non monetizable way of doing things. They are a business after all and no amount of money in the bank is enough [1].<p>But I find the whining a bit distracting since the same thing that made RSS in the first place is still out there. There is no ""patent"" on aggregating RSS feeds or creating a more durable (and by that I mean self sustainable) service which has the same capability.<p>My advice is don't look at this as a loss, look at this as an opportunity. Rarely does the invading army come back to revisit the burned out village they have left behind. It is dead to them, so it is a uniquely safe place to avoid their future gaze.<p>[1] I asked Eric Schmidt at one of the TGIF (friday) meetings why taking the $30M/year they spent on bottled water and putting it into their bank account made sense. His answer was that there were a lot of unknowns facing Google and the only insurance they had for dealing with them was to  have a lot of capital. There is always something that <i>could</i> happen, that you might have prevented if you had just a bit more <i>money</i>. And sliding rapidly down that slope as early as 2007 (when I asked my question) it continues to be the goto answer to this day.",1365717455

The number we have in mind is higher than that, so I guess we actually are talking about paying more than minimum wage.

You are looking at what, $20 million of ASICs?  $30 million?  Let's be completely unrealistic and say $100 million.<p>That is less than a tenth of what the government spent on the NSA's new datacenter in Utah.  It's pocket change, barely even a blip on the budget of the US government.  It requires a very small commitment of personnel and no fieldwork at all, and no real agreement from any other countries.  If we called Bitcoin a money-laundering scam, if we attacked under the guise of evidence gathering (just reversing transactions so criminals won't get paid by our cops), I doubt many countries would object <i>even</i> if their citizens lost money in the process.<p>That is just with the <i>known, well-documented</i> polynomial time attack on Bitcoin.

But the end result of wealth getting sucked out of peoples' hands is the same.<p>* For the record, everything is intrinsically and inherently valueless. You can't use a microscope to examine any type of object and find a tiny particle called ""value"". All value people place on everything in an economy is subjective in nature, whether its gold or paper or corn or milk or iron or wood. Your argument here for gold being valueless doesn't make a point because that's inherent in anything and everything.<p>* That being said, gold has successfully been used as a currency throughout the planet's history. It was accepted worldwide with no barriers to its ability to trade throughout countries.<p>* The argument that people make against gold being suitable as a currency because of its lack of stability compared to paper is unbelievably laughable. What type of event is more likely: gold somehow losing its application in all kinds of industries/mass quantities of gold being suddenly discovered that alters its fundamental market value (events never before seen in human history) or somehow corrupt politicians and powerful people that manage these paper currencies manipulating the currency for their own benefit?<p>* That being said, regarding this larger argument about Bitcoin, these coins lack any practical value as far as I can see outside of perhaps anonymity. I say perhaps because Bitcoin isn't actually an anonymous currency, but all transactions can ultimately be traced in some fashion. So it remains to be seen if this  will work as a currency long-term.",1365715534

Family businesses, and businesses with close relations, have worked for centuries in other fields.<p>So why not in software/tech?<p>Of course if ""making it big by any means"" it's what motivates you, then don't do it.

According to the Bank for International Settlements,[3] as of April 2010, average daily turnover in global foreign exchange markets is estimated at $3.98 trillion, a growth of approximately 20% over the $3.21 trillion daily volume as of April 2007.

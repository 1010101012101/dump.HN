Since the name was trademarked, no one could sell a compiler without passing the suite. There was no way that two guys in a garage could sell a compliant compiler without getting it certified. But making a C/C++ compiler and selling it for $25, that happened. So the only compilers in the beginning were from big companies for big money.",1234241509

Perhaps if you take a step back, you will be able to imagine how your initial abrasive approach may invite uneasiness.<p>You seem to have decided, seemingly in retrospect, that the article was satire in its entirety. But, in the end I still walk away with the idea that you think people who disagree with mainstream ideas in economics are nutjobs. And, importantly, are in no way qualified to talk about them or think about them.<p><i>""I think you'd be hard pressed to actually make the case that my post represents an appeal to authority.""</i><p>Well, lets see if I'm up for the challenge.<p><i>""Fiat currency is superior to the gold standard. Bankers are not evil. The Federal Reserve does a half decent job. Money is not debt.  Debt isn’t even bad — the vast majority of it can be healthy. If you disagree with me, you are wrong, and a nutjob.""</i><p>Is this an ironic punch-line? Or part of a pattern of defending the status quo established earlier?<p><i>""All you have to do is bring up topics like fiat currency, the gold standard, money creation, the Federal Reserve and inflation. It’s like walking into a southern church and bringing up evolution. (It’s not often I get to compare you guys to creationists.)""</i><p>See, earlier, you cited the same series of questions and compared those who disagree with the mainstream to creationists. (I think this is an unfair comparison, but that  is another question entirely.) So, I think it that it is reasonable to interpret that as a component of your thesis.<p>Sandwiched in between these ideological statements are a few paragraphs about how the layman is not equipped to understand or discuss the ideas. This is what I read in telegraph form:<p>positions on economic theory STOP,\nyou are not equipped to disagree STOP,\ntherefore: positions of economic STOP.<p>Maybe you didn't mean to communicate this. But whatever your intention, I think you did end up saying it.<p>But, now, I realize I really have no idea what you actually meant. Maybe I am too foolish to understand; maybe your writing is imperfect. Oh well, I think we are all likely to survive to see tomorrow.<p><i></i>*<p>I feel pretty silly writing all of this nonsense without even mentioning economics. Is it reasonable to question whether mainstream economic hypotheses are valid?<p>I think so.<p>Firstly, professional economists disagree about everything you mentioned (especially the role of the Federal reserve and the wisdom of a fiat currency).<p>Secondly, consider the practitioners, who are under much more pressure to <i>get it right</i> than academics because the practitioners are subjected to real feedback. The practitioners are forced to discard poor ideas and routinely reject many mainstream academic hypotheses (like the efficient market hypothesis and the sanity of the Fed's inflationary bender).<p>Finally, these practitioners are frequently laymen. So, maybe there is hope for us. Maybe we can learn something by talking.<p>I think we can all learn a lot by talking more: nutjobs and all.",1234238753

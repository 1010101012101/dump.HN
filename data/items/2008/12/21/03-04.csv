At that point, is it health insurance?<p>Finally, going for preventative care saves more money than it costs for a provider. Having someone see a high cholesterol number and adjust diet and such is much cheaper than a heart attack a few years down the road.

While I do find pure philosophy to often be garbage (most metaphysics, ethics, and epistemology), I think one of its most important contributions is in multi-disciplinary pursuits and its concern with foundational matters.  Not to mention that so much of modern, theoretical computer science (particularly logic and type theory) have its origins in the works of philosophers.",1229829530

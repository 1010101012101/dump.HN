The things that determine the price of wine are mostly the brand of the wine itself and the brand of the region it comes from. Taste plays only a very small role in pricing. And the alcohol content actually significantly effects how people perceive the taste, because when people are tasting a dozen plus wines in a sitting they tend to prefer the ones with higher alcohol content because they stand out more as they lose their taste perception, even if these wines wouldn't be that good on their own.",1328457115

3554293,comment,3552363,3553430,15,0,sunahsuh,,,"> the insidious thing about alcohol is that it clouds your judgement and makes abuse more likely. So you've had a few drinks and you're having fun, hanging out with friends, feeling pretty good. And then everyone is ordering another round, which is almost certainly a bad idea from a logical perspective. But you're not thinking logically anymore, so you do too.<p>...or you can hang out with friends who drink like responsible adults (and not like overgrown frat kids.) Excessive drinking isn't a result of alcohol consumption as much as the drinking culture in the US. We have this notion that ""when people drink they act like idiots with clouded judgement,"" which becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. In other countries where attitudes toward alcohol are different there's a marked difference in how people behave under the influence. Now, while you can't do a ton about the way US culture as a whole views alcohol consumption, you <i>can</i> make it a point to socialize with people who know how to have a good time while drinking in moderation (or influence your friends to be more responsible in the way they drink.)<p>(More about how behavior under the influence is actually determined by our social expectations and not a characteristic of alcohol itself: <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15265317"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15265317</a> For instance, ""This basic fact has been proved time and again, not just in qualitative cross-cultural research, but also in carefully controlled scientific experiments - double-blind, placebos and all. To put it very simply, the experiments show that when people think they are drinking alcohol, they behave according to their cultural beliefs about the behavioural effects of alcohol."")",1328456637

Facebook has been very careful not to make solid promises about what they'll do with the data, though. That doesn't prove they do other things with it, but they at least seem to want to keep their options open. There are all sorts of interesting services they could run that I think people would find much more objectionable uses of their data; and it's not clear they would announce it if they started doing so.<p>It's likely they already give the government more data than strictly required; they've danced around the issue when asked if they voluntarily give data to the government, in circumstances that don't require them to do so (i.e. no subpoena, warrant, or other legal order). They could choose to do that with non-governmental entities too; for example, it might be lucrative to start an employee-screening service. Some of that could be risky PR-wise, but they need not publicly disclose it, and might choose to strike private deals with a few large companies for use of the data. They could even get some plausible deniability by doing it via an intermediary: Facebook licenses a data feed to a third party for analytics purposes, and the third party sells curated views on it to interested parties.<p>Not sure if any of that will happen, but there doesn't seem to be much stopping it.

I don't buy games with obnoxious copy protection/anti-cheating mechanisms, for example (and I don't pirate them either). I don't buy a huge amount of music/video either, but I actively favour unrestricted formats when I do.<p>I think it's different when you're talking about permanent content someone is ""buying"" vs. temporary content someone is only paying to access as pay-per-view/rental/all-you-can-eat subscription, though. In the latter case, the pricing model is going to be set at a level commensurate with the usage model.<p>That can be a good thing, if it means more people get to enjoy more content than they otherwise would. For example, maybe someone who only tends to watch films once would not want to pay full price to buy every DVD but would be happy to have a flat-rate monthly subscription to an on-line streaming service. They can only do that if someone manages to run a viable flat-rate monthly subscription service, and if there's no enforcement, it could become a one-sided deal where the consumer takes full access but only pays the restricted access price.<p>This might not be a problem if the users in your market are basically honest, decent people and you can still make a reasonable profit while overlooking the occasional indiscretion. This is the outcome I'm kind of hoping for personally for our own business.<p>On the other hand, it's a big risk to take in a world where right now piracy is rampant and much of it is casual copying. I suspect that over time, as the first generation who have had always-on everything for their entire lives grow up, we are going to see quite a few cultural changes in terms of how we use the Internet. I think one of the changes will be in our attitude to sharing and the business models we use to produce and distribute content: a lot of things are already moving to supply content as part of a flat-rate, all-you-can-eat service rather than a series of one-off purchased products. Again, that might be no bad thing for either the producers or the consumers in the long run, but until that becomes a social norm, assuming it does, I can certainly understand businesses that want to make sure both sides are keeping up their end of the deal.",1328455124

So only thing we can do is start a 'closed off' site which connects people interested in this, so we can coordinate buying of DVDs for 'personal' use from studio's (as I said before, I tried that in NL, BE and FR and they are willing to accomodate for high prices) and then copy them for interested parties. Yes, i'm advocating copying here, but how else to force them to digitize them? What can be done?<p>On a slightly related topic; HN (and Reddit) is FULL with domain experts; where are the people who work at these studios and television makers? Do they actually ever come here? Why don't they chime in ever? I would love to have a discussion with people working in the industry. They seem to be so focused on money that they don't want to hear reason, so I would definitely like to know if all management thinks like that for instance.<p>And slightly related to that last part:<p>In the Netherlands we have this idiot who is the ceo of Brein which is the Dutch anti piracy organisation; he sometimes does some comments or interviews, but he just quits after he is torpedoed down as the guy knows nothing.

3554180,comment,3553530,3554055,1,0,Chris_Newton,,,"1. Please note that I'm not suggesting that serving DRM-free content <i>can't</i> make a decent profit. Personally, I really hope it would for us as well and that we will be able to do exactly that. But I have to separate my desire to run that kind of company from the commercial reality that in contrast to the humble bundles and Louis CK, we are highly unlikely to wind up with vast amounts of Internet coverage on high volume web sites that reach a lot of our target audience who are likely to look upon us favourably precisely because we are making a point of not using DRM.<p>2. If you've got any serious data to share on this point, I'd appreciate links. I've been researching the real effects of copyright, infringement, DRM, etc. for a long time, and I've found few studies with anything resembling a sound methodology and unbiased reporting, and even fewer that consider anything but mass-market Big Media operations.<p>3. I'm not sure this is a good place to enumerate every likely browser bug we're currently tracking, but I'll give a few examples:<p>- Some browsers are not detecting the end of a video properly (no JS event fires/can't replay -- not really much doubt that this is a bug).<p>- Some smartphones play videos fullscreen whether you like it or not (unhelpful if there are other controls beyond the universal video ones that users should be able to reach with one touch -- this is an active choice, but limits the quality of the experience we can offer to users).<p>- Several mobile devices reportedly support H.264 at a certain profile and level, but in practice seem to require more specific settings (which don't always seem to be clearly documented in the guidelines published by the browser/OS developers -- this may or may not be down to bugs, but without clear specs and completely standardised formats it's in any case a significant drain on resources just investigating and testing across a wide field of devices).<p>I'm not referring to DRM at all here, just the problems of using HTML5 technology that isn't sufficiently standardised yet relative to the one-size-fits-all-except-iOS of Flash.<p>4. In our tests, H.264 in an MP4 file (using the features that are supported in browsers) gets modestly better quality at a given bit rate than a WebM stack and completely outclasses Ogg/Theora/Vorbis. If you have a browser like Firefox that for cultural/legal/whatever reasons won't support H.264, then the best result is that Firefox users will see lower-quality video or need more bandwidth to see the same quality. There's not really anything ambiguous about this.<p>As for DRM, if it ever interferes noticeably with legitimate users, that's obviously a bad thing. Again, my personal line is that any technology we do decide to use to protect our content in any way should be transparent to someone using our service legitimately. But if we're talking about someone visiting a web page to watch a video, why does the user care what technology is being used to achieve that as long as it looks and sounds as it should? If in some alternate reality I could use a plug-in on iOS smartphones to provide a better user interface instead of relying on Apple's compulsory full-screen presentation, or if we decided to produce an iPhone app for the same reason, would you still object to requiring 3rd party software so a customer could use our service more easily?<p>> But at the same time, the arguments for DRM aren't strong either.<p>The argument for some form of transparent DRM in our internal discussions is simple and compelling: either it works and we potentially make more sales to legal customers at the expense of pirates, or it doesn't work and we're probably no worse off than we would have been anyway. Unless either the implementation costs are high or we're at risk of losing significant numbers of legitimate customers for some reason, it's essentially a plan with no drawbacks other than the bad taste it leaves in the mouth.<p>Once again, I feel I should stress that I'm writing personally here and not in any official capacity. I should also be clear that I am playing devil's advocate to some extent, as are other people when we debate this in-house. No-one is evangelising DRM here, we're just not buying the anti-DRM arguments without reading the full brochure either.<p>> The only argument in favor of DRM that I can get behind is: ""It's my content, I can do what I want with it.""<p>Well, yes, and to the extent that ""I can do what I want with it"" means ""I can run a viable business that helps my paying customers"" and ""People who don't pay us for it don't get to have it"" I don't think anyone here has much of a problem with that.<p>If genuine users have even the slightest problem because of any technological content protection measures, that's a serious issue for me.<p>If it costs us a lot of time and/or money to implement those measures and they don't generate a worthwhile return, that's also a serious issue.<p>However, being nice to people who are blatantly trying to rip us off rather than paying a price that, frankly, almost anyone in our target market can easily afford is... not a priority, let's say.",1328454167

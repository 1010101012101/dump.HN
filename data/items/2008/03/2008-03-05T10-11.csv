I've taken a job as a developer for a start-up in Waltham after college ... but i don't think i'm going to be happy in the long run ... Then it occurred to me that since i've been going to business school and programming, i've practically lost all touch with my artistic side (I used to paint, draw, act, etc..) and that I really regret it ...""</i><p>make things that artists like :)<p>The trick is don't think and/or. There are factors that will work against you though. I noticed after switching from the visual side of my brain used in fine-arts to the predominantly textual side used in programming, it pretty much killed my drawing instinct. The instictive need to draw and scribble. I've only just lately tried to balance the two. Not easy since each require different ways of thinking & looking at things.",1204714594

Based on my off the cuff calculations, I think a person with a decent programming job could save enough in 5 or so years (with frugal living) that they could live overseas off the interest.  If true, this is much more guaranteed path to financial freedom than a startup.  Just an option to consider.<p>This is what I've found so far along with the mentioned calculations:

129609,comment,129517,129563,0,0,trevelyan,,,"> make it my primary passion in life<p>In my experience, if you already had a primary passion you wouldn't care if it offered a ""career path"". At a minimum you'd be trying to reconcile it with a ""real job"" and would eventually stumble onto a crossroads.<p>If you're just unhappy tro to desocialize. Change your environment, your media and your perspective. At an extreme you could move to another country and try learning the language while getting by. Switching cities or jobs is also good, as is picking up a new hobby and meeting new people.<p>Do your best to kill the expectations that other people place on you and live for yourself.",1204712901

Break down the big, intractable life problem into the smallest questions that you can, and answer each question as honestly as you can:<p>Do you want to be ""creative""?  What does that mean to you?<p>Do you need to be an actor/dancer/singer/whatever to be creative?  Why?<p>Do you like programming?  When?<p>Do you like where you currently work?  When?<p>If you were unsuccessful as an actor/dancer/singer/whatever, would you be happy?  Why?<p>If you were in your ideal programming job, would you be happy?  Why?<p>etc.<p>If you do this carefully, you might be surprised by what you find.  Not all of our needs are self-consistent or rational.",1204712485

There was an article in the New Scientist about the WBE equation ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_theory_of_ecology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_theory_of_ecology</a> ). Essentially, increased energy consumption increases lifespan and delays lifestyle choices but doesn't increase fertility. An example is that the birth rate of industrialised countries is vastly lower than unindustrialised countries. In North America, it has reached a situation where the population doesn't sustain itself. In parts of Europe where the population is not sustaining, some governments offer financial incentives in a futile attempt to fix the situation.<p>Shell geologist, M King Hubbert's originial 1956 paper on peak oil ( <a href=""http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf</a> ) foresaw a bootstrap from fossil fuel to uranium reactors to thorium breeder reactors.

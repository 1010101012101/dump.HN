Then the upgrade did not really help with the return and I decided to downgrade back to the standard personal level...but..oh no...I could not downgrade at all..WTF...and their site says once you upgrade you cannot downgrade...that's a boat load of whatever...but I would never imagine LinkedIn doing something similar...the error is probably temporary..",1213750593

Hence, the basic agreement. Was going to elaborate more later (i.e. now) but now don’t think it’s needed as points have been made by others since.<p>...also, in the same vein one can ask what your comment accomplishes that a downmod would't have? :)",1213750578
220393,comment,220165,220165,0,0,makecheck,,,"There is another reason to avoid the defaulting trap that is the subject of the article: you don't want something evaluated if it will never be used.<p>Python <i>always</i> evaluates the default values of arguments; this is done at parsing time.  So if you define a function f(a=x()) and never call f(), there will still be a call to x().<p>The first work-around mentioned in the article (to assign None as a value, and test for None before setting a default), is the approach that I prefer when the default value is non-trivial.",1213750464

220380,comment,220267,220312,0,0,derefr,,,"People only want to learn one thing. If there's a default way, and an optional way, most people will use the default, so you'll be able to expect it and learn it. If, however, everyone is forced to choose at the beginning (without a default), there will be a pretty even distribution of people with and without the feature enabled. In a case where this severely affects the usability of the browser for those who aren't used to it (e.g. those who expect to be able to use the beginnings of URLs in the smart bar and can't, and, vice versa, those who expect to use keywords in the ""old bar"" and can't), this causes problems.<p>For example, say you wanted to set up computers for public use at a school or library. Which way is it better to set the option? If it were a default/option pair, it would obviously be better to set it to the default, since people would be more familiar with it. If, however, it were just two equally valid options, which one would people be more likely to be familiar with? Multiply this by every possible [add-on on/add-on off] pair, and you have, perhaps, 1000 or more default browser configurations, any of which are equally likely to run into in the wild!<p>Anyway, on your first point, I think <i>users</i> need to be a little more sensitive to the fact that, if they don't allow themselves to be pushed out of their comfort zone every once in a while, their experience using their software (or anything for that matter) will never improve. If a feature worked crappily, one would never know it until they adapt to the ""new way"" enough to see how bad it was before. Until then, their comfort with the old way makes them much too partial to be a good judge.",1213749106

I've been using the betas (and nightly builds) for quite some time, and it's stopped getting in my way. I do believe that the default behaviors were not thought through very well (strings at the beginning of a url should have higher precedence than page titles), it does take up too much space, and it takes too long to show up.

It irritated me at first, as any fairly major feature change would, but it is pretty awesome and useful.<p>When I find that I visit a site so often that I habitually key in the first few characters, hit down, and hit enter, it is time to bookmark it and give it a keyword (in a bookmark's properties).

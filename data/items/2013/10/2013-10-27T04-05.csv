What I described should be obvious.<p>Eventually, all cars will be driver-less, and the &quot;old style&quot; of car will be rare to see on the road. Like pre-1974 cars are extremely rare to see now. Everyone will want the newer, safer, cooler, energy efficient cars that drive you home safely, even when you&#x27;re high.<p>&quot;You&#x27;re high. It&#x27;s not going to happen.&quot;<p>Yes, I&#x27;m high. But it will happen. The bicycle situation you describe is one where the computer could still take action to minimize injury to the cyclist, and reduce the risk of causing a major accident with other vehicles. Most drivers would panic and &quot;swerve into the next lane&quot; as you describe, which is not the best action to take. It&#x27;s about controlled evasive action, not &quot;holy crap... slam on brakes...over-steer... enter skid... over-compensate over-steering... enter another skid... crash.&quot;<p>If the cyclist collides with your car because of cyclist error, then what you have firstly is an extremely unlikely situation, as cyclists are usually focused on what they are doing. They&#x27;re not adjusting the air-con, or thinking about sex while riding through traffic - they are concentrating.<p>&quot;You still have to account for cyclists, pedestrians, animals...&quot;.<p>Come on bolder88, get real. Driver training teaches us to avoid swerving into the path of oncoming vehicles to avoid impact with wildlife. The computer would not allow you to do so, and that&#x27;s how it should be. However, the computer WOULD allow you to swerve into the other lane if there was no oncoming traffic. Otherwise, the safest option is to run over the animal.<p>With pedestrians, it&#x27;s certainly a challenging scenario for the driver-less car, but I still think that the automatic hazard avoidance systems can save the day better than manual intervention. That&#x27;s because it takes great skill to control a car in an emergency situation. Most drivers don&#x27;t know how to control a skid, because most drivers don&#x27;t get any practice with such driving.<p>Perhaps then, to meet you half way, some drivers can apply for a special license that gives them full control. For the rest of us, the computer is the safer option for controlling the vehicle during an evasive maneuver.",1382849982

Our goal is to help people form better opinions by providing easy access to the ideas in the first place alongside tools for assessing credibility. Our focus is very much on opinion, not news.<p>It&#x27;s cool because I think it&#x27;s an interesting and difficult problem and I don&#x27;t know of anyone tackling it well. I still don&#x27;t know how feasible it is to create an automated / crowd driven system that provides a measure of credibility that is reliable enough to be useful, but we are certainly giving it our best shot and I would love to use such a tool if it existed.<p>I also think it&#x27;s cool because I think both our user credibility system and topic hierarchy concepts have aspects that are quite nice that I haven&#x27;t seen elsewhere.<p>We are currently focused on finance because it is clear how to score predictions about things that trade in a market (though the problem is much trickier than you might first imagine).

More theory than practise when you should probably seek theory when you&#x27;re confronted to a problem that needs it.<p>2. You really don&#x27;t need to know about automata theory, linear algebra or whatever to be a good developer. Brings me back to what I said in 1.<p>3. Actually the paper doesn&#x27;t depicts the reality clearly: you have a lot of teacher assistant always available to help you, it&#x27;s just that they are not allowed to gives you the answer, only to help you search in the right direction. When you encounter something tricky where finding documentation on the internet becomes an issue then you can talk about it with them. The system works quite well in Epitech. I have been a C & C++ assistant there and the level amongst the assistants is really good, and you could never hire the same number of qualified teachers (if you could find them). Having people that worked on the same project themselves quite recently (like 1 or 2 years ago) makes it that you will always find someone who knows what he is talking about.<p>To teach CS this is really the best system I have seen so far, and it teach you to never get stuck, never trust blindly what someone says, and always go find the answers by yourself.",1382846724

However, if there&#x27;s even a hint of a protest, out come the censors and posts get deleted rapidly.<p>They&#x27;ve gone so far as to ban Weibo accounts with influential amounts of followers.<p>When I read that US law enforcement is working with Facebook to mitigate protests, it seems like they&#x27;re playing catchup using tactics not dissimilar to China. This is incredibly concerning given the importance of protests in a Democracy.",1382846532

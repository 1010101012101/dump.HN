When you have an old model, it's come about due to whatever the situation in the industry was like at the time, and it's evolved due to past forces acting on the old model. To take a basic idea that seems figured out and ""fine"" (education, or a car) and get rid of any preexisting notions or ideas of how it should work, and start from first principles and think from the very start how it should be given modern advancements, is a difficult and powerful thing.",1368151183

A good thing? It would be, if everyone could participate. Right now, though, that's not the case.<p>I have no problem with those who were alive during that time keeping rent-control. However, I do have a problem with it when people making $250,000 per year get in on RC because they have connections and pay key money to the children of the deceased. That I have a problem with.

Both sides can't both be right, even though a comment would in isolation be more than enough to convince someone who was not skeptical.

I'm going to presume that there's nothing particularly special about healthcare and we can apply this kind of binary logic to everything? Why regulate safe drinking water? Why regulate car safety standards? Why regulate food safety? Why regulate really anything at all since by your logic, we can't make it perfect so to hell with all that.

If you watch it, it will get worse at some times of the day rather than others. If inversions happen, you'll also see some beam bending that can cause you to pick up powerlines/roads, etc. You can verify it is mostly bugs by looking at the differential reflectivity. The differential reflectivity(difference of horizontal and vertical returned powers) will be somewhat random for ground clutter, and higher values for bugs.<p>With this approach, without knowing exactly how you do it, I'd be worried that it would have the tendency to filter out initial formations of stratiform clouds, and just leave convective formations. \nI can point you to some theory on how a lot of the filtering is done for research in atmos if you'd like, feel free to message me(I'm working on my Ph.D. in weather radar).",1368149603

I spent $100 and received 109 clicks for that money (CTR 0.008%). Those 109 clicks resulted in 13 completed surveys, so a conversion of 12%. The frequency was 7.0 with a reach of 207840.<p>To be honest I was really disappointed. I expected a higher CTR (more like 0.01 or 0.02%) and a lower cost/click. It cost me nearly $1/click while I counted on $0.25~0.50/click.<p>I'm planning to use Facebook advertising again though, the geographic targeting is pretty good. Looking for some tips. Should I go for a higher frequency (Seth Godin says that frequency > reach in his book Permission Marketing)?",1368148398

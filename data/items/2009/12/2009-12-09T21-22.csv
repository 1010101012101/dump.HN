What does that even mean? Tens of thousands of real-life strangers see your face, your children, your address every year. If I wanted to stalk a random person all day every day in real life, how much information could I gather? Who would find out?<p>For some reason it's scary to use Gmail, but it's fine to walk into your bank and hand over your entire financial history to a complete stranger. People fear the internet because they fear the unknown. Call me crazy, why don't we focus on actual issues instead? While you are wasting time complaining that Google ""has your data"", people are dying of heart diseases, hunger, AIDS, cancer, bad emo music, McDonald's, and car crashes, okay? People got real problems.<p>On the more practical side, I would argue that the real problem is not one of privacy, but one of security and common sense. Would you leave a diary of your secret thoughts sitting on your coffee table? Would you let a stranger store it for? Probably not. Then why would you put your private information on Google Docs or Facebook or your blog?<p>P.S. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems the author actually argues that Google <i>owes</i> people something, besides great service. And for no other reason than to tip the balance of power away from itself, otherwise it's ""evil"". What?",1260395789

The lack of concern for your fellow man is disconcerting at best - and based on people I've talked to here in the US people generally don't feel that <i>other</i> people being sick and dying will negatively affect them.<p>IMHO this is the big difference: in socialized medicine countries we acknowledge that when a large swathe of the population goes without basic medical care, we all lose - lost productivity, general misery, etc. There's at least the general notion of paying up ""for the greater good"".<p>In America I get the feeling it's more treated as ""meh, maybe you should work harder"".

I am not an expert on the topic, but it seems to me that an asymptomatic HSV carrier cannot infect anyone and, thus, there's no health problem, and no negative effect on one's life.<p>Yes, it's possible to have many sexual partners and be healthy. One only needs to compare the rates of HSV and other STD's in Sweden (where sex education is serious) to places like rural U.S. (where religion, not common sense, dominates).<p>Yes, there's a stigma associated with HSV and other similar virus. Epstein-Barr causes mononucleosis, but there's less stigma associated with it, perhaps because it's the ""kiss disease"", and kissing is apparently more innocent than fornication. On the other hand, I think stigmas are there for a reason. A legacy of a not so distant past where STD's where non-curable and non-treatable. Promiscuity is a moral issue, so I won't discuss it. I think one's sex life is better without any haunting STD's, and that's why I think it's not responsible to say that herpes is totally kosher. If one catches it, it's not the end of the world, but it's not a pleasant experience either.",1260395671

Lately, I have spent 5 to 10 hours a week doing setup/experiments on EC2 + EBS (about half on customer projects, and about half for my own stuff). I expect (hope!) that this time spent per week will decrease drastically since although I have been having a lot of fun, this is time spent not doing development.<p>I continue to be a big fan of Heroku because it saves me so much time, but I have been having limited success getting customers to go with Heroku - they seem to want to pay for custom EC2 setups.<p>BTW, one huge advantage of running on EC2 is that it is so easy to run an old version of a system to test against. I moved my own reserved instance from booting on an ephemeral drive (out of S3) to booting off of EBS. I only deployed what I currently need, and will always have the old version around to test against, check a bootup script, etc.",1260395429

986675,comment,986422,986542,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"I'm not disagreeing with you. But I want to point out one thing. Here is an excerpt of a letter from the founders that is part of their IPO filing to the SEC. It clearly implies that the Google co-founders envision their company having morals. They assert that their company will do ""good things for the world"" and hope that the company itself ""makes the world a better place"".<p>At the time this letter was released, the Wall Street crowd called BS. I remember the uproar. I was hoping that Google would usher in a different era of corporate governance; one in which corporate balance sheets don't have tunnel vision towards ""the bottom line"" but take into account the bigger picture. I was wrong. Yesterday I started procuring servers in order to host a lot of the services that Google provides for me like email. It might not mean much but it's my own little way of protesting what I believe to be pure hypocrisy coming from Google.<p>Taken from: <a href=""http://www.secinfo.com/d14D5a.148c8.htm#645a"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.secinfo.com/d14D5a.148c8.htm#645a</a><p><i>DON’T BE EVIL<p>Don’t be evil. We believe strongly that in the long term, we will be better served—as shareholders and in all other ways—by a company that does good things for the world even if we forgo some short term gains. This is an important aspect of our culture and is broadly shared within the company.<p>Google users trust our systems to help them with important decisions: medical, financial and many others. Our search results are the best we know how to produce. They are unbiased and objective, and we do not accept payment for them or for inclusion or more frequent updating. We also display advertising, which we work hard to make relevant, and we label it clearly. This is similar to a well-run newspaper, where the advertisements are clear and the articles are not influenced by the advertisers’ payments. We believe it is important for everyone to have access to the best information and research, not only to the information people pay for you to see.<p>MAKING THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE<p>We aspire to make Google an institution that makes the world a better place. In pursuing this goal, we will always be mindful of our responsibilities to our shareholders, employees, customers and business partners. With our products, Google connects people and information all around the world for free. We are adding other powerful services such as Gmail, which provides an efficient one gigabyte Gmail account for free. We know that some people have raised privacy concerns, primarily over Gmail’s targeted ads, which could lead to negative perceptions about Google. However, we believe Gmail protects a user’s privacy. By releasing services, such as Gmail, for free, we hope to help bridge the digital divide. AdWords connects users and advertisers efficiently, helping both. AdSense helps fund a huge variety of online web sites and enables authors who could not otherwise publish. Last year we created Google Grants—a growing program in which hundreds of non-profits addressing issues, including the environment, poverty and human rights, receive free advertising. And now, we are in the process of establishing the Google Foundation. We intend to contribute significant resources to the foundation, including employee time and approximately 1% of Google’s equity and profits in some form. We hope someday this institution may eclipse Google itself in terms of overall world impact by ambitiously applying innovation and significant resources to the largest of the world’s problems.</i>",1260395327

Yes, when you choose to drink Coca-Cola you've chosen a set of people who can potentially adulterate your food; that's a fair analogy.<p>Those reminders alone aren't anything profound, except to emphasize: pay attention to the values and incentives of those you delegate these powers.  Google occasionally seems casual or dismissive about privacy concerns, as with Schmidt's recent statement. Until something blows up on them, they actually make more money (and more friends in government) by being lax about privacy protections.",1260395273

Certainly anything where you are wanting to do analysis in the DB doesn't work very well.<p>In your particular case I guess you'd have to do two queries.  One to grab the users in the range you have, then another to grab the interests for that range.  One interesting bit is that you could fire those off in // if you so wished, then do the merge.<p>As I said earlier, it does kind of require you to really think through your access patterns ahead of time before going the NoSQL route.  And at least in SimpleDB there is no doubt not being able to query across 'tables' can be a big letdown.  But really it is those kinds of queries that eventually turn into problems, so to some extent it just forces you to think of the right way of doing things first.

986654,comment,986568,986568,0,0,tokenadult,,,"""The largest number of overseas Chinese, most of whom were refugees from China, resided in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and China’s first lesson in global exchange was from nearby Hong Kong. Before communist rule, the inhabitants of the capital of Guangdong (adjacent to Hong Kong), were considered city slickers, while Hong Kong was full of country bumpkins. As Hong Kong surged, several million Guangdongese escaped to Hong Kong, where they participated in its economic miracle. Friends and families lined up in long queues in Guangzhou to receive hand-me-downs from their Hong Kong friends and relatives. Young urban women wanted to marry only men with overseas family relations.15 When the Chinese government first set up Special Economic Zones in Shenzhen (near Hong Kong), Zhuhai (near Macau), Shantou (the hometown of Hong Kong refugees), and Xiemen (near Taiwan), the Chinese borrowed their new rules and regulations directly from Hong Kong. Guangdong entrepreneurs copied the Hong Kong model of 'Front Shop, Back Factory,' while others set up joint factories together with Hong Kong small business owners.""<p>I watched this process occurring in the 1980s, with the later participation of business persons from Taiwan (noted later in the submitted article). Having a culturally similar alternative model (Hong Kong and Taiwan with different political rules and different economic structures) was crucial in helping China make a smoother transition to sound rather than irrational economic policies than Russia has been able to achieve thus far.",1260394873

986582,comment,986356,986356,0,0,grellas,,,"Science and advocacy is an interesting topic.<p>As a lawyer, I have witnessed the phenomenon of the ""hired gun"" very often in a courtroom context. A ""neutral,"" ""objective"" expert comes to the very conclusion for which he or she is paid and dresses it up with all the right-sounding phrases and data to support the desired conclusion. Does this mean every court expert is a mere hack? No, not at all. There are honest experts. But you have to fight your way through all the others (and there are many of them) to find the occasional expert with sufficient integrity to withstand the temptation to twist results to suit a pre-conceived goal sought by the party paying for the services.<p>Fast forward to private industry scientists. Many of us are quick to disparage scientific statements made by ""paid lackeys"" of, say, the oil industry. We simply assume that such results are tainted. Why? Because we automatically associate the scientists involved with the party paying the bills and take it as a given that anyone in that role will not be truly objective and will likely be a paid hack. Thus, the environment from which the scientific statements emanate determines for us whether to believe the statements or regard them as tainted. In a private industry context, we have a strong predisposition to assign taint to the outcome.<p>Now, if human nature is such that it can be ""bought"" in a courtroom context or in a private-industry context, why should it magically transform itself in a public policy context to that of a saintly disposition that has nothing at heart but an intense desire to discover objective truth? This is where the problem arises with global-warming scientists. If results are tainted because someone favoring a particular outcome lavishes rewards on the scientists and then uses their results for a tendentious purpose, why are they not similarly tainted in a public policy context?<p>Consider that the science of global-warming has assumed the role of a reigning orthodoxy (what else do you call something that has taken on the status by which its proponents insist that it is beyond the pale even to question its correctness?). Consider further that it is being used to justify the potential imposition of taxes and payment transfers running into the trillions of dollars, thus serving to enlarge the powers of governments exponentially from levels previously known and accepted in free societies. Consider finally that it is serving as the basis to justify potential government intervention and control in the most minute details of what used to be considered every citizen's private life (the size of our cars, how many times we flush the toilet, whether we use this or that substance for this or that purpose).<p>Even a casual glance at this situation suggests that <i>massive</i> ""vested interests"" lie behind the science of global warming. This is not even to mention that, as a reigning orthodoxy, it has set up an environment where all the rewards and perks for a scientist from established institutions exist for those who become proponents of this particular viewpoint and, conversely, all the detriments and penalties lie against those who oppose it.<p>Why, in such a context, would anyone expect the ""public interest"" scientists to be anything <i>other</i> than mere advocates for a position as opposed to objective seekers of truth.<p>I grew up worshiping at the shrine of reason and the enlightenment and have the utmost respect for what true science represents. But the enlightenment had one huge flaw in its premises, and that is that reason will ultimately triumph over other aspects of human nature that parade variously under the titles of ""desires,"" ""appetites,"" ""lusts,"" etc., i.e., the so-called baser human traits. Sadly, those baser traits do not go away and often affect the results of so-called scientific findings. We immediately recognize this with the paid hacks of a courtroom scenario or with with lackeys associated with a private company. It is time we see that the same factors massively pervade those who are nothing but self-interested proponents of a viewpoint that furthers the massive appetites of governments for power and control over people's lives.<p>Is there such a thing as objective science discovered and delineated by persons of integrity? Absolutely. Is this form of science likely to be found in the midst of a politically-driven movement? Possibly, but highly unlikely. Science and politics are indeed different and mixing the two is far more likely to yield tainted results than objective outcomes.<p>This piece, by the way, reads like an almost bittersweet reflection on how the lofty claims of science have run upon the rocks of sad reality and fallen all too short of their aspirations.",1260392745

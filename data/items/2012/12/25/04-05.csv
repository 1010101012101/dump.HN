I live in the south, were the winters are cold (it gets to 0C in some years) but the summers are ridiculously hot and humid (35C+ most of the time, sometimes the ""feels like"" is 45C). Most people here have a hard time with the heat, despite having lived here all their lives. Sometimes it's so incredibly hot that setting air condition to the lowest possible temperature only prevents it from getting hotter and hotter inside the house, but it still feels damn hot all day.<p>Personally, heat makes me literally sick. My blood pressure plummets (even though I have very good health), I can't think straight (productivity drops to like 10% of what I'm able to accomplish in winter), and I feel extremely stressed. I also get skin rashes and abdominal pain frequently.<p>Thank God I'm moving to Seattle next month :) I know it can get very hot in the summer there, but at least they get short summers.

There is no Flash support so I can't go to certain sites (like Beatport Sounds). There are sites that don't render properly and overall the text is rather small and I haven't figured out a way to increase the size yet (not sure if it is the smaller screen size to blame or there is just not a way to increase that size).<p>One thing that I have found to be an annoyance is the search button on the bottom of the phone. No matter what it will bring me to the Bing search, which is good unless it is hit by accident. There is an archery game that I enjoy that has you press and drag to aim and quite often I'm brought to the search screen because my finger goes out of the screen area and hits the search icon. My fault? Of course, but it is incredibly frustrating.<p>The other thing I hate is volume control. There are only two. One for in call volume and then one for the ring tone. That seems great, except that the ring tone volume also controls headphone/media volume. If I want my ringtone low then my volume for youtube will be low. If I want to my ringtone to be loud (which I haven't been able to get, even with the volume turned all the way up to 30 out of 30 I can still barely hear it) and so will all my media. I wasn't happy with my previous Android phone (HTC Evo 4G) but at least my volume for media was separate from my volume for ringtone.<p>Overall, I'm happy with it and some of the addons from Nokia are amazing; such as an app that uses augmented reality and shows various attractions (restaurants, gas stations, etc) in the area while you are holding up your camera. It will mark them on your screen as well as tell you how far you are from that location and the ability to get quick reviews. Plus it shows a compass in the upper right which allows you to know which direction it is in. While there are major issues, in my eyes, that need to be fixed, I still think the phone is better than the Android phone I had before and for only $30 with a new plan (due to $20 trade in credit and just Verizon slashing the price) you can't really go wrong.",1356408318

We live in the age of Big Science, where scientific advancement requires large teams of highly skilled people using very expensive equipment and instrumentation. A lot of the advancements in physics in the late 19th century and early 20th century were done by one or two researchers with small scale university resources. Today, these same sorts of advancements are done by international teams of scientists using particle accelerators that require massive government investment by multiple countries.",1356408215

They have little discipline. They're all terrible procrastinators and find it almost impossible to make themselves do anything they're not interested in. One still hasn't sent out his half of the thank-you notes from his wedding, four years ago. Another has 26,000 emails in her inbox.<p>I'm not saying you can get away with zero self-discipline. You probably need about the amount you need to go running. I'm often reluctant to go running, but once I do, I enjoy it. And if I don't run for several days, I feel ill. It's the same with people who do great things. They know they'll feel bad if they don't work, and they have enough discipline to get themselves to their desks to start working. But once they get started, interest takes over, and discipline is no longer necessary.<p>Do you think Shakespeare was gritting his teeth and diligently trying to write Great Literature?

You can start graduating people early but then you are just graduating less experienced people.

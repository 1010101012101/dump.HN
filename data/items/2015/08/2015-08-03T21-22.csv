We offer a paid trial month. As for the product we&#x27;ve found &quot;market-fit&quot; and we&#x27;re now iterating towards a robust scalable finish.<p>As a developer at spiffy you only work 20 hours a week, all we require is that you&#x27;re around in the afternoon, there&#x27;s no hierarchy & no management, we work in small vertical teams and you&#x27;re expected to decide, design, implement, maintain & support. The wage (for everyone) is €3000 per month + VAT for now but you&#x27;re employed as a consultant (less tax) and can take on other projects at the same time, not enough to live in London or Zurich but enough to live somewhere with a nice beach or even in Berlin (like me).<p>As for tooling, we use github, jenkins & slack and we&#x27;re always constantly improving. There are no skype calls, no meetings of any kind, no standups, no performance reviews, just open and honest communication.<p>We are only looking for senior developers (3+ years) at this moment who can be around in the afternoons Central European Time<p>I personally would like to work with someone who employs TDD pragmatically and writes clean maintainable code. Who is widely read, possessing a depth of experience and able to bring ideas to the table. Experience building, operating & testing distributed systems would be a massive plus.<p>At the moment we&#x27;ve developed a microservice architecture on app engine and we&#x27;ll be moving to containers in the near future. We don&#x27;t expect you to have three years of Go experience but you need have something in Go/Golang to show us.<p>Just write a short cover letter detailing your past projects and what you&#x27;ll bring but don&#x27;t forget to indicate that you&#x27;ve read into what the company is about.

The best we&#x27;ve got so far are tools like Patreon and Bountysource&#x27;s similar system.

10000158,comment,9999284,9999284,0,0,netcan,,,"Automation and labour is a question we have a history of being repetitively wrong about. So, its worth treading lightly.<p>First of all, we use the word “automation” which already implies replicating people. We could just as easily use “tools.” There is a lot of grey area between automation and tools and economically the two are fungible anyway. If we think of new tools being invented, we think of people’s productive capacities being enhanced rather than replaced. Is a combine harvester a tool or automation?<p><i>“There is no fundamental economic law that guarantees every adult will be able to earn a living solely on the basis of sound mind and good character.”</i><p>I think this is a good thing to be pondering. Our modern economy, our political philosophies and I think most of our ideas of how society works kind of assume that every adult with decent character <i>is</i> be able to earn a living. This is why living wage debates get people so fired up. The rug gets pulled out from under all our political ideas if this doesn’t hold more or less true.<p>Overall, I think this paper goes down the right track. Historically, demand for stuff has been remarkably elastic. We can consume a lot of stuff. Automation is essentially tools for producing more. We have good historical examples of the workforce becoming more sophisticated to take advantage of these tools and continue being useful.<p>I do think it could be dangerous relying on the historical analogy, because as the quote above suggests the is no rule in economics that makes this necessary.<p>I do see a couple of avenues to worry about.<p>(1) One is the vaguely Marxist one: labour & capital. Automation is capital. It accumulates in ways that concentrate wealth. If the 99% thing we are seeing now is indicative of a long term trend dictated by technological progress… Marxist conflict dynamics may well play out in some way. Growing wealth gaps create social-political instability that’s hard to avoid.<p>(2) The pace of change. Technological progression’s effect on everyday life is moving very fast. The digital divide thing is real, way more than it was ten years ago. I recently spoke to a woman (about 40) who has never really had a computer that couldn’t get up to speed in hospitality work because she couldn’t leaner the software and its quirks fast enough. Workforce skills keeping up with technological progress is part of the process. But historically, this has been something schools could lead because the pace of change was generational. These days the rate of change is revolutionizing occupations much quicker. That could leave a lot of people behind.<p>I think demand elasticity will hold We can keep consuming more. I think the problem is in the workforce’s ability to keep up. There are plenty of potential jobs today, if the skills were available. I think if we got a 100% increase in the number of skilled programmers of the caliber that Google and FB are fighting over, the economy would absorb them pretty easily. Same for a lot of professions. The problem is that the skill sets required keep getting more sophisticated. That means inflexible labour markets.",1438638755
10000157,comment,9999284,9999284,0,0,Animats,,,"Many &quot;bullshit jobs&quot; in finance exist only because of legal quirks, and could be eliminated by minor regulatory changes. Finance has about 5% of US jobs. Manufacturing has 7%.  We need to get finance down and manufacturing up.<p>It would be straightforward to downsize the insurance industry.  Insurance is complicated because insurance companies want it complicated so they don&#x27;t have to compete on price. Much to the annoyance of the insurance industry, Medicare supplement policies are limited to 10 standard options, A through N. (There used to be more). So comparing companies means looking at a table of prices vs standard forms.  If that was extended to other types of policies, the insurance industry&#x27;s marketing operations would be much smaller.<p>Finance could be downsized by imposing a Tobin tax on financial transactions.  One takes effect on January 1, 2016 in the European Union.  It&#x27;s 0.1% on most transactions, and 0.01% on derivatives transactions. That&#x27;s enough to kill the high frequency trading industry and downsize derivatives trading by 90%, based on Sweden&#x27;s experience.<p>The excess labor can be reassigned to more productive jobs in the lower levels.",1438638734

His organization, and a couple of others like FOLAR (<a href=""https://folar.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://folar.org</a>), have been changing the way the city of LA approaches storm water.<p>As a nearby comment mentions, building regulations had been designed to convey rain water to the sea as fast as possible, due to a justified fear of floods.  At the micro level, this means diverting rain water to concrete channels (e.g., streets or drainage channels).  For instance, when I put in a building in my back yard, I had to install a pump to pump the water from a tank filled by the rooftop gutter into the street, rather than letting it soak in to my yard.<p>Now, multiply that by millions, and you can see we&#x27;re wasting a lot of water.<p>Changing the whole conception of storm water (&quot;collect and dispose of&quot; -> &quot;disperse and soak in&quot;) involves changing building codes and city/county/state infrastructure practices.<p>Because ground water is all externalities, there is no ready market solution.",1438638685

The JRE would be written in C or C++ (non-GC&#x27;d), and Java is GC&#x27;d.<p>In general an interpreter can add any additional or different semantics it needs to on top of the host language&#x27;s semantics. I don&#x27;t think your call-by-value claim is correct either, because function calls in the interpreted program do not map one-to-one to function calls in the interpreter.

Then, let&#x27;s say other organizations, such as Columbia University also run a network. People sign up there as well. You want a system which seamlessly and transparently handles all the social integrations. If I have an account with NYU and then sign up on Columbia&#x27;s social network, I should be able to find my friends (but only the ones that want to be found) automatically and see their user names because they are in my contact list. Columbia would host various &quot;social apps&quot; on this platform, which would all have a common way to deal with users, data, privacy etc. Let&#x27;s say one of those apps is Chess, and another is Presentations. I can invite friends to play chess on the Columbia servers or edit a presentation hosted there. If we want, any one of us can start our own network and invite friends. And they wouldn&#x27;t have to tell each other, &quot;I am XYZ123 on the Columbia network&quot;, it would just all link up. Privacy, contacts, etc. it would all work across all the domains.

The difference isn&#x27;t about speed, but about quality of interaction.<p>Today&#x27;s minimal UIs are a good impedance match for the limited cycles available. iOS was particularly good at leading the way on this, creating a UI that was relatively undemanding of raw cycles but still created an unexpectedly immersive experience.<p>A big part of that was the move from type-and-point to drag-and-tap. The tactile mode, the skeuomorphism, and the portability and instant access compensated for having to squeeze the UI into a tiny screen.<p>It felt like a more responsive experience even though it was quite a bit slower and more rationed than equivalent interaction on a full-sized desktop.<p>That&#x27;s still true today. You can get stuff done on a tablet, but the most efficient and productive UIs pre-ration the affordances. A desktop is much more flexible/general and gives you much more visual bandwidth.<p>If you apply this idea to hypothetical 1000X hardware, you won&#x27;t get more of the same but faster - you&#x27;ll get completely new modes of interaction, which will likely combine the immediacy of touch with the high bandwidth of desktop interaction, and take them much further than anything available today.<p>It&#x27;s possible to imagine all kinds of science fiction experiences. The reality will probably still be a surprise.<p>Even so - the point is really that today&#x27;s users feel like they&#x27;re doing everything they want, because UIs are designed without affordances that would be slow and frustrating given today&#x27;s hardware.<p>That will change with faster hardware and new designs, and phone UIs will seem as quaint as a 720 x 350 monochrome desktop PC screen running DOS.",1438637740

All you need is access to the roots and the ability always to determine which data is another pointer. The main &#x27;enemy&#x27; of this is the ability to cast integers to pointers (as you may in C/C++).<p>Interpreters don&#x27;t necessarily do GC: if the language that the interpreter is written in has GC, then the interpreted language is automatically GCed. If the interpreter is written in a non-GC language you have to manage the interpreted program&#x27;s memory manually too (which you may do using a GC for the interpreted language).
As an aside: this is comparable to evaluation order: if the interpreter is written in a call-by-value language, then the interpreted language is CBV, if the interpreter is written in a lazy language, the interpreted language has lazy evaluation. (Assuming you are not doing something fancy like translation to continuation-passing-style.)",1438637663

9999959,comment,9998140,9999475,0,0,eslaught,,,"The issue is not having the type info available. AOT compilers certainly have that (or at least, enough of it to get the job done).<p>The issue is that most compilers with precise GC---AOT or otherwise---are built around that assumption from the very beginning. Therefore, they choose representations, algorithms, and optimizations that are amenable to GC, and in particular don&#x27;t destroy the type info necessary to make GC work.<p>It is possible in theory to do the same with LLVM, but difficult in practice. Most existing LLVM-based GC&#x27;d languages compromise on performance by requiring LLVM to &quot;root&quot; pointers, effectively forcing them to stay on the stack (instead of registers) so that the GC can see them when it needs to. LLVM&#x27;s optimizations (particularly at the machine-specific level) were previously allowed to do arbitrary things with register-based pointers, which is obviously bad for a GC if no copies of those pointers exist on the stack. It just takes a long time to take a code base that large and untangle the code from such basic assumptions.<p>This appears to be changing, as the release nodes for LLVM 3.6 indicated. But it will take time. In the mean time languages on LLVM are either going with conservative GCs, or with precise GCs with the performance degradation noted above (e.g. OCaml), or with no GC (e.g. Rust for the time being).<p>Source: My talk on precise GC for Rust (from 2012): <a href=""https://github.com/elliottslaughter/rust-gc-talk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/elliottslaughter/rust-gc-talk</a>",1438637239

9999886,comment,9994966,9998247,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Good points, I don&#x27;t really know. Germany&#x27;s currently producing 10% of electricity with wind, assuming they&#x27;d triple that to 30%, and then assuming that say about 25% of the generated wind energy falls so far outside of peak demand hours that it&#x27;s excess energy to-be-stored.<p>That&#x27;d put the daily storage at 140 gwh for Germany, or 140m kwh. (so definitely billions on a global scale).<p>Tesla cars might be a decent comparison point, they sell about 50k cars a year (more even this year), at an average of a 80 kwh battery per car they produce 4 gwh of storage each year.<p>But the Tesla gigafactory is set to produce a projected 85 gwh (of battery packs and cells combined) in a few years. Tesla&#x27;s current battery products are set to last 15 years, although this may not be a reliable figure to use as it&#x27;s a consumer grade, not utility grade product. But assuming it is, then every replacement cycle it can produce 1275 gwh of storage. Germany (with my crappy and quick  assumptions above) would need about 140 gwh, and Germany represents about 1/16th of the world economy by the way, so a global figure with Germany&#x27;s model would require 2240 gwh, about twice the projected 15 year production of the gigafactory. (which, we ought to assume, wasn&#x27;t built without checking if there was enough lithium to run it :p, and given there&#x27;s already talk of the next one (it&#x27;s been renamed gigafactory 1, this alone probably says that lithium running out probably isn&#x27;t the biggest concern).<p>About reserves though... well there&#x27;s lots of resources, like close to 40 million tons. reserves (resources that are, today, economically and technically feasible to extract) are lower, but still a substantial 14m tons.<p>So how much does storage need... well for one we can look at annual production which is 36k tons for 2014. So if we capped out at today&#x27;s rate, the 14m tons of reserves (the resources that can be mined at a profit), would last close to 400 years. I think it&#x27;s pretty likely we&#x27;ll hit a rate of usage that&#x27;s 3-4 times higher than it is today at some point, so that&#x27;d drop that figure down to just 50 years. But I also think more resources will become reserves (as mining technology cheapens), and more resources are found (as exploration techniques improve, see shale gas), and I also think recycling will pick up and increase net production without reducing reserves (afaik recycling is still small for lithium, but growing).<p>One thing to note here is that apparently lithium is only accountable for about 1% of a battery&#x27;s cost (at least a few years ago, with lithium prices not dropping and battery prices dropping the past years, it may be a few percent by now). This is generally good news as it means that you can pay e.g. (hypothetically) 5x as much for lithium while barely increasing the price of a battery by a few percent. And if lithium prices go up by 5x, then more resources become reserves, and more resources will be found through exploration due to renewed economic feasibility, meaning lithium scarcity can be sharply reduced without increasing prices of batteries much at all.<p>Actually I found some numbers too, about 500g of lithium metal for every 1 kwh of storage. So how much storage can we built if we exhausted the 14m reserves entirely, well almost 30k gwh. For comparison, The International Renewable Energy Agency called for 150 GW installed capacity by 2030, which corresponds to roughly 200 gwh or so.<p>Plus the company I mentioned is going for ridiculous amount of cycles, like 40k of them. That&#x27;s a very long lifetime compared to say the 5k cycles of the new 7kwh Tesla powerwall, or the 1.5k cycles of the 10kwh version. That means production can be cut in half because batteries last longer, to sustain the same storage levels. Plus grid-scale storage I think is much easier to recycle compared to consumer storage.<p>So I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve got a resource problem, but again all of these are back of the envelope numbers I&#x27;m just throwing out there. I also didn&#x27;t mention that batteries are only about a third of total lithium consumption, so there&#x27;s that, too. The other issues you mentioned though are there and definitely need to be overcome.",1438636642

9999791,comment,9995788,9999141,0,0,wuch,,,"If I were to compare complexity C++ and Java, I would say that the former is
much more complex and intricate than latter. Complexity of both of course keeps
increasing. But, that does not necessarily mean that programming in any of them
is getting more complicated. Argument is often made, for example by Stroustrup
himself, that while language is getting more complicated, using it is getting
easier and more intuitive. This argument seems to have some merit.<p>Going back to C++ / Java comparison, lets have a look at some objective and
subjective metrics. I am analyzing &quot;The Java Language Specification - Java SE 8
Edition&quot; and &quot;Working Draft, Standard for Programming Language C++ N4527&quot;, in
case someone would like to repeat this exercise.<p>The Java specification has 780 pages, C++ standard has 1367 pages. Of course
there are quite a few objections to be made about this comparison. First, if
you open both standards side by side it is quite clear that typesetting and
margins are quite different. Java has wider margins and a bigger font. So as a
next step lets have a look at number of words. I converted both PDFs to text
using pdftotext and counted number of words using &#x27;wc -w&#x27;.  This gives 227958
words for Java specification, and 477719 words for C++ standard.<p>But that is still hardly fair. C++ standard contains description of standard
library, Java specification in general does not (partially it does specify
Object, Class, Thread, and some of exceptions, but lets ignore this issue). How
many pages of C++ standard constitute description of standard library? I would
say that all from &quot;17. Library Introduction&quot; up to &quot;30. Thread support
library&quot;, additionally including &quot;Index of library names&quot;. Those constitute 777
pages, leaving only 590 for description of C++ language itself. That would be
less than Java specification, but if we go back to word metric, this gives us
249186 words for C++ standard, a little bit more than Java, but not much.<p>From more subjective perspective, I would say that Java specification is
written using much simpler language, but that does mean that it is less
precise. Moreover it seems to me that Java specification contains more
non-normative text than C++ standard does. I would also say that reading Java
standard from front to back doesn&#x27;t seem to be very challenging (with small
exceptions like overloading, which seems to be one of most complex parts of
Java). And when I write &#x27;reading&#x27;, what I am really mean is reading and
understanding.  On the other hand I would never said similar thing about C++
standard. Understanding C++ just by reading standard seems almost impossible,
as most of commentary and useful discussion is contained elsewhere: in
proposals and defect reports.",1438635799

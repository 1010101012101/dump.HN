25533,comment,25527,25527,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"This sounds like a great idea - allowing the user to work offline with effectively the same application as the online version if I understand what they are doing correctly.  Then syncing of the data once online again.  The key downside of using online apps is: what do you do when you're offline and need to work.  Could this be the beginning of the solution?",1180569059

25526,comment,25410,25434,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""I don't want to sound like I am indorsing or rejecting anything I would just like to see more creative income models.""<p>I don't know how many more creative models there can be.  The list by sharpshoot above gives a pretty good picture of a wide array of business models.  I'm sure there are other ways to make money...but most of the obvious ones (and a few non-obvious ones) are covered by the past YC companies.  I don't know anything about the TechStars companies, so I can't speak to that.",1180567838
25525,comment,25410,25481,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Octopart - Order aggregation, take a cut (or sell company to highest bidder and move on...rumor has it this may have already happened).<p>And going back into previous YC groups:<p>Wufoo - upsells to larger accounts<p>TextPayMe - Something to do with Amazon, apparently.  (But even if that's a misunderstanding, they can take a cut of all transfers.)<p>Inkling - Charge businesses<p>Loopt - Partnerships (""I know where you at!"")<p>But there are a number of YC companies for whom ads will be a significant portion of revenue.  Up-selling to premium services can be a challenging business.  We (Virtualmin) basically are in the up-selling to premium services business, as well, because we have millions of users of our Open Source software and currently only hundreds of paying users.  It's not as hard as I'd feared it might be, however...if there's a compelling value in the upgrade, it's a no-brainer for anyone that uses the product to make money.  Anytime buying a product for a few bucks can make your job easier and your customers happier, it's a win, and most successful business people know that.  Upselling individuals is much harder--they value their time differently.<p>So, I believe free-to-premium works great for business-oriented services and products, and not so much for consumer-oriented businesses.  I'd be curious to know how much flickr was making on its premium service before the acquisition, as it's one of the ""knock out"" success stories for the free-to-premium model, but I wonder if they were actually making enough to make payroll and sustain growth.",1180567321

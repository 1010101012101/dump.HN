Craigslist is NOT a pornographer, so talking about the voluntary (and not for lack of users) removal of their adult section doesn't make sense.<p>2. I think we all understand that at any time some websites will be shrinking, if we're going to talk about pornographers as a whole let's see some statistics about pornographers as a whole.<p>3. I would be very interested to know which sites are growing and which are shrinking. My guess is that themed sites are loving all the piracy, because some percentage of customers will want to see more of the same. Random porn scrapyards are probably getting it the worst, because that's exactly what's being offered for free.<p>-wfg",1284800310

1703902,comment,1699620,1703272,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"[tired] How often do I have to say it ?<p>[Condescending explanation] Among the four freedom, free software gives you freedom 1: the right to private modifications.  Meaning, as long as you do not redistribute the software, you don't have to redistribute the source code.  And if you do distribute a particular version of that software, only that version of the source code must be accessible.  You can still conceal a private fork.<p>Now in the case of software executed remotely, or software as a service, Eben Moglen himself reckons there is a conflict of rights: because the client is effectively using the code, it should have access to the source code.  And because the server do not actually distribute the software, it should have the right not to release anything.<p>You can't satisfy both rights at the same time.  The GPL satisfies one (it is 100% compatible with privacy rights), and the AGPL satisfies the other (and makes itself incompatible with some privacy rights in the process).  That's a pity, because before the rise of software as a service, the GPL was the ultimate freedom respecting licence.  Now you have to choose between two compromises.<p>PS: Don't say ""property"" about software, if you can help it.  It is a inaccurate analogy from the physical goods, which fail to convey the truth about knowledge. (Of course, software is pure knowledge.)",1284797929

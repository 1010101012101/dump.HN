3370661,comment,3370428,3370428,15,0,radagaisus,,,"I taught a new programmer in my department JavaScript and CoffeeScript. Yesterday he told me he saw Notch coding a 2d version of minecraft in Java at a hackaton online, and how weird is the difference between CoffeeScript and Java.<p>Maybe for us there's nothing new in CoffeeScript. Heck, the patterns of programming in javascript, callbacks, functional programming, prototypes, closures, the context of this -- for him it's a lot of stuff to learn and unlearn. Sure, I came with experience in ruby and python, so learning coffee script was just one happy afternoon, but for him it is a language worth learning. keep that in mind.<p>For me, the web is a wild beast we are training. Rails, Coffee Script, and even more importantly - Twitter's Bootstrap are tools we use to express our products in a higher domain language. Bootstrap gives us a common UI for the web that is both beautiful and usable. The fact that I could strap in a day a snappy ajax file upload with plupload into my coffee script view means I have more time to focus on my product instead of my code. That it is less painful to change stuff. Do you ever look at your PHP code from the old days and you admire it? I admire it. I wrote crazy stuff back then. I wrote wrappers and classes and 10,000 lines of utilities just so I can put up a website half the quality of today's websites in double the time.<p>1. Coffee Script is a DSL for writing damn good websites.\n2. (and imho) Coffee Script is a great language.",1324321164

3370636,comment,3370428,3370428,35,0,fab13n,,,"TL;DR: Coffeescript should be seen as a way to enforce good Javascript style, and as such it does a decent job.<p>That's an interesting and very defensible PoV. However, even considered as such, it has some serious warts:<p>* It has no clearly-defined semantics: it's an accretion of rewriting tricks, and as such, it's often very hard to predict how two tricks will interact together, especially when they involve indentation and line-breaks.<p>* It tries to support too many cute idioms, which leads to too many ways to do things. There ought to be one obviously best way to do each thing, for the sake of maintenance and readability.<p>Now, if we consider CS as a presentation layer for JS, then its proper place is in an IDE, not as a compiler. Ideally, files should be stored as JS and converted back to CS transparently when editing. Mixes of real JS and CS->JS code should mesh together gracefully. When a piece of CS is highlighted, the corresponding JS should be shown as a tooltip. And of course, when a backtrace is produced, it should be translated from JS lines to CS lines transparently.<p>Today, CS fancies itself as a compiler, i.e. something which produces object code which should never be dealt with by the programmer. As such, it fails. If it presented itself as a representation/refactoring abstraction, it would be much easier to embrace. Of course, the implementation/integration with an IDE would be an order of magnitude harder than a text->text processor, and would make the language^Wtool liable to editor wars.",1324320855

Focusing so much on the details, I lose sight of a lot of the core things a website like this needs.<p>To answer your questions<p>""How is the game played?""<p>You choose a league, and then a team. From there, you are playing in a football league with 31 other people. The football year goes, Free Agency, Draft, Preseason, Regular Season, Playoffs, Repeat.<p>Different leagues have different rates of play, but I always play 1 spin a day. That's most popular. So every day 1 spin occurs. Most of the time, that is one game day. So every day, a new game is played. You check out the results, make adjustments. Do it all over again. Make some trades, remove guys because of injury. Sign replacements.<p>""Is it like fantasy football?""<p>No. It is more about the football management side of a real pro football team.<p>""Is there a screenshot of what the game looks like""?""<p>The game is the website. I think the most valuable thing here would probably be a link to what a boxscore looks like. What a gamelog looks like. Pieces of the game like that.<p>I have made some recorded sessions that I put on youtube, but it's sort of me talking over me playing.<p>""Are real teams and players in the game?""<p>This is coming with the start of me working on a facebook version.<p>How this works I am still working out.

Customers have the expectation (and aren't told any differently by Amazon) that they'll be able to treat purchases just like any other on Amazon.<p>On Amazon if I get something (a shirt) and when I get it I realize that I simply don't really like it, I can return it and they are more than happy to take the return. Same with Zappos or other companies that are generally excellent with returns from customers. But the reason they are cool with it, is because there is a large chance you'll deal with them again. A small loss in trade of happiness for likely future purchases.<p>But being one of the thousands of vendors on Amazon, I'm guessing you don't have this outlook. I personally can't remember the name of a single Amazon vendor I've bought from. I only buy from them if there's either no other options, or if they are offerring significantly cheaper (even when factoring in Prime shipping, which few of them do) than Amazon themselves.<p>Another thing it brings up is why these companies sell books for 16 cents, or even less to begin with. Clearly, that can't be a way to make for successful business, so like sellers on eBay tried many years ago (and still some today) they are trying to make up for it on shipping fees, in order to beat out competition and likely to avoid giving Amazon a cut.<p>I don't think Alex is being unreasonable, given that the standards of the Amazon storefront are such that allow for such. On other storefronts, it would be less acceptable. I don't think trying to return an item in an eBay auction for example that is in perfect condition and as-described in acceptable.

""Reverse a linked list, writing your code on this whiteboard"" is general enough that most applicants can answer.<p>I understand that people who lack CS degrees might not know the answer.  Interviewing means accepting that you don't get a 100% accurate result.  I would only switch away from the ""basic CS question"" problems if I was convinced that some other question has a higher accuracy rating, and I'm not sure of that.",1324319749

You are aware of your surroundings, but you feel comfortable and at ease.<p>red = You are highly alert, you are scanning every single person, you are scanning all situations, you are watching for unexpected movement, you are watching facial expressions and body language, you are looking for exits, you know what locations would be safe and what locations wouldn't be safe. Some people have said they experienced a sort of tunnel vision in that you don't nothing anything but potential threats.<p>People that spend a long time in the red zone can have significant issues with PTSD, it can put you on edge, make it difficult to function in society.

Something as insane as telling them to do jumping jacks will work.<p>I've been in that situation before, I've been the first responder on site and while I have limited medical knowledge I knew enough to check pulses and verify that people were ""okay"", as soon as the second and third people showed up I started yelling orders at them. For some reason this causes them to do without asking ""why"" whatever you are telling them to do. Call 911, block off the road, turn on hazards, warn people coming down the roads, get a blanket, get water, I need a knife to cut the seatbelt.<p>Shout status updates to the person on the 911 call.<p>In my case a vehicle had caught on fire and I wanted to get everyone away as soon as possible. I started yelling at people to get out of the way at least a 100 ft and get down, I didn't want to risk an explosion (yes, I am aware of how unlikely it is, and it didn't happen this time) but there was a fire in the engine compartment. At that point a doctor had stopped, I was yelling at him to get away when he mentioned he was a doctor, I told him to help me get the person out of the vehicle that was on fire. Two other strong volunteers had made their way over to the other vehicle and were pulling the three people out of that vehicle (which had fared much better).<p>To this day I still don't remember faces, I don't remember much of what I did or how I did it, but I do remember a police officer telling me that I should consider myself a hero because I did what I should have done. He told me how the other people told him that I was yelling orders like a mad man and that I seemed to have the scene under full control.

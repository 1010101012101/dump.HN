The crisis wasn't so bad when it started with higher-than-expected defaults in subprime credit markets, but people are panicking a lot more now that liquidity is drying up for high-quality assets. Many firms' business models are based around having access to sufficient liquidity, they aren't built to buy and hold.",1205326343

His reasons are contain many spurious claims such as 'Do I speak as a member of the 'privileged class''? If you willâ€”but classes in the United States are mobile, not static, which is the Marxist view.""  Nope.  That's what America likes to believe of itself, but the reality doesn't match.  If you're born poor in America, you'll most-likely stay poor.  Google it.  The classes aren't as static as 150 years ago, but they still exist and are much more distinct in America than most European countries.<p>Personally, I was a non-brain-dead conservative (Libertarian) who has become a non-brain-dead liberal (Socialist).  Why?  Because it's humane and because it works.  Norway, Denmark, Switzerland -- all have strong social policies and all are richer countries than America.  All of these countries have almost no crime and no homelessness.  When you minimize the divisions between rich and poor, everyone benefits.",1205324897

The big drawbacks are that your interface is still pretty noisy (though you can preprocess some of those XML headers and CDATA section tags into the page if necessary), and using XPath or DOM functions to update the XML isn&#x27;t really very fun. Still, though, it&#x27;d be interesting to see what could be done with it, even if it&#x27;s probably not a front end I&#x27;d like to wrestle with for daily development.",1417848941

A few of us would be fantastically wealthy and powerful, but even they would be limited by living in a violent world populated by uneducated and over-exploited masses incapable of doing things like getting an education and finding their own passions that lead to innovation, invention, and creativity.<p>The pleasant life you live today is due to government regulations. You know how you can shop at the grocery store without fearing that something you buy might literally kill you? You know the drugs you take for headaches? For whatever ailments you have? It&#x27;s nice knowing there&#x27;s some science behind those, right? Nice knowing they won&#x27;t kill you, right? Speed limits? Are they a good idea? You might be more likely to think so if you had kids and wanted to feel safe allowing them to play outside. Flying to an awesome tech conference anytime soon?

8708545,comment,8708396,8708396,0,0,ignoramous,,,"The transport industry is not well regulated in India. As a result, every other month prices go up. So much so that the cost has doubled for some routes. And Uber is poised to make a killing here. One example is how they charge 100 Rupees (about $2) as &#x27;toll fee&#x27; for rides to the Airport. The interesting part is there is NO TOLL whatsoever if the cab is in and out within 10mins. Even if you exceed 10 mins, the actual charge is 65 rupees (around $1). Flat 100 Rupee charge is actually too steep when you consider that the entire ride cost you a mere 250 Rupees excluding the toll fee.<p>Repeated contact with customer support at Uber is like talking to a wall. Out of the 4 contacts I had with them, I got a response only once. They didn&#x27;t respond even when I literally BEGGED them to. In a sense you feel helpless with these corporates with no-face and corportes that take their customers for granted. Even though I have 1200 Rupees ($20) worth of free rides with Uber, I have since switched to local competitors. I simply don&#x27;t trust them. Esp in a country like India where they aren&#x27;t and won&#x27;t be held accountable for liabilities.<p>Free market / unregulated market won&#x27;t do consumers any good. Uber solves a lot of pain points and is an excellent product-- but the Government needs to step in with newer but accommodating regulations-- perhaps an open API for ride sharing, and a standard ride-fare API, and such. I don&#x27;t see that ever happening in India to be honest.",1417846261

The costs of those hits must be realized somewhere in Uber (as in hiring David P.). Whereas Lyft can essentially sit back, garner goodwill, and enter a the market as a full competitor without expending the same resources. Now realize, that they can only do that because Uber also exist, and Uber does some of the dirtier work. If Lyft on it&#x27;s own was trying to open new territories, they&#x27;d probably be a bit more like Uber. But it&#x27;s a good lesson in creating a competitive advantage from unwanted competition.

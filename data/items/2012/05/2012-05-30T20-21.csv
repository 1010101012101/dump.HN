Startups tend to demand more overtime than established companies, and quickly, the already reduced effective hourly rate starts dwindling down into fast-food employee territory.<p>Sure, the startup work might be fun, but you could get the same or more money from another job and do fun things after work.<p>Also, be prepared to add some risk to account for the chance that the currently well-intentioned startup owners will screw you over if things get bad.<p>Once you factor in the failure rates of startups, standard vesting times, etc., all that money you're giving up translates into one very expensive lottery ticket.<p>So if you go in with your eyes open, i.e., you're willing to forego that salary difference with a possibility of a zero return, then yeah, knock yourself out, because if you do win the lottery, it's a huge pay day. If you don't win the lottery, you knew it was a gamble, so no big deal.<p>Before jumping into bed with a startup for a huge salary cut though, a person might do well to ask him/herself if they'd be better off at a job with full pay and using half the salary to play the stock market.",1338411489

Notice how it uses color exclusively as a subtle callout. Notice how the color choice highlights effectively but doesn't draw a blinding neon sign.<p>By contrast, the infographic you like uses illustrations incorrectly; for instance, isn't it confusing the area and radius of circles? Notice how it uses multiple pictures each drawing a single comparison on a single axis. Think about how many words the same comparison takes in prose (not hard, because all those words are included in the infographic in gigantic type above the illustration, often in radioactive neon green).<p>--- Also: note that this [unfavorable] comparison is against a relatively weak example of explanatory illustration --- the best examples in _VDQA_ are way, <i>way</i> better than these NYT examples, which are a bit chartjunky themselves.

Unless the comparison is to framework level features like ASP.NET Session State, but PHP would only work around that by using memcached or something, right? Or is this referring to the fact that I can't have shared variables at all, so I can't cache super common data structures in a local piece of RAM?<p>""2. I wont need experts"" - It must be nice, if boring, to be working on really simple codebases where anyone that can hack PHP can work on your application.<p>""10. Dynamic typing"" - There are plenty of neat reasons for dynamic typing, like easy metaprogramming and whatnot. Having crazy type coercion isn't one of them. And ""HTTP is untyped so should PHP""; I'm not sure what to make of this.<p>This goes along with ""11. It plain works"" -- yea, depends on how you define works. ""A lot of that is based on assumptions (or shortcuts) that PHP takes to solve a problem.  Most often those shortcuts work, and the workarounds are very easy to implement (Im thinking mainly about strict type checking here).""<p>And that's the real issue that I can see with PHP. Sometimes, some stuff might sorta make sense, and the rest of the time you're in this weird ""gotcha"" land, with the inconsistent API and language design.<p>The only compelling reason I've seen for using PHP is ""well, pretty much every server has it installed, and it's super easy to get working with a webserver"".

I find it very interesting that points brought up against PHP (weak typing, easy to write swiss cheese security code, framework overload) are generally it's greatest strengths as well.<p>Let's take the weak typing issue for example: Sorry, you should be keeping track of your variables. If you can't do this, then just define your own object and use it. I do this with just about all return types now; it's pretty nice to always know what type of variable you're going to be dealing with on the other side of your MVC. The worst thing that comes from this issue (which exists in every weakly typed language) is improper use of comparison operators (!= vs. !==, == vs. ===). Again, this is up to the developer.<p>PHP will give you the lumber and the rope, but it's up to the developer if you hang yourself or manage to build a galleon.

Filesystems are used more for organizational purposes than anything.  Most of my folders are logically named and organized rather than physically based because of the types they contain.  Probably the filesystem API will evolve into something more tag-based than hierarchical, but you never know.  The filesystem hierarchical folder metaphor is re-used in tons of places where there's really no need for it physically.  Why?  Because there's a logical need for it.<p>Additionally, file system APIs provide lots of useful abstractions such as opening resources, closing them, reading to, writing from, appending to, etc.  When you go to do your backup in process space, which data is in a self-consistent state that can be copied?

Of course the client-facing positions can more easily have another metric for determining bonuses, though I think many times those metrics are pretty flawed.<p>Anyway.

In general, when all applicable safety systems are employed (seatbelts, nothing obstructing airbags, Etc) the injuries sustained are rarely fatal and for the most part don't required a hospital stay. We have a condition called ""Tule Fog"" which is a dense low hanging fog that can occur rather suddenly, which every other year or so results in the collective colliding of anywhere from 3 to 75 vehicles at speeds from 10MPH to 60MPH. Again, people don't die in these pile ups generally unless the passenger space of the vehicle is compromised (like being shoved under the trailer of a semi-truck for example).

You sound scattered.<p>It's difficult to give you specific advice without knowing more about the ins and outs of your business.  However I would suggest answering a few questions for yourself:<p>- Which of your three products is generating income? If it is the moble app then start there. Drop the others and focus your attention on what IS working. Read PG's article on ideas. To summarize PG you can only focus on one thing at a time.  I think he is spot on.<p>- Why are you receiving late payment? Do you have to manually collect payments each month/year? If so, that might be your problem.  Anything scalable should require little human interference, especially when collecting payments.  For example, you want to download an app, you pay immediately with the credit card Apple already has on file; you sign up for a web app, you enter your credit card info immediately so when the free trial is done your account automatically gets debited. Any business where you must hunt down payments is not scalable.  Perhaps that is what is stunting your growth. Not ""features"" per se.<p>Lastly, talk to your customers to find out what what you are doing right and wrong.  This can't be discovered in a survey because it is too open ended. Call them, email them, whatever. Just tell them you wanted to see how they liked the product, how they use it, what they don't like, etc. if you do this enough you should see a trend.<p>Hope this helps.",1338408804

4044605,comment,4044262,4044262,9,0,nickadams,,,"A little cautionary tale here.<p>TL;DR: You might get a cease and desist or worse for doing things like this. It can be a headache. Be careful.<p>First, I have no idea about all the legal intricacies or accepted uses in this space, so this obviously may not apply in every case -- especially considering our implementation of this was in commercial software (but if anyone has any plans to implement this approach in commercial software, beware).<p>Backstory: We built a CMS for small weekly newspapers. One of the features of that CMS was automatically generated real-time Movie Showtimes. This was handy since previously the newspapers would manually add this info to their websites and it'd quickly be out of date (showtimes change occasionally). And while they had this info for their papers, the means to get this data on their sites was painful. They weren't tech savvy number one, but even if they were, these API's from TMS (Tribune Media Services -- the big guys), CinemaNow, etc are all ridiculous. They don't charge based on API call and they are so poorly designed you end up creating wrappers for their APIs and its all a rats nest.<p>Anyway, our goal was to make this easier, so we did something very similar to the poster -- essentially scraping the web content and repurposing it on their sites. Admittedly its a bit of a grey area, but we figured it wasn't egregious. Especially since most of them already had the data legitimately for their printed papers. Like the poster we also left the Fandango link in there so users could just purchase a ticket online if they wanted. We didn't see the harm. Fandango still got the purchase whether the user got there from Yahoo, Google, or sites on our CMS.<p>What was the result of this? Cease and desists. First from Fandango. They saw the referrals from our sites, then saw that we were displaying showtimes without being licensed to do so (how they knew this I'm not sure). They told us they had to protect <i>their</i> licenses (they apparently licensed the showtimes from TMS so they felt they needed to act on their behalf or something) so they sent us a cease and desist. Obviously Fandango also passed this info along to TMS too, so next up was a cease and desist from them.<p>The final result was us just paying to use the API's. Which we probably would have done from the beginning if they made any sense at all. It took many phone calls and emails to get them to create a ""special"" package in place for us. We figured we could just pay X per API call for showtimes at theaters in Y zip codes. Nope. Their packages seemingly had no concept of modern web services and instead were structured based on strange market blocks each with a daily minimum of requests that had to be made and so on. Not to mention the fact that we needed to do all this for the multiple clients in multiple regions using our hosted CMS (these concepts of software as a service were foreign to them).<p>It was a while ago so maybe I'm embellishing the ridiculousness of their packages (I'm probably not) and maybe things have changed. But overall, I think it's safe to say, if you plan on scraping these showtime at least don't leave in the Fandango link (they'll find you!). And probably more so, just be careful doing things like this unless you're prepared to read some cease and desists and reacquaint yourself with a fax machine.",1338408778

Fun is to treat the code as if it belongs to everyone equally.<p>Quite lately, I got into a new project with a new set of coworkers and I find the approach of those coworkers a bit strange, at times annoying. Problem is, if there is any bug related to the piece of code that I wrote, few of my coworkers treat it as if its totally my responsibility to resolve it ( even if it means to change a line in properties file ). For instance, today it so happened that my coworker found a bug and she saw the error message in logs coming from the class that I wrote. Immediately without taking any efforts to debug the code, she turned back to me saying I need to get it resolved and get her moving. It gave me a feeling as if I am being a roadblocker to her. I didn't feel like we were looking at the code as a team. She raised hands as if 'that bug belongs to me and I should get back to her when its resolved'. As it turns out in the end, it was a small fix. It was not really a problem with the code but a change in the properties file she had to make according to a path on her machine. I almost feel as if I am spoon feeding my coworker.<p>Not sure if it made any sense to you but if you were in such a situation before then let me know what you did to cope up.

I'm fully aware that none of these could ""just happen"" and the team may have discussed and discounted these ideas many times, but for the purpose of starting a discussion here on HN:<p>- Some subreddits seem more like ""tags"" than communities. /r/pics is a perfect example.  So is /r/nsfw.  These seem more like attributes of a post.  I think reddit could be a little more orthogonal with these types of things.  It would be nice to create a post and check (or have reddit detect automatically) the ""pic"" checkbox.  Then you'd still need to pick a subreddit for the post to go, but hopefully things would be more targeted than just to say it's a picture.  This is already in place for NSFW, and I know people have been asking for NSFL as well.  Making this attribute system more generic and allowing ""virtual"" or ""filtered"" subreddits to be generated from them would be cool.  The main point of this suggestion isn't to help users discover new communities, but to modify the signal-to-noise ratio of existing ones (given that what counts as ""signal"" is subjective).<p>- Crossposting is common and the [X-Post from /r/foo] notation has become <i>de facto</i>.  It might be nice if posts could belong to more than one subreddit.  You could add new subreddits to an existing post if someone from that subreddit saw a post it thought might be a good fit for it.  Additionally, if someone found the post while ""in"" a particular subreddit, an additional type of comment flair could indicate which subreddit he or she was commenting from in a ""multi-homed"" post.  This would help people in larger subreddits discover smaller ones.<p>- Many people have made ""reddit guide"" sites that attempt to list subreddits and help people find new ones.  It would be nice if there was an official reddit guide that used, as much as possible, the metadata for each subreddit.<p>- Building on the previous idea, you could ""tag"" subreddits with optional but standardized metadata.  I can see things like ""appropriate age range"", ""predominant gender"", ""political affiliation"", ""religious affiliation"", ""special interest topic"", and so forth.  If subreddits filled these in, you could actually offer a ""questionnaire"" that users could fill out.  The output of this would be a list of subreddits the user might like (and ones they might hate!). EDIT: Or just use it to make a recommendation system based on the subreddits they already have subscribed, the ones they visit most, the ones with posts they comment on most, and so on.",1338408235

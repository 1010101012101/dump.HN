7728,comment,7684,7684,0,0,euccastro,,,"TBH, my feeling about this stuff is that it belongs in nazi research labs and Cosmopolitan magazines, rather than as a screening tool in business where you want the best people.  If I was considering applying to anything (Y, a job at a company), being presented with this would disappoint me and set off Dilberty alarms.<p>Now, this is fun stuff to burn some minutes while procrastinating!

I'm more comfortable in villages or small towns.",1175298843

This can be a real liability for organisations who are looking for leadership .. looking to promote people with high intelligence'</i> [0]<p>Interesting. I posted a similar post this week on the characteristics found in entrepreneurs ~ <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=7459"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=7459</a><p>      <i>'... all we'll care about is one measure: how close one comes \n      to the best founders. We don't care what atoms are in that \n      molecule ...'</i><p>But testing for characteristics of <i>'high achievers'</i> then correlating test scores against potential applicants is fraught with problems.  Is the correlation against the best enough? [1]<p>I'm sure you might get some correlation but it's pretty unimaginative [2].   So what could be a better tool? What about direct testing of skill? Wouldn't a better technique be simulation? Why not build a <i>'startup simulator'</i> where applicants are given tools to <i>simulate</i> tasks they actually will have to do? Then you have a  controllable scenario where you really can measure results against successful founders.<p>You could test <p>\n- <i>the conception of an idea</i><p>- <i>the building of a  (simple) prototype</i><p>- <i>quickly find an audience</i><p>- <i>find a way to make money off it</i><p>\nWrapped up in a framework [3] where you test the <i>execution</i> of these tasks you could get a better grasp of the <p>\n- <i>skills</i><p>- <i>determination</i><p>- <i>entrepreneurial audacity</i><p>- <i>passion</i><p>- <i>humour</i><p>- <i>leadership skills</i> needed to succeed.   <p>- <i>risk taking, emotional intelligence</i><p>There is a long history of simulators in testing & refining of skills, competency  and execution are required.  Even Captain Kirk at Starfleet Academy trained, passed (and cheated) on simulators.<p>Who knows it might even be fun.<p>Reference<p>[0] Professor Con Stough, Brain Sciences Institute, 'Director, Centre for Neuropsychology, Swinburne Institute of Technology'<p><a href=""http://www.swin.edu.au/bioscieleceng/neuropsych/stough.htm"">http://www.swin.edu.au/bioscieleceng/neuropsych/stough.htm</a><p>[1] But I do like the simplicity of just looking at a simple set of parameters to make a <i>Gladwellian</i> decision.<p>[2] In a competitive environment the difference between getting the attention of the right candidates could be the tools used to measure how they stack up against the best .. but actually doing something, learning and getting some feedback. <p>[3] The framework could be a game, or simply a panel of dials. The key thing is you can have a back room with founders, past entrepreneurs twiddling the dials checking to see in RT how candidates handle things like a person leaving, stressing system etc (like the LEM tester in the Apollo missions). It also allows for candidates to learn from failure with less risk & pass on the best decision making skills to candidates that have passed.\n ",1175298173

7722,comment,7713,7716,0,0,pg,,,"Larry and Sergey went to Michigan and Maryland.  Woz went to Berkeley.  Jobs, I think, did one semester at Reed.  I don't think it matters super much in starting a startup.<p>Stanford is a good place to go if you want to start a startup simply because it's in the middle of Silicon Valley and thus infused with startup culture (in a way that MIT definitely isn't).  But you already seem to have that down.<p>However, where you go to college can have a great effect on how much fun you have and how much you learn, and that is the most important thing.  I'd just go wherever seems to you to have the best intellectual vibe.<p>",1175297599

7718,comment,7684,7684,0,0,volida,,,"ok, my observation is that, the GREEN of most attributes is somewhere in the middle (with some nearer to some side), which means that there is a diversity between to those who you are compared, with 3/4 of the samples to define that side. This means that someone can be in right opposite but it doesn't mean that personality is excluded.but be in the 1/4 of the samples. So, with all this diversity, how valid and helpful is this test?<p>I think the attributes of the test, should be more questions of type, what you do in specific situations, and be compared to what YC would prefer as answer.<p><i> update<p>or am I wrong, and GREEN is the range of answers of the samples?\n",1175296065

7716,comment,7713,7713,0,0,hirematheeth,,,"Hey guys,<p>I am 17 and I posted this because I received my admissions letters this week. I got full rides to every state college I applied but I got wait listed at Stanford, MIT, Harvard, and Caltech. I really don't know how to think of this. Can I still start a successful startup? Can I still be more successful than an MIT undergrad? Is there something about these colleges that makes students there better or is it completely dependent on the student's personality, work ethics, etc.. to be successful?<p>Sorry if the question seems out of whack. I am probably overwhelmed right now by the admissions letters.",1175295862

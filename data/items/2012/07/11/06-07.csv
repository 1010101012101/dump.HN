The nice thing about both of these is they benefit both the employer and prospective employee.<p>1) The best way I know of is if you're referred to a company by someone you know and can trust enough to tell you about the warts beforehand.<p>2) Failing #1, if you find a company you're interested in and who's interested in you, ask them for a contract-to-hire position with a 3-6 month or so contract. It's a great way to really get to know the culture without a huge commitment. They'll do it if they want you, but if they balk you should be able to convince them it's in their best interest as well. Just don't do anything drastic like relocating until you're fulltime.<p>Anyway, good luck.",1341989917

4228111,comment,4224873,4226129,9,0,SkyMarshal,,,"There's little to no comparison b/t the Silicon Valley model and current banking system model.  In the banking system, risk is systemic, in the Silicon Valley model, risk is localized.  The two models are the inverse of each other.<p>In SV, many relatively small investments are spread over lots of startups, with the expectation that something like ~90% will fail, ~9% will just break even, 0.99% will do well, and 0.01% will become the next Microsoft, Google, or Facebook.<p>The small number of successes more than compensate for the huge number of failures, and the failures are not systemic and pose no risk to the greater economy.  There is no apparent way for systemic risk or systemic fraud to undermine the system and put the entire global economy at risk.<p>The banking system on the other hand is the definition of systemic risk.  Every company in <i>every</i> industry depends on it, for short-term cash needs to long-term investment loans.  If the banking system fails for some unrelated reason (say, too much bad mortgage debt used as collateral for too much prop-trading leverage, the financial crisis in a nutshell), then every company in every other industry is at risk of failure as well.<p>Look at the history of banking and you see the same bubble-crisis-collapse played out over and over, to varying degrees of severity.  From 1800 to 1929 there's a banking crisis literally almost every 10 years, with a few 15-20yr gaps.  Read up on the history of banking crises [1] [2] and you can see it's endemic to the system.<p>But that is clearly not the case with the startup ecosystem, because the risk model is the inverse of the banking system risk model.<p><i>If those two mechanisms are failing us, as some people claim, I'd be genuinely curious to know why it fails specifically for banks while it works wonders in other industries such as tech.</i><p>The banking system of late is really creating and concentrating debt, not wealth.  They create assets like mortgage-backed instruments of various sorts, get them AAA-rated, then use them as ostensibly high-quality collateral on which to borrow even more.<p>But when the cash flows on that collateral began to collapse in 2007/2008, it became apparent it wasn't AAA after all, and that it could not support so much leverage, and suddenly the entire system was at risk of insolvency and needed a government bailout, massive central bank support, and economic stimulus to prevent total collapse and all the collateral damage to other industries that entailed.<p>Conversely, Silicon Valley concentrates equity and cash-flow-generating businesses, rather than debt, and high failure rates are expected and built into the financing model.  Risk is limited to the risk-takers, and not the broader economy or government.<p>1.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banking_crisis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banking_crisis</a><p>2.  <a href=""http://www.economics.harvard.edu/files/faculty/51_This_Time_Is_Different.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economics.harvard.edu/files/faculty/51_This_Time_...</a>",1341989549

4228103,comment,4226569,4227601,6,0,tung,,,"The problem with your original comment[1] is that many people feel it has potential you're not only not giving it credit for, but are actively trying to sabotage its chances of success.<p>The crux of your comments are two-fold: (1) if OUYA succeeds, it'll be the Facebook/Zynga console that preys on the poor to line the pockets of the rich, and (2) if it fails, it hurts Kickstarter and Kickstarter projects.<p>The view that ""the vast majority of"" the games of OUYA will be ""built on psychological manipulation"" is the most deeply cynical and skewed views of indie games I've ever read. Maybe I'm biased: I follow indie game developers a lot, I read their forum comments and blog posts, I listen to their podcasts, play many of their games (more than AAA titles) and watch YouTube play-throughs of others by other people. The message is the same: indie game developers are trying to do what they love while introducing something unique and interesting to the world, and those who go full-time want to make ends meet, a lot like many start-up founders. They're pretty frank and don't mince words, and not one of them has so much as hinted that they want to get rich by preying on the weak. This is counter to the Hacker News view, which is stories of indie games making millions of dollars, horrible tales of Facebook and Zynga using gambling psychology to nickel-and-dime the poor and addicted, and the Kickstarter gold rush being exploited by the smart and greedy. If I had to choose which view of indie games was reality, I'd believe the actual developers before the sensational stories that hit the Hacker News front page.<p>As for if OUYA fails, I can't say for sure what impact it will have, but it probably won't hold back Kickstarter or other promising Kickstarter projects. Should it follow the history of failed open consoles of development past, it will at most just fade into the background, never to be heard from again until somebody takes another stab at it.<p>The meatiest part of your original comment (ignoring the deep cynicism ingrained in it that people objected to) are the factors that may cause it to fail:<p>- Ability to deliver on its $99 cost, given most consoles sell at a loss that they recoup in titles.<p>As somebody who watches a lot of StarCraft 2 on TwitchTV and loves the variety of indie games, I'd consider the OUYA worthwhile even at 2-3 times this price.<p>- Anemic hardware: 8 GB for downloaded titles with only USB2 for expansion.<p>Thing like this can and may well be fixed; from OUYA's Kickstarter page[2]:<p>> Launching on Kickstarter  this isn't just a way to raise funds. It's our way of involving supporters from the get go. We want your feedback as well as your support.<p>They seem open to this kind of feedback.<p>- the ""lazy"" (I'd claim short-sighted) factor, e.g. color-coded only buttons are hard to communicate, especially for the color-blind<p>See above. Putting shapes on the buttons would be trivial, and the controller is stated to be a prototype, not a final product.<p>- lack of a killer app and seeming reliance on the Android Market to fill the gap<p>I expanded all the FAQ segments, ran a search on the page and didn't get one hit for ""android market"", so that's just speculation.<p>On not having a killer app, the big sell of OUYA to me isn't the presence of one <i>really good</i> game, but as a nexus of indie games I can quickly try and go through. I played many early versions of Spelunky[3] well before it became big through word-of-mouth. POWDER[4] isn't a massive commercial hit with tons of attention or press, but I've spent many fun hours with it. OUYA presents this one place where I can go through a ton of games to find gems like these; I don't have to worry about THE killer app if I can find MY killer apps.<p>Overall, as a person who plays lots of indie games and watches StarCraft 2, I see potential in OUYA, even if it can only deliver on half of its promises. The deeply scathing and cynical judgment you've passed is not only undeserved, but actively hurts it, which is pretty sad.<p>--<p>[1]: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4224014"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4224014</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ouya/ouya-a-new-kind-of-video-game-console"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ouya/ouya-a-new-kind-of-...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.spelunkyworld.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spelunkyworld.com/</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://www.zincland.com/powder/index.php?pagename=about"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zincland.com/powder/index.php?pagename=about</a>",1341989459

4228096,comment,4224637,4227858,3,0,pron,,,"Alright, sorry for the confusion. Our commercial offering (SpaceBase) is very much targeted at MMOs and real-time LBSs. However, like many start-ups we really do like building cool stuff. And while it indeed the case that Galaxy will soon be a offered as a component of SpaceBase, it is has a very different design from other memory-grid projects/products, so we decided to open-source it to the community and let it explore other possible uses.<p>My post was meant to be an introduction to a series of very technical blog posts discussing theoretical and practical aspects of distributed systems. The post was not meant to serve a clear commercial purpose, so I was trying to steer the discussion away from commercial uses and more to its CS aspects. You know, we really find this stuff interesting. Some of my future posts will discuss the more theoretical sides of Galaxy and will drill very deeply into its design and algorithms, while others will discuss how SpaceBase will make use of Galaxy to help MMOs build huge, rich worlds, and LBSs track lots of moving objects in real-time. To be more concrete and give just a taste, I'll say this: when SpaceBase runs on top of Galaxy, objects are transferred from one node to another to create a dynamic area-of-responsibility for each node. This means that each node will be responsible for processing all objects in some region of the game world (or real world for LBSs). But the regions are <i>dynamic</i> - namely, they shrink and grow to accommodate non-uniform load, so that small busy areas will be split over several nodes, while large, relatively vacant ones will be handled by just one.",1341989306

And I bought, sold and analyzed Abacus.<p>All of these transactions are explicitly caveat emptor. My grandma couldn't go out and buy a piece of ABACUS 2007-ACA; sales are restricted to ""qualified investors"".<p>Of course we all know that's basically meaningless, at least the assumption that ""qualified investors"" always understand what they're doing. I know from experience that ""qualified investors"" in this kind of deal mostly don't do any serious due diligence. [On Abacus, it was practically impossible anyway. There were O(1,000,000) loans underlying the deal and there is no way you'd have been able to get the loan details for even a significant fraction.]<p>But I wonder whether we're expecting more from GS/MS/etc. than we expect from our local car dealer, and whether the remedy should be any different. That is, everyone is told to be suspicious of used car dealers, so you poke around, kick the tires, look for leaks, get a mechanic to look it over, read the repair records, etc. before you buy. If it still turns out to be a lemon, and you discover the dealer told you something explicitly false about the car, you have a legal remedy; otherwise (IANAL) I don't think you do. But you have a social/market remedy, i.e. don't buy from that dealer again and tell your friends not to buy from that dealer again. Likewise, if you find a dealer who always tells it straight and prices it fair, you go back to that dealer the next time and tell your friends about him.<p>Why isn't that the right remedy for these CDO deals as well? Sure, if GS said something provably false about the deal, there's a fraud case. But if (as I suspect is more accurate) they just sold it for what it was (namely an extraordinarly complex and impossible-to-price derivative financial instrument, offering an attractively high risk-weighted rate of return), and the buyers didn't bother (or have the computational resources, as almost none of them did) to do their own pricing analysis, is that the fault of GS? If you buy a CDO and lose your shirt, well, don't buy CDOs again and maybe don't buy from GS if you didn't like how they sold it.",1341987830

The challenge is that every single page of content except for each individual tweet is utterly unique for every user. That defeats the vast majority of straightforward caching implementations. You can't cache fully rendered pages ever because the chance that one random timeline view at a given time will be identical to any other view (even by the same person at a different time) is pretty much as close to zero as possible. Every view is dynamically generated content from up to several hundred or thousand different streams of data and needs to be put in order and have all of the per-user metadata set correctly.<p>Once you start looking into the actual mathematical constraints of the problem of twitter you realize that it's a scaling nightmare.

Our world is ripe with opportunity, but it's a lot of hard work, and a lot of companies will do or say anything to lure us in.<p>I would say I've been a victim of this. After several years of being successful at a mid-sized company, I started seeing talent trickle out the door (bosses, colleagues, VPs, CxOs) for better opportunities. I decided to take a look myself and saw that the industry was full of neon signs and flashy banners.<p>I joined one of these high flying, well funded start-ups that promises insane amounts of rewards, great learning experience, incredible growth opportunity and best of all, family like culture where everyone tries to help each other. It was everything but this... months into the role (I was employee # in the single digits), I started realizing we were having issues growing past employee #10. Most of the problem seem to stem from things like location, industry, but then came the hard sell. I started hearing interviewers literally start telling lies about company culture, life-balance, opportunities, ...<p>I left that mess for an older/significantly larger company, hoping the culture would be established, reputation is known in the tech community, etc. Wrong again. The promises of interesting work and startup like feel translated to ""lots of work to make investors happy and politics up the wazoo"". Being from a startup, my natural inclination was to make sure we delivered on time. At this big company, it often translated to ""If you don't think we can make it on time, you must speak up so you take the brunt of the blame. If you do pull this off, you're going to have to do parts of all of our work along with yours."" Stupid me did the latter, the team got the praise... good times for all, but after a few years of that nonsense, I don't think I can take this any longer. I secretly was hoping by doing all this work, I could rise the ranks quickly to stick it to some of these guys, I ended up seeing them climb the ladders quicker (perhaps cause they had more free time for presentations).<p>Back to the point where I would love some honest advice;<p>What are some good ways to find out what a company culture is like? I've been reading on GlassDoor, I've looked at the Fortune Magazine rankings, I've read about Zappos and actually recently phone interviewed but decided I don't want to move to Vegas, so the conversation died there.<p>But I'm worried, every time I talk to a company, I am worried that I'm getting that same sales pitch that I was so morally against at my own past employer. At the end of the day, a few hours won't tell me much about the people I'll be working with. What to do??? Help...",1341987684

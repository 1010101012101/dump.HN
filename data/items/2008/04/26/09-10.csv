174274,comment,173918,174256,0,0,jrockway,,,"Knuth is solving different problems than Joe Average programmer.<p>I don't think anyone will argue against reusing existing databases, web frameworks, etc. when you are writing a web app.  But if you are, say, writing a new typesetting system... who cares about reusability?  You just need to make it work.  The components aren't typically used elsewhere in that case, so your priority should be writing a good typesetting system, not writing reusable parts.<p>I think that's what he's saying, anyway...",1209203211

174270,comment,173836,174232,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I was merely pointing out the humor in the fact that whenever one says, ""Premature optimization is the root of all evil"", there will be a large number of people who spring to the defense of premature optimization.  I wasn't picking on your post in particular...just the amusing fact that an off-the-cuff comment that didn't really express my intentions very well was the one sentence that got a very vocal response from several people, and yours was the first (and actually the post that signaled for the Premature Optimization Defense League).<p>It's a failing on my part for even bringing up premature optimization at all, particularly if I wanted to discuss anything other than premature optimization (or evil).  I've been programming for over 20 years...I should have known what would happen.",1209202063

Of course, they'll probably end up making money -- more bandwidth required, more money to AT&T.  So wait... I'm actually not sure why they would complain.",1209201289

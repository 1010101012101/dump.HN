To get that kind of difference, you had to have something like, throughout the entire history of the human race, maybe 80% of women but only 40% of men reproduced. ""<p>If you really had only half as many men reproducing as women, you'd get the twice-as-many-women-descendants after a <i>single</i> generation. For the ratio to be 2:1 over the whole of human history implies that it was a <i>much</i> milder, but still systemic, bias. It may or may not be anything evolutionary, though. ",1188057289

If they send you a link to reset it, it's hashed.<p>IIRC, Reddit, MySpace, all LiveJournal clones, and IMDB all store in plaintext.  Drupal installations hash them.",1188054337

It's worth noting that his 8-core machine is equivalent in power to quite a few dual PIII 1.3Ghz machines, which was the standard configuration not too long ago.<p>Scribd is a good Linux example, where they're doing quite a bit of traffic with a single 4-core web server. Although with Rails/Mongrel they'll never be anywhere near as efficient.<p>Markus isn't very forthcoming in mentioning that he has some monster SQL Server machines with a 60 drive 15k RPM SAN. That's doing most of the heavy lifting on his site, and is some expensive gear. His web application is an especially thin front-end to his database.<p>He also has 3 web servers handling his IM stuff.<p><a href=""http://plentyoffish.wordpress.com/2006/12/07/scaling-sql-server-2005-national-tv-usa-canada/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plentyoffish.wordpress.com/2006/12/07/scaling-sql-server-2005-national-tv-usa-canada/</a>

(Zemaj's answer is pretty good, too.)<p>There are two models I can imagine for Twitter: 1) working in advertising, or 2) become a feature of some larger business.<p>You might also speculate that there would be some permutation of Twitter that would be interesting enough to become Twitter Pro or somesuch.

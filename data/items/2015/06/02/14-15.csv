9646247,comment,9643204,9646051,0,0,yaakov34,,,"I think the relevant standard for comparison, from a safety point of view, is with mechanical throttle linkages that were used before throttle-by-wire. And it&#x27;s pretty obvious that the mechanical linkages are less reliable: they involve a long cable snaking around the engine bay. A sticky throttle used to be a common complaint. With these systems, it&#x27;s not. And of course, it&#x27;s the multi-channel redundant brakes that are the critical backup safety system here.<p>BTW, I read through Barr&#x27;s attempted reengineering of Toyota&#x27;s ECU (his slides are linked in the comments). It&#x27;s just making me angry. After going on and on about how bad Toyota&#x27;s code is (spaghetti, blah blah blah), he starts presenting his failure modes: suppose that a random hardware memory error flips some bits in the CPU&#x27;s task table. Then the task monitoring the pedal angle is going to die. Now to get actual unintended acceleration as described (when the driver is pressing the brake), you also have to suppose that the throttle position variable is corrupted at the same time. Other than the general unlikelihood of this, consider: suppose that Toyota&#x27;s code did not contain any &quot;spaghetti&quot; or global variables. Suppose in fact that it was beautiful enough to make angels weep tears of joy. Would that make the slightest fucking difference, pardon my Japanese, when you start flipping bits in the task table? Of course fucking not.<p>His complaint amounts to amateur backseat engineering: you protected variables A and B from corruption by having multiple copies, so why not C? Your watchdog will restart tasks X and Y when they die, so why not Z? And so on. Which is an OK suggestion for the future, but how are they liable for something for not making an already extremely safe system slightly safer, when it&#x27;s much safer than previous systems, and has a  fantastically reliable backup?",1433257122

9646168,comment,9645403,9645925,0,0,furyg3,,,"This is what I came here to say.  Poverty is a resource allocation problem that is judged relatively.  As living standards increase, the subjective &#x27;poverty&#x27; perception also moves.  The inverse is also true: when living standards decrease (say due to a war or disaster) the conception of poverty will also adjust.  Additionally, a country cannot be expected to solve it&#x27;s &#x27;poverty&#x27; problem in the entire country is pretty equally in poverty.  The resources simply do not exist to be allocated.<p>So the proper way to judge subjective poverty is by income equality (a ratio of the richest X% to the poorest X%) within a country.  If inequality is very high and there is still subjective poverty in the country, that country&#x27;s government is not taking poverty seriously... do not believe them, they have the resources!  Any external help that is not advisory is essentially subsidizing the rich of that country; instead if we want to support those in poverty we should sanction that government until they act appropriately.<p>If inequality is very low in the country and subjective poverty exists, you can make an excellent case for external aid.  Countries in this situation may be victims of war (Afghanistan), failed states, or so small/remote that they may not have the resources to take care of themselves.<p>This is a difficult mirror to hold up, however, as there are many developed countries that have high inequality scores.",1433256275

I don&#x27;t.<p>Uncertainty over what adaption means serves their purposes. Uncertainty about the legality of taking somebody else&#x27;s code and just relicensing it as GPL also serves their purpose. As does uncertainly over what results in a combined or derivative work with GPL binaries. The more solidly those lines are drawn then the less risk people face when calling GPL code from GPL incompatible code. That means people are more likely to do all the kinds of things that RMS fears (e.g. proprietary IDEs that call out to gcc and all that kind of thing, which RMS was talking about recently in relation to emacs interfacing with gcc).<p>The problem they face is that ultimately they can&#x27;t create a license that prevents interoperation with proprietary code without also violating freedom zero. The only real way they have to discourage people from doing that is legal uncertainty. That is why it&#x27;s very difficult to get a straight answer from the FSF or SFLC about what constitutes a combined work (other than them just claiming everything in the world is a combined work, which is the usual nonsense reply you will get). If they answer the question then it&#x27;s them flagging up the best way to get around the GPL.<p>For example the FSF claim that distributing FooApp that links to a user chosen library at runtime and calls frobulate() requires FooApp to be GPL licensed, even if the developer of FooApp doesn&#x27;t distribute the library with the app (or at all), so long as there exists a library implementing frobulate() that is GPL licensed. If you really press them on this point then they will argue that it depends if other non-GPL libraries also implement frobulate(). Of course that creates a large loophole - just create a very basic crappy implementation of the API and make it available, with the expectation that users will actually use the superior GPL library. So it&#x27;s worth noting that the FSF doesn&#x27;t actually accept that argument when it comes the readline and editline. Distributing a binary containing the symbols for the readline API [2] is a GPL violation as far as they are concerned. Yet they have not taken anybody to court over this yet even though the FSF owns the copyright for readline.<p>You can easily find people with quite different views on what the linking clauses in the GPL mean[3], so it&#x27;s clear that there is a great deal of confusion out there. Nobody really knows what it means till it gets tested in court and the FSF have no interest in getting this cleared up because there is a non-zero chance that the courts don&#x27;t agree with the FSF&#x27;s interpretation of title 17. Once the red line is drawn over what is and isn&#x27;t a combined work then people will be free to work around the GPL with minimal legal risk.<p>That much legal uncertainty is not the sign of a well written license, if you think the aim of a license is to clearly enumerate what rights people have. If you think a software license is a political weapon then you probably don&#x27;t care that some people are being scared away from doing things they have a legal right to do with your code (but that you don&#x27;t like).<p>[1] <a href=""http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-misc&m=118963284332223"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-misc&m=118963284332223</a><p>[2] e.g <a href=""http://tuomov.bitcheese.net/b/archives/2005/12/23/T22_53_01"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tuomov.bitcheese.net/b/archives/2005/12/23/T22_53_01</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1877926"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1877926</a>",1433256071

It&#x27;s too easy for the student to get confused with all the tools and spend less time on the actual matter at hand.<p>When learning assembly, what matters is getting used to instructions, registers, control flow and explicit memory accesses rather than statements, expressions, functions and variables. It really doesn&#x27;t matter which ISA you&#x27;re learning, the actual skill you learn is how to read the documentation of a CPU architecture and tools to write and debug assembly code.<p>> It also suffers from nonstandardisation of the vector instructions like ARM does, although you can reasonably assume FPU and MMX these days.<p>This is not correct. ARM has at least 7 different FPU ISAs: 5 versions of VFP and 2 versions of NEON. I have devices at hand with three different float units (all consumer devices). In x86 world you can rely on SSE2 safely, it&#x27;s been around since Pentium 4 (1999) and is required on all 64 bit architectures (by contrast, NEON is rather new). But this is kind of a moot point since introductory assembly courses don&#x27;t go too deep on floating point units anyway.<p>Additionally, in the ARM world, there&#x27;s several revisions of the ISA/architecture being used, ARMv7 (32bit) and ARMv8 (64bit) and a dozen different variants for embedded products. And two different instruction encodings (thumb). It&#x27;s not at all less confusing.<p>> AMD64 might be an interesting choice to start with these days.<p>For basic user space programming it probably doesn&#x27;t make a difference but for bare metal/kernel programming, the AMD64 architecture is more, not less, confusing than the x86_32.<p>But in my opinion, it really doesn&#x27;t matter what you learn first. The details of the ISA itself is of secondary importance, understanding how to read the documentation of the architecture and getting some hands on experience is way more important.",1433255884

They have diverted from industry standards when the current off-the-shelf components did not necessarily meet their design desires/criteria.<p>I&#x27;m guessing that they found a pretty decent strategy when thunderbolt took on the mini-dp port and added thunderbolt to the mini-dp connector.  Sure there&#x27;s some confusion in plugging thunderbolt into a mini-dp port, but as Apple was concerned, they were not taking away any functionality, but merely just adding the thunderbolt feature to an existing port.<p>Apple&#x27;s potential adoption of Thunderbolt using the Type-C connector would be a similar strategy to the mini-dp/thunderbolt strategy.  This finally allows them to unify ports on their whole line up macbook/pro/iphone/ipad/atv/accessories/power/displays, which with their scale would probably translate to a pretty massive reduction in cost for maintaining inventory of the many assortments of ports and manufacturing.<p>Based on the direction they&#x27;ve taken with the new Macbook and this announcement, It&#x27;s pretty obvious that this is the direction they would like to go with and lays out the foundation for the expansion of the retina iMac into a retina thunderbolt display.<p>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s definitely more of a feature than it is a regression.  The world of consumers has shown that it&#x27;s been able to cope with USB 1 -> 1.1 -> 2 -> 3, with very little pain. For most people it will be the Type-C connector running at speeds varying from 12Mbps, 480Mbps, 10Gbps, 40Gbps...  If you have the higher speed, you can supper everything below it (kind of like 10G/40G ethernet). Mac&#x27;s will probably be sold with 40Gb Type-C ports, iPhones with 480Mb Type-C ports, Retina displays with 40Gb Type-C ports, all with the consumer being none-the-wiser as to whether they are running in USB mode or Thunderbolt mode.",1433255832

I would argue that IEC 61508 would have been the best model to follow in lieu of something more specific (especially since IEC 26262 is an adaptation of it), but I don&#x27;t think even 61508 existed at the time outside of a draft.  Ada was around, but it was a different beast than it is now and the tooling wasn&#x27;t very good at the time (my opinion).  I can&#x27;t think of many that were using Ada outside of the government mandate.<p>For general consumer products (i.e., outside of aviation and military), I&#x27;m having trouble thinking of industry standards for mission- and safety-critical electronic systems that existed at the time that Toyota&#x27;s electronic throttle system was developed.  Maybe SAE had something at the time?  A cursory Google search didn&#x27;t pull up anything.<p>> Whether you accept that multiple independent experts in safety critical programming are right or not is up to you however the stuff that came out of the trial painted a very clear picture to me of just how bad this software is.<p>To clarify, I&#x27;m not saying that the software isn&#x27;t poorly written by modern standards, but I am questioning that it was uniquely poor relative to the rest of the industry at the time it was developed.  That said, Toyota was/is arrogant, and ignoring their own processes and requirements at the time is unquestionably the wrong thing to do.  I remain skeptical that the software component was responsible for the unintended acceleration issues.<p>> A cynical person might consider that if Toyota is this poor how many other manufacturers are also as bad.<p>Isn&#x27;t the null hypothesis that they were all equally bad?",1433255195

Since then I&#x27;ve been on bail with the condition that I&#x27;m not allowed to be unsupervised with anyone under the age of sixteen, which when you have a one year old son is inconvenient to say the least - there was a short time when it seemed a real possibility that he may be taken into care because social services didn&#x27;t like that my wife believes I&#x27;m innocent. It also cost us hundreds of pounds in buying new laptops to use for work while we wait for our existing ones to be returned.<p>Thankfully the investigation is coming to an end now (in fact I got a call this morning to say the remaining two computers are going to be returned tomorrow), and it looks like everything is going to be ok. I&#x27;ve spent the last few months worrying that maybe one of our computers has also been used as a server.<p>To come vaguely back on topic, find a better way to get at TV you want to watch, because no amount of Game of Thrones is worth months of worrying whether the next knock at the door is going to be the police come to take you off to jail.",1433253624

With using more standard components we are able to be on site at either our primary or secondary datacenter within 30 minutes with spare parts in hand if required.<p>Choosing one vendor as an example, the support we&#x27;ve received from HP has been atrocious - they&#x27;ve caused more outages than they&#x27;ve be able to fix. The engineers they send to smaller organisations are generally relatively incompetent and they have certainly shown that they don&#x27;t care about your uptime.<p>Proprietary storage systems offered by HP, DELL and EMC are not only expensive to purchase and license but they&#x27;re very time consuming to manage as they&#x27;re essentially a &#x27;snowflake&#x27; in your infrastructure. It&#x27;s hard to make them integrate with modern automation tools such as Puppet and CI requirements and they all use their own management tools that are specific to the vendor or range of product - usually this involves having a Windows VM running Java or some equally frustrating technology to manage the system. Performing updates on proprietary systems can often be painful as hardware vendors generally are not very good at designing software.<p>It&#x27;s very hard to outsource quality and it comes at a large cost.",1428360765

9331163,comment,9328828,9330928,0,0,jodok,,,"full disclosure. i&#x27;m one of the co-founders of crate :)<p>In December 2010 we found about Elasticsearch and were truly amazed by it&#x27;s simplicity, speed and elegance. We built our service and consultancy business around it.<p>In 2011 we&#x27;ve built some of the largest ES applications at that time (6TB, 120node cluster, <a href=""http://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/sessions/you-know-search-querying-24-billion-records-900ms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://2012.berlinbuzzwords.de/sessions/you-know-search-quer...</a>) and started to develop a set of plugins, such as the in-out-plugin to allow distributed dump/restore.<p>With this background - and the mission to build a datastore that is as easy to use and administer as Elasticsearch we founded in 2013 Crate and raised some Seed money. Since that we&#x27;re working hard to make this vision become true.\nWe&#x27;re often confronted with the results of the so-called Jepsen-Test (<a href=""https://aphyr.com/posts/317-call-me-maybe-elasticsearch"" rel=""nofollow"">https://aphyr.com/posts/317-call-me-maybe-elasticsearch</a>) that Aphyr published in 2014. Don&#x27;t forget: Lucene, Netty, Elasticsearch, Crate - all are Open Source products (APL) and rely on all kinds of contributions - such as this analysis! No matter be it bad news or good news. We can only improve based on hard testing and feedback.\nHowever, this caused a lot of rumblings in the Elasticsearch ecosystem and the reaction of Elasticsearch was exemplary:<p>1) explain the reasoning and make an official statement: <a href=""https://www.elastic.co/blog/resiliency-elasticsearch/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.elastic.co/blog/resiliency-elasticsearch/</a><p>2) list all the issues and hunt them down. one by one: <a href=""http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/resiliency/current/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/resiliency/curr...</a> (and add new ones as they occur).<p>3) stay in contact with the community that reported the issues: <a href=""https://twitter.com/aphyr/status/525712547911974913"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/aphyr/status/525712547911974913</a><p>All that being said. We see many people using Crate as primary store (and of course backing up their data) but we also see people that don&#x27;t put that much trust in a younger database and keep all their primary data in another location and sync/index to Crate.<p>ALWAYS make backups (COPY TO / COPY FROM), make sure you have replicas, and most important configure minimum_master_nodes correctly to avoid split brain.<p>At Crate we stand on the shoulders of these great Open Source project, try to be as good citizens as possible and focus mainly on our Query engine (Analyzer, Planner, Execution Engine).",1428360713

9331161,comment,9329138,9330021,0,0,jronald,,,"My statement regarding approval was referencing the article: &quot;The artists admit that Snowden probably wouldn’t approve of the project, since he never wanted the leaks to be about him, but they hope he’d understand why they did it.&quot;<p>Considering it was intended to be a temporary art installation, the MIT Hacks reference seems appropriate: &quot; It is a traditional courtesy to leave a note or even engineering drawings behind, as an aid to safe de-installation of a hack.&quot;-nightworks<p>The difference is that this was intended to be temporary and decisions were made to ensure safe removal, which I appreciate, but no instructions were left to a staff, possibly unfamiliar with the removal procedures, leading to risk of damage to the monument.<p>I also think it unfair to assume the victims for which the memorial was for would believe this is a valid usage - while the theme is close, the artists are equating Prisoners of War losing their life in a situation they had no control over ( at that point), versus a situation very much in the hands of snowden (ignoring the injustices, there are and have been many decision open to him). Having researched a bit more, equating the situation of a single person, to the thousands (~11,500) who were effectively murdered due to the inhumane conditions of their captivity is distasteful at best.<p>This is an opinion I know, and I appreciate this is a civil conversation if unpopular.

To reiterate, this isn&#x27;t some small-time debate about whether &quot;leaking confidential files&quot; is &quot;legal&quot; or not, but rather a debate about whether the public has the right to know what the government is doing. The public does, in fact, have a right to know what the government is doing in their name. Snowden and whistleblowers need to exist in the current configuration of the government, which favors secrecy because they fear the public&#x27;s reaction to their bad deeds.<p>One last try: Snowden leaked information which tells us that the NSA effectively has the power to blackmail anyone in the US or elsewhere. Via whistleblower Russ Tice we know that the NSA was spying on Obama starting from 2004. Anything Obama has done, the NSA has known. Doesn&#x27;t that seem like it creates an avenue for major abuse?<p>This sure seems like a backdoor to democracy which would justify letting the members of the democracy know, right?

9331083,comment,9325687,9327156,0,0,ChristopherM,,,"I have never been asked to do a technical interview before being offered a gig.  They ask about my experience, from there they tell me about the problem they need solved.  So far I&#x27;ve always been familiar with their problem, I will immediately follow up with a high level description of how I will solve their problem (this is during the meeting and without doing research).<p>For example my most recent gig, the client, a start-up, had a product already in the field.  However for development and manufacturing testing they did not have any tools to test the device.  They wanted a tool to manually control the device, if possible they wanted a custom script environment added, and they had some device driver issues.  Because they already had working code for all of the functionality of the device I explained that I could port the existing code over to the test application.  Based on the scripting requirement I recommended using IronPython, Scintilla .net for a nice context highlighting text edit interface, and for their device driver problem it was a matter of walking the device driver stack to make sure the intended device was selected as they had multiple identical devices attached.  The hardest part was that the device was written in C++, but they wanted the tool written in C# using .NET.  So I had to translate the working device while I was creating the tool.  They did not question my ability after I quickly followed their explanation of what the device was, how it worked and what they wanted.  Within a couple of days they emailed me a contract, and about a week later they shipped their hardware as I work from home and in another state.<p>I have turned down gigs because I don&#x27;t &quot;work&quot; in California, I refuse to pay the ridiculous taxes and deal with all the paperwork.  I live in Nevada where there are no state income taxes, one less headache to worry about.  Telephone, email and Skype are all that are required to communicate.<p>As for doing a technical interview?  If asked I would never do one, I am a professional.  No one asks a Lawyer to solve some legal problems and write example contracts, no one asks a doctor to do some sample examinations and provide a written diagnosis.  I have references, I will talk about past work as long as I am not giving away any confidential information.  If that is not good enough than I don&#x27;t need to waste my time with the client.  They are free at any time to have me stop working for them if they are not satisfied, considering that recruiters charge 15-20% of a years salary to bring someone on board it&#x27;s quite a bit cheaper to have me do some work and decide I&#x27;m not living up to their expectations (that&#x27;s never happened).",1428359437

Google would argue their business choices, like shutting down someone&#x27;s wallet account (with money in it), falls into a similar category of business discretion - rather than being criminal.<p>This is why almost all of what the SEC does is civil enforcement, fines, etc. In business there are almost always cases of financial loss due to ignorance, incompetence, discretion, risk taking and so on - most of that is not properly going to be criminal, but rather civil.<p>Were Google doing something inappropriate in an area involving business discretion, the government may decide it&#x27;s not ok, but not criminal (eg lacking the <i>intention</i> to defraud). In that case, they&#x27;ll typically try to put a stop to the behavior, and use fines to do so.

But then Docker released their own orchestration strategy and that started the current period we&#x27;re in where both companies have come off as being very unprofessional and concerned only with their own future success.<p>Between Docker trying to build almost everything into the actual Docker executable (it&#x27;s a container runner, API server, build tool, process monitor, cloud provisioner and orchestration tool...those last two are only not the case because they got called on the strategy) and CoreOS&#x27;s pointless pushing of rkt (rkt itself isn&#x27;t pointless, but the PR to add rkt support to Docker was, as was implementing Docker support in rkt). Both sides have foolishly put their own interests ahead of the container ecosystem.<p>To say that either of the two companies has been the bad actor in all the drama would be biased. They&#x27;ve both come across like spoiled little children trying to get their way. As someone who has been pushing my company (~8000 employees) to consider implementing a containerized deployment strategy, it&#x27;s been hugely inconvenient to have to concede to people arguing against containerization all the points around how unprofessional the companies in the space have been, both in behavior and coding practices.",1428359102

9330975,comment,9328921,9329641,0,0,Daiz,,,">With that said, I have to ask why these groups are interested in 10-bit<p>I can explain that - I wrote an extensive post on this matter a year back, so I&#x27;ll just reuse that with a bit of tweaking. So with that clear, let&#x27;s talk about the medium we&#x27;re working with a bit first.<p>Banding is the most common issue with anime. Smooth color surfaces are aplenty, and consumer products (DVDs/BDs) made by &quot;professionals&quot; have a long history of terrible mastering (and then there&#x27;s companies like QTEC that take terrible mastering to eleven with their ridiculous overfiltering). As such, the fansubbing scene has a long history with video processing in an effort to increase the perceived quality by fixing the various source issues.<p>This naturally includes debanding. However, due to the large smooth color surfaces, you pretty much always need to use dithering in order to have truly smooth-looking gradients in 8-bit. And since dithering is essentially noise to the encoder, preserving fine dither and not having the H.264 encoder introduce additional banding at the encoding stage meant that you&#x27;d have to throw a lot of extra bitrate at it. But we&#x27;re talking about digital download end products here, with bitrates usually varying between 1-4 Mbps for TV 720p stuff and 2-12 Mbps for BD 720p/1080p stuff, not encodes for Blu-ray discs where the video bitrate is around 30-40 Mbps.<p>Because of the whole &quot;digital download end products&quot; thing, banding was still the most common issue with anime encodes back when everyone was doing 8-bit video, and people did a whole bunch of tricks to try to minimize it, like overlaying masked static grain on top of the video (a trick I used to use myself, and incidentally is something I&#x27;ve later seen used in professional BDs as well - though they seem to have forgot to properly deband it first). These tricks worked to a degree, but usually came with a cost in picture quality (not everyone liked the look of the overlaid static grain, for example). Alternatively, the videos just had banding, and that was it.<p>Over the years, our video processing tools got increasingly sophisticated. Nowadays the most used debanding solutions all work in 16-bit, and you can do a whole bunch of other filtering in 16-bit too. Which is nice and all, but ultimately, you had to dither it down to 8-bit and encode it, at which point you ran into the issue of gradient preservation once again.<p>Enter 10-bit encoding: With the extra two bits per channel, encoding smooth gradients suddenly got a lot easier. You could pass the 16-bit debanded video to the encoder and get nice and smooth gradients at much lower bitrates than what you&#x27;d need to have smooth dithered gradients with 8-bit. With the increased precision, truncation errors are also reduced and compression efficiency is increased (despite the extra two bits), so ultimately, if you&#x27;re encoding at the same bitrate and settings using 8-bit and 10-bit, the latter will give you smoother gradients and more detail, and you don&#x27;t really need to do any kind of processing tricks to preserve gradients anymore. Which is pretty great!<p>Now, obviously most people don&#x27;t have 10-bit screens or so, so dithering the video down to 8-bit is still required at some point. However, with 10-bit, this job is moved from the encoder to the end-user, which is a much nicer scenario, since you don&#x27;t need to throw a ton of bitrate for preserving the dithering in the actual encode anymore. The end result is that the video looks like such an encode on a 8-bit (or lower) screen, but without the whole &quot;ton of bitrate&quot; actually being required.<p>So the bottom line is that even with 8-bit sources and 8-bit (or lower) consumer displays, 10-bit encoding provides notable benefits, especially for anime. And since anime encoders generally don&#x27;t give a toss about hardware decoder compatibility (because hardware players are generally terrible with the advanced subtitles that fansubbers have used for a long time), there really was no reason <i>not</i> to switch.",1428358173

I generally put up small one off projects where I implement an idea I&#x27;m interested in, as opposed to long-term libraries or applications that are intended to be used by others. For the longest time I wasn&#x27;t technically skilled enough to contribute to other people&#x27;s code, but now I think it&#x27;s more about a lack of time and interest for me. I&#x27;ll definitely make a deliberate effort to collaborate and work on other people&#x27;s projects going forward. I&#x27;m curious to know though, what do you mean when you say that I &quot;show an understanding of some important concepts in [my] work&quot;?",1428357684

I gave up, but I realized I had not scratched the surface: rock music, pop songs, American songs, African songs, French songs, classical music, etc. I&#x27;d guess if I tried for a few days I&#x27;d come up with 3,000 names.<p>Then I started thinking of all the people I knew who had something to do with computer programming. I allowed myself nicknames like &quot;Matz&quot; because I can not remember Yukihiro Matsumoto. I know a lot of the famous ones: Guy Steele, McCarthy, Edsger Dijkstra, Rich Hickey, Paul Graham, etc. I also thought about all the tech bloggers I read, which is a huge number. I&#x27;ve got over 300 tech blogs in my RSS feed reader.<p>Again, I got to almost 1,000 and quit, but I realized I knew a lot more, easily 2,000, maybe even 3,000.<p>Then I did the same with favorite writers, and I got 540 names without trying too hard.<p>Then I started with actors and actresses and directors. I got over 400 without too much effort. I think if I devoted a few hours to it, I would get more than 1,000, maybe 1,500, or even 2,000.<p>Then I started listing people I&#x27;ve known during my life. I allowed myself to describe people who I knew 20 years ago, who I remember clearly though I don&#x27;t always remember their names. I got over 2,000 during about 90 minutes of trying. I think if I devoted a whole day to it, I might be able to double that number.<p>Then I allowed myself to write down every fictional character I knew, from Hamlet to Bilbo Baggins to Wolverine. I got well over 2,000 names with maybe an hour&#x27;s effort.<p>What I learned from this experiment is that I must know of well over 20,000 people. I might know 50,000 people, counting both fictional and non-fictional people.<p>That, to me, says a lot about what humans do with the extra brain matter they have, relative to apes.",1428357662

8171617,comment,8169591,8170622,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"What I find astonishing though is how the artists did not intend or even anticipate any of what you describe (if they&#x27;re telling the truth). And that, I think, is not a sign of any transatlantic cultural gap. It&#x27;s an intellectual failure on the part of the artists.<p>Artists are supposed to be experts in symbolism and perception. In my view, what makes some art interesting is the tension between expectations and perception. To play with that, you have to be aware of the way in which your art will be perceived by others.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that artists should never be surprised. But how can anyone be surprised about a white flag being interpreted as a sign of surrender? How can anyone be surprised that any modification of a nation&#x27;s flag will be seen by some as malevolent defacement and an attack on that nation?<p>I&#x27;m not saying it shouldn&#x27;t be done. I&#x27;m just saying that &quot;oops, we never thought this could be seen as anti-american&quot; is an embarrassing statement to make if it comes from artists whose art is meant to be seen by the general public as opposed to some small circle of insiders visiting a gallery.",1407909400

8171611,comment,8168611,8170149,1,0,fred_durst,,,"Can you try at least for one or two comments to dial down the snark. Seriously, I don&#x27;t live in the Bay Area anymore so my tolerance for it is pretty low these days.<p>Anyhow, it&#x27;s not a threshold business. The idea that there will eventually be a &quot;number of drivers&quot; that is too high is without any case study of modern business I can recall. Maybe you can enlighten me on some examples(see I can do that passive aggressive snark too!). I can&#x27;t remember a single instance of over supply that destroyed the market maker&#x27;s position. Sure many in the supply side(drivers in this case) lose their shirts, but the market makers typically do very well. The network is drivers and riders. Just like a dating site as a matchmaker. We all know that is lead by female adoption. Same analogue of driver adoption. Once you have enough network on the supply side you end up with a dominant share of the demand side which comes back around and gives you leverage over the supply pricing. That&#x27;s where the profit happens.<p>Maybe you should dial down both the snark and idealism and read up on the historical business fundamentals at play.<p>For example, explain to me the several periods where eBay increased its margins to the determent of sellers and did not lose its dominant market position. Or 1 degree of separation, explain how PayPal continues to dominate.",1407909331

Admit to yourself that the first time you design/implement a system you will most likely get a lot of things wrong. Get a proof of concept out there, and try to learn from it. The second time you design that system you will probably try to incorporate everything you know and are prone to overengineering and feature bloat (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect</a>).

You can build a &#x27;next hop&#x27; appliance with an FPGA and a couple of DDR3 chips such that any 32 bit number input would return the next hop in 130ns after loading. It would be straight forward to create command port that took a network + netmask and filled in all the next hop info for every host on that network.

We take these fonts for granted, but it&#x27;s amazing just how much consideration goes into these things. I have so much respect for talented designers like Jakob Runge. I think it&#x27;s a rarity that someone has the design chops to know what he or she wants, execute the design on paper, be able to write hours of boring repetitive code in OpenType to get the kerning or ligatures just right, and then make sure that each cultural differences are properly accounted for...<p>As a musician, it&#x27;s very inspiring when someone pours so much of their personality and time into crafting such masterpieces. Say what you will about the font, but it&#x27;s coherent and shows you a complete aesthetic world of its own. Beethoven&#x27;s symphonies may have taken longer to write, and it may have been more difficult, but the love I see from Runge into crafting something that at the end of the day can be replaced by Times New Roman, is amazing and frankly, comparable to Beethoven&#x27;s.<p>So much respect.",1407908473

[1]<p>Your confusion likely stem from the fact that metric-TSP (a special case of TSP problem where the distance between cities form a metric [2]) is actually APX-complete, which means it can be approximated to a constant factor in polynomial time (Christofides algorithm, approx ratio = 1.5).<p>PS: A potentially interesting aside - Sanjeev Arora, the PhD advisor of Subhash Khot actually got his first Gödel prize (2001) for discovering a PTAS (polynomial time approximation scheme, which in layman term means you can approximate it as close to real answer (but not exactly) as you like in polynomial time) for Euclidean-TSP (independently discovered by Joseph S. B. Mitchell as well).

The uniform-height numerals are basically the “upper case” variants, which should typically only be used when typesetting numerals in the middle of text in all caps, tables of pure numbers, mathematical formulas, or the like.<p>When you have a paragraph of regular words, set in lower case, a “capitalized” number is very visually heavy and distracting, unbalancing the flow of the text.<p>At some point in the relatively recent past uniform-height numbers started to become the norm, I suspect largely because of typewriters and then early computers. (It hasn’t been until relatively recently (e.g. with OpenType) that software could easily set numerals in both the lowercase and uppercase versions. In the 90s, most high-quality commercial typefaces sold separate “pro” fonts which had small caps, old-style numerals, extra ligatures, etc., and the typesetter had to explicitly select the relevant characters and change the font to get those features, instead of just setting a feature flag for a whole text block.)",1407907586

[1]<p>So given that the highest court has allowed the ruling to stand in a large circuit, yet has consistently expanded the first-sale doctrine for four decades [2], the precedent is unclear.<p>Cisco does rely on <i>Vernor</i> and its progeny as it&#x27;s justification for blacklisting resold items. But that argument is unlikely to hold water outside of the software-laden 9th Circuit.<p>The question, stated in layman&#x27;s terms, is, &quot;To which is a Cisco router or switch more similar, a copy of Windows or an iPod?&quot; This is an open question from a legal standpoint, and thus we must unfortunately resort to that most unreliable of legal tools: reason.<p>Both options are almost equally unpalatable to the Supreme Court for policy reasons. Expand the shrink-wrap exception to cover Cisco and you risk encompassing all products that contain firmware, from TVs to microwaves, and thus strangling the half-trillion dollar secondary sale market for electronic goods. Keep the exception narrow and you choke off the single largest source of revenue (all told, including gains from new purchases, maintenance contracts, and paid software updates close to $20 Billion, or 40% of annual revenue) to the government&#x27;s largest IT hardware provider (over 85% of DoD in particular), leaving the government stranded with vast networks of legacy Cisco hardware with little to no new development from the company.<p>The existing legal precedent creates a tough needle for the Court to thread. As a result, we have the current state of limbo, and thus discussion of &quot;grey markets,&quot; which are neither clearly legal nor clearly illegal.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine</a>\n[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernor_v._Autodesk,_Inc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernor_v._Autodesk,_Inc</a>.\n[2] Most recently in Kirtsaeng v.

You can possibly add additional hypothesis which rescue it (I suggested one in the post you just responded to), but that doesn&#x27;t mean the original hypothesis by itself isn&#x27;t poor.<p><i>what is the most significant difference between doctors and engineers? Obviously: distribution among genders in medicine is much more balanced than in technology.</i><p>The key word here is &quot;is&quot;. This was not true in the past. Yet somehow, medicine attracted women but tech didn&#x27;t. At this historical point, did boy doctors not ask out girl doctors, but boy programmers did ask out girl programmers? Same for law, etc? Your &quot;minority + asked out&quot; theory predicts women can never escape minority status, which is evidently false.<p>If you want an explanation it needs to be specific to computing.<p><i>Have you not talked to one who was shaken by being hit on by a guy in a work setting? I am not the suave, athletic bachelor you obviously are...</i><p>I&#x27;ve heard this story before. I&#x27;ve heard of women being hit on in church gatherings also, yet church is full of women.

I would donate to that organization.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of horseshit patents asserted against start-ups.  If there was an organization that followed the troll around and offered defense services against all of their defendants, it would make trolling a lot harder, and might reduce the numbers of these parasitic lawyers involved in this shameless trade.<p>I just read about a Fish & Richardson patent partner who started filing his own &quot;inventions&quot; with the patent office, based on slight modifications of the patents he was filing for clients, and then sold those patents to trolls for huge sums.  Its actually really easy to write patents focused on sabotaging your clients, if you are a lawyer and become familiar with their future roadmaps.<p>I know a bunch of trivial claims I could write right now and they would be worth a few million in a couple years, because Google, Facebook, and others would have to move in that direction in a few years (related to Machine Learning and image recognition).<p>All you have to do is follow conferences, understand the papers, and then write some trivial, and obvious evolutions of those techniques.  Obviousness is something defendant&#x27;s find extremely difficult to prove for highly complex technology, because the juries are made of people that have no idea what programming is, much less Machine Learning, and the judge is probably some moron, that thinks he is really smart, and assumes that he patent office is full of diligent geniuses ... and so he will give a lot of weight to the plaintiff&#x27;s &quot;USPTO certified&quot; claims.<p>All it takes is for a programmer to be involved in one patent litigation and you see the patent system for what it is.  A colossal system of giant, continuous, expensive injustice implemented in the hope of preventing an extremely rare form of injustice (when a true original inventor is cheated by a shameless larger company).<p>Imagine we institute an expensive system of highly trained commandos to follow every nerd in America around in high schools across the country, to protect them from bullying and to be their friends.  It would certainly stop all physical bullying.  But would it be worth the giant overhead/expense?<p>That is what we have to start asking ourselves.  Even if the patent system prevents some rare injustices, WTF, is this continuous, and overwhelming cloud of uncertainty for every start-up and company worth it?<p>I feel like China and India are doing quite alright without overburdensome strong patent protection.  And Europe seems fine with a hamstrung software patent system.  And even in the US, Microsoft, Oracle, Adobe, IBM, and Apple got their start before software became patentable ... and they all did, and are doing fine.<p>If you see someone arguing for patents, they are almost always some fucking lawyer, troll, or someone sitting on a giant portfolio.  The people actually making software every day don&#x27;t want this shit system.  VCs that fund start-ups, don&#x27;t want it ... even though you would expect they want it, to protect their investments.",1407906498

Mothers show a gender bias towards their daughters, whereas middle-age men don't appear to have a gender bias.<p>Figure 1a (best friend) is basically symmetrical: gender bias of the best friend is opposite sex.  The bias peaks for women at 27 and for men at 32, gradually decreasing until the best friends for both are slightly female-biased in their 70s.<p>In Figure 1b (second-best friend), the 2nd-best friend for 20-something males is another male.  The bias gradually declines until by 40 his second-best friend is 50/50 male/female.<p>But for second-best friends, ""women show a striking reversal"" from same-sex to opposite-sex.  A 20-something female's 2nd-best friend is also female, but it strongly reverses towards males (peaking in her late 40s).<p>If my interpretation (of their interpretation) is correct, these graphs are showing that a female's best friend is initially her husband, but he is gradually replaced by her daughter:  ""the younger (25-year) peak for 50- year-old men is half that for women and shows a more even sex balance, whereas that for women is strongly biased in favour of female alters (presumably, daughters)"".  The husband, in turn, falls from 1st-best friend to 2nd-best friend (replacing the formerly female one).<p>""Finally, fourth, our results provide strong evidence for the importance of female matrilineal relationships in human social organisation. There has been a tendency to emphasise the importance of male-male relationships in an essentially patrilineal form of social organisation as defining human sociality [20], but our results tend to support the claim that mother-daughter relationships play a particularly seminal role in structuring human social relationships, as has been suggested by some sociological studies [21].""<p>EDIT: attempted to increase clarity.

I spent years refusing to play the game; preferring to stay strictly idealistic about ability and hard work paving the way. It got me nowhere fast as an entrepreneur. The minute I stopped fighting against how things actually work, success came calling.<p>I still don't like the notion that your connections can get you the right opportunities radically faster than your ability, but that will always be how the world works. Marc Andreessen would not be what he is today without Jim Clark (the gatekeeper).<p>People are social beings, and that's the root of the issue. The networks you form, give you radical advantages. Half of success, in my opinion, is your ability, work ethic and willingness to seize opportunity; the other half is who you know.<p>Most meaningful jackpots in life are guarded by gate keepers. If you want to succeed, far more often than not you're going to need help, and you're going to have to give someone else a cut of the action. Others are inclined to help you once you make them personally invested, that's obvious. People are also more inclined to trust and work with people in their networks - trust by established association. Works the same way with that little piece of paper, a degree, that gets you the stellar job.<p>Silicon Valley is supposedly a meritocracy. Try getting a meeting with, a contact with, a phone call with, or an email response from - Ron Conway (for example). I don't care how badass of an engineer you are.

It's great that I can host photos on my own storage and that the code is on github and that the API is well-documented and hey it got started on Kickstarter!<p>But where's the beef? What do I get in a tangible way for signing up? Which leads us into...<p>> Out of curiosity, did you ever (even think to) click on the ""Get Started"" links? Our goal was that end users would click that and then click the giant red button we put on that page. Not sure it's working though :).<p>Yeah, I got there pretty quickly, but I didn't want to sign up until I knew what I was signing up <i>for</i> in a concrete sense. Freedom, Peace-of-Mind if OpenPhoto goes away, etc, are all good and noble things, but I don't want to create an account until I can see tangibles: what do the galleries look like, and how do they feel to browse around in? What kinds of customizations are available? That's the sort of information I'd expect to find in your Overview page[1], but there's almost nothing concrete to be found there. <a href=""http://openphoto.me/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openphoto.me/</a> [2] is slightly better, once I was pointed to it, but only insofar as there are two tiny thumbnails which appear to show something of the user experience.<p>Flickr and 500px have sold me over the years because I could hit 'Explore' or 'Popular Photos' straight from their landing page and experience exactly what signing up would get me in terms of what the site feels like to use, what the community is like and how it functions, etc. One of my big concerns as a user of one of these sites boils down to: if I take photos of someone, and use this site to display the photos, and send links to that person, what will that person's experience be, and is that an experience I want to associate myself with?<p>Neither <a href=""http://theopenphotoproject.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theopenphotoproject.org/</a> nor <a href=""http://openphoto.me/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openphoto.me/</a> offer me a way to really answer that question for myself, so neither site makes me want to sign up, however nice hosting on my own back-end might sound.<p>[1] Incidentally, ""3) RELAX, ORGANIZE AND SHARE YOUR PHOTOS (REQUIRED)"" comes off to me as a lot more ominous than its probably intended. It sounds like it requires me to share all of my photos with the internet, privacy be damned. Maybe needs a rethink of the verbiage?<p>[2] The combo sign-up/request an invite form seems pretty confusing. After finally deciding from squinting at the thumbnails that I might want to at least click around inside, I started to fill it out before realizing I didn't have an invite, apparently required, and abandoned any thought of going further out of discouragement. Just my opinion, but I'd probably just have a request-an-invite form, and send invitees to a different private link via email. Realizing something is closed to me 3/4ths of the way through a form can be off-putting.<p>All suggestions in this post come from an engineer, not a UX expert. YMMV. Check local listings for details.

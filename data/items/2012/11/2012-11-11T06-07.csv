I don't understand. Are you proposing person.save is wrong and save should be abstracted?<p>> Ruby is my favorite language, but Active Record is one of the things I hold greatly against Rails, not only for AR itself, but for the inspiration it provided to many other Ruby ORM's, that while they may improve on various aspects still to a large extent also end up encouraging leaking implementation details for your models all over the place.<p>More rant. Still nothing concrete. AR maps the whole table, and if you are using AR, you should know that.

Their average response time via email was 57 minutes during recruitment. I just checked my old emails.<p>After my final round, I waited patiently ... and then waited some more. I emailed my recruiter, my ""buddy"" and my interviewers. I really was interested in working there but I had to make a decision on other  jobs. I told them that and they said someone will contact me. 6 weeks later, after I had already taken another job, a recruiter called me saying that I didn't get the job because I did not make their ""bar"" and a partner will call me with feedback. 3 years later and still no call.<p>I guess I should be happy that they did eventually contact me but it left a very bitter taste.<p>Fast forward to two months ago. I was in the position of finding a consulting company to help our hospital system with financial issues. 3 large hospitals. Multimillion dollar contract. McKinsey & Co.'s name came up a few times but my bad experience is what made me eventually recommend another company. One that I got rejected from after the first round but made me feel good. They gave me feedback and didn't make me feel like crap.<p>Most people claim that McKinsey has a great feedback system, but it failed in my experience and maybe that is what led to us choosing another consulting company.<p>It taught me a great lesson though.

My point is that there is much of what you and I do in our day to day development efforts that depends on the notion of ""I own a computer, and I run these tools on it, and I get these results."" And we can do that reasonably easily because even though our requirements are outside the mainstream (the target market as you put it) they are enabled because the piece work, the foundational stuff, <i>is</i> required for the target market, <i>for now.</i><p>My prediction, fear, belief, what have you, is that the bulk of the 'investment' in terms of time and energy and thought power, will become more and more focussed on that market and worry less and less about what you and I are trying to accomplish.<p>Here is a milestone which you can look for in order to measure progress toward that future. When you see a GCC release which supports a system or processor where the <i>only</i> way to use it initially is through a remote API to some remote server with source code on some network accessible repository. The rationale will be<p>""We didn't want to delay releasing it for all the ports to 'catch up', most people can use it like this, installable packages for local OS'es will be available in a few {days/weeks/months}.""<p>That is when you know that it has started changing 'faster' than people are willing to wait for the ports. Then the folks doing the ports will start to drop off because the number of people who use the port is dropping off because all the new kids just use the remote API anyway and you can do it from a command line as if it were running locally so why complain? But that milestone will tell you, to get the feature you want right now you have to use the remote version or wait for a port to come out. Here is a pointer to the source if you want to start porting it yourself.<p>Except the source will embed various network services which it can 'assume' are there, its the remote version after all, and you will have to code up an equivalent.<p>I've seen build systems like this, they are very powerful, I will buy you a beer and we can talk about the 'old days' when you could do development without having to be connected to the network. The kids will pity our backward ways. But the beer will be tasty as usual.",1352614304

6047311,comment,6045581,6045826,4,0,Laremere,,,"I think US&#x27;s opinions about public transportation is based on rational comparison.  Taking the bus takes more time than taking a car, and is a less desirable environment.  Our train system is optimized for freight, and has no cost or time benefit over just driving.  
Countries which have high amounts of public transportation tend to have higher gas prices and population density.  It becomes more cost and time effective in that case to take public transportation.  
If this hyper-tube system takes off, it could really be a game changer.  Even with a high cost, the transportation speed is really desirable, especially if you don&#x27;t need to go through the routine that you need to go through at airports before you even get on the plane.  If the cost becomes comparable or cheaper than airplanes, then it becomes cheaper and more convenient to take the hyper tube than driving or flying.  Americans understand the language of time and money, and that would change their opinion very quickly.",1373911055

Given the summaries for GPLv3 and AGPLv3 for example, somebody might think they have identical terms. The only additional information they give is a link to the license text (which is a terrible light grey font on white background). The original license text is what might be scary about licensing: because people struggle to read the legalese.<p>There needs to be a concise summary of how these licenses differ, one that they can comprehend without reading the whole license text. Website is a good idea, but IMO, needs a lot of work, and may even be harmful in it&#x27;s current state.<p>I&#x27;m also not sure why they promote the GPLv2 (without + clause) over the GPLv3 either. That may convince someone that people will always share their code, and doesn&#x27;t mention tivoization. Seems like a deliberate ploy from someone who dislikes the strong copyleft of GPLv3 family to prevent people using them.<p>I think an improvement would be to have multiple options and to filter down licenses until only a few remain: so eg, when I click &quot;I care about sharing improvements&quot; on the front page, it gives me another few options, like &quot;I want people to share their modifications for hosted websites&quot;, or &quot;I want people to be able to use in commercial apps&quot; - which would filter to AGPL and LGPL respectively.",1373910867

The majority (nix that...the good ones I know) want to make a difference in society and the world around them.  That being said, I&#x27;d love it if they were making more.<p>The socioeconomic ties can NOT be underplayed.  Give every kid in a poor section of town an ipad and I would guarantee you that some would be sold, a lot would get busted, etc.<p>OP stated that &quot;parents today are often left in the dark as to their childs progress&quot;.  This can be true.  A lot of parents I see also can not be bothered to lift a finger to check up on how their kids are doing.  As a part of the system, EVERY piece must be willing to step up.  Only if most of the parts are strong can the system deal with weakness in other components.<p>Let&#x27;s say a quarter of the parents are doing a crappy job.  The teachers of those students have to work extra hard to engage those kids.  Those kids have to work extra hard to push themselves.<p>Got some crappy teachers?  Then the parents and kids need to work extra hard.<p>tl;dr: it&#x27;s a complex system and every part must improve and take responsibility.",1373910335

First, it doesn&#x27;t seem like TFA is opposed to JS, as the linkbait title would seem, but the overhead of some sites/libraries.<p>I think that jQuery is probably a bit larger than it may need to be.  Most of this is to work around edge cases or missing features in supported browsers.  I think that the biggest issue may well be cost(s), and trust.  It would be entirely possible to have a jQuery-like framework that would bring in only those shims as needed as part of loading from a central source.  Unfortunately, that has costs in terms of both maintenance as well as deployment/cdn.  It&#x27;s probably not worth it.<p>Second, you are getting a lot of unused features with most frameworks (like jQuery), however this can be mitigated by using a common CDN, where caching helps a lot.  Using the google, or ms cdn for jquery is a no brainer for a public facing application.  I think that jQuery is too useful to just be replaced with one-off components.<p>As to jQueryUI, when you compare what it does with other toolkits, it&#x27;s actually very impressive.  Just look at the load size for the JS for Bootstrap for example... and bootstrap doesn&#x27;t do all that jQueryUI does.<p>More and more frameworks have checkbox build options to give more fine grained builds specific to your needs with less overhead.  Also, as pointed out in a few slides, you can load certain scripts and features as an on demand or post-load approach.<p>For example <i>ALL</i> my scripts tend to be at the bottom before the closing body tag (unless it&#x27;s a single page application).  Even then, the analytic scripts are last... imho the page being served to the user is the most important thing... it should be mostly functional without JS.  And in terms of scripts, in the larger sense analytics are pretty low pecking order... when you have 10k users an hour, missing 2-3 analytics loads is no big deal.",1373910077

Above that the amount of backstabbing and mean gossiping going around makes the places unbearable to work in. And this is not something I&#x27;ve seen only myself, as my female friends have independently made comments about this.<p>Of course, I encourage equal opportunities, but there are some weird social interactions depending on the group&#x27;s composition. This can be seen in male predominating places as well, which can be just as toxic (if not more) to somebody who doesn&#x27;t <i>look</i> like the rest.

You hire women that you <i>will</i> promote, because they are so much better at leading.<p>That being said, all generalisations are wrong. I&#x27;ve met women and men alike that have been backstabbing misanthropes, but believing that men and women are equals is like denying that Dutch people are tall, or that I&#x27;m not too short to reach the top drawer at my house. That&#x27;s why you have specialisation, I won&#x27;t play basketball and it is unlikely there is a Dutch jockey. If you are hiring and thinking from the beginning in terms of <i>men or women</i> you are missing the real value of that person, which may or may not align with your precognitions.<p>EDIT: got the joke wrong (first &quot;woman&quot; is &quot;man&quot;)",1373909296

This is why some people build HTML apps that look like some native app they had and say, &quot;this is too slow!&quot; However, there are some very bad anti-patterns that cause unnecessary reflows, and those can be avoided if you understand them.<p>For example, many infinite-scroll pages add a small amount of content to the DOM and then ask, &quot;Did I fill the page enough?&quot; by asking for the new height of the page. Each time they do that it requires a reflow where the browser recalculates the height of the page. When the added content is small it may take four or five trips through this loop to feed enough content into the page. A better alternative performance-wise would be to make each chunk of added content a fixed height. That way it&#x27;s easy to do the math inside your own code, add four or five chunks, and the browser will do a single reflow at the end.<p>If you look at the &quot;flat&quot; designs that are becoming common in operating systems and apps, they perform well in these situations because they are very regular and easy to compute.

The holes will be spaced so that the upward-pushing force decreases over the loop as the upward-pulling force increases.  This creates a slow acceleration at the beginning of the loop and a slow deceleration at the end of the loop.  Some mechanical system will move cars from the end of the loop to the beginning (since there is no air force there).  The speed at any given point is determined by how many of the up/down holes are behind/before the car, so speed in the center is incredibly fast.<p>The idea is pretty simple, it&#x27;s just a matter of getting enough funding for the execution since the entire system must be constructed before any returns.

The larger issue to me, is does this include the licenses/use of said hardware decoders?  Raspberry Pi doesn&#x27;t, and it&#x27;s a pita to use the actual hardware decoding for video.  This is of concern to me.<p>Another issue is that&#x27;s the base/lowest price?  There are already competing boards/kits that may be better priced than this is.  Once you add the cost for the faster (quad-core) cpu, and storage, how will this compare to an AMD ITX based solution?  Whenever I see a media solution like this, that&#x27;s always the path I go down.  When I&#x27;m going to actually spend more than $200 for a full version of an ARM solution, I tend to rethink that an ITX solution with an AMD board/APU seems like a better deal.<p>I honestly think it will take a bigger name to actually push a decent solution like this.  Apple TV hasn&#x27;t done too well here, and nothing else even comes close to that.  Roku and other media hubs are pretty limited, but effective.

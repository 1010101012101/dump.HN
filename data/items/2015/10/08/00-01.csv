However, you will quickly experience several challenges:<p>(1) Table scans to extract just a few columns will be extremely inefficient. It&#x27;s better to create one table per column, each being a pair [time, value].<p>(2) B-tree indexes will be inefficient you for large extracts. For example, aggregating by month for one year will basically not use the indexes. The index will only mostly useful for looking up individual metrics, which is not useful. The new BRIN indexes in 9.5 should help, however.<p>(3) You&#x27;ll end up reaching for something like Postgres&#x27; partitioned tables, which allows you to create child tables that are visible from the top-level table. Each table needs to be sharded by something like the current day, or week, or month.<p>(4) You say you need a proxy to batch data packets. So it&#x27;s queuing, and needs persistence because you don&#x27;t want to lose data if Postgres is lagging behind — your proxy is now a time series database! However, if Postgres is lagging behind, you have a problem. If you&#x27;re writing at 600k/s and Postgres can only handle 500k/s, you have a never-ending queue.<p>(5) PostgreSQL can only have one master, and its write capability has a fixed ceiling (for HDDs you can calculate the max possible tps from the rotational speed, not sure about SSDs). At some point you&#x27;ll end up sharding (by column, probably) the master into multiple concurrent masters.<p>Much of the point of something like InfluxDB is that there&#x27;s no single bottleneck. You scale linearly by adding more nodes, each of which can write data at top speed. You don&#x27;t need a &quot;proxy&quot; because it&#x27;s designed to perform that very same function.",1444264860

Attacking people for their views (for example, calling them a racist or down voting them to hell) is how you reinforce existing negative attitudes, not end them.<p>If you&#x27;ll indulge me, I&#x27;d like to present some anecdata. I remember entering into a comment thread on HN using a throwaway in which hacker culture was being attacked as being inherently misogynistic. The statements being espoused seemed extremely overblown based on my experience. It also seemed ridiculous to throw an entire culture under the bus because specific elements of it may be bad. When I voiced these opinions I was immediately attacked by someone who didn&#x27;t even know me, who implied that I was a misogynist by not agreeing with their position. This shifted the discussion away from being about ideas to being about my personal character, so my internal reaction was something along the lines of &quot;well fuck you and your stupid ideas then&quot; and I left the thread. Any chance for productive dialogue was immediately over, and I left with a highly negative view of feminism and a bias against feminists which I didn&#x27;t have when I entered the thread.<p>Fast forward a few months and I was hanging out with a good friend of mine who is a female developer. Sexism in the workplace somehow came up in conversation, and I again stated that the opinions being voiced by some of these women seemed like bullshit (using stronger terms than my first statement). She calmly said she could see how I would think so given my experience, but that it was indeed as bad as it sounded. We continued the conversation, and I came away with my mind changed. This would never have happened had she not engaged me in dialogue, and I would likely still harbor a subtle or overt bias against feminists to this day.",1444264838

That is why Perl doesn&#x27;t do exact arithmetic with large integers.<p>But, you say, Perl allows you to use bigint?  Well, yes.  And that is internally implemented with the magic of overload.  Using that you can have any number of types which overload + to do what they want, and you have all of the same issues as arose in the Wat talk.<p>It took a long time for me to be convinced, but I am now convinced that typed variables and untyped operators (like Ruby and Python do) is strictly better in practice than untyped variables and typed operators (like Perl does by default).  And as for the complexity, it is just something you have to live with.<p>Want evidence?  <a href=""https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/sicp/book/node48.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/sicp/book/node48.htm...</a> discussed this exact problem some 30 years ago.

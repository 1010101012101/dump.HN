If the gun manufacturer wants honey you can trade. If that direct trade doesn't work you could do some intermediate ones till you got to the gun and that is the same as just issuing money, just more difficult to do. Why do people like bartering so much? Money is a better solution for the same problem.<p><i>The fundamental concepts are really different ... previously owning $10 bill would mean that your bank stores an equivalent quantity in gold for you. Now $10 just means someone owes the bank $10 ... and it's really a useless piece of paper with an unrealistic value. That's really the reason behind an economic crisis.</i><p>All money is debt, be it gold or not. All it means for me to have $10 is that society has agreed to give me that amount of goods or services in return for giving it back. It is always a debt, if it is represented in gold, paper or a number in a computer. In the previous model where the bank held $10 worth of gold for your bill if you redeem the bill for the gold what can you do with it now? There are industrial and decorative purposes but for you as an individual, what good does it do?<p>I don't understand these arguments that gold is some kind of one-true-currency. The only thing having a gold standard does is set a fixed monetary policy. The monetary base cannot be expanded as the amount of gold is fixed. But the Fed could set the same policy without having to handle gold. Having the physical metal is just an implementation detail that used to be important but isn't anymore. If it's the monetary policy you don't like fight against that.<p>Putting value in gold also motivates people to go digging around looking for this largely useless metal. That in itself is a drag on the economy as those people could be doing something more productive with their time.",1257850710

That's pretty ambiguous and, as mentioned, you can't really put 100% trust in anything. Also, the meaning of 'the cloud' has become diluted, seeing it's now analogous with pretty much anything web based. We might as well call it ""scalable, distributed and virtualized computing"" or something.<p>The question, for me, comes down to education and understanding. The term 'the cloud' is relatively nascent, but the basic underlying principles are not really that new, just more evolved. The cloud is as secure and reliable as you make it. By definition it promotes redundancy, accessibility and scalability.<p>I work on a 'cloud' claims management application and it's targeted at the enterprise (finance/insurance) market, who are notoriously slow to adopt new technology. Trust me, it's a tough audience, but not as tough as you might think. The realization that data can be accessed (and work done) anywhere, at negligible cost with existing hardware is simply too compelling for any forward thinking company.<p>Quite simply, the pros seriously outweigh the cons - whereas the opposite is true for traditional client-server technology.",1257850144

932806,comment,932804,932804,0,0,swombat,,,"Reposting my comment from TC:<p>I’m not convinced that Premium (or even Freemium) works all that well for most consumer products. Sure, there’s a few home runs, but on the whole, the numbers are just very hard to squeeze any money out of.<p>10% is a very high conversion rate. Typically, any Freemium (or plain Premium) product will have somewhere around 1% conversion rate. Let’s say you do really well and bring in 100′000 new potential users every single month (quite an achievement for any website, I’d say). With a 1% conversion rate, that’s 1′000 new paying users a month.<p>Consumers, however, typically aren’t very keen on paying much more than a few dollars a month (when they’re willing to pay a subscription at all, which is rarely) – let’s say they’re ok with paying $60 a year. That’s $5 a month.<p>So with that insanely high amount of incoming users, you’ll have a cumulative income adding $5k a month. That’s assuming there’s no attrition (good luck with that). Not much to celebrate. At that rate, assuming no attrition, it would take you 20 months before you even make $100k/m. With attrition, it’s fair to assume that consumers won’t stay for even that long, so actually you’ll stabilise around $25-50k/m. This is not too shabby for a lifestyle business, but if you’ve taken €1m of funding, that’s not really an option. Then again, the funding wasn’t from VCs, so maybe that’s ok.<p>There are always exceptions, things that hit a sweet spot and make crazy amounts of money from consumers. But those are very few and very far between. Can you think of any?",1257849813

As I indicated, I think that the correct anchor for this pricing is ""HR expenditures"" (like payroll) not ""cheap web services anybody in the organization can start using on their own initiative as long as they have a credit card"".  (Why do I think that?  Because I think you need HR buy-in to sell any plan costing more than $20 / month, so you might as well charge them through the nose to let them know you're serious.)  However, I was focusing on the need for simplification in that point, so I picked price points that they demonstrated they'd be more or less comfortable with charging for my example.<p>I would be interested in hearing your reasons why the CALL option is ""not right"".  Here are my reasons why it is:<p>As it stands currently, they will not sell any plans whatsoever to companies with 100+ users.  Not a single one.  The reason is that when you get to 100+ users you have just won yourself a ticket aboard the USS Enterprise Sales.  There are now a few hundred obstacles standing in front of the sale where there weren't when you were selling to a man who routinely invites all his employees over for dinner.  If you haven't done Enterprise Sales before, you <i>don't know what these obstacles are yet</i>.  So, let the prospective customers who you're going to crash and burn trying to sell to tell you what their objections are.<p>For example, hypothetically suppose one of my day job's customers was looking for a solution to this, and you took my advice and had them call you.  Here's the first question they're going to ask: ""What is your policy for compliance with the Personal Information Protection Act?""  And the answer presumably sounds like ""Umm... let me Google that.""  Now, let's be honest: you're going to totally crash and burn with that sales call.  But you've learned something useful: a) there is a Personal Information Protection Act and b) somebody who was interested enough in my software to pick up the phone/send an email/etc asked about it first, which means that presumably my answer was important in making a buying decision.  So, presumably, if you got it into your head ""I really want to sell to Japanese universities"" you'd a) research the law b) implement the technical and legal measures you'd need to comply with it and c) prominently say so on your website.  Then, the next time someone called you and (having totally failed to read your site in a manner typical of all customers everywhere) asked about the Personal Information Protection Act, you'd have an answer ready to go, so you could get totally humbled by their <i>second</i> question this time.<p>Repeat a few dozen times and you might actually succeed in making Enterprise Sales.<p>(Edit: I had misremembered the English name of the law I cited.)",1257847958

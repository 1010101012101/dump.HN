1238559,comment,1237484,1237700,0,0,lutorm,,,"I would argue that correct intuition about anything can be had without math. Using math may be one way of <i>gaining</i> that intuition, but intuition, by its very nature, is not mathematical.<p>I'm not sure it's useful to argue whether an intuitive picture of electrons hopping or not is more correct. (Electrons are in any case not really little balls that are in one place.) These are all models of the world made with specific goals, where the most ""correct"" model would be solving the schrodinger equation for a macroscopic system -- something that would not give you any particular insight as to how things behave.<p>I think the usefulness of an intuitive layman's understanding should be derived from whether it makes you conclude the correct things about the macroscopic behavior of electricity.",1270299320

It works very well for trivial patches, but not for complicated bugfixes, because those are usually buggy themselves. Accepting a bad change is as dangrous as not acceping a good change. So you'll have to stay in touch with each other, communicating via IM, email or a tracking system, until the issue is really solved.<p>And yes, this process is greatly supported by DVCS.<p>However, it only works if the contributor comes with an attitude like ""I want this bug fixed in upstream"" and <i>not</i> with an attitude like ""Here is my patch - use it or don't"".",1270298978

There is magic to it and it's fast for prep.<p>Recommendations:<p>- Buy a decent pair of kitchen scissors. I cut up almost everything directly into the slow cooker with a pair. It's very fast.<p>- Load up on fresh veggies (a local farmer's market would be ideal). If you make something like chili, cut in 2 - 3 extra bunches of greens like parsley, coriander, young celery, etc.<p>- Buy an extra large cooker and always make enough to have leftovers. I usually plan on getting a solid lunch out of it the next day.<p>- You can make noodle dishes right in the pot if you have access to fresh (refrigerated) noodles. Fresh spaghetti or udon work well. Just rinse and throw them in the pot 5 - 10 minutes before you eat. They soak up sauce and are great.",1270296696

We&#x27;re self-funded and profitable, and we&#x27;re growing fast.<p>Job Description\nMailChimp is seeking a database-focused infrastructure engineer to join our team. You’ll build, maintain, and monitor systems that support millions of users across all products and applications at the company. We operate in a high volume environment and are growing rapidly, adding 10000+ new accounts/day with that rate increasing every week. On the infrastructure side we do interesting work to support that scale and growth rate, working closely with developers to build and support our applications.<p>The engineering teams are small and focused, our benefits are unmatched, and internally we function much like a startup aside from established stability and abundant resources. There are no sales people, no investors, no board, and engineering teams are trusted to make good decisions with resources with minimal oversight.  We are competitive nationally on salary and benefits.<p>Applicants should have strong Linux experience, extremely heavy operational MySQL experience, independent troubleshooting skills, and a love for automation and monitoring.  Our core persistence layer consists of hundreds of horizontally sharded and paired Percona 5.5 instances. We are seeking an experienced engineer who would be part of the core infrastructure team with a focus on maintaining and improving this crucial MySQL layer in addition to contributing to the systems that feed off of it (emailgenome.org, Elasticsearch, Postgres, Redis). We take a pragmatic and practical approach to our stacks using proven components and building our own logic and complexity on top of well understood building blocks. This is a large, well built setup with consistent hardware, configs, monitoring, backups, and tuning in place.<p>Skills and Experience:\n- Linux servers\n- Experience with modern MySQL at high volume: sharding, replication, backups, monitoring, tuning\n- Knowledge of the current MySQL ecosystem and an interest in where things are headed\n- Deep understanding of InnoDB performance, recovery, tuning, and backups\n- Experience with replication and an understanding of all options and components involved\n- Exposure to HA solutions like MMM, haproxy, PXC\n- Scripting and coding (python, bash, php)\n- Puppet or other configuration management tool experience is a big plus\n- Zabbix or other monitoring tools\n- Familiarity with other infrastructure pieces of our stacks (nginx, apache, memcache, postgres, redis, elasticsearch) is also a big plus<p>Please apply here, the applications come directly to me:<p><a href=""http://mailchimp.theresumator.com/apply/oJIqi3/Database-Engineer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mailchimp.theresumator.com/apply/oJIqi3/Database-Engi...</a><p>Many other positions available as well:<p><a href=""http://mailchimp.theresumator.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mailchimp.theresumator.com/</a>",1391327710

7165254,comment,7161901,7161901,1,0,bpm140,,,"My hunch is the &quot;freemium is bad&quot; argument is primarily an oversimplification of the underlying concern -- the erosion of trust and how that manifests during gameplay.<p>When I play a traditional &quot;pay&quot; game, I trust that the developer want me to finish the entire game. After all, the team slaved away creating all that content and the player should damn well appreciate their effort.<p>As a result, when I get stuck at some point in a game (Dead Space 2 being a recent example), I <i>trust</i> that there&#x27;s a way forward and with a little more effort or practice, or perhaps if I retrace my steps, I&#x27;ll become unstuck and move along the path toward completion.<p>Because the developer and I are working with a common goal in mind -- get Eric to the end of the game -- I am confident that at any point in the game I will be capable of completing the challenges set forth (no matter how stingy the Dead Space guys are with ammo).<p>With freemium games, that trust is obliterated. When I can&#x27;t progress, I am forced to ask a fun-sucking question -- is the developer trying to extort money from me in order to continue? Am I unable to continue because I just haven&#x27;t mastered some in-game skill or is this simply the point at which I&#x27;m supposed to hand over my tithe?<p>Candy Crush is an obvious (if extreme) example. When you can&#x27;t complete a level after the 20th try, the player begins to feel that the developer is expressly barring their passage. And at that point, the game ceases to be fun, at least for the generations of gamers who saved the princess.<p>Then again, my kids (eight and six) just assume that buying gems is how one progresses in a game. It&#x27;s not unlike when I was eight and pumping quarters into Gauntlet in order to reach the next level -- Blue Warrior&#x27;s health dropped whether or not you were taking damage.<p>Everything old is new again.",1391327196

One of the sections of the Wikipedia page is titled &quot;Ethnic Tensions and Economic Crisis.&quot; [1]<p>People should also note that the Ukranian activities have been a long, unfolding process - there was the Orange Revolution there just 10 years ago.

Gaining access to individuals of interest, however, is a handy fringe benefit, I imagine, and we should certainly curtail the growth of systems which abet this activity.  We could start by not working for and not letting our friends work for, the architects and implementers of these systems!

Given two candidates of equal competence, I&#x27;d naturally prefer the one with the greater passion for the particular kind of work the job would entail.  Does that really seem strange?<p>Of course it gets trickier when the more competent one seems the less passionate.  Then it&#x27;s a question of how much to weight the two dimensions (along with whatever others one is considering).  I have no magic formula here; I think it depends on the circumstances.<p>There seems to be a subtext here that work sample tests give no indication of passion.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true; when I&#x27;ve given people programming exercises, I think the craftsmanship of the code (is it well-modularized, well-documented, nicely indented, etc.) is indicative of their passion.  Competence, to me, is more about whether the code works.<p>So yes, I&#x27;m using craftsmanship as a proxy for passion, so I suppose next you&#x27;ll ask, why not just go for craftsmanship?  The point we seem to be coming to is that passion is difficult or impossible to measure directly, so why not stick to qualities that are more measurable?<p>I don&#x27;t think everything important is easy to measure.",1391326817

As a result, payment extraction is a solved problem.<p>With the non-negotiable inevitability of payment accepted, and the means to pay made as frictionless as possible, people don&#x27;t think twice about handing over their credit cards the moment a demand is made. When people expect to pay, producers can expect to get paid. It&#x27;s just that simple. Businesses compete for the custom of those who accept the system and it call the cops on the tiny minority who don&#x27;t.<p>The problem with IP is that the legal system that protects every other viable business has imploded. And it&#x27;s not about &quot;just inventing another business model&quot; since the unsolved problem of human nature means having to produce a new law enforcement structure to back that model up. Devolving to private enforcement (e.g. the Mafia) is an obviously unacceptable outcome, so instead of telling IP producers that it&#x27;s up to <i>them</i> to &quot;just invent new models&quot; it&#x27;s really time for people to recognize that law and law enforcement are the responsibility of citizens, not corporations.<p>If you want a smooth and efficient market then come up with the laws and enforcement mechanisms that (a) this kind of market requires and (b) you can live with as a society.

We have <i>positive</i> evidence that some radiation is really bad, and some is sort of bad; we have a bunch of negative confirmations that low levels of many kinds of radiation aren&#x27;t likely to be very bad, and certainly aren&#x27;t super-bad, but the exact borderline isn&#x27;t known, and varies, and a 0.01% increase in cancer with zero benefit is more of a concern to me than a 1% increase in cancer with massive benefit (e.g. a CT for trauma where you&#x27;d otherwise be likely to die).<p>(Incidentally, my fear of ~200 wifi devices transmitting in the milliwatts on 2.4GHz or 5.8GHz or on a flight is approximately zero -- especially since it&#x27;s unclear how many would actually be using the service at any given time, and it&#x27;s a pretty large volume.)",1391326050

I can&#x27;t remember). There are pre-order bonuses, special editions, purely cosmetic items that don&#x27;t change the gameplay, mission packs, &quot;mission pack sequels,&quot; actual sequels, &quot;pay what you want,&quot; donations...<p>It gets &quot;unsavory&quot; when you&#x27;re focusing more on designing the perfect skinner box than actually creating a game. I think games are all about the feelings and mental states you get into when you play them. An action game gets your adrenaline pumping, competitive ones especially so. Strategy games require incredibly deep thought to stay one step ahead of the enemy. Puzzle games really stretch your brain to the limits of logic (or maybe they&#x27;re just bullshit). From my experience, the games that people malign when they talk about mobile games and &quot;social games,&quot; on the other hand, promote nothing but anxiety, and use it as a tool to wedge themselves into your subconscious so that you will fork over more cash into their creator&#x27;s pockets. See the common practice of games based around waiting for something to happen, and bugging you with an alert whenever it does. I don&#x27;t think very well of people that create things (I won&#x27;t dignify them by calling them games) that do nothing but prey on anxiety, compulsion, and our attractions to flashing lights.<p>It&#x27;s the difference between creating something that people will pay $50 to experience, and creating something that is engineered to repeatedly exploit our basest <i>negative</i> emotions. These games are in some senses <i>worse than heroin</i>, because at least <i>heroin</i> is fun while it lasts.<p>Jonathan Blow does the topic far more justice than I can at the moment (what am I doing, it&#x27;s way too late to be drink posting on HN...) in his talk &quot;Video Games and the Human Condition&quot;[1], if you&#x27;re interested. It&#x27;s nearly two hours long, but I believe it&#x27;s very much worth your time.<p>As for &quot;why do other startups not get shit for this,&quot; I think there&#x27;s a big difference between A/B testing different versions of your game&#x27;s site to see which version results in more &quot;conversions&quot; or whatever it&#x27;s called, and designing your entire &quot;game&quot; around frisking people at every turn and being the best darn frisker you can. Not to mention the ones obviously marketed to children, which reasonable people agree is one step removed from turning up at your local elementary school with a trenchcoat full of free samples.<p>(I have no idea who you are or what games you make, so don&#x27;t take these comments personally, this is just my general opinion of the mobile games I&#x27;ve tried. If it (or <i>especially</i> Jonathan Blow&#x27;s talk, because he&#x27;s much more eloquent than tired, drunken me) rings close to home, however, it might not be a bad idea to download a pack of the 1000+ NES games and try a few at random for a reminder of what playing a <i>real game</i> is like)<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqFu5O-oPmU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqFu5O-oPmU</a>",1391325804

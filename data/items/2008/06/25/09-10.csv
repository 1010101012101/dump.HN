From PEP 8:<p><pre><code>  Indentation\n\n    Use 4 spaces per indentation level.\n</code></pre>\n(see <a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/</a>)<p>I'm partial to spaces in general. Most (all?) IDEs can insert spaces when you press the tab key, and doing so will prevent the nastiness that can happen when you mix spaces with tabs.",1214387754

If you spent the $250 for QuickBooks and find that it saves you 100 hours of time over using Office Accounting (which was free), which is the better value?<p>I haven't used OA 2008 but I tried 2006 and 2007 - #$%^ that ($*%.",1214387435

Don't get many opportunities for that!</i>). I'm a big fan of using the defaults when it comes to development.

His answer will be "" I do not know"". Honest, right?<p>As kids we always expressed our feelings and thoughts properly and truthfully through words and actions. But, somewhere between the age of 4 and 9 we start to have others think for us. We are thought sets of realities that mostly make no sense to us (as children).<p>By the time we reach 13 we already have all this new man made reality that we are supposed to live and think by without much questioning.<p>So this creates a massive database of words and actions we go to first to express our thoughts and feelings.<p>By doing this we ignore our highest truth. We create a conflict between what we put our there and what we really feel and know inside. There begins the war within ourselves.<p>We almost cannot reverse engineer in months what we have created in millenniums. I do not think this mass change in the way we think is going to happen in our lifetime.<p>But we can stop stopping our kids to think for themselves. Stop giving them sets of realities that are contradictory to  their real honest and pure feelings and thoughts. You would think this would create an anarchy, but we will land far from that.",1214385011

I come from a family of Wall St. people and I can attest to the fact that most ""street"" news is consumed by non-insiders.  My dad is a financial advisor and essentially spends his day telling people that what they saw on CNN Moneyline (or whatever it's called) isn't true.  So there are plenty of non-pros who you could target.<p>Personally I don't care about the market so I'm not the one to ask.  But I thought your site did what it needed to do well...

The use of force is only illegal if there is somebody stronger stopping me.  Can you point to an instance where this is untrue?  If there isn&#x27;t such a person, I&#x27;m creating a law.  For example, if I spank my children for swearing, I&#x27;m making a law against swearing, and if there&#x27;s no local, state, or federal law prohibiting it, then nobody will initiate force against me.  Depending on how a law is made, it may be inconsistent, unjust, totalitarian, etc.<p>I also don&#x27;t understand why it is senseless to say that force establishes law.  That&#x27;s what law enforcement officers do, they use force to establish / enforce the law.  Of course legality is subject to the whims of the powerful; in a democracy, &quot;whims of the powerful&quot; approximates majority rule.<p>A &quot;law&quot; is just a rule that is punished when broken.  If there is no punishment, it is a guideline or moral.",1377979188

You&#x27;re speaking from an ethical perspective, but Rayiner is not. He&#x27;s making a point about logical sphere of influence - it&#x27;s not cold and uncaring towards distant suffering, just not prioritized.<p>I&#x27;m sure Rayiner feels deep sympathy for places that are not presently near to him (such as India, in this thread).<p>If every major problem in the United States were already solved, it would be more reasonable to then try to help others solve their problems. But that&#x27;s not the case.<p>If you have people suffering right in front of you, it just makes sense logistically to help them first. Helping our own homeless and unemployed would aid in stimulating the American economy.<p>The bottom line is that there isn&#x27;t any sane reason why an American would prioritize the needs of another country before his own. Nor would it be sane for an Indian to prioritize America&#x27;s while she lives in India. It just doesn&#x27;t make sense. You tend to your side of the street first.",1377979137

Like they were doing fine, and someone came along and said &quot;time to live outside, trash!&quot;<p>Lets have an adult attitude here.  In general, this means accepting that:<p>- you don&#x27;t have all the solutions, and if people just did it your way it probably wouldn&#x27;t help much and would probably make things worse, since your armchair understanding of the problem is probably mostly assumptions and other bullshit.<p>- all the worlds problems are not caused because the people who disagree with you are evil and prefer a world where people suffer, or intentionally want to make things worse.  In reality, almost no one is this way, if they propose a different solution or course of action it&#x27;s because they see the world differently from different experiences and understanding.<p>- if there is a solution, it is very unlikely to be any of the things currently proposed or attempted, and will likely require innovative thinking and new solutions.  If someone somewhere had figured out an effective and affordable solution, you could point to it and say &quot;look, they figured out a great solution that we can afford and works well&quot;, and everyone would say &quot;YEA!&quot;, and that&#x27;s the end of it, assuming there isn&#x27;t some non-obvious side effect that crops up later and makes the solution actually more harmful than doing nothing, which there usually is.",1377979131

1) hard numbers; where do I confirm everything you are saying, analogy to economy does not make it true (nor are you proving that the first concept it&#x27;s true)
2) if you create something specific to A, expecting it to adapt to B magically is wrong, C has to adapt it bringing more work to the flow
3) &quot;Consumers, on the other hand, rarely care about the technology itself but focus instead on what the technology enables them to achieve.&quot; Sure, but that would also mean that they are not interested in the enabled features by it so was it interested on the technology or whatever it enabled or not?

That said, low temperatures do increase the internal resistance of batteries. If you put your phone in the freezer for a while (probably not a great idea due to the high ambient moisture) then it will turn off, and not turn back on. A little bit later, it&#x27;ll probably tell you that it can&#x27;t turn on because of low battery. But once it&#x27;s back up to room temperature, it should turn on just fine (again, assuming the moisture in the freezer hasn&#x27;t screwed it up really badly).<p>Blocking radio signals is one thing, but using a fridge might have been an effective way to deactivate most off-the-shelf batteries in a non-invasive and impermanent way.

Why that is so is not as simple as the country&#x27;s broken social institutions, we&#x27;re still talking about the world&#x27;s largest democracy here. I would imagine the caste system plays a part. Colonialism too.</i><p>Wealth disparity is not what Rayiner was talking about. He was talking about social infrastructure. You&#x27;re actually adding to his point here.<p>What he meant was that the wealthy class in India have about the same spending power as the middle class in the United States. They are sheltered away from the extreme destitution that is on display <i>everywhere</i> in their country and don&#x27;t interact with the poor at all. It&#x27;s perhaps 10x what you&#x27;d see from a rich person walking in NYC avoiding a beggar asking for change on the street.<p>Rapid urbanization and the slow collapse of the caste system has left a vacuum in India&#x27;s culture that leads to stories like that of the poor woman we saw on Hacker News just last week or so. <i>That</i> is the lack of social infrastructure.

6307861,comment,6307402,6307697,4,0,jaytaylor,,,"I lived in Provo and Orem for a number of years while I was attending University, and I feel you&#x27;ve nailed some of the major issues.  Life was drastically different there compared to where I grew up (and now live) in the Bay Area.<p>One on-topic aspect I appreciated about Utah was the quality of the Computer Science program at Utah Valley University.  The chance to learn from experts like Chuck Allison [1] and David Heldenbrand truly expanded my mind and was an incredible opportunity.  Really, all the CS faculty was excellent and commendably eager to do the teaching themselves rather than offloading the most critical parts to TA&#x27;s.  Given the high ratio of religious fanatics in the surrounding region, the school is a remarkably open and progressive institution.<p>As soon as I finished school I moved back to Palo Alto and would never consider returning to Utah other than to visit friends, go skiing/snowboarding, or go to hike at Moab or Zion National Park.<p>I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend going to Provo or Orem to start a tech company.<p>To put things in perspective: Provo is 29 short highway miles from Eagle Mountain, which is primarily composed of polygamist compounds.  I&#x27;m not saying there is anything wrong with being a polygamist; it was just a surprise to find out about it only after several years of living in Provo.<p>There is a reason that Provo and Orem often referred to as the &quot;Utah Valley Bubble&quot;.  It is an isolated community and if you aren&#x27;t Mormon you will likely pretty strange when you discover how poorly you fit in with the homogeneous culture.<p>With that being said, there are some upsides to operating a business in Utah Valley:<p>You can hire high-quality engineers for pennies (or perhaps a quarter) on the dollar compared to other places.  At one point I interviewed at Omniture, and they scoffed at the salary I asked for.<p>People who live in Utah Valley are also less likely to move away as much compared to other places, because their immediate and extended families tend to live nearby.  This means that it is possible to expect to retain employees for much longer period of times than in a place such as Silicon Valley.<p>Finally: If you are into discriminating against people for their sexual orientation, it is completely legal to do so in Utah.  There is no legal protection from sexual orientation discrimination in Utah.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=chuck+allison"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=chuck+allison</a>",1377978733

It is hoped that this will be taken (esp. by the author, if he&#x27;s around) as the respectful critique it is intended to be.]<p>I&#x27;m wondering about this. It&#x27;s a heck of a lot of text to get a across a couple of simple ideas.<p>It feels like the author has been stuck in a little a corner of the programming world for some time, and he thinks that everyone has been doing things the way he has. So if he needs to learn something new, then everyone else must need it also.<p>People have been writing interactive, event/message-driven programs for the mass market ever since the Macintosh came out ~30 years ago. Sometimes interfaces between internal components have been written in that same style; sometimes they haven&#x27;t. Doing a whole system that way is a nice idea, but hardly a revolutionary one.<p>And scalability? One can&#x27;t really design a scalable architecture until it is clear how a system will need to scale. Will it be huge number of app instances talking to a central data store? Will it be a huge amount of data managed separately by each app instance? Will it be huge numbers of P2P connections between instances? Etc. And information like that is sometimes unavailable until a system has been in existence for a while.<p>And let&#x27;s not forget Knuth and premature optimization.<p>OTOH, the resilience ideas are definitely worthwhile. Reliability standards for computer systems are rising like crazy. Architectural ideas for improving reliability, robustness, etc., need to be thought about more. So good for the author on this one.<p>Now, put it all together and clear out the fluff, and I get this: A good way to design computer systems is to use modular components that talk to each other using non-blocking interfaces, in such a way that component failure does not bring down the system. That&#x27;s a fine thought, although not a terribly revolutionary one. And it hardly needs an 18,000-word essay with 4 figures to get it across.",1377978006

There&#x27;s some finite risk allowance, and the idea is that you should load up 100% on business model risk-- which means no experimenting with open allocation, remote work, etc.-- because business model risk is what the VCs are good at analyzing and there&#x27;s a bit of golden hammer syndrome (&quot;when you have a great hammer, everything looks like a nail.&quot;)<p>As a practical directive, I think it&#x27;s dead fucking wrong (practically; morally, people can run their businesses how they wish) and here&#x27;s why. If you load up 100% on business model risk, then 0% gets allocated to employees. They get no autonomy, work long hours, and generally get abused because &quot;we don&#x27;t have any slack in the schedule&quot;. Well? If your business model is innovative but the only thing you&#x27;re delivering to employees is the stereotypical soul-sucking corporate job, you&#x27;re going to have to give 25-35% annual raises each year (as Wall Street does) to keep anyone good. That&#x27;s expensive, unsustainable, and by necessity leads to an up-or-out culture that fries the place anyway. Of course, startups replace this with equity options and hope the exponential curve of the valuation will deliver the implicit raises, but anyone who can do basic math on a typical engineer grant (typically $5-20k per year at-valuation) is going to find it weak as a motivational tool.<p>If people have the autonomy to direct their own careers and work on things that interest them, they&#x27;re a lot less expensive in the long run, because it doesn&#x27;t take a 30% pay bump and a newer, shinier management title each year to keep them on. This is even more true in startups. People expect, e.g., Microsoft or Goldman, to be bureaucratic. If people go into a startup and find that the traditional hierarchy and closed-allocation regime are in place, they&#x27;re going to feel cheated and get pissed.<p>If you want good people and you want them to be motivated by the work instead of an exponentially growing paycheck, that means you have to experiment and give them unusually high degrees of autonomy.",1377977283

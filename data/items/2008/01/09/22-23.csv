96565,comment,96313,96439,0,0,geebee,,,"Unfortunately, this has happened to some extent with CS programs offered through the math department.  CS is so severely impacted at a lot of UCs, and a lot of students (probably pretty good ones) are denied access to the major, so some students look into doing an alternate CS-style major through the math department.  The reason I say ""unfortunately"" is that I think the students who get bounced from CS but make it through math could have made it through CS if there had been more resources for them.  It's stupid to have people who really want to be majoring in CS working through Real Analysis proofs that they don't enjoy or even particularly care much about.<p>Some of this is just because math is a bit cheaper on the budget.  A whiteboard and a room is all you need for most math classes, so they tend to take most people who want to give it a crack.  It's pretty hard to get into an upper division CS class as a non-major, because they barely have space for the majors (again, I don't think this is the case at well funded private universities with small undergrad populations like Stanford or MIT - it's more of a problem at Berkeley and other large state-supported institutions).  Maybe it's also cultural within the field.  If you go up to a math professor and ask if you can join his class without the pre-reqs, he's more likely than a CS professor to say ""well, as long as you think you can handle it, sure.""  I suspect math professors are just a bit more laid back than the CS ones.<p>But overall, I do agree with you - nobody drops out of a ""hard"" major to take the ""easier"" classes in the math dept.",1199919231
96564,comment,96313,96396,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"I heard it's the same way at Stanford.  CS, math,physics and engineering majors go to Wall Street, consulting, or Silicon Valley.  Guys from Caltech frequently go to either tech companies, Wall Street or Grad School (and research/academia).  Ironically, engineering firms (like Bechtel) don't attract as many engineers to build things like bridges because they can't pay as much for them.  They get their engineers from less hyped schools.",1199918801

96559,comment,96492,96492,0,0,skmurphy,,,"I think that anything that accelerates the product development process would fit into this category: e.g. CAD/CAM, collaboration tools, prototyping or software development tools.<p>I accept Peter Drucker's thesis that a ""firm has only two real functions, marketing and innovation, and everything else is cost,"" and would broaden the ""make money"" definition to include innovation.<p>As a side benefit many of these innovation tools also help to cut costs, although if there is unmet internal demand for a function you may actually get more usage and not affect total cost that much. Lowering the marginal cost of an activity can increase its frequency. In other words, even though the transaction cost is lowered, the total amount of time and dollars spent may stay the same or go up slightly because the firm is consuming more of it. Examples might be the amount of time spent on E-mail vs. hard copy letters, screen views vs. plots or printouts of a complex object, or   daily builds of large systems with integrated regression testing vs. weekly builds two decades ago.",1199918110

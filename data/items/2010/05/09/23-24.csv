Found the mathematics more interesting at this level (though still quite arbitrary) and scored a high grade.\nThe point isn't that I scored high, but that I could've taken the more interesting further mathematics, had I taken an interest in mindless long division methods earlier on.<p>The sad part is that I'm not even the smartest guy in the room, I'm just so damn insistent on doing things logically.<p>Anyway, I'm posting this anonymously because it's more than I'd like to admit to, but am throwing it out there in case anyone else has taken this style of learning to such absurd levels (and I'll re-iterate, I'm not blowing my trumpet, I'm not especially smart).",1273449550
1333094,comment,1332948,1332948,0,0,hristov,,,"That seems right. I think that a lot of the educational curriculum is just targeted to the average, so if you are smarter, it can just all seem incredibly boring.<p>One example which really pissed me off when i was a student is how so many math classes in college base a huge portion of your final grade on tons of mind numbing homework. This of course is targeted to the average idiot: the university has figured out that most students have trouble with math and in order to avoid high failing grades they create homework which is a way for people to get points toward their grade by solving the same simple problem over and over and over again. And of course you do not need to understand the material to do the homework, because if there is a problem you cannot do you can just ask the TA, etc. Thus, they replace true understanding with memorisation and dull grinding work. Of course most smart people I knew would more or less blow off the homework and just ace the tests, and thus they would often end up getting a B- even though they probably understood the material better than anyone else.",1273449494

Around the beginning of high school I put my mind to work—and realized that as long as I continued to <i>pass</i>, no one was going to look at my <i>high-school</i> marks besides university acceptance committees. Further, it was both easier and cheaper to attend Low-Status Community College A, get a high CGPA, and use that to enter/finish at High-Status University B by course transfer, than it would be to try to be accepted by B from the start, given that the first few undergraduate years of A and B are basically the same (there's really a limit to how much you can learn in a Calculus I course, no matter how well the teacher is being paid or how many grants they've received.)<p>I promptly stopped being ""gifted.""

However, the association is less perfect with regards to atherogenesis; in other words, the glycemic index/heart disease risk may be purely mediated by diabetes.<p>Nevertheless, this article is a great start; I like that the media is now starting to pick up on the correct correlation between carbs and atherosclerosis - and if they also begin to understand and convey the glycemic index, so much the better. As the studies discussed in this reasonably well-cited article indicate, carbohydrate load correlates with the atherogenic lipid profile, whereas saturated fat load does not.",1273446972

1333026,comment,1331958,1332206,0,0,tbrownaw,,,"""A free market does a very good job of providing most things other than a free market.""<p>Much (possibly most) regulation is harmful, but some is good or even necessary.<p>Given that ISPs tend to have local monopolies, they need to be prevented from abusing those monopolies like they've started trying to do.<p>If the having local monopolies is not taken as a given, and the local governments don't hand out monopoly powers... well you still have to deal with how the high up-front costs of laying new wires makes various anti-competitive tactics more effective, and how the already meager competition seems to be merging into fewer and fewer competitors.<p>So in this case, you can either regulate to try to preserve a mostly-free market (lots of antitrust investigations and suits) in last-mile connectivity, or assume a monopoly and regulate to minimize the damage it can cause. The first probably minimizes harm to the regulated industry, the second minimizes harm to industries damaged by monopolistic actions in the regulated industry. I expect that the last-mile industry itself is relatively low value compared to the industries it can damage (much like water, electricity, and phone service), so the second option would be preferable.",1273446916

My only requirements are Wifi, USB (host), and a small form factor. Don't need a lot of ram/flash/etc or any video output. I've been really surprised by the lack of options. The ASUS WL-520gU is around USD$30 but is a bit too large. The Fonera 2.0g (€35) would be perfect, but it's not available in the US.<p>Another really cool (tiny!) looking device is the Ubiquiti Ministation, but unfortunately it doesn't have USB and therefore isn't a choice for this project.<p>For when you need more power, there are a lot of cool options such as the BeagleBoard and GuruPlug <a href=""http://www.globalscaletechnologies.com/t-guruplugdetails.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.globalscaletechnologies.com/t-guruplugdetails.asp...</a>",1273446680

A couple reasons that I see that they may change though are:<p>1) A slight jab at Google.  Right now I have my mac address book, iPhone, and Google address book all syncing OTA.  It was a bit of a PITA to setup, but works now.  If Apple offered the same service for free I would most likely switch.<p>2) Making the service free could add another selling point for macs, iPhones, and iPads.  A ""buy this item and you also get into another exclusive club"" type of thing.  The problem with this reason is that Apple doesn't seem to need to do this right now since demand already seems quite high at the moment.<p>My guess is that mobile me will not be free anytime soon unless Apple rolls out some new base technology that requires MM to function.",1273446163

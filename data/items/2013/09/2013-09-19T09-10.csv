The idea was that this would explain in detail to someone reading the code what I was doing with the pieces of a wooden train set. This was critical to the operation of the program and I imagined that many of the readers of the code would need a careful explanation.<p>It turns out that I&#x27;d forgotten what this code does so the comment was helpful.<p><pre><code>  # The 15 possible pieces: a straight edge (which has $unit length) and

  # twice the length of the straight edge; it is actually supplied in
  # two pieces but for the purposes of this program is considered to be
  # a single piece) and a curve (using $radians_in_curve above the
  # length of the straight line between the ends of the curve is
  # calculated).
  #
  # Each entry consists of three parts:  
  #
  # length: the length in a straight line between the ends of the piece
  # at its centre. 
  #
  # angle: the angle (in radians) between the straight line through the
  # piece and a tangent to the curve at the piece&#x27;s start.  This only
  # applies to curved pieces where the straight line is the line joining
  # its two endpoints.
  #
  # count: how many of these pieces are supplied.
  #
  # Note that curves can be placed in either a clockwise or
  # anticlockwise direction. The program detects this by looking at the
  # angle.  If it&#x27;s non-zero then the piece has two orientations.

6410724,comment,6409502,6409882,3,0,seclorum,,,"This is a subject that is very dear to me, so I will try not to rant about it.<p>There are a couple of things &quot;wrong&quot; with the way we teach kids computers today.<p>Our educators are in the hands of the masters of consumers.  When a new technology comes out, we all abandon the current stuff, and engage in the upgrade cycle.  Repeat until generations have no clue any more about what the old ways were.<p>This is an absolute falsehood pushed upon society by those who wish to control the consumer base.  It is consumption destroying education, plain and simple.<p>The point is this: Every C64 that was ever produced - heck, every 8-bit computer, ever - <i>STILL WORKS</i>, or can be <i>MADE TO WORK</i> in the area of computer education.<p>It is absolutely arbitrary that computers get old.  Every machine that was ever made, is still just as useful as it ever was - the difference is, the user walked away (because they are consumers not users).<p>I have a large collection of &#x27;antique&#x27; computers in my midst: C64, Atari, Oric, Atmos, Telestrat, MSX, heck .. even a BeBox and an SGI O2.  All are still working, all are still quite capable of engaging a young mind in the exercise of exploration and discovery that makes a good developer.<p>And, my 3 year old and 6 year old kids LOVE THEM.  They absolutely LOVE the old sprites, the old simple ways.  The 6-year old takes immense joy out of typing:<p><pre><code>    10 PING
    20 WAIT 15
    30 EXPLODE
    40 WAIT 50
    50 GOTO 10
</code></pre>
.. into an old Oric Atmos thats been set up exclusively for him to be able to do that .. in fact the very first writing he was able to do was in typing in a BASIC PROGRAM!!<p>The 3 year old absolutely loves that he can turn the machine off and on, and off and on, and off and on .. and it will still work.  Can&#x27;t do that with Daddy&#x27;s workstation!<p>So the point is, parents: disconnect your kids from the consumer trap.  Give them old computers to learn computing on.  Everything they will ever learn, <i>WILL STILL BE VALUABLE TODAY</i> when they &#x27;grow up and get a bigger computer&#x27; - the reason is, because computers still work, fundamentally, the same way.<p>I predict my 6 year old will be hacking in assembly by the time he is 10 - just like his Dad did.  And thats what made me the developer I am today.<p>(BTW: yes, I also have rPi&#x27;s, Beagleboards, and so on.. when they&#x27;re ready, they&#x27;ll be available to the kids to hack on.  But if the kids can&#x27;t do their own low-level programming by the time they get the rPi dusted off, I will be <i>very</i> surprised..)<p>EDIT: Another thing that is &#x27;wrong&#x27; with computers today, imho, is the decoupling of development from use.  Again, our computers have been turned into consumption platforms - the moment that Microsoft removed the developer tools from being part of the base OS image, computers started to lose a lot of value.  Any OS that doesn&#x27;t ship with a way of building apps for it, inherently included by design, isn&#x27;t an Operating System - its a Consumer Capture System.<p>Do everything you can to get development tools back into the OS, people.  It is more important than the desire to reduce the effect of having &#x27;too many smart developers out there&#x27;..",1379584180

However, a big reason why they are is because there is such a huge pool of 20-something devs out there who are eagerly lined up to jump into gamedev. And it usually takes several years of living in that meat grinder for the scales to fall away from peoples&#x27; eyes, but even then as they leave there are plenty more lined up to take their place. From the perspective of management there&#x27;s no problem at all, even though such working conditions actually cause a lot of fundamental issues in being able to successfully execute and continually losing the most senior and experienced devs as they get older and less tolerant of bullshit is kind of a big deal.<p>See also: silicon valley startup culture.",1379584062

The coast guard abandoned the island a few years later, leaving the reindeer. Subsequently, the reindeer population rose to about 6,000 by 1963[5] and then died off in the next two years to 42 animals.[6] A scientific study attributed the population crash to the limited food supply in interaction with climatic factors (the winter of 196364 was exceptionally severe in the region).[1] By the 1980s, the reindeer population had completely died out.[2] Environmentalists see this as an issue of overpopulation.<p>(from here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Matthew_Island"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Matthew_Island</a>)",1379584040

Let me describe the help:<p>I&#x27;d been stuck, and pretty much given up. A friend wondered if there was someone I could ask - but it was virgin territory, no one had done it before, and so no one would know. I only tried EE because what the hell.
I didn&#x27;t get a <i>specific</i> answer, but <i>&quot;X does that - why don&#x27;t you see how X does it?&quot;</i> This was a clever, insightful, lateral point of view.  I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to use X&#x27;s technique - but amazingly, it turned out I could! The suggestion might seem obvious in hindsight, but it wasn&#x27;t to me. It was just what I needed to hear - a great answer.<p>I&#x27;d describe this as &quot;micro-consultation&quot; or &quot;micro-mentoring&quot;, which differs from SO&#x27;s aim of specific concrete answers to specific concrete questions. I think the money-motivation of EE helped encourage someone to spend a few moments creative thought on my question.
It&#x27;s the kind of insight you get from having many contributors to an open-source project - but who&#x27;s going to bother, for the case where only one person benefits?<p>So... I do think this <i>kind</i> of service, sort of halfway between SO and full-on consultancy, is valuable and has a role - but micro, like Amazon&#x27;s mechanical turk.  I think Google Answers tried this (now defunct).  A little bit like that logo design site SO used (<a href=""http://99designs.com.au/logo-design/contests/logo-stackoverflow-6774"" rel=""nofollow"">http://99designs.com.au/logo-design/contests/logo-stackoverf...</a>) - a sort of eBay for consultancy, but a micro version.<p>Because consultancy is very question-specific, they&#x27;d be almost no question reuse (unlike SO), which also fits with a money motive (i.e. people love karma/fame; but if not available, fortune is OK). So I&#x27;m suggesting a micro-consultancy facilitation site, where the <i>asker pays the answerer</i> and EE takes a wee percentage (a similar amount to crowd-sourcing sites).

6410704,comment,6406898,6408770,1,0,lotso,,,"From the Wikipedia page on graphic design:<p>&quot;Graphic design is a creative process between a client and a designer, traditionally completed in conjunction with producers of form (printers, sign makers, programmers etc.). Graphic design is created to convey a specific message (or messages) to a targeted audience. The field is also often referred to as Visual Communication or Communication Design. Graphic designers use various methods to create and combine words, symbols, and images to create a visual representation of ideas and messages. A graphic designer may use a combination of typography, visual arts and page layout techniques to produce a final result. Graphic design often refers to both the process (designing) by which the communication is created and the products (designs) which are generated.
Common uses of graphic design include identity (logos and branding), publications (magazines, newspapers and books), print advertisements, posters, billboards, website graphics and elements, signs and product packaging. For example, a product package might include a logo or other artwork, organized text and pure design elements such as images, shapes and color which unify the piece. Composition is one of the most important features of graphic design, especially when using pre-existing materials or diverse elements.&quot;<p>It seems to me graphic design is more about the visual appearance than &quot;how it works.&quot; I&#x27;ve read a fair amount of books on interaction, product, and visual design and have never read that graphic design had been all of those things.<p>I&#x27;ve worked at companies where you have people working specifically on either interaction design, visual design, motion design, or user research. All of them were contributing to how it works and how it looks, and had distinct jobs (although they worked closely together).<p>Also, Human-Computer Interaction is a field that is newer than graphic design, and touches more on just visual design, so I&#x27;m not really sure why you are pushing this idea that graphic design = UX/interaction/product design.",1379583769

Wouldn&#x27;t you say that this what the Arrticle Author proposes is a mixture of &quot;Achievement of Natural Growth&quot; with &quot;Concerted Cultivation&quot;. Shortly speaking we let kids question authority and let them play at the same time?<p>Then my understanding of the article was that the very nature of homo sapiens is that before they are adults they will copy and imitate adults around them with other kids. So, just letting them do it and not interfering with the process is better than restricting it with parents guidelines, i.e. let the kids discover what adults do via play in their own way. Then main benefit being that you will not kill their natural interest in important stuff they have to learn.<p>My 3 year plays with the letters and numbers all the time using different toys, including one of these &quot;kid laptops&quot; we bought her. Just this morning she woke us up repeating alphabet after the &quot;kid laptop&quot;. She has natural interest in it. Why? Because she is not forced to sit still in a chair and repeat the letters after a grumpy &quot;important&quot; adult. She would hate that then. The idea is that learning via play is not only more effective, but the natural way we homo sapiens do it. Taking it away makes us socially handicapped. As the play happens usually in cooperation with other kids. That was at least how I understood the article.",1379581696
6410617,comment,6409888,6410589,61,0,anon1385,,,"Bullshit. These kinds of installers trick people into installing things they would never install by choice. For example there are windows where ticking one checkbox disables installation of a toolbar, but ticking the next one enables a different one. So people read the text on the first one and then tick everything, which results in spyware being installed on their machine. The entire installation process for these kinds of things is like that because NOBODY who knows what they are actually wants to install spyware toolbars on their computer.<p>Would you consider tricking a person with poor literacy skills into signing a contract that gives them your house a moral thing to do? Why is tricking somebody into giving you full access to their computer any different?

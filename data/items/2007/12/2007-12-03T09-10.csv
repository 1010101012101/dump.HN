software for online malls.""<p>Was this Viaweb?",1196675232

I've realized that 97.482% of the time I'm just coding/web browsing/emailing/chatting, which doesn't require too much horsepower. I also think the XO will make an excellent ebook reader. Screw the Kindle!<p>It will be a pleasant downgrade from the ginormous 17"" PowerBook I've been lugging around for the past 4 years.",1196673568
85555,comment,85521,85551,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"Unfortunately at this point the ""view/edit source"" button is exactly the same as on browsers... view source. It only works for web pages and it's not editable. I think the editable version is in the works.<p>I do think it's a great idea, but I imagine it would be very overwhelming for a kid who has never used a computer before, let alone programmed (in a foreign language, too, most likely).<p>What would be <i>really</i> neat was if in addition to opening the source, it also had some sort of dynamic tutorial that would explain what the kid was looking at. For example, they open up a webpage and it explains the HTML to them.",1196673325

If you guys have some interesting idea to run some niche job site, we can make a deal. You will provide a domain (owned by you and directed to my dns servers) I will provide a code (owned by me).<p>Also I would like to give a hosting space at site5.com which I need not anymore to people working on some interesting open-source project. Hosting is prepaid for the next 14 months. You can find hosting parameters here: www.site5.com/hosting<p>Please understand, I can't reply to every e-mail I get (address is in my profile at news.YC). Also note for some people: jobitems.com domain and code aren't for sale.",1196673207

All I need is ssh and a browser (I use vim, which runs fine remotely), though I also plan to buy a 16GB USB drive for extra storage...keeping a local working copy of my projects will mean I don't have to have connectivity to work, though I suspect it'll be slower than working on the server when WiFi is available.<p>I like little lappies anyway--my current one is a Dell 700n, and I only got it instead of a smaller one because the smaller ones were twice as expensive.",1196673054

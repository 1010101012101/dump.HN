Especially when it comes to seat pitch, coach class is clearly denied what is necessary and, worse still, this is intentional. There&#x27;s a lovely quote by a French engineer named Jules Dupuit going back to 1849, which explains the conundrum. I think he was talking about railroad cars but the argument applies to air travel just the same. Quote:<p><i>&quot;It is not because of the few thousand francs which would have to be spent to put a roof over the third-class carriage or to upholster the third-class seats that some company or other has open carriages with wooden benches ... What the company is trying to do is prevent the passengers who can pay the second-class fare from traveling third class; it hits the poor, not because it wants to hurt them, but to frighten the rich ... And it is again for the same reason that the companies, having proved almost cruel to the third-class passengers and mean to the second-class ones, become lavish in dealing with first-class customers. Having refused the poor what is necessary, they give the rich what is superfluous.&quot;</i>",1433357956

9654942,comment,9651011,9654552,0,0,mpixorg,,,"There are two main scenarios for fork(), and the lack of distinction between them is what I suspect led to some of the articulated worries.<p>The first scenario, in the spirit of traditional unix, consists of the sequence fork+execve. This scenraio is supported in midipix, yet requires that the (optional) subsystem performs execve on behalf of the forkee. As noted earlier, if all the child does is call execve, then application authors should consider switching to posix_spawn not only due to its better portability, but also for performance reasons.<p>The second, and arguably more interesting scenario, takes place when the child brnaches away from the parent process, performs (in parallel) a designated portion of a larger task, and then exits. This second scenario has been thoroughly tested and works as expected with respect to IPC, I/O, signal delivery, and nested forking.<p>In either of the above scenarios, there is no expectation that the child could interact with csrss, create or operate on GDI handles, or otherwise use the WIN32 API directly. Then again, it is expected that a process that calls fork() will not have any of the GUI libraries loaded at the time the call is made. Any limitation here, if any, has little to no relevance to existing applications that depend of fork, but only to what I fondly call the &quot;fetishization of fork&quot; in discussions about posix-to-windows portability. Applications that truly depend on fork were written with neither WIN32 nor GDI in mind, and therefore will not break due to such windows-specific interfaces not being available (as an aside, an X11 application calling fork() from within its event loop is an equally bad design regardless of whether the operating system supports that or not).<p>Looking forward to further cooperation! I hope this addresses at least some of the questions you have raised.",1433357759

9654923,comment,9649005,9650777,0,0,skhatri11,,,"Here&#x27;s an example of a writeup. There are several more like this. This position is up approximately 30%.<p>SunEdison is an attractive investment opportunity:\nby Jay Yoon\nMarch 11, 2015, 2:57 p.m.<p>Solar Is Cost Competitive Even Without Subsidies:<p>In general, I am very bullish on the overall solar sector. The cost of solar has declined to the point where it is competitive on a non-subsidized basis in many countries. Currently, solar is cheaper than retail electricity in approximately 30 countries. This includes some of the largest solar markets such as US, Japan and Germany. Other large countries, most notably China and India, are very close to grid parity.<p>Adoption of Solar Is Still At the Beginning Stages.<p>The overall penetration of solar is very low today (approximately 0.3% of global electricity generation). A small increase to 1% penetration will triple the market size. Thus, the solar industry is still at the beginning stages of a prolonged period of growth. The cost of solar will continue to decline going forward which will lead to the increased penetration of solar in many countries. For example, in the US, solar is currently cost competitive on a non-subsidized basis in 14 states. By 2016, this number is expected to increase to 47 states.<p>Leading Market Position.<p>SUNE is well-positioned to take advantage of the long-term growth in solar due to its leading market position. SUNE is currently the largest renewable energy provider in the world. In FY 2015, the Company expects to install between 2.1 – 2.3 GW of solar and wind projects. By comparison, SolarCity guided for between 920MW – 1 GW of deployments in FY 2015. SUNE’s competitive moat is significant. The Company’s scale and first-mover advantage provides them with project development expertise, access to capital and a broad network of relationships. SUNE also has a geographically diverse business which mitigates country-specific risk.<p>Differentiated Business Model.<p>SUNE has a differentiated and diverse business model. The Company entered the wind power market through their acquisition of First Wind. More recently, SUNE entered the energy storage business through its January acquisition of Solar Grid Storage. Thus, as a “one-stop-shop” provider of renewable energy services, SUNE has been able to differentiate itself from competitors.<p>Terraform and Future Yieldcos To Unlock Significant Value.<p>The formation of the Terraform Yieldco has allowed SUNE to retain the majority of its solar projects rather than selling them to a third party. The Company’s ROI from a retained project is significantly higher than the ROI realized from selling the project to a third party financial buyer. SUNE has announced its plans to form additional Yieldcos in the future, including an emerging markets Yieldco focused on projects in Africa and Asia. Terraform, along with the formation of future Yieldcos, will allow SUNE to maximize the value received from its solar and wind project developments.<p>Trading At A Large Discount to Fair Value.<p>SUNE shares are trading at a large discount to fair value. As I mentioned previously, the Company expects to install 2.1 – 2.3 GW of solar and wind projects in FY 2015. If SUNE sold these projects to a third party, I estimate that the Company would report ~$1.10 of EPS from its project development business. Comparable solar companies with a sizable project business trade at an earnings multiple of 25x or higher. For example, Sunpower currently trades at a multiple of near 30x FY 2015 earnings. Assuming a relatively conservative multiple of 20x FY 2015 EPS, I estimate SUNE’s project development business to be worth $22 per share. Thus, SUNE’s project development business by itself is almost worth the current share price. I estimate the remaining components of SUNE’s business (e.g. Terraform, Samsung JV, Semi business) to be worth an additional ~$15.00 per share. Putting it all together, I estimate that SUNE is worth $37 per share on a combined basis. This represents a 67% premium to the current share price of $22.17 (as of March 10th). Thus, I would recommend going long SUNE at the current price level.",1433357651

Just a few extra minutes makes a difference if you do it often enough.<p>One decision that give us confidence we will be able to split the system back out again was to use the stuartsierra/component library.

To simplify (and expose a flaw in the case[1]), assume a bank is open 9am to 5pm (8 hours). They&#x27;d expect to see 46(.4, but let&#x27;s round) people in a day.<p>So there&#x27;s two factors: flow rate and service time.<p>FLOW RATE:<p>Those people aren&#x27;t coming in the door every 10.3 minutes: they&#x27;re all coming in at 9:00 before work, 12:00 on their lunch breaks, or 4:45 right before closing. So you&#x27;d see 15-20 people all working through the doors within 10-20 minutes of each other. Ouch! This is modeled in queue theory as a Poisson distribution of arrival times.<p>SERVICE TIME:<p>Again, we&#x27;re dealing with averages and distributions, but this time it&#x27;s exponential. For every person who comes in with a check to deposit (let&#x27;s say that takes 3m), there&#x27;s another extreme case (let&#x27;s say someone who wants to deposit $2,500 in Canadian pennies). As someone in the back of the line, you have to wait for all customers before you to be served before it&#x27;s your turn.<p>All of a sudden you&#x27;re in a 29-person line and waiting 5 hours. THAT math makes sense: 29 people × 10 minutes per person = 4.8 hours.<p>THE FLAW [1]<p>Of course, this queue model is continuous: the bank doesn&#x27;t open or close (as most banks do). Moreover, arrival times are deterministic: you can model based on a distribution, but you could quickly measure expected arrival times.<p>Process efficiency and queue theory are interesting topics. My favorite case is Toyota&#x27;s six sigma production line engineers helping a NYC food kitchen cut wait times from 90 minutes to 18 minutes with simple adjustments:<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/27/nyregion/in-lieu-of-money-toyota-donates-efficiency-to-new-york-charity.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/27/nyregion/in-lieu-of-money-...</a>",1433357137

That&#x27;s what I call devops, maybe I have the wrong definition though.<p>The argument about Ajax coming from Microsoft is a bit shallow. (Sorry that&#x27;s all the effort I felt like putting into it at the moment.) Here are a couple other thoughts along the same vein:<p>1. Microsoft has done extensive research into many areas of tech that are just now blooming, such as mobile and tablet computing. They had a general purpose mobile OS with multiple third party app-stores before any of the modern industry players. They had tablets. I think the industry caught up to Microsoft while they were busy making money elsewhere.<p>2. Look how quickly Microsoft can pivot into doing the kinds of things that Amazon AWS, Google <i>and</i> Apple are doing. I think it&#x27;s a testament to how &quot;there&quot; their platform is already.<p>> ...closed has a very large downside...<p>It can be a huge upside too. Developers have been making lots of money off of tightly controlled, closed software platforms like iOS and Windows for a long time.<p>The web is the only <i>completely</i> free open source &quot;platform&quot; that I can think of that is a huge hit with programmers and that people generally use.

But making that scalable is actually pretty difficult.<p>The first difficulty (and we&#x27;ve confirmed this and talked about the problem multiple times with directors of product at Twitter) is finding what the &quot;best&quot; stuff is.<p>We tried some time ago doing that for news - can we just algorithmically find the best tweets with regard to topic x? Even given full API access, the answer is either &quot;not really&quot; or &quot;yes, but austenallred and his team aren&#x27;t good enough programmers to figure it out.&quot;<p>There simply aren&#x27;t enough inputs - it&#x27;s the same reason Google has always struggled at real-time news. There are favorites and retweets, but those are largely a function of how big someone&#x27;s following is. Some guy walking on the street taking amazing photos will never have as many retweets as CNN, even if you try to control for the number of followers, or measure retweets as a function of the number of followers somehow.<p>Then even if you could get that, the tweets aren&#x27;t always analyzed in the right context. Run that type of analysis and the top tweet is likely to be a joke tweet or something like &quot;OMG I&#x27;m praying for Boston.&quot;<p>The best solution that we can come up with is crowdsourcing the finding and curation of tweets. It&#x27;s working OK, but there&#x27;s a long way to go. Basically we let everyone find and submit tweets, tag them with specific topics, and then upvote/downvote and fact-check for accuracy. (for details on how it works, see <a href=""https://grasswire.com/about"" rel=""nofollow"">https://grasswire.com/about</a>)<p>Once you add a couple lines of text, you can turn the raw firehose of Twitter into something that can be consumed by somebody like my mom. That, I think, it a really big deal. It&#x27;s working fairly well for news right now, and as more people join and submit it gets better. Our hopes are that we can expand into different verticals, and create daily digests of the best stuff with regard to topic x that you can consume in 30 seconds.",1433355771

This makes Cygwin a really poor choice for making binaries you want to distribute as standalone programs.<p>Aside from that, Cygwin tries to hard to be a complete Unix environment on Windows, whereas midipix just gives you enough to use interfaces that were standardized in POSIX as a reasonable, uniform API for all operating systems to provide.

He got hold of the leaflet that the detained men were distributing\n  and had it translated into English. He was astonished to find that it\n  was in fact a scholarly critique against the Iraqi prime minister,\n  Nouri al-Maliki, that tracked the corruption rife within his cabinet.\n  \n  &quot;I immediately took that information and ran to the officer to explain\n  what was going on,&quot; Manning later explained. &quot;He didn&#x27;t want to hear\n  any of it … he told me to shut up and explain how we could assist\n  the [Iraqi] police in finding MORE detainees.&quot;\n  ...\n</code></pre>\nThe USA was cooperating in arresting innocent Iraqi civilians (and subjecting them to brutal torture when arrested). This is <i>illegal</i>. Under civilian and military law, illegal orders must be refused and reported. Manning had a legal duty to report the illegal orders. If Manning had not reported this, it would be a crime. Being told to ignore it doesn&#x27;t change that.<p>If you&#x27;re pissed off about criminals ruining the reputation and effectiveness of the USA Armed Forces, and you should be, you need to be mad at the officers and soldiers and leaders who committed the crimes not the messenger who told you about it.",1433355265

Instead of playing to their medium&#x27;s strengths, these studios go through great pains to emulate what Hollywood gets naturally: emotive characters, good looking lighting, spectacular locations. It&#x27;s a very literal attempt to imitate another established, successful medium, and because it gets some results, it&#x27;s popular, despite the fact it&#x27;s very expensive and brushes aside many of the benefits that games get naturally.<p>Games can be much more immersive than movies can.

9654640,comment,9652893,9652893,0,0,bad_user,,,"I do agree with this article. We are working on a project based on a micro-services architecture and my experience matches.<p>First of all splinting functionality in multiple services is really hard and the first version of your architecture is probably flawed. It&#x27;s also really hard to establish the responsibilities of each component, the boundaries, whereas it is really easy to take shortcuts that invalidate the modularity or the re-usability of those components.<p>Of course, these wouldn&#x27;t be such big of a deal, except that refactoring becomes really difficult, because refactoring now often involves changes in how these services communicate and moving responsibilities around. Also, we are often talking about teams of more than two or three people, since two or three people will almost always choose to execute a monolith first - so in such teams the responsibilities are often divided between people, with people having an incomplete view of the whole system, so refactoring across the whole stack becomes a real bitch - next to impossible actually if the management or the clients are not acquainted with how software development works, as the development of new features is always preferred over dealing with technical debt (non-software folks do not understand technical debt).<p>Therefore I agree wholeheartedly with what is being said. It&#x27;s not that micro-services don&#x27;t work, however you need very senior people that know how to design such systems and you still have to throw away the first version of the entire system. And if you think you&#x27;re one of those people that think they get it, but never had a failure, then have some patience, as you&#x27;ll get there :-)",1433355115

I&#x27;m not 100% sure what midipix is doing in this regard, but my advice on the project (I&#x27;m the primary author/maintainer of musl libc, which midipix is using) has been not to worry about making arbitrary functions work after fork, but only supporting the things that POSIX requires to work. My view in general is that fork should be phased out, but posix_spawn is not sufficiently powerful yet to replace all uses of fork+exec -- it can&#x27;t do advanced uid changes, setsid, resource limits, etc., and posix_spawn can&#x27;t be used effectively from an async signal context because the API (attributes and file actions) inherently involves allocation.",1433354916

The app then uses the incoming stream of tweets to provide realtime coverage on an event that was algorithmically detected.",1433354718

The employees are also the customers. This means you can trust everyone&#x27;s judgement about decisions to a large extent and you can afford to skimp on user research and not have it overly impact the product. If you&#x27;re making a SAAS tool for developers, then a lot of hard design stuff becomes easy.<p>2. The metrics for success are very clear. If everyone has agreed on a common goal and it&#x27;s easy to evaluate yourself based on that goal, then everyone can work productively with a minimum of discussion. Backend services tend to work this way. Once the API is defined, you&#x27;re judged on performance, uptime, usage and other fairly objective metrics.<p>3. The business can be split into fairly modular components with strong contracts between each component. If you only need to communicate at the boundary, then you have enough bandwidth to do it remotely. A lot of ad tech is this way where certain business functions become easy to abstract away from others. If you&#x27;re building a consumer facing product though, the line between sales and marketing say, is never rigidly defined and there&#x27;s fluid, complicated feedback loops between the two and ideally they should be co-located so they can collaborate in unpredictable ways.<p>Where interpersonal bonding becomes the most important is building consensus over risky decisions. If Bill proposes a wild and crazy idea that needs everyone&#x27;s buy-in but nobody thinks will work, if you don&#x27;t trust Bill, then you&#x27;re going to push back because you think it&#x27;ll be harmful for the company/team. However, if you&#x27;ve spent a lot of time with Bill and understand the way he thinks and believe he might be crazy like a fox, then you might jump on board even if you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll work because Bill is awesome.",1433354421

LOOP has a full page of syntax.
<a href=""http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_loop.htm#loop"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_loop...</a><p>What you think has 'no' syntax, is the syntax for s-expressions. S expressions are relatively trivial, but not every s-expression is a valid Lisp form. S-expressions are a syntax for DATA.<p>The syntax of Lisp, the programming language, is described on top of s-expressions. Syntax is concerned with the structure of valid expressions of a language. So you have an additional layer of syntax which describes, on top of s-expressions, the syntax of Lisp.<p>There is some basic syntax:<p>* data like numbers, strings are valid Lisp programs<p>* function calls are valid Lisp programs. Function calls have a non-trivial syntax with rest, optional and keyword args, lambda functions, ...<p>* special forms like CATCH, FLET, IF, QUOTE, SETQ, ... all have their defined syntax<p>* macro calls, here the macro has to implement the syntax specified in the standard. users can do with their macros what they want.<p>For example<p><pre><code>   (if (foo-p) (this) (that) (these))
</code></pre>
is a syntax error, though it is a valid S-expression.<p>Similar<p><pre><code>   (loop for i below 10 (print i))
</code></pre>
is also wrong. Correct would be for example<p><pre><code>   (loop for i below 10 do (print i))

</code></pre>
So, what you may want is to remove the data syntax (s-expressions) from Lisp and replace it with some other layer of syntax that is not based on prefix parentheses-heavy s-expressions.<p>There are lots of languages that have different syntactical approaches. Lisp has its own, which makes it slightly unusual (the syntax is used to support the code-is-data paradigm), less popular, but also makes sure that it will find its users - those users who want a language with a flexible syntax (one that can be extended by the developer) on top of a simple data syntax.",1265302789

While public librarians in Britain are also expected to have a postgraduate qualification, that doesn't mean very much here and librarians aren't particularly well paid unless they are heads of service. An experienced librarian would expect to earn about half what an experienced software developer or systems administrator would - indeed, they would be fortunate to earn more than a junior developer on their first year in the job.<p>As an indication of their status here, a study published by the British Psychological Society in 2006 suggested that librarians are amongst the most stressed and frustrated workers. In the study, librarians themselves described feelings of severe boredom, a lack of control over their careers and insufficient opportunities to exercise their skills. As a heavy library user myself, this news story gelled strongly with the perception I have of librarians - intelligent people with very little to do, shuffling about the place with the demeanour of a lackadaisical hound, looking for something to puncture their tedious routine.",1265302124

It’s an extremely deep program – the deepest I’m very familiar with – full of all kinds of little thoughtful touches that make it smooth to operate for experienced users.

Many of these tools have literally barely changed in 15 years, even though users’ needs and hardware tools have changed dramatically: digital cameras have become ubiquitous and much better, etc.<p>I don’t have much use for Photoshop haters, but I’m deeply saddened that Adobe hasn’t faced much real innovative competition, and the whole image editor field has kind of stagnated as a result.",1265300856

At one point, though, Larry realized that I'd be a better fit in the Mac group, and introduced me to Andy Hertzfeld. Andy (the ""soul"" of the Mac software group) showed me some demos that were so amazing that I somehow thought that they didn't really need me--that the software was almost done! But I was impressed and intrigued, and mulled it over...<p>Meanwhile, I went to interview at VTI. The people there were wonderful. I'd be working with folks I knew and respected, and Doug even offered me a $15K signing bonus, a huge amount of money for a recent college graduate. I'd be working on advanced chip design tools, a new area for me, and it would be an interesting challenge. So I accepted the job. That was Thursday.<p>On Friday evening, I got a phone call. ""Bruce, it's Steve. What do you think about Apple?"" It was Steve Jobs. ""Well, Steve, Apple's cool, but I accepted a job at VTI.""<p>""You did what? Forget that, you get down here tomorrow morning, we have a lot more things to show you. Be at Apple at 9am."" Steve was adamant. I thought I'd go down, go through the motions, and then tell him that I'd made up my mind and was going to VTI.<p>Steve switched on the Reality Distortion Field full-force. I met with seemingly everyone on the Mac team, from Andy to Rod Holt to Jerry Manock to the other software engineers, and back to Steve. Two full days of demos, drawings of the various designs, marketing presentations--I was overwhelmed.<p>On Monday I called Doug Fairbairn at VTI and told him I had changed my mind.<p>I was going to join Apple, where we would change the world with a little computer called the Macintosh.

Can we state a computational definition rather than a definition in terms of satisfaction of cultural standards? We undervalue a lot of mental attributes - consistency of thought, sensitivity to subtle differences in concepts, patience, self-reflection, the ability to ""go meta"" etc. which cannot be detected by the rough and rigid abstract problem solving required by low-level Math (e.g. the Math problems which would qualify prodigies).<p>I am highly turned off by the idea that we can't ""become smart"" after an early age. I feel like I ""got smart"" after I started playing go, I feel like I ""got smart"" after I learned category theory.

228350,comment,228233,228233,0,0,yelsgib,,,"People vary in mental attributes. Let's get this out of the way right now. It -has to be the case-. We should obviously remain agnostic about what these attributes are (for instance, I would be hard pressed to say that ""good memory"" is even genetic because it is hard to disambiguate ""memory software"" from ""memory hardware"" in the brain).<p>Cultures screen for genetic attributes at a young age. This is not necessarily a good thing, but it just happens to be the case. Attractive children are treated differently. ""Bright"" children are treated differently. ""Slow/inattentive"" children are treated differently.<p>The sum of genetic attribute and cultural reaction to that attribute produces higher-order attributes which are consumed by new cultures, etc.<p>There is an academic culture of Mathematics. To participate, you need to have had the right experiences (enabled by the right genetics, pre-conditions, and cultural/socio-economic starting-point). People like MIT's Daniel Kane or Reid Barton were made-and-born.<p>So no, you can't become part of the culture of mathematics if you're not. Sorry, they're very picky. They also have a lot of resources (people to talk to, seminars to attend, journals which are expensive) which you can't have if you're not in the club.<p>Another unfortunate thing is that new math research really has to be presented in terms that ""old math"" can understand. E.g. constructivist mathematics struggles to get widespread approval. Adoption of ZFC axioms seems arbitrary in some senses (the C part).<p>So what does it mean to do ""good"" research? You need to create a result and argue it. Creation requires resources, argument requires facility with standards and ears to listen. Without acceptance into the community, you have neither.<p>That's one definition, anyway.<p>Do you just want to develop truth for yourself? Do you want to understand math deeply?<p>The fact is that there are many people who are extremely gifted in terms of genetic skills, who can do good math, but who don't quite ""fit the mold"" (trivial example: people with tremendous visuo-spatial reasoning abilities vs. people with tremendous pure-abstraction symbolic-manipulation abilities). These people can still do good math. They just have to do it largely on their own and they may have trouble communicating it with others.<p>In short, it's insanely complicated and has to do with the marriage of genetics and -culture-, not nurture, per se. If you want deeper insights into this question, I recommend you look at the history of mathematics and mathematicians.<p>---<p>Anyway, if you want a good example of a non-stereotypical mathematician, I recommend you look at the autobiography of Grothendiek. Good read.",1214465534
228349,comment,228233,228233,0,0,cperciva,,,"<i>Can people who are not inherently 'gifted', start with an immense interest in math at a mid-point in their life, and still go on to make meaningful and significant contributions to the field?</i><p>Probably not.<p><i>In other words, is precocity a prerequisite to doing good work in Math?</i><p>Maybe, depending on whether you by ""precocity"" you mean ""demonstrated precocity"".<p>Intelligence is something you either have or don't have -- and while there's still debate about how much of intelligence is genetic (25%?  50%?  75%?) it's clear that the nurture which is most important is that which takes place before age 5, when the brain is still at its most plastic.  Consequently, I would say that anyone who is not gifted when they're 5 years old is unlikely to have a significant mathematical impact.<p>However, not everybody with intellectual gifts demonstrates them early.  Mathematics is a field known for child prodigies, not because it's particularly suited to prodigies, but rather because mathematics prodigies tend to get noticed.  Some fields, like mathematics or chess, have little knowledge required before intellect can be applied; others, such as chemistry or biology, require years of prerequisite study.  Moreover, just like chess prodigies, the abilities of a mathematics prodigy are obvious and unarguable, while a remarkable writer is still likely to be rejected by his first 19 publishers -- and what 9 year old writer is going to send his manuscript to 20 publishers?<p>In short: You have to be smart to do make a significant contribution to mathematics, and I don't believe that people can ""become smart"" past a very early age.  However, it's possible for someone to be smart despite not having been recognized as such, depending on which fields his intellect is applied against.  Finally, it's definitely possible for someone who is smart but has never done well in mathematics to make a contribution to mathematics -- if he can develop the interest which is necessary for him to apply his intellect appropriately.<p>Is this a useful answer?  I have some other ideas about intelligence and IQ and the Putnam and flashes of insight floating around, but I'm not entirely certain how to explain them -- and given that news.yc stories don't stay on the front page for long, I thought I should post what I could promptly rather than waiting for everything else to crystallize.",1214465526

I spent a lot of time figuring how to get away from people, because they wanted me to do things, and I wanted to go back to the castle in my mind.  Only recently I figured out that people actually take materialism, life achievements, jobs, dress code, peer esteem, education, and so forth seriously.  I had mostly figured that people were putting on a show, kind of having fun pretending to be serious about their lives.  Oh the horror! -- like a bad novel -- everyone actually cares about clothes and money.<p>I know what you mean though about cities sending a message.  I used to ignore what groups of people think, for reasons of principle, because human nature doesn't scale.  But then I got the naivete cauterized out of me, and so now I pay attention to these messages, even though I don't entirely like being tuned into them.  I'm not sure if I go along with the messages, maybe I'm neutral or slightly against (for reasons of principle).<p>In any case, I think ambition is good, because the human condition can be improved.

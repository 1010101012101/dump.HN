I love it, and I've played it all through the night twice now.<p>I was a magic play way back in the day, but eventually got irritated about having to either buy new cards each time an expansion came out, or fall behind players who had the newer, more powerful cards.  Fortunately, Dominion has everyone drawing from the same cards, so this particular problem won't happen.",1261806892

The people most likely to be interested in and seek out Android phones and Android apps are also precisely the people most likely to be in O'Reilly's target market.

That allocation process also has many of the same <i>safe-guards</i> you mention.<p>The part of the metaphor that is completely incorrect, is that democracy is a truth finding system at all! You can not vote the law of gravity out of existence, for example. As a truth finding tool, democracy is only as strong as the education of its members, and even then, it provides no strict framework for judging quality or correctness of results.<p>In that sense, democracy has little at all to do with science. It is merely a tool for managing and controlling human actions.",1261805109

1015739,comment,1015684,1015684,0,0,Elepsis,,,"I just read <i>Outliers</i> yesterday, conveniently enough, so the chapter is fresh on my mind. While Greenspun certainly refutes <i>a</i> thesis quite effectively, I don't think it's actually the thesis of the chapter he's discussing.<p>First of all, Gladwell does not at any point claim that American or Canadian pilots are ""the best"" due to the power distance index--in fact, he doesn't claim that at all. If you look at the book, the U.S. has the fifth-lowest index (lower being ""better"" for these purposes), behind New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and Ireland, and he never says anything in the chapter that even implies that American pilots are best.<p>Nor does he say anywhere that the power distance index is the primary cause of plane crashes. Indeed, he explicitly says that any accident is caused by 6-7 small mistakes building on one another without being caught--something that could quite possibly be caused by inexperience, as Greenspun notes--but which can be exacerbated by two people in the cockpit unable to communicate in a direct way.<p>So while I think the article is a useful and interesting theory about differences in rates of crashes (though it should be noted that U.S. airlines do not have an overwhelmingly better safety record than, say, major European ones [1]), it is ultimately another in a series of ""hey, let me overgeneralize what Malcolm Gladwell is saying and back it up with minor factual gaffes I found in the book"" articles.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.planecrashinfo.com/rates.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.planecrashinfo.com/rates.htm</a>",1261804847

1015729,comment,1015684,1015708,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>Come to think of it, is the USA a major net exporter of airline-pilot talent?</i><p>Dunno, but I have a hunch the answer is yes.  (Not ""net"", but we probably do export.)<p>I was very surprised when I was flying from Hong Kong to Shanghai on Dragonair a few months ago; both the captain and first officer were white guys with American accents.  Not what I expected from an airline that only flies from mainland China to Hong Kong.  (I also flew on Cathay Pacific on that trip, and the flight crew had British accents.  They were not Chinese, which is what surprised me.)<p>So I assume there are some pilots that choose to work for a foreign carrier rather than a US carrier.  It makes sense, because English is an important skill, and the pay must be about the same.  If my work life would become less stressful by moving to Hong Kong, I would gladly do it.  I don't see why pilots would be any different.",1261804058

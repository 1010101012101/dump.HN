9502313,comment,9502006,9502006,0,0,LarryMade2,,,"Well a framework has done all the heavy listing, you add in your stuff and can be good to go in an extremely short time.  Drawbacks are you are married to the framework, have to keep it updated as well as live with its idiosyncrasies and quirks (sometimes you just cant easily do something in a framework and have to kludge it in..., and it will probably get worse as time goes on).  Another fear is that the framework may end-of-life or go through some massive refactor at sometime and you would have to re-configure to project to keep going.<p>Pure PHP is good but takes time to develop code to something mature, you will get maximum flexibility (you will eventually get what you want), but you are dependent on your skills and research.  Pure PHP can be safe, just you have to research and implement whatever safe code/practices you need.<p>Kind of depends on what you are going for.  If you want to fiddle, try both.  If you want something that would be complex quick, probably a framework.  If you want something that you can&#x27;t see done with a framework and are willing to put in the time and effort, pure PHP would be a good route.<p>I read if it is short term good to go with a framework, long term, you should expect to end-up with something more robust (start with framework, build into a more stable long term pure PHP for the long haul).",1430953135

If the claim is rejected because the insurer figures out it&#x27;s Uber-related, then Uber&#x27;s policy kicks in — but the driver&#x27;s almost certainly going to have his personal insurance policy cancelled, and in some cases be investigated for fraud.<p>What?  Has this ever happened before?  Surely by now there would be specific examples of this taking place, if it were indeed a real thing.<p>> CP: Yeah, not really — when they take UberX into a new market like Philly, they start off by paying drivers a lot.

My experience mirrors that of the reporter. Towards the end, I would only drive during surge pricing hours, as that was the only way to make a reasonable net hourly wage.<p>I have no problem hailing an Uber - they are really, really cheap. However, it&#x27;s a raw deal for drivers. Uber turns a blind eye to driver-contractors driving without commercial vehicle insurance. It has to, as the additional cost (which is pushed onto the driver) would cause the driver&#x27;s hourly rate to plummet even further. In addition, there is no way to purchase commercial insurance on an hourly basis - therefore part-time drivers would be squeezed out. The flat-rate $1 safe rides fee causes low-distance fares to be even more unprofitable, even when many short trips are already a bad deal due to the overhead involved in each pickup and drop-off.<p>To fix this, Uber should probably cover drivers with an on-demand commercial policy while they are logged into the app. The flat per-ride fee should go away. And while I doubt this is going to happen, Uber should probably also reduce the commission they take per ride.",1430951660

Many in the US us GSM cellular devices hooked to GPS units, but from what I&#x27;ve read that it is not legal to use cellular devices from high altitude balloons.<p>The best approach in the US is to get a Technician class amateur radio license (and if you are the kind of person who can put together a decent payload for a high altitude balloon, you can learn enough to easily pass the radio license test in a couple evenings). You can then use amateur radio frequencies and equipment for your telemetry, and you are even allowed to build your own radios. A transmitter can be pretty simple and cheap to build if you are willing to transmit your data in Morse code (like, a transistor, a crystal, and a handful of resistors and capacitors and such). If you are sticking an Arduino or Pi or some such in there, that can easily convert the data to Morse and send it, and automatically decoding it on the ground with a computer is not hard.<p>Everything else I&#x27;ve seen seems to be either illegal, or involves using unlicensed bands where you are legally limited to very low power which could be annoying (especially if your balloon lands far away from where you expected, and you are trying to track it down with radio direction finding). When you make licensed use of the ham bands, you can use a good amount of power (but only up to what is necessary to accomplish the mission).<p>In the UK, from what I&#x27;ve read, the ham option doesn&#x27;t work. Hams are not allowed to transmit from aircraft, and that includes balloons. Not sure what the best legal method of operating there is.<p>• What constraints there are on the balloon. In the US there are regulations on, among other things, total weight of the complete system, total weight of the payload, and on the size/weight ratios of the components of the payload, and on the strength of the ropes attaching the payload to the balloon.",1430951388

I know gold standard fans like to equate them, but they are not the same thing at all.<p>That&#x27;s a very interesting point!  I think I &quot;knew&quot; that they were different without ever putting it together like that.  It&#x27;s obviously true though, there were a number of years here in the US when you could own dollars but not the gold that the dollars supposedly represented.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102</a><p>> Gold and silver used as money were actually a form of barter.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I agree with that but it&#x27;s probably semantics.  Is gold &quot;money&quot; or &quot;commodity&quot; and why?  There&#x27;s no obviously right answer.  If people did bookkeeping in ounces of gold and paid their taxes in ounces of gold, doesn&#x27;t that make it &quot;money&quot; in the sense that we would use today?<p>> Fiat currency is resistant to such manipulation because no one can ever control enough of it to manipulate the economy. The government can create or destroy as much as it needs to.<p>So it&#x27;s not clear to me that granting the government (technically the Federal Reserve which is privately owned and truly only answers to its owners) control over the economy the way we have is actually a good thing.  You still have an entity that can manipulate prices and the economy, it&#x27;s just most people accept this as a good thing without any thought at all.  Most people probably still believe that the gold inside Fort Knox or the Federal Reserve banks are somehow meaningful and in some way related to our money; but they aren&#x27;t.  You&#x27;ve traded the possibility of someone manipulating the economy in a harmful way for the certainty that someone will manipulate the economy but with the outcome unknown at any time.<p>The Fed still does price fixing, by the way.  They fix the price of money, or as most people call it, the interest rate.  Because their balance sheet knows no limits they can buy or sell as much of anything as they want until the interest rate is the &quot;right&quot; one as decided by a bunch of people who don&#x27;t have a lot of connection to the real economy anymore.<p>You might argue that the Supreme Court is similar (unelected and generally unaccountable) but there&#x27;s a difference.  The people on the Supreme Court can make decisions based on existing law and precedent and legal arguments brought before them.  And it&#x27;s fairly easy for the Congress to override their decisions if they&#x27;re particularly egregious since they publish opinions that explain their reasoning.<p>As it stands there&#x27;s really no feedback mechanism for the Federal Reserve short of writing new laws that change the entire system.  None is built in.  Sure they have to go before Congress twice a year, but they can&#x27;t be fired for policy opinions.  It&#x27;s a sweet gig if you can get it, but it&#x27;s kind of insane just how much power these folks wield and how little accountability they face for their actions.",1430950966

Since JavaScript will do the coercion for you automatically you can pretty much treat a date object as if it were a number.<p>This is basically a utility routine that I use for debugging messages to say how long an operation took.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of its use:<p><a href=""https://github.com/scripting/myWordEditor/blob/master/scripts.js#L256"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/scripting/myWordEditor/blob/master/script...</a><p>It&#x27;s especially nice because JavaScript automatically does real arithmetic on the division, so you get fractions of seconds displayed in the console.<p>I use this routine a lot. Helps me spot performance problems. Nice to have, not a crucial routine.<p>Hope this helps! ;-)",1430950588

It is not a wealth redistribution--more like a production capacity redistribution.<p>Naively attempting to do that using currency manipulation as your only tool seems doomed to failure, in my opinion.<p>I don&#x27;t care to argue for or against basic income at the moment, but presuming that it is to be implemented, the task cannot be accomplished with an alternate currency.  I think that ultimately, it will be necessary to threaten highly productive owners of capital with the use of force unless they meet some portion of the consumption requirements of non-working individuals.<p>The producers would be taxed, at a cruelly high rate, such that if they sold a product that is both appealing and affordable for the people on basic income, they would break even on a cashflow basis, only losing some use of their productive capacity.  For some made-up, spewed-out numbers, Apple is taxed $1G on the sale of 4 million of its fully-featured iPhones, at $250 cost and $750 retail--effectively taxing 50% of the profits--and recoups $1G in revenue from selling 20 million &quot;Nekhama iPhones&quot; (Nekkhamma is a Buddhist term) that cost $25 to make, and sell at $75.  Maybe it&#x27;s just the same guts as an iPhone 1, using a smaller chip feature size.  Or they could just tell that $1G to go piss off, and less prestigious manufacturers pick up the slack in the basic market.  Obviously, sales in the basic market could not trigger the onerous taxes, or the scheme wouldn&#x27;t work.",1430949615

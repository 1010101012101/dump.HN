1663281,comment,1662123,1662720,0,0,wazoox,,,"Well I've been a bit short and simplistic, but the fact is that whatever properties you give to God among the generally admitted ones, or even if you limit God to a simple demiurge, you need hints, evidences, or in the absence of material evidence some logical argument.<p>However there is no hint of the existence of any form of God; nor is there any logical necessity for his existence.
When something has no evidence to exist and no logical reason to exist, of course you may always fancy that it does, but this is empty of meaning or use. Therefore I pretend that ""agnosticism"" is a lack of decision. Either you want to believe, and do so, or you don't and then you're atheist and there's no need to beat around the bush.<p>Then of course I'll admit that I'd rather be confrontational than gently neutral, because there is so much to despise, hate about organised religion, that it even poisons good rationalists minds :)",1283630095

Rightly or wrongly, economic globalization's image didn't end that year untarnished.<p>The world's a really complex system, even limited to just the human-systems part of it, and the <50 miles from satellite orbits down to deep-sea drilling that concerns said humans.  So in forecasting and speculating on the future, we can't help but project our own fears and hopes - in this case, Thiel is a capitalist/investor who makes a long case for going long on the world economy, with some Biblical quotes and economic history to make it interesting, if not quite convincing.  Too many false dichotomies are given - I think it's a good bet the future will not run like a decision tree.<p>In particular, Thiel wrestles with the fairly old internal contradictions of capitalism that many other thinkers have, some much more in depth.  To use one more Biblical reference, the Rapture for globalization is a totally ""flat"" world of complete freedom for labor and capital (and technology, but presumably not land).  Global capitalism runs, shuffles, or stumbles towards that end, with much of its participants heedless of the journey, never mind its destination.<p>For example, since capitalism's purpose is to accumulate capital for its own sake, it cannot help but be global (early on, slave trade/colonialism), and it cannot help but work against itself in the long run (We'll up profit margins by outsourcing!  But wait, then those outsourcers will get richer, and compete to squeeze our own profit margins.  Yah, but then they'll outsource too!  But wait, the planet is finite...).  While it is a very resilient economic system, what might follow it as its contradictions come fully into play is far from clear.<p>As an aside, here's someone else who's view on the current globalization situation is, I've found, comprehensive and coherent:<p><a href=""http://www.iwallerstein.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iwallerstein.com/</a>",1283629881
1663274,comment,1662729,1662907,0,0,patio11,,,"Just an FYI to justify my East Asian Studies degree: the Emperor as God-on-Earth Shintoism is largely a creation of the Japanese government and elites, extending from the late Meiji era (i.e. a couple hundred years after genociding the Christians) into the military junta that was ended by WWII.  Shinto previously existed in Japan as a set of diverse minor traditions and local legends, and would have been mostly unrecognizable as a religion prior to it being used as a founding myth to justify the new regime.<p>Looking at the reading list for the course I learned that in (almost a decade ago now), I think the source is probably W. Scott Morton, ""Japan Its History and Culture"", but don't quote me on that.<p>Fun historical trivia note: the Japanese constitution forbids government support of religious schools.  The reason for this is late 19th-century American anti-Catholicism.  How the heck did that happen?  Well, Protestant nativists afraid that Irish & etc Catholics were going to breed quickly and overwhelm ""real"" Americans passed a series of so-called Blaine Amendments in American states (failing at the national level), which forbid giving money to sectarian schools with the express purpose of forbidding Catholics to fund their schools with tax dollars.  Some genius in MacArthur's constitutional drafting committee copy/pasted one of them into the Japanese Constitution.<p>For additional potent irony, I'd lay even money on the Blaine Amendments being declared unconstitutional (in the US, obviously) within the next few years.  They will then survive only in 21st century Japan, protecting it from 19th century Irish immigrants.",1283629843

My goal was to publish something (anything, anywhere) before I died. I collected only massive piles of rejection notes for years. I cannot explain exactly why I had the confidence to be sending off my short stories at the age of 19 to, say, The New Yorker, or why it did not destroy me when I was inevitably rejected. I sort of figured I’d be rejected. But I also thought: “Hey – somebody has to write all those stories: why not me?” I didn’t love being rejected, but my expectations were low and my patience was high. (Again – the goal was to get published before death. And I was young and healthy.) It has never been easy for me to understand why people work so hard to create something beautiful, but then refuse to share it with anyone, for fear of criticism. Wasn’t that the point of the creation – to communicate something to the world? So PUT IT OUT THERE. Send your work off to editors and agents as much as possible, show it to your neighbors, plaster it on the walls of the bus stops – just don’t sit on your work and suffocate it. At least try. And when the powers-that-be send you back your manuscript (and they will), take a deep breath and try again. I often hear people say, “I’m not good enough yet to be published.” That’s quite possible. Probable, even. All I’m saying is: Let someone else decide that. Magazines, editors, agents – they all employ young people making $22,000 a year whose job it is to read through piles of manuscripts and send you back letters telling you that you aren’t good enough yet: LET THEM DO IT. Don’t pre-reject yourself. That’s their job, not yours. Your job is only to write your heart out, and let destiny take care of the rest.<p>Elizabeth Gilbert, NY Times Best Selling author of ""Eat, Pray, Love""<p><a href=""http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/writing.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/writing.htm</a>",1283628558

1663231,comment,1662086,1663033,0,0,kelnos,,,"> Countries that have prohibitions on firearms have fewer firearms. It's a huge difference in the numbers and that's an example of prohibition working.<p>Who cares?  You're working from a premise that having fewer firearms is a good thing.  I'm not going to say I disagree, but I'm not sure I agree either.<p>The real metric is whether or not firearm-related crimes are significantly reduced in countries where there are prohibitions on firearms.<p>There's also the question of whether firearm use matters in some crimes.  Take these two scenarios:<p>1.  Burglar commits armed (firearms) robbery of a house.  Owners of the house are suitably frightened but give in to the burglars.  Stuff is stolen but no one gets hurt.<p>2.  Burglar commits armed (knives) robbery of a house.  Owners of the house are suitably frightened but give in to the burglars.  Stuff is stolen but no one gets hurt.<p>They are essentially the same crime, but now #2 is not lumped in with the ""firarms-related crime"" group.<p>And let's try keeping #1 as it is, but now #2 is this:<p>2'.  Burglar commits armed (knives) robbery of a house.  Owners of the house think a knife isn't too scary and fight back.  One owner gets stabbed and dies.<p>I don't know about the frequency of stuff like this, but it's certainly not a quick ""look at the numbers"" thing to decide which is better.",1283628291

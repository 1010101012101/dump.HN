3901199,comment,3889463,3891217,1,0,2pasc,,,"Thanks for participating in the discussion. I completely understand what you are talking about regarding attracting engineers. It's so crazy currently in Silicon Valley!<p>I am not saying that you should not be ambitious. It's just that I see so many people boasting huge vision with no traction at all. As you can see in the email above, TheFacebook was indeed a hot website with amazing traction. Their ambition (social graph, platform, etc...) came later, and so many times entrepreneurs think that they need to have the big vision first when their MVP is not used at all.<p>In the case of Ark, I believe that you have a very interesting product, and that being where you are right now is a very interesting position. I wish you all the success in the world to bring that to fruition and be able to get the traction you need to go to the next level. Good luck! I would love to have coffee with you and hear more about it if you are in the city!",1335563945

I have no twitter followers and no one ever really read my blogs and generally posts on sites like reddit are autobanned.  The closest I could do would be to go on Facebook and almost everyone on there is family.  They would probably react the way they usually do to my Facebook posts which is ""wow, I forgot that guy was on Facebook? He is so weird"" with an addition of ""who cares"".<p>Also, its easier to write one article a day than it is to say push a major feature per day.  Also it is easier to measure and break off writing goals than software goals.<p>I don't have a problem doing work every day, but I do feel like some days are vastly more productive than others.

I disagree about portability though.<p>It is awesome to have different dialects of clojure, which are the same wherever possible, and vary only where they have to.<p>The purpose of a different dialect is to take advantage of a different host vm/language. Enforcing uniformity across all dialects would preclude this.<p>But my point is, even accounting for variations, having a uniform representation for programming primitives across all these hosts is a huge win.<p>Its great that I'll be able to play with, take advantage of Lua without learning the details of its language. Instead of learning new syntax and semantics, all I need to know is the precise details of how this clojure dialect is different. This is much easier and more accessible than starting from scratch. I don't want to have to learn these languages in order to use them.<p>Finally, given the trend towards declarative representation, I expect a lot more than algorithms to be portable.

At the risk of offending more than a few, there's what some have come to call the ""feminization"" of American men.  Maybe it's a result of the ability to sue anyone for anything, I don't know.  But there's a very distinct characteristic to men (an women) from other cultures that will place the uber-polite American men and women at a disadvantage in certain situations.<p>Here's an example that isn't really about what I am talking about but speaks to the cultural and environmental differences:<p>Here in Los Angeles it is not too uncommon to see people crossing a street without even looking right or left and without continuously scanning for cars as they cross the street.  I've also seen (kids!!!!) crossing the street running.  Now, go down to Buenos Aires and try that on for size.  Or do it in Rome.  Or cross a bike path in Amsterdam without looking. You'll land yourself in a hospital, if you are lucky.<p>It's the same out in Manhattan, of course.<p>Non-scientific, non-extensive observation, but I don't think the lack of assertiveness has anything to do with language but rather culture.

The ClojureScript compiler _is_ running on the JVM (in Clojure). Why would you want to create a backend for the JVM for a language that tries to match a JVM language as closely as possible - and relies on the JVM for tooling?<p>I rocked back and forth for minutes. Please explain why you assume that someone considered this and why it wouldn't be nonsense?",1335561514

Hackers are <i>eager</i> to find things that work better, regardless of their source. One example that springs to mind is the use, in 3D graphics programs, of an archaic math construct called the 'quaternion'. The quaternion was the loser in a long-ago war with 'vectors', but this did not stop hackers from using the idea with the most value.<p>Another more ready example (as evinced by the frequent posts on HN about it) is Emacs. It's an <i>old</i> editor. And yet it still has it's adherents, and new converts.<p>But I hear <i>nothing</i> about people making anything in smalltalk environments. Nothing. Not even toys. One would think that if the language/environment was so powerful and the software freely available, that we would have seen <i>something</i> built on it. Heck, erlang is pretty esoteric (especially to those who don't hang out around here) but someone built CouchDB on erlang (and then abandoned it, but that's another story :).<p>In summary, I think there might be something wrong with Smalltalk that has nothing to do with economics.",1335561460

It could be because of ""stupid"" programmers that cannot adapt to Ruby, because of inertia, because it is fast to start with, because it has a more vibrant ecosystem than Ruby/RoR, because of large amounts of code already built with it used to bootstrap newer projects, because of lack of RoR publicity, because of just being there first, etc etc. Thing is: by usage and number-of-sites metrics, it is.",1335561410

3901056,comment,3899573,3900670,2,0,noduerme,,,"Let's assume a test that isn't culturally biased. The idea behind the test should be to determine the raw underlying intelligence of a person; culture shouldn't play into it at all. The fact that some IQ tests seem to discriminate - referring to the legal explanations above - appears to be a flaw in the tests given in those cases. If a test is biased toward a race or culture, then it's not an accurate measure of intelligence; we can't even call it an IQ test. It doesn't meet the definition of what most people are talking about or referring to when they say ""IQ test"" -- since ""IQ"" by definition is measured on a sliding scale in reference to the entire population.<p>For argument's sake let's assume a test that doesn't discriminate or give advantage to any given race or culture. How is that different from a coding test, other than that it requires more general interest and knowledge, and doesn't overly reward memorization of algorithms?",1335561353

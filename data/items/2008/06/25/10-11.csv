They want their code to show all the details, but hiding details is what programming is all about.  OCD people will make your project very late as they worry about all the special cases that aren't.",1214391509
227369,comment,227216,227216,0,0,wallflower,,,"All the companies I have worked at have enforced spaces by setting up the editor to translate tabs to 4 spaces. I never asked why. Some battles aren't worth fighting.<p>'Spaces instead of tabs' wasn't the near the near-religious fervour of which editor to use though (VSlick won at my 1st company - e.g. company bought group license - though you could buy your own fave). I guess if you spend all day working with a hammer, you want the best hammer for you. I've spent hundreds of my own to buy my own editor to use at work.",1214391417

227363,comment,227006,227006,0,0,edu,,,"Well, the first thing is that until Objective-J and Cappuccino are released they won't change the industry in any way, and then we will see.<p>One thing I don't understand is why <i>web</i> apps have to look like <i>desktop</i> apps? Browser/net and desktop are completely different environments, each with their own characteristics.   And trying to do a desktop-like web app brings two problems:<p>1. It fails in the uncanny valley: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_Valley"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_Valley</a>.<p>2. They use a lot more JS than it's needed, and while this is not a problem on computers it is in mobile devices. Do you really want a web app suck all the battery of your iPhone, even when it's not necessary?",1214390380

Any great programmer (like him) is expected to do that.\nBut, IMHO, when Steve Jobs talks about <i>taste</i> his mind operates on a whole different level.",1214390234

The rest was simply looking at the numbers and noticing (eventually) what 2 N^3, 20 N^2, and 80 N looked like.",1214389610

But they couldn't have started out saying ""hey, we're a platform for apps"".  So they solved a problem (namely, the ""I need to know more about my friends' lives & activities"" problem) first.  And THEN they became a platform.",1214389432

I can do better; therefore they should do better. :-)<p>EDIT: On second thought, maybe there is an aspect of security mindset here.  One of the assumptions I find to be very useful in dealing with security is the bad guys are at least as smart as I am.  It's not very far from here to saying ""the Amazonians working on SimpleDB should be at least as smart as me"".",1214388841

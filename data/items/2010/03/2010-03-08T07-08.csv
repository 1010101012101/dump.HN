1174945,comment,1173854,1174338,0,0,lambdom,,,"Well, you choose how you want to name your function. That you code in a functional style, or in python or in haskell has nothing to do with that. And the fact that you use high-level level function based on maths is still a choice of yours.<p>What I say is by using a functional style (might it be in java, c++, haskell, scheme, python, or whatever), it makes testing, threading and understanding things easier.<p>For instance, it's easier to test an immutable class since once it is created, it will never change.<p>Threading is also simplified since you don't have to think about your object being corrupted by 2 threads mutating it.<p>Understanding is simplified in the sense that it's easier to quickly get an idea of what an object is doing because it only has 1 state at a time.<p>But please, don't think I didn't understand your point about obscurely named function and bad code.. Often when people show functionnal code, they try to show how short the code is so they make it practically unreadable for the novices - which is indeed not the best way to show the vertue of FP.<p>""you'd be much better off writing it in Python."" => Nothing stop you from using FP in python :)",1268034208

1174939,comment,1172803,1174074,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> The buddhist's nirvana is the absence of desire and while they believe in reincarnation, they see it as a curse to those who are too much anchored to their wealth and earthly delights.<p>As a sidenote, I know Buddhism is quite popular in the West these days, but after spending time in Asia, I don't see it as superior in practice to the Western religions. The best of Buddhism, the most interesting and enlightening concepts make it to the West. But they have just as much silly superstition, social control, religious rank and hierarchy, and warriorship/violence in their history as the Western religions. Actually, some of the finest fighters of their era are the Shaolin and Honganji monks of China and Japan, who were at times much equivalently brutal to crusdaders and jihadists.<p>As for me personally, I think struggle is a good thing. I think all the most important and valuable aspects of life are struggle - living, thriving, growing. Childbirth, one of the heights of human experience, is a brutal struggle. Farming is struggle, hunting is struggle, cooking is struggle. Training to dance or sing or play an instrument is struggle. I'm with you on non-materialism as accumulating stuff isn't particularly effective, but I (personally) reject the notion that struggle is bad. All the best parts of life are a struggle or the fruits of struggle. I embrace struggle, I embrace suffering for worthy causes - suffering in exercise, in farming, in hunting, in cooking, in dancing, in having and rearing children. It's all struggle - I don't want nirvana, give me this world and its struggles and sufferings, and I'll embrace it fully.<p>> There is something wrong with you if you think that life needs to perpetuate violence for thrill's sake.<p>This I agree with, but I think the original commentor's point was a bit more nuanced than that. I think he was saying conflict is necessary at times for life, and he was also noting that people do enjoy observing conflict and drama playing out. Myself, I've got mixed feelings on this - you know, I much prefer baseball to American football for instance. I played linebacker in high school, but watching a 6'6 220 pound receiver catch a pass in the air and get destroyed by a 6'4 260 pound safety while he's largely helpless makes me cringe a little. The strategy aspect of American football I quite like, the brutality of it not so much. So I'm with you on some points, less so on others.",1268033816

And I'd love an open App Store, though I understand their reasons for keeping it locked down.  The worst barrier they have right now, IMO, is the single-carrier barrier, which I really think is flat-out wrong.  But the USA is rather backwards when it comes to cell phones.<p>As to the WalMart / other contrived analogy, which I admit my comment was rather lacking in content, lets try another comparison. The DS only plays DS games (especially with the DSi now, which loses the GBA slot).  However, not only is that the same restriction, it's even <i>worse</i> because getting permission to sell your game is an absolute nightmare if you're not big, and the development tools are far more expensive.<p>To make the comparison stronger, and the App Store's position worse, the DS has sold <i>three times</i> as many units than the iPhone, though probably not as many cartridges as apps.  But that's physical vs digital distribution for ya.  How often do you hear about the DS and its <i>far</i> tighter distribution chain, as opposed to the iPhone?  Granted, the App Store has been changing lately, but the criticism hasn't abated since day 1.<p>For WalMart in particular, I'd say it's closer to buying a DVD player from WalMart, and having it only play DVDs sold at WalMart.  It'd certainly suck for people trying to sell things, but they carry 99.9% of what people buy anyway, so most of the buyers won't mind (and it may be worth avoiding the huge amounts of porn that might appear there otherwise).  And there <i>are</i> other options, like Android phones, Blackberry / PalmOS based phones, etc, which match other retail options.",1268033554

1174924,comment,1173679,1174239,0,0,rdtsc,,,"Imagine having a best friend like you had when you were 5. You could play in the tree house, play video games all day, build stuff, ride bikes all across town, stay over their house, do everything together, talk about anything, once in a while have fights and arguments but then make up. Well it's kind of like that even when you are grown up.<p>The way the society is structured might help develop these friendships or might prevent them. For example, were I was growing up (in ex Soviet Union), the school was structured such that you could end up being in the same class with mostly the same people for 12 years. Not just the same school -- but the same class. So if you never move (more on that later), you would end up knowing the same 30 people very well. One or two of them might become your good friends.<p>Now school is just one factor, the other is how transient people are. It used to be that people would be born, grow up and live most of their lives in one city. That means you probably will still have your fiends from since you were 5 living in the same city. In some countries, people move more, mostly because of jobs I guess. It is very hard to form deep friendships when you are moving every 4 years. Yes, you have many acquaintances but not too many friends.<p>I thought about this quite a bit. By now I lived half of my life in the ""old world"" and half in US. I can still skype, chat and email back and forth with my childhood buddies, but it is just not the same. I think good friendships need real face to face contact. I am making friends at work, but there is always an apprehension and competitiveness involved. They'll never be the same kind of friends I had growing up.

At the risk of beating a dead horse with another contrived analogy, in my opinion dealing with the App Store as the only channel for apps is akin to buying a house and being forced to get all my furniture and housewares at Crate & Barrel.  On top of that, the house is built such that anything I buy from another retailer either won't fit in the door or might unexpectedly cause the roof to collapse.<p>I'll concede your point that real-world stores can be just as difficult to work with, if not even more so, but this doesn't change the fact that having the App Store as the sole arbiter of what's allowed is introducing artificial barriers to restrict consumer choice.  Even WalMart has to deal with competition from other distributors.",1268031843

In reality, federal surveillance was dramatically higher during the Cold War (modulo improved technology), and the idea of the strong unitary executive dates to the founding of the republic.

5384668,comment,5382891,5384525,10,0,unclebucknasty,,,"Not true. In fact, that's a pretty astounding statement.<p>Executive power has expanded greatly since 9/11. The PATRIOT Act alone vastly expanded law enforcement capabilities. Law enforcement, of course, being of the Executive and including the DOJ. In fact this thread likely wouldn't need to exist if not for the expansion of NSL under the PATRIOT Act. Many of the rights that we ceded as citizens were given over directly to the Executive.<p>Remember, the Executive branch is more than just the President, but includes all departments under his purview.<p>I think if there is a myth it is among those who believe that nothing has changed simply because some of these mechanisms (such as NSL and FISA) did exist prior to 9/11. But, in addition to new powers, it is the expansion, interpretation, and application of existing powers that have also represented a large share of the power grab. This started with Bush after 9/11 with his adherence to the theory of the strong unitary executive. This is when we began to see the letters of his attorneys, which re-interpreted existing powers much more broadly and sought to justify unprecedented Executive actions retroactively. That there was never a trial indicates that they were, in fact, successful in their claims to additional power.<p>Of course one can also point to launching pre-emptive wars as an unprecedented power grab--perhaps of the highest order.<p>And, essentially, these powers continue to expand under Obama, up to and including the remarkable justification of drone strikes on American citizens.",1363414718

For example, in smartphones, when apps get installed they define what permissions they need. If we assume the publisher of an app is not malicous, then their is no need for a typical user to need to know about this, and we can view it as the app saying ""these are the things I am going to access, if I try to access anything else, then I have probably been compromised"".<p>The smartphone implementation seems a bit to crude to be very effective in stopping malware, however there is no reason why we should not be able to make a more fine grained system.<p>For example, in the Linux world, we have apparmor, which does effectively the same, but is much more configurable. Still, this only requires the program to be honest at install time, and to not have write access to the apparmor configuration file; the user does not need to be aware of its existence.<p>The problem with these systems is that programs need to do things that we do not want malware to be able to do. For example, Chrome has an auto-update feature. If it gets compromised, then the malware can overwrite the executable just as easily (unless the OS enforces code signing). Say that the program wants to be able to create shortcuts on the desktop, and save data to the harddrive. Now, if it gets compromised, the malware can save itself to the harddrive, and create a shortcut on the desktop labeled ""Chrome.exe"".",1363414409

They have the engineering down to a science, and a launch like this would never happen for them. For starters, they would have done continuous internal beta testing, had a soft launch that would have caught these issues, and have actually engineered their cloud servers to scale, rather than act like individual WOW shards. Actual WOW shards are run across on multiple scalable servers, I should add. Blizzard also knows what they are doing.",1363414012

Being effective is difficult, especially if the task you're doing is difficult.  You have to just hammer away at it and iteratively get 1% better every time you take a swing.<p>In productivity, it's constantly holding yourself to a higher standard than you previously did.

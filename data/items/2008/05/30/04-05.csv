But now that you make me look at my habits it seems I prefer to get the full feed and then tell Safari to shorten them up. That way all the aggregated articles are similar within my groupings.<p>Clicking through isn't the issue for me. If it is a lengthy article I'll probably click through to see it as you intended... unless your site is so ad heavy it drives me away.<p>Now I'll have to go throw away all that lovely code I wrote to do the excerpts.",1212122279

In college I had a million freshman year, but it seemed that every year the number dwindled, but those remaining were that much better.  Now I'm in grad school and I only have like 3 friends, and I'm totally unsure as to how I would make more?  I don't understand how people moving to new places make any at all.<p>I'm also going to a school now that is more of a commuter school, so nobody lives close by.  I honestly think that if people lived close to school, then everybody would have more friends.",1212122119

I would have expected that other factors (one-time costs like session establishment) would dominate the overall latency, and the marginal cost of fetching 20 additional query results would be fairly small.",1212122108

204041,comment,203804,203820,0,0,silencio,,,"Having partial content (where it would be feasible to provide the full thing) in a feed annoys me because I have to click through not because I'm really interested in leaving a comment, but because I don't even know if it interests me that much because there's not enough information to make that decision. Especially with the feeds that at most just have a link to the full content in the feed (not talking about how it works with feeds from here and reddit and the like, which is something else altogether). It's so much faster to ignore content I don't care for and move on than having to open the link in my browser to do so.<p>If it's ads that are the problem, by all means, I'd prefer full content with tons of ads to partial content with none.<p>I usually unsubscribe to feeds providing only partial content, it's only a matter of time and how soon I find an alternative that has full content in their feeds.",1212121696

Do you think that's more enjoyable to read or scroll through?<p>Yes, I could have comissioned it as a feature-style article, which probably would have been half as long or less, but I really don't think it would have been as effective or readable as the profiles. For instance, the profiles allow you to easily skip over companies and sections you don't want to read, whereas a feature would force you to skim.<p>As for generating page views, it's unfortunate that this drives so much online journalism today, but this special feature would have been commissioned regardless if we were using page views, time spent on site, or some other metric.<p>One of these days, a new business model will come to dominate online media -- maybe even invented by one of the Y Combinator companies -- and I honestly hope it will encourage media outlets to return to an emphasis of quality over quantity. We're in the age of the page view right now, but it won't last forever.",1212121523

The nice aspect of requiring users to pony up some amount, which then becomes a pool that you make micro-payments from.  So you get the gating aspect of a for-pay service combined with the market forces resulting from the micropayments.

There's less money ""at risk"" if someone steals my credit card or skims my cc number (which has happened to me at a restaurant before - I paid with a credit card and the guy wrote down the number while handling my bill.

Freedom of speech is the kind of thing that comes up when a government agency puts warning labels on record albums, news media are prevented from reporting on government activities, or butthurt lawyers (<i>cough</i> <i>cough</i> Charles Carreon) try to use the courts to prevent people from criticizing their clients.<p>The blogger in question felt that the word ""badassity"" was an essential element of his brand, and that to change his header would dilute his brand in some way. He made a calculated decision that appeasing Chase would negatively affect his brand, perhaps even resulting in a reduction to his overall income in the long run, either directly or indirectly.  A post like this one reinforces his brand as a blog with ""integrity,"" and an attitude, and is sure to help offset whatever immediate loss he sees from Chase withdrawing their support.<p>While he's clearly a skilled and savvy blogger, I really don't see this as a free speech issue.

Without that secretary, how would your business function properly? It's these value judgements which really hurt us.<p>So, our society (which may or may not be structured around our competing cultures) has a mechanism for valuing these goods. We have the principles of economics - supply and demand. The things you mentioned are all objectively good to have. They're essential, even. But we've become very good at generating these goods. We've studied crops and health to maximize the good that these things provide, and we can now generate them with fairly little skill and effort. The reason that people who perform these ESSENTIAL tasks earn so little is that the supply of people ready and willing to do them is so great compared to the amount we need them to produce. If the supply of people who could perform these jobs decreased, or the demand for the goods they produce increased, the workers could demand higher wages.<p>I don't disagree that there are many factors that can and are used by ""the rich"" to keep ""the poor"" down, but I disagree that how society values these basic goods is really a significant source of this discrimination.",1340334981

C++ doesn't work differently when it's used by a black or female programmer. Same goes for programming perspectives in general. I don't design my classes differently because I grew up in the inner-city (nor would I need to tailor an answer for someone who did). I think your taking an argument usually reserved for social environments that are more dependent on interaction and group dynamics (e.g. a classroom) and trying to apply it to a more static engineering one. And while that study did find that increased diversity improved performance on ""business measures"", it did not find a causal link that specifically pointed to diversity as the reason, although I'm not sure it would have much bearing here anyway. Being creative in a broader business/social context is not the same as solving the type of specific engineering/programming questions generally found on SO.

Kids these days pick up computers and the Internet very quickly, while many older people (esp. 60+) struggle to understand it. I think this is largely just a property of the human brain - our capacity to learn new things decreases with age.<p>I was fortunate enough to have a father who did pretty much the same thing as this guy. Growing up in the 80s, I was introduced to the DOS command-line, BASIC, Turbo pascal, building and upgrading my own computers, etc. I distinctly remember the day when I was 8 years old and asked my father, with no prompting, ""Dad, how do you make programs?"". This was 24 years ago and pretty much every day since then I've been working with computers in some form or another, completing three CS degrees, teaching the subject at university, and starting my own software company. I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if it wasn't for my father.<p>As a CS lecturer I've seen some students who come into the first year courses having never written a line of code before in their lives, and others who were writing their own games all through high school. While there are some exceptions, the latter group tend to do far better at their studies and also often just naturally do their own projects outside of formal study, which IMHO is critical for learning the subject properly.<p>I think getting kids into the technical aspects of computers at an early age gives them a tremendous head start over their peers who are playing Xbox and angry birds on their iPad. This guy is giving his kids two of the most important gifts of all - education and inspiration, of the sort they'll never get in school.",1340334070

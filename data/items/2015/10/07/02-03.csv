They could find a market.<p>At the moment, Microsoft is kind of unique in having an OS that&#x27;s not tied to a walled garden app store by default, and which is centered around local desktop software (that usually doesn&#x27;t have a lot of spying built-in) designed to work with local data.

10343959,comment,10340527,10341709,0,0,meric,,,"Free money != Free wealth. Every time the government consumes a $1 of free money, $1 of resources (wood, metal, machines, labor) becomes unavailable to the private sector, reducing consumption & investment opportunities. Just because the government can access free money doesn&#x27;t mean the resources already there wouldn&#x27;t have been invested or consumed. By spending that $1 of free money (sub-optimally as governments apt to do), it increases government spending portion of the GDP, but reduces the private consumption and private investment part of the GDP, and by removing private investment, it removes GDP growth that could be manufactured by the private sector for $1, for theoretically, eternity. Borrowing money to spend now for consumption equates to bringing forward future consumption and future investment to be consumed right now, and for losing future growth you get extra consumption today, like eating your seed corn. And by removing private investment, the economy doesn&#x27;t grow, less labor is required to work the existing land & capital (due to technological progress), reducing % of the population in the labor force.<p>As the U.S. government <i>has been</i> spending the free money it is generating from bond sales, and as a consequence consuming and investing resources and capital in a sub-optimal manner, you see what&#x27;s exactly has been occurring, U.S. % of population in the labor force is dropping precipitously, corporations borrowing the free money for share buybacks instead of investing it (there are too few investment opportunities available because resources & capital is being soaked up by government spending). As a result the U.S. economy is anaemic enough the U.S. Fed isn&#x27;t confident enough to raise rates by a mere 0.25%, 7 years after the 2008 financial crisis.<p><i>“That’s why I often said that monetary policy was not a panacea — we needed Congress to do its part. After the crisis calmed, that help was not forthcoming. When the recovery predictably failed to lift all boats, the Fed often, I believe unfairly, took the criticism.”</i>  - Ben Bernanke<p><a href=""http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b1d44a48-6b71-11e5-8171-ba1968cf791a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b1d44a48-6b71-11e5-8171-ba196...</a>",1444186597

Basically, it has a ton of functionality for data analysis, it&#x27;s easy to use, reasonably efficient and reliable.

He said it would be &quot;a byword for impossible&quot; The thing about google is that, like Microsoft, it is a highly diversified company that does one thing and that is dangeroud. Peter Theil calls it a monopoly, maybe I would be a bit more delicate. Google and Microsoft have a ton of different products but each company really only sells 1 thing, a utility.<p>Microsoft was a BASIC interpreter for the Altair, and google was that for the web. For the reasons addressed in PG&#x27;s article <i>Microsoft is Dead</i>, it is evident that needs change but utilities usually don&#x27;t. If you read <i>What Microsoft Is this the Altair Basic of?</i> after this article, it is super short and basically says, the burden of proof is on you to not miss the next big idea.<p>So much crazy shit is happening now it is difficult to say what will kill google. This essay was in 07&#x27;, but it was too eary or too obvious, as he closes with. If 4 things killed google I would say they are:<p>hardware: Hardware is definitely important, and we can argue about how and what context, but google doesn&#x27;t build any. All their infrastructure, while massive, will be deprecated.<p>privacy:&quot;Don&#x27;t be evil&quot; is !== &quot;Be Good&quot;.<p>Advertising: Advertising is going to be A LOT less valuable, and the places it will be valuable have banned google.<p>Decentralized Tech: No idea what the interim search engines will look like but it will be __________ then Artificial Intelligence. I think it is private search, where you buy computational resources and algorithims from a network but supply the seed data for your preferences and retain them. Probably BTC/PGP will replace DNS and you will send or lease your own googlebot and people will sell distributed search algorithims. While Chrome and the v8 engine make a pretty good google bot, people don&#x27;t really trust google anymore which is why microsoft lost.

Some fancy computing goes into determining what to sell any given contract for, but that&#x27;s as far as it goes.  They&#x27;re traded by people who chat on the telephone, gather round the conference table, and then fax legalese back and forth.  These contracts are not traded on the sorts of highly liquid public exchanges that have HFT.  Nor is there much if any automated decision making in this corner of the financial industry.  No point in paying nerds a fortune to get instant decisions when implementing said decisions is going to take days or weeks (if it&#x27;s even possible).<p>Which is to say:  The 2008 financial crisis unfolded at human speeds.  The public liquid markets didn&#x27;t move any faster during the crisis than they in Herbert Hoover&#x27;s day.  (Investors already had telephones then.)  Public markets react to data as it becomes available, and all the relevant data at the time was generated by humans.<p>In particular, the central bank officials were forced to make quick decisions without complete information not &#x27;because HFT and yay automated trading&#x27;, but because there were a lot of well-informed and very scared humans telling them the economy was about to collapse.",1444183326

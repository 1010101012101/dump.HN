First of all your self-abasing statement that you could succeed <i>except</i> for DH2 is an obvious ploy to catch us off guard. Nice try.<p>Secondly, I don't like your tone. Not one bit, sir. Who, exactly are you to try arguing using all 7 categories? Oh, you're a hacker you say? Well, of <i>course</i> a hacker would think they could argue using all 7 categories!

But creating paper handouts as Tufte usually suggests would still probably be more effective, since your audience has something physical to take home.<p>I think a mind map presentation tool with <i>infinite</i> zoom and pan could be an interesting presentation tool.  Something like a high-resolution poster that you navigate in a presentation.  It could be distracting to the presenter though.",1207715090

Unfortunately, my partner was out of town during most of the development of our demo, and I'm not very satisfied with what I had together come submission time.  What I'm happy about is that I feel the work making the demo was a growth experience.  (An entertaining one, as a bonus!)<p>Of course, we're still going to work on it, regardless of whether or not we get accepted.  I'm going to start actively using it for its intended purpose within a week, which should be really informative.<p>Also, good luck with your businesses, to everyone who applied!

We have already given up building the site and were ready to let the idea wait for another year, but then our co-prankster, who didn't read the e-mails where we communicated our decision to postpone, called us on the phone and said the press-release was already on its way to tech publications all around. Then I had about one hour to write all the text you see in the cover, a couple news items excepted, while my other co-prankster was buying the domain, setting up hosting and uploading the HTML skeleton and designing the logo. I was sitting in a café waiting to pick up my wife while I banged this page.<p>From that OMFG moment, the denial-anger cycle that followed, to uploading the last touches, we made it all in about three hours.<p>We will plan better for next April.

The User's Manual (<a href=""http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual....</a>) is quite readable and covers most common and many uncommon use cases. I've also never had trouble making sense of the man pages for the individual commands. They are dense, but they cover a whole slew of highly advanced functionality and have always seemed to me quite thorough.<p>Also, I'm not sure I agree git has a particularly steep learning curve. I know that in the pre-1.5 days, everyday usage required a lot more knowledge of the plumbing, but today, the high-level commands seem pretty straightforward to me. Sure, the index takes some getting used to (and a very nice tool it turns out to be, too), but is that really the only thing that makes you say that git has a steep learning curve?",1207713952

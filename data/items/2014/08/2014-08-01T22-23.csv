First, it&#x27;s not zero-sum since computer control results in more safety overall. The computer has more information available (e.g. sensor readings on all sides) and can react much faster (eliminating the ~1.5 s typical reaction time [1]). The driver and the kid in the road will both survive more often this way.<p>Second, drivers can be pretty selfish. E.g. everyday behaviors like cutting people off or running red lights offer little benefit for the cost of endangering everyone on the road. How many would simply set it to &quot;always drive over the kid in the tunnel&quot;?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/STHF0203_1#.U9wU2fldXzg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/STHF0203_1#.U9wU2...</a>",1406933351

Is this actually desirable?<p>I&#x27;d call it the ability to care for oneself independently, generally meaning the ability to hold a job and manage personal affairs. Asperger&#x27;s and full-blown autism are very different things. This is like comparing a common cold with a life-threatening case of pneumonia.<p>I worked with autistic people for six years. In the best cases, they weren&#x27;t able to care for themselves, but they had few enough behavioral problems that they could go on brief &#x27;outings&#x27; in the community with staff never more than a few feet away. In the worst cases, they were violent, engaging in serious self-harm, as well as attacking others. I had to take assault response training and use it on a regular basis. They spent little or no time with their families, had no friends, and usually hated the other clients in their group home. It was not a good life, despite the best efforts of the staff.<p>tl;dr: yes, in my experience, beating autism is <i>highly</i> desirable.",1406932805

Otherwise, someone will be unhappy and most probably this one will be a child that has no way to express the immensity of its distress. When we got the diagnosis for our son, first night, we were sitting with my wife outside, while he was sleeping. She told me &quot;I do not want to force him to be something he is not. I do not want him to be a robot.&quot; And we decided to try to instead understand how it is to be him and find the best and most normal communication channel in his world. In the process, I think we all developed and we are extremely lucky to now read this article and know that he is very close to be one of these few cases that are &quot;cured&quot;.\nI will just leave this here, in case someone is going through the same situation. You will find a million different treatments and theories. Always be present at the treatment and see how it makes you feel. If you feel alright, keep on. If something is feeling wrong leave. Do not overload the child with specialist time, especially as he/she progresses the time the child wants is with you. Work with the child like if you push one of those super market trolleys with one wheel stuck, you have to move and bend your own body. Finally, try to introduce the child to unexpectedness and randomness. Do it gently. Flip a coin (randomness), hide the coin in your palm and let him choose which palm it is in (unexpectedness of someone else&#x27;s decisions), play rock-paper-scissors. Don&#x27;t do it all at once.

So from a geopolitical point of view stirring this up was a fairly dumb mistake, the EU (and Obama) figured they could slip this one by but Putin found a way to foment unrest in the Ukraine at the expense of lots of lives.<p>Stability: good, global silly chess games: bad.<p>Putin will hang himself and his buddies too given enough rope and enough time. Yank his chain and he&#x27;ll react, and he&#x27;ll gain local popularity because of the general publics non-interest in world affairs. So in my not so humble opinion this is all just dumb war mongering and a potential set-back for 30 years or so of slowly improving relations and it will likely take decades again to recover the lost ground <i>if</i> we don&#x27;t get a nice little war in the Ukraine, Crimea and Moldova region before then.<p>Which would lead to a bunch more nationalism in Russia, potentially a new cold war and a whole lot of lives lost besides.<p>That region is a <i>very</i> bad hotspot and to start moving chess pieces around there is about as stupid as encouraging Taiwan to finally really break off from the Chinese, Backing either Pakistan or India against the other or by sending arms and money to Tibet.<p>I&#x27;m sure my elected leaders think they know what they&#x27;re doing but I fear they are simply not capable of thinking ahead far enough when it comes to consequences of actions.<p>And that includes your elected leaders as well.<p>I&#x27;m fully going on the assumption here that the lines of command reach all the way back to Russia, and I&#x27;m also very sure that they <i>never ever</i> thought they were downing a passenger jet. The fall-out from this will have extremely serious consequences (as it should) but I fear that a lot more lives could be lost if this situation is not handled properly. I know people all over the world and Ukraine is not an exception. My friend Dima (Dmitry) there lives in one part of the country and has family in the other. Another friend of mine is married to a lady from there. This is a lot closer to home for me than it probably is for you and it bugs me that people here pretend that the Ukraine is far away and that this will not affect &#x27;us&#x27;.<p>Of course it will affect us, and the response so far has been just this side of dumb. The EU structurally underestimates the still very formidable military might of the former USSR, is living with a wounded bear on its doorstep and has now kicked this bear in the proverbial testicles.<p>Lots of people have already died as a consequence (including those in that plane) and it starts to become harder and harder to see a path to de-escalation.<p>Putins end-game (if I&#x27;m any judge of affairs like these, which I&#x27;m probably not) is that he&#x27;ll &#x27;keep the peace&#x27; because Europe can&#x27;t afford it, which will result in permanent Russian army presence in fairly large numbers in the eastern part of the country, which will be a military backed re-affirmation of the former status quo.<p>And then Europe will have to back away from their plans of annexing the Ukraine, which they likely will do but not easily (they can&#x27;t for political / image reasons).<p>This will still have all kinds of risks but it will at least extinguish the fuse. As long as the Russians are playing proxy there is still a way out of this, as soon as the gloves come off and they roll a few divisions into the Ukraine all hope of resolving the situation without an all-out confrontation with Russia will be lost. I <i>highly</i> doubt Europe and the US are both capable and have the political stamina to pull off such a confrontation.<p>Kids playing with fire.",1406930629

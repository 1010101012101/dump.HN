8782664,comment,8780675,8782567,0,0,Jongseong,,,"From the other side, Norse accounts describe often hostile encounters with natives, whom they called Skrælings. This term referred to the Greenland Inuits and the (probably Algonquian-speaking) Canadian Indians in Vinland. Intriguingly, some accounts might possibly also describe encounters with the Dorset people, who still maintained some presence in Northwestern Greenland for a few centuries after the Norse settled in Greenland. Of course, the Inuit also have oral traditions about the now-extinct Dorset people.<p>I don&#x27;t know of any oral traditions about the Norse from Canadian Indians, though. Unlike the settlements in Greenland, L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows was just an exploration base that never developed into a permanent settlement. So unlike the prolonged periods of contact between the Norse and the Inuit, there might have been just a few isolated encounters between the Norse and the Canadian Indians that didn&#x27;t leave enough of an impression to be preserved in oral tradition.",1419245657

I&#x27;m not sure how that changes things for first-time VAT registered businesses. For businesses that have not been registered for 12 months or more (i.e. everyone who is applying for the first time), they can still apply but HMRC will advise the amount of the instalments to be paid (monthly by default, quarterly also available) which are usually supposed to be estimated based on the last year&#x27;s liability. I&#x27;d be curious to see how HMRC will react to getting applications for the VAT Annual Accounting Scheme from all the first-time VAT registrants with very little to base their VAT estimates on, but that wouldn&#x27;t happen unless all these self-employed people had any idea that the scheme existed.",1419243772

8782602,comment,8782580,8782580,0,0,onion2k,,,"The idea of paying someone to contribute a week of their time to an open source project is commendable, but a couple of issues spring to mind;<p>1. The problem with any &quot;pay someone to do some test work&quot; solution to hiring ignores the fact that most people already have a job. They will need to either take time off to do the test, which is effectively asking someone to give up vacation time to speculatively spend time working for a new job, or for them to do the test work outside of hours and be consequentially less effective in both the test and their existing job. Neither option is reasonable. There might also be contractual obligations with their current role that prohibit them working on paid outside development.<p>2. Having someone contributing to an open source project for a week and then vanishing means lots of open projects would get tiny bits of unmaintained code pushed to them making the maintainers lives harder. That&#x27;s fine if it&#x27;s a trivial big fix, but if you wanted to test someone&#x27;s ability to add a feature to a project you&#x27;re essentially asking the project maintainers to take on a feature that won&#x27;t be supported afterwards. Again, that&#x27;s not reasonable. This could be mitigated by giving the employee time to carry on supporting the feature once they&#x27;re hired, or for an existing employee to maintain code that&#x27;s added if the hire is rejected.<p>I like the idea, but really, why not just make it known that your company prefers to hire people with an existing profile in an open source project? That would encourage people to contribute in the long term rather than just popping in for a week.",1419243138

8782598,comment,8781522,8781907,0,0,simias,,,"I guess it depends where you come from, coming from C Rust feels very elegant. I miss Option a lot when I go back to writing C, for instance.<p>Maybe if you write your code first and then modify it to get through the borrow checker it just means you&#x27;re not yet familiar enough with the language&#x27;s pattern (and given how young and unstable it is at the moment, I doubt anybody can pretend to know idiomatic rust at that point). Maybe if you took ownership constraints while designing your application you would end up with more elegant code? It definitely adds a cognitive load though, that&#x27;s for sure.<p>As for the &quot;match&quot;, &quot;is_ok&quot; and &quot;unwrap&quot; noise, it used to be a problem in my code as well but since refutable lets have been added to the language it&#x27;s not really a problem anymore. For instance in my code I used to have:<p><pre><code>    match map::in_range(addr, map::ZERO_PAGE) {\n        Some(off) => {\n            // Do stuff with off\n        }\n        _        => (),\n    }\n</code></pre>\nOr:<p><pre><code>    let off = map::in_range(addr, map::ZERO_PAGE);\n\n    if off.is_some() {\n        let off = off.unwrap();\n        // Do stuff with off\n    }\n</code></pre>\nNone of which is elegant or nice looking. With refutable lets I can write that:<p><pre><code>    if let Some(off) = map::in_range(addr, map::ZERO_PAGE) {\n        // Do stuff with off\n    }\n</code></pre>\nFor is_ok I use the try! macro which is admittedly a bit hackish but works well in practice. In the end I never use unwrap()/is_ok() outside of test code where I don&#x27;t want to do proper error handling and let the runtime panic if something goes wrong.",1419242960

To me, the thing that was revolutionary with pull services is that, for the first time ever, you could tailor ads to your users.<p>Push is just a throwback to the era of magazines: there&#x27;s probably value in ads seen by millions, but only for some massive brands.<p>All of this make me think that the push services are going to bring much smaller revenue than pull services, so calling them the next era of the internet is a bit optimistic.",1419242871

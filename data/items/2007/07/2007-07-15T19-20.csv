34354,comment,34328,34328,0,0,spiralhead,,,"I agree with the ""productivity comes in spurts"" sentiment. I typically have about 2-4 hours of real productive brain chemistry per day--where my mind is conducive to creating something, or solving something. This usually comes in the morning for me. The rest of the day, I spend reading/exchanging info with other people--which all ends up getting assimilated into my work somehow, after a good sleep.

It's not unusual when I spend 6 h. on a 2 h. programming task only because I can't get into the flow, and then I finish a 4 h task in one.<p>Ah, I really need to startup ;)",1184529051

34351,comment,34260,34335,0,0,deramisan,,,"I have already conceded that the article could have cited better sources, but my point remains: you could have as well. You implied that the article author did not know as much as you did. You suggested that they were not only not citing sources that didn't help the argument but also making factually inaccurate claims.<p>In so doing, you took an implicit position of authority on the matter by claiming (as a user with insider knowledge) that the author was wrong. That was wrong, which makes you equally (or more so) guilty of unsound reasoning and misleading or misguided argument. If you claim to know better and are wrong, doesn't that make your statements even more misguided than someone who raises 'concerns' about an issue and says it quote ""sounds like Gmail' and turns about to be justified in these concerns?<p>The article clearly raises the entire question as a 'concern' as stated in the headline. Your statements were much closer to being assertions of fact based on expert opinion. Could the article have cited better sources? Yes. Does that mean the article author didn't know what he was talking about? No, and the article turned out to be correct. Could you have cited better sources yourself? Yes. Did it turn out that the article was right and you were wrong? Also yes.<p>You tell me. Seriously. You tell me: what is worse: (1) failing to site the right source but writing truthful content, or (2) implicitly claiming expert status and writing false content defaming an accurate source.",1184527179

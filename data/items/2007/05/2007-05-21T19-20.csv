Don't go higher and don't be afraid to walk away.  Find options to the name you really want.  Options are leverage.  Most squatters want a quick buck.  If you offer more than they've paid for it and don't seem desperate you stand a good chance of picking it up for an ok price.",1179777022

Granted one needs to know C/C++ and not Java.  <p>If whatever operation you need is not already implemented by a Python module you can just write those 100 lines of fast C++ code and then call it from Python.<p>As far as knowing what's going on in general you can always look at the Python source code.",1179776672

Throwing in a few convenience functions to make the common case simple would not detract from the ""flexibility"" one bit. It shows that they gave zero thought to what people will actually do with the library.<p>BTW, want to take a stab at writing the ""save at different quality level"" code? (since you don't mind writing lots of code) You can post your solution here.",1179776433

23684,comment,23601,23601,0,0,Tichy,,,"I definitely have the impression that many Java developers just love to play around - they program for the sake of programming, not for the sake of getting things done.<p>That said I am not sure the imaging API is as bad as Paul makes it. My guess is that the jpg-api of Python is more like the ""escapeMYSQL""-method in PHP. The Java API is very general, so that you can plug in different codecs and encode the image in whatever way you want (JPG, TIFF, GIF, whatever). Can Python do the same?<p>On the other hand, only JPG matters for Web development, so the generalised API might not be much of an advantage.",1179775833

23681,comment,23649,23649,0,0,kyro,,,"What Facebook did was smart. They initially marketed it to the 'older' and 'more mature' group, meaning those who just entered college and older. They made us feel as if Facebook was a way of establishing ourselves in a new and more sophisticated community, a 'community where we weren't pestered by annoying high schoolers like on Myspace.'<p>Then when the time was right, they opened it to all.

93699,comment,93647,93685,0,0,aswanson,,,"Great question, and there is always a fair amount of debate in this area.  A way to start thinking about it is to ask how many logical states you need to store.  If it exceeds a trivial amount you are almost always better off using one.  I can't give you a more accurate answer without knowing more about what you are trying to do.",1199044727

93697,comment,93683,93686,0,0,carpal,,,"Are those valid zip codes?  Neither 77915 or 12345 are in my database of zip codes.  <p>I have a table that has the lat/long of zip codes so that I can find the closest observation station.<p>Edit: If I can't find the zip, I'll default to that state's center.  So even invalid zip codes like 12345 will ""work""- in this case, it'll go to around Schenectady.",1199044532

93695,comment,93683,93683,0,0,rrival,,,"Feature requests: ip to location or save zip in a cookie that's easy to change. The most annoying part of weather.com for me, aside from the clutter, is typing in a zip. Having the forecast oriented horizontally like a calendar would be nice. ical integration would be pretty slick.",1199043982
93694,comment,93654,93654,0,0,simpleenigma,,,"I personally believe that this is where the data you collect about a persons voting should be used to recommend articles for them specifically. Then you can go to the main page to see what the community votes up, or you can go to a personalized page that is designed for you based on your voting and what other similar users vote for.<p>Its a mix between democracy and personalization and it allows for the users who really do want to be the lowest common denominator.",1199043669

93692,comment,93654,93657,0,0,waleedka,,,"Interesting. I reached the same conclusion. I start by inviting trusted friends and friends of friends to sign up to the community before it's open to the public, and use their voting data as a base to measure against. And, of course, continued tweaking is also required. It's not 100% democratic because a selected few set the tone of the community, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Seems to work great in news.yc.",1199043085

93689,comment,93216,93281,0,0,edgeztv,,,"There are so many things wrong with your example!  You basically wrote the ugliest Java code you could possibly think of for this simple program.<p>First, in order to get an objective comparison of code length you should at least use the same (length) variable names.  You used ""lineTokenizer"" in your Java example and ""l"" in your Ruby example!<p>Second, you could have just written System.out.println(sum) in Java.  The fact that you had to write System.out.println(Integer.toString(sum)) shows your lack of basic Java knowledge.<p>Lastly, the brackets around your one-line while loop in Java are unnecessary, unlike the brackets around your closure in Ruby.<p>Also, the Java main method declaration is irrelevant to your point, since it's written only once per program, and is automatically created by any IDE.<p>How about this equivalent Java code to match your Ruby example:<p><pre><code>  int count = 0;\n  Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);\n  while (s.hasNextInt())\n    count += s.nextInt();\n  System.out.println(count);\n</code></pre>\nNot so different now, is it?  You can write concise code in any language if you know how to use it.",1199042327
93688,comment,93537,93610,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"> a strange element of anti-intellectualism in America<p>There is a healthy distrust of elites claiming authority on the basis of intellect and education.  ""We are in charge because we're smarter than you and know how to take care of you"" really does fly in a lot of other countries.  Call it ""Mandarinism""; its hallmark is examinations and elite institutions.  In America, opposition to this sort of thing goes back to the defeat of the Hamiltonians.<p>As for a general disdain for intellectual pursuits in the culture at large, that's just a bunch of bullshit.  It's no different from any other country once you take demographics into account.",1199042012

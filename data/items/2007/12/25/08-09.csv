I'm actually pretty devout in my Christianity, but I rather dislike people who are jerks about it.  How about this:  <p>To my Christian friends Merry Christmas.\nTo my Jewish friends Happy Hannukah.\nTo my Atheist friends Happy Holidays.\nAnd to all a happy New Year. \n(Unless you're Chinese, then I'm a few weeks early.)",1198572952

I really don't want to keep a 6 billion row spreadsheet of holiday associations for everyone I might encounter and wish well of.<p>Will mass confusion ensue if generic ""happy holidays"" cards are sent on the same day as christmas? Will people not know what day of the year it is? There is no utility to the nomenclature. No religion owns the day, and it's hardly a religious holiday to begin with.<p>It doesn't offend me when people say merry christmas, it only offends me if they are attempting to correct somebody who says happy holidays. It's a superset. You're correcting someone who says ""yes! it's the weekend!"" with ""no, but thank god it's Saturday!"".",1198569733

Moreover, such code submissions would compete with each other, with more effective ones rising in popularity in their respective domains.<p>Unlike APIs that are currently available, the submissions made by users here would make up the core feature set of the service.",1172602086

A good word for your product will reach millions in a very short time span. <p>But I disagree with you about web ads. Web ads will continue to be viable and valuable. There is plenty of proof online regarding the type of conversion returns that firms are getting and the revenue publishers are generating. If someone wrote television ads off, saying that the majority of people just change the channel, they&#39;d be dead wrong.<p>A lot of people tune out ads online. Many, many don&#39;t -- especially today when they have become more relevant to your desires than ever.",1172601385

1402,comment,1373,1381,0,0,amichail,,,"I think it would be interesting to provide a way to give people advice in real-time via the web. For example, you might watch a sports game on the web and give advice to individual players about what they might do next in real-time. So the spectators replace the coaches here.",1172600711
1401,comment,1373,1373,0,0,amichail,,,"I really like the photosynth idea: http://labs.live.com/photosynth.\nBut can we take this idea further? For example, what can we do with video? Maybe we could put together many people&#39;s videos to produce a dynamic 3d world? One could imagine allowing people to watch and explore events in 3d such as concerts and sports games.<p>Another idea is to identify dense areas in 3d where people tend to take a lot of photographs. One could then use these dense areas to guide people to interesting places. For example, when visiting a museum, one might look at the dense areas first.",1172600498

For example, one can create an online dating service where people bet on whom they believe would make good couples. People might then take this as a suggestion as to whom to consider for a date. A similar thing can be done with business relationships, academic collaborations, etc.",1172600262

All you can really do is start calling up professors in your rolodex, but it&#39;s hard when it&#39;s something that is somewhere in between three or four different fields, but not really a part of any of them.",1172599435

And my philosophy is that you should treat people the way they treat others.<p>Btw, I went to the first MA tech events at his house, and he was great then. However, as he got notoriety and became public figure he started lecturing industries over and over, became very aggressive, often disrespectful, and sometime extremely violent. When it was about the blogging and PR industries, I did not have enough context to answer, but as his post targeted my backyard which is the entrepreneur and tech community, I took it to heart to respond an harsh but respectful open letter.<p>So, yes, it was harsh and blunt and directed at Michael Arrington, but  I do not think this post was was rude, disrespectful, or say anything wrong about him.<p>2) Tech thriving arguments: Ok, apparently we agree on the where, but not the why. My point was that now, since technology has been fully popularized from an interface (e.g, touch) and distribution (e.g. app stores in addition to web), the opportunities are endless. Back in the days, we always had to worry if the user was tech savvy enough to use or install the product, and how to get the product to the users. Over the last few years, this has been virtually illuminated, for consumer and for enterprise users. Touch interface are so natural that virtually anybody can use a computing device nowadays. For me, and the impact that this can have on how further we can absorb computing in our all aspect of our life is just mind blowing. If you add the popularization of 3D printing, which will bring the digital world to the real one, this is even more mind blowing. Anyway, those are really my points, but if you think I missed the bigger picture, let me know, I am genuinely curious.<p>3) On Michael Arrington giving opinions: I love opinions, I am opinionated, and I also love to be proven wrong, as I learn when I am wrong and dont when I am right. So, I have nothing about someone giving opinions, I am against people blaming a industry or community about being slow, un-innovative, or unethical, especially when you have a huge voice (which Michael Arrington definitely earned). And this is what Michael Arrington has been doing over and over for the last 5 to 7 years.<p>We, the older crowd have a responsibility to enable our younger siblings to thrive where we have not, and for this blaming and lecturing ourselves can only be divert people to the wrong direction.<p>Now, obviously, freedom of speech first and foremost, Michael Arrington had the right to wrote what he wrote, I had the right to disagree with him and his style,  and people has the right to disagree with one or the other or both.<p>Best, thanks for this good points.

4998432,comment,4998185,4998206,3,0,pitt1980,,,"want to guesstimate how many people on the Forbes 30 for 30 list had private college paid for by their upper middle class (if not better parents)?<p>I think it makes sense to think seriously about the restrictions taking on education debt will place on your life in the future, and to think seriously about if that's the best use for the resources it takes to go to college<p>different viewpoint on ROI calculations:<p>The average tuition cost is approximately $16,000 per year. Plus assume another $10,000 in living costs, books, etc. $26,000 in total for a complete cost of $104,000 in a 4 year period. Some people choose to go more expensive by going to a private college and some people choose to go a little cheaper by going public but this is an average. Also, a huge assumption is that its just for a 4 year period. According to the Department of Education, only 54% of undergraduates graduate within 6 years. So for the 46% that dont graduate, or take 10 years to graduate, this is a horrible investment. But lets assume your children are in the brilliant first half who finish within six years (and hopefully within four). Is it worth it? First, lets look at it completely from a monetary perspective. Over the course of a lifetime, according to CollegeBoard, a college graduate can be expected to earn $800,000 more than his counterpart that didnt go to college. $800,000 is a big spread and it could potentially separate the haves from the have-nots. But who has and who doesnt? If I took that $104,000 and I chose to invest it in a savings account that had interest income of 5% per year Id end up with an extra $1.4 million dollars over a 50 year period. A full $600,000 more. That $600,000 is a lot of extra money an 18 year old could look forward to in her retirement. I also think the $800,000 quoted above is too high. Right now most motivated kids who have the interest and resources to go to college think its the only way to go if they want a good job. If those same kids decided to not go to college my guess is they would quickly close the gap on that $800,000 spread. There are other factors as well. I wont be spending $104,000 per child when my children, ages 10 and 7, decide to go to college. College costs have historically gone up much faster than inflation. Since 1978, cost of living has gone up three-fold. Medical costs, much to the horror of everyone in Congress, has gone up six-fold. And college education has gone up a whopping tenfold. This is beyond the housing bubble, the stock market bubble, any bubble you can think of. So how can people afford college? Well, how has the US consumer afforded anything? They borrow it, of course. The average student now graduates with a $23,000 debt burden. Up from $13,000 12 years ago. Last year, student borrowings totaled $75 billion, up 25% from the year before. If students go on to graduate degrees such as law degrees they can see their debt burden soar to $200,000 or more. And the easy borrowing convinces colleges that they can raise prices even more. <a href=""http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2010/02/dont-send-your-kids-to-..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2010/02/dont-send-your-kids-to-...</a>. <a href=""http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/01/10-more-reasons-why-par..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/01/10-more-reasons-why-par...</a>. <a href=""http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/01/8-alternatives-to-colle..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/01/8-alternatives-to-colle...</a>.",1357152683

4998373,comment,4996914,4996914,8,0,chernevik,,,"Very interesting.  But the focus on New York probably skews the analysis a lot, particularly in early years when rivers and canals would have been important routes.  Notice the bend of the 1800 curves up the eastern NY border, and into southeastern Pennsylvania?  I bet those reflect the use of the Hudson and Delaware rivers for travel, and possibly linkage to other rivers like the Ohio, Susquehanna and Potomac.  Likewise I suspect that in 1830 Chicago was probably closer to New Orleans, on the Mississippi, than it was to New York.<p>Likewise the transport of goods, rather than passengers, was probably more important in forming perceptions of distance, as that's what would drive commerce and thus ongoing relationships.<p>Attention to goods and other point pairings probably matter a lot when you get to 1857.  I expect internal communications, of goods, in the South reflected high proximity to the nearest port, and that NY was essentially on the other side of the moon.  Whereas the North was probably much more homogenous in its travel times (proportionately more railroad, less river) -- but largely isolated from the South.  Which would have done a lot to foster disunion among the two geographies.<p>That view would probably also say a lot about the border states, I bet that would show these were essentially islands unto themselves.",1357152309

I had an Audi A3 breakdown in SF on the way to Startup School, I told them I had an appointment. They instantly called me a cab, booked me a new Audi A3 in the FiDi and refunded my entire reservation + $75 in driving credit. Also, since I was under 21 at the time, they had to change the reservation to my passengers account since I couldn't rent cars outside UC. He also was not charged for the reservation and got $25 in credit.<p>The cars are always clean and I have never had a low fuel situation. Now, I rent cars in the Downtown Oakland area so I can't say the same for SF but thats just me. Oakland/Berkeley does have the weekend availability problem but if I know I am going somewhere on the weekend I can book as late as Friday night and still get a car I want.<p>The cost. I pay as low as $7 an hour for a Mazda 3, $9 an hour for an Audi A3, Mini, VW Golf. I have a small discount via FoundersCard however. Still though, those prices are pretty great to rent a car, especially since Zipcar covers gas, maintenance and insurance.<p>Insurance. If you do not have a waiver, you pay the first $750 of an accident, Zipcar pays the rest. If you have a waiver ($10 a month), you do not pay anything. Also, it counts as real car insurance so when you do buy a car and need auto insurance, you can say you have had continuing coverage. <a href=""http://www.zipcar.com/how/faqs/what-damage-fee"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zipcar.com/how/faqs/what-damage-fee</a>",1357150738

The new ones have to distort things to align to the grid, and wind up looking inconsistent and unbalanced.<p>I'm comparing the new icons with my downloaded version of 2.0, and, for example, the ""i"" in the ""info"" icon is no longer centered. Or, now icons like ""asterisk"" or ""ban-circle"" have strokes that are too thick, while ""envelope"" is too skinny -- since strokes basically have to be 1px or 2px, I guess.<p>Previously, the icons were drawn in a balanced and consistent way, and all looked good together. Now, their widths and shapes have been shoehorned into a 14px grid that frankly destroys a lot of their charm and consistency.<p>Pixel-fitting made perfect sense when fonts weren't anti-aliased, but now that almost everyone has even subpixel hinting enabled, it's anachronistic. The FontAwesome team has done a great job with introducing <i>new</i> icons, but it saddens me to see what were once beautifully proportioned icons that showed excellent design taste, now take a giant step <i>backwards</i>.<p>In a strange way, it reminds me of when IKEA stopped using Futura and started using Verdana a couple years ago.

For example, as an effect of this prioritization, iOS doesn't report scroll position while you're scrolling a page or scrollable div in a page, until the scroll has completed, and the scroll momentum has come to a full stop. This makes all sorts of app-like interactions impossible in an iOS webapp.<p>I don't really think that the user experience is poor, per se. I think it's a matter of acclimation; I've been using Android since the Nexus One, and while it was certainly frustrating in the past, Android 4.1 really stepped things up, and it's a really nice experience now. I appreciate how iOS scrolling feels, but in general, Android's way of doing things seems to be a lot nicer to me. I actively use Android and iOS devices on a daily basis (my phone is an LG Nexus 4, the same one you disliked), and Android feels much, much better to me than iOS does, with the sole exception of scrolling smoothness.<p>It's worth noting that there is one difference that might have been annoying you; iOS starts scrolling as soon as you start moving your finger. Android has a deadzone of a few pixels, so it might feel less responsive if you're used to the lack of deadzone on iOS. Once you're used to it, it's not an issue.",1357150034

4998054,comment,4997724,4997724,11,0,diego_moita,,,"The problem with any book list like this is the scope. Software is turning into a very diverse culture, a very heterogeneous ecosystem. Subjects that are very important to one area might not be as important to other areas. Design patterns are essential for enterprise development, not so much for AI and low level systems programming. Algorithms are essential for the latest but not for the former.<p>Given this, there are some books you might add or remove depending on the area you are interested (e.g.: Knuth's ""Art of Computer Programming"", Martin Fowler's ""Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture"", ...)<p>To finish, 2 books people recommend a lot for beginning programmers:<p>""The Pragmatic Programmer""- Hunt, Thomas: a very good book, with sound advice and very easy to read. The only bad side is that it became so influential that its ideas became vulgarized in thousands of blogs.<p>""Code Complete"" - Steve McConnel : A very dangerous book. It does give have a lot of sound advice. But, IMO, it has some big problems. First is that it gives the false impression that there is a lot of empirical evidence on what works on software engineering. Second, it perpetuates some myths that don't have such evidence: the ""orders of magnitude programmer's productivity"" and ""the cone of uncertainty"" (see: <a href=""https://leanpub.com/leprechauns"" rel=""nofollow"">https://leanpub.com/leprechauns</a>).",1357149745

She has not used the internet once on it, but we installed a few apps to make it easier for her to use (e.g. one app puts a picture of the last person who called on the home screen).  We also set it up to dial out through Google Voice (total integration is best on Android, including replacing the dialer).  I bet a large portion of Android users fall into this category.",1357149738

If he had reason to not trust them, then he should share his reasoning. It would help us to understand why he was conducting a post-installation scan in the first place. It is not normal behavior otherwise.<p>> Eh, not really. We just need to run the same scans (using lots of different software) on other Samsung laptops, both the same and different models, and see if it detects the logger.<p>Very true.

Are there smaller/larger amounts?<p>2. Getting votes and endorsements: They want startups to get votes from general people to improve their chances of getting selected. This is a bad idea. <i>It is crowd-sourcing herd mentality.</i> I think that is a waste of time for the startup. I saw a post (<a href=""http://www.masschallenge.org/blog/how-make-it-masschallenge-..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.masschallenge.org/blog/how-make-it-masschallenge-...</a>) about the things a company did to get those points and I would rather spend that time on the business.

I would love to spend a few days really digging to build an RSS feed of specific blogs tailored to my interests but I'm still not really sure where to start.<p>I have got a few specific topics I'm looking for.  One is on intelligent underground hip hop.  I'm talking about people who aren't signed, haven't released an album, but have a few mp3s up on the internet.  I'm always digging through the internet to find and meet these artists but I can not find a reliable blog that does this.  If I can't find one I will make one, but I would be shocked if nobody is doing this.<p>I would also be interested in other blogs about discovering books and movies.  The more I think about it I'm interested in people who are ""culture diggers,"" focused on finding and sharing hidden gems rather than commenting on already popular culture.<p>The real question of mine is not whether you can point me to some relevant blogs (if you can I'll still take them, haha!) but rather how should I go about searching for such specific blog topics.  I've found a few blog aggregation sites but they're usually sorted by depressingly irrelevant metrics.

You should register (with $199), and if you are serious about your plans you'll have many, many opportunities to get your full $199 back from MassChallenge. They make it easy to get reimbursed (e.g. give an informal pitch in one of the early pitch practice sessions, etc.). Last year we got our registration fee back very quickly (we could have gotten back even several times that).

And, basically any place across the river into IL is pretty nasty and full of hookers and crack.  You have to drive a long way to get to civilization like the suburbs of Chicago.  So, if I had to throw a guess out there about some random numbers that a dead guy was writing, I'm going to go with drug related in some way.  Addresses, measurements, dollar amounts, something like that  And, none of the numbers have any relationship to highways or streets in the area.  But, there's a house with the address of 194 Orchard Drive and it happens to be located near highway 367 in between Alton and St. Louis, which is the only description of the location of the body that I've been able to find.  Also, the house was sold in early 2000, six months after the body was found.  It's all grasping at straws because, let's face it, random ciphers don't get you anything.  You have to know more about the person than the FBI has said.  It would help if they told us whether he was a known drug user, pimp, gang banger, or even an avid churchgoer, anything would be better than what they've done which is, ""Here's this random string of letters and numbers with no context.

With this inflation, the weight of an individual vote lessens dramatically and it becomes especially evident in the article submission mechanism where there are no downvotes at all.<p>Encountering a user with less than a thousand karma points today is exceptionally rare. That's why 20 points feel so arbitrary. The more I think about this, the more I believe the karma system itself is vulnerable to issues scale. There are a number of ways to ""fix"" this, but I don't think any of them will actually be implemented here because they would change the nature of the community too much.",1301507066

The rate of increase of the USD M0 money supply is around 4.50% (I am having trouble finding the exact value).<p>2. money supply alone does not determine the true value of a currency - the size of the economy (amount of goods and services purchasable with that currency) is also a factor, among other things.<p>It seems to me a reasonable assumption that, given how green BTC is (created in 2009), the size of the BTC economy is increasing substantially faster than the size of the USD. If this is the case, BTC's increasing market size is probably greater than its increasing money supply, relative to the USD - quite possibly enough to justify its increase in value, by my estimates.<p>EDIT: the Bitcoin M0 increase rate is currently 50%, not 7.57% - this is an important difference, and it supports your statement that the value of Bitcoins is quite speculative. However, I stand by my reasoning that it is less speculative than you claim.",1301507039

Just as it's perfectly reasonable for company A to make a product that user B finds repellant, it's also perfectly reasonable for a company to make a Mac product that sucks, and it's equally reasonable for a Mac user to avoid it at all costs.

Replicating the PC experience with your Mac product works if you have all these PC users at the office and one day IT removes their PCs and replaces them with Macs. Or if you have a company with Macs and PCs and IT support costs show up in a report somewhere, but Mac user frustration with a poor interface is ""off balance-sheet.""<p>But if someone owns a PC and decides to <i>switch</i> to a Mac, it's because he explicitly doesn't like the PC experience.

Because of the readability: (Taken from the article)<p><pre><code>    (let [width (inc (apply max (map (comp count values) squares)))
          line (join \+ (repeat 3 (join (repeat (* 3 width) \-))))] 
</code></pre>
So, I see that and I'm like, wtf, where do I start.<p>let width .. inc apply max of map comp coun, wtf. Let's start from the end. 
map all squares with comp count values, take the max of those, increment it, put that in width. ok<p>then, line join repeat 3 join.. wtf. let's try it from the end;
minus three times the width repeat.. ok, repeat 3<i>width '-', then, join this, repeat it 3 times, then join again with +, and put that in line.<p>I always struggle like that when reading lisp, people always give example like:<p>(map square '(1 2 3 4)) where you can read it all in one pass.. but real code is usually more complicated. So, if I had to rewrite that more clearly, I'd probably just separate it in more functions so I don't have to have more than, say 4 nested ().<p>And, yeah, the problem is not that much the ""read from the end"", but more about the actual work of each line of lisp being a puzzle to guess where to start reading it. Some are better to read up front, others are better to start from the last. Sometime you skip the first part, and read the last part, then come back at the beginning. That is what trouble me. I want to be able to read code as fast as possible - skim over it while understanding it.<p>Now, you might argue that you can write nested stuff in every languages. True enough BUT it seems like the philosophy in python is more about making things clearer and using more function if it makes everything simpler/easier to maintain and understand.. while in practically all lisps code I read, it feels like it is a write-only code without thought about you will read it after.<p>Is it because all the ""Here's why lisp is better"" are written by new-lisper who are too much excited  as they can now use closures and nest everything rather than using simple, yet useful, normal functions?<p>When I read lisps forum, it's always about how that or that doesn't support tail recursive function or why macro rocks everything, but never talking about readability and good practices about not nesting everything up. Yeah, they say to use real editor, to never look at the (), to align thing smartly.. I don't know for you, but I feel like my brain works in a kind of stack. I can put some stuff in my short memory, but I can't put more than say 5-6 stuff at once.  And when I see this:<p><pre><code>    (let [width (inc (apply max (map (comp count values) squares)))

</code></pre>
It just seem too much to read it quickly; I need to stop and think. Yeah, some laugh at me saying ""Yeah, you need to </i>think*! You are not used to that! Well, no, when I'm reading a book, I like to think about the concept or the story, not trying to figure out how to read that complicated sentence.<p>When I read python code, I think about pattern, modularity, what's the goal of the actual file. When I'm reading lisp, I can't go quickly into it because of those 10 levels nested function.<p>/end of rant.",1301505433

I've just started a point by point reply and I've realised that I really don't care.  I'll let people who do care argue the pros and cons - I don't think it matters, it won't change.

I first came to this site when PG asked me to submit a link that I'd sent him.  If I'd had to accumulate karma before submitting I wouldn't be here.  Perhaps that's themain thing that bothers me about such barriers to entry.  The really clever people I personally know would mostly just not bother and go elsewhere.  Many of the mediocre people would stay, comment, get karma, and feel a sense of accomplishment.<p>Who would you rather have?<p><pre><code>  > At this point I believe we are in danger of taking

It's just not necessary or logical.<p>14 hours across the countryor even 8 hours at nearly twice the viable speedwill never match the speed or efficiency of air travel.<p>High speed rail can compete in the regional corridors where it makes sense.

In just 10 years, Amtrak has captured 75% of the traffic between NYC and DC, and over 50% of the traffic between NYC and Boston. It's phenomenal. At my office, nobody takes flights between NYC/PHL/DC anymore. Why go out to LaGuardia when you can walk over to Penn Station, enjoy WiFi and a ton of leg room, not to mention a snack car, and get there in about the same amount of time as flying? Oh, and you're dropped off right in downtown DC, instead of Reagan or in the god forsaken suburbs if you're unlucky enough to land in Dulles.<p>And Amtrak isn't even very good! Years of neglect and bad regulation have left the service with old cars (except Acela), crumbling infrastructure, etc. But it beats the hell out of air travel, and the differential will only get more dramatic as fuel prices continue to increase.",1360547805

They also assumed you would not be able to command-click a link to open it in a new tab.<p>Surprisingly to many, both work just great in Discourse; try it out if you don't believe me.<p>Many people also held on to the belief that JavaScript apps are fundamentally incompatible with assistive software; that one is also a common misconception that's just not true anymore.

Reaching the $400-500 price range requires low end specs, but also requires a single SKU that can be mass produced cheaply.<p>Since alot of the major OEMs (Dell, HP, Lenovo, etc.) have already made major investments in products (Thinkpad, Inspiron, etc.) for design that is focused on the head end and highly configurable, they don't spend resources producing the low end.  Instead they all of the R&D cost have been spent creating one design that is very configurable, which results in design tradeoffs (swapable parts causes laptop to be bigger, etc.) in order for them.<p>Apple is successful partially because they have VERY few SKUs, a small number of models, which enables to them to easily reach scale and spend all their money on design.   There is no equivalent because the margins at the $400-500 are very low and if OEMs have to spend large amount on design for something with low margin that can't be scaled up to high end, the ROI is not there.",1360546958

Because the logo source is the original homepage (I.E. it's an original resource location) the malicious individual doesn't now need to have a local copy of the logo.<p>This is why the original resource provider that hosts the logo would need to have a whitelist of which sites may allow their logo to be displayed. Of course, if a whitelisted site is compromised, then you still have the same problem.<p>It would also mean that there is the potential for a man-in-the middle attack by injecting code to the SVG file as it is delivered through the widget. Some browsers may allow scripting to be executed (since SVG is basically XML) if the script is within a CDATA block. If the original resouce location is compromised, then pretty much anyone using the direct link to the logo (be it widget, website or other consumer service) may end up receiving an unpleasant package with the logo.<p>This can be corrected by proper browser standards that don't allow execution of code within SVG files, so I hope in that regard it does catch on. Overall, it's a good idea that still has a few hiccups, but that's mostly due to browser/consumer security issues that need to be corrected.",1360546940

I went Windows more or less since then and was pretty happy with whatever I had since then.<p>A few months ago my work got me a MBPr (much to my chagrin at the time) running Mountain Lion, and you know what? It ain't bad. My boss insisted that I give it a shot for a few months and if I still didn't like it they'd call up dell and get me whatever I wanted there.<p>Most of the initial problems I patiently chalked up to re-familiarizing myself with the OS, especially in the ways it's subtly changed since 2006.<p>Off the top of my head<p>The good:\nI don't think I can get a better system for spinning up 2 or 3 simultaneous VMs eating 3-4 gig of RAM a piece and having the whole system still run blindingly fast.<p>CMD+Space to find stuff works pretty brilliantly most of the time.<p>Searching for help is usually more helpful than I was expecting. I've almost always gotten help from the OS in clever and useful ways. The control panel search for example, is far superior to Windows.<p>When SSDs were first introduced I was skeptical, expensive and the space seemed far to small to be productive. I still wish I had about a TB of space like my old Dell had, but I'm just a bit more judicious about what I jam on there. SSDs were definitely the right way to go. I feel like I'm working on a $300,000 piece of server equipment.<p>The high DPI, bright screen is really nice to look at all day. I don't really think non-retina art looks like shit the way lots of pundits make it out to be, and overall looking at stuff is great.<p>There's some cool OS X only stuff out there where there's not really a good Windows variant. My favorite has to be Cathode. But there's lots of interesting looking writing and creativity software as well.<p>The trackpad really is that good. The barely functional PoS on my 2006 MBP had me tricked that any old trackpad on any old laptop was more or less the same. But I actually prefer to use the trackpad on my MBPr to a mouse. It's really more a size than a texture thing, but there's some slick software backing it up, movements are precise and the cursor goes more or less where I want it. Gestures are cool even if I only use 3 or 4 of them and they function <i>much</i> better than their Windows equivalents. I really do like two finger scrolling much better.<p>Multiple desktops work really well. I keep work stuff on one desktop, and personal/break stuff on another and fine transitioning really easy and helpful in compartmentalizing my day.<p>Notifications are better than in Windows. I'm actually usually pleased to receive a notification in OS X, whereas in Windows it seems like such an annoyance. Icons in the toolbar jumping up and down is also helpful. I don't autohide or zoom my toolbar, but I like it in general.<p>The physical hardware is awesome. It slips away into my backback so nicely I have to double check that it's actually in there.<p>A decent number of connectors for peripherals.<p>It does relatively smart things when connecting up extra monitors.<p>The keyboard is quiet, but really comfortable to type on.<p>The bad:\nI spend 90% of my time in terminal window or a web browser, things for which most of the good things above are entirely superfluous. Plus Chrome has some annoying hard edges that make it work worse in OS X than in Windows. I could literally get along just fine with my Android tablet and a keyboard for what I spend almost all day doing.<p>Window management is in general, worse than in Windows. Complaints include: tiny, over precise click targets, buttons on the top of windows which have unpredictable behavior, closing all open windows doesn't close the app (leaving zombie apps open and pissing me off 6 or 7 times a day), the menu bar is detached from the app window and with the poor maximization behavior makes knowing what application I'm in a confusing mess that bits me at least 3 times a day, unbelievably small and frigidity scroll bar target. Coming from windows, I never really got why Fitt's law was such a big deal to Mac users, now banging around this clumsy environment I finally get it. It's almost impossible to accurately and easily move things about your workspace. Better to just open the app and let it be and then get to work and just deal with whatever the window is doing.<p>Mouses suck in OS X. After some serious consideration I think it's that the OS has been subtly optimized for the trackpad. But it's subtly an inferior experience to mousing about in Windows (while the inverse is also true, Trackpads are inferior in Windows). Acceleration curve is never quite right, mouse wheels track in less predictable ways, and for legacy reasons right mouse button is very much an afterthought.<p>I find I'm often surprised at what <i>isn't</i> in the OS and results in getting nickle and dimed by the ecosystem to ""complete the OS"". Really no basic paint program?<p>Why, oh why, do I have to play finger twister all day with keyboard shortcuts? Really? Some of this shit is unbelievable. CMD+CTRL+SHIFT+4, Space, click and yay! I've taken a screenshot of a window! You have got to be kidding me. Far far too much is buried in the OS, and undiscoverable, behind layers of program altering button combinations...it's so bad that even lists of common shortcuts don't work half the time!<p>Office on windows is a hair better. There's lots of nice touches in Office, so it's not punishment to use it. But the Ribbon/menus just work better in Windows...no surprise.<p>It's more unstable that Windows (at least since XP). Sorry, it just is. I have to reboot my Mac at least twice a week and all I really do on it is use Chrome, terminal, ssh and run a few VMs. My creaky 5 year old home machine running 7 hasn't been rebooted in a couple months and generally doesn't flake out. I've heard this is a recent Mountain Lionish issue from the rest of the folks in my shop, but still.<p>The ugly:\nFinder is an absolute abortion of a file management tool. I could go on for pages and pages, but virtually every single thing in Finder is done wrong. From the default behavior for Enter to just simply knowing where the fuck you are in the file system. Explorer is light years better. I feel like I'm constantly stuck in an emulator showing me the worst of early 1990s file management tools from an Amiga.<p>Multi-monitor support is just...broken. It feels like such an afterthought, and other than turning things on and moving windows around smartly, almost every other activity after that feels subtly broken. It's hard to explain, but the best and most notable example is Mountain lions full-screen mode...which works brilliantly on the laptop by itself, but fails entirely in multi-monitor mode. This something windows hasn't had a problem with for something nearing 20 years. It's not that hard. It's also in multi-monitor mode that the failure of ideas that the menubar is starts to become rapidly apparent. Having to pad on my trackpad across two monitors to click a menu, then pad all they way back to where I was is a distracting waste of my time.<p>There's an uncountable number of ways to switch between applications and programs, yet none of them are as simple or reliable as windows. cmd-tab switches programs, but I spend half my day hunting around for the window I thought I had open, only for it to be minimized or behind another window. Moving to the toolbar means taking my hands off the keyboard, and on and on and on. CMD+` doesn't work in every application reliably.<p>I have <i>yet</i> to conceive of even the slightest use for the Dashboard.<p>I have other, smaller praises and gripes, but none of them rise to the level of daily notice like the above do. But overall, I feel generally happy in my computing experience during my work day. I don't feel like I'm in a penalty box when I fire up my work laptop and being able to my work without too much fuss is decent.<p>Some of the nice things in the OS make me feel like windows is a bit clunky in appearance when I go back to my home machine. OS X overall definitely <i>feels</i> smoother in most respects. Even simple things, like a built in SSH client are huge.<p>But once I adjust back to Windows, and realize I can stop fighting with basic file management issues and other OS X complaints I have, I find I still personally prefer Windows for my personal use. Most of the stuff I want to do in my off-time is Windows only (or the Windows version is simply better), and so that's that. I just don't see me buying a Mac for personal use as none of the things that are offered by the software ecosystem appeal to me in a holistic way. There are spotlight of brilliance that's for sure, but on the whole I still think Windows offers a better, more diversified and more vibrant ecosystem overall.",1360545058

Provided you can actually configure it with $EDITOR + /etc/pf.conf.\nHaving a GUI for PF doesn't make much sense when you have a rules syntax that is as expressive as PF's. There may be some edge cases where netfilter can do things that would require a work around in PF but in my eyes the latter wins when you look at the features + tooling + configuring package. Also there are some things PF can do that netfilter can't.",1360544701

The ""Diplom"" and ""Magister"" closely resembles the US master's degree, so their proliferation is lower when comparing to _all_ degrees in other countries.  \nHowever it has been replaced by BA/BS and MA/MS between 2005 and 2010, so you can expect more BAs to enter the labor market today. \n<a href=""http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abitur"" rel=""nofollow"">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abitur</a> it states that 43% of an age group get the Abitur, and most of them attend university according to <a href=""http://www.kmk.org/fileadmin/pdf/PresseUndAktuelles/2011/eag_2011_Lange_PM.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kmk.org/fileadmin/pdf/PresseUndAktuelles/2011/eag...</a>. That document also states that some 28% of the population get a university (undergratuate/graduate) degree today.\nOn the other hand, more people do apprenticeships in Germany than in other countries (without nessaraily having an Abitur  degree), and those apprenticeships are accompanied by classes and an associate degree which can be extended to a ""meister"" of some sort. Some studies are regarded as apprenticeship that would be taught at colleges in other countries (e.g. patient care). If you add those degrees they make up another 15% of an age group. So in total that's something like 43% which I think would be comparable to US numbers.",1360544639

In the branching paradigm, only one execution path requires a jump at all, and that jump is made based on an offset embedded directly into the machine code, so the additional pointer lookup is not needed.<p>So, I'm going to come down on the side of the traditional model being inherently more performant.",1360544431

And the functional style encourages better separation of concerns, again making it easier to change something in one place. Strong typing is really good in a large codebase for making it harder for errors to propagate - if you make an error in a given function that changes the return type, you can immediately localise the problem to that function.<p>Writing the initial code is likely to be if anything slower in a functional language; the real advantage comes in maintenance.<p>(disclaimer: I don't actually know haskell, though I've used several functional languages and written functional-style code in several more)",1348840743

The language is so damn pragmatic.  Programmers who enjoy snapping together executables in shell will feel at home with Tcl.  It functions like a portable shell.  Also, Tcl embodies the philosophy of simplicity in implementation better any other software I've encountered; the C API is simplicity itself.  It's actually a great way to organize large programs too, just make the commands do more work with C algorithms and data structures and expose less text-output-chatter to Tcl, in other words, make the commands do ""big"" things and glue them together in Tcl.  It's BSD licensed.  It has a surprising number of packages due to it being so trivial to convert existing C libraries to Tcl commands using the dead simple API.<p>I'm surprised more open source OSs (Linux & BSDs) have chosen Ruby, Python, and Perl as opposed to Tcl.

Source code for the framework was available in the default flex builder installation. Wanna see how adobe designed the default table renderer, drop right in and look. You didn't have to search online for how to use esoteric features, you could just look at the super class to see the code path it takes. This is my biggest complaint working with Apple and MS frameworks.<p>2. Proper handling of component invalidation. Many other frameworks still have problems with calling methods out of order during initialization. Flex collects all changes to a component before processing them in the invalidation loop.<p>3. Data binding let you do some really cool things by automatically wrapping them in anonymous functions to process like\n<mx:Button id=""myButton"" enabled=""{isButtonEnabled(someString, items.length)}""/><p>4. Lots of support for component customization, especially in the skinning department. Going from flex back to mac cocoa was like going from paintbrushes back to using twigs to draw.<p>However, the biggest downfall for flash was always the performance, they were stuck in a corner because the flash engine was designed first and foremost for processing frames of animation, on the cpu, in another programs window, with no control over their own run loop.",1348839181

4585351,comment,4585175,4585175,46,0,dctoedt,,,"When you think about it, patent examiners make industrial policy that affects the entire United States for up to 20 years. To be fair, the USPTO takes that responsibility pretty seriously.  Still, examiners are human --- and a lot of them aren't experienced enough to have signature authority: their actions must be signed by their supervisors, who have to oversee multiple junior examiners. In many fields, the examining corps is pretty buried by the workload and doesn't have the time or other resources they'd like to have.  [EDIT:  In response to 'dkhenry, I agree, there's no excuse for the patent being discussed here.]<p>This examiner burden is exacerbated by three things:<p>First, patent examiners' performance is graded in part on the basis of a ""count system,"" which provides at least some incentive for examiners to allow at least some claims [1].<p>Second, the statute mandates that a patent be issued unless the examiner can demonstrate that the application is <i>not</i> patentable.<p>Third, there's no requirement that a patent applicant conduct any kind of patentability search.  An applicant and his patent attorney must disclose any ""material"" prior art <i>of which they're aware,</i> but the applicant need not do any kind of literature search.  [EDIT: When you apply for a patent, you pay filing fees in part to help cover some of the cost of having a patent examiner do a search.]<p>Just imagine if a PhD candidate wasn't required to do a literature survey as part of her dissertation work, but instead her advisor and thesis committee were required to approve her degree unless <i>they</i> and their TAs could affirmatively demonstrate that her research was insufficiently novel. That's not unlike the way it works in the patent system.  And now think of how much more national impact can result from the issuance of a patent compared to the issuance of a PhD degree.<p>Inventors and patent attorneys tend to fiercely oppose any proposal that patent applicants be required to conduct prior-art searches, on grounds that it would increase the cost of a patent application. But if an inventor wants a national industrial policy to be made in his favor that will last for as much as 20 years, it doesn't seem <i>per se</i> unreasonable for society to require him to do some due diligence first.<p>(Of course, as long as the law is what it is, patent applicants, including my own clients, will quite properly abide by the law as it is and not as some might think it ought to be.)<p>Richard Stallman once asserted, in testimony at the USPTO [2], that:<p>--snip--<p><i>Some years ago a professor I know patented Kirchoff's current law, which says that the electric currents flowing into a junction equal the currents flowing out.  He did this to confirm, privately, his suspicion that the PTO could not handle the field of electronics.  He never tried to enforce the patent which has since expired.  I will disclose his name if you give assurances that he and his lawyer will not get in trouble for this.</i><p><i>Kirchoff's laws were formulated in 1845.

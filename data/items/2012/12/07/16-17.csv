While cyberwar (which is a dumb term) hasn't yet resulted in 'real' causalities I think using that as a metric is outdated. Cyberwar will never have the same strategy as traditional war. Economic havoc and infrastructure disruption will be the name of the game and with the right set of environmental circumstances a small group of people can have a huge impact on the world stage.<p>I believe non-state actors will be a powerful force in this arena.

4887798,comment,4887345,4887345,21,0,geophile,,,"Dinosaur here. I think that these social programming ideas are nuts. At my first job writing production software, we did three things. We brainstormed. We wrote and critiqued designs. We coded (which includes writing unit tests and debugging).<p>There was basically no open source. If we needed something, we found it in libc, or wrote it, and if it was good, others in the company used it too.<p>It was incredibly productive and satisfying.<p>At my current company, I find much less up-front design.  We don't do pair programming, so the collaboration tends to be at the end of the process, during code review. And good god, there is no end to the code reviews. I don't understand how anyone can do both good code reviews, and good software development. There isn't enough time or attention for both. I notice that when we're getting toward the end of a release, there is all sorts of shorthand in the code reviews. Reviews like ""looks good to me"", ""nothing jumps out at me"", ""I only did a cursory scan"", etc. This is shorthand for ""our process requires code review, so I'm claiming that I've done a code review, but really I haven't."" So we end up with no collaborative design at times. And of course, when code review does work, we're finding design flaws late.<p>There is far less NIH these days, and that's a good thing. There are high quality projects out there, and you can grab one, evaluate it, and save yourself a lot of time. This saves time on building things that are tangential to whatever it is you are trying to do.<p>But reuse can also go wrong in a few ways. You may spend a lot of time wading through crap. You may try something out, commit to it, and then discover the flaws only much later. You can spend a lot of time finding an open source solution to a problem, learn the API, tweak the internals to improve the fit, and then in hindsight realize that you would have been better off just writing the thing yourself. Frameworks are especially prone to this problem. Yes, they do a lot of things for you, but you have to drink so much kool aid to get the benefit. And then there is inertia, and you tend to fight the framework once you stray from the exact approved way in which it's supposed to be used.  Another problem with just downloading something is that your less talented developers tend not to question how the thing works, and not have a good understanding of how it is best used, and what you'd better not try.<p>What I find is that with all this browsing, and downloading, and trying things out, and making things fit, and reading code, and fixing trivial things demanded by the process, and in general, just doing things in the modern way -- there is just no time for thinking about things hard, forming an idea, and taking the time to express it cleanly.<p>I won't even get into the latest, highly interactive project management cults. Daily scrums are the modern equivalent of TPS reports.<p>I haven't tried pair programming and I never will. I'll leave a job if asked to pair program. I'll leave the profession if necessary and program as a hobby. For me, the reason I put up with all the nonsense is those few hours a week when I can actually get a nice problem to work on, think about it, come up with a solution, make it simpler, simpler, simpler, code it, make it simpler some more, and make it fast. Put on the music, get into the zone, and think and hack. Seems much harder to do in recent years.",1354899110

However my suspicion is that there's a much less sexy practice, also primarily promoted as a way to prevent defects, that could do the job much more efficiently: Regular code reviews.<p>I'm really only thinking that way for one simple reason:  In  pair programming, a normal conversation will involve only two people. That means that when a concept's being explained, it's being explained to only one other person.  When a new idea's being vetted, it's being vetted by only one other person.  When a future challenge is being considered, it's being considered by only one other person.  That's always seemed horribly inefficient to me, considering that with a code review you could stick six people around a projector and achieve the same spread of information in as little as one fifth of the time.<p>That said, for other tasks such as getting new developers up to speed and integrated into the team I doubt there's anything better.",1354899079

I know and use the correct terminology, but I don't get bent out of shape if the person I'm talking to doesn't know it.  Especially when their mistake is obvious and I can correct for it in my head.  I don't see how it is ""toxic"" to be lenient when talking to non-specialists who misuse terminology.<p>By and large -- and, hey, you'll think this statement is toxic -- people who spend a lot of time worrying about whether something is called a ""percent"" or a ""percentage point"", outside the context of a classroom, do not know what they're talking about and have no business teaching anyone how to interpret statistics.  Sometimes a change from 10% to 12% matters a lot.  Sometimes it doesn't.  Sometimes it would matter a lot, but is estimated so imprecisely as to be indistinguishable from noise.  Sometimes it is measured very precisely but is meaningless.  I could go on.  This context-dependence is true whether you call it a percent, a percentage point, or just a ""change.""<p>Most smart people understand this regardless of their statistical training.  But then they read that, no, what really matters is what people <i>call</i> the change, and then they either 1) conclude that statisticians are pedantic morons who should be ignored and/or 2) psych themselves out and doubt their instincts and wind up worrying about trivial, trivial shit.<p>Communication is important, but not the way you claim.  It is important that specialists (be they statisticians, programmers, whatever) be able to explain things to clients/nonspecialists.  It is also important that the specialists be able to interpret what the clients/nonspecialists want to understand and do.  The burden falls entirely on the specialist, and any guide that spends any amount of effort to get nonspecialists to use the ""correct"" terminology is misguided and wasted at best.  Which is what I meant by the ""toxic"" statement, ""but if the other person calls it the wrong thing, I don't really care.""",1354898943

It is hard to demand that everyone know every language, so a lingua franca (English in this case) is all right.<p>What I meant to say is that languages are becoming more and more plain.  It seems people - and sometimes with language institutions with them - are accepting that the languages should be less complicated, so we can say the same thing with fewer words.<p>An obvious example is people writing 'u' instead of 'you', but is actually even more obvious in other languages than English.  For instance, I am not a fan of people saying 'issues' in Danish, when we have the word problemstillinger, simply because the English word 'issues' is shorter.  Should English use arv instead of 'inheritance' because it is shorter?<p>Languages' vocabularies shouldn't cherry-pick.<p>I do not oppose a lingua franca, I merely advocate keeping each language separate.",1354897641

Also, the network and connection management stuff is painful if you have to switch between 3.5G and WiFi.

Cluttered thoughts<p>When I develop software, very little of that time is spent typing. If you were to watch me program, what you'd see is someone sitting in a chair doing nothing. Before I write a single line of code, I'll examine my future program in my head, poking, prodding, trying out different approaches, weighing the benefits, considering edge cases, and so on. I cannot do this if distracted by talking or typing, as it clutters up my thought process (unless the task is quite trivial). Because of this, pair sessions tend to be awkward, with me not saying much and not typing much 90% of the time. What I can do effectively is design a system and then ask someone to critique it before I start coding it out.<p>2. Social exhaustion<p>I have a hard enough time dealing with the exhausting process of social interaction as it is. I don't avoid it entirely, because I know that it's important. However, my mental stamina is also important if I'm going to be doing anything useful, so I try to strike a balance between social obligation and isolation. I've never paired for more than a couple of hours, which is draining and becomes stressful before long. I can only imagine that I'd be climbing the walls after 8 hours of that.<p>3. The zone<p>I like programming in the zone. Everything becomes so easy and flows so nicely, but it can sometimes take a long time to get into the zone, and it's fragile and breaks easily.

Even single developers may need to roll back in time or read notes from a few months ago about why they made an obscure change.  It's worth the minimal overhead to have the protection, historical data, and in a multi-user scenario, to know who's doing what so you don't step on each other's toes.<p>Whatever solution you choose, go hosted; it's straightforward, secure, and saves you the trouble of having to manage disaster recovery, network issues, and so on.

Subsequent calls can then specify the values for the rest.<p>The mechanism we use for this is to do some ruby metaprogramming to kludge in some placeholder values for the uncurried values, and then gsub them in in the subsequent passes. (So, the first pass is the only pass that runs the HAML/ERB file, the rest are gsub's) This works for us, since things after the first pass are not changing layout, etc, and need to be high performance. The first pass is a heavyweight rendering at a coarse granularity (and cached), subsequent curries are lightweight gsubs at fine grain.",1242680038

I would agree that many entrepreneurs come out of childhood situations where their family struggled through chaotic situations (characterized by uncertain future, time spent living on the margin, etc.), but that the key element is that the family can remain functional and successful in these conditions, thus being closer to the exact opposite of what is normally categorized as ""dysfunctional"".

Slow-twitch muscles are used in maintaining posture and light activity and burn primarily fat.  Fast-twitch muscles are used for strength and burn primarily glucose.  Hard exercise like he suggests would use mostly glucose.  Walking slowly while working 8 hrs a day (treadmill desk) would presumably use more fat.

Perhaps by virtue of the font size, Proggy has a lowercase L that can pass for a vertical bar at a glimpse.

We know how many acres are being destroyed each year from across the world. Because historical measures are so good, we are able to know if the rates of deforestation are increasing or decreasing. If countries are able to decrease their rates of deforestation from the historical baseline then they get carbon credits under certain cap-and-trade models. They are then able to sell these credits at auction.<p>Because preserving an acre of rainforest is far less expensive than reducing CO2 in more traditional ways, we can reduce the total amount of CO2 in the atmosphere for less money than it would otherwise cost.",1242677807

Particularly notable was how inexpensive Adidas brand walking shoes were. Another peculiarity of the local economy was how little cost was added to the price of food by eating out. Yes, restaurant food was more expensive than food prepared at home, but not by nearly the same factor as restaurant food is in the United States.<p>But note that these comparisons are by nominal prices, at official exchange rates. Wages were also much lower in Taiwan in those days. I had a high-wage occupation (teaching English as a foreign language), so I was living large in the local economy, but even so I wasn't saving up much money for my return to the United States.<p>Most immigrants to the United States, from an enormous variety of countries, find that they can work fewer hours per week to buy the things they most desire than they could in the countries they left. That's why the direction of immigration flows between the United States and almost all other countries results in the United States having a net gain of population by immigration. When people compare their opportunities in the States with their opportunities in the country where they grew up, they mostly think that the United States offers a quite good trade-off. And that's not even to get into issues such as less corrupt government officials or less polluted air and water.<p><i>The more hands through which that money passes between the producer and the consumer, the more money is lost to waste.</i><p>The best research in economics results in a contrary conclusion.

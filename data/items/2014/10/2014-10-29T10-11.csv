And the countries that are likely to get some positive agricultural benefit are the northern countries which are among the most developed countries in the world.<p>Netherlands has cities multiple meters below sea level. The western major coastal cities can be shielded from a few meters of sea level increase - it would cost immense (but still realistic) amounts of money, but the heavily inhabited coastal regions of poor countries will simply drown and cause many millions of displaced poor people.<p>The effects matter to the poor countries more than everybody else. I&#x27;d say there are two reasons why they&#x27;re not doing anything to stop it - first is the tragedy of commons, as it makes no sense for, say, Bangladesh (probably risking the worst effects from global warming) to stop emissions if China isn&#x27;t doing the same; and second is simply that they can&#x27;t afford to pay today for a larger benefit tomorrow; in the same manner as poor people often simply can&#x27;t pay $10 now to prevent a certain $50 loss in a month.",1414579578

The integral is a rectangles-approximation-to-an-area using infinitely thin rectangles, and series are summation procedures with infinite number of steps.<p>High school math deals with procedures with finite number of steps, whereas in calculus we learn to use infinity as part of our calculations.

8526343,comment,8526208,8526208,0,0,chton,,,"There are conversations that work on twitter, and ones that don&#x27;t.  In general, twitter conversations are quick back-and-forth affairs. If you need more than 2 tweets to express your thought, you&#x27;re either using the wrong medium or thinking too far.  If that conversation model doesn&#x27;t fit you, that&#x27;s perfectly fine, but that&#x27;s not the fault of twitter.  It&#x27;s just a bad match-up.  In that case, it&#x27;s perfectly fine to respond to a tweet with a link to a medium that does support your model better.<p>If you do get roped into a conversation where you need more tweets to explain, here&#x27;s a few simple guidelines:<p>- Don&#x27;t split sentences over tweets. People will only read one part.<p>- If you really must, use &quot;(cont.)&quot; on both tweets (end of the first and start of the second), so it&#x27;s obvious there was another part.  I know that reduces your character limit, but it&#x27;s worth it to be less ambiguous<p>- Make each continued tweet a reply to its predecessor. You can reply to your own tweets. It facilitates following the conversation on most clients.<p>- If it&#x27;s more than 2 tweets, consider using twitlonger.  In general, that should be a last resort, though.<p>Without trying to make it sound high-handed, there&#x27;s something of an art to smooth twitter conversations.  Terseness is the key.

Forcing them is not going to make them happy.""<p>This leads to a dangerous line of thinking. There will always be a group of users who are resistant to change, and during a time of change they will be most vocal. If you listen to them you'll stagnate -- which is almost always the kiss-of-death for a company like Twitter. To be innovative you have to take risks and that includes the risk of angering certain people.",1315569543

I don't see how attaching premium benefits to filing could possibly improve that situation.<p>Greater efficiency is grand. The fairness between two competing inventors is situational, seems like lateral movement at best.<p>As to the flood of obvious patents crushing innovation?

Plenty of brands have caught on to this and actually share 90%+ of the basic design of the car and concentrate on the interior to differentiate the brands. The biggest difference on the outside is the logo on the hood.<p>Once physics and usability enter in to the design process the constraints can be such that there will be fewer and fewer options and room to play without impacting those in a negative way.<p>Design is always a compromise. By going for a minimalist design you remove all of that room so any minimalist design for a device will likely be very much like every other minimalist design.",1315569428

Samsungs next step probably will be to appeal this case at the ""Oberlandesgericht"". If they also loose there they can appeal the case at the BGH (""Bundesgerichtshof""), which is the highest german court for such court cases (the ""Bundesverfassungsgericht"" would be a higher court, but only handles matters of constitution).

I don't want to give away the specifics yet, but it's an ajax tool that allows you to tinker with some controls, and each time you do that it generates a dynamic output image of approx 100k. It's something you might use anywhere from just as a last-resort lookup, to an essential tool for a job/hobby that takes up every second of your spare time. At 100k per click, that'll add up lightning fast, and if it hits the right audience I can see it getting swamped. There's a few national magazines on the subject that sing the praises of much less impressive tools - one mention there and it could be adios! :/<p>Consequently, I wouldn't know where to start in estimating bandwidth use, and that's really all the cost I'll have until I'm ready to market it. The cost-free limit on my current host is 15G/month, but I haven't got the time/resources to set up anything better just yet. I have no money to throw at this, at all, no matter what. I'm in a situation where it costs me nothing or I put it off for a year :(<p>So, I'm planning to do this as a freemium with a fairly hefty restriction on the free and usage-bracketed costs on the premium so as to be fair, but I'm still scared the numbers might not add up and that the freemium could potentially cost me an arm and a leg before I even notice.<p>Does anyone have any nuggets of advice that might help? Even if it's just ""It's a risk, get over it"" :) I'd rather not abandon the freemium idea (pictures of it in action are OK, but using it is a hundred times better), but maybe the slower, safer approach of only using bandwidth that's already paid for is warranted for a skint coward?",1315567679

And since there is so little text, you should increase the size of the text. Computer monitors are designed to be read from a distance of about 1.5 feet or more and your text is a bit too small to be read comfortably from that distance (I got weak eyes). You should bump up the text size by maybe 2 points.<p>Also, you should have a longer page where you explain the specifics of the app. Like for example when I click the read more link on the login page, I expect it to take me to a page explaining in detail about the app, and how it can help me with maybe a comparison with similar apps. Instead it takes me back to the landing page, which doesn't really explain too much.",1246255103

678538,comment,678398,678460,0,0,JimmyL,,,">> the software is very simple and could be duplicated very quickly<p>As is said so many times in what we do, if it's that simple why don't you hire a few hackers for a few weeks, build it, and then compete with them? SE has a very polished platform, unbeatable service (presumably, since it's backed by Fog Creek), and a great sample implementation that you can look at to see exactly how much information is exchanged/value is added to your network. They've also got Joel and Jeff, two very prominent voices in the space.<p>As for the price point, I don't think they're going for small five-person shops. My guess would be that they've got two markets targeted:<p>* The internal company knowledge base. In this, they'd be taking a run at a small part of Confluence, and the price point doesn't really matter. If you're in this space, $3K/month is nothing if it makes a production team more efficient.<p>* Support/community building for a third-party product. Most company support forums are, after all, basically a way for people to ask questions to fellow users/administrators. So why not optimize on a system that's designed specifically around asking and answering questions, as opposed to a form that's meant for discussions? What immediately comes to mind, for example, is BlackBerry third-party software development. It's not bad once you've got the hang of it, but it has a lot of tricky parts to get going and optimize. So RIM would get an SE site going and say ""we encourage everyone to ask their questions here, and we'll have a team of a few community relations people hang out here to do what they can."" Gives the community a focal point, and in a way that promotes getting things done, as opposed to complaining. Think of it like a version of GetSatisfaction for technical support.",1246252361

678536,comment,678330,678330,0,0,kragen,,,"So maybe this secrecy was justifiable. But maybe it wasn't. Here's a list of parties who would have benefited from the information:<p>- Other reporters and nonprofit workers considering going to Afghanistan. How many of your colleagues have been kidnapped doing something you're considering doing is pretty useful information. Even if you still decide to do it, you might demand extra compensation for the risk. The editors of the New York Times may have saved themselves substantial hazard pay by keeping this secret.
- The kidnappers, obviously, who apparently represent the former government of Afghanistan. This might seem unremarkable (who would side with the kidnappers, after all?) except that it is very unusual for Wikipedia to take sides in a contentious international issue like this, even in cases where there are clear issues of right and wrong (Scientology, Guantánamo, the US's support for terrorist guerrillas in Nicaragua in the 1970s, etc.) There's a strong tradition of letting the reader decide.
- Old friends of David Rohde wondering why they hadn't heard from him in months.
- Anyone who, in the future, seeks information that fairly presents all sides of an issue without the fear that some sides have been entirely suppressed. (This is the first such case, to my knowledge.) I imagine this case will be brought up every time some kid from a radical madrasa tries to convince his buddies that actually the US did take action to save Muslims from persecution in Bosnia, using Wikipedia and the sources it cites to make his case.<p>I agree that there is a plausible case to make that secrecy was the lesser of the evils, but I don't think it's an open-and-shut case.

8012471,comment,8012263,8012263,1,0,bayesianhorse,,,"On the issue of efficiency of Prozac or similar drugs, sometimes the explanation is that they simply work and you know it if you have taken them. I found the effects of SSRIs very noticeable, and every doctor prescribing them knows of patients who suddenly were able to leave the bed, or deeply depressive patients switching into a manic episode. The latter might not sound like an improvement, but for the patients, quality of life improves immensely. This can explain why doctors and regulators look favourably on drugs with a long history of clinical use.<p>I&#x27;d also criticize the conclusion that there&#x27;s nothing better than Aspirin on the market. Which hasn&#x27;t been known since ancient times by the way. The original salicylic acid was much worse on the stomach. Both Ibuprofene and Diclofenac have better analgesic properties, again very noticeable, and metamizole has different properties, again much more useful than asparin. There&#x27;s really nothing to argue with that, except some hand-waving &quot;placebo&quot; talk, which often isn&#x27;t so scientific either.<p>I&#x27;m more familiar with the veterinary side of things, and there the situation is that there are both independant trials, and a sort of &quot;grapevine&quot; where veterinarians compare notes on different drugs.<p>You can&#x27;t really argue with anesthesia drugs. Either they work or they don&#x27;t. Either they have a high incidence of accidents in a particular species, or they don&#x27;t. Antibiotics much the same, especially when performing individual lab tests. Sure there is a lot of hyperbole or bad advertising, but it&#x27;s not just &quot;bad pharma&quot;.",1404943032

8012467,comment,8010719,8012293,3,0,ggchappell,,,"> Continuing in the &quot;let me Google that for you&quot; vein, both QNX and various L4 family microkernels are in use in a variety of embedded systems; QNX is also in the new Blackberry products. There&#x27;s a number of very mature security oriented research microkernels (like L4se and K42) that could very well show up in commercial products eventually. But that&#x27;s back to needing to know more about computer science than Windows and MacOS.<p>Let&#x27;s be fair here. Your claim was that microkernels are &quot;in general use&quot;. Ongoing research, however mature, does not support this claim. And Blackberry is hardly the heavy hitter they used to be. Meanwhile, the major OSs for computers as <i>computers</i> -- and as phones -- have backed away from the microkernel design. Maybe they shouldn&#x27;t have; regardless, they <i>did</i>.<p>That leaves embedded systems. And there you have a point. So: microkernels are in common use in embedded systems.

So I have some background experience in the theory and practice of file sharing in clouds, public and private).<p>I find it really interesting they concluded they had to build an alternative because they considered public clouds insecure and non private.  Making such a decision has to take into account a very large amount of information (and they should be talking closely with potential vendors to get that information).<p>How do we know the university department will do a better job?  It&#x27;s been two years since they started the project and they have just begun procurement.  They have a single vendor.  How are they dealing with security and privacy- unlike a cloud company whose reputation is on the line, for whom this is an existential threat?<p>Running a 6Pbyte cloud is a non-trivial matter.  There are large capital costs as well as operational costs (you have to buy and run lots of servers, employ 24/7 admins, etc).  If you purchase a service, it&#x27;s just operational (and you need far fewer admins).<p>Many US universities are already moving their IT departments to Amazon, Google, and Microsoft clouds.

This will bias you towards covering the newest, churniest stuff that is causing people pain right now<p>- Do like RailsCasts and alternate between free and paid videos.

Proof of work and distributed networks are why bitcoin and others are more complex than a list of node URLs and a simple database model.<p>After looking through code, a number of concerns are also raised:<p>- key pairs use RSA\n- identities are based on MD5 of RSA public key\n- no p2p protocol for nodes\n- lack of proof of work (more on that below)<p>As-is, the project is a rails application which references accounts by MD5 of the public key, a postgresql database, and a REST client. In other words -- basic rails ledger app plus some PKI.<p>I see a significant issue with hyperledger, in that the pools are, by nature, private. The only verification a client can perform is the SSL certificate. A pool owner, if they wish, could change the account balance on all of their private nodes and there would be no public record of the change or the previous history. Yes this would require collusion of some kind, but even for 10k nodes, such data can be changed in seconds. Without a blockchain, how could anyone prove otherwise?<p>I see the potential for companies like quickbooks, paypal, or even banks, to create public REST interfaces for their account ledgers. This seems inexpensive for a bank to do (compared to a p2p network), and, we&#x27;d have the trust of the bank. This is money after all, so, I&#x27;d trust the bank over a psuedo-private network.<p>Looking forward to see how hyperledger will approach the problems described above.

8012338,comment,8011573,8011573,1,0,wtbob,,,"Trusting Google to certify the world&#x27;s systems hardly seems wise.<p>What _does_ seem wise would be for each certificate to certify multiple independent chains of identity: each certificate should certify hostname, IP address and national identity at a minimum, and possibly also things like BBB status, trade association status &c.<p>How could this work?  Imagine the case of HTTPS at 74.125.227.241 (of of the IPs www.google.com resolves to). My browser would have public keys from the IANA and from the US federal government (and possibly others); it would trust IANA to vouch for IP addresses and DNS, and would trust the US to trust for national identity.<p>The IANA would sign a certificate stating that ARIN are permitted to assign their various blocks of addresses; ARIN would sign a certificate for the block 74.125.227.241 is in themselves, or a middleman if there is one.  Google would sign a certificate for the machines behind 74.125.227.241, stating that they are permitted to use that IP address (wildcards could be used in the probably case that one machine actually responds to more than one IP address).<p>My computer, talking to 74.125.227.241, would receive this certificate chain and can see IANA->ARIN->(middleman)->Google->...->machine, and can verify that there is no spoofing.<p>I think that some of this is theoretically possible with IPsec, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s used anywhere.<p>Meanwhile, IANA would also have signed certificates stating that Verisign are allowed to vouch for holders of .com names.  Verisign could sign a certificate stating that Google are allowed to vouch for holders of google.com names, and Google could sign certificates stating that various subunits are permitted to sign certificates for various subdomains of google.com.  This is similar to the current CA structure, only with the addition of delegation and subdomains, which is really, really key.<p>Because of this, there would be no way for, e.g., INRegistry to vouch for google.com, or any .com, because they only have the right for *.in.<p>Even more important, the holder of each certificate could further subdelegate the authority he received, either in whole (in order hold a secure, ultimately-trusted offline key), or to grant limited privileges to different units.  Thus apps.google.com might be delegated to one group and www.google.com to another.<p>Some of this is done via DNSSEC currently.<p>The US federal government would sign a certificate granting the state of Delaware the ability to vouch for corporations under its jurisdiction; Delaware would sign a certificate stating that &#x27;GOOGLE INC&#x27; is indeed a Delaware corporation.  The US federal government could _also_ sign a certificate for Google, vouching for their tax identification and whatever.<p>The BBB could do the same thing, indicating that the Delaware corporation &#x27;GOOGLE INC&#x27; holds a particular level of recognition.<p>MasterCard could issue a certificate indicating that Google is permitted to charge credit cards for amounts up to whatever.<p>So, the browser trusts IANA to certify DNS names & IP address; it trusts the US government (and possibly others) to certify corporate identities; it trusts the BBB to say nice things about companies; it trusts MasterCard (and others) to say that Google are permitted to receive my credit card info.<p>So the browser bar might show green, because DNS & IP addresses are good; it might show the flags of the US & Delaware, because GOOGLE INC is a Delaware corporation (a foreign subsidiary of Google might show its local nation&#x27;s flag as well); it might show a C- for Google&#x27;s BBB rating; it might show a MasterCard logo, or just a &#x27;$&#x27; or local currency sign.<p>The browser might outright refuse to display a page where IP & DNS authorisations did not exist, and might display warnings on pages with IP & DNS authorisations but lacking legal identities.<p>Of course, in reality each of these entities would probably have an offline key which is what was vouched for; that offline key would then be used on, say, an annual or monthly to certify online secure keys, which might then be used on an hourly basis to certify endpoint keys.<p>You what&#x27;s really cool?  All of the work required to efficiently represent & calculate on (e.g sign & verify not just a single certificate, but an entire chain) the certificates need to do this has already been done, almost 15 years ago.<p>It was a standard called SPKI, and it knocks the current X.509-based XPKI dead. An efficient binary representation; easily-parsed human-readable certificates; trust calculus; it was all there.<p>A lot of folks say that SPKI died because it eliminated the need for CAs, but if you look at all the above there are more, not less authorities; there&#x27;d clearly be a space to market certificate services, to offer insurance &c.  Granted, I don&#x27;t see a lot of room for the current model where a company pays someone to vouch for them, and I trust that voucher, despite there being no relationship of trust between mee and the vouching entity.",1404941401

Using this technique Lean Domain Search is able to check the availability of 5,000 domains in about a second. I wrote about how to get access to the VeriSign zone file here [2]. Parsing it so your app can access it in real time is tricky, but I can go into more detail over email if you want to explore that route.<p>- One thing to think about is whether figuring out the search volume is that important for your users. If it&#x27;s a challenge getting that data from SEMrush or if it&#x27;s slow or if it just clutters up the interface, consider dropping it and focusing on the quality of the suggestions. More information is not necessarily better for users (it depends what problem you are solving and for whom).<p>- If you want to a quick list of prefixes and suffixes to pair the user&#x27;s search term with, I previously analyzed all registered .com&#x27;s to figure out what the most common ones are. That list is available here if you&#x27;re interested [3].<p>- I wound recommend identifying a specific pain point that a specific group of users have that isn&#x27;t addressed well by existing tools and focus all of your efforts on solving that. The more focused you make your app, this better.<p>Props on getting users to tweet about the app to show more suggestions.

As a side note, I don&#x27;t think buying a C-class Mercedes is EVER a good financial decision. The reactions to this article (or that OP experienced in the narrative) are a testament to the success of Mercedes establishing themselves as a luxury brand even though they sell econo-box line vehicles (top post right now puts this pretty well; this is a symbol of wealth, not actually much of an asset).<p>I think the house was a worse decision, as it implies a longer confidence in earning potential; the car could have been paid off much more quickly, and we don&#x27;t really know their earning power at the time of purchase (though I doubt it&#x27;d help the point of them being fiscally responsible).<p>I think a big part of this article is trying to cast an empathetic light on people that end up in tough financial situations BECAUSE of bad financial decision, despite having come from opportunity. When considered clearly, even those impoverished that did not come from opportunity could be saddled with the blame of &#x27;bad financial decisions&#x27;, but just have many more justifications (that are more easily empathized with) for making the decisions they did.<p>At some point or another, though, you are following the same mindset of the &#x27;root beer police&#x27; in the line at the store, written about in the article. You are drawing a line saying &#x27;you purchasing THAT is not responsible&#x27;, and you feel justified in doing so because they are using public help.<p>That&#x27;s sort of the debate at hand here. Is the use of public funds an invitation, or justification, for judgement from others on your consumption? I believe that it is; if you are going to take money from the government, one cost you suffer will be unyielding judgement from others on what you do or do not buy.<p>My point: not selling my old(er) Mercedes in lieu of taking food-stamps while I find another job might ACTUALLY be the best financial decision I can make, for a number of reasons. Whether or not I feel morally reprehensible about this is my own business, really; the assistance programs have their own requirements for eligibility and if I meet them, I meet them. Despite this, it is an invitation for judgement in the cultural climate in which we live, and that&#x27;s just how that is.",1404940045

Once the person attends the event they are given a secret keyword to prove they were actually at the event. Then they go back online and enter the keyword and get points.<p>The idea of the points is to use them to enter contests for prizes and such, hopefully making attending events more enticing.<p>I&#x27;m not so sure the gamification is worth it. If the event is good enough it should warrant attendance based on a persons interest. Anyone have any thoughts on this?",1404940030

China has strengths in some fields, and even if research institutes in China are of lower average quality than their western counterparts, there remain some that are still of high quality. Are you forgetting that Hong Kong is part of China, and has research links to top universities in the Chinese mainland?

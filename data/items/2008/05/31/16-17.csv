205301,comment,205229,205272,0,0,hugh,,,"Well no, asymmetric warfare is any warfare where the two parties differ substantially in strength. In Iraq at the moment, for instance, we're trying to kill the enemy while the enemy doesn't seem to care whether they kill our soldiers or random civilians, but it would remain asymmetric even if the enemy would be so kind as to restrict themselves to trying to kill our soldiers.<p>Unless you're saying that the enemy in Iraq counts as ""civilians"" because they're not part of any proper and recognized army, but that's a rather point-missing definition of ""civilian"", since the defining characteristic of a civilian is whether they're engaging in combat.",1212251625

205295,story,,,2,0,radu_floricica,"Ask HN: Sales strategy for a custom software startup",,"We're 6 month into a custom software startup. The business model is simple: make from scratch a software for a medium company, develop constantly and charge monthly. It worked great for me as a freelancer (and for my customers as well) and I'm trying to scale it together with an investor (former customer who got rich).<p>The technical side is ok, in about 6 month we have a good team and a couple of more apps. Last month we really started to look for new customers, but it goes a lot more slowly then expected. We have two big problems: First is the way we approach a new client - I dislike spam in any way and most things we can try are email/phone/snail mail spam.  Also they don't work very well. The other is the difficulty of explaining the concept. Some like both the idea of custom software and of selling is as a service, but most find them too foreing.<p>Any ideas on future sales strategy?",1212250825

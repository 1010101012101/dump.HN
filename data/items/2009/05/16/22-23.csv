612703,comment,612305,612305,0,0,pj,,,"I would suggest reading about ""Work for Hire"" it's a legal term.  I'm not a lawyer, so don't take what I'm about to say as legal advice, just my personal experience.<p>In my understanding, in general, if you are paid to do it and there is no explicit contract that says the employer owns your work, then you own the work. However, you must look at your contract with your employer.  I am guessing you signed something saying the University owns what you do while you work there, most do. Universities are smart like that.  It may be a sticky issue to say who wrote what and when, so probably best to avoid using your own code at work if you want to retain ownership of it.<p><a href=""http://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22work+for+hire%22"" rel=""nofollow"">http://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22work+for+hire%22</a><p>If I were in your situation, I'd take the opportunity to solve the problem in /another/ way, one that may be better.  Worst case scenario, your brain gets bigger and you can still do things the way you were doing them before you wrote the new way for the university.",1242514588

This was, when I read about it at the time, news to me, and it appears to be news to the person I was responding to.<p>My intuition is that anyone who engages in focused practice of an activity that one can improve in will show similar differences in their brain activity. That is, I think there is a similarity to meditation and what we call ""being in the zone"" for activities as varied as basketball to programming. My personal experience is that such practice is beneficial.",1242514582

That is exactly what I meant.  Whether Erlang satisfies some definition of ""functional"" or ""OO"", or ""concurrency-oriented"" does not matter.  What matters is that it's a kick-ass platform for building scalable distributed fault-tolerant apps.<p>(That said, Erlang is a good introductory language for someone who wants to explore functional programming.)",1242514062

One of the devices can mirror itself to another NAS over the network so you can have two separate places to store your data and not have a hardware failure of one device kill the other.(one exception would be the case where the master device gets degraded to the point where bad data is being written to it and then propagates the changes to the other device.

Especially the global environment.  Economic self-interest is about <i>consume, consume, consume</i> in order to <i>profit profit profit</i>.  It matters not who or what is being ravaged.  Political self-interest at least nudges people to stop, take a deep breath, and look at the effects of such a cycle on an environment.  Political self-interest is perhaps more noble in that it requires one to view onesself in the larger context of his or her community at large.<p>Negative externalities, one of my favorite econ topics, are rarely addressed logically by beings who thrive on the <i>consume consume consume</i> in order to <i>profit profit profit</i> cycle.<p>(<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_externalities"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_externalities</a>)<p>*edited ~ not enough sleep last night!",1242511761

Although it is not without it's bumps.<p>First off I naively went there hoping to get a piece of the action by introducing our web app to local companies. Result? Zilch...too much misunderstanding led to deals that either took way too long to process or have fizzled out.<p>What I discovered though and almost by accident, is that it's the foreign companies who operate there, became our primary customers. Which was a relief cuz I would hate to translate our web app to formal mandarin(actually people on shanghai speak a different kind of mandarin note the distinction.)<p>Xiamen OTOH lacked the hustle and bustle of Shanghai. It seem more laid back and the people and their customs reflect that attitude.

From a logical perspective, since it's information about the link and not meta information about the submission (who submitted it and to what 'category') it made sense to keep it on the link line. More importantly I felt that there was a natural tendency to read the link title and then immediately scan the domain as a final check before one clicks on the link. It felt much more natural to have that as one statement [link] [domain] than to involve scanning to another line [link] -scan-> [domain] even if it was consistently placed on that next line.",1211951234

Banks in Germany would NOT accept greek Euro, or remit non-greeo Euro to a greek bank without collateral or other guarantees. All fiat money is fungible.<p>>> It&#x27;s not. There&#x27;s a point when failing government resorts to actions which go beyond regular taxation -<p>Your statement is ironic. Who gets to define what &quot;regular taxation&quot; is? The US had, at times, 80% taxation. Is that regular? The US government has been running a much higher than reported inflation for years. Is that regular?",1394164633

7358424,comment,7353767,7353767,1,0,InclinedPlane,,,"A few things many coders don&#x27;t worry about enough when it comes to testing:<p>1: Most test code is of lower quality than production code.<p>2: Tests often contain assumptions and those assumptions are usually not checked against any external reference. Whatever is assumed within a test is de facto law. Consider mocks, what ensures that mocks have the same behavior as the objects or services they&#x27;re mocking? Mostly it&#x27;s just an untested assumption.<p>3: By far one of the biggest class of errors in coding is omission. And there tests barely protect you at all. If you forget to implement a particular feature/aspect of code chances are that you&#x27;re going to forget to implement a test for it as well. The way to solve these problems is with thorough code review and integration/beta testing.<p>Ultimately you get into a &quot;who tests the testers?&quot; problem. Which, most of the time, is answered with the resounding noise of crickets. Tests need code review. Tests need owners. Tests need to be challenged. Tests need justifications. A lot of the critical rigor surrounding testing is eroded by common practices which encourage a distinct lack of rigor around test writing (TDD I&#x27;m looking at you). Tests aren&#x27;t magic they&#x27;re just code, they&#x27;ll tell you what you ask but if you&#x27;re not asking the right questions the result is just GIGO.<p>Too many devs think that unit tests are cruise control for quality. They&#x27;re not. Doing testing right should be just as rigorous and just as difficult as implementing features.",1394164232

7358422,comment,7353884,7358057,1,0,colinwinter,,,"^^^Nice way to seize the moment.\nInteresting website concept. Just a suggestion for the homepage: since the top header is so tall, how about moving the play song links from the bottom of each song-artwork to be a universal play symbol (arrow) overtop the artwork, maybe increasing from translucent to full opacity upon hovering, noting contrast issues with relevant artwork. NOTE: at my 1080p pc monitor and font size settings I dont even see the song title &#x27;above the screen&#x27;s fold&#x27;, so you may even want to think about that as well, maybe the same solution as the playbutton using overlay and opacity settings. It is a cool header bg though so dont mess with that, except maybe moving the search box onto it since having it below eats vertical space from the song listings as well.<p>Last point/question: I&#x27;m assuming the $1600 headphone giveaway is for the musicians, not listeners. Good growth tactic but maybe make it more clear OR offer something to listeners as well. I don&#x27;t know much about the song development process market but maybe implement or communicate something about whats expected/gained from listeners for improving the music (assuming you actually want to help musicians rather than eat their souls lol)<p>EDIT: minor ui change to song pages: move everything on the separate login page as an embedded form on song pages (above the comments). No need to ask me to click and hope you&#x27;ve integrated with my favorite 3rd party.<p>EDIT2; Startup based advice: you might want to look into the business model of that site that advertised on thepiratebay using popups autoplaying (fairly decent) music videos of indie artists competing for a prize.

Why don&#x27;t you try learning something about the how the law operates in practice instead of projecting your mechanistic conception onto it? I suggest <i>How Judges Think</i> by Richard Posner, who&#x27;s quite readable and probably the most widely-cited living legal scholar in the US.<p><i>Instead I will walk across everyone&#x27;s property and if the police eventually stop me, I will say I intended to interview the homeowners but changed my mind.</i><p>For example, this might come off as a plausible argument if you walked up a few houses and then turned away, but the plausibility of your argument diminishes in inverse proportion to the number of property lines you cross without acting upon your stated purpose.

7358298,comment,7358150,7358277,12,0,selmnoo,,,"One possibility is indeed that Satoshi is trolling us hard. He may actually have based his pseudonym on this guy... but that&#x27;s playing a dangerous game, as this is in fact one more datapoint to honing in on the real Satoshi.<p>A number of blackhats did this around Lulzsec time. They would adopt a second-level identity -- and drop very, very small hints to make people think they&#x27;re some person X. Person X being a person the blackhat in question just chose randomly by, oh I dono, cruising around the web where people talk about IT security... choosing an interesting person, learning about them by googling around, and eventually starting to play that person (or rather, play that person playing to be anonymous). This was one of the suggested strategies in the helpdocs wiki, advertised on the irc channel where lulzsec members usually would be. But since Dorian is kind of an old guy, the real Satoshi would have had to know him in real life (hence my saying that it&#x27;d be a dangerous game for Satoshi to be playing).<p>But really, I think it&#x27;s just a very funny coincidence. As others have pointed out, Satoshi Nakamoto is not that of an uncommon Japanese name. Too bad Dorian got dragged into all of this. He seems like a sweet old man, with a great sense of humour (&quot;I want a free lunch&quot;, wonderful) and an awesome hobby (model trains are fun). I&#x27;ll buy you a lunch Dorian!",1394161584

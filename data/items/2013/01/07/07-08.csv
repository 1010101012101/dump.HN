The Ars Technica article doesn't mention the Shield at all, just the Tegra 4.<p>Anyway, it sounds like NVidia is putting out a device to show people what the Tegra 4 can do.

They're not expecting to create their own platform: the Shield is just useful for basically acting as a controller for your PC or as a box for playing Android games.<p>There's more to the market than ""hardcore gamers"" (how hardcore can you be using a portable device anyway?)

The massive success of CS50 at Harvard (now one of the top three most popular classes across the entire undergraduate catalog) is both a blessing and a curse: it's great that more students are interested in learning to program, but it's also meant the department is having to rethink what it offers post-CS50.",1357545118

Alternatively if the total load drops, the turbines speed up as they have more mechanical power pushed into them than is being absorbed by the network.<p>You might think it would be easier to droop the Voltage (lower the load), but for a variety of reasons it works out much better to let the frequency drop (e.g. system frequency can be reliably measured over sub-second periods, frequency is the easily measured everywhere on the network independent of phase, simple control systems before there were electronics).<p>The whole network relies on this for control purposes.

Crucially, the text - and its ideas - was shared with others, feedback was gathered, and the text further refined.<p>Low-friction composition is important; it's a huge boost to have a simple clean slate with which to begin. But often once that initial effort is over with, good writing becomes a work of careful refinement. Here's some things I haven't found in any platform that would be great;<p>1. Full revision history. Every keystroke I've made, every tiny little edit should be saved. Everything. In order. Everything. This is a small data problem.<p>2. Once I create some text, I'd like to be able to share it privately with my trusted testers and feedbackers. They should be able to highlight text and make notes in-place. If I trust them enough - or they are an actual nominated human editor - they should be able to edit the text.<p>3. Some guidelines for good clear writing are automatable. An editor could tell me when a sentence is getting very long. An editor could detect obscure or imprecise words and suggest alternatives. An editor could detect repetition of mundane words or phrases. You get the idea ... the point is that real work can be done here.<p>4. It would be nice to be able to make margin notes, and to track goals. It is common to sketch out in advance the purpose or goals of a text; the outline and key points to be included. It'd be neat to be able to check them off as progress is made.<p>Or in summary; it'd be nice to see a tool that took as its goal that writing itself can be made more effective, rather than merely prettier.",1357543853

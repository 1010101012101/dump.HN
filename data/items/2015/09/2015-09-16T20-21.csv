When the FLIGHT ATTENDANT looked at my chemistry set, she turned to another official and said: &quot;He could make a bomb out of these chemicals&quot;, My first reaction was to laugh.<p>I waited a minute while the adults thought it over and said: &quot;I&#x27;m 10, I don&#x27;t know how to make a bomb or anything.

And I agree that we&#x27;re witnessing it unfold with antibiotic resistance and the like.<p>But what I am saying is that physics has a lot more rigor for the claims by virtue of how it works, and what people are looking for there.  Evolution is punctuated equilibrium and human beings haven&#x27;t directly witnessed this to the same degree that people have in physics.<p>I think the direct witnessing aspect is important, even if others may disagree.  The reason I think it&#x27;s important is that there are other <i>possible</i> though <i>highly improbable</i> explanations for various physical phenomena we see on earth.<p>If there really was a &quot;guy in the sky&quot; he could have absolutely made a bunch of stuff and &quot;planted the evidence&quot; all over the place to fool people.  But if also for some reason, he always handled the laws of physics just the way things are now, we wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell the difference.<p>To me it&#x27;s kind of like the people who suggest that we should try and see if reality is just a simulation being run in a computer.

The group was only accessible by JPL employees.  The express purpose was so that employees could state their views freely without fear of reprisals.<p>It was an unmitigated disaster.

Then the smart programmers leave and who is left cannot handle the code and new hires take too long to get into it. Then funding runs out and the apparent lack of progress ensures that nobody wants to put more money into the company.<p>> Literate programming is an interesting idea from academia, but in the engineering environment of most startups it&#x27;s a waste of time.<p>Amazingly, we&#x27;re actually getting back to something that resembles literate programming - via TDD. Instead of asking for a proper spec, we now ask for test definitions that the code must pass. Those can even be written in something that is pretty close to natural language (cucumber etc) so that management can write them. Then we spend time to make the test framework understand all those pseudo-natural-language test definitions and then we finally write the code. Is that really faster? Or are we just missing the tools that would allow us to tie a natural language specification to code?",1442436009

There is absolutely more support and better programs for homeless women than for homeless men. However, that is partly because there are a lot fewer women on the street than men, by a very wide margin. Which means that programs for homeless women serve a substantially smaller population, thus it is easier to provide something higher quality.<p>Part of why so few women are on the street: Family often makes sure a woman with small kids is not literally out on the street. She may not be welcome, but her kids are, and this gives her a place to stay, even if she is treated like crap -- for the sake of the kids. Furthermore, women on the street are at fairly high risk of being raped, something men on the street are not at risk of. So a lot of women will do whatever they have to do to avoid being on the street -- even if that means shacking up with some guy as a polite form of prostitution (an offer I turned down but have seen at least one other homeless woman accept).<p>My opinion as someone who has both studied it formally and lived it firsthand, and thus interacted with plenty of actual homeless people and observed them, is that men on the street tend to be in less desperate straits than women on the street. Fewer women end up on the street, for complex reasons which do not really translate to privilege per se. There are ways in which me being on the street is an exercise of agency that many women are denied.<p>Your complaint is kind of like saying &quot;Cancer patients get the best surgeries!&quot; It isn&#x27;t exactly something to be envious of.<p>I do wish homeless services generally were better, mostly from a perspective of treating homeless individuals with actual respect, regardless of their gender. But complaining that homeless women have some kind of privilege is basically an ignorant statement.<p>As for your actual original comment about <i>women&#x27;s shelters</i>: They exist as sanctuary for women who have been abused. A common way women end up on the street is they flee an abusive relationship where they are financially dependent upon the man. Thus, they flee for their lives with little more than the clothes on their backs. Although there are men who are victims of domestic violence, this is a much more common problem for women, both from the perspective of being assaulted and from the perspective of being financially dependent and, thus, finding it logistically difficult to leave. We don&#x27;t have &quot;men&#x27;s shelters&quot; in part because there is relatively little demand for sanctuary for abused and penniless men compared to the demand you see in the female population.<p>/public service announcement",1442435662

There&#x27;s going to be a bid/ask spread on that because of the cost of accepting money and bundling it together, along with the cost of keeping up with the book-keeping and various other things that are costs for loans.  So the rate you get paid in interest should always be less than the rate that you pay in interest.  This I understand.<p>But if the interest rate is low, then the interest rate is low.  The interest rate is determined by the aggregate supply and demand for money.  If there is a lot of supply, relative to demand, then the interest rate is low.  If there is a lot of demand relative to supply, then the rate is high.  And given that people have a nearly infinite desire for money today versus in the future, the rate is really determined by the supply.<p>The Fed is in control of the supply by creating or destroying money as needed.  That means that they fully and truly do set the rate, because they can do literally whatever is needed to move the needle.<p>The idea that everyone&#x27;s individual actions to save is somehow what created the tremendous amount of expansion in the money supply (and thus the very low interest rate) is utter nonsense.

I wouldn&#x27;t even be surprised once Rust settles down further it turns out there&#x27;s some sort of hybrid solution that is better than either 1:1 or M:N on its own because it has superior insight into what its functions are doing.<p>However, if you are sitting down in front of an editor, faced with the task of writing a network server, and you immediately reach for the overcomplicated solutions like this rather than starting with threads, you are paying an awfully stiff development price for a performance improvement that probably won&#x27;t even manifest as any useful effect, because the window where this will actually save you is rather small. If you&#x27;re sitting at 90% utilization, and this sort of tweak can get you to 80% utilization, that&#x27;s essentially a no-op in the network server space, because it means you still better deploy a second server either way. If you&#x27;re close to a capacity problem (and the code has been decently optimized to the point where that&#x27;s not an option anymore), the solution is not to rewrite your code to squeeze out the 10% inefficiency in stack handling, the solution is to deploy another server, and if a rewrite is needed, rewrite to make that possible/effective/practical.<p>In the Servo design space, it makes perfect sense to be upset that you lost 10% of your performance to green threads, because that&#x27;s time a real human user is directly waiting, and what does a web browser need with 10,000 threads anyhow? (I mean, sure, set one the deliberate task of using that many threads and they can, but in practice you&#x27;d rather be doing real work than <i>any</i> sort of scheduling of that mess.)

A traditional Keynesian interest rate channel whereby the Fed purchases long-term bonds in order to reduce the long-term interest rates as it is unable to further reduce short term rates (zero lower bound)<p>2. The Tobin’s q channel whereby some of the liquidity is directed to the stock market, increasing stock prices and investment in turn<p>3. A wealth effect that increases consumption brought about by higher bond and equity prices<p>4. Expected inflation brings forward consumption and investment spending as households and firms purchase in the present rather than in the future when money is expected to lose real purchasing power (increased velocity of money due to inflation)<p>5. Increased net exports whereby some of the liquidity is used to purchase foreign reserves, decreasing the exchange rate and devaluing the dollar<p>I&#x27;ll leave it up to you to research whether or not these 5 channels have been effectively manipulated as Keynesians would have predicted through QE. But I have a feeling you already know the answer...Bonus points if you can answer this question: Why did channel #2 work so well, and why haven&#x27;t we seen the supposed wealth effect (#3) predicted under a burgeoning stock market?",1442435031

The total of an economy&#x27;s currency represents the total value within that economy; think a pie, where the number of slices is the currency representation of the totality of the pie. If the money supply does not increase as the economy grows, then each currency unit effectively stretches to represent more value: as the pie gets bigger, but the number of slices doesn&#x27;t change, then the value imputed to each slice grows. If the money supply grows but the economy doesn&#x27;t, the value of each currency unit decreases: the number of slices increases, but the amount of pie per slice decreases. If the currency supply increases on par with the economic growth, the value per unit remains the same while the total value of the economy increases: as the pie grows, you want to increase the number of slices so that each slice has the same amount of pie, even though there is more pie total.<p>When inflation exceeds growth, people get distressed as their &quot;slice of the pie&quot; gets smaller. When growth exceeds supply, people get distressed as it gets harder to obtain a slice of that pie.

I&#x27;m not sure how reliable their numbers are (again: they&#x27;re a foundation with an agenda), but if you read through their own spin, you can see that the big tax-based black market for cigarettes exists where there&#x27;s a state-border disparity in tax rates, and even then, in 48 states the (estimated) black market took up less than half of the actual market.<p>So: set taxes at whatever arbitrary level, but don&#x27;t go too high. Also, consider setting national tax rates instead. So many of our problems derive from state-level control of stuff. Delaware corporations, state taxes, state laws.

I happen to also do technology stuff, so in addition to being deeply engaged with this content, I develop software and hang around on hacker news. Anyway.<p>The point is: (as dragonwriter mentioned), the student rarely makes this decision. Furthermore, even when the student does, or when the parents of the students do, the decisions that are being made are pretty heftily influenced by advertising, gut instinct, and in-general wrong thinking about education. Take, for example, the weird and broad anti-common-core movement. Parents don&#x27;t want their kids <i>thinking</i> about mathematics, they want their kids memorizing math facts just like they did when they were in school. Parents are swayed by images of tons of technology being used in these charters, when it turns out that most schools don&#x27;t use tech all that effectively (they just reproduce old behaviorist models of instruction in an attempt to automatize teaching - recreate the teaching machine as Audrey Watters puts it).<p>In fact, the recent OECD report about use of technology in classrooms around the world was just making news earlier this week: in schools where there&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of 1:1 use of computers, students actually fare more poorly. This isn&#x27;t surprising to me, or anyone else who studies education and the school systems, because of the point above: those computers aren&#x27;t being used to improve or extend interactive learning, they&#x27;re being used to deliver memorization-based, fact-and-repeat instruction. That&#x27;s the same kind of boring teaching that turned off generations of kids in the past, and we&#x27;re reproducing it again in classrooms with computers. However, those classrooms are shiny, filled with young, idealistic, often very poorly-prepared teachers and are very photogenic to parents.<p>Even worse- the charter movement (broadly speaking) has subverted most of the assessment process by ensuring that what is tested is the most flat, boring, and fact-based material around. (This is, incidentally, my own objection to common core- not the standards, but the terribad implementation of those standards in untested and regressive assessments). The assessments are bad, tend to not measure good learning, and instead measure a student&#x27;s ability to memorize and repeat factual information. When charter schools do well on that front, and when the pro-charter movement gets the entire narrative framed in terms of &quot;bloated, failing public schools&quot;, it is not surprising that parents (and grandparents, and students, and so on) are generally mislead by this narrative. It&#x27;s not surprising that people choose charter schools.<p>People choose to give their money to University of Phoenix, which is objectively a terrible idea. Marketing works. Shiny pictures of happy kids with laptops learning the basics works to motivate people. The truth is, good education is complex - not even complicated, but complex - and asking the general public to really grok the nuances of it is difficult, especially since everyone has their own experience of what worked for them and things were good enough for me when I was in school, darn it.<p>A brief aside: there are plenty of good charter schools and charter networks, which are striving to bring high-quality reform-oriented education to everyone, especially underserved minorities. However, these charters aren&#x27;t the ones I&#x27;m talking about. There are plenty more that take district dollars and provide sub-par education, and somehow manage to keep either getting renewed or just change names every three years when they come up for re-accreditation. There&#x27;s also plenty of poorly-performing public schools and districts. Teachers&#x27; Unions aren&#x27;t a panacea.<p>Ultimately, the problem from top to bottom is that our school system is in the hands of people who don&#x27;t actually know much about education. Many board of education positions (especially state levels, which exert a lot of control) are political appointments or elected positions. How many times do you read about stupid stuff some board of ed is doing - rewriting history or requiring creationism or other crapola? Education is complex and nuanced, and people seem to engage in the discussion thinking that there&#x27;s a Simple Fix for everything.<p>Charters are just vouchers in disguise, and vouchers are just saying &quot;let the Free Market fix it&quot;, because the Free Market is super-great at fixing things like the banking, energy, health care, and housing systems in the US. Other charters have &quot;let&#x27;s let Technology fix it&quot; ideas or &quot;we&#x27;re super-rigorous, require dress codes, and provide Discipline by calling all our students Mr. and Miss Lastname instead of having real relationships with our students&quot;. There&#x27;s dozens of silly simple fixes floating around.<p>And you want parents to navigate all of this? It may be arrogant of me to say it, but I honestly don&#x27;t think most parents can parse through all the crap. Again, people are still paying money to University of Phoenix, people buy guns thinking it will make them safer, and do dozens of other things that are just plain foolish because people aren&#x27;t experts in everything. If you could assume that someone had enough understanding of how people learn (at least having read the book... How People Learn, which is still a great primer), you could maybe assume they&#x27;re going to make good decisions. But this is a decision that (as you point out) will stick with the kid for 13 years proximally, and influence their opportunities for the rest of their life.<p>We should regulate this market.",1442433840

If threads work fine, use them! That&#x27;s what most Rust network apps do, and they work fine and run fast. A modern Linux kernel is very good at making 1:1 threading fast these days.<p>> And having written network servers with pretty much every abstraction so much as mentioned in the article, green threads are a dream for writing network servers.<p>Green threads didn&#x27;t provide performance benefits over native threads in Rust. That&#x27;s why they were removed.<p>Based on my experience, goroutine-style green threads don&#x27;t really provide an performance benefit over native threads. The overhead that really matters for threads is in stack management, not the syscalls, and M:N threading has a ton of practical disadvantages (which is why Java removed it, for example). It&#x27;s worth going back to the debate around the time of NPTL and look at what the conclusions of the Linux community were around this time (which were, essentially, that 1:1 is the way to go and M:N is not worth it).<p>There <i>are</i> benefits to be had with goroutine-style threads in stack management. For example, if you have a GC that can relocate pointers, then you can start with small stacks. But note that this is a property of the stack, not the scheduler, and you could theoretically do the same with 1:1 threading. It also doesn&#x27;t get you to the same level of performance as something like nginx, which forgoes the stack entirely.<p>If you really want to eliminate the overhead and go as fast as possible, you need to get rid of not only the syscall overhead but also the stack overhead. Eliminating the stack means that there is no &quot;simple&quot; solution at the runtime level: your compiler has to be heavily involved. (Look at async/await in C# for an example of one way to do this.) This is the approach that I&#x27;m most keen on for Rust, given Rust&#x27;s focus on achieving maximum performance. To that end, I really like the &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach that the Rust community is taking: let&#x27;s get the infrastructure working first as libraries, and then we&#x27;ll figure out how to make it as ergonomic as possible, possibly (probably?) with language extensions.<p>My overarching point is this: it&#x27;s very tempting to just say &quot;I/O is a solved problem, just use green threads&quot;. But it&#x27;s not that simple. M:N is obviously a viable approach, but it leaves a lot of performance on the table by keeping around stacks and comes with a lot of disadvantages (slow FFI, for example, and fairness).",1442433811

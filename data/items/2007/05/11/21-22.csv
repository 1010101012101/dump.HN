21459,comment,21377,21456,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"Um, when was the last time someone in the US was thrown in prison and/or executed for a political opinion?  This happens in China right now, and there are already several cases where they used Google and Yahoo information to do it.  Hence the very justified outcry against a US company directly aiding such an evil Government.",1178920075
21458,comment,21316,21421,0,0,randallsquared,,,"There are a number of problems with it.  First, it won't actually affect spammers unless nearly everyone is using it... what could force them to accept the charges?  Second, it's turned out that even the email systems that ask people to confirm they sent something (which spambots can't understand in general) are too much for many people to bother with, so asking them to join a system in order to pay a fraction of a cent for each email they write would likely be too much trouble.<p>Lastly, spam filters actually work really well.  I get roughly a thousand spams a day to my primary address which has been continuously in use for ~7 years, and have to ""mark as junk"" maybe two spams a day -- the rest go straight to my  junk folder.",1178920045
21457,comment,21377,21453,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"A censored google targeting political activists does nothing good for the oppressed people.  It only makes ad revenues for Google while helping the opressing government pull the wool over their subject's eyes and jail and/or kill their political enemies.",1178920001

I've already used it in 3 different projects and IMHO this is the best web framework for Java. The community is very active, and it's leaded by Gavin King (from Hibernate fame).<p>Apparently Seam supports Groovy now (I haven't tried it yet, but it looks promising):<p><a href=""http://blog.hibernate.org/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/2007/05/07"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.hibernate.org/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/2007/05/07</a>\n",1178919675
21453,comment,21377,21377,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"If I were Larry/Sergei/Schmidt, I'd vote against it too, just because I get annoyed when random shareholders try to tell me what to do with my company. When I first read this in a different context, it was worded so that the shareholders who weren't otherwise involved in the company brought up this proposal to force the company to do this stuff. IMO, even if I were going to follow the general intent of the proposal, I wouldn't want these random people who bought a bunch of stock to start snooping over my shoulder all the time. <p>Furthermore, the measure seems likely to prevent the governments of said countries from allowing Google into them at all. It is debatable whether having a censored Google or no Google is better for oppressed peoples. ",1178919543

I see no possible excuse for this.  They are providing the most efficient and effective censorship and political targeting software ever created.",1178919403
21451,comment,21316,21448,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"Let's not make it binary. There are unsolicited commercial messages that we like; there are unsolicited noncommercial messages that we hate, and there are messages we wish we hadn't solicited -- I think filters should help us exclude email that isn't worth our time to read, and let us read the email that is (in fact, rather than a filter I'd hope we could some day have a 'prioritizer' that gave us interesting, critical stuff first and that deleted less meaningful messages if we ignored them long enough).<p>Your SEO example illustrates what I'm talking about: it may be one of those offers that is worth the time it takes to consider it, so you'd hope that a spam filter wouldn't bounce it. On the other hand, I dislike SEO and worry that the users I'd get from it are lower-quality, so I wouldn't want to bother. This is why Bayesian filters can (and should) be somewhat personalized. An invitation to a conference might look like spam to 99.9% of people, but that other .10% shouldn't be punished for having strong but unconventional preferences.",1178919287

Almost all submissions are positive, so nevermind. People with mostly negative submissions are probably spammers anyway. ",1178919165

I'm trying to understand what is spam, because unless we understand that we won't be able to stop it.<p>Let's say you got a message that offers SEO optimization for your web site, and you are not a SEO expert. The message has a decent business writing style, there's a signature with a decent-looking contact information with an postal address, email and everything. And the message invites you to click on a link. Is it spam or not?",1178918816

21443,comment,21316,21438,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"Are you confusing gross and net use? Spammers value responses, and they can maximize those by either a) sending more spam, or b) getting more readers per message. I suspect that a) is finally becoming prohibitive because every new message trains all the Bayesian filters out there -- so it might work better for them to have fewer, weirder spams. And why just inject randomness into your message when you can inject usable order?<p>The kind of people who read spam now are the kind of people who mass-forward jokes, so I can imagine a savvy spammer <i>hiring comedians to write topical jokes, and appending a Viagra ad to end</i>. They can 'beat' Bayesian filters by wrapping their spam in a message people will actually read and possibly forward.",1178917810

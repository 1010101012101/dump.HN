The low-end 13"" MacBook Air has a 1.7Ghz dual-core i5 processor, 4GB RAM, a 128GB SSD, and a Thunderbolt port providing two bidirectional 10Gb/s channels.<p>From what I can find, an IBM S/390 from the early 1990s could have up to 6 processors and 6 vector coprocessors, up to 9GB of internal storage, and up to 256 fiber-optic links running at 10MB/s (for an total bandwidth of a Thunderbolt port plus a USB 2.0 port).<p>I don't really know how fast the CPU and RAM were in the IBM mainframe, but I'd suspect the Air's clock speeds are high enough to make up for only having two processors, and the Air's SSD would make it much faster for data sets that don't fit in RAM.<p>And as for the reliability advantage a mainframe is supposed to have: you could buy several MBAs per month to act as hot-spares for the price of renting the mainframe, and the MBA has a UPS built-in.",1316036049

The Louvre has an admission fee which is absolutely trivial considering the treasurs within; it makes no sense to quibble over it, not matter what the money goes to. Likewise having to watch TV adverts or spend a few pounds to see a masterpiece like On The Waterfront, is not something worth complaining about. Secondly, the issue was not that big studios are willing to make bad movies, it's that currently they're also willing to make riskier, less formulaic movies too. That could easily change if movies had little shelf life for future profits.<p>And to answer your question, I'm perfectly okay with not owning Mickey Mouse.

Did you? No. Even assuming that those other companies had an insignificant share of the market, and could safely be ignored, you still could have asked for public commentary on your design, like you're asking Google to do now. Did you? No again. It's hypocritical to blast Google for doing the exact same things you did, for the exact same reasons.<p>Secondly, every attempt to create a ""programming language for non-programmers"" has resulted in something horrible. According to wikipedia, ""one of the design goals of COBOL was that non-programmers—managers, supervisors, and users—could read and understand the code. This is why COBOL has an English-like syntax and structural elements."" When you are comparing your language design decisions to those made by COBOL, it is time to give up.<p>Your own stated rationale for getting Javascript done in 10 days was to ""prevent something worse"" from happening. This is the exact same reason why Google is developing Dart. The only difference is that for them, ""something worse"" is Microsoft Silverlight, Adobe Flash, and Apple iPhone applications.<p>Right now, if I want an application that ""feels native,"" Javascript is a no-go, and I have to use one of these (closed, proprietary) technologies. Shouldn't we be saluting Google for trying to make the situation better, rather than blasting them for not asking their competitors for a mother-may-I?<p>Dart is going to be an open platform that is well-supported by Chrome and Android. That alone should be enough to make it a viable choice. It's great that you created Javascript and that it became an open platform for everyone. Now someone is trying to build something even better.

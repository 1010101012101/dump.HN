Drug adherence, comparative effectiveness, utilization review, all make good sales pitch, but PBMs ultimately profit more from higher drug utilization, narrow-network, generics, formulary, rebate, and home delivery.  PBMs just have to pretend they&#x27;re managing cost effectively on behalf of payors.<p>He basically needs to convince the payors (ie customers of insurance companies) that this will improve adherence, resulting in lower costs.  Large health plans such as UHG, Aetna, just like PBMs, make money off of sicker people and higher utilization on the long run.  Anything that improves health is existential threat to them.<p>He will need to partner up with boutique PBMs or insurance companies for trial runs and prove its effectiveness, and scale up.  Perhaps start with specialty meds.<p>Ultimate goal is to get the largest payor involved (Medicaid and Medicare) and get their backing.  They have the most to gain from this.<p>Another problem he faces is this: Mail-order PBMs already have sophisticated automatic dispensing facilities.  Yes, much of their machines are designed to fill white pill-bottles, but it won&#x27;t take that much investment to make daily packs like this, and do it at lower labor cost and higher accuracy.",1429235995

So rather than Senior Dev positions I&#x27;d recommend looking for: CTO, Chief Architect, VP of Eng, or even PM.<p>The one element you seem to be missing in your ideal-job-description is the management aspect. In my experience: as your role abstracts away from the day-to-day coding it typically onloads quite a bit of oversight duties.

Specifically the document investigates &quot;EASTL&quot;, i.e. the Electronic Arts STL, and how its learnings can be applied to the common STL.<p>The actual title: &quot;Towards improved support for games, graphics, real-time, low latency, embedded systems.&quot;<p>These little pieces of censorship—that&#x27;s not a sign that for some reason, we really don&#x27;t like to talk about games. There&#x27;s no pervasive second-class-citizenry attitude towards gaming. I don&#x27;t really know how to interpret the omission, other than it&#x27;s a little piece of little consequence.<p>Gaming keeps surfacing in places big and small as a motivation behind some technical or business innovation. Here we get very real improvements to the STL. This certainly matters: we celebrate Quake&#x27;s square-root estimation trick as a cultural artifact, evidence of the beauty of programming. Elsewhere, in recent news, we hear Stewart Butterfield&#x27;s narrative, which was as much about Flickr and Slack as it is about his twice-failed game concept. Lots of ideas and characters in the tech world have touched gaming in one way or another.<p>In my personal background at my startup, I keep running into folks pushed out of gaming. They start making &quot;apps.&quot; Surrounded by app people, I might miss that a third of all new apps in the App Store are actually games[0]. Even then, games are disproportionately represented in Apple Design Awards. It&#x27;s tough to get an accurate figure we&#x27;d all agree on, but I believe games are nonetheless also overrepresented in revenue (definitely from the looks of top grossing, if we&#x27;re strictly speaking about mobile software).<p>If we really want to talk about software, I&#x27;d expect 1/3 to 1/2 of the content on the front page to actually be about games.

But that&#x27;s not that many people, which is why the U.S. military started having recruiting problems after they launched the Iraq and Afghanistan wars: many people who had previously signed up now regretted it, and the supply of new volunteers dwindled.<p>My own experience with classmates is quite different, but it sounds like it&#x27;s a few years prior, so it might already be out of date. Around when my friends and I graduated high school (~1999-2000) the military was seen as a reasonable career path with a primarily deterrent and strategic role, and a fairly low chance of offensive deployment. And the reserves were seen as a last-ditch force that would effectively only be called up if the U.S. or a NATO ally were invaded. Many of my classmates who entered around then signed on for this mission, and didn&#x27;t agree with subsequent decisions made by the political branches to change their role. The &quot;stop-loss orders&quot; of 2002–03, in which they were not allowed to discharge at their originally agreed discharge date, and the calling up of the reserves for something that did not really fit the prior understanding of how reserves would be used (both done as desperate measures to make up for volunteer numbers absolutely tanking), were particularly unpopular, and at that point many no longer felt like they were still volunteers. I feel myself like I dodged a bullet by not going that path (I had talked to a recruiter in 1999, who painted a fairly appealing story about technical careers in the military).",1429234704

This was the state of play just prior to the Docker 1.6 announcement:<p>- Docker registry, the old pre-2.0 version: I hate it. It&#x27;s incredibly slow, and it raises lots of errors.<p>- Docker 1.5: Mostly stable and usable if you&#x27;re on the right kernel, occasionally does something weird.<p>- docker-machine (from git): Very nice for provisioning basic docker hosts locally or on AWS. Nice feature: it&#x27;s capable of automatically regenerating TLS certificates when Elastic IP addresses get remapped.<p>- docker-compose 1.1.0: Kind of a toy, but a fun toy, and it generally did what it advertised.<p>- docker swarm: With docker-compose 1.1.0 and docker 1.5, it was pretty much unusable. Simply running &quot;docker-compose up -d&quot; twice in a row was enough to make it fail with random errors.<p>I&#x27;m going to re-evaluate swarm with docker 1.6 and the new docker-compose.",1429232710

The AppStore is a shitty retail pipeline; 30% is a crazy commission for digital software distribution, the single-retailer-monopoly + appstore design is driving prices to unsustainable levels, etc.",1429232701

about 9:10<p>&quot;virtual machines and garbage collection which when java first appeared were still ridiculous concepts&quot;<p>So I&#x27;m listening to a guy&#x27;s thoughts on programming languages who apparently never heard of lisp and is seemingly unaware of Guy Steele.<p>&quot;Our time is much better spent using a high level language...&quot;
Which is a sweepingly generalisation for which the exceptions, nuances and caveats are very clear to most reading Hacker News.<p>I&#x27;m stopping now. That&#x27;s 10 minutes of my life I&#x27;m not getting back. If someone thinks this promotes scala please think again, it probably has the opposite effect. If someone was kind enough to point out where the non-ridiculous content actually starts and provide some summary of why it might be worth anyone&#x27;s time I&#x27;d have another look but I think I&#x27;ll be looking for thoughts on scala elsewhere. Signal to noise far too low for me here. YMMV.<p>As an aside, promoting a wider popularity for a skill set you already have is usually a good idea professionally. Ask any Perl expert. This is probably has something to do with the vitriol in the &quot;programming language wars.&quot; It&#x27;s nothing new, Dick Gabriel described C as &quot;a virus.&quot; Many C++ promoters hate on C reflexively even when they&#x27;re right. Many Java&#x27;s hate on C++, Pythonistas on Perl, Haskell on Scala etc etc. Choose life.",1429232623

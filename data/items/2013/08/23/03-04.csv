Now the NSA probably has record on close to 100% of the US population.<p>* The US used to believe in the idea that everyone had to obey the law and especially the constitution.

Preventing such things is the entire reason we have a criminal justice system. Within the legal system we have all of these procedures and rights and so forth that have been carefully honed over centuries to ensure that the system is fair and not abusive. Except here we have this bizarre little bubble that is effectively outside the criminal justice system for most intents and purposes which has about the effect one would imagine in such situations.<p>The detained here has no benefit of counsel, no ability to see the evidence put against them, no presumption of innocence, and so forth. And we can see within this one little example a microcosm of why all of those things are necessary and what happens when they are absent.<p>No matter how you cut it this individual was effectively punished, the fact that there are almost no safeguards to prevent such abuses of power today should be chilling to everyone.<p>&quot;Setting off an explosion detector&quot; is not the most important part of this. Imagine the detector as a human being instead (explosives detectors are just as fallible) making an accusation against someone. An accusation is not a conviction.

I would finish lunch, and instead of being pumped up and ready to go on whatever it was, I would just stare at the screen and my mental performance/motivation would drop big time. It got so bad that I turned to Adderall XR (concentrated amphetamine salts prescribed by my doctor for what I explained as &quot;post-lunch narcolepsy&quot;) to try to make things better. It was great because I could literally do anything I put my mind to, but over time, I noticed it would leave me feeling soul-less and hollow inside for lack of a better term. I was as if I was trading in my entire personality, just to be able to get work done. So I started experimenting with some other things less crazy things. I noticed coffee with lunch kind of helped, but it would get me too excited and it left me anxious because it didn&#x27;t have any inhibitory neurotransmitters to calm me down/doesn&#x27;t replenish what it took out of me. So I added a little bit of GABA (an inhibitory neurotransmitter) to prolong a more balanced effect. But then I still had that sugar spike that would make me tired, so I researched a whole bunch of other things that would aid in metabolism and energy production. I finally found a combination that actually worked, but the problem was that I had to take a bunch of pills and none of the supplements I found online were in the right doses/proportions, so I would literally have to spend hours each month packing powder from my milligram scale into tiny capsules that I could take with my lunch. That process sucked big time, so I started giving it to some of my friends to see if they wanted to do a larger production run, and they were all big fans so we all looked into getting the capsules manufactured with some of the nutraceutical companies in New York...long story short, we came up with a name (Alleradd) and a website (<a href=""http://www.alleradd.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alleradd.com</a>) and we&#x27;re doing a limited launch to a few people right now. I&#x27;d love to send you a bottle and see if you like it. So far, the response has been overwhelmingly positive and people are coming up with all sorts of other interesting uses for it. As for me, I still just use it every day with lunch and it feels great/restores my motivation. Anyway, that&#x27;s it for my rant.<p>Cheers,<p>s1mple",1377227777

Gold, like all other goods should be free to have a value that is intrinsic to its uses (of which there are many in science and engineering) and other goods should not be subject to price fluctuations due to supply and demand issues related to gold.<p>Obviously, people have issues with their fiat currency issuer  especially since currencies tend to be a government monopoly and lots of governments abuse that monopoly. However, that&#x27;s well outside the point I was making. In any case, that&#x27;s not an issue with fiat currency per se but with government monopolies on fiat currency (something that currencies like Bitcoin have set out to address).",1377226830

10773845,comment,10771031,10771031,0,0,kazinator,,,"> <i>In Lisp a procedure tends to accept many options which configure its behaviour. This is known as monolithism, or to make procedures like a kitchen-sink, or a Swiss-army knife.</i><p>This is the case in some areas of the Common Lisp language; it is not true of the Lisp, as a family of dialects.<p>There are plenty of examples of Lisp functions or operators that just do one thing: `cons`, `car`, the `lambda` macro operator.<p><pre><code>   ;; CL\n   (remove-if-not #&#x27;p xs :count 5 :start 3)\n\n   ;; Haskell\n   take 5 . filter p . drop 3\n\n   ;; TXR Lisp: a dialect with ties to CL:\n   (take 5 [keep-if p (drop 3 list)])\n\n   ;; Compose the functions using opip macro\n   ;; (result is a function object):\n   (opip (drop 3) (keep-if p) (take 5))\n</code></pre>\nTXR Lisp&#x27;s library functions don&#x27;t have the :count, :start and whatnot. In fact, there are no keyword parameters, only optionals. If you want to default an optional on the left and specify a value of one on the right, you can pass the colon keyword to explicitly default:<p><pre><code>   (defun opt (a : (b 1) (c 2)) ;; two optional args\n     )\n\n   (opt 4 : 5)  ;; b takes 1, c takes 5.\n</code></pre>\nThe colon is just the symbol whose name is the empty string &quot;&quot;, in the keyword package. It makes for nice sugar and has a couple of uses in the language. Note how in the defun it separates required args from optionals.<p>(Anyone else cringe at &quot;UNIX philosophy&quot;; how silly! This is the Unix philosophy: let&#x27;s reduce everything to a string in between processing stages and parse it all over again, with simplifying assumptions that it always has exactly the format we are looking for without actually validating it.)",1450735151

Eventually everything else you use will require newer Rails and upgrading at that point becomes extraordinarily difficult. E.g., ActiveRecord plugins often just monkeypatch the internals, which are naturally free to change from release to release.

It may seem bizarre to us now but, prior to that, students having a college education was viewed as being beneficial to society first and to the student second. And the funding model where states paid for almost everything followed from that.<p>But once you make the mental leap from it being about a public good to it being about an individual good, the arbitrage starts, just as it does for any item where the cost is significantly below its value.

If it&#x27;s a chore, then forcing <i>that kid</i> to do it because of some arbitrary standard applied to all kids might end up being a net negative.  The gains from being able to read and write earlier might be outweighed by increased negative feelings associated with learning and teachers and school.

That steps on some ethical toes as well. While it&#x27;s gotten much better, there is still a great deal of culture, advertising, parenting, etc that can subconsciously influence gender roles. Although it looks as though you can only influence people so much, at innate genetic/biologic nature seems to want to resist.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s an answer to it either, but to me it looks like while biology and genetics do have some sway, so does environment and culture- enough where the current gender percentages probably shouldn&#x27;t be quite so divergent.

This offset can be &quot;dereferenced&quot; with respect to objects of different types in the same hierarchy, taking into account multiple inheritance and virtual bases, etc. A pointer to a Base::Foo function, can be applied against a Derived object, such that it resolves to the correct code, even though Base is the third base of Derived, and so Foo is in a totally different vtable position in Derived compared to Foo. (The pointer cannot be a blind integer offset.)<p>In C, we would make a struct containing function pointers, and a simple &quot;pointer to member&quot; would just be an integer &quot;offsetof(our_struct_type, some_function)&quot;.

The main casualty would be the reason why this is being discussed at all: compilers need to make very specific assumptions on UB to enable some optimizations and if UB goes away, so do the optimizations. So we get the performance of the &quot;boring&quot; compiler anyway, just with more effort on behalf of the programmer.<p>DJB is (as always, I guess) right, C simply isn&#x27;t really suited to optimizations based on UB. What&#x27;d be the big deal if compiler developers just stopped inflicting these on C programmers and focused on optimizing compilers for better-defined languages (with range types, specified overflow behavior etc.) instead?",1450733392

I was disappointed in some of the closed-mindedness that some of the &quot;experts&quot; seemed to have, although they may have been correct about some of the research being on shaky ground in terms of proof. A lot of research offers up correlations and anecdotal observations, but no actual scientific proof. However if you find a lot of anecdotal correlations pointing in the same direction it&#x27;s begs for scientific study to see if there is proof or mere coincidence. Sadly many of those scientists didn&#x27;t seem the least bit curious to find out if there was any scientific cause behind anecdotal evidence, especially if it conflicted with their political views. That was so disappointing! I would have expected a much different attitude from scientists and experts. But if political opinion is what funds research and determines which scientists get promoted, I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t be quite so shocked.

Moreover, it is not immediately obvious how one would create such a system in a practically useful way, at least not without immediately running into the same sorts of issues commonly used to criticise exception handling in terms of keeping track of every possible failure mode that lower level code could indicate.<p>One thing we do know is that if programmers are not absolutely compelled to handle errors then sometimes they won’t. The article itself cites an example from a very common library function widely called in C code among many other languages.<p>Another thing we know is that if programmers <i>are</i> compelled to handle errors then they will cheat. Specifically, sometimes they will write useless code to satisfy the technical requirements of the language while not in fact doing anything useful to recover from the error. Java’s checked exception mechanism is infamous for unintentionally promoting this sort of programming, and the paper cited by the post we’re discussing specifically calls this out as a real world problem.<p>A third thing we do know is that sometimes there isn’t anything useful you can do in response to some failures. Maybe your program simply won’t be able to complete its task successfully under those circumstances and the best you can do is fail as gracefully as possible.<p>Given these constraints, systematic error handling at an architectural level seems to be the more promising strategy, and there seems little reason to prefer fine-grained, manual error checking code everywhere instead.<p>Exceptions are one way of implementing error handling at an architectural level, and to me they have always seemed a natural fit for sound functional decomposition in a software design. As a base case, you can always reduce to a situation where an operation either completes successfully or it fails and you don’t distinguish between different types of failure. This is just the universal catch block or its equivalent in your language of choice. Anything more specific than that can be added as necessary. The one thing you can’t do is have higher level code accidentally continue as if there is nothing wrong once lower level code has explicitly indicated that a failure has occurred.<p>Another architecture-level strategy is an Erlang idiom, where a failed process is effectively allowed to crash completely, with a separate supervisor process then detecting this and perhaps restarting the failed process to recover. This is somewhat analogous to the base case with exceptions and universal catch, in that normal execution can’t inadvertently continue once a failure resulting in a crash happens.<p>It seems to me that either of these strategies, or any other systematic mechanism that imposes detection and recovery at an architectural scale, is likely to be more robust in the real world than a system that relies on manually checking everything. The latter, in the event of any oversight, <i>can</i> allow higher level code to continue to operate as if nothing is wrong even after code at a lower level has explicitly determined that a failure has occurred, presumably carrying around an error that may subsequently manifest as a different kind of failure and ultimately a system fault. This seems to be exactly what the article was trying to argue against, yet the proposed strategy for dealing with errors, one manual level at a time, seems to be just about the worst way we know to avoid it.",1450732659

It&#x27;s very surprising to see them invoked by the optimizer on more conventional platforms.  It might not satisfy djb, but a standard for these behaviors alone would be great progress.[2]<p>[1] <a href=""http://arcanesentiment.blogspot.com/2014/12/customary-semantics.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arcanesentiment.blogspot.com/2014/12/customary-semant...</a><p>[2] Posix doesn&#x27;t really address this, sadly.

There are other ways to type-check effects without monads (at least not explicit monads, and the monad laws don&#x27;t need to be checked): <a href=""http://blog.paralleluniverse.co/2015/08/07/scoped-continuations/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.paralleluniverse.co/2015/08/07/scoped-continuati...</a>",1450731696

As productivity goes up, services tend to get more expensive in terms of physical goods. Education is a service (as is health care, which is also out-pacing inflation).<p>2. Saving is extraordinarily difficult on a national and generational scale. Outside of saving easy-to-extract natural resources (oil) for later, basically the only other option is to make the next generation promise to make things later. This is why the lending standards are like they are for student and home loans - the economic pressures of retirement planning demand it.<p>3. Education is a positional good - you only need a degree for entry level jobs because you&#x27;re competing against degree holders. Since we&#x27;re getting better at providing absolute goods for our society, more resources are getting freed up to chase positional goods.<p>4. A good chunk of the price increases are getting made up with corresponding scholarships and need-based awards. Universities are less trying to gouge all their students, and more realizing that they can pull much more money from higher-income students. This is especially true for Ivy League and other prestigious schools.",1450731680

I feel that the &#x27;spectrum&#x27; is getting so wide that anyone that has any social issues, or has any odd habits is labeled as autistic now. It&#x27;s frustrating when I hear people that are fully functional in society and maybe just have a hard time socializing with people (probably because they grew up on facebook, etc... and never really interacted with real people) that say they are autistic. It is like the new ADHD. I spent the first 11 years of my daughters life changing diapers, usually with her fighting me the entire time. Wasn&#x27;t until she was 7 that she ever even called me dad. 15 now and can barely read Dr. Suess books or answer basic yes or no questions.<p>I worry that as more and more fully functioning people are added to the spectrum that it will result in less help out there for people like my daughter that really need it.",1450731649

Individuals who have marked deficits in social communication, but whose symptoms do not otherwise meet criteria for autism spectrum disorder, should be evaluated for social (pragmatic) communication disorder.<p>In some countries there was a huge resistance to this from purely non-medical associations, in the UK you can now get a referral for diagnosis from a nurse (previously it was only GP) and the diagnosis it self can be taken in one of the privately operated centers operating in the country like the ones which are operated by the national autism society (which while it does wonders for children) isn&#x27;t part of the NHS and is responsible for over 50% of the cases diagnosed since 2011, a vast majority of which were adults.<p>The diagnosis it self isn&#x27;t done by doctors but by &quot;professionals&quot; like &quot;speech therapists&quot; and &quot;developmental therapists&quot; which while are certified to some extent (although for the most part are self regulated as there is no government sponsored certification process for them) are not medical doctors.<p>This is why I looks to me like ADHD2.0 as in another case when non doctors and non clinical professionals got the power to diagnose a disorder which was almost tailored for pushing pills to children despite substantial resistance from actual medical professionals mainly from child and development psychiatrists and clinical psychologists.",1450731625

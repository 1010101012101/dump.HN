22802,comment,22642,22786,0,0,juwo,,,"Here is my business model:
 
NP will have two versions: The Editor and the Viewer. This is similar to Adobe Acrobat, which has the Publisher and the Reader. The Editor is full featured. For business users, a license fee of $150 will be charged for the Editor. It will not display advertisements.The Viewer has restricted functionality. It cannot create, nor add to the juwo indexes. It can only annotate or enrich existing indexes and share them. <p>The Viewer is free. It will carry advertisements that will be served dynamically on the landing page by a 3rd party advertisement server. Home users can upgrade the Viewer to the Editor for an online payment of $5. However it will still show advertisements. <p>Revenues are from three tracks: <p>License fee (free)<p>Consumer paying to upgrade from Viewer to Editor.<p>Banner advertisements ( e.g. Google Adsense)<p>Revenues per AV site = license fee + number of AV downloads <i> percent upgrading to editor </i> upgrade fee + revenue from banner advt.<p>see VC Fred Wilson's blog for calculation of banner advt. revenues for youtube.com which had 100M downloads per day and 19.8M unique visitors in June 2006. ($420K per day, 660K unique) <p>for a site with a free juwo license and only 1% of youtube's traffic. i.e. 1 million downloads<p>with only 1% upgrading, can potentially make $1.65M per year.<p>
Unfortunately, right now all that is simply castles in the air.",1179416030

I've done that with a couple other submissions that weren't immediately obvious.  For this one, it was late at night, I wanted to get some hacking done on my startup, and I was curious if people would understand the point without an explanation.  Evidently not.

22797,comment,22642,22654,0,0,juwo,,,"hey rms, thanks for thinking of me - I appreciate it!<p>I have a comparative analysis matrix - including veotag.<p>From it, Here are some ways IMHO juwo is better:<p>1) veotag can annotate only text even though they claim otherwise on the front page. see <a href=""http://www.veotag.com/whatis/?page=5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.veotag.com/whatis/?page=5</a><p>juwo can annotate with Text, voice, audio, video, links and documents.<p>Other reasons:
2) Veotag has a subset of juwoÂ’s functionality. 
3) Veotag is tied to a single AV clip.
4) It cannot be used outside of broadcasts. 
5) Not a standalone productivity tool. 
6) Limited privacy.<p>7) Can veotag Share and edit indexes
and annotations in a community? Limited. Share link to index. No concept of overlay.<p>8) Can veotag have Multiple uses for application? Not now. (skip to important parts of a single clip and see titles and notes)<p>",1179415457

22795,comment,22733,22733,0,0,sergiutruta,,,"of course it is...but a service which sends 1.000 or more messages, can negotiate a good price for the sms. For example let's say 4 cents. If you charge the publishers 4 cents for each ad, you'll be able to pay for the messages. If you negotiate a better price or charge more for the ads, you'll make extra cash ;)
Advertising on mobile phones is a really hot topic these days. But most of the implemented solutions are like this: you agree with the service to receive advertising messages, and you get something in return. This is not very efficient because the users can delete the messages without even opening them. I'll give more details in a dedicated article so stay tunned.",1179415406

I could say working at a consulting company who's on a project for a car manufacturer, on a project that improves the data quality of owners of cars - i'm making an impact because with better data, people are getting the right information / advertisments for cars that are right for them, thus improving their lives by helping them choose the right car.

Or maybe both.<p>Even with the narrow definition of culture, I can't say I agree. Austrian society is rather conservative. There may be progressive and industrious individuals, but I certainly not the country as a whole. I haven't lived in Germany, but I'd certainly say British people are more liberally minded and individualistic than Austrians.<p>Despite their disdain for politicians, Austrians will typically expect the state to solve their problems, and accept paying vast amounts in taxes. An example of this is higher education: the majority expects it to be completely free for students, very much at the expense of quality.<p>The civil service is enormous, inefficient and somewhat corrupt, but it seems to be accepted as a requirement for stability and welfare as a huge provider of jobs. Contrast this to the British fears of a ""nanny state"" and general grumbling about taxation.<p>Here's my theory how the differences came about:<p>1. You're right to point out a certain north/south gradient across Europe, but you're forgetting that Austria and Bavaria were historically the centre of the counter-reformation, unlike central and northern Germany. So, for a long time, very much catholic like southwestern Europe; even anti-protestant. Religion obviously has very much taken a back seat in recent decades, but culture (there's that word again) changes much more slowly.<p>2. The Austro-Hungarian Empire used to stretch deep into the Balkan and Eastern Europe. Although the German language dominates today, Slavic and Hungarian surnames and people's appearances today still hint at a past where Austria, and Vienna as the capital in particular, was much more heterogeneous. Even the use of the German language is also not quite as straightforward as it seems: the names for many foods are different from those used in Germany and have Slavic, Hungarian and Italian origins. (and I would personally consider food to be a part of a society's culture)<p>The English-German connection you point out is, by the way, quite far in the past. The Norman invasion of England injected a lot of latin vocabulary into the English language, and that was in the 11th century.<p>I'm not trying to make a moral judgment by the way; I have family in and from both countries. I can't predict which country will be more prosperous in 50 or 100 years' time; Austrians are probably the happier ones at the moment. I'll readily admit to having my own strong opinions on whether it will stay that way, but that's not really the point here.<p>For what it's worth, I likewise can't really comment on the differences in culture across the United States from personal experience. I'd be surprised, though, if the differences were as big as across Europe. (I'm leaving aside insular communities such as the Amish who deliberately do not mix with general society; you get those everywhere, and their populations tend to be small)",1331574531

-- Minimum wage laws
-- Laws that require companies to recognize and negotiate with unions
-- Universal healthcare
-- Mandatory coverage terms for health insurance<p>All of the above require the use of violence (or its threat) to coerce people to act in a way that the socialists approve of.<p>Libertarians (by principle) oppose these positions because they violate the NAP.  Socialists often support them. Also, practically, libertarians believe that all of the above make people worse off, increase poverty, etc.  The NAP is the principle, but the philosophy involves recognizing the economic effects of violating the NAP are always worse than respecting it.<p>I've always seen the open source movement as intrinsically libertarian, and in a way, capitalist.  If you don't like the terms of what's out there- compete.  Getting others to contribute their time to make the product better is just an efficient form of competition.

We do ourselves a great disservice to view the entertainment and media industries in those terms. In truth, ""Hollywood"" comprises thousands of companies, millions of individuals, and just as many agendas, business models, goals, and products. We can no more speak of ""Hollywood"" as having a single org structure or driving agenda than we can speak of ""America"" as a unified political and cultural mass. Just as not all Americans wanted to invade Iraq, not everyone in Los Angeles and New York wanted to push SOPA and PIPA legislation. (In fact, I'd bet that a majority in the entertainment business are personally opposed to SOPA and PIPA; I know I am).<p>Within Hollywood, there is a large and growing segment of content creators, producers, actors, writers, and directors who'd just as soon develop for technology ecosystems as they would for major movie studios and TV networks. And I believe technology firms are leading the way. Netflix is attempting to develop original programming. Microsoft is rumored to be doing the same. Apple's iTunes and App Stores represent entertainment ecosystems just waiting to be filled with direct-to-consumer content from Hollywood's best creators and production companies. Kickstarter offers an appealing platform for marketing and funding independent content. A major shift in production and consumption of entertainment isn't going to happen overnight; nor will it progress in linear fashion. More likely than not, a few big breakthroughs will inspire others. I am very optimistic that, sometime within the next two years, we'll be speaking of the first ""Hollywood"" series released directly -- and successfully -- to a tech platform. Once that happens, the floodgates will open in earnest. And, perhaps selfishly speaking, I am crossing my fingers that the new season of direct-to-Netflix ""Arrested Development"" finds a bigger audience than it did on TV.",1331573863

I've found that the HTML5 Canvas has been great for my needs.  It's certainly not at the point where it can compete with desktop games, but trying to make it do that seems absurd (is the browser really the right place for games like Mass Effect?)<p>That said, writing games in HTML5 is much harder than on other platforms, for example:<p>A) As the post mentions, the Audio APIs are embarrassingly bad. There is, as far as I can tell, no way which you can cause a sound to play (programmatically, I've never really tried to use the actual <audio> element) in a cross-browser compatible way without having to manually code for the different APIs.  One would think that Audio, one of the poster children for HTML5 would have <i>some</i> standardization.<p>B) Chrome/Safari (and probably IE too) refuse to rescale anything without interpolating it (e.g. no pixelated effects without manually resizing the imagedata).  Firefox offers a mozImageSmoothingEnabled property on the canvas element which allows for effects like this, but unless you're developing solely for Firefox, you're out of luck.<p>C) If you have a large enough canvas and you get the imagedata for it, Firefox can throw an exception because it's bigger than the largest allowed array.  This can be solved by manipulating the image data on a smaller canvas and drawing that canvas on a bigger one, but it's still an annoying inconsistency.<p>Those last two, while minor quibbles, are indicative of the kinds of problems I've run into several times while working with HTML5.  Each browser handles everything in a different way, and as far as I can tell, none of them care how the others work. This means that you must test every piece of code you write on every browser you wish to support.  Obviously, this has a significant negative impact on development time, and can make some games prohibitively difficult.<p>On the other hand, there are platforms like Java or Flash (or Unity, so I've heard), where you can write once and expect it to work identically everywhere (even on out of date browsers).

Usually an indent implies some kind of relation to the previous line.  For example when you indent the body of a function it helps to indicate that the body is part of the function.   There's a logical difference and most likely even a scope level difference.  The indents that you are adding to CSS don't work that way because each new line starts its select with no concern for the line above.<p>Also, there may be some deeply nested markup that doesn't require css except for the first and last level of nesting.  Are you supposed to then have a series of empty tab levels in your css file?  And then if you remove some of those nests in the markup, you have to remove them in the css?  Not nice.  The coupling provides no advantage.",1331573644

We must choose a family of distributions (a model) that we believe they live in and then perform statistical estimation to find the best representative of those families, call them f`(A|W) and g`(W).

The introduction of multi-touch gestures made a complete mess out of kids apps.  For example, if you've ever watched a young one interact with an iPad you would have seen them plant their paws on the screen and do things with 3+ fingers very frequently.<p>Imagine what happens then:  The whole app moves  up, down or worst, sideways and switches to another app altogether.  This interrupts the experience and is very confusing.  I've seen this first hand.  It is truly perplexing for children in the 2 to 7 year old range.<p>Another side-effect is that this makes it nearly impossible to write apps that actually encourage the little ones to fully engage and plant their paws on the device.  Without turning off multi-touch gestures the app won't be good for more than three seconds of use.  What's worst is that you also stand a good chance to get negative reviews on the app store from frustrated parents who don't understand that this is not the developer's fault.<p>Imagine the thrill of driving around town while your kids is playing with the iPad in the back seat and complaining/whining/crying every thirty seconds because he/she accidentally switched from the nice educational app you had them play with to your Facebook page due to accidentally using the app switching gesture.  Brilliant.<p>While multi-touch gestures might be a good idea (I as an adult never use them) they provide no way for developers to disable them within their app, thus causing usability problems for kids (and probably some use cases with people with motor impediments).<p>Yes, the user can disable multi-touch altogether from settings.  As an app developer you have to decide whether or not you want to put up a notice, warning or info page on your app warning parents about this problem and recommending that they disable multi-touch.

I remain unconvinced <i>even in large projects</i> but I do think CSS is lacking some important features that would make this kind of practice redundant; the kind of things that LESS and SASS provide, like variables and mixins.<p>> Heavily location selectors hinder flexibility; components should not rely too heavily on where they live, they should be movable as easily as possible.<p>This again makes presumptions about what kind of site you're building. If you're aiming for heavily modular, reusable components where you'll be repeating markup patterns throughout, it may be more appropriate. Nonetheless, the example you cited looked like a small, common pattern that is easily self-contained enough to be reused in this way.<p>> IDs will only ever hinder a CSS developer; they offer zero benefit (where CSS is concerned) over a class, thus why would you ever bother using them?<p>Specificity is an important part of the cascade, and a tool in your box. Being able to target an element with a higher priority than another without needlessly complicating the selector is a feature I wouldn't voluntarily give up just because of some nebulous claim of harm they might cause. Another reason is the same one I don't agree with stripping off element names; they are self-documenting and give developers clear, unavoidable signposts about the nature of the elements they're targeting.<p>> Ive just finished the rebuild a massive front-end, the project as a whole took over a year. Number of IE stylesheets: 0. It can be done.<p>Every project is different. Some will accept layout degradation in older browsers. Some won't. Some will demand extravagant layout effects that require extra time and effort to get working well in IE6-8. To suggest that IE-specific stylesheets are something you should be striving to omit is to needlessly burden developers with (potentially) unreachable goals.<p>That's the crux of my problem with these best practices  developers who've yet to spend a lot of time thinking about how to structure their CSS well could come across these and head off in all manner of wrongheaded directions. Maybe that's why there aren't any universally agreed-upon CSS best practices beyond more simple techniques; the general rule I take with me is YMMV.",1331572165

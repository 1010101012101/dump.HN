The problem right now is that so many things have moved so far, that there simply isn't a known pattern that will work.<p>Generally speaking, you now need a compiler.  If not to install something other than a quite old system ruby, then to install common gems like nokogiri.<p>XCode seems to change significantly every release.  Not long ago, you had to download it, or get it from your system CDs.  Then you had to buy it from the app-store.  Then you got it for free from the app-store.  Then you got the installer for free from the app-store, and had to run the installer.  And today I think you get the installer, which you run, and then you go through a series of menus to get to ""install command line tools"" (like gcc).<p>Once gcc is there, then you need a ruby.  There's RVM and rbenv.  Those need to be found, installed (by running a curl command piped through bash), and then a ruby needs to be installed.  I use RVM, which is easy enough for me, and it does install bundler by default (which is good).<p>Once you have a modern ruby, you probably want a database other than sqlite.  For that, you usually need homebrew.  Again, install homebrew, and then have homebrew install postgresql/mysql.<p>At this point you are almost ready to install the rails gem.<p>Oddly, a lot of the newer complexity has less to do with Rails, and has more to do with the Ruby ecosystem getting both older and more complex at the same time.<p>Every time I help a new developer get started with the rails environment, I too am amazed at how much has changed since I setup my own laptop one year ago.",1332979139

3768956,comment,3768206,3768725,1,0,shingen,,,"It wasn't rude. The super rich in America control far less wealth today in proportion to the total economy than they did in 1900, when Rockefeller by himself controlled wealth equal to 1/45th of GDP. At his peak, Carnegie was even wealthier than Rockefeller. The ten richest Americans at the time controlled wealth equal to 1/20th of all GDP.<p>To accomplish that feat today, someone like Gates would need to be worth nearly $350 billion. The top ten would need to be worth $800 billion.<p>In the 19th century, private individuals used to fund wars, because they were more powerful and wealthier than the nation states going to war. The Morgan family, JP and his father Junius, funded wars by shuttling money through their banking empire on both sides of the Atlantic. Nation states had to borrow war funds from private banks & enterprises. The thought of that today is laughable, when the US military vaporized a trillion on the latest Iraq war alone.<p>In the panic of 1907, JD Rockefeller pledged his wealth to stabilize the system - specifically he offered JP Morgan a guaranteed backing that he could use to assist the US Treasury in stabilizing imbalances that threatened to crash the economy. That notion would be comical today, when the Fed prints a trillion every six to eight months depending.<p>The idea that the rich are richer today in relation to the economy, than the early industrial days of America, is an absurd myth that isn't backed up by any data. It's pure propaganda.",1332979019

3768950,comment,3768548,3768548,7,0,dmbaggett,,,"Back in the 90s, at Naughty Dog, we worked 100 hour weeks. After three years, people started to go crazy. By the end of Crash Bandicoot 2, one of the artists went completely ape about something random on a level we were working on and threw a chair at me. It was at that moment that I realized that our limits were biological and not simply a matter of will.<p>We pulled all-nighters in which only a handful of us were doing more than one trivial task per hour. 100 hour weeks were sustainable if you didn't mind the occasional psychotic outburst. All-nighters were uniformly unproductive.<p>I do not believe that working 130 hours is physically possible for more than a single week. This sounds like ""no, really, I <i>deserve</i> to have hundreds of millions of dollars,"" because ""I just worked <i>so</i> hard."" I don't believe it. I also think it's a horrible model for entrepreneurs.<p>If you want to produce great work, get enough rest, exercise, and perspective. If early Google employees really did what Marissa says, they should be thankful that they were lucky enough to overcome it, not credit their success to it.<p>We all know early Google employees made an absolute crapload of money. But not because of 130-hour weeks. Because they had the guts to work on a search engine when, in Marissa's words, ""There were already twelve search engines and it was unclear why the world needed another one.""<p>I remember <i>everyone</i> thinking that. Kudos to Larry, Sergey, Marissa, et al for improving search <i>just because</i>, and <i>later</i> ending up with the most lucrative business model in the history of the world. But shame on Marissa for perpetuating the myth that working stupid hours and abusing yourself (and others) is the path to success. It isn't.",1332978900

3768927,comment,3768351,3768351,36,0,samstave,,,"I posted the following in another thread the other day, but that thread was deleted. I think it is relevant here:<p>--------<p>I worked for a company that was acquired by Lockheed. I ran IT and had already spent a few years 100% rebuilding the infrastructure of the company when I joined.<p>As we were assimilated I worked with IS&S and their security teams closely to ensure our security measures were up to snuff with Lockheed's requirements (we built the RFID tracking system the military used for shipping pretty much everything)
In our security meetings, we were briefed on activities that were happening, what we needed to do and why.<p>China was constantly attacking Lockheed and all other defense contractors.<p>They were pretty sophisticated in how they did it; targetted spear phishing was one of their successes:<p>Chinese spies would attend defense contractor events - meet and seek out lockheed and other employees. Get their business cards and spoof mail from one employee to the other, referring to events that occured at the convention to get people to click on shit that would be a trojan.
These trojans were rather sophisticated in that they would operate very very slowly to trickle pieces of information out. Sometimes they were very specific pieces of information.<p>I don't recall exactly how this was found out, but someones machine was being checked out - and in the process the trojan was found. When the chinese were alerted to the fact that the trojan had been found, they turned whatever their bot-net was up to 11 and attempted to just mass send out as much data as they could.<p>(All of lockheed only has (I think) 3 connections to the internet)<p>They cut it off and had to get rid of these trojans.<p>Another time, a supplier (I think it was in Taiwan, I cant recall exactly) a supplier was hacked and its machines would install stuff on any USB sticks used.<p>Lockheed machines were not allowed to connect to non-lockheed networks, via Wifi or any other means. So they would use USB sticks to transfer stuff.<p>The chinese went after the suppliers machines as a vector to get connected with the lockheed machines.
I have mentioned this stuff here on HN before, and in light of China's 50-100 year vision for where they want to be, we are basically fucked.
The chinese have been securing access to all major natural resources in Africa, as well as being the manufacturing hub for EVERYTHING - while the US government is squabbling over petty short term profit efforts and securing a diminishing resource (oil).<p>This is not to say the US is some slouch in the cyber security space; Stuxnet and Doqu are clearly US/Israel cyber attacks that are amazing.

That leaves only 6 hours for food, drink, cleaning, sleeping and socialising. It is possible if you enjoy your work, don't require much sleep, are able to mix socialising with work, and pay for somebody else to do your cleaning. For the vast majority of individuals it is unrealistic, depression inducing and unlikely to make their bosses or themselves richer.<p>(2) If you're trying to become more productive this is an extremely stupid idea. Using more of your time is at most a linear improvement in work output; if you wish to do more work you should spend time reading about and practicing methods of doing more in an hour. Technology and knowledge have the capacity to be multipliers, so: learn how to scale repetitive tasks, learn quicker ways of programming, learn better ways of analysing problems, learn how to automate as much as you can. An extra couple of hours spent practicing these things will give far superior gains in work output.<p>(3) We should optimize for happiness. Don't spend all of your time working unless you enjoy working.<p>I quite happily work 60-80 hour work weeks and will push myself a little further if there is a deadline. This number includes lunch times, a very short commute and non-fiction books and articles to help keep my mind sharp.

I'm largely interested in what works, not why. I've largely steered towards behavioral economics because there's clear experimental evidence that's easily understood. Social games use BE effectively and often (although it is not clear to me how many developers really understand what they're doing, and how many are just copying Zynga).<p>Skinner is not entirely rejected by everyone (Ariely uses variable schedules as to describe email addiction in Predictably Irrational), and it seems to make sense when you're discussing reduced problems like slot machines or email. However, it feels too reductionist for all problems.<p>I'm largely working more with Daniel Pink's Autonomy/Mastery/Purpose framework, which seems to do a lot better at describing why people are encouraged to perform more complex tasks over and over, particularly games. Games tweak AMP very directly, and they fail quickly when one isn't in alignment. Autonomy is the freedom to make decisions, mastery is the space to get better at something and continue learning, purpose is discovering that what you're doing matters to you.<p>What people are seeking is usually feedback. Feedback about themselves, feedback from others. Feedback is usually the only reward you get, but feedback is what is required for AMP to work; you need to know what choices you are actually making (autonomy), you need to know how well you're doing (mastery), whether what you're doing is affecting anything that matters (purpose). Feedback is what drives people that care about karma on Hacker News or Reddit.<p>HN is a decent example of this if you're karma-oriented: you can write what you want (autonomy), but you can't do much to encourage people to agree or upvote (mastery), and if no-one upvotes you, you lose your purpose. Instead, if you focus on a goal like ""writing makes me better at understanding my own ideas"", you really can get a real AMP thing going. How many blogs have died because the author thought no-one was reading?<p>I think designing for AMP is the real desire engine; a self-perpetuating intrinsic motivation built on feedback.",1332976833

The syntax is clear and (for the most part) un-intrusive. Some of it's idioms really force you to think about what you have learned in other languages. And then either forget any of that ever happened, or at the very least become a critical thinker about the usefulness of these things. For example: the standard inheritance based OOP model.<p>Go simply allows me to 'get shit done' fast and without having to jump through hoops. It's very much like a breath of fresh air in what was quickly becoming a stale and obnoxious development environment (for me at least).<p>Edit: I would add that I do not particularly like evangelising about anything; that includes Go.

There are a handful of things off-limit but in almost all cases you can view the data and code and announcements for almost every project in Google;<p>4. The level of meetings and overall bullshit has been, in my experience, incredibly low compared to previous employers;<p>5. Performance reviews are peer-driven. This system is not perfect and you'll have critics who point to thinks like you need senior people around you to get promoted. Some of these claims have merit but the system while not perfect is still (IMHO) very good; and<p>6. Gratitude. As Steve Yegge [1] puts it:<p>> You can't help but want to do your absolute best for Google; you feel like you owe it to them for taking such incredibly good care of you.<p>I find many of these alleviate burnout by way of mitigating resentment. I'm not sure I fully agree that burnout is solely caused by resentment however. I've known people who have been well-rewarded and respected for what they've done but they just reach a point where they need a break and have to do something else. I'd characterize this as burnout but perhaps definitions vary.<p>Lastly, I'll touch on a point someone else mentioned: as time goes on my tolerance for bullshit and time-wasting goes down. No I'm not going to your daily standup (""mini performance review"") because it's a waste of my time. No I'm not going to work on your shitty project that's made shitty technology choices for political rather than technical reasons. I don't have the time nor inclination to indulge you in this.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/09/good-agile-bad-agile_27.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/09/good-agile-bad-agile...</a>",1332976562

Yet things like this show that you have NO CONTROL over these services.  I don't believe that this ""social media"" thing can support the marketeer's for a sustainable period.  Building your own sites, on your own servers, on your own domain (and yes, I realize that domain names are really more leased than owned, but there is at least a central semi-logical process behind most of it), seems like a far more logical approach.  Twitter, Facebook, Flicr, etc. only need to make a minor change, or toss in the towel, and all this marketing effort will have disappeared into the ether.",1232830659

448390,comment,448378,448378,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"It'll pass.  It did for me, anyway.  For about two or three months, I was here <i>all the time</i>.  I was clicking ""override"" on the procrastination page five or ten times a day.  But, it came from being unfocused about my work--I didn't have a clear, and exciting, vision of where I was going or how to get there, so I was putting off doing anything.<p>I did two things:<p>1. Started working on music again (which always excites me, but I had to give myself permission to take time off for something fun--I was wasting that time dicking around on the Internet, anyway, so I might as well have something to show for that time).<p>2. Sat down one day and figured out the overarching vision for my company and my development for the next week, month, and three months (don't think too far ahead--it causes paralysis because the job looks too big).  This triggered several great ideas for big visible improvements in the product that don't cost me much time or effort or money (outsourcing brain-dead tasks to cheap labor, for example--for our website builder, for example, I just got 50 new Open Source templates added for $149...this would have taken two or three full days of my time, on a task that would make me nauseous with its tediousness, but for the guy who did it, it was easily a couple of weeks normal wages).  Some of these ideas expanded my productivity dramatically, because it takes the work off of my plate almost entirely, but it still gets done.<p>What I'm saying is that if spending your time <i>here</i> is satisfying your accomplishment receptors better than your own work, then you're probably doing your own work wrong.  You're treating the symptom rather than the disease.<p>Oh, and leave yourself something unfinished at the end of each day (this is old hat for GTD people, but I never really paid attention to any of that stuff).  It actually works if you have something to do each day <i>instead</i> of going to HN first, you'll probably find you just keep doing things rather than reading random crap on the Internet.",1232830096

The only thing preventing this from being acceptable to employers is the college mystique. If the college mystique gets punctured... and I can't think of a faster way than to jack the price up beyond what anybody can afford... and it becomes acceptable to have an online degree, what happens to conventional colleges then? On a pure dollar-for-dollar comparison, the online colleges will kill conventional colleges for value.<p>You might find this hard to believe if you went to college and took some actually non-trivial course, such as in engineering. Leave engineering and the hard sciences, though, and a lot of courses are just mind-bogglingly trivial to pass. As part of a learning content management system I worked on while in school, I once had to debug a junior-level marketing course, so I took some of the pop quizzes from the middle of the course. I got 7/10 and 8/10... and there are people who actually <i>attended the course</i> who didn't do that well.<p>I shouldn't be able to score 8/10 on a pop quiz for a junior level course in an unrelated discipline. There probably wasn't a single 300-level engineering or hard science course I could have done that on. But... not everybody going to college are getting degrees like that. (And, ultimately, quite a lot of even the hard courses could be moved online with little loss...)<p>(I said ""vast swathes of many college programs"" very carefully. There are yet some programs that aren't very replaceable, and will always have a physical component. Another way for a college to get around this is to make their courses less able to be taken remotely, although as technology marches on it gets harder and harder to imagine what exact form that would take... A lot of people complain about various problems with online courses vs. real courses but I find myself wondering how much of that is truly fundamental, vs. how much of that could be fixed with better technology.)<p>I'm not sure I could agree with ""useless"", but ""poor value"" and ""easily replaceable with a cheaper but just-as-good-maybe-better substitute"" I sure could agree with.<p>If some startup could get past the accreditation hurdle...",1232829821

What impressed me most, however, was that when one of his employees gave a waffly non-answer to a question from the audience, he called him on it (subtly and politely), and made the guy commit to a real answer to the question...and made him personally responsible for it (with a comment along the lines of, ""You can email him for that information and he'll get it to you."").<p>It was interesting to see, and it struck me as one of the things about Bezos that can explain how he has been so successful with a ""bookstore on the web"" when so many other ""X on the web"" concepts failed.  You can't control every customer interaction in a company that size, but in that moment he established a precedent for that particular group of employees (probably folks who don't deal with customers a lot, since they were tech folks from AWS).<p>What I'm saying is that Bezos has certainly drunk some kind of obsessively customer-focused Kool-Aid, and I think I would take any opportunity I could to learn from him.",1232829426

I'll tell you how I became convinced of this.<p>(this is kind of long for a HN post but it's a funny story)<p>I was having a discussion with a room full of college graduates recently.  The meeting was about how managers should, when they have to order employees to do something, go in with the mindset of convincing the employees that the decision is wise rather than just dictate it to them.  In the discussion I jokingly said something like ""Don’t go all Lenin on them"".  They countered by saying they didn’t understand what I meant.  After a short and very confusing discussion I said I didn’t understand how they could equate what I was saying to what was done in Communist Russia.  They responded by asking what Russia had to do with anything?<p>At that point it hit me: They were talking about John Lennon.  They had no idea who Vladimir Lenin was.<p>The reason this had such an impact on me (aside from the obvious) is this: I’ve long been convinced that universities simply don’t care about practical skills anymore.  A Computer Science graduate, for instance, can often graduate without having ever written a line of html, javascript or css.  But the one excuse Universities had was that at least they were still teaching culture.  This incident dispelled that myth for me and at that point I had lost all faith in the current university system.<p>I still believe in education but I don't believe Universities are providing a good one anymore.",1232829116

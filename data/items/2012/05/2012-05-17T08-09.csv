Not arguing about their evilness, but the fact remainsnot always you can simply rename .css to .less and gradually start using new features. (In the end I kept CSS as is, with a separate Stylus file with overrides and new styles. SCSS wasn't an option, and I have a feeling it also suffers from these issues.)",1337245183

Currently, the main challenges for implementing this clinically are<p>1) stability of the electrode array over long timescales.<p>2) increasing the number of degrees of freedom of robust control that we can decode from the neural data. Activity in the motor cortex inherently lives in a (very) roughly 10 dimensional space, which is a bit of a mystery since we use thy activity to control hundreds of muscles independently. What this means, is that when you record from 96 electrodes simultaneously, many of the neurons picked up by the array are correlated, such that the resulting dimensionality is much lower than the number of neurons<p>3) An important step forward will be to develope optogenetic (or other) sensory write in, using pulses of light to activate neutrons in specific patterns that mimic priprioceptive signals from your limbs. This will increase the speed and robustness of movent via faster closed loop feedback.<p>4) Processing power.  Currently it's typical to run decoders on real-time PC's. Creating an embedded processor capable of sufficiently low power operation with enough processing power to run the decode is non-trivial, especially if you want to implant this in the brain.<p>It is very unlikely, as suggested elsewhere, that current web tech will impact BMI research at all. The primary interesting tech is in the decode algorithm, which is a modified form of the Kalman filter. There is, however, a lot of room for hackers in research. I recently made the switch from working in defense, building robots and designing sensor fusion algorithms, to a phd in neuroscience. Probably won't pay as well long term, but it's far more rewarding and interesting! I'm surrounded by scientists that need better (software and hardware) tools and analysis methods.  Also, an infusion of ideas and values aligned with open access publishing (or changing the scientific publishing model altogether), open source software, data and code sharing, etc. would generally benefit all and accelerate scientific research, but that's another topic worthy of more discussion elsewhere.",1337244287

The original syntax, called ""the indented syntax"" uses a syntax similar to Haml.[2] It uses indentation to separate code blocks and newline characters to separate rules. The newer syntax, ""SCSS"" uses block formatting like that of CSS. It uses curly brackets to denote code blocks and semicolons to separate lines within a block.

Its important to note that Sass also has an older syntax, which omits semicolons and curly brackets. Although this is still around, it is old and we wont be using it past this example.

Out of 56 non-external article links the site's home page, only three lead to non-political articles.  Those are, respectively, a story about congressmen having their houses burglarized, a take on the BrainGate robotic arm story, and a stub of an article mentioning that 13% of US citizens are born abroad.<p>Having read the text of the talk, it is in my opinion completely political, and while I may agree with his basic point; he fails to cite examples of where implementation of his propositions had any positive effect.  The tone of self-righteous loathing used when describing his ideological opponents does little to encourage sober consideration of his arguments.<p>As a final point, the speech makes no attempt to address the bear in the room, i.e., the question of whether it is right to take by force from one person and give to another, regardless of how beneficial the effects.<p>It's an extremely political talk being publicized by an entirely political web site with a title more suited to a Girls Gone Wild commercial than talk on socioeconomics.

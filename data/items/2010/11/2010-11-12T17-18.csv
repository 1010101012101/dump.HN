The idea of allowing a computer to choose which words to use, or where punctuation should go, or anything like that, is unsettling to me.  The translation model works for programming languages because compilers have no emotions, but any message that starts out in shorthand with the intention of being read by a human is intrinsically hamstrung.<p>In fact, this can be true for programming languages, too!  C is like short-hand; the compiler is what turns our netspeak (C) into ""Proper English"" (assembly/machine code).  It usually works, but sometimes you just have to dip into assembly to <i>really</i> express what you mean.",1289584772

Once you download the package, since WP7 makes you write in .NET, anyone can just look at your executable and get the MSIL back out of it, and decompile to C# or whatever.<p>So...what?  This has been true for every C# application written since .NET existed, on every platform.  Welcome to the world of bytecode.  What is Microsoft supposed to do to magically change this on Windows Phone?  Even if they encrypted everything all the way down from the marketplace, as soon as someone roots the phone, they could just look at the executable on disk, right?<p>Why is bytecode obfuscation no longer an OK solution?<p>What am I missing here?

In a 6400x6400 grid, the future temperature of each cell is an average of the cells around it.  I've written it in C (single threaded)  and it takes 40 minutes to run on an Intel nehelem.  I've written it in Matlab and it takes 7 hours.  Finally I wrote it in Matlab using the GPGPU plugin Jacket.   It took 20 minutes.  That's a 2x speed up over the serial code, with all the abstraction and overhead of Matlab.  Next is a test in C with CUDA, but I was still very impressed with the performance of GPGPU in Matlab.<p>In our HPC lab, we see plugins like Jacket to be a valid substitute for translation of calculations from Matlab to C/fortran.  While not the most efficient use of hardware, it is very simple to do and can drastically speed up many applications.",1289584471

You need to develop a repeatable sales process for your business - this book will teach you how.<p>Note:  I have no affiliation with the above book/authors/publishers....I have been in software/technical sales for over 10 years, and I happen to think this is best place to get started.<p>Right now you are letting the buyer control the sales process.  The other folks here are correct that you need to find out:<p>1) Do they have funds budgeted for this already?  What budget will this come out of?  When does their budget year end?
2) How does their buying process work?  Who has final approval?  Does this decision have to go to a committee if the cost is over $XX,XXX?<p>3) If your software solves a problem...how are they solving that problem now?  What ""pain"" do they have associated with how they are doing things now?  You need to find out what their ""critical issue"" is.<p>4) What is the business case for your product?  People don't buy ""cool features"" or ""neat software"" they buy products that solve business issues.  If you are selling something above a certain price point, the decision will eventually be made by someone non-technical....and you need to have a strong ROI case built for that person to get the order.<p>If you don't know the above information, never do a demo.  If a prospect refuses to share this type of information, they are not serious and you should move on to the next one.  Sometimes the best sales opportunities are the ones that you lose quickly....don't be afraid to lose the sale quickly.  Focus your efforts on serious buyers who are willing to share information on their budget, purchasing process, etc.",1289584423

1898462,comment,1897873,1897873,0,0,ja27,,,"I got a 3G Kindle 3 several weeks ago.<p>I find that I mostly use it to read fiction. I'll probably eventually find it good for nice linear nonfiction like autobiographies. That's good because I've really gotten away from reading fiction, instead spending my reading time reading short-attention-span junk online. I love getting back to really reading.<p>I've tried it for a number of technical books, but it's just not that useful for that. It does an ok job displaying an unconverted PDF and a pretty good job working with a Calibre-converted PDF or CHM. I haven't tried an actual Kindle-formatted technical book, which could have better navigation. It's not displaying the page that's a problem. It's that when I'm reading a technical book, I need to flip around a lot. Search helps a bit, but flipping back and forth between sections is really cumbersome. Even with highlights and bookmarks, it's still tremendously slower than sticking a few post-it notes or thumbs in an actual print book. And most of the time that I want to look at a technical book, I'm already in front of at least one computer.<p>I haven't tried RSS feeds to the Kindle, but Instapaper is awesome for it and will only get better.<p>I rarely use the wireless at all. I struggled with buying the 3G vs. the wifi-only model. In the end I thought the 3G feature would extend the usefulness enough to make it worthwhile. In a pinch it's a decent email client and Wikipedia renders well. If I didn't have an Android and iPod Touch with me most of the time, I might use the Kindle wireless more.<p>One really important thing about the Kindle wifi: it won't connect to ad-hoc networks. This would have burned me if I'd bought the wifi-only model because I'd figured I could wifi tether it to my Android phone, but that runs in ad-hoc mode, so no connection.",1289584350

If you have other actions related to doctors like /doctors/mjones/contact, this way can provide a more coherent organization. Plus you can extend it to something like /labs/questdiagnostic/mri/slots?
So you can decouple the concept of 'slots' from doctor, allowing you to extend it to other types of appointments without having to alter slots. The parameters are the items that are also the most likely to vary. When making an appointment you will check multiple days, but you are much less likely to check multiple doctors.

I don't think there's any shame in that. Couple signs you lack maturity: You think the finish line is after another 20% of development, you think you can work a 9-5 day as a developer, and your own self-admitted lack of discipline. Have you ever finished anything? Finishing is hard. If you lack the discipline to do it on your own, going out into the real world and having an entire team/company relying on you to finish is a really good forcing function to learn how to do it. To learn how to edit. To learn how to compromise. To learn how to just muscle through it. To see that after you finish, some things you just ""HAD TO DO"" didn't actually need to be done at all because it turns out no one uses them. Etc.<p>* If you're only getting 2 hours of work in a day, you can probably do it on top of your ""9-5"" job.<p>* And why not just launch? You might be 20% away from development completion, but there's another 100% to go after that in terms of customer development, sales, support, etc. You don't even know if you have one viable customer yet. If you're really at 80% shouldn't it be easy to at least pre-sell to one customer? I mean do you even have a single lead yet?<p>Good luck.",1289581490

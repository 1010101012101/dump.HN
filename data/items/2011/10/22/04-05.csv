More specifically, each object has a self.value attribute that serves as a cache of the object's content. When it is notified that something has changed, it deletes the value. When you access it, it recomputes itself from scratch, taking advantage of caches of subobjects where possible.<p>You can see most of the logic in fern.ast.node.Node. self.refresh_impl is supposed to set self.value in a way appropriate to the subclass, and the Node functions handle the rest.<p>This is actually a pain to debug, especially with lots of nested scopes, but it seems to me like the evaluation should be lazy, rather than changing one object potentially re-computing the entire tree when you only cared about one part.

Apparently about 90% (or something) of the people taking it have had at least some programming experience.<p>I also don't think SICP is <i>perfect</i>; however, I think it inherently much better than anything--even itself--done in Python simply because Python basically forces less breadth. I recently read an interesting paper[1] that I think could lead to an even better class; if you're interested in this sort of thing, it's worth checking out.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.sics.se/~seif/Publications/fdp.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sics.se/~seif/Publications/fdp.pdf</a><p>It's also not really designed for a completely introductory class, but I hope that most of the people coming into Berkeley CS aren't <i>completely</i> unprepared.<p>On a slightly unrelated note, a completely different approach to an intro class could be cool too: instead of focusing on learning, maybe the first semester should be dedicated to just building something cool on a computer and letting the learning happen naturally. The more formal classes can always come later. For something like that, I could see using Python--although it wouldn't be my first choice by far--but that's a completely different story.",1319256541

I'm in my late 40's.<p>I usually use some system to take frequent breaks, usually an egg timer set to 10-15 minute intervals.<p>Every couple weeks, I'll isolate each eye and practice focusing near and far. I use trigger point therapy to work on the small muscle around the eye-sockets.<p>In general, I  practice a couple of movement and relaxation exercises - Qigong and the Alexander technique. I've been using a standing work station for last six months but been using the computer heavily since about 1990 this is just extra.<p>I tend not avoid categories like ""bad eyes"" or ""need glasses"". If my eyes happen to have trouble focusing, I assume the muscle are tired and need some attention. I've heard that glasses just encourage eyes to get worse. I don't know if that's true but seems plausible. I'd view the body in general as involving many nested feedback loops. I believe that people who experience ""health problems"" often assume that they are ""broken"" in fashion akin to a simple machine where they often simply need ""recalibrating"".

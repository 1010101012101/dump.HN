We're still well within the bounds of normal, habitable historical temperatures.""<p>This is a severe oversimplification, IMHO. Human society is sensitive not just to whether the Earth is overall habitable, but to impacts to the significant ""sunk costs"" we have in the locations of population centers. It's not much comfort to the people of California if the Earth remains habitable <i>on average</i> when the Sierra snowmelt disappears and the state faces a drought of unprecedented proportions.<p>""4. Carbon dioxide currently makes up 0.3% of the greenhouse gases including water vapor, and about 5% of the non-water vapor greenhouse gases. Carbon dioxide increases are lagging temperature increases - suggesting that CO2 is not the biggest culprit of global warming.""<p>Where do you get that CO2 is 0.3% of greenhouse gases? It's true that water vapor is the largest contributor to the greenhouse effect, but CO2 is next. It accounts for 50% of the non-water greenhouse gases and for <i>way</i> more than 0.3% of the total greenhouse effect. Besides, counting water is a little spurious because the water content of the atmosphere is set <i>by</i> the temperature. Thus, if temperature goes up, water content goes up. So saying that CO2 doesn't matter because water vapor is much more important is wrong, it's precisely the opposite. CO2 matters <i>more</i> because its effect is amplified by water. (Barring controversies about cloud covers.)<p>CO2 is also the greenhouse gas that has the longest lifetime in the atmosphere. The others (methane, etc) break down a lot quicker.",1261176721

It's all relative, but who's more neutral seems to be what they have to gain.  Who benefits more by being right?  If big oil is right then they get to carry on using fossil fuels until we run out.  By some estimates there's still several trillion dollars of oil, coal, etc in the ground yet to be extracted.<p>If global warming advocates are right what do they get?  Gold star, notoriety for being great scientists, pat on the back and a gold watch?  Even billions of dollars in research grants?  Once they're right research money dries up, and you still have to fix the energy crisis that would ensue.  And, big oil is handing out money left and right for any study saying the opposite.  If funding were your only incentive you could just as easily get money from the other side.  If you can prove global warming is or IS NOT caused by human activity you'll be very very famous, maybe rich.<p>Still that's paltry in comparison to the revenue of the oil, coal, and to some degree gas industries.  I can't seem to make the the pay offs for being right equal out.<p>I like to not be so paranoid, but quite frankly this whole debate just seems like a smoke screen from both sides at the moment.

1004125,comment,1003404,1004006,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> I was thinking about this the other day: what _is_ the best scientific statement we can make, at present, about anthropogenic global warming?<p>Here's what it seems like:<p>1. The Earth is warming at a slow rate, but at least some of this is natural as temperatures were historically considerably higher, then considerably lower than now.<p>2. We're still well within the bounds of normal, habitable historical temperatures.<p>3. Warming definitely occurs at local levels with deforesting, mining, and urbanization. This can decrease condensation and make areas less habitable to life. This can be stabilized to a large extent by planting trees, restoring soil quality, and so on.<p>4. Carbon dioxide currently makes up 0.3% of the greenhouse gases including water vapor, and about 5% of the non-water vapor greenhouse gases. Carbon dioxide increases are lagging temperature increases - suggesting that CO2 is not the biggest culprit of global warming.<p>5. That said, fossil fuels will gradually be replaced - the two current biggest hurdles are battery quality and political/public fears about nuclear power. Nuclear has gotten incredibly more stable and safe, and the advent of thorium reactors is exciting. Innovations in batteries and transitions to next generation nuclear will reduce fossil fuels a lot.<p>6. Much of green technology isn't so green - in many areas, turbines and solar panels take enough energy to create that they won't ""pay back"" their energy cost within 50 years, at which point we'll likely be able to produce energy much cheaper anyways. Some areas are very well suited for green energy - deserts with solar, very windy areas with turbines, hydroelectric on rivers, but they're brute forcing some very Earth-unfriendly alternative energy into areas it's not well suited for. Much of what's called green is marketing.<p>Personal judgment call based on everything I've seen? Money into R&D for hydrogen power, better batteries, fusion, and safer next-gen nuclear probably goes a lot further towards cleaning up the Earth than the current proposed solutions. Fossil fuels seem like they're going to largely be obsolete within 100-150 years or sooner, and rumors of the Earth's imminent demise appear to be greatly exaggerated.",1261174910

It's simply moving in a similar direction, and taking a few of Twitter's ideas that work for its social graph.<p>Does anybody remember Facebook's original feed, which was the first controversial invention of theirs? Even back then they were working on categorizing and indexing everybody's social goings-on. The fact that Twitter does something similar doesn't make Facebook a competitor. I use both Twitter and Facebook's public search, and Facebook's has a much different feel about it than Twitter's does.<p><i>It feels more to me like fb is moving more toward ""make something we can sell"" than ""make something people want.""</i><p>I don't like the ""make something people want"" meme. It's too bend-over for me to approve of. But Facebook's not making something they can sell. Public search isn't any more profitable than what they're already doing, which has put them in the green. Rather, they're focusing on making what <i>they</i> want. I'm certain their motives are more selfish than money: From the beginning, Mark and kin's focus has been on studying the patterns of how people interact, and Facebook's design has consistently reflected that. They're not doing that for money, they're doing it because that's what their goal is.",1261174410

Put up some code samples on SourceForge or GitHub or RubyForge or similar, and link them from your various social sites.<p>Put up a resume online, and link it from at least the social sites.  A blog is optional, and will help less with recruiters, but is worth considering.  It's a good habit in any case, but lower effort-to-results ratio than the other things I'm suggesting.  A portfolio, like a blog, is more effort but will pay off in the long run.  Don't do it first, but do it eventually.<p>Recruiters do a lot of ""networking"" -- scraping the web for resumes and addresses, sending messages on LinkedIn, et cetera.  Usually that's annoying, but in your case it can be a way to meet recruiters quickly.<p>All the above, in addition to attracting recruiters, gives you something to show them and gives them something to show potential employers.  So you'll also be somebody they <i>want</i> to show off, because you make them look good.

Lots of people get out of school and go into high tech recruiting.  There's no barrier to entry, but it takes a lot of hard work to stay one.  They bop around for 3-6 months, and if they don't show some aptitude they get cycled out.  See if you can get to know people a little older and have been out there a couple of years.  Don't just work with one recruiter.  Have several from different companies looking for you.<p>Go to your local user group meetings.  Java, Ruby, Php, Python, .Net, Flex, whatever.  (If you get too niche chances are you'll strike out).  Typically there are always someone there handing out business cards, or job postings.  Take it and send them a nice email introducing yourself the next day along with your resume.<p>If you have friends that have been out of school for a while try and connect with them.  They might know of good people to put you in contact with.<p>LinkedIn is like crack for recruiters.  Make sure you're on there and have some of your experience on there.  Connect with people.  You'll start to see who is a recruiter very quickly (500+ connections) chances are they're a recruiter.  LinkedIn helps you keep in contact with recruiters if they move companies too.<p>Put your resume on Dice.

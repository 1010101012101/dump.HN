Because most humans can be counted upon to exercise their individual moral judgment on matters of grave importance.<p>The grouping of minor leakers into the category of armchair anarchists diminishes the role of independent moral discretion that may have motivated their actions.  Even if it's poorly formed/articulated, I think the leakers have a sense of the moral consequences of their compliance with secrecy rules, which explains why they risk punishment to bring forth the leak.<p>Though derived from a chaotic and political mess, state actions (war plans, etc.) must be treated by the state as essentially sacred (and to go against it must be considered a ""high crime"").  Once in a while a person has the opportunity to see state actions through his/her individual moral lens and also feels empowered to act upon that feeling.<p>As misguided as that feeling often is, I think that its presence is a major force in the prevention of tyranny.",1280152270

What does this mean?<p>First, most of the SNPs are noncoding, found not in exons but in introns and intergenic space. Still, you can't dismiss these; some are causal for major gene expression changes (my lab has articles set to be published next week on this topic; more details then).<p>Second, the fact that you're only covering 1/3000 nucleotides tells you that there's no way you can fully specify someone's genetic risk with this data, ever. There is a debate in the community right now about whether common variants (which are on 23andme type chips) or rare variants contribute most of the genetic variability. I think it's clear that common variants are winning this game — but this is on a population level! On an individual level, I don't think I'd ever be comfortable telling someone their risk of X with just GWAS data. For the population, their rare/private mutation in Gene Y has little impact, perhaps, but for try telling that to the 5 people with the Gene Y mutation who will die by age 20. (Extreme hypothetical to try to drive home the broader point.)<p>Let's also not forget that phenotype is a computed expression of genotype+environment. If your genetic risk score from 23andme says you are at high risk of heart disease, yet your grandparents on both sides are 100 and healthy and your LDL-C is 60, should you really be concerned?",1280152021

I don't think the other characters were underdeveloped, they were just minor characters anyway. If his wife was a normal character, then it would seem like a normal film in terms of character development.<p>How do I know this? Well, what was the climax of the whole drama? When he confronts his wife's projection in the skyscraper near the end. That's when the most important/meaningful lines of the film are delivered, which are to the effect that dreamed characters/projections can never compare to the real thing, even in a very powerful imagination. That's why the film ends with him back with his kids and why we know he's not dreaming. He no longer wants his wife because she's a projection, but he wants his kids because they're real.

I think there is a difference between passionate advocate of a cause that requires some public leaks -- and being able to accept the consequences, and being an armchair, couch-potato anarchist.<p>Last night my youngest son and I watched ""Tora Tora Tora!"", the story of the attack on Pearl Harbor.<p>Back then, the United States had cracked the Japanese embassy codes. We were literally reading all their messages before they were.<p>This information -- that we had cracked the codes and what the traffic contained -- was limited to only 12 people in the entire government. After the president left one of the reports in a waste-basket, <i>he was taken off the list</i>.<p>Revealing even one of these messages would have been cause for long-term imprisonment. For a member of the military, sworn to protect the constitution, to release hundreds of thousands? I can't imagine any worse intelligence catastrophe. And that includes losing the A-bomb secrets.<p>The activist (or foreign intelligence service) has a cause and is will to suffer the consequences for using the information. The anarchist has only chaos as a cause. The activist selects what to leak, selects how to leak it, and sometimes dies for the revelation -- a fair penalty since leaking information can easily cause the deaths of others. The anarchist simply wants openness and lack of secrecy -- their enemy is reality itself, the fact that secrecy is necessary in some cases. A much more dangerous situation.",1280151377

Doing physical stuff was a welcome change from all this virtual work and I still do a lot of that on the side now to keep a balance in my life.<p>The wikipedia article is very dry, as a rule I list the sources of the stuff that I write and I took the list and expanded on it to put this in to context so that it becomes easier to see if you are at risk or not.<p>Writing about my personal experience is a different kettle of fish altogether, I'm not even sure if I am quite ready to document that phase of my life, it was not the most happy occasion.

Like I said, the only appealing quality of Swiss banking is its secrecy, and that is going away fast. How are Swiss banks going to be of any use to anyone that is not Swiss without their bank secret? It's a closed country, hard to reach, with no natural or other resources.<p>- Yes it's stable, but how is it any more stable than any other Western country? Besides like I already said it's very closed (the stability and closedness are intertwined, of course) - its internal stability has little value to anyone but the Swiss themselves.<p>- No the US doesn't have enough oil for its own use - my point is that at least it has some. I was contrasting it with Switzerland which has nothing (no offense to Swiss readers, I love hiking in your mountains so thanks for that ;) )<p>- You coastline argument is a red herring. A country that is basically a bunch of islands with irregular coastlines will of course have more coasts (but Greece has only a bit more than the US). Amount of kilometers of coastline is just a proxy for how much exploitable sea area that represents, and how much access it provides to the rest of the world for trade purposes, and the US crushes Greece on both accounts.<p>- Advanced technology: to paraphrase Charles Babbage (badly), ""I'm unable to comprehend the level of confusion that could lead to such statements"". Despite the sensationalist reporting and the high growth rates of China (and the rest of Asia) over the last 2 decades, China is still effectively a third world country. Its R&D capacity is below Western level and production capacity is highly concentrated in low-tech mass manufacturing like steel, clothing and electronics assembly. If you are serious in claiming that the Chinese have overtaken the West in technological development you'll have to come with proof of such claims, considering that all measures that would reasonably be used for such statements (GDP, R&D budgets, production in high-tech sectors, origin and ownership of leaders in the field, ...) solidly point to the US as world leader (with the EU as a second).<p>- I'm not sure what you're comparing by. GDP and consumption power are lower in Sweden, unemployment roughly equal, debt (as a ratio to GDP) is only a little bit below the US, and to get out of the near-bankruptcy state that Sweden was in in the early 2000's they had to significantly raise taxes yet cut in benefits. Not sure where you're going with this but Scandinavia being so much better is not a closed case as you try to make it seem.",1280151152

They are actually healthier for an economy, as the bad debts get written off, lending practices get rewritten, consumers and companies learn the dangerous side of debt.  Like a forest needs fire, economies need blow off periods where the bad decisions and investments get cleared off.<p>By shifting private losses to the public balance sheet, and producing shifty numbers which don't say 'depression', politicans dance around like project managers and keep the old codebase going.  But, as we all now, you eventually have to toss it all in the bin and get going again.<p>The negatives, of course, is that people will lose jobs, homes and all that goes with it.  The positives is that once you're bankrupt, you can't get any more bankrupt and can work your way back - this applies to companies and individuals.  Old industries and practices die, and new ones rise up to take their place.  It's the placing of old industries on life support that kill the economy in the long run.  Keeping GM on life support through public money diverts that money away from worthwhile investments (either public or private) and keeps subsidising a smaller group of people at the expense of society at large.<p>The damage is already done, and the chips need to lay where they fall.  Papering over the cracks with phony statistics and bailout after bailout will eventually fail with the same result, but it will take much longer to happen, and much longer to recover.<p>The irony in all this is that the only avenue left for governments (and being actively pursued) is inflation.  Money printing through quantitative easing is going ahead in big numbers.  Eventually all this fake new money will be lent out under fractional reserve by banks, and inflation will roar ahead.  The only people left standing after that will be the ones with real assets (housing, factories and machinery, farmland) bought with debt denominated in 2010 dollars.  People will turn off debt and onto saving just as savings become decimated by inflation.  The smart thing right now is to buy real, worthwhile assets with locked-in low interest rates and just ride out the deflationary period until the inflation spark catches in the tinder-dry monetary world.  It's quite likely that another stagflationary period will be with us in the next 10 years.<p>If you don't believe inflation will happen just tell me which paper currency is older than 150 years.

If the film wasn't already 2.5 hours, I imagine they would have given this likeable character more scenes. But essentially they <i>did</i> show you everything you need to know about this character, because her fingerprints were all over the set design of the rest of the film. Can't get much more visual-medium than that.<p>And then people say emotion draws you in deeper than ideas, but here we are days after watching the film avidly discussing its ideas (the layers of dreaming and how they worked). Meanwhile a film like The Matrix which does have 'stronger' individual characters to generate emotion, was compromised by a terrible oversight in the ideas department (ie. the whole concept of humans as batteries/generators is ridiculous). A film doesn't need to engage every level equally or in the standard way to be one of the best, IMO.<p>You mentioned flashback, well 90% of Inception after the first scene was a flashback, except in this case for once it wasn't at all contrived, because it represented the two characters (protagonist and Japanese dude) de-orphaning their current dream-state by reforming connections to previous layers (remembering the other dreams) and then they could snap back out of all the recursions. In other words, I think the storytelling was masterful.<p>And what's more, the film <i>was</i> deeply involved in character development and human/emotional themes, because most of it was essentially exploring peoples' subconscious minds and relating that to real life matters. The anchoring struggle was the protagonist 'coming back to reality' in the sense of someone gripped by guilt/regret and being lost in their own imagination at the expense of real relationships/progress (similar to the Solaris remake in this way). Sure, maybe people think this side of the film was poor, but if they'd at least <i>acknowledge/mention</i> it I wouldn't accuse them of missing the wood for the trees or regurgitating standard criticisms without thinking them through.",1280150004

1547892,comment,1547647,1547742,0,0,KlausTrainer,,,"> For me it's a 'yes' based on the simple rule that explicit is always better than implicit. That sort of 'optimisation' seems to be really cool when you're just starting out in a language but in the long run it isn't worth it.<p>I don't really get what you call implicit when you terminate statements with semicolons instead of linebreaks...\n... Ok, I get what you're hinting it: there are some (very) few exceptions. However, I cannot see where there is any 'optimisation' in using linebreaks instead of semicolons. You better need to explain why someone should use both linebreaks _and_ semicolons, when only using linebreaks is actually as good as well.<p>Basically, it's just a matter of style. Aside from a few exceptions (e.g. described in <a href=""http://inimino.org/~inimino/blog/javascript_semicolons"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inimino.org/~inimino/blog/javascript_semicolons</a>), linebreaks terminate a statement. If you stick with writing only one statement per line, I don't see what's so implicit with it. Rather terminating a statement both with a line break and a semicolon is a tautology, and hence introduces unnecessary redundancy.<p>The actual question is, whether one can require that developers know the (maybe a handful) exceptions where a line break doesn't terminate a statement. I have decided (for myself) that I can require that knowledge, as it really comes down to only a few exceptions (that I believe are easy to remember).<p>But, of course, I'm aware that one can also come do another reasonable conclusion.<p>The only important thing is that people make a concious decision about the issue at all. The importance of this increases with the number of people that are working together on a particular project.<p>Here a link to another article discussing that issue: <a href=""http://mislav.uniqpath.com/2010/05/semicolons/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mislav.uniqpath.com/2010/05/semicolons/</a>",1280149702

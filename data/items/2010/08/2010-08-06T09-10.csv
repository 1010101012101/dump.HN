Facebook can build so many apps, but they won't build them all.<p>This, I think, leads to the real litmus test for me: how sure are you that the company is 100% committed to being an open(ish) platform rather than building out its product?

Streets safe for children, people saying hello instead of staring from behind closed windows, etc.  Less local pollution, more friendly streets, less accidents : all pluses.<p>I just don't want to see some zealot telling me I can't have a car, and that I am some sort of evil person for having one.<p>Further, not everywhere is suitable.  Someone riding around cities near me have got high humidity and steep hills to deal with : you don't ride a bike without some serious fitness.  Those cruisy bikes you see in Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Cambridge are of no use.<p>What I'm saying : there should be no laws against this type of thing, and no laws saying you should do it.  Entirely personal choice all round.<p>For my part I have a large car but work from home, so it gets driven maybe once per fortnight.

I think disintermediation offers a way out of this - users should be able to take dynamic subsections from websites, filter and recombine them.

Integration with other services is on the todo list but for the time being I want to focus on the core features and user experience.<p>I think it can be useful without a large existing social graph.

The downside is I now get updates on anything they post when I only really want updates on the things they're working on.<p>As I said in a previous comment I think social network is the wrong label for this product. It's more of a group communication tool. The broadcast/follow model is a very efficient and useful way for groups to communicate and that's the core of of swytch.net - it's group communication with less noise and more signal.  Because it's not trying to be the 'one true network' it doesn't need a huge social graph.

With services moving out of private data centers and into the cloud, security tools are different from the arsenal used for internal apps; if you're an app guy deploying on EC2, you don't have a network security guy who's responsible for protecting your services. It's now your job to configure EC2 to protect your services, which is a small but significant difference. In terms of scanning for open ports, I think the main takeaway was that in distributed apps running off shared infrastructure, the basics often aren't followed by under pressure admins and devs. Memcached density was about 1 per 274 scanned addresses, which was higher than I'd have thought; it's apparently a mistake that's not uncommon.<p>Unfortunately it's often not good enough to point out open ports, and one needs to demonstrate exploitability. The main thrust of the talk was so say ""if you come across memcacheds, don't skip them, there's coolness there"". e.g. an open memcached used by Django directly equates to remote code exec due to Python's pickle.<p>You're spot on with the final point; firewall firewall firewall.<p>[fd: that's my name on the preso]",1281085318

62828,comment,62617,62776,0,0,jamesgolick,,,"Still, you can write your unit tests as you write your code.  All a unit test does is verify that your code behaves the way you want it to.<p>I think a lot of people here are confused about what exactly a unit test is.  When you write a unit test, you don't say: ""I want a bowling application, with such and such a scoring method, and such and such a pin layout"".<p>It's more like - ""I am writing a class (or portion of a class) here that's going to perform a certain function in my 'blue sky', exploratory phase project"".  If you don't know what your code is going to do, how can you really write it.  That is to say, exploratory coding isn't just typing random characters.  You have some ideas.<p>So, instead of just writing the first function/method/class/controller action/model, you write a test first, and watch it fail.  Then, you implement your method.  That way, you know that your method works.  <p>You really don't need to have an overall big picture of your application to write tests.  That view is more of a misunderstanding of testing than anything else.",1191453821

62823,comment,62617,62798,0,0,jamesgolick,,,"I think the problem that you might be facing is more related to the quality of your tests than testing itself.  If your tests are written correctly, you should never have to throw them away when you refactor. <p>In fact, that's one of the major benefits of testing: a refactoring safety net!",1191453439

62821,comment,62617,62665,0,0,jamesgolick,,,"I want to be clear in saying that the argument I was putting forth in this article was that you're already investing the time in testing your code, whether you test it by eye, or by code.  <p>The question for you is - Would you rather spend your time in your web browser/console & debugger, or your text editor writing code?  Clearly the latter has significant advantages , when it comes to reliability, etc, but if you're willing to forgo all of that, then you're really talking about where you want to spend your time.<p>Personally, I'd rather be in my text editor than my debugger (Okay, I don't have a debugger, since I write tests). My text editor is where I find my zone.",1191453286

5806423,story,,,3,2,ekinertac,"Attention  Turkish democracy needs you",,"After a series of peaceful demonstrations for preserving a recreational area in Istanbul city center which is planned to be demolished for the construction of a shopping mall, Turkish police attacked the protesters violently with tear gas, water cannon and a chemical gas called ""Agent Orange"" which is illegal to use, directly targeting their faces and bodies. Dozens of protesters are hospitalized and access to the park is blocked without any legal basis. Turkish media, either directly controlled by the government or having bussiness and political ties, refuse to cover the incidents. Press agencies also blocked the information flow. Please share this message for the world to become aware of the police state created by AKP of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, which is often considered to be a model for other Middle Eastern countries. Turkish democracy, our DEMOCRACY needs your help. Thank you! \n#occupygezi #direngezipark \nhttp://occupygezipics.tumblr.com/",1370127554

5806378,comment,5805186,5805186,4,0,mwcampbell,,,"I understand that attempting to write once, run everywhere doesn't make for a good user experience. For the best experience, it will probably always be necessary to develop a different front-end for each platform.<p>However, what does one do for logic that belongs on the user's 'device (i.e. client-side) and will be the same on all platforms? Especially considering that one of the targeted platforms may well be the Web.<p>One solution is to use the Xamarin suite for native targets, and something like Script# or JSIL for the Web. Of course, Script# and JSIL can only support a subset of .NET functionality, e.g. no shared-memory threads and therefore no blocking APIs (unless one of these compilers can transform code into continuation-passing style). Another possible solution is Haxe, which can compile to JS, Java, and C++ among others. The trouble with both of these solution is that when working on the Web version of the app, one has to know both the Web stack and the other language.<p>It seems to me that the best solution is to write all platform-independent client code in JavaScript, minimizing the use of browser APIs for that code (e.g. only XHR and setTimeout). Then, for the native mobile versions of the app, integrate a JS engine (note: not a web view), find or write stand-alone implementations of XHR and whatever other APIs one needs, then write the front-end in the native language for that platform.<p>Any thoughts on this? For native mobile apps, are we stuck rewriting <i>everything</i> in ObjC and Java, and maybe also writing a JS version for the web?",1370126812

The practice of saying ""namaste"" at the end of the session sounds like something you'd do to add a flavor of east meets west to make this practice cool/hip because in the context described in the article, it doesn't add much to the state of the individual aside from this cool ""namaste moment.""<p><i>""Choudhury holds a copyright for the 26 poses which constitute Bikram yoga under the same theory which allows choreographic sequences to be copyrighted.

When they do much more, it's towards R6RS compliance. R6RS adds a lot, but still nowhere near the full range of a full-package applications development language, much the same as your analogy of VC++ vs, say, C99. And as for Lisp, I guess I'm just used to saying Lisp and meaning Clisp, but any of the ""ready for app dev, with parens and prefix notation"" languages would fit here--e.g. Clojure--as they all take the approach that compromises in pure syntax are necessary to achieve practical usability.<p>So I think that's where Racket <i>is</i> apart from the Lisps and the Schemes: its core language is syntactically minimalist, as a Scheme, while it strives to have a vast standard library, as a Lisp.

Buff, and so on. Even on-camera flash for good wedding and event photography is normally the primary lighting indoors, since it can be controlled when the environmental (ambient) lighting can't be.

Demo: <a href=""http://quizlet.com/23770911/flashcards"" rel=""nofollow"">http://quizlet.com/23770911/flashcards</a><p>Our experience was that backbone was very helpful in laying out code and providing clean event triggering, but that a lot of it was simply too slow to use. We started out with a View per card, but that was impossibly slow with 100+ cards (and we need to support ~1000+). We ended up with just one view for the Card section, and a view each for the sidebar and options sections. That made it much faster, but also took away many of the benefits of backbone.<p>We also ran into significant speed problems with model gets and sets. Initializing the data for 200 cards (~10 attributes per card) took hundreds of milliseconds on Chrome and other browsers. We ended up using plain javascript objects for the hottest parts of that code.<p>Overall to us, backbone was probably worth it, but also cost us many long days of performance debugging, and we're still not 100% happy with it. For our next project we may try something else.",1370124071

Most of these photos at night suffer from noise and harsh flashes and significant redeye<p>2 - improving dynamic range in SLR by providing two photodiodes per each pixel. One for high sensitivity (large) and one for low sensitivity to preserve highlights.<p>3 - providing a great boost to the micro 4/3 systems. The 4/3 makes a great portable platform (size, weight, etc.) however suffers from tremendous shadow noise and as such make it less ideal as a replacement for full-frame (35mm sensors ) SLRs.<p>4 - might give a new life to Lytro and similar systems. It would allow them to provide higher resolutions images to make them appealing to more demanding phitographers.<p>5 - worst nightmare for people concerned with government intrusion. It enables cameras to operate in dark streets or other places and keep people under constant watch-day or night.",1370124060

At the highest levels, writing an iOS or Android app is like being a game developer and pushing the platform to its limits (in a non-hacky way). To attack the problem of smooth scrolling, ~60fps on a list (especially one doing async fetches and/or database and/or complex cell layouts) requires different experience and knowledge on each platform. To build a beautiful app (not an average app) on either platform, requires almost a craftsman-level touch and level of care. To attack the problem of data synchronization... don't go there (just use Parse)",1370124032

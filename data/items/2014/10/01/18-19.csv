8396882,comment,8393863,8394019,2,0,ris,,,"&quot;No-one is claiming that virtualization makes a system magically completely secure, but do people actually believe that it makes it less secure? (Compared to, running the same software on the same hardware using a single OS). I don&#x27;t think so.&quot;<p>However, common virtualized platforms such as EC2 encourage you to run your whole server setup in an environment where a (possibly malicious) neighbour could be running arbitrary x86 code in an instance on the same physical machine. This is not an attack vector that is remotely possible in the traditional, non-virtualized setup.",1412189992

Who cares? On a day-to-day basis I execute maybe 3% of the code paths in my editor<p>This is the Microsoft Office argument and the problem is that no one uses the same 3%. If they did, sure it&#x27;d be &quot;dead simple&quot;, by that of course I mean take many, many years of work. Sublime which attempts to do far less than we wanted to took 5 years to get to today and I&#x27;m not sure it really is a commercial success capable of supporting 3+ people.<p>> &quot;Programmers don&#x27;t pay for software&quot;. I&#x27;m sorry, but this is a poor excuse<p>It&#x27;s far from an excuse, it&#x27;s the truth. It doesn&#x27;t matter if developers as a class have a lot of money. They don&#x27;t actually spend it. I don&#x27;t know a single person who has ever personally paid for Visual Studio. Github is a service and the vast majority of their money comes from companies not individuals. How many people run stuff only on the heroku free tier?<p>Or here&#x27;s a direct example: when we launched the kickstarter people \\<i>freaked\\</i> out about us pricing it at $50. We had to drop it all the way to $15 and folks still complained endlessly about it. It is well known that short of a service targeted at companies, it is near impossible to sell developer tools. After all, it&#x27;s a group of people who look at a piece of software and say &quot;I can build that&quot;.<p>If there&#x27;s some secret, we&#x27;re missing it. There&#x27;s an entire organization [0] that has grown up around trying to help dev focused companies figure this stuff out. It&#x27;s led by James Lindenbaum (co-founder of Heroku, invested in us), he knows his stuff and he couldn&#x27;t figure out a way to make this work out either.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://heavybit.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://heavybit.com/</a>",1412189979

8396876,comment,8396356,8396621,1,0,jeffreyrogers,,,"I go to one of these elite schools and the primary benefit is in the connections you make. However, the worthwhile connections are generally only available to those who would have been successful regardless. For example, when I look at my friends who&#x27;ve landed the best jobs/internships they overwhelmingly got their interviews due to who they knew at the company already, which mainly came back to either who their parents knew (largely related to how wealthy their parents were) or what social club they were in (again, largely correlated with wealth).<p>So yes, the connections at elite schools are great, but they primarily serve to reinforce the same social structure that already exists. That said, there are certainly exceptions and it is possible to make these connections if you come from a less privileged background, but the odds are against you since you 1) don&#x27;t know where to look to make these connections and 2) aren&#x27;t like the people who you want to make connections with and so you&#x27;re less likely to connect in the first place.",1412189971

I&#x27;m of German descent (last name: Schroeder, 3rd generation in the US), but we have it very bad in comparison.<p>We have these parasitic institutions called &quot;for profit&quot; colleges that are typical capitalist greed. Their goal is to extract as much money out of students who can&#x27;t do math so well and end up with unbelievably large loans. Most state ran colleges are respectable, but the most all of the best colleges in America are private or private &quot;Ivy League&quot; colleges. Becoming a professor requires a PHD and many years to attain tenure. I simply don&#x27;t think the pay is competitive for public colleges vs private &quot;for profit&quot; colleges that are money making machines. Most of the best professors work for places you&#x27;ve likely heard of like Harvard, Yale, Princeton, etc. None of those are state colleges. That being said, some state colleges are wonderful (USC is a great example). It is just different, and unfortunately a lot less of a possibility for much of America&#x27;s working class.<p>US primary and secondary schools are mandatory and free, but college/university (no differentiation in the US) are becoming prohibitively expensive for all of the lower class and much of the middle class. It is bad.<p>The US has a few military colleges such as westpoint and the US Army War College, but those are only open to soldiers and officers, so are a different thing altogether.<p>Note that I work in technology and didn&#x27;t go to college. Not because I couldn&#x27;t afford it, but because after 4 years of military service, I was able to trivially get a job in technology. I get paid to write code.",1412189829

8396838,comment,8394339,8394339,1,0,pron,,,"Bay Area | Developer Evangelist | Parallel Universe (YC S12) <a href=""http://paralleluniverse.co"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paralleluniverse.co</a><p>Parallel Universe is building next generation server-side open source infrastructure software, which lets developers write simple code that is extremely performant and scalable. We believe while hardware architecture changed drastically almost a decade ago, software hasn&#x27;t caught up. Current software clashes with hardware, and requires more effort to be expended on scaling rather than on business logic. The problem is most severe in server-side software that ingests real-time data, and needs to respond to a very large number of concurrent requests at low latencies. It facilitates software that is harmonious with modern hardware -- with multi-core and multi-cache, with the storage hierarchy and the IO-to-processing ratio -- rather than software that fights the hardware at every turn. The result is applications that require far less hardware, while at the same time provide much greater performance and headroom for growth.<p>As a developer evangelist, your job would be to help drive adoption of the Parallel Universe stack. The job is a mix of marketing, coding, sales, and geeking out. On the job you will:<p>* Write demos and benchmarks, and blog about them<p>* Write introductory blog posts and tutorials<p>* Speak at (and organize) developer events and hosted tech-talks<p>* Study the problems facing potential users, and help direct our software to best address those problems<p>* Provide support and guidance on technical forums and social media<p>* Provide on-site support and guidance for customers<p>* Build and cultivate relationships with US companies<p>Requirements:<p>* Experience writing software for the JVM, especially in Java (knowing Clojure is a plus)<p>* Strong familiarity with modern server-side architectures<p>* Participation in developer communities<p>* Strong technical writing skills<p>* Public speaking experience<p>* Strong social skills and an outgoing personality<p>* Residence in the San Francisco Bay Area<p>You will work from home, but travel in the Bay Area (and occasionally in the rest of the US) to visit companies and participate in events. We offer a competitive salary (with benefits) and equity.<p>To apply, email jobs@paralleluniverse.co",1412189728

It will make it more difficult to interoperate, though.<p>Dropping the requirement to double-quote key names completely abandons JSON, though.<p>And once you do that, it is not at all clear to me what the point of this is. If you can&#x27;t parse it as JSON, you get no lift from JSON and you can&#x27;t use any existing JSON-based code, so why then accept the constraints of JSON?<p>A specification that used completely standard JSON with no ordering in the keys would make a lot more sense to me.<p>Further, were I going to do that, if I cared about order, I would use the construct in JSON that indicates order. It seems to me the natural sexpr -> JSON conversion for<p><pre><code>   (a b c (d e f))\n</code></pre>\nwould be<p><pre><code>   [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, [&quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;f&quot;]]\n</code></pre>\nas thrysus says, with an option on<p><pre><code>   [{&quot;type&quot;: &quot;quoted&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;x&quot;}, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;]\n</code></pre>\nfor special quoting forms and such. Or the quoted goes around the whole list or whatever makes sense.<p>All things considered, this proposal would require much more work before it could be useful to anybody; right now it tries to straddle two worlds and isn&#x27;t successful at either of them.

That&#x27;s not a huge difference. It&#x27;s a lot smaller than the difference in job opportunities.<p>Here&#x27;s the biggest (and underdocumented) advantage of having an elite pedigree: when you&#x27;re presumed smart, you can put 100% of your energies into social polish. You don&#x27;t have to (a) prove your intelligence, <i>and</i> (b) make the investor/patron feel important and just-slightly superior. You can focus on (b) alone, because (a) was taken care of. That&#x27;s a huge advantage, because you&#x27;re not serving two masters.<p>Within a couple hundred words of conversation, I can prove, to anyone intelligent, that I&#x27;m smarter than 90 to 99+% of the pedigreed (depending on how we define &quot;pedigreed&quot;) people out raising seed rounds, but it&#x27;s hard to do that without being a show-off and seeming like an arrogant prick.<p>It&#x27;s like the decorative swords that noblemen used to wear.

This is good for me and for the others. Even if the information artist guy made better visualizations, the people at the lab could blame him for not doing them as they envisioned, and the guy himself could not put the best of his effort on doing things, because they weren&#x27;t made directly for him, so the blame could would be probably justified.<p>But, well, it is better to step away from this world of giving responsibility to others and then blaming them, into a world in which everyone do their best and don&#x27;t blame anyone.

8396767,comment,8394381,8394381,10,0,EvanMiller,,,"The vision here is noble, and I applaud what Chris has done with Light Table, but based on the discussion here, I think the Eve team is setting themselves up for disappointment.<p>1. By bringing investors on board, and promising Hacker News they&#x27;re going to change the world, they&#x27;re basically asking to be stressed out all the time. This is not conducive to innovation.<p>2. There&#x27;s a fundamental tension between creating something usable by Joe in accounting and something that is cutting-edge from a technical perspective (highly concurrent etc). 90% of line-of-business programs use less than 10% of CPU, and approximately 0% need high concurrency. Joe in accounting is not going to build the next WhatsApp, and every moment you spend figuring out multi-core whatever, you&#x27;re not thinking about how to help Joe make his Cash Flow Prediction Tool look slick.<p>3. From a marketing perspective, creating a new category of software is an enormously difficult undertaking. There are two related problems here:<p>A. You have to find potential customers. Because nothing like Eve exists, the market does not exist. I.e. the world&#x27;s &quot;creators&quot; don&#x27;t all go to the same conferences, visit the same websites, and hang out in the same IRC channels. Light Table at least was addressing an existing market, i.e. &quot;programmers who use X/Y/Z&quot;, so you could actually <i>find</i> customers, and they could tell their programmer friends about it.<p>B. After you find potential customers, you have to educate them, i.e. explain the potential benefits and teach them how to use the darn thing. This requires a major investment from both you and from your interested customers. It is much, much easier to sell something that relieves the customer&#x27;s pain than something that promises him &quot;superpowers&quot;. 95% of &quot;creators&quot; have only vague and incorrect notions about programming, so you&#x27;ll have a hell of a time explaining the product. Let&#x27;s say you want to target Joe in accounting: What will the advertisement actually say? &quot;Do you miss VB6?&quot;<p>4. The fact that the LT team is giving up on Light Table when it&#x27;s still the proverbial &quot;couple of guys&quot; is not a good sign. From a marketing perspective, Light Table had every advantage in the world: tons of publicity / viral videos, a clearly defined market, and an exciting product that got people talking. The fact that they&#x27;re throwing in the towel tells me, well, they quit too early, and they&#x27;ll quit on Eve when the going gets tough.<p>To be more specific, I think Chris&#x27;s fears about the market for Light Table are totally unfounded. To wit:<p>* &quot;The competition has millions of man-hours invested&quot;. Who cares? On a day-to-day basis I execute maybe 3% of the code paths in my editor. In my view, Light Table is a classic opportunity to offer 10% of the functionality of the bloated competition but really knock that 10% out of the park. Look at e.g. Pixelmator versus Photoshop or [toot toot] Wizard versus SPSS.<p>* &quot;Programmers don&#x27;t pay for software&quot;. I&#x27;m sorry, but this is a poor excuse, and if I were your drill sergeant, and this were an 80s movie, I&#x27;d be screaming in your face right now. Programmers are a wealthy and growing segment. They&#x27;ll pay for stuff if it helps them get their job done (GitHub, TextMate, books, conferences, heck Visual Studio). Not only that, with the product&#x27;s positioning, you have a great opportunity to sell to people who want to be programmers, the &quot;ski pants&quot; market, if you will. If you read the comments in this thread, you&#x27;ll notice that your users are complaining about the Light Table&#x27;s lack of polish and they clearly recognize the need to pay someone to provide that polish.<p>In sum, I think the LT team should have worked themselves into a crying, bleeding, starving mess to make Light Table a commercial success, and then pursued bigger ideas once they had the business experience under their belt. Even if it took a few years, they&#x27;d be in a much better position both financially and psychologically to tackle a Grand New World-Changing Product once they had the routine down from their Small Life-Changing Editor.<p>As an indie-app-developer-whatever myself, I would kill for the kind of publicity and market opportunity that Light Table had. I wish Chris & Co. all the best with Eve, and I truly hope they succeed. But based on what I&#x27;m reading, I don&#x27;t think they don&#x27;t deserve to.",1412189138

Thanks!\n==<p>At Rails Machine, we all work from home - we have a “Remote First” culture. We are a Results-Only Work Environment, have a transparent and public technical ladder, unlimited time off, and require healthy work-life balance. Rails Machine pays 100% of health insurance premiums, participates in 401k match and has been bootstrapped and profitable since our founding in 2006. All employees participate in quarterly profit sharing.<p>As a Site Reliability Engineer at Rails Machine, your goals will be to ensure our customer’s applications are available, fast, and secure. Our customers need the best service, support, and products, and we need you to help us deliver.<p>At Rails Machine, we offer two main products: managed infrastructure and managed operations. Through managed infrastructure, we provide automation, infrastructure, and scalability in our own data center on our own hardware. We provide both bare-metal and virtualized hosting options for our customers, and you’ll work directly with them to ensure their goals are met through automation, analysis, and hardware.<p>Via managed operations, we provide custom, consulting-based solutions on top of AWS and other cloud vendors, as best meets our customer’s needs. You’ll manage globally load balanced AWS installations, cross-datacenter replication on different vendors, or within customer’s data-centers.<p>No matter the product, we take a DevOps-centric approach with our customers - we believe that we provide the best service and our customers get the best value when we work closely together. We integrate task trackers (Pivotal, Trello, Asana), chat (Slack, Hipchat), and source control (github) into our own workflow through careful and clever use of automation, giving our customers the ability to reach out to us like they would with an internal DevOps team but without an operational burden on us.<p>You’ll work with virtualization and container technologies like Xen, OpenStack, Vagrant, Ansible, and Docker. You will setup and automate high availability data clusters (MySQL Galera, PostgreSQL replication, Redis failover, ElasticSearch clustering, Memcached, MongoDB etc.), application instances for technologies like Ruby-on-Rails, Django, Node, and Scala (to name a few), and layer on top of those management, orchestration, monitoring, and alerting for fleets of instances. If you’ve ever wanted to work at a scale that few companies do, you’ll find the right challenge here at Rails Machine!",1412188950

While access to higher education IS an article of faith for the social democrats, there are additional factors in play here.<p>First, the German economy is dependent on a skilled labor force. As a result, Germany subsidizes tertiary education across the board, not just college. That&#x27;s not only to keep college accessible for the poor, but to encourage young people to get a solid, credentialed education.<p>Second, the usual expectation in Germany is that you&#x27;ll finish university with a graduate degree. In fact, until recently (per the Bologna Process) there weren&#x27;t even undergraduate degrees in Germany (as they provided less depth than a graduate degree and less practical experience compared to vocational training). The industry is generally interested in an MS over a BS, and having to pay for your tuition may force students to take a break after their Bachelor&#x27;s degree to earn some money.<p>Third, there&#x27;s the German attitude towards personal debt and loans (which is that they don&#x27;t particularly like either).

The resulting machine code will look fairly similar; if there is a performance difference, it would be far more subtle than your 10x, and would probably have to do with whether the map implementation in question is specialized for the Array->Array case.  One that is will allocate the right number of elements up front and perhaps even skip bounds checks that the compiler might or might not be able to optimize out from the explicit version, but one that isn&#x27;t will not only include bounds checks but repeatedly have to grow the result array and copy the elements so far to the new allocation.",1412187819

Some people argue that this is due to the high availability of student loans decreasing the pressure on universities to keep costs and tuition low.<p>This comes from the camp that believes that sticking kids with six digit debts right out of school is bad, unnecessary, AND that universities are needlessly wasteful. Eliminating the cost to the student entirely doesn&#x27;t seem like the answer to me either due to decreased incentive for students to pass their classes and decreased pressure to drive down costs at the university.

Eric Holder was sending a very strong message to the Ferguson community.<p>Remember, Ferguson Police and the St. Louis Police were the bad guys in Ferguson. The FBI came in with their Black leader (at the time: Eric Holder) and reassured the community that the African American President (and African American-led FBI) got their back.<p>Eric Holder then announced that the 40 Agents were going to hold an independent investigation and conduct a 3rd independent autopsy.<p>With the FBI&#x27;s arrival, the riots <i>immediately</i> stopped and trust was restored.<p>Now true, the Ferguson Police and St. Louis Police were _absolutely_ terrible. But the Federal response (specifically FBI&#x27;s under direct order of Eric Holder) was extremely effective and exemplary IMO.<p>Remember, we have a federal system in the US. Cities are independent of the county, counties are independent of the state, and states are independent of the nation. Eric Holder holds no responsibility for the poor behavior of Ferguson City cops or St. Louis County Cops. But... he was able to use the FBI&#x27;s influence to pressure the local cops to do the right thing.<p>Remember too: Eric Holder does not have the authority to prosecute Darren Wilson on murder or assault. The best the FBI can do is prosecute him (and the police department) on racism charges. Murder / Assault is a charge that can only be delivered from the local government in this case.

But, RPython was from the start &#x27;designed&#x27; as a language for implementing dynamic languages. The problem is that it took multiple iterations to identify meta-tracing as a foundation that works. And those iterations left some cruft here and there.<p>Compared to the Java-based experiments I did, sometimes I miss the ability to be explicit about types, and have to use RPython&#x27;s assertions instead, which is a clumsy way of telling RPython about types. But overall, RPython isn&#x27;t the worst toolchain I have ever worked with. And, typically, if the error messages are really bad, the community is very helpful and eager to improve them.",1412186967

I have about 30 minutes a day of support workload during the week, and rarely anything on weekends. 2-3 days a week I&#x27;ll spend a few hours working on whatever&#x27;s next on my TODO list of new features, improvements, architecture upgrades and refactoring. I have a small (<$1000/mo) budget for ads, do no outbound sales, and the vast majority of new signups are referrals from existing users, whether word-of-mouth or via blog posts, tweets, etc.<p>* W3Counter (<a href=""https://www.w3counter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.w3counter.com</a>) has ~78,000 users now with 99.5% of them on the free plan. It generates a few thousand a month in subscriptions and a few hundred a month in ad revenue via BuySellAds. I haven&#x27;t invested any development time into it since a redesign in February, and had a grand total of 5 e-mails for support last month. I don&#x27;t market the site at all. It&#x27;s very much passive income -- keep the servers up and everyone&#x27;s happy.<p>* I started investing my savings in the stock market when the recession began and everything was cheap. That&#x27;s yielded a 35% return so far plus dividends. I put aside some money to gamble on individual stocks, but most of it is in Vanguard index funds (total stock market, total bond market, dividend growth fund). A portion of each month&#x27;s savings go into that, buying and never selling.<p>-----<p>A lot of what&#x27;s made Improvely & W3Counter work so well and be so low-maintenance were learned through things shared on HN, which I&#x27;m eternally thankful for. Here&#x27;s some of what I found most important for SAAS:<p>* Onboarding is super critical. It&#x27;s all about guiding new users to &quot;activation&quot; ASAP, which means finishing whatever they need to do to get value from the service. To me, that means the first thing they see after signup is a walkthrough that very clearly tells them what steps to take to get started with their new account, and a set of automatic e-mails to gently remind new users about steps that haven&#x27;t finished yet. Screens are never empty even if there&#x27;s nothing to show yet -- show demo data, or a message with next steps to make that screen work, always.<p>* Track metrics that matter, not vanity metrics. I have no idea how many page views any of my sites had last month, or what their bounce rates were. I do know how much MRR changed, what the churn rate was, and what direction customer LTV is going.<p>* Someone whose credit card was declined isn&#x27;t a lost customer. Have a good dunning process -- my users get an e-mail after 1 days, 3 days later, 7 days after that, asking to update their card on file. It&#x27;s almost two weeks after the initial billing failure by then, and usually whatever the cause (insufficient funds, waiting on a new card to come in the mail, etc) is resolved by then and the subscription isn&#x27;t lost.<p>* Someone who cancels isn&#x27;t gone forever. People have financial issues, get too busy to use the service, are in the midst of changing jobs or winding down a business, trying alternatives, or a million reasons other than not liking your service. Reach out in a few months with a discount and they might come back. A lot do.<p>* A few FAQs go a long way. So do a few sentences of explanation/help on the screen itself, or tooltips on jargon/acronyms some users might not be familiar with.<p>* Pricing matters a lot. Try different pricing schemes, you&#x27;re probably charging too little. Optimally, your pricing tiers should be tied somehow to the value you create for users so that your revenue grows as your customers&#x27; businesses grow. Your customer LTV from customers you&#x27;ve already acquired goes up every month, while they still get more value from the product than they&#x27;re paying -- everyone&#x27;s happy and growing together.<p>* Don&#x27;t outsource or compartmentalize support if you can help it. Answer e-mails yourself for as long as possible. The most consistent feedback I&#x27;ve gotten the past 2 years is how much people are surprised and delighted to get a same-day reply to their e-mail from someone that understands their technical question. If you go above and beyond with support, you&#x27;ll win customers for life.<p>Recommended reading:<p><a href=""http://www.groovehq.com/blog"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.groovehq.com/blog</a><p><a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/greatest-hits/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/greatest-hits/</a>",1412186887

8396493,comment,8394136,8396108,6,0,rbehrends,,,"Well, there are a number of reasons.<p>First of all, you won&#x27;t actually get to learn German for free. In order to be admitted, you&#x27;ll need to already speak Germany at a B2/C1 [1] level of fluency. This is probably the biggest obstacle: if you aren&#x27;t already fluent, you won&#x27;t learn a foreign language overnight, and if you are, you&#x27;ve probably already considered studying in Germany.<p>Second, if you&#x27;re American, your high school diploma generally isn&#x27;t enough to be admitted. The requirements are a high school diploma AND a 3.0+ GPA AND either a SAT score in Math/Critical Reading of 1300+ or an ACT of 29+ (successful AP courses or college experience can lower the requirements or substitute for them).<p>Third, you may not be eligible for financial assistance; even without tuition to worry about, you still need to feed yourself, have a roof over your head, and pay for health insurance (though health insurance for students is less than €80/month). Finding a job can also be difficult (even as an EU citizen, language skills and cultural differences may stand in the way of employment; non-EU foreigners usually are even more limited in their options).<p>Why does the German government keep tuition free for foreign students? First of all, the costs of running a university are mostly fixed costs and especially in STEM subjects, German universities are running below capacity; second, students that meet the requirements (fluent in German, generally capable of supporting themselves, interested in studying abroad) are sufficiently likely to stay after they&#x27;ve gotten their degree: they&#x27;ll be valued high-skill immigrants who&#x27;ll contribute to the economy and probably pay more in taxes later than they received in free tuition.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.daad.de/deutschland/studienangebote/sommerkurse/en/15297-common-european-framework-of-reference/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.daad.de/deutschland/studienangebote/sommerkurse/...</a>",1412186832

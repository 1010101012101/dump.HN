My hosting service is site44, which is simple dropbox hosting so i don&#x27;t have to setup a server. The rest of it is just js/html/less files. I used bootstrap for the styling and jquery/google maps API for everything else.<p>I did do some pre-processing on the data in python to geocode the locations (ie: change the street addresses to long/lat coordinates). I used geopy to do that, and pandas to manage the data.<p>The total product took me three days to build and design",1386410106

Back then, the school had little brand, but I still got hired by Groupon, and <i>not</i> in a junior role.  I was a liberal arts major.<p>Since that time, I&#x27;ve seen demand for students of later cohorts grow and grow.  Some have gotten into white hot start-ups like famo.us, Google and Yahoo! offered interviews to practically the entire current graduating class.  One of my friends who started right after me is leading Keychain Logistic&#x27;s front-end development (YC2012).  More interestingly is that while we learn Node, Meteor, Backbone and a lot of other JS-related technologies, a large number of formerly non-technical students have gone on to take roles that have little to do with JavaScript.  A couple of examples I can think of off the top of my head are senior Java developer at Pandora and chief data scientist at Node Prime.  I really can&#x27;t emphasize strongly enough what 800 hours in 12 weeks can do in the right program.<p>My biggest concern with what I can see of the Omaha Code School is actually the low price tag.  These schools are not commodities with roughly similar pros and cons.  There is a <i>huge</i> variance in outcomes and if you&#x27;re going to put your life on hold for months while spending all your waking time investing in a new career, it would be madness not to invest in the highest quality program you can.",1386409341

6866038,comment,6850675,6865007,2,0,tommorris,,,"I reject the premise that stability is the opposite of success. For some people, having a stable home life might be a condition of their success.<p>Again, it rests on a gendered notion of support and a traditional model of marriage/relationships, which a lot more people reject these days. I&#x27;m currently single, but let&#x27;s say I were to get into a fairly serious relationship in the next few weeks such that new partner moved in with me: would that mean that my work life would now change to be less concerned about success? No. They&#x27;d presumably have a job too. Difference is when I got home at the end of the day, there&#x27;d be a friendly, kind, loving companion to care for me.<p>Having a dual income supporting the household means that in that particular case, I can be less concerned about stability - because making rent and paying bills and so on is a lot less of a struggle.<p>In the long-term, it might change if one were to have kids, but having kids and getting married are not the same thing. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to have kids until I reached a certain level of success and financial independence (and, hey, one of the benefits of being gay: no unplanned pregnancies!) but that&#x27;s separate from the question of having a relationship or not, or even getting married or not.<p>This is why I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s outdated advice rather than sexist advice: it presumes a model of marriage and relationships that has changed (incidentally, contrary to the views of anti-gay social conservatives, it was mostly changed by straight people unhappy with the previous arrangements). Most of the people I know - straight or gay - spend a lot longer living together before getting married. And they tend to delay having children or opt-out of childbearing altogether. How are people in long-term childless unmarried relationships &quot;tied down&quot; exactly? How does whether I go home to an empty apartment or an apartment with a boyfriend in it change whether or not I can be successful at work?<p>Think of it like a partnership in business: a successful partnership means the partners can do more together than they could do apart (provide services to bigger clients, say, or have more capital to invest). But there might be a partnership where one partner works very hard, produces a lot of value and the other mooches off their success without doing much. Saying that a romantic relationship leads to people being tied down and stepping away from risk in business is a bit like saying all business partnerships are of the latter rather than the former kind. Some relationships enable both parties to flourish more than they would separately.",1386409197

Yes, some of us have been known to hang out in very pro-patent echo chambers as well.<p>> The concepts of a Person of Ordinary Skill and Doctrine of Equivalents is not &quot;black boxes&quot;.<p>Complete non sequitur.  A black box is a device where the function is known, but not its workings.  If something is a black box, it&#x27;s hard to see how it would satisfy the &#x27;enablement&#x27; standard.  Well, unless it&#x27;s black box software, then it&#x27;s just fine!  Judges apparently think that you just tell the computer what to do and it requires no undue experimentation.  So you just need someone to come up with the brilliant idea to patent software that simulates the human brain and achieves sentience (or at least passes the Turing test) and everything thereafter is just a matter of typing it in once this disclosed. Yes really, see [1].<p>> Studies [1, 2], albeit with only publicly available data, have found no empirical evidence of a &quot;modern patent trolling crisis&quot;<p>They apparently haven&#x27;t read the newspaper, either, wherein we find that every major tech company is apparently a thief, in spite of the fact that nobody actually reads patents (we&#x27;re all warned not to, treble damages and all that).  Interestingly, widespread reinvention of a patent is <i>not</i> considered empirical proof of obviousness, rather it proves that the idea was really valuable and the patent holder deserves lots of money for discovering that, say, cell phone computers can do email just as well as other computers.  Also, we&#x27;d best not look at the steadily increasing number of patent cases, nor all of the goings on in Marshall, TX.<p>> &quot;Machines are made of metals which occur in nature, which are SCOTUS identified ineligible subject matter.&quot;<p>You&#x27;re confusing &quot;contains&quot; with &quot;is&quot; here.

Apparently they don&#x27;t realize that software is <i>information</i> and that numbers are no different than any other form of information.  And, as with your broken logic, we can say that hardware contains information [software], but it&#x27;s quite ridiculous to say that hardware <i>is</i> information.<p>> I&#x27;m genuinely curious: how do you judge the quality of a patent?<p>By how much of it is actually new.  If someone comes up with a new computing device, some idiot will try to patent having it do email, web surfing and everything else we already know that computers can do.<p>> When we first mined metals, we have done so expecting to make things out of them. Using a metal for its expected and customary use is not subject to patents beyond the patents on the metal itself.&quot;<p>We can actually enumerate all of the programs that can go on a particular computer.  It&#x27;s the set of integers from zero to the largest number that would fit in memory (most of these are not useful, however).  I don&#x27;t believe you can do that with all things that could be made of metal, moreover the metal&#x27;s properties are altered in certain combinations (e.g. amalgams) whereas the computer&#x27;s properties are not altered by the information on it--the computer is still performing an instruction loop over the data it contains.<p>[1]  This is a real howler for programmers, found quoted on Patently O:  Fonar Corp. v. General Electric Co., 107 F.3d 1543, 1549, 41 USPQ2d 1801, 1805 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (“As a general rule, where software constitutes part of a best mode of carrying out an invention, description of such a best mode is satisfied by a disclosure of the functions of the software. This is because, normally, writing code for such software is within the skill of the art, not requiring undue experimentation, once its functions have been disclosed. * * * Thus, flow charts or source code listings are not a requirement for adequately disclosing the functions of software.”).",1386407400

The company is mostly made of C++ guys (lots of game and sim dev), but we have recently started on some web projects and we seem to have no idea how to evaluate interviewees.<p>Personally, I am a recent grad (last May), but have focused on web dev in my free time. However, having gone through formal CS I do know a good bit about the low level data structures and bitwise operations. Some of the interviewees have been developing for over a decade and can&#x27;t say what a linked list is, let alone contrast it with vector or an array.<p>It is all, anecdotal, but we&#x27;ve seen a fair amount of correlation between ability to solve simple problems (writing simple functions with no expectation of optimization) and knowledge of these entry level CS topics. So as much as I feel like we are testing for the wrong things when we ask about simple bitwise operations or linked lists when interviewing for front-end JS guys, it has still been a good test for us.<p>All of that being said, this post is definitely well written and interesting. It is odd to me that an author who seems interested in learning and trying something new would so actively choose not to know what the code he&#x27;s writing (and telling the reader to write) is doing.",1411919732

What is the incentive to be a content creator on Quora?<p>AFTER EDIT: Aside about the other comments wondering if Hacker News has a no-humor rule. I find comments from time to time on Hacker News that are laugh-out-loud funny. I&#x27;ll link to two examples to show what I mean, after noting that a good humorous comment on Hacker News is still the same thing as a good nonhumorous comment on Hacker News: a comment that is &quot;thoughtful&quot; both in the sense of being civil and in the sense of providing food for thought in the context of the discussion thread. One recent Hacker News comment that I thought was so funny, and so thoughtful, that I shared it on my Facebook wall (where it was liked by several of my friends) was by patio11 about Yahoo&#x27;s business plans after the Alibaba IPO.[1] A much older comment that I cherish from years ago was about how lifestyles in Japan changed after the &quot;lost decade&quot; of meager economic growth in the 1990s.[2] You can be humorous on Hacker News and get upvotes (evidently) if you embed your humor in a substantive comment.

8380011,comment,8378799,8378799,4,0,jhallenworld,,,"It is interesting to implement syntax highlighters- to solve the problem of making them fast and efficient.  In JOE, I save the continuation of the syntax highlighter parser for the beginning of each line.  When the user changes the file, the file is re-parsed beginning with the continuation at the start of the line.  Parsing stops early if the resulting continuation at the beginning of some subsequent line matches the saved value.<p>JOE&#x27;s highlighter supports recursive calls: for example to switch syntax to a scripting language embedded in HTML.  Originally I implemented this with template instantiation of the sub-syntax.  Recursion is allowed, but to a limited depth: the advantage is that the state can still be represented as a single number.<p>Later, this was replaced with a real call stack.  It turns out that the call stacks of the saved continuations are often identical (stated another way- there is already an identical continuation, so when there is a call, we search for and reuse it if found).<p>The continuation also includes a buffer for saved data (for example for here document delimiters). The continuation ends up being 32 bytes on 32-bit machines:<p><pre><code>  struct highlight_state {\n          struct high_frame *stack; /* Closure */\n          int state; /* Program counter */\n          unsigned char saved_s[24]; /* Local data */\n  };\n</code></pre>\nAnyway, it&#x27;s at least conceptually straightforward to extend this to have any kind of state.  Also, it should be possible to compile the syntax parser to the native machine code.  Even so, the interpreted implementation is quite fast.  Fast enough that there has not been a need to try to run it asynchronously or after a delay as in some other editors.",1411919248

Say the language you&#x27;re using creates an entirely new list whenever you try to remove an element from the middle of a list - or when you need to be moving / removing elements all over the place.<p>The big downside of such a linked list is that you can&#x27;t easily jump to a specific item number in the list.  So jumping to item 200 means walking through the first 199 elements in the list to find it.<p>I&#x27;ve only had to implement a linked list once in a JS project, I don&#x27;t remember the reason why.  I think the algorithm just worked a lot more efficiently that way.<p>One reason a linked list could be useful in a javascript (or PHP, or whatever) language would be, for instance, if you had a game where when a player hit a block with a hammer, that block would bounce up and down, as would the two blocks on either side.  If you store all the blocks in a regular list, then you need to know the index of the block in order to find the blocks on either side.  In a linked list, you don&#x27;t.<p>One of the original big advantages of linked lists is that you can have objects of variable size, and the list can grow and shrink without adjusting any of the previous elements.  Opposed to this is an `array` (sometimes called a vector) which is a fixed size chunk of memory which is split up into identical sized parts.  You can then jump to element 200 by looking at the starting position + 200 * the size of a single element.<p>This works pretty well, but if you want to add another 20 elements into the middle of the array, you need to allocate a new chunk of memory and move the whole lot into it, and deallocate the previous entire array.  This is one of the reasons why strings are usually immutable in many languages.  Strings are stored as arrays, not linked lists of letters.<p>I think it&#x27;s worth learning about all this &quot;Computer Science&quot; stuff, even if you don&#x27;t need it very often, as it means when you come across a new problem you have a much bigger mental toolkit from which to figure it out.",1411918925

This is the same as saying &quot;sorry if you didn&#x27;t go to a top CS college to have smart developers friends. There is nothing you can do&quot;. Sam Altman in his last startup class went as far as to say that non-tech people have no business founding a tech business, quoting &quot;software people should found software companies, media eople should found media company&quot;. I found that a little bit sad to hear.<p>Anyway, my advice. Start with &quot;freelance-as-a-test-to-CTO contract&quot;. But the secret is to find a developer who is not a freelancer. Freelancers already made their mind, they don&#x27;t want to be a CTO, they will treat your contract as any other job, probably not even prioritize yours.<p>You must find a non-freelancer developer with an interest to start a start-up. Maybe a guy with a dayjob who needs the paycheck and can&#x27;t afford to quit it, or some other who already failed in one or two of his own ideas. Or a young smart developer who is still lookong for his idea of a startup.<p>Finding the right profile, you must deal with the agreement the right way. You must convince the developer that your idea has the potencial to be big. You must value his time and pay a reasonable fee. I think the right one won&#x27;t charge the top market he would if he was a freelancer. He <i>must</i> gain other thngs than money with the job. Learning mostly. Learning about a code, as he will build a software from scratch, probably learnng new tech. Also learning how a business is built. If it fails he must be better prepared to startup his own thing, for example. That is the hard thing to get with freelancers. They will accept your proposal only for the money. You will never know if they are really interested in being part of your business for real. This is become a 100% certainty if you are outsourcing to a software factory or remote freelance, so don&#x27;t even consider about it.\nI would start with an hourly fee, i think it is better for a test than a fulltime hire. Sometimes might be even irresponsible to hire a developer to such an only-idea startup. Too risky.<p>Hire the guy to make the MVP with an hourly fee. This way you will know if the guy is good, if you work well together, if you cmmunicate well. He will also know if it is something he wants to dive in. So this would be the freelancer as a test to CTO.<p>Now, actualy answering the qustion to where find it. I don&#x27;t believe in startup events or regular networking for this. You hire the more outspken and available developer, not the right one. A good tip that worked for me is to keep an eye for this guys that show up at HN front page with a technical post or a Show HN. Rule out the very experient and famous developers who are regulars to HN front page. Search for the new, unknown guy who did something bright (HN upvotes are a great filter from tech guys for this). At the Show HN rule out the full formed startups, look, again, for the new, unknown guy who built something great as a side project.<p>If you have experience in the field, a good idea and money to fund (and a willingness to go to SV), i think you are in good position to attract the top talent that appear here.<p>Also, look for someone in &quot;Who is hiring&quot; Hn thread (<i>definitely not</i> at &quot;Needs a freelancer?&quot; thread).",1411917525

He&#x27;s a guy giving talks called &quot;Linux sucks&quot; in which he basically bashes Linux for 20 minutes and then concludes that Linux is the best FOSS OS community because they can take the bashing (get it?). He&#x27;s been giving these talks for quite a while now. Everybody knows Theo de Raadt is crazy (and Stallman isn&#x27;t) and of course everybody knows Apple fanboys tear up every time somebody implies Apple software has a bug in it.<p>In my experience it&#x27;s the exact opposite. I&#x27;ve been hearing a lot of explanations for the bash debacle in the last couple of days and they all amaze me to a certain degree. Let me share a couple of them with you.<p>1. Total breakdown - &quot;No software is ever safe, so what the hell do you want from me.&quot; Yeah, well ... don&#x27;t write software then.<p>2. It&#x27;s not my fault - &quot;Bash is written in C. C is unsafe.&quot; Quite a lot of people write safe, well tested, maybe even formally verified C code. So, yeah ... don&#x27;t hack in C maybe.<p>3. Linux is still fine - &quot;Bash is just a tiny part of Linux. The rest is still good to go.&quot; Turns out the bash codebase looks a lot like the rest of the GNU/Linux universe. Old, untested C code that&#x27;s hard to read and even harder to understand. That&#x27;s why nobody dares to touch it in the first place.<p>4. It&#x27;s FOSS - &quot;You can&#x27;t expect anything to work. Cause, you know, it&#x27;s free.&quot; If that were true, using FOSS would be a terrible idea.<p>5. You&#x27;re using it wrong. ... just wow.<p>Can&#x27;t we just all agree that this kind of thing is an endemic problem in most of the code bases we use (including my beloved FreeBSD) and we have to figure it out over the next couple of years. There are loads of tools that should have never been implemented in C/C++ in the first place (SSH, Make, APT, etc.). I&#x27;d say the best idea is to port a lot of these code bases to languages like Go or Rust maybe, but if that&#x27;s not feasible for some reason, at least write some unit tests and do static code analysis. And, this is probably the most important point, if you don&#x27;t want to do any of this, please don&#x27;t make lame excuses when it all falls apart eventually.",1411917441

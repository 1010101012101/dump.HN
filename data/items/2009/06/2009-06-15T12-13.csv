658298,comment,658099,658099,0,0,kragen,,,"The same thing happens between the armies of nations.  Nation A's army attacks the civilians and army of Nation B; Nation B's army attacks the civilians and army of Nation A.  Even though they're fighting each other, the civilians on both sides are very similar to each other, and the war makes them all worse off through taxation and slaughter.<p>The armies are also very similar to each other, in values and in training, and very different from the civilian population. In fact, they probably trained together in joint exercises or at WHISC before the war.<p>If you slice the identities one way, the attacks by the armies on the civilians show that the armies are dangerous to the civilians, and therefore civilians should endeavor to eliminate armies, as did the people of the United States in the American Revolution, and as did the people of Costa Rica during the previous century. But of course the more common way to look at it is that the attacks by Nation A show the great necessity for the civilians of Nation B to support the army of Nation B, in order to deter and defend against attacks from Nation A, and vice versa.<p>So armies, as a class, whip up support for themselves by attacking and killing the civilians whose support they depend on.<p>And so today in Israel and Palestine, each nation has strong popular support for organized violence against civilians on the other side.<p>Of course, historically the connection between armies and governments is extremely close.<p>Is there a way out?  Are the Costa Ricans in imminent danger of invasion due to their lack of armed forces? Having armed forces didn't seem to help the Salvadorans, the Guatemalans, or the Nicaraguans when the US funded terrorist campaigns against their people, didn't help the Panamanians or the Granadans when the US decided to invade them, and didn't help Guatemala when the United Fruit Company organized a coup.  In fact, in most of those cases, the army acted against its own people.<p>But would Honduras have avoided the Football War if they had had no army? Or would they now be a province of El Salvador?  Would Cuba be a territory of the US, like Puerto Rico? (And would Cubans be better off if they were?)",1245069931

658296,comment,658093,658093,0,0,jlangenauer,,,"I think the thing that needs to be realised is that online collaboration is not merely the same as file sharing - particularly in the construction industry.<p>It's only at certain small parts of the overall construction process (from design through construction and then commissioning) that ""collaboration"" can be reduced to distributing files: typically where the files in question are ""Issued for Construction"" or ""Issued for Review"" - the formal gates in the process.<p>The rest of the time, as the documents are developed, and interpreted, collaboration (particularly in an online sense) means that additional information needs to be conveyed with the drawings to provide context and/or revision without the formal issue of a new revision of a drawing or document, or even a redline markup.<p>Some examples of these sorts of situations:
- Where as-built changes (i.e. where changes have been made on site from the ""approved"" drawings) need to be incorporated into drawings which are then handed over with the completed project
- When a drawing needs to be clarified between site and the design office.
- Where a contractual clause needs to be varied on a subcontract, because both parties agree it might be mutually beneficial to do so.
- Where a initial draft of a drawing needs to accept the input from multiple engineering disciplines in order to produce a final drawing.<p>These situations - which are, by far, the most common type of situations in construction - are ones where the transfer of documents is insufficient to communicate the context and changes which another person needs to understand to provide input. These are the situations where email comes into its own on the construction project - particularly if done through a document control system so the audit trail is established.<p>I think the future of construction collaboration will look a lot more like Google Wave than DropBox. Until then, email will hold an important role in any construction project - despite it being a shitty medium to share controlled documents, but because it can surround those documents with further information and context in the easiest way possible.",1245069777

658287,comment,658221,658283,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"From the concluding paragraph:<p><i>This is pure -- and premature -- speculation. But it is not speculative to observe that some vertical fins are weaker than they should be, and that this is because of the regulations that govern how airplanes are built. The FAA, together with its international counterparts, should amend certification requirements for future aircraft to restore to the maneuvering speed the safety status that pilots always believed it had. The rules that govern the structural integrity of airliners should not include asterisks.</i><p>Peter Garrison has a long history of writing and editing aviation pieces. He's written a fair number of accident reports for the aviation community. He understands the nature of premature speculation. He made the call that this issue is important enough to use the crash as a vehicle to bring up.<p>I agree.<p>The purpose is not to speculate on the crash, provide closure to the crash victims or relief to the air crews. The purpose is to bring up a regulatory issue that needs further attention. In this case, I think it's a worthwhile cause. In 99% of the other stories, I did not.

658286,comment,657119,657119,0,0,FrankBlack,,,"According to the notes from a hearing held in February 2008, the average cost for textbooks in the State University of New York system (SUNY) is $900 per year.  If we are conservative and say that $300 of those $900 dollars are for things that cannot be easily replaced (lab books, workbooks, CDs, unique books, etc.) that still amounts to $2400 over the course of four years that could be saved if the text books were made Open Source.  For that price the student could buy a laptop capable of everything they'd need over four years at school (a Macbook with bumped up memory and Apple Care protection plan is around $1200 after the student discount, Dell would likely be less for a comparable configuration) and a Kindle and still have money left over for beer.

This within certain limits is probably true--and in Governments of a Monarchical cast, Patriotism may look with indulgence, if not with favour, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the popular character, in Governments purely elective, it is a spirit not to be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain there will always be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose--and there being constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be, by force of public opinion, to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched; it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame, lest instead of warming, it should consume.""<p>GEORGE WASHINGTON, Farewell Address to the people of the United States, Sep. 17, 1796",1245068913

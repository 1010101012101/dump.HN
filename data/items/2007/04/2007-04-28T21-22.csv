Even if they don't initially, they quickly become good.  So, in empirical sense, using Lisp as one filtering factor can work.  (But be aware: The fact that they can write good Java code doesn't mean they want to do so).",1177794681

Kyro - what you're saying makes a lot of sense, but you're working under different assumptions than I.  Sppose you chose random groupings from the set of all YC funded founders, and give them a random idea from set of all initial ideas, the resulting companies might be different, but the ratio of successes will stay the same.  (Assume everyone is equally good friends, etc.)<p>The launched YC companies all built the company, including all the ""atmosphere, communities, ease of use, value, services, etc."" in three months or so.  Again, any random pairing of YC funded founders could have done this.  For example, I don't think any random pair of founders could run a successful MEMS foundry, which requires specific knowledge.<p>So, now, I read the question as what's different about the <i>founders</i> and not, the <i>company.</i>",1177794501

17766,comment,17674,17681,0,0,ryan,,,"""When I was in Architecture school, all of my professors tried to convince us students that there were no new ideas, everything had been done. That nothing great was created/designed/invented by individuals, it was all thanks to groups. That the heroic in architecture was impossible and undesirable. That Wright's Falling water was banal, just a bunch of concrete plates stacked up above each other. All of this foolishness was washed away when I worked for Paul Rudolph in NYC who single handedly was designing some of the most beautiful and heroic buildings I had ever seen. The experience saved my world view of what is possible.""<p>Have you read The Fountainhead by any chance? :)",1177794257

That's why I'm asking about others' opinions. Why is everyone so quick to say girls tend to be bad programmers, but gay programmers are a touchy subject?<p>This is not a troll. I'm just stimulating a discussion that AFAIK has never taken place before.<p>Thanks",1217660386
264841,comment,264750,264750,0,0,phd2000,,,"It all depends. If you want to get your programs on carrier decks you are either going to have to learn J2ME (Java) or Brew. Java powered phones are by far the most popular, including all Nokias, S-E, and RIM Blackberry models.<p>However, I think the iPhone platform is the future. You have a distribution model that bypasses the carrier decks with iTunes. Which is huge because it's a pain in the ass to get on carrier decks, seeing how most NA phones are locked from installing software unless you download it directly from the carrier's portal. Then you have the fact that Apple users tend to open their wallets more for software.",1217660072

There are some things that are just not possible...Except for the C++ part, which is the native language and thus has almost complete access to the system.",1217659946

264834,comment,264808,264808,0,0,sown,,,"Vacuuming a hotel is a fundamentally different engineering problem than vacuuming a house in a similar way that a dish washer for a restaurant is different than for a home. The washer from where I worked was a large industrial box that worked hard and fast. A home unit would have to conserve energy and water where as the industrial unit doesn't necessarily. Customers need clean dishes NOW more than the business needs to save some single-digit percentage in energy and water costs.<p>Speed, capacity and throughput come into play.<p>I only need to clean 1 living quarters where as a maid service in a hotel has to do dozens, every day. The roomba would have to be at least as fast as the human and it is not. That's OK for home use since I'm at work so it can take all day if it wanted to. That wouldn't work out so well at a hotel where throughput matters more.<p>This sounds like an interesting problem for someone in operations research to tackle. I can conceive that a roomba might be useful in a hotel (for example, when the cleaning staff is going at the bathroom, let the robot loose in the room) ... but it would require some time and money to study it.<p>Perhaps a system where the floor has embedded RFID tags with unique serial numbers to help make the robot's job easier and more efficient, and a larger capacity bin and battery.<p>I'm sure iRobot is thinking about this.",1217659320

I've seen enough of that in the real world and I've grown tired of seeing it on the Internet, where most people have no understanding of what they're saying and nobody seems to get that killing the opposing viewpoint is not the solution since their viewpoint is what creates the contrast necessary for you to have one in the first place.<p>So, to conclude, I apologize to noonespecial for the flame; my patience with an increasingly intelligence-diluted Web wanes.",1217657505

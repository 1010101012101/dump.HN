Vendors are free to implement whatever they'd like.<p>The only way a vendor should be encumbered by the W3C is that if they choose to implement a feature, they should <i>also</i> support the W3C incarnation of that feature. That's it, full stop.<p>The problem with IE6 isn't that it did extra things. It's that it did a variety of things (some extra, some not) <i>badly</i>, and then Microsoft <i>refused to bring it into compliance</i>. That's not a problem we have with Webkit. So what are you saying when you try to tar Webkit with the IE brush? How familiar are you with the development process behind Webkit?",1328914763

Here is an\nexample in HTML:\n<a href=""http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/litprog.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/litprog.html</a><p>In addition to the benefits mentioned there are at least 3\nothers I can site.<p>First, since you spend time explaining why you are writing\nthe code and your thoughts on the design and implementation\nyou naturally discover edge cases, missing cases, and bugs.\nAs a result, the quality of the code is higher.<p>Second, if you program in a team that does code reviews,\nthe team can see your approach to the solution and the\nreasons. They can critique your work at a more profound\nlevel. If the code review happens before accepting the\nchange commit, the quality of the code is higher.<p>Third, code lives. Sourceforge is a gravesite of hundreds\nof thousands of programs that have died because the authors\nare no longer maintaining the code. New users are confronted\nwith a source tree of tiny files which they are unable to\nunderstand and therefore unable to modify and maintain.<p>I have the ""hawaii test"" criteria. If you can hire a new\ndeveloper, give them your program, send them on a 2 week,\nall expense paid vacation to hawaii, and when they return\nthey can modify and maintain the program as well as the\noriginal authors, then you have a fully literate program.<p>As for the question of debugging, I find that it is no\ndifferent. Generally the source of bugs are the same (e.g.\nusing copy/paste and failing to properly fix the copy).<p>Literate development, for me, takes on two different styles\ndepending on the language.<p>In a language that allows a read-eval-print loop, like lisp,\nit is trivial to work in emacs with a command line in one\nbuffer and the literate sources in another buffer. You just\npoint at the changed code and evaluate it immediately in \nthe other buffer. It is very productive.<p>In a language like Java that is a pure compile environment\nI create a makefile that extracts the code from the \nliterate document into the proper com.foo.baz.... source\ntree, compiles the code, and runs the test regression suite.\nThis generally takes less than a minute or two for most\nreasonably sized Java programs. So I make a small set of\nchanges, save the buffer, run 'make', and see if the tests\npass. For TDD programming I find this works very well.<p>My last large program was 60000 lines of Lisp in a latex\nliterate file. Tex'ing the file with all of the literate\ndocumentation generated 6000 pages. The technology scales\nquite well.<p>Learning literate programming is like learning lisp. You\nkeep wondering why anyone would program this way until you\nsuddenly ""get it"". Once that happens you wonder why anyone\ncould program any other way.<p>Tim Daly",1328914029

A lot of us are implementing the entirety of the UI in client technologies and utilizing the back end via REST as a service layer. In this architecture, the stack you choose becomes less important because if you decide to swap it out you just start writing new services in the next languadge that you choose. For example I was doing quite a bit of REST services in Java but I just switched over to Clojure and have been implementing new services in Clojure. I could have (almost) just as easily switched over to Ruby or Python if I wanted to. Getting the UI out of the back end stack makes the choice of which stack less of a huge decision because it breaks a great deal of the technology lock in that happens when the UI is locked away in back-end languages. It's not for everybody, but it is something to consider when looking at how the future of the web will be built. The trend of architecting web apps in this fashion is growing as it offers some pretty compelling benefits.",1328913500

Descriptivism is a paradigm of linguistics in which language is analyzed as it is used within a given population and point in time, rather than analyzing it according to a strict and timeless set of rules (a.k.a. prescriptivism). Rather than defining a given usage as right or wrong, it seeks to classify the usage according to what populations and registers it's used in.<p>That's not to say descriptivism has nothing to say on what language one ought or ought not use, just that the recommendations will be dependent on who your audience is and what setting. Like: using ""y'all"" in Texas wouldn't raise any eyebrows, but in Wales it certainly would. And using ""hoosflaw"" to mean ""pickles"" wouldn't work anywhere.<p>In the U.S., I'd wager that adverbial 'good' is used quite a bit informal contexts like conversation, texts, or Facebook posts. So it's up the author (native or not) what sort of feeling they want to evoke while delivering their message. Homey and conversational? Authoritative and experienced? Silly and offbeat?<p>That said, if you're not confident in your command of the language you're using, formal is probably best, since A) it's probably mostly what you've been taught, and B) it'll be comprehensible and acceptable to everyone.",1328913099

In 10 or 20 years a long list of technological innovations and cummulative advances will put more than enough processing power on people's desktops, bringing advanced rendering techniques like radiosity and ray tracing into the realm of real-time rendering with commodity resources.<p>But that's not that the hard, or interesting part. The hard parts will be making content and simulating physics convincingly. It is already hugely expensive to have artists painstakingly recreate textures and models for 3d environments, how much more difficult will it be to do so at higher levels of fidelity? Obviously we need some pretty significant tooling breakthroughs to make this problem even remotely tractable. The physics problem is even harder. It's a lot easier to fake it and just cram things into acepted game mechanics (invisible walls, imovable and indestructable objects, etc.) than to perform robust simulations. Physics may easily require more computing power than rendering.<p>But a simple immersive photo-realistic virtual 3d world is but a tiny corner of the implications of such technology. Think about augmented reality, for example, integrating smart phone functionality into the world around you convincingly using transparent displays. Or using VR goggles that reproduce images of the real world with overlayed data. Seemlessly integrating infrared or radar data, for example.<p>Imagine playing a game of cops and robbers except with enhancements that merge it with a video game. Or simply imagine the world being enhanced in a seamless and subtle way with computer data, like a hud but far more sophisticated. Imagine if every single person in the world was not a stranger to you, if you could instantly know their name, their job, their public history, etc. How does that impact society, friendships, business, government, war, etc. The implications are both broad and deep.",1328912071

Since the Blu-rays contained the original audio track, said fans would have lost nothing by ""bootlegging"".",1328911639

I think the Kickstarter model is really powerful, and it's exciting to see that these projects have got off the ground, but - without wanting to be party pooper - what happens if a fundraiser can't deliver?<p>It seems that Kickstarter have an incentive to raise as much money as possible.  After all, they take their 5% - so as a company they've taken over $100,000 in the last 24 hours from two projects alone.  Spending a vast amount of money without the necessary battle-scars and bruises gained from experience, is likely to involve a steep learning curve.<p>Bringing a product to market isn't easy.  The fundraisers in question are in a unique position, because they have their buyers' attention and money from the start.  This has to be a great thing, and to large extent levels the playing field and creates a great environment for innovation .. BUT, the hard work has just begun.<p>I can't help feeling that this model of funding is about to gain even more popularity - but could eventually open up a can of worms.",1328911598

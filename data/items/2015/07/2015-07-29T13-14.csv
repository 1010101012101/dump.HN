IMO it&#x27;s possible to teach Excel users some basic practices from programming (like code review, testing etc). We (I have a company with my friends) actually have created a project that allowed a company write formulas in a simple file which generated a fully functional webapp. They used version control and code review together with unit tests. This allowed analysts build a solution using their knowledge without the need to have programming skills. This is a different approach programming Formulas -> Web application, but I believe an approach programming Formulas -> Excel is also possible.",1438178186

When they come home from work, do they want to deal with a new operating system? No. 15 years ago, when personal computers were the new shiny thing, they would. But today, they have smartphones (which they use more then their PCs, anyway), they have tablets and an existing computer that <i>just works</i>. They won&#x27;t switch over.<p>* Private (power) users: These are the users that would spend an at-home day and be excited enough about a new operating system to try it. But are they passionate enough about <i>Windows</i>? Probably not. There are so many exciting pieces of technology today, Windows does, for most people, not belong to the <i>most</i> exciting pieces of technology anymore. Better buy a Lily camera or a Raspberry Pi. Oh, and let&#x27;s not forget that power users have invested a lot of time into thorough configuration of their operating system. They don&#x27;t want to lose this or need to re-configure everything.<p>* Business users: They want stability and reliability above everything else. Why switch to Windows 10 if your Windows 7 will still receive updates until 2020?<p>* Technology novices in emerging markets: People in emerging markets and developing countries often skip the PC altogether and start with mobile devices. Or they get Chromebooks, Linux, OS X.<p>* Mobile device users: Microsoft has been too late to the game. We all know this and Microsoft even knows themselves. This is why they focus on &quot;reinvent[ing] productivity to empower every person and every organization on the planet to do more and achieve more&quot; (Nadella) on <i>any</i> operating system.<p>Windows had its heyday, but it will never come back to past dominance.",1438177651

There&#x27;s a constant struggle between advertisers, publishers and browser/platform developers for data -- not to mention a huge conflict of interest with Google (and to a lesser extent Apple).<p>The reason ad networks are so bloated is because web advertising as it currently stands has a measurement problem: if I display an ad, I have no way of knowing if a reader even saw it. This is why you rarely see ads displayed below the fold; and when they are, they&#x27;re wrapped in a bunch of JavaScript or Flash to ensure they&#x27;re not tracking displays for ads that were never seen. Advertisers literally want pixel-level tracking of page scroll, mouse movement, etc. and they use all this bulky JavaScript to collect it. Do you think it&#x27;s a good idea to let the browsers report this information? Because if not, the advertisers are going to inject as much JavaScript as they can to use every workaround to collect as much data as possible.<p>This also ignores the fact that Google is the head honcho of online advertising. Google can (and probably does) collect much of this information from inside Chrome. They would be violently opposed to sharing this data with their competition, because proprietary data like this enables them to charge a premium for ads they place. Advertising is all about proprietary data sources, and the moment something becomes commoditized it loses most of its value. Considering Google makes something like 95% of its revenue from its network of proprietary user data, they would never engage in any sort of browser ad placement unless it funneled money through them (which their competitors would never go for).",1438177438

This works well for pop music, where the songs are short and they are listened to many times by the typical user.  It works less well when the &quot;songs&quot; are 45 minutes long and typically only listened to once (famous works are recorded by multiple orchestras and listeners are likely to check out several and perhaps only ever return to their favorite interpretation).<p>This means that for many it&#x27;s still more profitable to sell a small amount of CDs than to be on spotify.<p>I suspect this will change over the years because there&#x27;s now a very large overlap between those that still listen to CDs, don&#x27;t use spotify, and listen to classical music.",1438176680

As to reflect to your &quot;Fact&quot;s:<p>&quot;Fact&quot; 0: In today&#x27;s agility etc: this is mostly true for startups where you have a product owner who does not really know what he wants. If you use for example SCRUM you plan beforehand and you have an immutable sprint when you know what to work on thus you can work uninterrupted for 1-2 weeks then you can have a meeting to discuss the direction and have a retrospective + planning. The &quot;work for 6 months in a basement&quot; is an exaggeration and no one works like that today (except for the developer of Dwarf Fortress but it is another story). So the point is: you can be agile/rapid/do MVPs/etc and uninterrupted at the same time. I have done it at many companies so I know it works.<p>&quot;Fact&quot; 1: Distractions have nothing to do with culture. People in an open office distract you simply because your preferences does not match:<p>* switches off air conditioning<p>* bumps your chair because of small spaces<p>* turns on the lights (which you don&#x27;t like)<p>just to name a few.
Another thing is that policies work in theory but in reality most people will think that their problem is more important than some policy and will go to your desk and ask about something (and in most cases the will know the answer when the have finished speaking). If you have a private office it acts as a barrier for such distractions.",1438176205

A network bridge called bridge0 and an IP of 10.0.0.1/24

They can determinine which posts or adverts you might &#x27;Like&#x27; based on your friends choices, or those of other similar groups of users found by various demographics and metadata. It&#x27;s right there in the research group page you linked:<p>> &quot;We strive to find ways to deliver more engaging content in News Feed, rank search results more accurately, and present the most relevant ads possible.&quot;<p>I think it&#x27;d be a pretty poor use of ML and AI to use it to try and guess the gaps in your profile, and then <i>fill them in</i>. Of course I&#x27;m sure they try and show you content and adverts based on what they believe your demographic profile might be, but these beliefs are purely internal to the algorithms that make the decisions as to what to publish - they aren&#x27;t used to populate your public profile.<p>In fact, Facebook <i>want</i> the profile information to come <i>from you</i> and for it to be as accurate as possible - to help those algorithms. It wouldn&#x27;t be sensible or useful to just set your profile fields based on guesses, no matter how clever the ML behind it. As I said before, I think people ascribe too much intelligence to the way Facebook handles personal information - it isn&#x27;t magic.",1438174872

To name a few that have nothing to do with open offices: Conglomerate building (if your name ain&#x27;t Warren Buffett you almost certainly destroyed value), corporate raiders (destruction of value to line the raider&#x27;s pockets), the 1999 bubble (let&#x27;s throw billions of dollars for &#x27;eyeballs&#x27;), off-shoring, American automakers (do I have to get into the details here), stack ranking, faulty risk assessment (nearly every NYC banking/investment firm). Waterfall (the stupid kind, not the way it was meant to be done, which is quite good for projects involving airplanes and such). Agile (as it is practiced, the manifesto is nice for <i>certain kinds</i> of projects). Windows 8, or MS&#x27; ignoring the internet for a long time. I could type all day.<p>Companies do stupid things all. the. time. They fly in the face of all available evidence. People are put in charge that shouldn&#x27;t be in charge. They are driven by ego, or other measures that lead to sub-optimal decisions. Sometimes they are really good, but just make mistakes. I&#x27;m a programmer, and my compiler tells me I make 100 mistakes a day; I don&#x27;t fault upper management for the same. They just don&#x27;t have that immediate feedback loop that we do. Of course they will make expensive mistakes.<p>Heck we see it in this thread. Evidence shows that productivity is <i>lowered</i> in open office environment, yet we read claims that it is improved.",1438174837

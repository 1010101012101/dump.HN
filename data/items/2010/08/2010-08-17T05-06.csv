Your options are never optimal. I've spent nearly 2 years (on and off) banging and hammering on Drupal to try and make it do something non-trivial. I'm proud of what I've been able to do, but I can't help but think what I could be capable of if I devoted that time to learning to program the right way.<p>With that being said, I would highly recommend Drupal as a reasonable way for a non-technical type to piece something together. The community that supports the project is pretty top notch IMO.",1282024723
1610387,comment,1608669,1609499,0,0,flatulent1,,,"Well if people are going to worry about solar flares, they might as well figure on EMP (electromagnetic pulse) protection from high altitude nukes too.  Energy levels can be very high, and the very short pulse risetime results in energy extending to at least the VHF range.  That means relatively short conductors can function as efficient antennas, picking up considerable energy.  Solar events are lower frequency, so energy from longer conductors such as power lines is the first thing to worry about there.<p>It is silly for those people to be worried about WiFi, but some just don't have a clue as to the differences between ionizing radiation and electromagnetic radiation (and the importance of power levels).  But the same folks will gab with a cell phone against their heads...",1282024706

Common compiler techniques include intermediate tree representations, parsing of symbols, various recursion-based optimization passes on the intermediate representation and phases, and various serialization techniques.""<p>The second sentence is a good definition.  The first sentence is probably the cause of the disagreement -- it's so vague as to possibly describe a C compiler, as well as a Chinese Room, a signal detection algorithm, a kid doing his math homework, etc.  I'm not quite sure what you call something that transmutes a stream of symbols into other symbols that is precise, but i feel ""things that transmute symbols"" covers a very broad class of things that are not compilers as well.  Someone doing their chemistry homework, for instance.<p>I mean, yes, a compiler will transmute symbols, but it's the second sentence is how we distinguish that from, say, a DSP.

Like the author, I had little practical experience in actually succeeding at entrepreneurship.  And yet they'd be voted up <i>really high</i>.  Once in a while, some old salt like, say, the guy who founded Digg or the guy who founded Symbolics would reply and say ""You're naive and ignorant.  You won't think so poorly of jobs once you've run your own company for a while"" (in nicer terms, of course).  But by and large, Startup News loved wild-eyed optimism.<p>Now, the vast majority of comments hold that same sort of ""Well, it's more complicated than that, and I'm quite happy with my 9-5"" view.

Point to one, and then the next which it connects to, lather-rinse-repeat to 40 points (more if it's a directional graph), or draw 20 lines and leave them up for people to peruse simultaneously?  People just can't remember that many things at once, so you'd rely on someone to marker in your lines... to be erased if you come up with something better?  Even changing a single line means several dots + waiting for someone to walk over and do it for you, instead of just changing what's displayed.<p>And how about completing a circuit diagram?

Avoid non-standard CSS hacks entirely. It has a higher chance of breaking and not-working because, as you said, CSS3 is not finalized.<p>I wouldn't care if it was supposed to be some sort of academic tech-demo, but in the comments the author says:
><i>On Posterous they are going to be used in many places</i><p>edit: moral: JavaScript enabled\disabled is 1 axis of degradation. Non-standard CSS3 hacks have 3 axises: Browser type, browser version, state of CSS3 spec. It's a statistically worse bet.",1282021405

Some software development, but I dealt pretty extensively with strategy as well.<p>I had very hard deadlines all the time. My job was 8-5 every day, but I would usually have to leave for an hour or so 3 times a week for class. That didn't really change anything, it just meant that I was  working later than 5pm every night and fitting classes in later.<p>It wasn't that hard. It helps that I don't stress about anything. But I would like to point out that I was not obsessed about my grades like some people tend to be. I carried a decent GPA through school, but nothing impressive. The nothing impressive was partially a function of my own doing and partially my heavy schedule. I was never pressured into getting great grades and never put that on myself. Mostly Bs with some As was fine for me.",1282021265

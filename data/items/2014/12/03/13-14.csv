The coolest thing has been some peoples&#x27; reaction to the little details on my CV (Resume.)<p>Compared to the other very unsuccessful interview, where the MD just listened to me talk for a few minutes and said &quot;you&#x27;re not what we&#x27;re looking for&quot; (no programmer in the interview), getting engineers to ask me end-of-interview questions with a smile on their face was really fun (whether or not I get the jobs in the end.)<p>The OP says that engineers were quite good if the CV contained enough detail about what the candidate had been <i>doing</i>, the substance of the projects. In both cases, the little question was where I had included a bullet thinking &quot;noone in HR will know what this means, but I think it&#x27;s cool&quot; were the ones that got the smile question.<p>For the record, all my CVs are skills-based (that is, a set of bullets around &quot;programming&quot;, &quot;teamwork&quot;, &quot;communication&quot; etc) followed by a brief chronology of work and education, rather than having to list every position (student volunteering included) in order to say what I did there that was relevant. Customising which bullets (and even sections) you include on a per-application basis is extremely important, of course, so that the HR person can see &quot;skill that we asked for: 5 bullets&quot; right there on the first page.",1417615141

8693722,comment,8687962,8690054,0,0,JohnTHaller,,,"It is accurate that you can pay from all cards and countries if you take their meaning to be logoed cards (Mastercard, Visa, Discover, American Express, etc). Nearly all debit cards in the US support one of those standard payment systems, so you can use them everywhere regardless of whether a specific store supports debit cards. It sounds like Lastschrift isn&#x27;t logoed with one of those, so a store can only support Lastschrift if they <i>specifically</i> support Lastschrift by connecting with one of those payment processors. As such, it isn&#x27;t supported by most US or worldwide websites unless those sites have taken specific steps to support it.  Several countries have setups like that where there is a specific proprietary payment system that is only supported within their country and thus not supported in most websites outside of their country.

If we do so, the only incentive for the cabbie is to get your service completed as efficiently as possible.<p>And it&#x27;s weird that it&#x27;s one of the only services where we can estimate the cost in advance fairly accurately in 99% of cases, but there&#x27;s no price transparency. Cabs and medical services, maybe. There&#x27;s no reason cab drivers should need a &quot;billable hours&quot; system of payment (at least not since gps mapping technology was invented).<p>I&#x27;d settle for that much. But my more controversial rider is that costs shouldn&#x27;t vary by the time of the trip.<p>The risk of traffic flows should be borne by the party that will experience all the variations enough to be able to average it out. In consumer goods, if you buy a the one out of ten thousand products that are broken off the shelf, (or explodes in your hand), the merchants accept the loss, because they can even out this loss across all of their sales. In cabs, if there&#x27;s suddenly an accident a mile ahead of you, and you&#x27;re just stopped in a parking lot doubling your cost, that&#x27;s your fault.<p>On an individual level, maybe just underpay if you&#x27;ve been jerked around. If the cabbie complains, tell them to bring the cops so you can both talk about the route and they can decide what&#x27;s fair. If that behavior became widespread, taxis would lose the incentive to cheat in this way. (Though you&#x27;d probably get a few people shot in the street.

Russian government is done anyway (economic situation will finish it in a few years), so why bothering? What is more important, I believe, is GitHub&#x27;s attitude here.<p>You see, GitHub is sending polite-but-firm emails right now, asking users that hosted the file in question to remove it and hinting that they otherwise will remove it themselves. I&#x27;m deeply worried about this, because GitHub faces a tough decision: either it will stand to it&#x27;s ground and stay banned in Russia, or it will comply, possibly changing TOS to be able to remove content if it&#x27;s illegal in some god-forsaken country. Think LGBT-supporting groups and Nigeria, if not Russia.<p>In the first case, they will moderately annoy a most active part of Russian society and loose SOME subscribers — GitHub is for programmers, after all, we can handle VPNs. It will remind people that something is broken about their country, serving a good purpose. In the same time, GitHub will prove itself trustworthy to it&#x27;s true customers — programmers.<p>In the second case, the ban will be lifted, but now they have to comply more and more, as more and more programmers will deliberately post that suicide satire in their repos. GitHub will probably lose less subscribers in the short term, but in the same time they will help the devious &quot;divide and conquer&quot; KGBsque strategy, which is no good. Additionally, GitHub case will become a poster child of Russian Propaganda Machine Winning, which is no good, either.<p>So, it&#x27;s money-vs-face situation, when GitHub is forced to choose between helping one or another party.

It specifies how the language constructs interact with this property [<i>]. The fact that compilers use a type system is independent of your ability to write your custom type system, or to use it in a different context (IDE, toolchain, ..).<p>[</i>] Are you saying that a type system shouldn&#x27;t be concerned by the AST of the language?<p>An external type checker for Haskell: <a href=""http://goto.ucsd.edu/~rjhala/liquid/haskell/blog/blog/2013/01/01/refinement-types-101.lhs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goto.ucsd.edu/~rjhala/liquid/haskell/blog/blog/2013/0...</a>\nAnd the various type checkers for the not statically typed languages (python, ..)<p>Also, I don&#x27;t understand why you distinguish &quot;typing side effects&quot; as something different from the rest?<p>> you need to write a different type system for each property<p>But you do have to define your type system at some point?\nAre you thinking of something like Mezzo, where some userland properties can be defined without going down the type-system-definition road? <a href=""https://protz.github.io/mezzo/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://protz.github.io/mezzo/</a><p>> But the interactions can, and should be more interesting, and take into account the order in which the callees are called etc.<p>That&#x27;s why type systems are defined with respect to the language construct, by rules on the AST (? I&#x27;m confused because of the earlier [*] here).<p>To go back to Agda significance for a custom type system, it&#x27;s not enough to define a type system. You generally want to prove that your definition is valid: If your &quot;checked exceptions&quot; says that a program `P` can&#x27;t fail due to an exception, you want to check that you didn&#x27;t forget anything by verifying the type checker with respect to the actual semantic of the language.<p>You can also embed your custom property into Agda type system (isn&#x27;t that what you want?).",1417614126

When looked at from a distance, these observations become much clearer.<p>> It&#x27;s time to be using all of those high-level languages that are so fun and expressive<p>I think for most of us, programmer efficiency is more important than program efficiency.  IMHO, in these cases, there&#x27;s much to be gained from the scripting languages.  For many programmers though, these seem to push some comfort zones too much.  There are obviously some domains were performance is still king and the high-level languages won&#x27;t cut it.<p>> Highly optimizing compilers aren&#x27;t worth the risk.<p>For some they sure are.  Probably would have been better stated with &quot;not worth the cost&quot; rather than risk.  I don&#x27;t see much risk here, more so cost (in the terms of effort and opportunity cost).  I&#x27;d rather not worry about the details of bit twiddling on things if my current problem is plenty efficient on the small n&#x27;s I&#x27;m dealing with.  Compilation time can be a real cost as well.  I have much faster code-test cycles in scripting environments.<p>> Something is wrong if most programs don&#x27;t run instantaneously.<p>I think many people don&#x27;t comprehend how true this is.  Its truly mind boggling to consider how many instructions a second are run these days.  What could your program possibly be doing with all of them in one second?  Again, for some folks there are very good answers.  For most of us, its loading and initializing layers upon layers of classes.  I routinely see some stack traces dozens of lines deep.  I&#x27;m sure each one is providing some useful abstraction of something, but.. really?<p>We have a Java based application that was written without any external libraries, just straight up Java.  It compiles down to a 120KB jar and provides significant real-time functionality with phone systems.  Meanwhile some of our Java based web apps provide a 50MB war, but probably use every relevant Java library out there to help.<p>> Design applications as small executables that communicate.<p>Yes!  I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of mileage out of this.  Many would to well to read Eric Raymond&#x27;s book: &quot;The Art of Unix Programming&quot;.  The only thing I&#x27;d like a better solution for is a nice mechanism to set-up and configure the deployment of said &quot;small executables that communicate&quot;.  I&#x27;d like programming to be as easy as building chain of commands in a Unix command line.  Yet setting up a production environments with chains of commands seems a bit.. ugly.<p>> Don&#x27;t write temporary files to disk, ever.<p>Once upon a time, those in the know would set-up RAM disks.  These days with SSDs, it seems that&#x27;s effectively what we are doing.  Probably a negligible gain to use RAM over SSD.  Only slight advantage of RAM over SSD I see is that things get cleaned up on a reboot (does anyone still reboot regularly?).<p>> Everything is so complex that you need to isolate yourself from as many libraries and APIs as possible.<p>I think this is behind the recent backlash against frameworks.  Unfortunately, many raw languages still lack some basic utilities that make it just a bit painful to use without any libraries.  Seems many people will be migrating towards unobtrusive libraries that add value in the places needed without requiring a cascading set of components and tight coupling with the application being coded.  This is a good thing.<p>> C still doesn&#x27;t have a module system?<p>I&#x27;ve got nothing here.  In general, I&#x27;ve been migrating towards a more data driven approach rather than native code.  I wish we&#x27;d start loading code modules the same way we would load a piece of data from a file or database.  At the end of the day it&#x27;s all the same.  Obviously you need to be sure of the sources you are loading code from, but you should be protecting your data the same way.<p>UPDATE: Minor editing for clarity.\nUPDATE2: And math.",1417613913

This leads to a situation were the few cases that do get reported and have enough evidence are dismissed in court because the minimum punishment for rape is a life destroying two years in prison.

But it is pretty much just that, luck.<p>I work for a state agency and the people around here still view a 4 year degree as an elite status and it drives me nuts.  On top of that, the PhD holders get no respect, its as if no degree makes you nothing and the higher degrees were a waste.  Its silly given the atmosphere (a lab).  And as far as the agency hiring process goes, all applications are put in online.  If they even hint at wanting a degree as a requirement for hiring (even if the position doesn&#x27;t necessarily <i>require</i> a degree, not talking engineering here) they will ask a prelim about having a degree.  Answer wrong and a human will never even know you applied, even if you told someone you did; EVEN if they told you to apply in the first place.<p>The problem with this &quot;college is required&quot; mentality going away is that it is ingrained in a generation.  Today&#x27;s 20 somethings, and tomorrows as well, will have to deal with this as long as the 40, 50 and 60 somethings are still doing the hiring.  They were raised with black and white views of requirements to do a job it seems, only from personal experience.  And even if they give you the time of day, if the decision comes down to guy with degree and guy without, often times the guy without is going to lose because he doesn&#x27;t appear to be the best investment of time and energy.<p>As for me, I gave in.  As humbly as possible I will say I saw through the bullshit since before I left high school.  I could earn as high as marks as I wanted and knew I could do what I wanted, but the chances were high that without a degree I was going to have to have some luck in finding that one special position.  Once leaving the private sector and finding myself in a gov job, as I said, I gave in.  I am enrolled in school.  I am doing as I figured I would, 4.0 blah blah, but still sort of lack direction.  I have picked a path, am going to follow it and see where it goes really.<p>The reality I have found myself facing is that no matter what degree you have, a lot of times, a 4 year degree means you have a degree and that just makes you better somehow.  It doesn&#x27;t even have to be a relevant degree to the position in which you apply.  Especially when a system such as this one counts each year of a degree as an equivalent to a year of experience. (BA required, or AA with 2 years exp, or HS with 4 years exp).<p>Anyway, I will end my wall of text here.  I only wished to share a perspective of someone who tried without, and is in the process of what he ultimately considers concession to the pressure of societal norms.",1417613364

I have a really tiny DSP background (a 3 week lecture course), but specific questions that would help convince me of your point of view would be:<p>- Sampling at a frequency 2f lets us reproduce the specific component of every frequency <= f (proved by Shannon, Nyquist etc). This can be easily proven mathematically, and were it not the case in practice would have been largely discredited (it&#x27;s a fundamental of many fields).These &#x27;jagged&#x27; waveforms must then have their frequency components <= f perfectly represented - the only components that are ignored are those that are > f (I&#x27;ve idealised here, but I&#x27;m assuming we&#x27;ve filtered correctly). If f is greater than the maximum frequency we can hear, why does it matter at all?<p>- When the entire field of digital signal processing (and anyone who uses it, such as a sound engineer) relies on such math from top to bottom to make the recording process work, why should we ignore it as soon as we start experimenting and simply consider what our ears tell us? Why should you ask the question &#x27;why does my mathematical knowledge of a subject fall short of explaining what many people seem to experience?&#x27; in the first place? It seems to imply that your ears are more accurate than a century of study, which at least seems arrogant.<p>- A number of the points you&#x27;ve made (regarding people hearing different things) were explained in some way in the article.

Also, for some reason, there seems to be a stronger cultural objection to engineers getting paid as well as lawyers, MBAs, or physicians.  I think it&#x27;s partly because when you say &quot;lawyer&quot; or &quot;physician&quot;, people think of a serious, middle aged person with grey hair.  When you say &quot;programmer&quot;, people think of a young socially inept person.  I don&#x27;t agree with the stereotype at all, but I think it&#x27;s part of why people would be so quick to conclude that an unobjectionable salary for a lawyer is &quot;astronomical&quot; for a developer.<p>I&#x27;d also say that comparing software development intern salaries at well paying companies probably represents developer pay in its best light.  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s misleading or inaccurate - it&#x27;s a perfectly valid snapshot.  But software developers draw higher salaries out of the gate, but may fade in the stretch.  Comparing what career developers earn at age 50 with their lawyer or doctor friends would probably give you a different picture that should also be considered.  Ultimately, look at the general data - in San Francisco, the median salary for a software developer is just a little more than it is for a dental hygienist and a little lower than for a registered nurse.  Yet many people feel that this indicates a severe shortage - I agree something doesn&#x27;t add up here, but to me, the evidence suggests no particular shortage of developers.",1417613156

Imagine that person A asks a question on an Internet forum, and person B says that HOP has a section that could help with the question. If B wants to follow up, they now must find a copy of HOP. If the book is out of print, this can be difficult. It may not be in the library; it almost certainly isn&#x27;t in the bookstore. Used copies may be available, but you have to order them and have them shipped, and if you don&#x27;t like it once it arrives, you are stuck with it. </i><p>Small publisher here. I believe other factors have contributed to its longevity. I just did a quick lookup of the book on Amazon (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Higher-Order-Perl-Transforming-Programs/dp/1558607013"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Higher-Order-Perl-Transforming-Program...</a>) and it has a couple of things going for it that help contribute to long-tail sales:<p>* Availability of new copies of the book, which signals the content is probably still relevant/not obsolete and may also indicate it’s a classic/foundation title considering how long it’s been in print.<p>* A relatively high number of professional reviews and reviews from experts in the field<p>* A moderate number of great reader reviews, including many “Verified Purchases” from the past year<p>The current sales rank (579,897) indicates it&#x27;s probably selling 1-3 copies per month on Amazon U.S. The fact that there are so many used copies available, not to mention the free PDF, no doubt reduces sales of the new book, but there are still enough people out there who want a new copy of the print edition for their bookshelves to keep the trickle of new sales.<p>Regarding the convenience issue: These days, it’s possible to buy a new book online and return it or resell it later (as 63 other owners are doing right now on the Amazon U.S. site). It’s a pain to list it and handle the packing, but so is driving to a bookstore to bring back a return.<p>A note about free book downloads: Free titles are indeed very convenient for those who are unable/unwilling to purchase the print edition, but they are less likely to be read. I currently have a title available for on Amazon and it’s been downloaded thousands of times, but through various mechanisms (including reviews, follow-on sales of the 2nd volume, clicks to the website from the ebook edition, etc.) I have determined it’s seldom read -- I&#x27;m guessing less than 5% of the people who have downloaded the Kindle edition have actually read any part of it. I think many free ebooks and PDFs end up on people’s devices and don’t end up being read because of a lack of time and all of the other free content that’s available out there.",1417612234

Read under &quot;Listening tests&quot;, and it&#x27;s clear that there is no benefit to the higher samling rate. I highly encourage you to do your own double blind ABX - if you can select 10 tracks where people can reliabilly tell the 44K from the 192K I will reconsider. But until then, everything we know so far tells us that 44KHz is more than enough.",1417611949

Went abroad as well, but went to work in the area I wanted to (game development) and continued to move around and learned a lot in various industries. 12-13 years since then and I&#x27;m making more than 5x than anyone in my HS class that got a degree (and I&#x27;m talking STEM degrees), and more than double what other friends that got a medical degree are making (which took them around 7-8 years to get).<p>Sure, if you want to perform surgery, you are going to have to get that degree, but that is a very specific degree you are going to get and not just &#x27;CS because I like computers&#x27; or &#x27;English Literature because I don&#x27;t like math&#x27; which seems to be why a lot of folks go to University these days: &quot;you got to have that degree y&#x27;all&quot;",1417611911

We created a marketplace that is open for people to post freely in order to create social collaboration but secure so that people don&#x27;t have to worry about the quality of the content or the legitimacy of the person posting it. Unlike other collaborative marketplaces, we don&#x27;t do background check on users or use algorithms to connect people. Instead, we require payment verification through Braintree Gateway before you can post to provide a simple way to pay for your transactions and to create a secure marketplace where users cannot remain completely anonymous.<p>By allowing users to differentiate themselves through their profile, people can use their best judgment given the known variables for their scenario. Essentially, we wanted to modernize classified listings by making it more social, simple, and secure. Taskfriend earns a 10% fee only when you earn money(so if you make $50 on a task or service, $45 is deposited directly into your bank account and Taskfriend earns $5). We try to offer users a lot of value for this fee and we will be constantly developing the website to add more functions to provide users more value.<p>We are currently in open beta to acquire our first users and to test out the first iteration and improve on it moving forward. Any feedback is greatly appreciated and I&#x27;m looking forward to hearing your thoughts. Feel free to post or email me any questions/feedback as you have my personal guarantee that I will reply to every single one. And most importantly, I hope you like it.<p>Kevin",1417611626

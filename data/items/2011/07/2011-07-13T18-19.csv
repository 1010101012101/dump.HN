2760146,comment,2759648,2760036,10,0,bradleyland,,,"Your electric utility service is capped, but they use a different method because electric utilities are metered. You have a fixed capacity feed to your house. For example, our home has 150 amp service. I cannot exceed that draw or the main feed breaker trips and everything goes dark. I can request installation of a larger feed, but I have to pay the build-out, and there are hard limits based on my local zoning.<p>One thing is certain, in no way do I have ""unlimited"" electricity available at my home.<p>Contrast this to your ISP. Say they deliver a 15/3 mbps (down/up) service to your home. The actual data transfer usage isn't metered (you pay a fixed price), but there is a cap for residential service. The reason for the cap is that Comcast has to make arrangements for transfer of that data to its destination, which will cross over in to other carrier's networks. Many of these agreements are made on trade between carriers, but if there is an imbalance, Comcast has to pay.<p>The only alternative is metered transfer. If you had a commercial grade internet connection, you'd already pay based on two factors (sometimes more):<p><pre><code>    * Available bandwidth
    * Data transfer
    * (Sometimes) Port capability
</code></pre>
For example, if you get metro ethernet service that is capable of 100 mbps, you might pay a 100 mbps port charge. You can order only a fraction of that bandwidth however; say, 20 mbps. Along with that, you'll pay a data transfer allowance; usually purchased in buckets. You can scale this to your need.<p>Businesses make this decision based on a profile of their usage. Do they need to transfer lots of data at a relatively slow (but consistent) rate? Or do they need to transfer large chunks of data periodically, but very quickly? Maybe they need to transfer lots of data really fast?<p>Residential customers don't want to think about this. They want to pay a fee and receive service. Comcast built a product around the profile of typical consumer usage. If you go outside that, you get business service, which means you pay for what you use.<p>This whole notion that unlimited internet for $60/month is some kind of ""right"" is just preposterous.",1310583428

At one of my ISP jobs the customer/production servers had a 1:50 or so ratio (but a lot of time was spent on new products/features, maintenance could easily have been 1:200 and our automation was mediocre) but the internal IT dept was around the 1:3 mark.<p>And he said ""IT is just me and another guy"", not ""systems is just me and another guy"", so I suspect that's the case for him.",1310583263

2760091,comment,2759580,2759914,1,0,inoop,,,"In managed operating systems memory safety is guaranteed by the runtime. Typically a type- and memory safe intermediate language is used (CIL, JVM byte code) which is checked by the OS loader.<p>This means that you don't need an MMU to implement process isolation, and threads and processes are basically the same thing. Some of the performance drawbacks of not being able to do pointer arithmetic (breaks memory safety) and having to do run-time checking (i.e. array bounds, type safety) are offset by the fact that context switches for processes become as cheap as for threads as you don't have to setup your TLB every time.<p>In the OS mentioned in the article, Singularity, pretty much everything lives inside its own process, even dynamically loaded libraries.

In addition, one pays based on what one consumes at rates that are at least partially controlled by another regulatory body. In our area, this is the case because there we have no choice to use a different electricity or natural gas provider. The same could be said about our options for broadband service, except that it lacks the same oversight. As a result, municipalities that have AT&T, Wide Open West, Comcast and a variety of less-fast DSL options have significantly better ""specials"" and even service options. I, for instance, can subscribe to Comcast Business service, whereas my parents a few cities over, where Comcast is the only reasonable choice, can only use their residential option.<p>I agree, it's not a <i>right</i>, but I think the author is correct in stating that Internet access is an essential utility.",1310582641

But with NoScript on, I (a) get to see who's following web standards and who isn't, (b) get pages that load faster, (c) get a more secure browsing experience, and (d) by default am spared the UI/UX idiocy that some sites try to perpetrate (especially in the area of intrusive advertising).<p>Using NoScript and ad-blocking is pretty much like using Instapaper or the new Reader feature of Safari - it is an assertion of the user's rights. It says ""no no no, fuck all your irrelevant stuff: give me CONTENT."" Not advertising, not fluff, not background images, not boilerplate: <i>CONTENT.</i> I like how Nathan Bowers put it: ""If it looks better in Instapaper than in the browser, back to the drawing board.""[1] If you purposefully make it harder for visitors to your web site to get the content they care about, you're a bad programmer and a bad person. Bad JS is one of the most frequent manifestations of making it harder to get to the content - and so in my browser, JS is a privilege, not a right.<p>Speaking of privilege: I am privileged - I'm about 100% able-bodied. If you say 'fuck off' to and ignore users who are not - who are for example not sighted, can't use a mouse, or can't distinguish certain colors - then you're also a bad person, in a different way.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://uxhero.com/blog/i-redesigned-avc-com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uxhero.com/blog/i-redesigned-avc-com/</a>",1310581393

Let's call this Rob's Fermi Hack on Hacking ""Hack"":<p>- We'll start with a semi-reasonable approximation of the number of forums in which people have discussed the word ""hack"": usenet threads, mailing lists, social news sites. I like 100,000 for this number. Do you think that's too high? I'm thinking that we have to count everything that's been around since, oh, 1995 or so -- since hackers didn't really seem to care about the definition of the word before then.<p>- Then we need the mean number of times that this discussion has taken place on those forums. According to my semi-private little search engine for HN, the query `comments with ""hack""` returns 45,000+ results, going back to 2008. Amusingly, the oldest result is about exactly this same debate. So let's use 100 for this value, because why not?<p>- Next we need the mean number of replies generated each time this comes up on one of these forums. Let's say ""3"". I like ""3"", because my comment here is the third in the thread started by your comment, and I expect my comment to so dazzle readers with its brilliance that nobody else will bother responding. So, 3.<p>- Finally, we need some kind of time estimate for time-blown-masturbating-about-""hack""-per-comment-per-forum. I'm skewing the curve a bit here with my comment, but that's because I'm a sucker for meaningless gratification. Anyway, let's say 2 minutes for this, because I haven't used the number ""2"" yet. (I think Fermi is now spinning at relativistic speeds in his grave.)<p>So we get: 100,000 * 100 * 3 * 2, for 60,000,000 minutes, or 1 million hours, which would probably be enough to write and polish an entirely new operating system from the ground up.<p>And that would be a neat hack.<p>(FWIW: I agree with you, especially when the word ""hack"" found its way into all kinds of silly little timesaving tricks -- ""hack your breakfast routine by using paper bowls!"" -- but, at this point, seeing someone mention that they disagree with its usage <i>every single time it's used</i> is even more annoying.

As you start out with the equivalent of ""stop bitching"". What good does that to other than antagonize people?<p>2. The whole ""first world problems"" thing is a huge pet peeve of mine. Firstly, following that logic, the only person allowed to complain about anything is literally the one person with the most miserable existence on earth. Secondly, why would we want to accept any apparent negatives in our community/society/country on the grounds that ""Hey, it could be worse."" How is that a useful stance to take? Why is it wrong to want to improve upon ones current situation?",1310580300

I use the xml resume library and generate several formats from my xml source, not that I am a particularly serious person.  Now, I do use txt if I need to actually attach a resume.  As far as I can tell, the document management systems recruiters use that want .doc format are, uh, not very good at all.<p>But, from looking through resumes from a recruiter, I do stand by my 'mangled crap' comment.  I don't know what they do with the things, but half of them come up formatted horribly.  My guess is that the system recruiters use to strip off contact info  and do keyword searches combines with some subtle version incompatibility in Microsoft products.",1310580156

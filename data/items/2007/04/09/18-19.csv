10916,comment,10916,9770,0,0,fuzzyman,,,"As an open-source developer (with Python) who uses Windows, Microsoft and their actions hardly ever seemed to feature in the things I was interested in or that were important to me.<p>That actually changed when I got a job developing an application with IronPython (an open-source implementation of Python for .NET - funded by Microsoft).<p>Now I actually use .NET, and I have to admit that it isn't bad. Generally a sane API, and C# is nicer than Java.<p>Still, when I develop my own projects I use cPython, and Microsoft is now 'slightly; relevant whereas for the last few years they have seemed completely irrelevant.",1176145032

Also, IQ does not change with age... so a 14 year old with a high IQ would fit right into your ""elite community"" and immediately spoil the party due to their lack of maturity. <p>Why not just form a blacklist of ""stupid IPs"".

Actually a couple of my friends do with google docs - but not too many.<p>For the apps I use everyday, the browser sucks. It's not just latency, although this is a big contributor to why web apps <i>feel</i> sucky and clunky, but the browser just isn't a very good platform for rich applciations.<p>The google integration between their applications is very good, and getting better, but it isn't enough to make me forget that the interface sucks...",1176144857

10897,comment,10895,10895,0,0,kul,,,"another cool bit in interview:<p>What is Sergey's hot button?\nHe cares a lot about the culture. He cares a lot about deal structure. He is the better negotiator of the three of us.\nLarry is the deepest of the thinkers in terms of the strategic technology.\nFor example, today, I said, Larry ""Larry, what are you doing tomorrow?"" And he said, ""I really need to work -- I need to go talk to these three teams."" And he has this face - you work with people long enough you can sort of tell - hes thinking  I don't have good enough touch (with the teams) on an issue. What that really meansis Larry is going to gofindtheengineers and torture them until he is really, really sure (they are all in sync). And he's very good at that. He's very, very good. I mean, he is really extraordinary.\nAnd that talent is a useful leadership skill because?\nWell, here's another example to illustrate what I mean. We're arguing over the structure of our datacenters -- this was yesterday -- I thought the presentation was excellent. They had the datacenters, the components -- absolutely brilliant. And Larry says, ""I just don't think that's a very good strategy,"" and I go, ""What's wrong?"" I'm a computerscientist. Ithinkit'spretty good. And he comes up with this thing that nobody had thought about -- that he and one of the engineers had been cooking up, which involved changing the way the data centers are built that was the next logical evolution.\nThe point is he ignored every possible chain of command. He didn't tell anyone. He went to this particular engineer who's experimenting with this idea in his 20 percent time.So what I've learned here is you don't say no to that.",1176142604

10892,comment,10892,9770,0,0,prwiding,,,"I believe that paulgraham meant that Microsoft is a DEAD-END. \nMy opinion as to what killed them:  suicide by REGISTRY.  While any operating system needs a file system, the usual critical lack is a DATABASE system.  But instead of a (relatively) simple, open relational database, MS chose some key of hierarchical network database they called the Registry.  This made Windows suitably arcane, but rediculously hard to manage and maintain.  Coupled with the security holes, and the advent of a capable unix-like OS, makes Windows obsolete, if still operable.\n",1176141639

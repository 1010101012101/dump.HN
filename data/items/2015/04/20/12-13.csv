9407718,comment,9404976,9406545,0,0,joshbarr,,,"My agency spent a while planning a Node.js API CMS build of our own, as well as evaluating Prismic and Contentful. We needed something we could confidently sell to clients, that was open source, user friendly and easy to extend. It also had to run on our clients&#x27; own stacks and meet their audit criteria. Wagtail suits those requirements well.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that the Wagtail API module is for GETting content at this point – though I hear a more fully featured read/write API is in the works.  Wagtail &quot;is just Django&quot; so it&#x27;s easy enough to plug in the REST framework and build endpoints on that.<p>I implemented Prismic for a startup recently, and the API is also read-only. It&#x27;s got some very powerful semantic content markup and versioning stuff, but I found it quite a chore to get more than single nodes out of it. In the end, our content editors didn&#x27;t like the git-centric &quot;content releases&quot; metaphor, so they moved off to something else.<p>Contentful has the read/write API thing down, good support, very actively developed. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t support tree-based content, preferring flat collections with relations, though trees are something many users are asking for. As we&#x27;re migrating lots of sites (off a PHP CMS) that have well-tested trees, we couldn&#x27;t quite go that far just yet.<p>tl;dr? No solution is perfect, but Wagtail is making us happy devs, and the community is very friendly. Good luck with your CMS hunt!",1429534716

It&#x27;s not just some fairytale that we&#x27;re hoping will come true someday. It could be reality very soon! It&#x27;s got some pretty big names behind it, including one of the Big Three browsers, so I&#x27;d say that it has a pretty good chance of success.<p>And if Let&#x27;s Encrypt fails, surely someone else will try something similar in the near future. Some registrars are already handing out a free certificate with every domain. I got ~10 certificates in the last year alone, half of them for free (StartSSL) and the other half for $5/yr (PositiveSSL). The momentum is there, it&#x27;s irreversible. Even if we don&#x27;t hit $0, we&#x27;re asymptotically headed toward it.<p>Moreover, given the pace at which governments and other large organizations move, I have zero worry that HTTPS-only will be &quot;enforced&quot; before free certificates become widely available. Ditto for browser vendors. Chrome will not risk blocking non-HTTPS websites before the time is ripe, because if it did, people will just delete Chrome and move to another browser.<p>This whole debate is just a bunch of FUD concerning entirely unrealistic scenarios.

The homeless in Palo Alto aren&#x27;t anything like the homeless you&#x27;re thinking of - the point was that there are many, many varieties of homeless people.<p>And I&#x27;ve seen it. I lived in eastern Ukraine (Gorlovka, Kharkov, Donetsk, Makyevka) from 2008 to 2010. I was a Mormon missionary, meaning I literally walked around all day talking with anyone who would talk with me. And yes, you&#x27;re absolutely right, there are an absurd amount of people who live only to drink, especially in eastern Ukrainian mining towns after the economic collapse when all of the mines are closed. They would follow us around and harass us, try to pick a fight (didn&#x27;t work too well when they were drunk) beat up the other bums (бомж), steal their money, and drink. Mostly just drink until they pass out in the park. I gave a couple grievni to a homeless man once who was asking for bread, and watched him literally take my money, walk to the nearest store and buy a bottle of vodka. He didn&#x27;t even care that I watched him do it. It was my last time giving money to beggars. When we&#x27;d serve the homeless food from the church it was pretty much гречка (buckwheat) loaded up with salt, because we knew they were all either drunk or on a hangover.<p>But I also met Pyotr, a man who was seemed to be in his fifties. He was obviously incredibly intelligent, and had times when he seemed perfectly normal, and he despised alcohol (for ruining his family, he said). If he were diagnosed he probably would have been diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder; I&#x27;m no psychiatrist, but he would take bundles of sticks and obsessively clean out the walkways and stairways until they were spotless. If he saw somebody drop a bottle in the park he would literally sprint to pick it up and throw it away. He dressed in rubber boots usually worn by older women, and just went around cleaning stuff all day muttering to himself. All day, every day. I liked talking to Pyotr. He even recognized that he had gone a little bit crazy, and said he did so when he was studying higher math at a local university. He was working at a level of math that was very theoretical, and he just snapped, I guess.<p>When I first met him, I thought he was drunk or high or something. He had a little bit of a twitch and talked so quickly that his sentences slurred together (not like a drunk slur, just a way that was very difficult to understand as someone who had learned Russian as a second language). But as I talked with him, it became clear that there was just something mentally off.<p>So by and large, I&#x27;d say you&#x27;re correct; it&#x27;s pretty hard to be truly homeless in eastern Europe. Most are intolerable drunks. But some aren&#x27;t.<p>The point I was trying to make is that there are many, many types of homeless people. Of course, the vast majority of homeless aren&#x27;t like the voluntarily homeless in Palo Alto who could easily get a job if they cared to. Being homeless in a country that provides a pension and housing for all is especially interesting, but not all of them are drunk assholes either.",1429533803

Your markup elements can have class names that are purely semenatic. Almost every modern grid system offers preprocessor mixins that can be used in this way.<p>There are methodologies like BEM that are great for providing a semantically meaningful layer of classes in your markup.<p>It&#x27;s true that the complexity remains and is shifted. The important part is that it&#x27;s no longer <i>interlaced</i> with the complexity that describes the fine-scale structure of the page.<p>There have been some huge deficiencies in CSS over the years.

I figure this is one of the best groups to poll since there&#x27;s a mix of tech, design, development, and start-up readers who all likely interact with code at some point.<p>Q. What do you think the most important next step will be for code editors?<p>Over the past few years we&#x27;ve started to see lots of cool things (like alternate layouts, realtime syntax highlighting, auto-folding code, collaboration, etc.). But what do you think is next?<p>From my perspective, the biggest change I&#x27;d love to see is the code editor moving beyond plain text. While the code itself must be machine translatable, the meta-level content (comments, links, diagrams, etc.) could be much more informative and useful; even interacting with and highlighting the code/text itself.<p>I&#x27;ve also been working on a notebook webapp called Sketchwrite and think that could be a way to kickstart the conversation about getting plain text and embedded content to play well together.<p>Sketchwrite is pretty basic; it just combines sketches and writing. However, the way it keeps images and text in sync is different than what you typically find in text/image hybrid environments (like text editors which use relative anchors or explicit object boxes, and image editors which use absolute positioning for each element or layer); instead Sketchwrite anchors are implicit to what/where you draw on the page and flow with the text.<p>Clearly Sketkchwrite isn&#x27;t the answer here (without a whole lot of re-work), but I think something like it that&#x27;s tuned for code could be pretty cool. For example, here&#x27;s a quick proof-of-concept of a javascript file with embedded drawings/callouts.<p>https://sketchwrite.com/n/VNpCzRv5r38 (see comment below for clickable link)",1429532407

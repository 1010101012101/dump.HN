7619130,comment,7618406,7618861,9,0,CHY872,,,"The state explosion problem is becoming less of an issue in software nowadays because of the massive improvement in SAT/SMT solvers. The topic of this post is not about model checking, but I believe still interesting.<p>One big improvement when it came to verification came from symbolic execution [1], in which the verifier looks for assertion violations by representing variables as a set of constraints. At each assertion, the constraints are checked to see if they can be negatively satisfied, giving a counterexample for the error. We run the program in a special interpreter (or using some interesting metaprogramming and a compiler frontend etc) and at each conditional statement a new constraint is added, leading to a tree. By cleverly picking branches etc we hopefully drastically reduce the search space.<p>This reduced the state explosion problem in many cases, but obviously there&#x27;s now an explosion on the control flow. A more recent improvement has been to unwind loops a bound number of times, encoding the whole program as a logical statement that is only satisfied by input that will trigger an assertion error. The hypothesis is that the structure of such formulas is well simplified by SAT solvers, and this has been borne out empirically from what I know. We can further improve by natively executing that code which is not constrained, which is a further boon - in principle we could instrument a program to simply return the formula that (if satisfied) produces counterexamples.<p>This sort of approach is very useful in practice because it&#x27;s very understandable to software engineers - in the ideal case where a large company produces a product based on it, one might reasonably expect to be able to pass the software their source code and be presented with a series of counterexamples. It&#x27;s all very interesting.<p>(I&#x27;m not an expert on this, take what I say with a pinch of salt).<p>[1] <a href=""https://klee.github.io/klee/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://klee.github.io/klee/</a>",1398041874

7619112,comment,7618871,7619039,19,0,lambda,,,"What makes you say that this kind of study can never ascend to the level of science? This kind of study <i>is</i> science. It&#x27;s imperfect, but all of science is; science is just a collection of tools to improve our knowledge of the world, coupled with the body of knowledge so gained. Some of those tools are stronger than others, or can provide more certainty.<p>Controlled studies in which you vary only one input to a system at a time, and observe the effect, are obviously a stronger tool than mere observational studies. But that doesn&#x27;t make observational studies not science.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly possible to determine which of these effects are more or less likely to be responsible; the different hypotheses that you make would make easily testable predictions, which can be tested independently because different jurisdictions have made these changes at different times. Lead was banned in different countries at vastly different times (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraethyllead"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraethyllead</a>). Likewise, three-strikes laws have been introduced at different times in different places, and many places have never introduced such laws (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-strikes_law"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-strikes_law</a>). Easy availability of birth control and abortion may be a little harder to quantify precisely, but that can be done too.<p>Since some countries have only banned leaded fuel in the past 10 years, within another 10 or 15 we should be able to say with considerably more certainty whether this has a causal relationship. If the crime data for countries which banned it later follow the same pattern, that&#x27;s a very strong indication that the theory is correct.<p>I would find it hard to believe that the three strikes laws would have the same effect, as the reduction in crime has been happening fairly consistently nation-wide, while three strikes laws have been implemented at vastly different times in different states, or not at all. Lead levels are much more consistent nationwide, as those have mostly been national laws (with the exception of California banning leaded gasoline a few years earlier).<p>Anyhow, I strongly disagree that you can say that this isn&#x27;t science. It&#x27;s imperfect science; anything as complex as the social phenomenon of global crime levels is going to have a lot of complex, interacting factors and no one of them is going to be completely explanatory, and you are never going to be able to do significant studies with controlled inputs. But there are scientific tools for dealing with these somewhat more ambiguous situations, and we can and should apply them as the policy implications are quite substantial.",1398041578

7619100,comment,7618049,7618049,2,0,fjk,,,"> Culture is not a good or bad thing. It’s a shared thing. I sometimes hear people say “they aren’t a culture fit” as if it’s a bad thing, or others feel bad pointing this out as if it’s an indictment on someone’s character. It’s not. I am not a culture fit at probably any other company, which is why I had to help start one!<p>This (which is one of Brian&#x27;s notes in the article) is one of the best ways to think about culture that I&#x27;ve encountered. A company can&#x27;t have &quot;good&quot; culture or &quot;bad&quot; culture. It just has a certain shared way of doing things that may or may not vibe with you.<p>On a related note, Tony Hsieh of Zappos believes what your culture is doesn&#x27;t matter as much as having a strong identity. Just figure out who you, as a company, are and the rest will follow:<p><i>&quot;...one of the really interesting things I found from the research is that it actually doesn’t matter what your values are, what matters is that you have them and that you align the organization around them.

7619098,comment,7618406,7618609,4,0,stormbrew,,,"I find it strange to think that TDD and formal verification are at odds with each other. For it to be backwards to write dynamic tests, you seem to be suggesting that it is actually worse than doing neither. I also don&#x27;t see how it can be documentation, glorified or otherwise, and not tell you anything about the properties of the software.<p>Really there are perhaps three practical levels of knowledge about what a piece of code does:\n- It does something.\n- If I give it X it gives me Y (for some finite set of X).\n- It will never do Z (for some finite set of Z).<p>The first is the state most software is in most of the time. The second is achievable with tests and some kinds of static analysis. The last is probably only achievable with formal analysis and code that fits the constraints of that formal analysis.<p>But both levels are at least an improvement on nothing at all. Having functional and documenting tests does bring meaningful knowledge about some subset of what the code does, even if it isn&#x27;t the be-all and end-all of code analysis.<p>So I don&#x27;t see how you can dismiss it so easily, when to me it&#x27;s just a step on that striving you mention in your final sentence. For the moment it is perhaps true that the good is the enemy of the great on this, but that will become less true as the tools get better.<p>After all, even this article talks about only formally verifying part of the code of a web browser.

You have to think that at some point in the not-too-distant future it would be absolutely crazy to launch a rocket where you knew you were going to lose the first stage.",1398039742

JS couldn&#x27;t easily manipulate the DOM either until JQuery in 2005-2006.<p>The fact that Java, ActiveX etc.. had full control of the system and causes problems ensuring security was an issue, but it is not the reason why JS beat them all.<p>Don&#x27;t discount the power of 1) free and 2) easy to use software that is 3) not controlled by a single corporation.  JS is the only web programming language that is all of these.<p>Yea, maybe Python or Clojure in the browser would be cool.  I would argue Clojure is absolutely more difficult for a novice to learn, and Python provides what additional benefit?  JS was there first.<p>The only reasons why plugins existed is you couldn&#x27;t do these kinds of things in the DOM.  JQ, and the subsequent advances in browser technology, HTML, CSS, JS - made it so you can.  Also, other things being equal - programmers will choose elegance over bloat, less layers of abstraction over more.  Plugin architecture became just an unnecessary layer between the programmer and the browser, after HTML/JS/CSS caught up.<p>JS did not become ubiquitous by accident, or because it was the only choice.  There were many choices (all being pimped by big well-funded companies).  JS won because it was the better than the alternatives.",1398039310
7618994,comment,7618826,7618826,1,0,kijin,,,"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP) is an immensely useful resource with a great deal of authority behind it. I used it all the time in college and grad school to get a quick, general understanding of any new philosophical topic that I came across.<p>Just like Wikipedia, everything is properly cited and you will find all the primary sources in the Bibliography. Unlike Wikipedia, SEP is carefully curated by professionals, but I think it&#x27;s an excellent example of professional curation done right. Despite the fact that most articles are written by people who are known to have strong opinions on the topics they write about, the articles themselves are generally neutral and contain pro and con arguments for various points of view. Because philosophical theories are often highly controversial and there aren&#x27;t many concrete facts that everyone can agree on, Wikipedia&#x27;s model is probably not appropriate here.<p>&quot;Philosophy of Computer Science&quot;, however, is a relatively new addition to SEP, and the low maturity of the field is easily noticeable. Too many topics are squeezed into the same article (instead of being separated into their own articles), and despite the author&#x27;s effort to include diverse sources, it&#x27;s clear that not many people are making direct contributions to this field. But I expect this to get better over time. SEP articles are frequently updated, although not as often as Wikipedia. After a couple of major revisions, the article will probably look much better than it already is.<p>Since computer science is very closely related to various other topics in the logic and epistemology sections of SEP, I would also like to see more cross-references... But it seems that SEP editors are less enthusiastic about linking between articles than Wikipedia editors are. Most links are lumped together in the &quot;Related Entries&quot; section at the end. After all, these people are used to writing textbooks, not online encyclopedias.",1398039295

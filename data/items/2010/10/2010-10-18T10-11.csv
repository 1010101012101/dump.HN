I had changed some details I had on file with them a year earlier, so they said I couldn't cancel the contract I had with them without penalty, because we signed a two year contract and ""it hadn't been two years"" (it had been four years, I just changed the address and other simple details on file but apparently they were saying it was only a one year old account). I called my bank, told them to block all charges from the merchant account company and give them no access, and they did. The merchant account company sent a number of threatening letters and would call me at asinine hours (5AM Los Angeles time) but eventually they went away, and they didn't get their $600 cancel fee or whatever nonsense. This was a few years ago, when online payments was more of a wild wild west type deal, I think it's gotten better since then.<p>Anyways - you can always call your bank and explicitly them to block access. For bonus points, tell them you're recording the call in the beginning (even if you're not), and take down the person's info. Then if there's a problem, you can say, ""I explicitly told teller John Winterman on 18th October at 2:25PM to deny access to Paypal."" This kind of accurate record keeping makes banks take you very seriously. So yeah - call the bank and deny access, or reverse-reverse charges... the bank is generally on your side if they're decent. (And if they're not decent, get another bank! I've found all the RBS owned banks to be good quality - RBS, Citizen's, and Charter One, if any operate near you)",1287398794

There are two potential solutions. The first is having a separate bank account specifically for use with paypal. This gives your ""real"" bank accounts some degree of separation from the at-risk account you've used to become ""verified"" according to paypal (note the unhealthy amount of sarcasm on ""verified""). This is the only working approach if you must be ""verified"" by them.<p>The second method is far better; _ONLY_ give paypal a credit card number. You will not be ""verified"" according to paypal, but you now have control. If palypal does anything stupid, you just file a dispute/charge-back with your credit card company. When you reach the stupid ""spending limit"" for an ""unverified"" account, simply delete your credit card number from your paypal payment methods, then close your paypal account. Now you can create a new paypal account with a new email address and the same credit card. The result is you just by-passed their spending limit that _forces_ ""verification"" when reached.<p>EDIT: Yes, I feel giving paypal your bank account credentials is absolutely foolish. They try everything they can to get access to your bank account(s), but at least there is a way around their stupid games.",1287397081

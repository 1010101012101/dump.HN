All systems I've seen out of high-end post production gear (yes, that includes broadcasting gear) have visual timing problems. Maybe I'm biased because I've worked in professional video and TV for too long, but I'm tired of seeing gradually worse quality becoming the norm (compression artifacts, poor color, bad timing, poor sound sync are more and more common) because apparently quantity trumps quality.<p>So what's the last trend in ""quantity trumps quality""? Adding a 3d dimension of course! I've looked at some 3D streams during the World Cup, just to check, on my 2D set. How does this work? Simple, halved horizontal resolution. Oh, BTW it's 720p, so that means actual resolution is 640x720. 5% more pixels than good ol' PAL, that's basically a step back to low def. Hu.<p>Did I mentioned that the first time the industry tried to impose 3D on an unwilling public was in 1958, with Hitchcock's ""Dial M for Murder""?

And I bet they have dirt cheap fixed costs. <i>The website hasn't fucking changed in a decade, and it's more popular than ever!</i> They're probably the Internet company with the highest profit margins! Craiglist is the fucking showcase example of <i>Metcalfe's law.</i><p>But like bank robbers who foolishly think they wouldn't get caught on the 10th robbery, or a gambler playing <i>martingale</i> double or nothing all night, they fucked up. Craig should have pried open his fat ass wallet and toss millions of pocket change towards lobbying, branding, PR and advertising many, many years ago. Instead, they let their enemies, the media itself, define their brand and PR, and they lost control of the message, the agenda and the way they are presented to the mass public.<p>But Craig is apparently too hung up on his neo-hippy ideals of keeping Craigslist anti-corporate to realize that if he doesn't sink to the same dirty corporate warfare as the enemy, then they'll stab him in the back eventually. All they need is one good shot, and it's just a matter of time. I don't really get how a privately held $100 million/yr corporation is ""anti-corporate."" At that point it's just folly and self-delusion, he should have seen this storm cloud brewing miles away and years ago, and prepared for it to hit. Such as when Ebay tried to steal the company years ago. <i>Too late now—say buh-bye to that $36 million a year in revenues from adult ads!</i> Ouch!<p><i>I'm an unabashed Craiglist hater simply because he completely fucked up and missed the boat and failed us developers by not transforming the most popular and best single Internet site of high signal/noise anonymous contact into the best open mashup API of real-time, localized, semantic data.</i> And this souped up mashup data API didn't have to be all corporatified either—Craig could have kept it hippy! Like Twitter! CL would only need to lift their pinky finger to instantly defeat the hundreds of millions invested in data mashup startups, Google, FB, AT&T, Ebay, etc who are trying to pin the market which CL dominates. Again, I see the opportunity cost—by CL not chasing change, <i>we the users of the Internet have now lost more than we've gained from the potential of CL as force for good, community and the overall power of the Internet.</i> I suppose my idealism is even purer than Craig's. :)\nAt the very least, CL can stop sending C&D orders and DMCA takedowns to small websites scraping their data.<p>I believe a data API like this would have caused Craigslist to become even bigger and more unstoppable. Craig, Jim and whoever pulls the the strings are lazy, unimaginative fucktards who deserve to be dethroned so we, the Internet, can have a new winner in the next round of <i>King-of-the-Hill: Winner Takes All Internet Edition.</i> :)",1283601091

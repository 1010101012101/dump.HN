Warrants required for wiretaps is one good example of where the Supreme Court has said the third party doctrine does not hold. The 6th circuit has actually ruled that email (even if older than six months) <i>is</i> protected by the 4th amendment. That's why many are hoping the supreme court will take up the case, or congress will amend the Stored Communications Act to clear up the inconsistencies.<p>6th Circuit:<p><i>Given the fundamental similarities between email and traditional forms of communication [like postal mail and telephone calls], it would defy common sense to afford emails lesser Fourth Amendment protection.... It follows that email requires strong protection under the Fourth Amendment; otherwise the Fourth Amendment would prove an ineffective guardian of private communication, an essential purpose it has long been recognized to serve.... [T]he police may not storm the post office and intercept a letter, and they are likewise forbidden from using the phone system to make a clandestine recording of a telephone call--unless they get a warrant, that is. It only stands to reason that, if government agents compel an ISP to surrender the contents of a subscriber's emails, those agents have thereby conducted a Fourth Amendment search, which necessitates compliance with the warrant requirement.</i><p><a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/12/breaking-news-eff-victory-appeals-court-holds"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/12/breaking-news-eff-vict...</a><p>> In the practical sense, I strain to see how someone can have a reasonable expectation of privacy in say their e-mail when Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, etc, data-mine those communications in order to show targeted advertisements...<p>We're talking the government here, not companies.

And...well, C is a lot faster than PHP.<p>I fixed the backlog setting and re-ran the test, and pancake doesn't drop requests anymore, but it's not improved at all on speed.<p><a href=""https://gist.github.com/4063785"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/4063785</a><p>I was watching top during each test, as well, to get a sense of what was happening; pancake was pegging the CPU at close to 100% user and reached a load average of ~14, whereas the mod_php test was something like 85% user/15% system and reached a load average of 5. This would seem to indicate to me that Pancake is handling something that Apache/mod_php is able to hand off to the kernel, and since it's stuck in userspace, processes end up waiting around for their turn to do stuff.<p>90 req/sec really isn't bad - especially considering that without APC, my install gets ~35 req/sec - but given that it seems to get most of its boost from avoiding re-evaluation of the source files, and given that APC does the same, I don't think it's really all that fair to compare Pancake to a PHP install not running APC, especially since Pancake requires a specially-compiled version of PHP and has to be run as root, so anyone that can run Pancake can install and use APC. Additionally, APC transparently works across all your source files already - it has no manifests to maintain, so turning it on is literally as easy as ""pecl install apc"" and enabling the extension in your config. That's a difficult combination to beat. If you can do it, I'd love to see the results, but given what I know of the architecture of these various pieces, I'm skeptical that it can be done with pure PHP.<p>Finally, I think that trying to contend with nginx from a marketing standpoint is silly, because web applications are composed of much more than just PHP files; I have to be able to serve images, stylesheets, Javascript, and the like for a full web application, so I have to consider the performance of the webserver as a whole in terms of its ability to fully deliver a page to a client to evaluate it properly; a webserver that runs the script end of things, but then struggles to serve up my assets (and even worse, blocks workers serving assets while I have script requests pending) isn't going to be very useful in a practical scenario. I performed my benchmarks with my development Apache install; I can tell you from my own experience that nginx will trounce it solidly, so the gap to overcome is almost certainly substantially wider than in my benchmarks. Considered as a whole, from first-byte to request-fully-delivered, I don't think you're going to be able to approach nginx, let alone beat it, without moving major parts of the application out of PHP and into a lower-level system.",1352778445

As a human being, someone like Sinofsky is no longer hurt by lost income, but that's a blessing in disguise because his motivations were for a long time not of financial nature, which means he is hurting in other dimensions. Feelings such as hurt pride, poetic justice/revenge (they're worse off without me), rejection, are not uncommon. Given the abrupt departure, a general loss of meaning and occupation is quite likely (from the mornings of a busy executive to the long silence of the mornings to follow).<p>(As an aside, the reciprocal ""good job"" messaging is irrelevant - quitting in style is professional courtesy, costs nothing, and leaves bridges in place and doors open.)<p>In particular at Microsoft (drawing from discussions with friends), one common theme I gathered is ""complex"". Life at Microsoft is complex, rich in context, structured, full of details that employees consider important but find it very difficult to explain to the uninitiated. Even the vocabulary has additions and some words have unusually stronger semantics. I have friends who have been enormously stressed, lost sleep, literally developed clinical cases of depression - on stakes that, when explained to an outsider, appear as immensely petty. This is twice as bizarre in an industry that has a high inflation of jobs, which makes it very easy to leave Microsoft. But that's difficult because the nature of these conflicts and challenges makes the employees who are part of them feel they're losing self worth if they quit.<p>So I could speculate that leaving Microsoft has Sinofsky experience the most complex of emotions. However, it's likely he'll rebound and be off to other conquests soon.",1352777246

After you add up the hours, we'll blow through a lot of our savings just -getting ready- to launch..<p>Is there anything we could do for a better rate? I understand that Lawyers often provide good relationships with VCs and Angels, but for a lot of it, it's grunt work.<p>We've done our own drafts, but we're worried about gotchas- Maybe there are lawyers who are more comfortable just revising stuff that you've already done?<p>",1178930126

Water tanks and solar hot water seem quite prevalent in Melb - what's the cost/experience gap that you're referring to? ...""</i><p>If you want re-cycled water with minimal waste. Solar power hooked into the grid selling back to the power companies. Houses re-fitted with better insulation, access to high efficiency white-goods.  Proper citing of properties with north facing aspects. This all takes money.<p>To get the desired outcome, you have to think decentralised rather than the centralised reliance we have now.

Installations of solar heating and electricity. Power that feeds back to the grid during the day & pulled off during the night. There is no effort like this being undertaken in Melbourne save a few enviro-houses. This kind of redesign cannot happen without the combined work of architects, local planners and local government.

Where's the value in that?<p>Then he used the money to buy companies like Coca-Cola (they sell <i>carbonated sugar water</i>, and in developing nations often steal much needed water from indigenous people to do it) and furniture stores (which purchase furniture from cheap laborers and sell it after a 4x markup).<p>This really makes perfect sense when you consider that ""greed"" is a synonym for ""what people want"", with the only difference being that ""greed"" implies that what they want is frivolous, unnecessary, or destructive.

Nobody&#x27;s really heard of it or used it, so beyond a few &quot;Look at this new thing!&quot; articles, nobody talks about it.<p>- The technology gets some penetration. New users pick it up, probably because it solves some issue or irritation they have. They write about how the technology helps to deal with it, or why it&#x27;s interesting; if it didn&#x27;t/wasn&#x27;t, they&#x27;d probably not bother using it, and would be pretty quiet about the whole thing.<p>- If the technology made it this far, there is an explosion in popularity as more people pick up the tools and use the technology. Typically this results in quite a few people using it in the wrong way, or because it&#x27;s the current &#x27;hot stuff&#x27; (rather than because it will solve a particular problem), or maybe picking it up a little bit too early. Lots of these people will write about how the technology sucks, or how it doesn&#x27;t solve particular problems. That&#x27;s fine; it&#x27;s the public knowledge-gathering phase, and although there will inevitably be a lot of negativity, other people will discover the benefits, and the technology will frequently evolve to address popular concerns.<p>- The fourth step, that you didn&#x27;t mention, is that the technology and discussion around it becomes more &quot;mature&quot; - it&#x27;s widely-used, everyone&#x27;s more-or-less aware of the pros and cons.

7023056,comment,7022900,7022900,18,0,pron,,,"When I first learned of Go I thought it had a very narrow use case. The language is basically simplified Java (or a reinterpretation of Java), and works on the same level of abstraction. It&#x27;s not low-level like C/C++ or Rust, and not high-level &quot;productive&quot; like Clojure. It seemed like Java sans JVM, and as Java developers know, the JVM is the best thing about Java (some would say its only grace). It lacks the JVMs runtime profiling and monitoring tools, as well as the JVMs most powerful features of dynamic class loading and runtime bytecode instrumentation. Its only advantages, as I saw them, were a much reduced startup time and a lower barrier to entry for beginners; its only use case, I thought, was for writing fast command-line apps. Most people who seemed excited by Go were Python and Ruby developers who liked the speed boost and the easy set up.<p>Now I think Go actually has some very good use cases. While I would never dream of developing a large, complex or critical app on any platform other than the JVM, the fact that Go produces self-contained executables makes it very convenient sometimes. Fast command-line programs are actually not too narrow a use case, and Go is not useful just for those. I can see myself using it for other small web or network services as well. I still think Go is a JVM-less Java, or a Java Lite, but apparently Java Lite is a very useful thing to have.",1389184082

I don&#x27;t really understand the specifics, but he took a class period one semester to go over the difficulties of building devices that work correctly in zero-G, because sometimes effects that are ignored on Earth have major impacts in space. Among those things is a requirement to balance the satellite to within very small tolerances using some pretty precise measuring devices. I don&#x27;t remember the exact precision, but it was some fraction of a gram.<p>He gave an example of a program he worked on (an environmental imaging satellite) where the circuit created by the electrical bus was geometrically configured (accidentally) in such a way that a slight magnetic field was generated in part of the spacecraft. This part of the spacecraft would interfere with the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field and produce some impossibly small force on that part of the spacecraft, sending it into a very slow, unintended, roll. The force produced was impossibly small, he used the analogy of a down feather from a baby parakeet resting on your hand. The result would have been that the spacecraft would have used all the mechanical energy in its flywheels trying to stay stable, and then used all of its maneuvering fuel and become useless in just a few days. It was caught during some sort of balance test and they had to reengineer the circuit to produce a magnetic field in the opposite direction to cancel out the effect.<p>He gave another example where an instrument package was delivered at the wrong weight due to a change in some insulator. I can&#x27;t remember if it was too heavy or too light. They had to add small weights to a different part of the spacecraft to maintain balance. IIR he said it took them several weeks to get the weights in the right positions to pass the mass balance tests on various axes.<p>I have no idea how accurate this is, but I thought it was an interesting and not-intuitive insight into how things in space work differently than on Earth.<p>He had other interesting stories about thermal management issues and other similar.",1389183210

Between arranging team practice, scheduling flex matches, putting together pick-up practice matches, etc, I spend a lot of time communicating with a diverse group of folks about last minute planning updates. Though I generally prefer email for most things since it immediately pushes to my phone just the same as a text or IM, it&#x27;s been interesting to discover the wide range of preferences that other people have.<p>Some people are 100% email, period, and will respond to emails from red lights, just a few minutes away from meeting you in person.<p>A surprising number of people in their 30s and 40s do not have Facebook accounts (not out of privacy concerns, but general disinterest), completely ruling out Facebook messages/IMs.<p>Some people do prefer text messages, but I haven&#x27;t found that SMS guarantees any particular immediacy. Some people actually reply to their emails hours quicker than their texts.<p>A few people I&#x27;ve dealt with share a single email account with their spouse and/or only check email once or twice a day (which blows my mind on both counts...). I&#x27;m talking about people young and active enough to play competitive tennis too, not your grandparents. In one of those cases, I can get in touch with the guy in real-time almost every time by using iMessage.<p>A few people insist on Skype, Google Hangouts, WhatApp, or some other proprietary network. Guess what? If I want to get in touch with them ASAP, I suck it up and use their preferred network.<p>Maybe the weirdest one is there are a few people I can most reliably get in touch with via Twitter DMs, even though I have their phone number.<p>Point being, selecting an optimal set of communication protocols almost always fails when that set of rules comes in contact with the real world. If you really want to get in touch with people immediately and consistently, you have to tailor your approach to the person.",1389182970

Take a look at the Internet in Romania wikipedia article[0]. In my view telecom companies have grown to disproportionate sizes, almost everywhere in the world, and this has given them enough power to buy the lawmakers. A lot of legislation has been passed to protect them, state laws, national laws and even international laws. So no, I think that the telecom sector has been intervened enough since its creation, what the consumer needs is to completely deregulate it, and to let the free market work its magic.<p>[0] <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_Romani"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_Romania</a>",1389182956

I summarize the introductory paragraphs from Wikipedia, to give you a flavor.<p><pre><code>  Actor–network theory is an approach to social theory and\n  research, originating in the field of science studies, which treats\n  objects as part of social networks. It can technically be described\n  as a &quot;material-semiotic&quot; method. This means that it maps relations\n  that are simultaneously material (between things) and semiotic \n  (between concepts). It assumes that many relations are both \n  material and semiotic.\n\n  Broadly speaking, ANT is a constructivist approach in that it \n  avoids essentialist explanations of events or innovations (e.g. \n  explaining a successful theory by understanding the combinations \n  and interactions of elements that make it successful, rather than \n  saying it is “true” and the others are “false”). However, it is \n  distinguished from many other STS and sociological network theories \n  for its distinct material-semiotic approach.</code></pre>",1389182668

These were equally probable before we gained the extra information, and the standard interpretation is that they remain equally probable after.<p>In the Monty Hall case you choose a door, and it has probability 1/3 of being right.  It remains 1/3 probable after he chooses a door.  The other two doors together have probability 2/3 of concealing the car.  It remains 2/3 after he has chosen and opened a door.

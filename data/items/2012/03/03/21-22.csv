Few examples of marketing to engineers spark quite the same level of skepticism as this oft-repeated claim.<p>Ignoring, for a moment, the complexity of deploying software across multiple platforms, it's important to remember the multiple form-factor problem. The same software doesn't work from a user's standpoint on multiple platforms if the UI isn't correct for that device. The best example I can give is ""mobile versions"" of sites and apps, clearly targeted at the form factor of a phone, being delivered to a 10"" tablet. It's crappy.<p>Bring in the obvious elephant in the room of the number of times this claim has been made from an engineering standpoint and truly failed to deliver, and I yawn every time HaXe is mentioned.",1330811920

Block these, and maybe print a nice message saying that Tor users are not welcome here... I can still connect on Tor from some exit nodes, as seen by this post here.<p>2) If you don't want to block Tor, consider alternate methods to combat abuse besides blocking IP addresses.

""If people commit, orally or in writing, to an idea or goal, they are more likely to honor that commitment because of establishing that idea or goal as being congruent with their self image. Even if the original incentive or motivation is removed after they have already agreed, they will continue to honor the agreement. For example, in car sales, suddenly raising the price at the last moment works because the buyer has already decided to buy.""[1]<p>Cialdini performed his original research several decades ago, but it has been continued by the Freakonomics/Kahneman/""Nudge"" crew.  To the best of my recollection, all of their experiments showed a strong positive effect when public commitment was added.

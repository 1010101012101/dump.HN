The ""journal"" he published in is not considered reputable. Note that the link to it from the posted article is dead. The correct link is with science replaced with physics.

The idea might be that if you just start iterating through all possible alphanumeric combinations, that it's possible you'd stumble on a successful collision before you'd stumble on the actual password. It seems this would only be likely once the number of possible passwords was greater than the number of possible hash outputs (32^66 for MD5, right)? That would occur if the length restriction on the password was greater than the length of the hash output, or a broader charset was allowed for the password than for the hashing output.<p>I guess if this ever actually became a relevant concern, you'd simply keep adding a few extra chars to the hashing algorithm output to keep it beyond the range of reasonable.",1309117988

There's lots of ways to break it.""<p>-Sure, there have been papers written about ways to break TOR.  I've yet to see someone actually do it.  That doesn't mean the NSA or whoever isn't doing it, but you'd think if someone had compromised the system you'd see some story about it. Somebody who was using TOR would have been tracked down and they would have thought, ""hey, wait a minute...""<p>""Project Vigilant""<p>-Meh. Again, if they compromised TOR, you'd hear about it. They'd have given the IPs of hidden wiki visitors to the feds, and some pedo would have been arrested. If PV don't care about pedos, they would have given the feds <i>some</i> information about <i>somebody</i> that would have led to <i>some</i> sort of action.  The fact that none of this has come to light is pretty strong evidence that PV has not compromised TOR.<p>""Wikileaks uses TOR""<p>-So the fuck what?  They have a pretty clear use case, and the fact that ioerror is a contributor means he's concerned about anonymity (for obvious reasons), not that Wikileaks has hatched a plot to snoop on anonymized traffic and leak details.  Why the hell would they bother?  They've got more than enough stuff to leak handed to them.  What are the chances that someone using TOR would be transmitting data that WL would care about?<p>This is just stream-of-consciousness FUD from Zed, of the type we're used to seeing from him.  He throws out a bunch of what ifs and pretends it's an argument.  Show me the evidence.  Show me some indication that TOR has been breached and I'll be the first one to question whether it should be used.

The Alioth results are not necessarily final - they compare a single JS engine, and we have several fast ones now (SpiderMonkey with type inference can be significantly faster on some benchmarks, for example). Even so, the median speed there is 2X, which is fairly close. Admittably there are some bad cases though, in particular pidigits (badly written benchmark code? bug in v8?).<p>2. It is true that JS on Mono has had far less work done, and that the DLR exists. However, the fact remains that dynamic languages are a late addition to the JVM/.NET model. For example, one very important thing for dynamic language performance is PICs, and to my knowledge there is no good example of fast PIC performance on the JVM or CLR. In fact, we don't even have a good example of a generic virtual machine that can run multiple dynamic languages fast (Parrot exists, but is not that fast) - all the fast dynamic language implementations are language-specific, so it shouldn't surprise us that VMs built for static languages don't do that well either.",1309117401

Will still break upon trying to invoke it without parameter 'b' since param 'option' will just take its place while option will become an empty object.<p>Furthermore he argues against ""option = option || {};"" only to do the same thing in the function header: ""function(a, b, option = {}) { .. }""? What difference does that make?<p>The whole section in my opinion is negated by passing object literals to functions. Stuff like:<p><pre><code>  func({ a: 1, b: ""Smith"", option: { .. });

That makes it easy to read and easier to handle since names are agreed upon by both the caller and the function handling the invocation:<p><pre><code>  var opt = config.option || {};

2698783,story,,,4,2,TomOfTTB,"New York, Gay Marriage and The Bible",,"I have a very religious acquaintance that lives in New York.  Knowing my libertarian political stance and my extensive knowledge of the Bible he asked for my opinion on the recent decision in New York to allow Gay Marriage.  Below is the reply I sent him.  I thought Id share it here because I think a lot of the non-religious people who frequent HN will get into a debate about this at some point in the next few weeks.  Ive found most HN type people tend to argue against religion in these debates which is ineffective.  You arent going to convince a Christian to stop being Christian by telling him you think the Bible is unrealistic.  So I post this here in the hopes of giving you some arguments that would actually hold weight with a religious person.<p>-----<p>The first thing you should know is the Bibles prohibition on Homosexuality is over blown.  There are basically three points people use to justify the idea that God is anti-Gay.  They are<p>1.  Sodom and Gomorrah  This story has been co-opted as anti-gay but its really about heathenism.  The heathens come to Lots door demanding to have sex with the male angels.  To prevent this Lot offers them his virgin daughters. This, to me, indicates the mob wasnt gay they were simply people who would screw anything that moved.  Lot is obviously willing to be physically assaulted to protect the angels since the mob attacks him and he fights back (and is eventually saved by the angels).  So if they were just Gay wouldnt he have offered himself?<p>People see this story as anti-gay because the mob turns down Lots daughters in favor of the male angels but this could just as easily be related to them being new (as the new girl is school gets all the boys attention even if she is only as attractive as the other girls).  Or, as I personally believe, its just a function of the story in that the evil mob is obsessed with assaulting the righteous angels.  Biblical stories, true or not, are fables designed to convey a message and the message of Sodom and Gomorrah is clearly good vs. evil.<p>But again the lesson is against heathenism not homosexuality.<p>2.  Gods prohibition of homosexuality in Leviticus 17 & 20  The important point here is context.  This prohibition is made while God is giving Moses rules that the Jews who left Egypt must live by.  These rules included everything from not eating meat from dead animals to not having sex with your daughter. But the one thing all the rules have in common is they are designed to promote the continued existence of a small group of Jews (Gods chosen people).  Eating meat from a dead Animal promotes disease, having sex with your daughter causes genetic defects and being gay in 4000 b.c. prevents reproduction.  So these rules were given specifically to the Jews in that time frame to ensure their continued existence as a group and werent necessarily meant for all time.  This is why, to give an everyday example, most Jews and Christians dont observe kosher laws in modern times.<p>Now some will dispute the above statement because Gods punishment for being gay was death in Leviticus 20.  But this again ignores the context.  That area of scripture also prescribes death for cursing your mother and father, adultery, sleeping with your daughter-in-law and so on.  If you read the whole passage it becomes clear God prescribed death for any action that would be caused by a hard to control urge.  This is understandable when you consider the group he was talking to which were essentially roaming nomads who had lived as slaves for their entire lives (and as such couldnt have been the most sophisticated).  Prescribing death seems harsh in our modern times but may have been the only way to get the rather savage Jews of that time to practice impulse control.<p>3.  Various New Testament Passages against homosexuality  The important point here is Jesus never spoke about homosexuality.  The entirety of the New Testaments preaching against homosexuality comes from St. Paul.  But two points are important there.  First, St. Paul never met Jesus, never had a conversation with Jesus and knows no more about Jesus than you do from reading the New Testament.  Second, Pauls opinion is not in itself divine.  As Paul was a Jew before accepting Christ any prohibition Paul spoke about was derived from the previous two points of the Old Testament meaning if he was in error about their meaning his preaching against homosexuality is in error as well.<p>So I dont think you have much to worry about as far as Gods disapproval of the State of New York. That said let me throw you one more curve ball.  While I dont think God has a problem with the law in New York I do think he has a problem with the gay folks celebrating it.  In fact, I think hed be appalled.   Let me explain<p>In The book of Samuel the people of Israel come to the prophet Samuel and demand a King be appointed over them.  At such a request Samuel feels rejected and prays to God.  God replied by saying this<p>Heed the voice of the people in all that they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me<p>God considered the people wanting a King as a rejection of him.  Because God is all about individual freedom.  God prescribes very few actual laws to modern people (essentially the 10 Commandments and the Golden Rule).  Gods model given in the bible is that people act morally and govern their own behavior and all will be well.<p>Read the message God told Samuel to deliver to the people wanting a King<p>This will be the behavior of the king who will reign over you: He will take your sons and appoint them for his own chariots and to be his horsemen, and some will run before his chariots. He will appoint captains over his thousands and captains over his fifties, will set some to plow his ground and reap his harvest, and some to make his weapons of war and equipment for his chariots. He will take your daughters to be perfumers, cooks, and bakers. And he will take the best of your fields, your vineyards, and your olive groves, and give them to his servants. He will take a tenth of your grain and your vintage, and give it to his officers and servants. And he will take your male servants, your female servants, your finest young men, and your donkeys, and put them to his work. He will take a tenth of your sheep. And you will be his servants. And you will cry out in that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, and the LORD will not hear you in that day<p>In other words God, is a Libertarian.<p>So while I dont think God would have a problem with Gay Marriage in New York I do think God would have a problem with gay people celebrating the fact that their government masters have allowed them to get married.  That somehow their love was incomplete until the government decided to approve of it.<p>Its something to think about.",1309115410

That just provides a little bit of security through obscurity, it doesn't actually harden the passwords anymore.  Thus, modern password hashing libraries just put the algorithm and salt information in the password string itself, so that the string of data you store in the database contains 3 pieces of data: The algorithm used to hash the password, the salt, and the password hash.  The benefit of this is convenience: Different platforms/languages can all create/authenticate various password hash types with ease as long as everybody sticks to this format.<p>And because of this, if you choose a weak crypto method to hash your passwords (which is what MtGox did), then an attacker conveniently has the 3 things they need to attempt to crack the password: The algorithm, the salt and the hashed value all in the same place.<p>However, if a strong crypto is used (IE a computationally intensive and slow hash), then the fact that the algorithm, salt and hashed value are in the same place doesn't really weaken the passwords.  With an expensive enough hash, even if the attacker has all the information about how to crack the password right in front of them, actually performing the necessary computation would be so expensive that a brute force attack is effectively protected against.<p>You can see more details about the format of the password strings and where the 3 parts of data are stored here: <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.crypt.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://php.net/manual/en/function.crypt.php</a>

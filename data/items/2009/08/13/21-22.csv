And the national catastrophic plan would need to start with much broader coverage and higher premiums than the ultimate goal, in order to fund the care needed today by our aging population.<p>It's <i>very</i> difficult to take away benefits that people already have, which is eminently a matter of politics.<p>Also, note the ""POLICY"" at the top of the page.

891002,comment,890597,890668,0,0,mrshoe,,,"This is precisely why the desktop OS market represents a huge opportunity right now. If not an opportunity for startups then for significant innovation by the existing players. Our usage has changed so much that the standard patterns implemented by all popular desktop OSes don't even come close to meeting users' needs any more.<p>I blogged about this recently (<a href=""http://shoptalkapp.com/blog/2009/10/15/the-real-web-os"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shoptalkapp.com/blog/2009/10/15/the-real-web-os</a>), but I really hope that OS vendors are coming to the same realization. Creating an OS that is only useful for firing up a browser, which basically cripples the applications that run inside it, is pretty obviously a broken model. Yet that seems to be exactly what Google is working on with Chrome OS (admittedly, no one knows for sure what Chrome OS will look like at this point).<p>If I had the resources to make an OS that actually <i>embraced</i> the web, I would totally do it... hmm YC application time?",1255985961

890969,comment,890597,890878,0,0,raganwald,,,"I think it matters because the OP's thesis is that XP is ""good enough"" and that Vista's competition is XP, not OS X. If Microsoft allows its HW sluts^H^H^H^H partners to offer a choice between XP and Vista with new machines, Vista sales reflect people choosing Vista. But if Microsoft doesn't allow their partners to sell new machines with XP, the sales numbers appear high but those number don't reflect anything except a large number of people that would have bought XP any ways.<p>In fact, the numbers are crazy-bad with new machines, because some vendors insisted on the right to sell XP, and Microsoft gave them the right to downgrade Vista machines to XP. So even if a large corporate customer buys 1,000 systems with XP on them, Microsoft records it as 1,000 Vista sales!<p>I'm interested in sales reflecting choice, but it is not clear to me how Microsoft's accounting practices help us understand that at all.",1255985361

This may be my language skills though, tone of voice is a subtle thing.<p>Quotes that are confusing to me:<p>> which (until the next release) is a bit slow on the JVM.<p>Is that meant as an apology for bad performance on one benchmark ? If so why apologize, in a benchmark all that matters is the facts, it's slow, or it's not.<p>You leave out the timings on this benchmark, concentrate just on the line count, which suggests in combination with the above that clojure performed less well than python but you left out that data. Or maybe it wasn't, but it would have been consistent to show run-times for all examples, code size for all examples (and coded up in roughly the same way), preferably gzipp'd to get rid of formatting bias.<p>> Might be a little confusing, but it's a great performance booster. << means bit-shift-left and<p>Who is your audience here ? Any programmer worth their salt recognizes a shift operation when they see one.<p>In your clojure examples you consistently count only the lines with code, in the python examples you count the blank lines as well.<p>Besides, who cares about line count when one language puts a whole pile of expressions on one line and the other does not, clearly, line count is not going to be a good metric to compare the one to the other.<p>You're also counting lines which define constants used only once and lines that print headers, the clojure program doesn't have those luxuries.<p>So, let's rewrite the python code like you wrote the clojure code:<p><pre><code>  from math import sqrt\n\n  def is_prime ( p ):\n    if p == 2: return True\n    if p <= 1 or p % 2 == 0: return False\n    for i in range(3, int(sqrt(p))+1, 2 ):\n    if p % i == 0: return False\n    return True\n\n  def is_mersenne_prime ( p ):\n    if p == 2: return True\n    m_p = ( 1 << p ) - 1\n    s = 4\n    for i in range(3, p+1):\n      s = (s ** 2 - 2) % m_p\n    return s == 0\n\n  for p in range(2, 33219):\n    if is_prime(p) and is_mersenne_prime(p): print(""M%d""%p);\n</code></pre>\nNow, please note that I'm not a python programmer of any standing and that I've mangled the code to make it shorter but keep it functional, to compare apples with apples.<p>If linecount was that important than I could shorten it by quite a bit further, but I don't think it is a very useful metric, especially not if you count whitespace lines in one and not in the other.<p>Btw, this one is now 16 lines. Not as small as the clojure example, but less than half of what it was before, I'm sure a real python guru could shorten that by another couple of lines, essentially there is no real significant difference between python and clojure here.<p>The solution where you claim an impressive speed boost is mostly due to the simply running a bunch of tasks in parallel, which when opening stuff through the network is of course a big boon.<p>If the files would have been resident the test would have been more meaningful, otherwise you would have to compare apples with apples by running multiple crawlers feeding a single reducer.<p>And that would have been a sample worth making, but you couldn't be bothered. Then the clojure program would probably have been much shorter than the python one.<p>By the way, running that counting example on my computer here I get a time of 5:47, which is about twice as fast as your clojure run, wonder why that would be. It is also <i>24</i>!! times as fast as the time that you report for python.<p>I'm not quite accusing you of cooking the books but it would be nice to have you find out what went so terribly wrong when you ran that test.<p>And so on.

Process creation is cheap in Erlang, but it's not that cheap.  Naively parallelizing each recursive call loses big time.  (And, yes, I've benchmarked this.)<p>You can get some gain by parallelizing the first couple recursive calls (up to the number of cores you have available) and then running the rest serially, but that uglifies the code quite a bit.  And you're still not going to be as fast as the in-place C version.",1255982484

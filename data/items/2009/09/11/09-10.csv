Would you accept a 31 person study over a two week period for a new pill in which ""most"" of the people given the pill (16 out of the 31) were now immune to any form of cancer? Or would you require more people in the study and/or longer, more rigorous testing before you took the pill yourself or gave the pill to your family?<p>Get over yourselves. 31 effing people.",1252662987

I don't think it matters a shit, damn or piss if someone says ""fuck"" or how many times they say it.

Nothing wrong with 'em. Depends on what you want to do, where the market is, and how your business model is going to work.<p>
People are infatuated with the web: it's easy, it's universal, it's cheap. But everything has good things and bad things, and I could see the case for certain types of software being on the desktop. The way to make money is to make the user happy, not follow the herd. :)",1193500635

73182,comment,73044,73044,0,0,wayt,,,"I am a former patent lawyer (EE), and more recently an entrepreneur who has founded and sold s/w businesses for large sums. If I were you I would forget about patenting your idea and focus on building something people want. Getting a s/w patent will take you about 4 years and probably cost you $20K-$60k to prepare, file, and argue to issuance. I'd forget about it, and focus on solving big problems that real people have.

Cooperating with us to develop one of those other possible product ideas is going to seem a lot more attractive than competing directly with us.<p>Please don't worry at all about challenging our ideas about this stuff.  We are trying to understand the same things you are and our open source business strategy is largely theoretical at this point.",1193498162

(I know you don't HAVE to, but is it a good idea?) >> They should supply you with links to patents they have written (or at least applications). Try to figure out if they are any good. It's a crap shoot..<p>Do you need one in the first place? I read all the books, then wrote the patent myself including claims. I thought the claims looked fine but when I took it to a lawyer he had to rewrite them. We had a lot of back and forth and now they look dramatically different. The point is if you decide to do it, do it right. <p>- What am I not aware of that I'll later wish I had known about? >> You don't know the future, so you may never use the patent...

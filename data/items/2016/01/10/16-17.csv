10875976,comment,10873257,10875838,0,0,RyanZAG,,,"UX design of customer facing systems would actually benefit most from remote work. The UX designer should create a company wide blog (or similar) showing off the current iteration of the design, along with reasons why each design element is included.<p>This is far better than simply talking to many people 1 to 1. It creates a written history indicating why each design element was chosen. It allows stakeholders to understand the requirements behind a particularly strange UX choice and allows them to give suggestions for better UX in a way that takes those requirements into account. Iteration can be faster as comments can be taken from all sides at the same time instead of having to seek people out and set up meetings.<p>I only see positives for a UX designer given the nature of their work is highly visual, functional and is cross-organizational. In fact, I think any company NOT doing UX design this way is probably being inefficient?",1452445138

In a more nuanced system there&#x27;s less incentive (other than wrecking) to inaccurately mark comments as being &quot;informative&quot; or &quot;technical&quot; or &quot;political&quot;, because instead of changing global comment visibility you&#x27;re only changing it for the subset of users who are using that attribute to guide their reading. There are honest differences of opinion as to whether a comment fits in certain categories, but these are more specific and less contentious than &quot;good/bad&quot; and so I&#x27;d expect a much better SNR on them.<p>Collapsing threads is nice but the importance of defaults to the user experience is hard to overstate.

I mean, the most obvious point for comparison in revenue growth figures at the same point in their history would be Twitter, and I don&#x27;t think there are many people who backed its IPO that feel it&#x27;s lived up to its promise after turning the money tap on. Just because Pinterest&#x27;s revenues will grow sharply over the next three years doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t overvalued and under-monetised for its age.<p>Amazon told investors they&#x27;d have to wait because the internet was in its infancy, and profits would taken even longer because they were reinvested in building logistics operations but they were doing a billion in revenue by their sixth year, even as the rest of the dotcom world crashed around them because not enough people were online yet. Facebook&#x27;s management were decidedly unfocused on revenue, in an era where the idea of socially targeted advertising was a relative novelty, but it was also fast approaching a billion in revenue by its sixth year.<p>Pinterest&#x27;s entry into a much more mature market should in theory mean fewer problems to solve, it&#x27;s probably maxed out the &quot;US women&quot; niche that&#x27;s the core of its value proposition to advertisers, and those advertisers are not impressed with its attempts to &quot;build positive experience&quot; for them.

A more important statistic is <i>commuter-adjusted population</i> [1], i.e. number of people in an area during normal business hours, including workers.  That&#x27;s where Manhattan and San Francisco really diverge.<p>The commuter-adjusted population of Manhattan is 3.1 M [2], compared to 1.6 M residents [3].  San Francisco has a commuter-adjusted population of 1.0 M [4, 5], compared to 0.8 M residents [5].  In other words, Manhattan&#x27;s population booms almost 200% during normal business hours, while San Francisco&#x27;s increases a modest 25%.  Manhattan may have 2x more residents, but it has 3x more daytime population than San Francisco.<p>Given it has about half the land area, Manhattan&#x27;s daytime population density is thus 6x that of San Francisco.<p>Attitudes on development -- namely transportation infrastructure and building construction -- certainly contribute to that difference.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.census.gov/hhes/commuting/data/daytimepop.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.census.gov/hhes/commuting/data/daytimepop.html</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.citylab.com/commute/2013/05/most-important-population-statistic-hardly-ever-gets-talked-about/5747/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.citylab.com/commute/2013/05/most-important-popula...</a><p>3. <a href=""http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/36/36061.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/36/36061.html</a><p>4. <a href=""http://ww2.kqed.org/lowdown/2014/01/10/how-city-populations-change/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ww2.kqed.org/lowdown/2014/01/10/how-city-populations-...</a><p>5. <a href=""http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/p...</a>",1452444579

She&#x27;s a gorgeous girl, I&#x27;m not going to hold it against her for exploring her options. If she does decide that a rich, handsome guy is right for her, that&#x27;s fine by me. I have plenty of options too, and that works both ways.<p>> By the way, $200 for a bottle of real Champagne in a restaurant while pricey is not anything to crazy.<p>You&#x27;re just thinking about the Champagne. He flew down there, took her on a trip to a nearby town, dinners, drinks, and dancing every night. Sure, $300 isn&#x27;t that much when it&#x27;s just for the one dinner, but my guess is that he blew well over $5k on this one trip.<p>That&#x27;s a lot of money. Worse, it&#x27;s a lot of time. Were I him, I&#x27;d just have hired an escort got on with it. She enjoyed the parts she enjoyed and didn&#x27;t enjoy the parts she didn&#x27;t enjoy. To me it&#x27;s an extravagance that is wholly unnecessary. I would not trade my life for one of that kind of luxury. If I could add the ability to pay for that kind of luxury onto my current life, sure, that would be fine. But the best things in life really are free.<p>> And yeah, some of the best places in town to eat are expensive.<p>Depends on where you live. If you&#x27;re in NYC or LA, where all the talent flocks to, certainly the top restaurants there are great. Generally in a mid-size city like Kansas City or Atlanta, the ethnic restaurants available are amazing the best of those simply blow all but the very top-tier ones away. At my company, we go to Houston&#x27;s sometime on the CEO&#x27;s dime. The $30 plates there are decent, but I always come away wishing I&#x27;d been able to go to my favorite Korean taco place.<p>> So if you were her, would you rather the option to eat at any of the best places or only the ones you could afford?<p>I think she&#x27;s coming around to my way of looking at things. I took her to a Korean yesterday (different from the taco joint) and this girl, who has been wined and dined by crazy-rich guys, was over the hill about how amazing the food was in this little hole-in-the-wall strip mall joint and how it was some of the best food she&#x27;s ever had in her life.<p>I go there twice a month.<p>Certainly she&#x27;d like to have the best of both worlds, but Hugh Grant isn&#x27;t knocking on her door. I don&#x27;t have to compete with movie stars, I can just compete with the other guy she dates. And from what I hear from her, you can be rich and handsome and still be an insufferable bore.<p>If anyone&#x27;s using anyone, it&#x27;s her using these guys for spa treatments and dinners.",1452444315

I am a security guy on the outside of the startup world looking in and I was just trying to get a better feel for what the security landscape looks like.<p><i>You&#x27;ll find that startups between seed funding and Series A are most likely to care about security. They have the funding to pay external firms for audits but they won&#x27;t want to invest in a full-time security team just yet. After that, if they eventually get to &quot;enterprise&quot; level they&#x27;ll care more about security and have both an in-house team and external reviews.</i><p>I figured this was the case. Pre-seed startups are too concerned with getting something to market and most who raise (and have something worth owning equity in) would have the funds to outsource to you.<p><i>As for your proposal of equity, I would never do this. Frankly, security services are closer to insurance than they are to building positive value. I have interacted with many startup founders, and most would not take an equity proposal like that for this reason. There are several obstacles.</i><p>The equity for security question was mostly hypothetical to get a better understanding for how security is valued among early employees.

Some people like to have everyone&#x27;s attention now and again, to demonstrate something about their status.<p>- They haven&#x27;t figured out how to do it yet, both technically and socially. If you have one or two people who don&#x27;t know how GitHub works, or how Trello or Slack work, you can&#x27;t do it. There are certain people who come from an age where you never needed productivity tools, and they just can&#x27;t use them, no matter how easy it is. Unfortunately, they tend to be the people who can decide whether remote is working out for the team.<p>- They haven&#x27;t figured it out socially: some people have configured their home life in a way that doesn&#x27;t work for remote. The associations between being in the home and being away from home are deeply ingrained in some folks.<p>As for actual productivity, I&#x27;ve found it skyrockets in a properly functioning remote team. We have a Slack/Trello/Github/etc mashup where Slack is the hub. Anything that comes up can be pinged to the right person, and you can see when people are pushing code. The cards let you organise things. No commute + set your own hours means you get things done.<p>Not being tied to a location is great, too, though I do try to make sure the family gets enough attention.",1452443711

For one thing, it establishes a mindset of &quot;internet points&quot; which encourages grubbing for upvotes, especially on HN where you must either grind out 500 points worth of relatively meaningless comments, or wait until you have the time to post 500 points worth of useful messages, which takes much longer, before you can use downvotes. If your opinions don&#x27;t match the overarching consensus of the community, it may take forever because people downvote those with which they strongly disagree.<p>The goal of user feedback on submissions and comments should be to gain information about the comments in a more nuanced system than the linear &quot;good/bad&quot; scale, so that the site can make use of this information to help users achieve their browsing goals. The other problem with up/down votes is that they&#x27;re used to decide ordering, i.e. visibility, and everyone wants their comments to be read (that was the motivation for posting them). Thus there&#x27;s a natural incentive to try to grab the screenspace with the most eyeballs. People are incentivized, then, to post at the top of threads or reply to the most upvoted comment, to upvote parent comments of their own, and to downvote other &quot;siblings&quot; in the tree. These are noise votes that provide no insight into any inherent property of the content, but simply fall out of the misaligned incentives. I&#x27;d like to see a system which lets HN answer the following questions: Is a comment well-written but trollbait? Is a comment a simple request for explanation, or a brilliant informative summary of a topic? Is a comment accidentally on the wrong post, or is it someone mistaken about matters of fact? Is a comment political or technical? Is it a first-person account from someone involved in the article? Is it anecdata? Is it an empty &quot;me too&quot;? There are many roles comments can be playing and if you&#x27;re reading HN with a particular goal in mind, sorting user content into these buckets would be very useful.<p>Slashdot had a better system than HN has, decades ago. The reason HN&#x27;s is so poor is because the incentives are misaligned and pg does not actually care about the quality of discourse here, but merely the quantity and subject of discussion (because HN exists to farm cultural capital for venture capitalists).

That distinction relies on values, and every person may come up with a different labeling of something as charity or not. I studied history and my views are largely shaped by that. I believe that the current distribution of power and resources in society is largely a result of what you may call &quot;charity&quot; to the people who are now rich (and that&#x27;s putting it very kindly).<p>> Which is what we need to know unless we&#x27;re specifically trying to change something.<p>As what we do or don&#x27;t do determine the outcome, any decision is a political choice. Saying that we&#x27;re specifically trying to change something is no different from saying that we&#x27;re specifically trying to keep something the same. Today&#x27;s bet is tomorrows outcome, and you must place a bet.<p>> Just looking at e.g. the racial composition of the output doesn&#x27;t actually tell you if anything is wrong.<p>We liberals have an assumption. It is no more arbitrary than conservative assumptions. The assumption is that -- unless proven otherwise -- no group of people wishes to yield power over themselves to others, and that different groups have similar capacity for &quot;power-gaining&quot; achievement. Therefore, if we look at the racial or sexual makeup of a certain source of social power and we find a gross disparity, we want to balance it.<p>> It could be (and often will be) that the algorithm is measuring other things that are correlated with race.<p>Absolutely. The problem is not what the algorithm tells you, but what you do with the information. Because what determines the future outcome is not the output of the algorithm, but your decision on how to act.",1452443139

10875786,comment,10874652,10874652,0,0,dsacco,,,"I run a successful security firm, so I feel fairly qualified in saying this: your equity proposal is not financially sound. It&#x27;s a creative idea that has been considered before, but it&#x27;s not something I would consider, and it&#x27;s not something most (any?) of my clients would consider. Frankly, software security services are closer to insurance than they are to contracted software development. You have a variety of obstacles to making this successful.<p>First, investors would be concerned that the founders are offering equity for &quot;non-employees&quot; and &quot;non-core&quot; consulting services. Investors don&#x27;t like to see independent contractors getting equity to begin with - the only case they&#x27;d be okay with this is if the founders need help building the company&#x27;s fundamental software.<p>Second, your shares would be the first to be diluted when it comes time to see whose shares are not as important. 0.1% equity for a year&#x27;s retainer? That usually amounts to 12 weeks of actual work, maybe less. This is an amount they will eventually offer to full-time employees over a period of several years. How would you vest it?<p>Third, consider that if your firm is providing security audits for equity, you are self-selecting for startups which have poor business acumen (in that they accepted this deal). Your already poor chances for any equity return at all just became poorer. How long can you provide security services on a &quot;I&#x27;ll take a hamburger today and gladly pay you tomorrow&quot; basis before you run out of money and need to actually charge market rates? It&#x27;s not sustainable.<p>Finally, you are basically a de-facto investor, in that you need to select startups you believe will be winners, otherwise your equity will be worthless. You&#x27;ll have to be both an excellent angel investor with your startup bets and an excellent security provider, and this will be further complicated by the fact that only inexperience or bad founders will be likely to offer equity in return for security.<p>In other words, it&#x27;s a bad deal, most people won&#x27;t take it and you&#x27;ll probably be burned by those that do. It&#x27;s not sustainable and if you&#x27;re doing this because you want to get rich, consider that running a successful security firm and doing good work for fair market rates will get you there.<p>To answer your (easier) second question - most startups care a lot about security once users start asking them difficult questions. Then they turn to firms like Sakurity, NCC Group, Optiv, Bishop Fox or my own and outsource an audit, because they don&#x27;t have the resources for an in-house security team just yet.<p>To answer your other question, startups will start getting audits once they reach their second or third round of funding, though the savvier ones might do it once they have substantial enough seed funding. There is a sweet spot where startups know they need security but won&#x27;t bother with an in-house team - that&#x27;s where you market yourself. Alternatively, you can market your services to enterprise companies with both an in-house team <i>and</i> regular independent audits, but that&#x27;s harder for a beginning firm.<p>That&#x27;s just the broad strokes though. Some startups need to prove security competency earlier on; some try to hire security teams quickly.<p>More importantly, how much security experience do you have? What is your network of potential clients like?<p><i>edited for formatting</i>",1452442773

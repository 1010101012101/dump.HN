Now move on!""</i><p>The way I think about it is this: in order for the successes to occur, there have to be failures. In a lottery, it is the unsuccessful tickets that fund the winner.<p>I'm not saying that running a business has as much to do with chance as a lottery (although there is certainly a strong element of chance) but the way I see it is that I'm taking part in an exercise and just because I don't end up the ""winner"" doesn't make my part less important to the exercise as a whole.<p>I think this can be re-applied to one's whole life: you start to feel less a sense of individualism and victimisation and more like ""shit just happens, let's have some fun in the meantime"".",1313146735

2876775,comment,2875211,2876593,7,0,seabee,,,"Are you being serious?<p>Public health care. Free state education (which is generally of a good standard, but a waste if you are not self-motivated). Council-provided housing, though supply is short due to failing to replenish the housing stock since right to buy in the 80s. A fairly comprehensive benefit system which scales with number of children. Healthy food is cheaper than junk.<p>The last one (self-respect) is mostly what determines whether you decide to take advantage of all the UK welfare state offers. Poor money management and general ignorance are the main reasons for the poor having big TV's, satellite service and gadgets, yet failing to pay their bills and their friends. Or getting into crippling credit card debt.<p>So really if you want to be accurate, its the rich doing their best to keep the poor stupid so they may keep the stupid poor. Sure, there are some really dumb things with welfare in e.g. the hoops you jump through to receive jobseekers allowance but its not as if the opportunities aren't there...<p>Edit: I see you were talking about mental medical care, which again is provisioned under the NHS. I personally know of NHS services in East London for this, some of which started due to this initiative: <a href=""http://www.iapt.nhs.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iapt.nhs.uk/</a> All free.

It's one of my motivations to learn information design - in hope that one day I'll put a big dashboard on the wall that will update TODOs and graph data I want to track and get feedback on (like my spendings).",1313143296

Four words from 1600 is 1600^4 permutations, which would take over 200 years to test at a 1000/second attack.<p>Sure, if we're talking about a different type of password, and 2-billion-tries-per-second attacks, it'll fall in about an hour, but simply pushing that out to six words from that dictionary will still stymie that level of attack for a couple of hundred years.

I checked out the ToC before ordering and I like the way it offers a comparison of the major existing version control systems and then includes in the comparison at the end the new version control system.  So basically it's useful to anyone who is thinking about moving to a new VCS and ""happens to mention"" the author's VCS.  I'd pay for that any day, but instead I'll just recommend the book to everybody I know... which is probably what they want...",1313143227

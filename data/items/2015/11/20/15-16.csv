It&#x27;s related to Maxwell&#x27;s demon: if the signal were exciting a large rod, a flat low energy spectrum would roughly correspond to small thermal fluctuations of the rod, which are bounded by some Carnot-like efficiency. If you can perfectly predict the fluctuations though, you can set up a system of oscillating rods coupled additively to it to absorb it&#x27;s power such that their sum approximates the Fourier spectrum of the rod. This allows you to extract work from the rod as if it were a sinusoidal signal, which does not have to obey the Carnot limit.<p>In practice this effect should be small though (for the case of Wi-Fi power).",1448034651

That lends itself to two of the most dominant features of current human culture: the suffocating smallness (or, more properly, <i>sameness</i>) with which it imbues our world, leaving the probably accurate sense that there&#x27;s nowhere to run to or hide if you don&#x27;t like what you see, and the vicious &quot;outrage cycle&quot; that reinforces a particular and very narrow ideology.  If you don&#x27;t happen to agree with that ideology, and there&#x27;s nowhere you could go instead that&#x27;s any different (and certainly not any that&#x27;s better), what&#x27;s left to you?<p>It&#x27;s not entirely fair to blame &quot;the Internet&quot; for this; as Tom Standage has described, earlier forms of communication started these trends.  But it really hasn&#x27;t been until the last 30 or 40 years that communication has been both universal and instantaneous, and those attributes are essential to the kind of feedback loop that creates what we have now.

You push something onto a queue created with library A, and then you want to read from library B (A and B are different version of the same library). Just about anything could happen (depending on how the library/language are implemented). You might get an error due to library B reading a data structure formatted for library A. Or you might get nothing back, because library B is checking for the queue in its own registry, while it exists in library A&#x27;s. Etc.<p>If there is no library-dependent state between calls, or the calls are not being mixed between libraries, you can totally do that, though. A JSON serialization library can totally be supported in that manner, for instance. The queueing library example, if it&#x27;s only being used to support other libraries or separate functionalities, such that you never have to push onto a queue in library A, and expect to be able to pop it off from a queue in library B, would work, too. But in that latter case, that&#x27;s not something the library writer can guarantee, it&#x27;s all about your own usage. So there&#x27;s a lot of potential issues.",1448033600

Hopefully you doing some of his work free&#x27;s up his time to be more productive in other areas. If your boss is a lazy PHB (Dilbert), get another job.<p>This is called loyalty, and it only really works in certain kinds of endeavors, and then only certain organizations doing them. TV shows depict loyalty a lot, the thing I notice about these shows is that the stories are always set in &quot;meat-grinder&quot; sorts of fields, and then at the tops of those fields. <i>Suits</i>, set in a high-powered corporate law firm. <i>Entourage</i>, set in Hollywood. Loyalty as a major theme to a show isn&#x27;t interesting to watch otherwise.<p>Everywhere else, an interested ladder-climber will always find that it&#x27;s way easier and cheaper to change jobs than it is to move up in one. Hence the perennial advice to move to a city, where landing jobs is like shooting fish in a barrel for the ambitious. When you run out of steam at one company, get a fresh start somewhere else. Rinse and repeat until you&#x27;re tired of moving around, then you can start the loyalty path.<p>It&#x27;s important to note that the skills you need to convince someone else that you can do a job are way different than the skills you need to convince a power broker to bequeath you with additional responsibilities and the commensurate titles and prestige. It so happens that years of experience working in organizations gives you those skills largely through osmosis.<p>I like where I am now, so I investigated the possibility of sticking around and trying to move up rather than jump to another company.

My boss specifically used the words, &quot;you&#x27;re comfortable&quot; to describe my head space when he said he&#x27;d go around and ask if anyone else needed anything to do.<p>You and everyone else can have the best of intentions, but opportunity is limited and it&#x27;s hard to make more of it. There&#x27;s only ever a limited amount of money and perks to go around, and its often politically unfeasible to start rocking a boat by democratizing something that was previously held feudally.<p>Making the decision to stay at a company is giving up easy access to opportunity in exchange for security and stability. You can always unmake that decision by leaving, often times you can even unmake it the other way, companies will take people that leave back if they like them enough, but you and only you can decide what you want more out of your time on Earth.",1448032866

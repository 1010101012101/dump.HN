The precedence there is actually<p><pre><code>    ( foo | bar ) || baz\n</code></pre>\nI.e, the pipe operator binds tighter than any of the logic operators. Also, `set -o pipefail` doesn&#x27;t cause your shell script to exit on the first error; you need `set -e` or explicit exit status checking for that. What `set -o pipefail` actually does is change the way exit status for a pipeline as a whole works. Consider the following pipeline:<p><pre><code>    foo | bar | baz\n</code></pre>\nWithout `set -o pipefail`, if either foo or bar exit non-zero, but baz exits zero, this pipeline will appear to have succeeded, because by default a pipeline gets the exit status of its last element. Ignoring errors is bad. So `set -o pipefail` makes the pipeline take the exit status of the last element that failed (if any failed).<p>Regarding `set -u`, I don&#x27;t personally use it, I just check that kind of stuff at the beginning of the script.<p>Now, on to your shell script example: in practice you&#x27;ll never see an error because both grep and sed return true even when no matching or substitution is done. You also have a useless use of cat [1] at the beginning; just use grep directly on that file.<p>I would suggest simply doing<p><pre><code>    sed -ne &#x27;s/^HomeCommunityId=//p&#x27; &quot;${EXTERNAL_VARIABLE}&quot;/adapter.properties\n</code></pre>\nfor grabbing that variable. Then see if the variable is empty with a `-z` test.<p>Hope this helps.

The engineering team for the product I work on, Google Play Music, is roughly 15% older engineers (rough guess, because I don&#x27;t actually know how old everyone is). And across google, many of the most well regarded engineers (not talking about managers) are also older folks. Should there be more older engineers? Possibly, but the population is skewed because google is growing very fast of late and the vast majority of hires come straight out of college.<p>Also keep in mind that software engineering is a tough profession, and burnout is a real issue. Many of the people I&#x27;ve worked with over the years have moved on to other careers, in high tech or in something completely unrelated. The luckier ones cashed out on stock options or IPOs, and no longer need to work for a living - they either have their own little companies where they play around or they just retire. I&#x27;d say probably 40-50% of the engineers I worked with in my 20s and 30s are no longer doing any coding.<p>Bottom line: age discrimination is generally not a problem at google. One discrimination suit means nothing - those happen all the time at every successful company, and most of them are from folks angling for a quick settlement. (I don&#x27;t know the merits of the particular case in question.)",1401388734

I can&#x27;t speak for other minorities, but a <i>lot</i> of women are experiencing discrimination from men in some way in some place in their lives. Try looking at #YesAllWomen on twitter if you want more details.<p>And so it&#x27;s meaningful to set an example that says &quot;While this profession currently predominantly male, we do accept minorities, and there are many non-white/non-male people in our industry who succeeded&quot;. <i>That</i> is what the role model part is about - clearly communicating that it&#x27;s <i>not</i> a clique.

Looking at the odd fact that by far most quarterbacks are white (75% of them right now, and the fact that it&#x27;s so low is celebrated), I think we&#x27;re far from that point.<p>But even if we leave out the debate around privilege and pretend for the moment that it doesn&#x27;t exist: Being in a minority leads to a <i>lot</i> of shared experiences. A creative woman interested in CS, but not in the field has  more in common with other women than she has with a guy interested in exploring CS.<p>There are more shared experiences the longer you share that interest, and the differences vanish.

7817716,comment,7816604,7817440,26,0,mbrubeck,,,"The cynical side of my concern is that search engines under pressure due to spammers will let niche/indie content bear the brunt of the cost, because that content is not &quot;high quality&quot; from the search engine perspective of &quot;we have valuable ad inventory that lets us monetize these searches.&quot;  Not all searches are profitable.  Similarly, &quot;sophisticated&quot; users are less lucrative because we click fewer ads.  A bias toward readily available metrics can easily lead to algorithm changes that benefit the mainstream majority while punishing various niche use cases as regretted but ultimately acceptable collateral damage.<p>The conflict is between &quot;the world&#x27;s information&quot; (mission) and &quot;the world&#x27;s information, minus some troublesome long-tail bits that few people care about and aren&#x27;t profitable anyway&quot; (business motive).<p>> why would Google employees be taking their time to coach indie website operators on how to improve their site&#x27;s rankings<p>This &quot;coaching&quot; is actually Google pushing the spam problem onto content authors, promoting &quot;solutions&quot; that benefit Google while still hurting legit publishers.  <i>&quot;Spam has gotten so bad that our algorithms can&#x27;t classify it without misclassifying you.  You can either hide some of your content as a proof that it&#x27;s not link spam, or have us hide even more on presumption that it is.&quot;</i>  Yes, this gives Google a powerful tool for weeding out fake/malicious content, but it also hurts the user experience and the mission in the long run, compared to solutions that allow for more manual review, more use of inbound link disavowal, or finer-grained penalties that target only the possibly &quot;low-quality&quot; pages without spilling over to entire sites.  Those solutions would probably shift more cost to Google, however.<p>What&#x27;s really bad is that some of Google&#x27;s recent recommendations (e.g. &quot;use the noindex robots meta tag&quot;) will remove real knowledge not just from Google but from other present and future search engines (even if those engines wouldn&#x27;t have the same problems Google did with that content).  And even if the algorithm&#x27;s limitations/errors are eventually resolved, the recommendations will live on much longer in legacy content (and in SEO folklore), meaning that some content will be erased from search <i>permanently</i> for no reason.  These are long-term costs that are borne not by Google but by users, publishers, and competing search engines.<p>Personally, I want to be able to search ALL THE THINGS even if it means that I sometimes have to wade through more crap, and that it&#x27;s harder work for the search engine to weed out people who are gaming the system.  Maybe Google can&#x27;t offer me that without degrading its more mainstream users.  Even if that&#x27;s the case, it still feels like a departure from principles (or maybe a declaration of defeat) for Google to be making that choice.  Even more so when it hurts the ability of other search engines to step in and index the stuff that Google doesn&#x27;t want.<p>The reason I want to see Google hew strictly to &quot;the mission&quot; is that it offers a way to let these big-picture issues override things that are more immediately measurable.  I know I became an extensive user of Google services mainly because of the way its mission-oriented thinking was visible in its product design choices.  That intangible feeling was more important than any particular feature.  Keeping it alive requires the ability to say, &quot;Screw it, we&#x27;re not going to go this route no matter its obvious benefits, simply because it&#x27;s not in line with the mission.&quot;  But I also know that it&#x27;s not possible to do that in every decision; even here in the non-profit, mission-driven Mozilla project, principles alone can&#x27;t win every fight.  (See <a href=""http://robert.ocallahan.org/2014/05/unnecessary-dichotomy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robert.ocallahan.org/2014/05/unnecessary-dichotomy.ht...</a> for an interesting take on this.)

Frequentist statistics is full of numbers (like p values) that can easily be confused for the probabilities that people desire. People don&#x27;t actually care that a p value of 0.05 does NOT mean that the null hypothesis has a 5% chance of being true.

The discussion is about Google&#x27;s <i>current</i> state, and Google <i>current</i> plans to deal with diversity <i>given</i> that current state. A change in circumstances (and Google going from &quot;hire every qualified person we can get our hands on&quot; to &quot;stop hiring anyone&quot; would be a radical change in circumstances) would be an occasion for a different discussion.<p>> Are you really that naive to think Google will continue to expand indefinitely?<p>I think that Google&#x27;s concerns about and options for approaching diversity would be different if Google was funding or task constrained rather than employee-pool- constrained, and that the proper focus of discussion is the real world that exists, not some speculative future that may or may not exist in the lifetime of anyone discussing it.<p>> They absolutely will hit a point when they can&#x27;t just leave the number of new hires uncapped.<p>Its almost certain that sometime before the end of human civilization that that will happen for Google, but the time to discuss whether diversity should remain a concern and what steps are appropriate to address that concern in a funding-constrained firm will be appropriate with respect to Google when that occurs. However, it isn&#x27;t the case <i>now</i>, so its just a distraction from the issue today.<p>Especially since I&#x27;m sure that -- as much as Google would hope to avoid that circumstance as long as possible -- Google would also prefer to acheive an acceptable demographic profile in its workforce before it becomes constrained in that way (and, insofar as there are business as well as humanitarian reasons for its diversity concerns, sees acheiving a good diversity profile as part of a strategy to <i>continue</i> growing in a way that does not result in them becoming resource- rather than employee-constrained.)",1401386652

For me, I have a general awareness of <i>technical book publishers</i> and their strengths.  Some examples... In general an Addison-Wesley or Morgan-Kaufmann book is better edited than an Apress book.  Also, some publishers tend to gravitate towards certain strengths such as MK&#x27;s line of books on big data & data mining.  O&#x27;Reilly and Manning publishers tend to respond very quickly to the latest technologies (some might say &quot;fads&quot;) with a topical book whereas Addison-Wesley is much more conservative.<p>Of course, there are exceptions to all of the above but the general tendencies of tech publishers can be used to signal the potential quality of a book (especially for unknown authors.)<p>I don&#x27;t think the HN crowd would be outliers by having a sense of where the various tech book publishers fit in the marketplace.",1401386639

I&#x27;m not sure how this will work out for novels, but for non-fiction I think this will be solved by authors going after very specific niches---the long tail.<p>This is unchartered publishing territory because previously publishers would never take on a niche subject because it wouldn&#x27;t make economic sales to pass it through their pipeline.<p>> fewer Strosses can make a living as an author<p>Your point about the dilution of attention and book revenue is valid, but let me partially offset it / counter it with an argument on margins. By self-publishing, authors retain 60% of the list price (say $15) as compared to 5-10% of profits (=3-5% of list price) regular publishers offer. It wouldn&#x27;t be too wrong to say authors make as little as $3 per copy sold, so if you do the math, it&#x27;s actually good for everyone:<p><pre><code>  Superstar author, monthly:\n     Previously:    10000*3    =  $30k royalties \n     In new world:   3333*15   =  $50k royalties  (assume 2/3 readership loss)\n  \n  Less known author, over the same period of time:\n     Previously:     0\n     In new world:   300*15    =  $4500  which is a make-me-wanna-write salary \n\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s not zero sum if there are gains to be had from efficiency.",1401386456

The vast majority of recurring credit card payments are sadly still done by storing an encrypted card number and decrypting it every time payment is made.<p>Adding insult to injury, most payment processing software also only conforms to the bare minimum encryption requirement meaning your credit card information is only encrypted using 3DES, keying 3 (meaning a whopping 56 bit key). You can attribute this poor security to laziness since that&#x27;s the same encryption mechanism PINpads use so the CC co devs already had that code laying around to repurpose.<p>Of course I have no idea what software Dish uses, who their processor is and what those two things allow/support. Dish may actually be using proper pay-by-reference transactions or they may not, I have no idea.<p>None of this changes the fact that a payment system where you must reveal your secret key (cc#) in order to spend is inherently flawed, poorly designed and will be frequently compromised at every link in the chain.

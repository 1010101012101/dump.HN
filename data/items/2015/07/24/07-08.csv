9940643,comment,9940123,9940373,0,0,grey-area,,,"Fast is a completely reliable transaction in seconds (as banks currently provide in many countries with CC or with transfers, or paypal does for example). Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t provide that because you need to wait for real confirmation, and it doesn&#x27;t provide a predictable time-frame for that. So it is slower than many other payment methods.<p>No cost is not accurate, because to get fast, you need to pay. Low cost is debatable but possibly accurate compared to current payment methods (though CC charges are mostly borne by the vendor, an important distinction).<p>I do think these criticisms strike to the heart of why Bitcoin will not be successful - it doesn&#x27;t compare well to other payment methods, and because of the nature of its distributed consensus and proof of work, it never will. It has some interesting ideas but also embeds some ideas about transactions which make it impossible to satisfy the requirements of most vendors/customers.<p>We will probably see a digital global currency supplanting government-backed currencies, but it needs to have very low volatility, a transparent guidance structure, a credible backer (probably corporate in today&#x27;s world), verifiable identities to prove both sides of a transaction took part and prevent fraud etc., fast and low cost transfers (BTC has the low cost bit at least at present), and most importantly of all regulated central institutions like banks or exchanges which normal people can trust to carry out business, because most people do not have the time, resources or inclination to secure their servers/computers against determined intrusion and fraud.<p>Personally I think the concepts of mining, a distributed block chain, and unique tokens which are hoarded and passed around like gold coins are fundamentally flawed and will prevent Bitcoin taking off long-term and are the cause of many of its issues like volatility. It is full of interesting ideas though and has triggered a renaissance in online payment, so I see why people find it interesting.",1437724720

9940616,comment,9940017,9940603,0,0,_delirium,,,"I agree that&#x27;s probably a factor. But I think many conservatives in these cases <i>also</i> prefer a nonprofit or dividend-type model to a more libertarian-style private-ownership model. The Tennessee-valley opposition to privatizing the TVA is an example.<p>And in Alaska, the choice isn&#x27;t only between paying out a dividend and letting the government keep the money. Alaska could simply abolish the severance tax entirely, and just let private mineral-rights owners reap the full profits. But that&#x27;s not popular at all, even among people who identify as conservative. My suspicion, besides people voting their interests (probably a significant factor) is that unlike in the case where someone creates a product through their own labor, in the case of oil extraction, there is doubt that private land or rights owners really &quot;deserve&quot; the full profits from exploiting a resource they didn&#x27;t create, but for various historical reasons happen to now own. Rather it seems to be more popular to allow them a profit on their extraction effort, but recapture some of the underlying value of the mineral asset for the people in general. (Texas also has a severance tax based on this kind of rationale, in its case used to fund government in partial lieu of an income tax.)",1437724021

There are a bunch of variants, but the general idea is a claim that everyone has a right to their share of proceeds from economic rent, especially land rent and mineral wealth, in some forms also proceeds from utility-like infrastructure. Since everyone is held to own an equal share of these by right, the revenues should be either distributed equally to everyone as &quot;shareholders&quot; (as in the Alaska dividend), or used to finance public goods.<p>There are some overlaps with socialism, especially social-democratic models of government. But clearly the full social-democratic program is nowhere near popular in conservative areas of the US. If you look at why only <i>these</i> specific ideas are popular in those areas, one commonality is that they have a Georgist feel to them.

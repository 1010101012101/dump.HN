AOL's revenue from the ISP business was dropping rapidly enough a few years ago for them to entire shift their business to online content resulting in huge short-term losses in hopes of better long term gains.  Now for TW to shift into a tiered internet that I don't see a market for does not seem like a smart move to me.",1200689952

100484,comment,100319,100414,0,0,ecommercematt,,,"I enjoyed the hell out of your WYCS essay, and the care with which you wrote it shows. I'm not contesting the arguments made in that essay. If, in this thread, however, you're contending that all ideas are completely relative, and that we don't have any right to pass judgments on them, then I have to disagree. If you're arguing that people should be allowed to speak freely in society at large, no matter how strange or offensive their ideas might be, then I agree. I don't think speech of any kind should be banned, and I fully appreciate how difficult it is to come to genuine truth. Aside from the existence of the self, what is truly knowable, anyway?<p>Be that as it may, in order to assess the quality of a community-driven site, one has to place value judgements on its content. Sometimes these value judgements fall short of perfection, but they're necessary and unavoidable.<p>It is interesting that you raised the prospect of filters yielding false positives. If you were talking about my judgement as an individual, then I'll admit that I'm blinded by the human condition, but I'd like to point out that I relied on blanket labels to avoid getting into a discussion of minutia of specific posts on Reddit. If you were referring to filters integrated into the software we'll use for our startup, our approach to avoid the ""garbage"" (we can agree that there is garbage out there, and avoiding it is a good thing, right?) is to narrow the focus of the site, rather than to build in karma-based influence restrictions and enhancements of individual users.<p>Hopefully I'll be posting a link here fairly soon, so all of my vague mumbo-jumbo will make more sense, and it'll take less imagination to see how our site could be used for negative purposes and how that might be limited.",1200688412
100483,comment,100284,100349,0,0,eas,,,"In addition to that PG article, you might also be interested in this video lecture by MIT Sloan professor Thomas Malone, where he discusses his book The Future of Work, which is right up that alley. <a href=""http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/229/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/229/</a>
Apparently he's kind of the guy behind ""e-lancing""<p>""In Thomas Malone's optimistic view of the future, the human values of creativity and freedom ultimately triumph, and business leads the way. This explosion of possibilities in work, and everyday life, will flow from the increasing ease and decreasing expense of communicating. Malone sees parallels between the emergence of democracies in political and business worlds, and technological advances in communications. He notes that in the age of the Internet, businesses are growing decentralized, markedly departing from ""command and control"" organizational models to newer environments where ""workers seek advice instead of approval.""""<p>And not to make this the longest comment in N.YC history, but to your microgeography point, you'd like this video with Sandy Pentland of MIT: <a href=""http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/494/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/494/</a><p>""Alex (Sandy) Pentland performed a unique experiment in a large German bank, tagging its employees with special badges that tracked individuals' interactions, down to head nodding, body language, and tone of voice. His research, conducted over a month, looked at how face to face interactions played into the overall organizational flow. The patterns he uncovered in the data collected from his name badges and from email and more traditional documentation, demonstrated the significance of social dynamics in workplace productivity. Certain individuals acted as information bottlenecks; others as polarizers, group thinkers, or gossip mongers. Pentland shared information about these patterns of communication with individuals.""",1200688334
100482,comment,100175,100304,0,0,Shooter,,,"Fair enough.  If that is your evaluation of the article, then that's cool. I usually try not to completely write off people that I know are smarter than I am in a particular area (Stonebraker), just because I don't understand or agree with all of their arguments.<p>I think the article is much less of a fanboy article and more of an academic ""thought provoking"" article, though.  I think their tone is a little too adversarial, but I believe they are essentially arguing that people can learn a great deal from older DBMS technologies and apply that knowledge to their applications...without always reinventing the wheel.  They're arguing that people not forget the past when they look to the future, because combining ideas from both 'camps' might lead to a better solution.  A ""Best of Both Worlds"" approach.  Where would we be now if most of the Lisp discoveries and lessons had been assimilated into the programming culture sooner, for example?<p>I personally think the original article is more in the vein of suggesting deficiencies in using MapReduce for most applications than saying it is a complete dead-end.  They acknowledge that ""MapReduce may be a good idea for writing certain types of general-purpose computations.""  They say they are excited by its fault tolerance, etc.  They just think it is being misused in many instances where other technologies are superior.  I strongly agree with them on that point: there are relatively few use cases where MapReduce is ideal.  And even when it is appropriate to use MapReduce, it should usually be augmented by other technology as well.  They cite several deficiencies in the MapReduce approach that are completely valid, and I think your 30,000 foot overview of their criticism is misleading.<p>I think too many people are missing the forest for the trees with the original article (which is partly the fault of the authors, since they could have worded some of their arguments better.) People seem to think that just because Google is doing something that it is the optimal solution...but even Google uses BigTable to get around some of the deficiencies of MapReduce.  And what is BigTable?  A column-oriented DBMS!  And who is one of the world's leading experts on and proponents of those?  Why, Michael Stonebraker, the ivory-tower moron who wants to use RDBMS for everything!<p>As bayareaguy noted:  ""You have to read the original article very closely or you'll miss their point: in terms of distributed database research, MapReduce is a step backwards.""",1200688255

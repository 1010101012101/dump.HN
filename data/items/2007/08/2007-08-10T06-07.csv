41190,story,,,2,3,benhoyt,"Any ideas why our site's getting 404s to the /undefined URL?",,"It's really strange: we're getting occasional 404 page-not-founds at the URL /undefined on our site (micropledge.com). HTTP_REFERER is set, usually to our home page, so it's not some random guy typing into his address bar. We saw who it was once when it happened, so we contacted him, but he said he didn't see anything wrong in his browser -- so it's something behind-the-scenes.<p>Haven't been able to reproduce it here, or find any answers on the web. Doesn't seem to be a specific browser. My hunch is that it's some JavaScript quirk, or possibly the Google Analytics JS code, but I'm not sure...",1186727041

The integration with the rest of the environment (LINQ, db process LCR, Visual Studio integration, async transactional queuing, one heck of a molap engine, a great etl tool and more) is just too good to give up. And it's a darned nice database to boot, with 2008 on the way being even nicer. Also, Microsoft has publicly assured customers they will continue to license per socket, not per core. While still more expensive than the free db's (duh), at least you're not stuck handing over all future Moore's law gains to Larry Ellison. ",1186726746

Some of the largest sites in the world use one, two, or all three of those databases in one way or another.  The best designed of them probably use them appropriately, and thus may have a use for both SQLite and one of MySQL or PostgreSQL.",1186726342

The button doesn't do anything, and I have no way to selectively enable (click to enable) flash on your page. It'd be best to pop up the overlay with the flash element enabled (so I can click to enable it) or at least give me a warning if I click on it with flash disabled.<p>On the tutorial, don't <i>make</i> me type ""google"" to click the start button. If I click ""Start"", that's enough. I'm generally a thorough reader and I still didn't really see that you were asking me to type ""google"" vs. just anything and the button gives no indication if you click it.<p>On the tutorial, on step 5, you say ""Click RECORD"" - there are two record buttons, and neither is highlighted. This is just as frustrating as the ""Start"" button not working in step 1.<p>On the tutorial, on step 7, your ""Publish"" button is way outside the general area all of the other interactions have been - it's not obvious what to click to continue.<p>I agree with all of kaolinite's comments regarding general polish of the website.<p>Once I actually launch the app I get two loading screens, one after the other - not a big deal, but I'd try to consolidate that if possible.<p>I have no Java plugin installed, so I just get ""Pick which window to record"" with nothing in the drop-down and no indication of what's wrong.

Especially when you consider many people in hotels are subject to international roaming fees if they resort to their mobiles.<p>Even in higher-end hotels, you get a shoddy experience, and not just this ad injection.Weird login dialogs every few hours and restricting access to one device. Outrageous fees. Lack of transparency on bookings websites about availability and pricing. And once you're online, good luck trying to watch a video or getting any work done, the connection's often too slow to do anything but check a few emails.<p>I really hope AirBNB puts pressure on the hotels to get their act together.

3806935,comment,3802515,3802515,4,0,developer9,,,"Great article until ""Obama was right in bailing out the auto industry when GM and Chrysler were going bankrupt. Because it wasnt just GM and Chrysler that were going to fail, it was an entire ripple-effect of suppliers, tool manufacturers, raw material suppliers, trucking companies and dealers that were going to go away.""<p>That's not the full reason that they did it though. It's because they were making vehicles for our military. If our country started relying solely on foreign countries for our military, they could disable our ability to replenish or grow our ground fleets.<p>But, even that is not far enough down the rabbit hole. There are enough non-government owned vehicles in the U.S. to more than make up for the lack of vehicles they would have lost, even if every other country simultaneously decided that we were the enemy, our military could use the country's existing resources (assuming we were ok with that).<p>And moreover, we are already reliant on other countries for our military and the running of our country. The only ""advantage"" of a government that pumps everyone's tax money into a select number of private companies, directly or indirectly, is that ""survival of the fittest"" is damaged. The ""disaster"" is delayed- the inevitable damage grows greater. It is the economical equivalent of forestry agencies that protected forests from forest fires, when forests naturally managed themselves via fires started by lightning strikes, such that large fires would inevitably start and be uncontrollable. Large bailouts can cause incredibly bad things to happen.<p>So, the question is, why did they do it? Band-aids and politics. It was not long-term thinking. And that is the story of our government. For the most part, no one is willing to make the political sacrifice for long-term gain. What we need now is for someone to help make government stable and predictable again, and to reduce the amount of red-tape it takes for U.S.-based businesses to succeed. But, it is going to take a disaster for that to happen- a disaster that will be much worse because of bailouts and other shenanigans. But, as for now, we will live in the growing forests our forest rangers protect for us.",1333716563

Even if you don't make the switch to Dvorak, which the TypeMatrix makes trivial--like the old ""DVORTYboards"" the switch is done at the keyboard, no messing with translation on the computer side--the non-offset rows of keys will give your hands a break. It does have CTRL where IBM keyboards put it rather than where God/DEC intended (next to the left pinky), but most of us have had to get used to that, alas.<p>They offer keyboard skins designed to fit the keyboard: either translucent (with no labels, to work with all variants), translucent with labels, or black with labels. An anecdote: the translucent skin I first got with the keyboard had worn through in spots, so I ordered two of the black Dvorak skins. They arrived, and happily fit far more snugly over the keyboard than the first had--but after a few minutes use, though, something was clearly wrong. Turned out I'd pressed the num shift key, but the skin covered the LED that would have shown the problem. A call to TypeMatrix turned up that it was a communications issue with the company that did the skins--they recommended a leather punch of appropriate diameter as a temporary fix, and said that once they have corrected skins, I should contact them with explanation and email address, and they'd send replacements back at no cost, no questions asked. IMHO, that's service. (Now if they'd just get it out of their head that blue for labels for Fn functions is some kind of standard and make them orange on the black skins, it would be perfect--though they are aware of that issue as well.)<p>UPDATE: Once I am again among the employed, I will ask my employer whether I can bring in my own keyboard (just as I'll ask about being able to bring in my spare Logitech trackball to use instead of a mouse), and if I can, buy a second TypeMatrix for the purpose.",1333715847

Das uses cherry mx, which are spring buckling switches (like the model m), and are much cheaper then topres, even though they cost more to produce. I am also a big fan of cherry switches, but I know many huge keyboard nerds who swear up and down that topres are the best there is.",1333714198

10174248,comment,10173260,10173685,0,0,dmgbrn,,,"As a recovering alcoholic, I can confidently say that this is not correct.  Although many alcoholics get in trouble by drinking too much too fast (this seems like an acceptable definition of binge drinking that takes tolerance into account), the key feature of alcoholism is addiction -- that in the face of the consequences, alcoholics do not stop.  At the height of my drinking, I was going through about two liters of vodka a day.  Despite this, I tried and usually succeeded not to lose control of my behavior.  After all, getting in trouble jeopardizes your ability to get drunk, and as an addict, every action I took and decision I made was driven by a simple principle: don&#x27;t let anything come between me and booze.",1441439820

We&#x27;re talking about the difference between moving on with your life with a guilty conscience, vs. having your entire life financially ruined due to <i>injuring</i> someone. I make $80k per year. If my country mandated > $100k per year for injuring someone, that&#x27;s literally the rest of my life destroyed. I could not financially recover for the rest of my life. Ever. For what? An honest accident in which someone&#x27;s leg is broken and they feign permanent disability?<p>Imagine you broke someone&#x27;s leg. Would you rather kill the person and pay $1000, or spend the rest of your life in prison? Letting the person live and paying them $1000 isn&#x27;t an option. You either get away scott-free, or ruin your life. I can completely understand a culture in which the reality of the consequences makes people choose the lesser punishment.<p>The solution isn&#x27;t to increase the punishment for killing someone on the street. The solution is to abolish the ridiculous costs associated with merely injuring someone, especially if that injury comes from an accident.<p>Of course what&#x27;s absolutely a joke is people acting all aghast about another country&#x27;s culture from behind their white picket fences. You do realize that if you were born in their country, you would have the exact same perspective? What the fuck is with this high and mighty bullshit? Your upbringing in a privileged society doesn&#x27;t make you better than those from less privileged societies, it just makes you privileged. Be thankful your day-to-day routine doesn&#x27;t involve having to worry about the possibility of having to kill someone in order to keep your pristine life intact.",1441439677

For the moment, it sounds legal, (IANAL) but it also sounds like the corporate system was not meant to be run this way.<p>In short, what is generally done (and also in this case) is that when you buy a company, you can have the company borrow money, and transfer that money to the PE owner. You can do this because you have good bank connections, and the company is a large going concern that is used to borrowing some money from its lenders. I couldn&#x27;t just open a company tomorrow and fleece the bank by paying it all to myself.<p>Our corporate system grew out of the industrial revolution. There was a need to finance large undertakings in a way that wouldn&#x27;t be ruinous if it went wrong. Gathering a bunch of money from investors wasn&#x27;t a new idea (various &quot;Indian&quot; trading companies) but limited liability was seen as a necessity for risk taking. During the 1800s a bunch of western countries created the modern forms of the law (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_liability"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_liability</a>).<p>With the PE type model, you can take over a company, load it with debt, and transfer risk-free money to a parent fund. The company doesn&#x27;t necessarily go bankrupt, but it&#x27;s more likely if you take a lot of debt. If the company does well, great. You can take that account statement to your bank and... pile more debt on.<p>Most people who run a company will not behave like this. The idea is not to have a company that is constantly on the brink, but to pay out some dividends when it&#x27;s safe to do so.",1441438309

You&#x27;ll see it used in papers, you&#x27;ll see it as the basis of real world projects, etc. This presents a problem if the aims of the project are different to the how the project is used.<p>The biggest flag for me is, as pointed out in the blog post, when the project doesn&#x27;t even know how the part of speech (POS) model was trained[1]. That means a lack of reproducibility[2]. Given POS tags are the first level of almost any NLP task, this is strongly troubling.<p>[1]: &quot;Where did the NLTK pos_tag model come from?&quot; <a href=""https://github.com/nltk/nltk/issues/1063"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/nltk/nltk/issues/1063</a><p>[2]: The POS tags from NLTK are used for many papers and research - see <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_ylo=2015&q=nltk&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"" rel=""nofollow"">https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_ylo=2015&q=nltk&hl=en&...</a>",1441437075

My quick impressions of Coddee:<p>- I don&#x27;t understand the &quot;Get realtime revision feed&quot; feature.  What does it mean to push snapshots of pull requests to me?  By email?  Or do you just mean the app&#x27;s UI syncs with the state on GitHub in real time, like Reviewable?<p>- Organizing files sounds appealing on the surface, and I actually set up Reviewable to be able to do it but didn&#x27;t finish implementing the feature for my MVP.  I opened an issue for it and, in the ~1 year since launch, not a single user has said they&#x27;d like to have it.  You may be overestimating the feature&#x27;s appeal.<p>- I was interested in trying Coddee out on my own public repos, but you ask for the full private `repo` scope up front so I bailed.  I realize it&#x27;s only an MVP, but I think this is one thing you can&#x27;t skimp on if you want people to actually try it out.  Check out how Reviewable does progressive authorization -- I&#x27;m happy to explain how to implement that if it&#x27;s not obvious.<p>Amusingly, I notice that we&#x27;ve made some similar infrastructure choices: real-time DB (Meteor / Firebase) and SemanticUI.  Heh.",1441437033

His beautiful story, among others like his, will inspire people to be more open about their mental health and hopefully in the process inspire a better future.<p>Entrepreneurship is not the only way to make the world a better place, and neither is an incredibly high level of success (as Fish has had).

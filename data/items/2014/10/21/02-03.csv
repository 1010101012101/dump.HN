These block updates in turn may generate yet more block updates.<p>There are two ways to make look-up or other utility calls with this fact: by either feeding in raw integer values based on the original values, or by allocating 6 additional objects. In both cases, you need to maintain your original reference position when generating the additional values, because the position is needed to generate all the values, so can&#x27;t be changed to generate the first one. The integers being passed at a low level saves on the amount of objects being allocated.<p>This has the potential to end up generating a lot of objects in response to certain kinds of events in the game world.",1413860342

It may be a component, but there has to be much more, because what backpropogation can do is fairly well characterized mathematically now and is not sufficient to build anything like a human brain.

You are certainly correct, Apple is much more directly involved with in-app purchases, so they also take much more ownership and responsibility for it. (Though I would also argue that this has a lot to do with the status quo. In-app purchases were quite new and there were no expectations about how to deal with them and who gets what. Credit card transactions are old and established and to get in on them you have to be competitive when it comes to fees and at least as convenient.)",1413859906

For kids under 18, their parents almost universally buy them cheap $500-700 laptops at Costco. They&#x27;re basically a yearly disposable item at that price (though most of those same kids have iPhones). None of my friend&#x27;s kids in college seem to have changed that purchasing habit since it&#x27;s pretty sensible.<p>If you gathered all my friends and family together with all their computers, probably <15% would have Macs. Of the people with Macs, only myself and one other person work in tech.<p>At my local coffeeshops, about half of the people there mess around on some kind of tablet, of the other half, most (maybe 90%) are on corporate Windows machines or Surface tablets (they&#x27;re really popular around here with the corporate sales types for some reason). And then I and maybe 1 other guy or a college aged kid with a 3 generation old used Macbook are the only people running any version of OS X.<p>I use a Mac because it&#x27;s what my work issued to me - a West Coast based startup btw. I&#x27;m about to change companies soon and I already know my new place is going to issue me a Windows machine.<p>I live in the wealthiest town in the wealthiest county in the United States. Most of the neighboring counties are also in the top 10. My county is also in the regional home to one of the 5 largest tech industries in the United States.<p>Welcome to the world outside of the SV bubble.",1413859871

8485703,comment,8485480,8485480,0,0,jenmcewen,,,"Excellent question. Five years ago, I started my company with my partner. Before that, I joined his first startup. All in all, we&#x27;ve been working together and living together for almost 10 years. Our families are close and we have the same group of friends. Basically, we&#x27;re around each other all. the. time.<p>Both our current company and our last one were in the adult space (sex toy design and manufacturing, and our adult mobile app store). For a few years we ran both companies simultaneously, mostly from home in a room that was both our bedroom and office (because 1. #startuplife and 2. adult startups don&#x27;t usually get funding that affords us office space). We even moved to a small factory town in China for a couple of years to lead a group of designers and engineers and oversee manufacturing, where we had no friends aside from each other.<p>Sounds maddening, doesn&#x27;t it? Except it isn&#x27;t.<p>Some might say there are a lot of land mines here. Having virtually no separate life from your partner is dangerous, working in the adult space can be hazardous to your sex life, the pressures of running a company can turn you against each other. But only you and your partner know how you tick together. I believe that as long as both of you are putting your all into it (the relationship and the business) AND you genuinely love and admire your partner for who they are, vice and virtue, it can be an incredibly rewarding experience. You&#x27;ll both be working for the same dream personally and professionally. Remember some of the greatest companies in the world are family-owned.<p>Things I would look out for are not so much about what your partner does or their personality traits, but more about how you both are together. How do you argue? How do you make up? Do you turn to each other when you&#x27;re under stress? Do you value each other&#x27;s input? Do you inspire each other? Can you tell each other when the other is slipping up? Can you handle harsh criticism from the person you&#x27;re most vulnerable to?<p>If you haven&#x27;t already, you need to learn how to argue. Say what you mean, criticize what they do not who they are, and when you&#x27;re done, apologize right away. Both of you. Actually, both of you should get used to apologizing a lot. I&#x27;ve found that because you&#x27;re under a lot of stress, the smallest jab can become a war wound. Likewise, offer accolades often too. Unlike traditional business partnerships, you don&#x27;t get a lot of emotional distance when you work with your significant other. I&#x27;m not suggesting you coddle each other either. You need to learn how to give and take criticism with the understanding that it can be emotionally charged and received.<p>You should inspire each other and feel accountable to each other to work efficiently and effectively. If either of you don&#x27;t feel this way about the other, I&#x27;d advise against working together because inevitably one or the other will feel they&#x27;re pulling all the weight. You don&#x27;t get extra leeway because you&#x27;re sleeping with your business partner.<p>Speaking of sex, embrace the quickie. Because, let&#x27;s face it, you&#x27;re not gonna have a lot of time all the time.<p>Lastly, and importantly, don&#x27;t shit with the door open. Also, take a shower, brush your teeth, put on pants. Keep some of the little mystery you have left. :)",1413859785
8485702,comment,8484847,8484847,0,0,lstamour,,,"I had a brief period of RSI while playing video games in my teens and forced myself to switch to Colemak as a Microsoft-style &quot;natural&quot; keyboard wasn&#x27;t enough. The Colemak did the trick, until 2 years ago when I suddenly had terrible pain in my fingers and wrists for about two weeks. It eventually disappeared as I began to learn how to use an Kinesis keyboard and experimented with an RF-based Evoluent VerticalMouse 4 or a Kensington SlimBlade Trackball. Adjusting my chair and posture helped enormously also. I eventually discovered the source of the mysterious pain when I tried to solve a Rubik&#x27;s Cube and it flared up again. Turns out, I&#x27;d spent the weekend before my 2 weeks of misery at a hackathon that featured Rubik&#x27;s Cubes also and I&#x27;d spent time learning how to solve one. I do really want to experiment with voice, but these darn open concept offices ... As for gestures, Kinect might come in handy, it also does voice and can focus on one person of many for voice recognition. But I&#x27;d almost rather learn a custom, chorded ten-key keyboard than speak every semicolon ... Oh and the trick with the Cherry MX blue &quot;clicky&quot; keyboards is that you don&#x27;t actually have to press as hard as people normally push the keys. Pressing harder strains your hands further, so the audible and tactile &quot;click&quot; feedback helps train your fingers to not push as hard -- at least, that&#x27;s my two cents on them. I like it, but not enough to switch from a nicer, concave layout like the Kinesis. Makes a good backup keyboard though, as I can&#x27;t afford two concave keyboards.",1413859763

The only question is, can they survive in that form (and over what distances), such that they can land on a host and infect.<p>Not only does the virus have to survive drying out, but it has to be able to make it past the mucous protecting your upper respiratory tract and and infect cells there. Viruses that have evolved this capable are very specialized--most viruses are not transmitted this way.<p>There has never been a recorded case of a virus evolving a completely new transmission mode. We have never seen a virus that wasn&#x27;t previously airborne &quot;go airborne&quot;, and we have have no evidence that Ebola can be transmitted this way right now. In fact we have plenty evidence that it can&#x27;t be transmitted this way--if it could be, there would already be millions of cases not thousands.<p>If Ebola were capable of the same kind of airborne transmission as measles and smallpox, previous outbreaks would already have spread around the globe and killed millions or billions of people.<p>There are so many things that could wipe out civilization: super volcanoes, comet impacts, nuclear war.

It&#x27;s interesting how your lack of trust for things made you become socialist, while my lack of trust for people made me develop anarcho-capitalist tendencies. I guess everyone&#x27;s political philosophy tends to stem from their core personality traits. Interesting.<p>My issue with the concept of centralized power in the society is that it has a tendency to consolidate over time and if left unchecked, tyranny is almost inevitable. Sure, you trust your government now, but nation-states generally have a very ugly history of oppressing and even exterminating portions of their population every once in a while. I just don&#x27;t believe that they can be trusted not to do it again. Not everyone is a good person, and many people in the higher rungs of power tend to have psychopathic tendencies.<p>So at the end of the day, you don&#x27;t trust your physical assets not to betray you, but you tend to trust the society you live in. My mindset is completely opposite: I don&#x27;t think that people can be trusted not to do bad things. You mentioned bitcoin, and I think this is one of the elements that it solves almost perfectly: it eliminates the need for trust, if used correctly. Strong gun rights solve the same problem, they almost completely eliminate the need for trust: I don&#x27;t have to trust the society to respect my property rights, I just have to trust that most people are not crazy enough to try to get themselves shot.<p>I think socialism is a nice concept and I think that the idea of helping the less fortunate is commendable. The problem is that it has to rely on the coercive element (uniformed men with guns showing up at your door) if you disagree with the system.<p>Not to drag this out much longer; as someone who strongly believes in non-violence, self-ownership, self-governance and rejects most forms of collectivism, I can&#x27;t agree with pointing guns at people in order to create a safety net for others. It defeats the spirit of charity and looks more like extortion and robbery.

While the net time overhead will probably always be greater than mark-and-sweep&#x27;s (although there are optimizations which can make them quite similar), mark-and-sweep has the disadvantage of causing infrequent, long pauses rather than a predictable uniform slowness. Reference counting is used in Python (which also has mark-and-sweep to detect reference cycles), C++ in the form of shared_ptr<T>, Rust as Rc<T>, and objective c/swift (and certianly many more).<p>Compile time memory management refers to things like escape and ownership analysis. Escape analysis finds locals that never escape the scope they&#x27;re allocated in, directly or indirectly, and allocates them on the stack rather than the heap. It&#x27;s used in openJDK and probably other major JVMs, and required by the Go standard. Ownership analysis verifies that there only ever exists one live reference to an object in memory, so that a deallocation can be statically inserted whenever it leaves scope, so it doesn&#x27;t become garbage. I have only seen it used in languages where there are explicit ownership annotations, such as Rust and C++.<p>To be sure, these are not the only forms of compile time memory management, but they&#x27;re probably the most versatile.",1413857790

However on a blue or a brown there is a tactile &quot;bump&quot; when the press is registered.

8485567,comment,8485180,8485337,0,0,Skinney,,,"For .NET you should really read about structs, which allocates on the stack instead of the heap, and thus avoids the GC most of the time. Oracle is working on a struct implementation for Java 9 or Java 10.<p>Using an arena/buffer/cache in Java and .NET is not unheard of, and is a good way of avoiding allocations, and thus postponing collections. An arena will, however, increase your live memory which means that when a collection finally does happen, it will take longer. The arena will probably be promoted to the oldgen quickly though, so the collector shouldn&#x27;t scan it to often.<p>&quot;if nothing points into this entire arena dump it in one chunk&quot; -> is more or less how a GC works, so you get that for free. The way the GC does it, is that it scans everything that is live and considers everything not scanned as garbage, which is then collected. The beautiful part of this, is that even if you have allocated 1Gb of memory, you only pay for what is live. If you have 200mb of live memory, collection will be constant regardless of how much garbage you have, whether it is 1Gb or 2Gb of garbage. Increasing the size of memory of course makes collections happens less often.<p>Your point regarding JIT is irrelevant in this particular case, as this case is exclusively related to the GC. We would be talking about the same potential speed improvements here with or without a JIT. That being said, you are also wrong.<p>A JIT can produce faster code than any pre-compiler, due to there being more information available, and because a JIT can easily &quot;undo&quot; compiled code, allowing it to experiment with code that can fail in certain rare cases, but most of the time is vastly faster. Mono, the open source .NET implementation, can be pre-compiled using LLVM (originally a C/C++ compiler), but using the JIT produces faster code.<p>The reason Java and .NET is &quot;slow&quot; for idiomatic (not higly optimized, which most code isn&#x27;t) code, is due to the GC, which causes the application to freeze at certain intervals. This problem increases the larger live memory you have. A GC is probably faster overall compared to manual memory management though, the problem with GCs today is that they de-allocate (garbage collect) all at once, instead of de-allocating memory once said memory becomes garbage, which evens things out a bit.<p>That being said, there are of course downsides to a JIT. It takes time before the JIT is &quot;warm&quot;, which is to say it takes time before most of the code in the application is compiled. If you have applications that run for a short amount of time (I think Java&#x27;s JIT compiles functions that are run 32 times or more), like shell scripts, they get no performance benefit of using a JIT. Another thing is memory use. Since a JIT compiles code as it goes, and nothing is pre-compiled, the JIT has to store compiled code in memory. So a JIT will naturally use more memory than a pre-compiled program, and a GC normally ads to this.",1413856823

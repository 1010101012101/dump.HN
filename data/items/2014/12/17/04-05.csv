8761125,comment,8761088,8761088,0,0,bbcbasic,,,"I would recommend first seeing if it is worth your while. You may find that the freelancing rates you get will be much less than your day job, once you take into account the time and money you spend on attracting clients.<p>One way to do this is via a minimum viable product. E.g. print a flyer and offer a price that is reasonable to you, and post it to 1000 businesses, see what response you get.<p>IANAL, but you can probably worry about the contracts and invoicing once you get an order. In-fact start off with small jobs, send them a quote and just get them to pay in advance. Send an email invoice is probably good enough. Not sure what country you are in, but usually you can do a small amount of business without registering as long as you declare it on your tax return. But research this.",1418791975

Some more successfully than others.<p>A few that I sometimes read:<p>ACM <i>Queue</i>: <a href=""http://queue.acm.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://queue.acm.org/</a>. Online-only, free. Focus is largely on software engineering and some related areas (sysadmin, devops, architecture, reliability engineering, etc.). Probably the closest to a <i>Dr. Dobbs</i> style magazine of the ones I list here, with mostly industry authors.<p><i>Communications of the ACM</i>: <a href=""http://cacm.acm.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cacm.acm.org/</a>. Most recent issue is free online; print subscription w/ digital back-issue access is $99/yr. Mix of academic and industry articles, leaning more academic, but written in a more accessible and concise style than a typical CS journal. The print version also includes some articles from online-only ACM publications (like <i>Queue</i>).<p><i>AI Magazine</i>: <a href=""http://www.aaai.org/Magazine/magazine.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aaai.org/Magazine/magazine.php</a>. Issues >1 yr old are open-access online; new issues are subscription-only. Print+digital subscription is $145/yr. A bit like <i>CACM</i>, in being journal-ish but with an aim at more readable general-interest articles. Some insider-ish news/column type stuff as well (reports on conferences and workshops, etc.).<p>You may or may not be happy with any of those. The move towards a more magazine-style format is pretty new, and I think still being experimented with. I personally like glancing through and reading parts of <i>CACM</i> and <i>AI Magazine</i>, and less often <i>Queue</i>.

Additionally, all logins on area51 between Dec. 12th and Dec. 15th were logged in plaintext. While the hashing algorithm utilized in phpBB will make it difficult to obtain those passwords, you should not take any chances.<p>A bit of clarification should be given. The staff&#x27;s login information was stolen, allowing someone to get a dump of the database containing user info. What kind of login information was stolen? Is this an shell account, was an SSH key stolen, was this an admin panel account?<p>Secondly, &quot;all logins [...] were logged in plaintext&quot;.

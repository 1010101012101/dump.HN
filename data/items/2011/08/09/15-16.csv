2864484,comment,2861545,2861566,1,0,raberga,,,"Thanks for your comment. Let me try to give you a few examples of things we do better than Scholar:<p>a) Navigation over the results\nWhen you search in Scholar you get a list of papers but you cannot navigate through the details of a paper, for example, click on an author to see his/her papers. On the other hand, using Odysci, the search results have all the data linked and right there, so you can click on authors, click on the conference, click on the conference series (to see papers for a all years of a given conference).\nAlong the same lines, we can filter and sort the search results by relevance, date, citations, and publication type (e.g, journal, conference). Scholar does not do that.<p>b) Advanced Search\nWe have some interesting new ways to search using our operator '@'. For example, you can search for papers by a given author while he/she worked at a given place. Say, you want to search for papers published by Leslie Lamport while working at SRI: you would use as search string 'lamport@SRI'. Or search for papers published at the DAC Conference (Design Automation Conference) when it was held in San Francisco, you would search for 'venue:DAC venue@""San Francisco""'. In Scholar, the advanced search facilities are less powerful.<p>c) Best Papers\nWe collected the information related to Best Paper Awards at hundreds of conferences and we make that available through advanced search. For example, to find all the Best Papers published at DAC conferences, you would search for 'venue:DAC bp:true'. This is something unique to Odysci.<p>d) BibTex Generation\nIn Scholar you can generate Bibtex, one paper at a time. This can get very boring if you need to collect multiple references. In Odysci, you can select multiple papers, even through multiple searches, and generate BibTex for all of them in one shot.<p>e) Handling of accents in non-English words\nTry searching for an author name with accents in Scholar. You'll see that their handling of accents during search is limited. In Odysci we handle accents seamlessly.<p>There are other things which we think we have an edge over Scholar but I'll stop here. Your comments are welcome.<p>Thanks (and I'll follow your advice and add some of these advantages to our home page).",1312905566

2864466,comment,2864123,2864123,3,0,kenjackson,,,"I think this author confuses good writing with wit.  In opinions clarity is extremely important.  The author says, ""The Courts best writers tend to do their most striking work in dissent, unconstrained by the need to pacify their colleagues.""  Completely untrue.  It's just in the dissent when justices tend to focus a lot less on legal clarity and more on emotional prose.<p>With that said, the author is correct that Kagan's prose is quite good.  Not for which he front-loads this piece with (like that horrible Scalia quote), but because of what is on the next page -- legal and logical clarity.<p>Although its disappointing to hear no mention of law clerks and writing style.  While the amount of actual opinion writing done by law clerks varies from one justice to the next, it's almost certainly the case that they do a good portion of the draft writing for the majority of justices.<p>Not sure of the relevance to HN though.",1312905283

Because that's not how loser pays works :) You don't pay a million dollars a day, you pay a reasonable price instead; they pay the rest. Also, loser pays is not decided on the whole case, but on specific subcases. So the suing party is less likely to use the shotgun approach where they throw every claim and the kitchen sink in, in the hope that they at least win something. Also, if you claim $1M damages, and the judge awards you $1k, that counts as a (partial) loss.

Maybe I'm oversensitive to this sort of thing as a game developer, but it seems to me worthwhile to address an incentive system which encourages people to write suboptimal posts that use these ""rhetorical tricks"".<p>I'm not advocating for the abolition of self-moderation, karma systems, etc. -- I'm just saying that the systems in place are rudimentary and leave much to be desired.",1312904730

For comparison, here's my take on collections in PHP, inspired originally as much by Underscore.js as it was by Doctrine's version: <a href=""https://github.com/xi-project/xi-collections"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/xi-project/xi-collections</a><p>Unfortunately, there's not much in the way of documentation as of now, but a look at the API should prove illuminating. For starters, the API is meant to be inherently both chainable and extensible with room for implementations based on eg. SPL classes. The idea is for the collections not to be throwaways for intermediate processing but to instead grow into a part of your application's internal API. Although the code should be in perfect working order (we're using it in one production system currently), the concept is a bit experimental at this stage.

That's the good news.<p>The bad news is that the comments that I make that get lots of votes tend to be on bike-shedding topics - things that everyone has an opinion on, such as sexual harrassment in the community, or military toys, or HN meta-discussions.  Posts that I consider authoritive (and there <i>are</i> _some_ subjects on which I can talk authoritively!) rarely get many points, typically just 3 or 4.  In my opinion, it is this tendency that drives the reddit-isation of social news sites.<p>So, how can we keep the good effects of points (keeping the tone polite), and get rid of the bike-shedding?  Well, personally I think it would be good if you got a point for each comment/subcomment made off of your comment.  Comments can be flagged with a category:inflammatory/abusive/off-topic. Each flag loses you a point. Points are only visible to the author of a comment. Flag categories are tracked separately so that the author of a comment can see if they are getting flagged for being off-topic, or poor tone, or whatever.<p>I would like to be able to say that we shouldn't care about points, but they really have helped me in making my posts more informative and less inflammatory, so I think they do have some benefit.

My co-founder is at this time is contributing part-time. He will be keeping his job (safety net for investment). \nThis is our first time endeavor into a startup. \nOur idea is still very rough and would evolve as we build the product (as expected). Right now we just have quick proof of concepts and simple functional prototypes.<p>I had a few questions, that I am hoping some of you could shed some light on:<p>- We are not planning to register our company yet, as we don't have a MVP. The plan is in the next 6-8months we can churn out a beta and then try to register the company (in USA). We do have our domain parked though. Is it normal for a startup to just go with a domain as its identity or do you folks register a company when you start off? We don't plan to put much on the website anyway until the beta.<p>- At this point our venture is completely self funded. In fact the cost to build is mostly the cost in terms of our time. Does this make our venture as a pre-seed startup? I am a bit confused about the startup stages jargons. Is there a definitive guide to it?<p>- Is it a good idea to keep track of expenses (assuming labor is also an expense?). Will it help in evaluations?<p>- What is the lifecycle most of you have seen with a startup? As I understand -> \n	1) Conceptualize \n	2) Create a minimum viable product/service \n	3) Self-promote, word of mouth via networdk about the product. Gather some userbase (paid preferrably).\n	4) For expanding, look for funding either from Angel investors or seed investors. YC is another option if we can make the cut. \n	5) ...\n	(Any step or order that I am missing?)<p>- Other than putting in more than 18*7 hours of work into building the product, most of which will be time spent writing code, is there something else to know and keep in mind? Some process that I am overlooking?<p>- We are users of what we are building and find a need for a product like this. Our current market research is based on how to plug the void that is there today. We are also actively looking at current players in the market, identifying their strenghts and weaknesses. We plan to ask our friends to help test stuff as we build and get their feedback constantly. Are there other ways of doing market research? Is it even worth it?<p>cheers!",1312904690

The airlines created 'milers' who are folks who spend time figuring out ways to keep their executive memberships current by having enough miles.<p>The second is the notion of awards and 'achievements' which provide ego reinforcement for folks who might otherwise be appalled at how much time they are spending on an activity. This provides a convienient rationalization path so that folks don't say ""I just wasted three hours on the TMZ site, instead they got three 'oscars' for finding all the Paula Abdul stories in under three hours.""[1] Its a rationalization that they 'achieved' something by investing that time.<p>Affinity programs, (such as airline miles, green stamps, etc) are pretty straight forward since they give information that the customer has done a certain volume of business with you, you can afford to give them a discount (post facto) by discounting stuff with affinity 'points.' Achievement / Titles type programs are a way to tap into the human rationalization engine and generally only make the consumer feel better (or less bad) about the poor value they have received.<p>[1] Its an entirely fictitious example, only the web site, TMZ, is real and it really is a complete waste of anyone's time :-)",1312904360

Even though I understand all the little bits, I can’t understand them fast enough to get the big picture. And the same thing happens in programming.

8403949,comment,8402859,8403815,11,0,kalid,,,"Wow, thanks for the plug and the kind words! Glad to hear the site is helping -- most of the time I miss the intricacies too, and end up adding things years later [after a re-read] or in response to a comment from the article.<p>As a more general reply to the article, I was fortunate enough to work with Prof. Oakley on her Coursera Class (<a href=""https://class.coursera.org/learning-001/lecture"" rel=""nofollow"">https://class.coursera.org/learning-001/lecture</a>, I&#x27;m the last guest interview at the bottom) and I really, really like her learning strategy.<p>Her article didn&#x27;t use the exact phrase &quot;deliberate practice&quot; but I think that captures the essence of what she means by repetition. You need enough conceptual understanding to make sure you&#x27;re following the path correctly, but then you want to practice -- at the edge of your comfort zone, with feedback, etc. -- to make sure it&#x27;s really clicking.<p>It&#x27;s really easy to fool yourself into thinking &quot;I&#x27;ve got this&quot; when it&#x27;s untested. In my own case, I realized I didn&#x27;t &quot;get&quot; imaginary numbers and exponents when I couldn&#x27;t estimate a^b [a raised to the bth power] in my head with equal fluency for all numbers a and b. I had never really tested every type of number in every type of exponent position (base and power).<p>For example,<p>3^4 => this should be a positive real number greater than 1<p>3^(-4) => this should be a positive real number, very close to 0.<p>3^i => Hrm.<p>i^i => Uh oh.<p>I knew that unless I had fluency with all of these scenarios, I didn&#x27;t truly &quot;get&quot; exponents or complex numbers. Sure, maybe I had a baby version where I could use them in well-defined ways, but I had a subconscious fear of i appearing as a base and/or exponent. I had to challenge myself and practice thinking through the various permutations before I recognized the gaps. Then I had to deepen my conceptual understanding, and practice again.<p>(For the previous questions, 3^i should be a complex number on the unit circle, maybe around 50 or 60 degrees, but less than 90, and i^i should be a real number, greater than 0 but less than 1. I can estimate these without calculating them, see <a href=""http://betterexplained.com/articles/intuitive-understanding-of-eulers-formula/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://betterexplained.com/articles/intuitive-understanding-...</a> for more details.)<p>Again, thanks for the mention!",1412297877

8403945,comment,8403894,8403894,1,0,ggchappell,,,"This is, I think, an interesting topic, but there are a few things I find troubling/puzzling about the article:<p>(1) It makes a big deal out of small differences.<p>> While computer scientists may make the most money right out of school, business is a more lucrative path in the long run. The 95th percentile of business majors (including graduate degrees) in terms of salary make $4.23 million over a lifetime, compared to $3.93 million for computer science majors, according to data collected by The Hamilton Project.<p>Okay, 7.6% more. Wow. The differences in the &quot;strongly agree&quot; percentages are a bit higher, but still not that big. I&#x27;m wondering whether the latter differences might be <i>entirely</i> chalked up to cultural differences in the fields that make people assign different meanings to &quot;strongly agree&quot; and &quot;deeply interested&quot;.<p>(2) Looking at that 7.6% salary difference again, I have to wonder whether it&#x27;s even correct. Part of the point of a business degree (or so I thought) is that you get a chance at the high levels of corporate leadership, where you get to make the big bucks. And yet, the <i>95th percentile</i> of business majors makes barely more than the same percentile of C.S. majors? That doesn&#x27;t sound right.<p>And that 95th percentile makes $4.23 million over their entire lifetime. Counting the working life as 42 years, that&#x27;s just a hair over $100,000/year. Sounds seriously low to me. We&#x27;re supposed to believe that only 5% of business majors make more than $100,000/year?<p>Or maybe business degrees are just a gigantic racket. But somehow I doubt that, too.",1412297789

The information comes from JPM&#x27;s (mandatory) SEC filings. I forget the time frame but stuff like this (information that could reasonably be expected to have a material impact on the stock price) has to be reported within a pretty narrow window of becoming known to management, like 72 hours or so.<p><i>The market will quickly sort things out if it has the appropriate information.</i><p>By all appearances the opposite is true.

8403941,comment,8402229,8403386,0,0,crimsonalucard,,,"@benihana\n1. By running I mean like staying in Zone 3 for an hour or more. Or Zone 4/5 for a minute or two.<p>2. You call it discomfort, I call it pain, for effect, probably not appropriate but I hope you didn&#x27;t vote me down for this.<p>3. I&#x27;m not gonna argue about whether or not people enjoy pain (most don&#x27;t). Exercise in general involves a number of components that feel good and feel bad but the bad is significantly more explicit then the good. This is not a fact but its a generality that&#x27;s kind of evident when you see the obesity epidemic sweeping across 1st world countries. The majority of the population generally doesn&#x27;t like to exercise because it is painful and uncomfortable. I think most people can comprehend this statement and it is not a logical fallacy; It is an evident generality.<p>Sometimes I see people in runner circles talk about a thing called &quot;runners high&quot; like it&#x27;s cocaine, totally glossing over evident factors like why most normal won&#x27;t run 10 miles just to chase a fabled runner&#x27;s high. The logic here is obvious: the pain is not worth the high to most people.<p>I can&#x27;t be sure but I think what&#x27;s going on with those runners is what&#x27;s going on here in this thread, a sort of unconscious denial about an obvious generality. \n--\nIf weight training doesn&#x27;t involve any pain, then I can&#x27;t speak for it. I&#x27;m speaking for exercise in general which I believe I am correct.<p>4. Pain is usually not something that is enjoyed. If you do enjoy it it tends to be something that was learned. Like wine or beer. If that&#x27;s not the case for you, ok, but I think the general notion is that these things are an &quot;acquired taste&quot; aka &quot;learned,&quot; hence the presumption.<p>And yes I am telling people that they may not really be exercising. I see a lot of people quitting and doing things incorrectly with useless results.<p>5. Millions may exercise but Billions and billions of more people don&#x27;t exercise because it&#x27;s painful and uncomfortable. Are you telling me these groups of people cannot even comprehend one another? I think the average athlete has enough intelligence to comprehend why he is one of the few and why the majority of people on this earth don&#x27;t exercise. Anecdotal evidence on this thread is nothing compared to anecdotal evidence from the real world.",1412297626

Memorization is for efficiency: it clears the way for our brains to focus on higher-level thinking. The great Euler &quot;memorized not only the first 100 prime numbers but also all of their squares, their cubes, and their fourth, fifth, and sixth powers. While others are digging through tables or pulling out pencils and paper, Euler could simply recite from memory...&quot;.

How you decide you and your team act on these opportunities is where the value can be relative and vary per team.

1565148,comment,1564183,1564990,0,0,photon_off,,,"Amazingly, matching can be done with a single MySQL query that will take anywhere between .05 - 2.0 seconds (on average .25 if I do a whole batch of URLs) -- it depends on how popular the tags of the URL are.  Those numbers were too large for my liking, so I cooked up a Java program that loads the relevant db tables into memory and does the matching itself.  The program uses about 80MB (though it only 'really' uses 35MB -- damn Java heap) of memory and takes .008s to compute 500 matches for a given URL -- which I think is suitably fast.  However, its 8ms because I've optimized it quite well -- a brute force match would take URL_INDEX_SIZE^2 * 2 * log2(NUMBER_OF_TAGS_PER_URL) multiplications.<p>The main bottleneck is inserting those 500 rows into a separate table, which is currently taking .1 seconds.

The important thing to know is that the next byte cannot be definitively calculated - you can only calculate a possible value. The reason a lot of weak IV's is needed is so you can perform the same attack multiple times - at which point the correct byte value will appear much more often than any other value.<p>(incidentally; the theory behind it is actually pretty simple but you do have to be up on your encryption terminology for it to make sense on first reading :) when I learned all this from scratch it took me ages to get my head round it)",1280662345

Why can't I wire or ACH money to anyone else's account anywhere--why do I have to physically come into the branch, or pay for an expanded array of online business access services to do this?  Security concern?  Fine, use biometrics or something else clever to deal with it.  Why can't I deposit checks and cash 24/7 and have them credited to the account instantly?  Handwriting recognition?  Why are we still using <i>written</i> checks?<p>Admittedly, many of my problems in terms of limitations of online interfaces stem from using a small regional bank, which outsources different parts of its offering (business vs. personal online access) to different third-party vendors with disparate systems that don't communicate, and where most things (including transfers) can't be done outside normal 9-to-5 business hours.  I could probably solve some of these by banking with some of the bigger players, there is still room for improvement in ATMs.  The amount of overdraft & late fees I pay because I can't move money to the right account at the right time, as the owner of a very small business with a very high cash velocity and low transaction volume, is staggering.  It would be nice to be able to do most of the things I need to physically hoof my way to a branch for on an ATM, and I'm sure the banks would be delighted in reduced personnel costs too.",1280662035

We'd get out the list and make new estimates.  The schedule and cost would change based on those estimates.

However, it runs against basic psychology to fail to consider the enormity of the motivating force that is this kind of coercion throughout human history.  It has untold power.

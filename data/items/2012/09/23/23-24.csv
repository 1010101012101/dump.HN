4562587,comment,4561986,4562501,6,0,shimon_e,,,"The Chinese have a mob mentality. They themselves don't even know what they are rioting about, most the time. The internet is learning that it is about an accident in between a guard and a worker at 10pm. Trust me, the internet is learning this fact before a majority of the rioters are. If you can really call them rioters, as it is more like a 2000 man parade with about 5 people actually rioting (see the video). No one is in uniform so it is safe to assume these are off shift workers.<p>The last riot at Foxconn started with a dispute in between a worker and a local restaurant owner. Ended with a 1000 man riot. Nothing to do with Foxconn worker rights.<p>Such riots can't be equivocated with workers flighting for greater rights. They aren't. They want more money. Most the disputes are about broken promises of overtime work, as the workers make their best money from overtime. The workers don't live anywhere near the factories. They just work there for a few years to take money back to the villages where their families and friends live. They want money to improve families living conditions, not the factory that they don't give a damn about. They would trade factory conditions for more money almost any time, as the factory conditions are just temporary for them. They want to reach their goal of saving $X, go home, and enjoy their lives with their family and friends.<p>What I am saying is not universal in China. The Chinese government controls migration and in some locations factories can only employ local people. In such factories labour costs are much higher and workers do receive much better working conditions. This story is not about such a factory.",1348444628
4562586,comment,4561986,4562435,15,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Well the circumstances have remarkable similarities. Much of China's economic growth has been attributed to underpaid agricultural labor becoming better paid factory labor. (still underpaid but less so perhaps). That raises the amount of disposable income people have which raises their standard of living.<p>The next chapter in this book are unions (well that was the chapter that followed urban migration in many other countries) where the workers, demanding a fair wage for their work strike and stop production. This chapter can't start until there aren't enough underpaid agri-workers to fill the positions, but once there are, look out.<p>How all of that plays out in a totalitarian regime is not well understood at all. In the US and elsewhere the folks to took union organizers out behind a shed and shot them were eventually brought to justice and punished, enough so that the practice became too risky for the factories. It has been suggested that in highly corrupt or complicit governments that correcting force (justice for organizers against being shot) may prevent the formation of effective unions. And how <i>that</i> plays out on the world scene is even less well known since Europe and the US went through the union chapter when there wasn't instantaneous communication around the world.<p>Interesting times indeed.",1348444606

4562577,comment,4562211,4562211,18,0,crazygringo,,,"If you use a language that uses error codes, then you're forced to explicitly think about what to do in every single error case (or not, and accept the consequences). This can add a lot of mental overhead, but can result in a much more robust and well-thought-out program. But because more logic is involved period (to handle the robustness), the program is necessarily more complex.<p>If you use exception handling, then suddenly catching errors becomes much easier, and writing code is faster, but it's not like your program is any more robust. If you catch an error up at the top, your program or function is probably just going to quit. Of course, you can add more code to deal individually with each of the exceptions in more robust ways, even to the point of wrapping each statement in its own try/catch block, but then it's no different in practice from returning error codes.<p>In the end, I just don't see much of a practical difference. In both cases, if you want to be a lazy or rapid programmer, errors will lead to your software just not working. And if you want to be conscientious about your errors, then you can do that in both cases.<p>Exception handling lets you handle errors ""at a distance"". It's convenient, but harder to keep track of. Returning errors keeps your code execution where you can see it, and you always know where it is. It's simpler, but more verbose.",1348444410

4562571,comment,4562277,4562364,4,0,steerb,,,"This does really sound unusual. For me, the ratio of reading to writing is about 4:1. Are you sure you are not writing too much new code, because you didn't invest the time to properly understand the existing one?<p>When you mostly work with your own code, do you still have that feeling of constantly improving your coding style and code quality (like looking at code that is X months old and knowing you would write it differently today)?",1348444248
4562570,comment,4562211,4562498,5,0,0xABADC0DA,,,"It's actually worse than that.  The blog has error handling code like:<p><pre><code>    if err := datastore.Get(c, key, record); err != nil {\n        return &appError{err, ""Record not found"", 404}\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis is pretty typical Google Go error handling, where errors are only actually used as boolean flags.  Errors are universally returned as type 'error' so to actually do anything with the error you have to first cast it to some specific type.  But that type isn't part of the method signature so you have to dig around in the source or, if you are very lucky, it was documented someplace.  You end up having actual error handling plus even more error handling for if you got the error type wrong.<p>For instance if datastore could return 'record not found' or 'io error' then they would usually be treated the same way by the code because to do otherwise would be even that more of a hassle.",1348444228

Having worked primarily in Python for over 10 years (and generally been a huge enthusiast during that time), I'm pretty comfortable at this stage with the notion that exception handling languages contribute significantly in only one respect - they allow newbies to write code without ever properly understanding how errors should be managed without violating layering, where retries should be inserted, and so on.<p>The culture of writing code, and that code being fine once a unit test is passing seems to propagate the myth that it's fine for any code to throw any exception at any time  it doesn't matter as long as those errors <i>expected</i> to occur from testing are the only conditions that ever occur. As for the rest, well. Kaboom!<p>Starting off from C, it doesn't take you more than your first 100 lines before you discover pain due to missing a return value. In my experience, eventually 60% of your time is spent wondering how this particular return value propagates throughout the rest of the code you've written, and libraries in use.<p>The end result is my C code tends to be much more robust in the face of braindamage (say, network errors, IO errors) than my Python, simply as a result of a cultural mindset that basically encourages ignorance of error conditions.<p>You can also trace one of the biggest pains from Python 2 back to this culture: deferred error handling is at the very core of the Unicode/strings mess, probably the single most motivating factor for moving to Python 3.<p>[Extremely tired, aware this is poorly written and sways between points, but hope it makes some sense]",1348444188

From ABEND in the old IBM batch days, to uncatchable signals like SEGV in unix and uncaught exceptions in C++ or Java.<p>I tend to come down on the ""decide what you are going to do in the code, right where the error occurs"" flavor of the argument. So checking for errors when they occur is important to me, what to do next gets to be sticky.<p>So there are three things you want to do:<p>1) Easy - you just want to quit/die/exit pretend you never existed. This is pretty easy and most OS'es and embedded toolkits have something along the lines of 'exit' or 'exit_with_dump.' So that later you can try to reconstruct what happened.<p>2) Is ""this is bad, but it might be ok later"" where you want to unwind to the point where this started but not completely exit. Exceptions are pretty good for this if used well since you can catch them at the 'unwind' point and if you can attach the unwinding actions (closing files, freeing memory, etc) to the return stack then it can be managable.<p>3) You want to plod along in a degraded mode, which means you need some way of communicating with the rest of your code that you're damaged goods at some level.<p>Go has an interesting mix which I haven't used extensively but I wouldn't dismiss it out of hand.

Again, look at that GDP per capita chart I linked; the logarithmic growth of technology as measured by GDP per capita benefit has been both continual, and, importantly, very <i>steady</i>. It's surprisingly steady, all the way up to the end of the 20th century. To echo some of the articles that have been posted on HN recently, we are in a time of unprecedented growth and social change; but we always have been. It's not like something is magically different this time around just because the HN demographic is the one participating in it, and everyone is making smartphone apps instead of web 2.0 pages, or laying intercontinental fiber before that, and so on. Technological growth is gradual and smooth in aggregate, even if individual markets can be disrupted more noticeably, which is one of the prime reasons why the job market is able to keep unemployment as low as it has been for so long, and will continue to do so in the future.<p>The ""data set"" you're thinking of seems to be something along the lines of one data point being ""the industrial revolution happened, and long-term unemployment levels didn't rise."" But that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about how we know that technology has been increasing for hundreds of years, as measured by things like the GDP per capita chart I linked, something including hundreds and thousands of data points. That all comes down to a single check: despite hundreds of years of technological growth, which is growth just like we are experiencing now and will be in the future, is unemployment higher? No. Assembly lines were a paradigm shift, cars were a paradigm shift, the modern western office environment was a paradigm shift, computers were a paradigm shift, and the internet was a paradigm shift. The entire country was always unprepared in terms of skills to capitalize on those shifts, but the unemployment rate stayed low. Apparently, if people want and need jobs, jobs will come into existence. The law of supply and demand.<p>I really want to stress that there's nothing substantially different in terms of innovation currently, contrary to your argument. If nanotechnology makes physical manufacturing of products functionally costless, or if the singularity makes all decision-making and programming jobs irrelevant, then sure. But social media? Smartphones and tablets? Hardly. The skills required to do these things have existed for decades; the underlying technologies are very iterative, as technological progress usually is.<p>Technology levels can be measured in terms of GDP per capita, which can be followed back hundreds of years. Same with unemployment rates. But in the end, is the unemployment rate 50% or 75% right now because half of the workforce is simply unneeded or unskilled, or unable? No. Non-recessionary unemployment baselines are still around 5%.  To say that this particular, incremental paradigm shift that we're currently experiencing of increasing virtualization of our lives is any different is to be mistaken into thinking that our current era is a special snowflake apart from all the others before it; and that your judgement of technological change being too much for the job market to handle is different than that of Thomas Malthus's two centuries earlier, or all those thousands of voices in between.<p>I want to note that I'm very optimistic about the future of technology. I wouldn't be surprised to find that the human era will be over by the end of the century. But I also recognize that Malthusian-spectrum arguments never pan out, no matter how unique this current era is supposed to be in comparison to all the previous unprecedentedly unique eras.<p>edit: and can I add that I would be quite happy to see some technological change so rapid and sudden that it would put something like 5-10% of our workers out of a job pseudo-permanently. That would mean that some tremendous benefit to the economy has suddenly descended from the heavens of innovation. But those kinds of things just don't happen in eras like our own--unemployment shocks are instead currently temporary (usually being fixed in less than a decade) and due to very non-technology reasons, like the housing bubble and credit crunch this past decade.",1348442671

Those two categories are weighted equally on the survey - a teacher who gets 100% on the survey is good in both categories, a teacher who gets 0% is bad in both categories, and a teacher has more than one way to score 50%.<p>So, if both of those factors affect student performance on standardized tests, then there will be a strong correlation between the overall survey scores and the test scores. But analyzing the details of the survey results can offer actionable guidance that the test scores can't - the survey <i>does</i> provide useful information for how mediocre teachers can improve, even when it matches the test scores in predictive power for future test scores.",1348442333

The ""sordid worlds"" of popular entertainment? Thiel sounds likes just another rich guy losing all connection to reality and morphing into a know-it-all railing against popular tastes. What does he know? And all of this ""nature red in tooth and claw"" shit - ""most human beings through the millennia have existed in a naturally brutal, unchanging, and impoverished state"" - who is he to spit on thousands of generations of living, breathing people, and say their lives were shit? What gives him that right?<p>The other thing I find strange is his talk of a still-to-come ""energy revolution."" Thiel sounds like just another false prophet of growth. I'm pretty sure we already had an energy revolution - fossil fuels. Massive reservoirs of stored energy that we discovered, learnt how to extract, process, and utilise, leading to a bewildering array of techniques and technologies. Does it dissapoint Thiel that the fruits of these achievements have gone to relatively simple things - more homes, cars, appliances, holidays and health care for more people. Does it disappoint him too that population and desire expansion soak up our technological advances? We live in the most resource-intensive society in history - and apparently it's still not enough. We need to grow some more. It hasn't worked before, but next time, it'll be enough, for sure.<p>So what does Thiel want? Science to break the fundamental rules of physics? Science to break the fundamental principles of living species? Seems like Thiel is pretty uncomfortable with human eistence. He wants that 50s vision - clean, pristine, glowing, perfect, anxiety-free (a vision invented to sell vacuum cleaners to the most anxious generation in history, if I recall correctly.) Thiel is the classic modern: living in the most disease, conflict, death and accident-free society of all time, terrified of the physical realities of human existence, callously dismissive of 99% of all that humans have experienced on this planet, bitterly dismissive of the achievements of modern technology, blithely dismissive of popular tastes, wanting to have his cake (liberal human rights and the free market system) and eat it (techno-transcendence and mass adoption of his political views) too.<p>My advice to Thiel would be to decide exactly what it is that he wants (more fundamental physics research, better solar/wind/algae, more noble pop culture, authoritarian domination by a cultural elite, space resource extraction, better education, better sci-fi novels), figure out what's at the heart of his chosen problem and (just like a good hacker) go and come up with an innovative solution to transform the problem himself. Either research or advocate or fund or all three. But he should stop trying to preach like this on the failures of our civilization, because he is just talking out of his ass.",1348442263

But to my surprise, the data set somehow uses only <i>current</i> countries, even when giving data points for 1960 or 1970. It doesn't really explain how that happened, either. Did they somehow impute past data to current countries? What does the 1970 figure for Germany, or Serbia, actually mean? Something was too complex and didn't fit the database, so it got swept under the rug? Made my job writing this off-the-cuff blog post much easier, but now I'm left wondering what the data I used actually means, despite it coming from a highly respected source, and used in many academic papers.<p>edit: Found a paper describing the construction of the World Bank data. It looks like they use what they describe as an admittedly crude method of attributing based on population shares, so e.g. immigrants to ""Yugoslavia"" are apportioned to Croatia/Serbia/etc. based on population share, assuming the immigration was uniform throughout. Not horrible as a first approximation, probably, though clearly not ""right"" either.

Focusing on price is fraught with peril and impossible to maintain for long.

Nailing the solution to a tough customer problem is a much better formula for sustained growth... not to mention higher margins.<p>The allusion to the whole product is a big deal, too, because this is how that value is perceived your customers.  Getting the core functionality right is a big piece of the puzzle, but I have often been amazed how much importance customers place on other things like a less painful sales process, service, support, training, etc.  Building a coherent package across several of these dimensions can be a great way to differentiate in a crowded market and avoid the slippery slope of discounts.",1348441940

I did background checks for years at a major company. Our clients were both big and miniscule - you'd be surprised at how many very small business would be able to afford a reasonably priced non-subscription background screening service. If the degree was off by some years, the client wouldn't hire the person because they lied on their resume. It doesn't matter what the lie is, just that they lied, end of story.<p>Don't lie on resumes. It's not HR that'll be catching them. It'll be a company that's been instructed to just report back to the client with whether things were true or not. And we caught a lot of both innocent mistakes (off by 1 year or so), as well as outright fabrications.<p>There's no trying to explain that stuff to HR when you're simply sent a rejection letter by a third-party.<p>Also, some of our clients were required by the government to account for where they've been for the past 5 or 10 years, and requiring paperwork proving where they were (even if unemployed) for any gaps in those employment. People were embarrassed to admit when they were unemployed and so left it unexplained... again costing them a job. Yes the paperwork explained to them beforehand they had to explain it.<p>And yes, we'd catch the ""small stuff"" - calling up a training school to verify someone had gone, and then double-checking government databases to verify the school itself was legitimate, running names and credit checks... and telling people ""we don't want to hear your explanation for why your resume is inconsistent. Send us paperwork proving it, and then we'll find out on our own if that paperwork is valid"" is all a liar would hear.<p>I do have to admit catching people in innocent mistakes was heartbreaking, and I'm glad I got out before they started offering the social network checking services.

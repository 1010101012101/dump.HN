No names or passwords were obtained, and no accounts were actually accessed.<p>Why is it important? If, as Orin Kerr claims, emails were public information, so were names and passwords, if stored under the same scheme. So if he accessed names and passwords, it would be also authorized access by the same logic. But it seems to me somehow Orin Kerr feels the weakness in this argument. Since he doesn't really expects people to believe that if you find a hole in a site that allows downloading account passwords via exploiting some vulnerability in HTTP server sending it some specially crafted data - he feels that it is necessary to emphasize that passwords weren't accessed. But many people consider their personal email no less private than their password - so if it wasn't OK to take the password (and by emphasizing that no passwords were taken Orin Kerr seems to implicitly admit it would be important if the passwords were taken) then it also wasn't OK to take the emails.<p>On the question of felony though he may have a point. Felony is a grave crime that renders the criminal second-class citizen long after the prison term has been served. I think for non-violent crime that did not result in actual grave harm it is too much, and while I remain unsympathetic to Auernheimer's person, I think if Orin Kerr succeeds in somehow reducing it to lesser grade (or cause a change in the law that leads to that) it would be great.",1363931184

This was not an epistle on sociological performances. This was a statement that ""X"" group ""CANNOT"" be racist.

I don't have the answer. (I know sha-256 is O(N) normally.)<p>As for bitcoin, though, I don't think there's too much to worry about. If a quantum algorithm grants a complexity speed up (or some sort of deal-breaking cryptographic weakness is discovered in sha-256 for that matter), I imagine the network could agree to update to a new protocol using a different hash, if that was the proper solution. If a quantum computer just gave integer-factor speedups such as ASICs are currently doing to GPUs and FPGAs, then I suspect by the time a quantum computer is made that can efficiently mine bitcoins, enough can be made at once that, just as we're seeing with ASICs, quite a lot of miners will grab them (avoiding a 51% issue) and the difficulty will simply rise.<p>Edit: <a href=""https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=78693.0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=78693.0</a> tells me <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm</a> would work, making the algorithm O(sqrt(N)) and effectively making the problem of finding a sha-256 hash into finding a sha-128 hash.",1363930828

It's taking sides in an issue where nobody looks good.<p>I don't have a problem with the joke being made.  I don't have a problem Richards being offended and reporting it to the convention staff, and, as a matter of fact, I applaud her decision to do something about it.  And PyCon's staff, from all reports, handled themselves very well in this situation.  Could the two guys in the photo been a little more sensitive to those around them?  Sure.  Could Richards have followed the advice she wrote in her own blog post and talked to the two men or alerted the staff privately?  Absolutely.  Would this entire clusterfuck have been avoided if one of those two things happened?  Yes.<p>But both of those things happened, and it spiraled out of control.  Because of one somewhat insensitive joke, and a really bad twitter post.  Everything that's happened after: the twitter posts, the blog posts, the firings, the harrasment, the DDOS', it all leaves a really bad taste in my mouth, and I don't see anything funny about this at all.<p>Because nobody involved here came out looking sympathetic.  Richards used her soapbox to publicly shame two men who really didn't deserve much more than maybe a simple talking to.  The two men who made the joke could have shown some restraint, but did not.  Both of the companies probably made the wrong decision to fire the two, though in Play Haven's case, there could be other things we don't know about, and Richards dragged in her company into the conversation probably without their approval.<p>Because it's been twisted into everyone's pet racism/sexism/ism trigger topic.  Bigots are using Adria's behavior as an example of why women can't be trusted.  People sensitive to issues of gender, sex, and race are using it as an example for why the entire industry's a cesspool of bigotry and sexism.

From my understanding of the law, which is limited I might add, this company has every right to fire her if she no longer fulfills her job requirements to the company's standards. She was at this conference representing her company. She is expected by her company to act with a certain level of professionalism. The public humiliation I spoke of took place during a time in which she was on the clock so to speak. This is where she went wrong. She represented her company in a very negative way by humiliating these men, quite tactlessly, in public. In this sense she was being quite hypocritical. She was acting just as unprofessional if not worse than the men making the jokes. I do believe that this is proper justification for firing an employee (as was observed when the man who made the joke was fired by his company.) The public humiliation I spoke of was not legal justification for her termination. It was the fact that she represented her company in an unprofessional manner that led to her being fired.<p>If she would have been mature and confronted these men, as grown ups should, this all could have been avoided. The only reason I say she was the aggressor is the simple fact that these men didn't even know they were offending her. They were in the wrong, most definitely, but that does not make it right for her to act unprofessionally as well.<p>As far as I can tell, this company's choice was legal and in their best interest.",1363928736

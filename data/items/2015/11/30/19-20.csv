10651375,comment,10644373,10648249,0,0,volaski,,,"Since you bring this up, let me tell you what really happens. You are right there is a burnout factor. In fact it does happen and I have grown to live with it. But the cool thing about burnout is it doesn&#x27;t last forever. If you have lots of ideas and you like to build things, chances are your motivation will come back soon enough. I personally think working passionately for a few months and taking a break for a week and going back and forth is much more productive than doing it half-assed and wondering how others &quot;find time&quot; to work on things. Also, this is a subjective thing, I&#x27;m giving my point of view based on how i think and you&#x27;re writing your advice based on how you think but neither of us are absolutely correct because every human being is different. Some people put higher priority in socializing and enjoying life&#x27;s other activities when it comes to living a life. Some people put higher priority in building something that they will be proud of. Most people belong to the former group and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s hard for them to find time to work on stuff. Sure you can live a well-balanced life like 90% of the population and live a normal life, or you can be different. Most people will think the latter group of people are heartless and idiotic, etc. but those people have highest ratio of success statistically. Lastly, I have been doing this for years and I am not &quot;totally turned off by programming&quot;. I do get burned out time to time but after a couple of weeks of taking a break i&#x27;m fully energized and back at it. Like I said, it&#x27;s just a difference in mindset. If you have something that you feel is meaningful enough to build, nothing else matters.",1448913556

Men want youthful, beautiful women whereas women want strong, resourceful men.<p>In enforcing monogamy, we ensured that male got what they wanted (a young woman) and now, that male can focus his attention on work. This worked well for women too (if they had a choice of male) since they now have a partner as well. Adultery was looked down upon to preserve the &quot;sanctity&quot; of this 1:1 relationship. This also kept men working hard to build the society (since they didn&#x27;t have to deal with family issues much) and women preserved morality and guarded home upbringing.<p>Today, since adultery/serial monogamy/polyandry/polygamy etc. is a joke and widely &quot;accepted&quot;, there is no incentive to get married. So many 18-35 waste their youthful lives just dating, dating, meeting jerks, partying, jumping from partner to partner....instead of focusing on building a REAL stable relationship.<p>By early 30s, most folks are sick of dating and all illusions of love are gone.<p>Monogamy is not practical without heavy penalties on non-monogamous relationships.",1448913488

10651317,comment,10646286,10651057,0,0,danharaj,,,"> increased genetic interest<p>This only makes sense if you think the individual is the primary site of selection pressure. It need not be. In fact, it probably isn&#x27;t. Genes compete and cooperate with each other across populations. An example of selection pressure that is supported beyond the interest of one individual&#x27;s reproductive success is the gay uncle hypothesis: Kin selection means that genes that favor a group&#x27;s reproduction while dooming an individual member&#x27;s chances can be successful.<p>In a social species like Homo Sapiens it is far too naive to examine fitness at the level of individuals. Our fitness is a function on ensembles of human beings, not just individuals. How the fitness of an individual and the groups they belong to are related is deep and fascinating.<p>Cooperation and collectivism are as much our essence as competition and individualism. There is no dichotomy between them. We are related to both Chimpanzees and Bonobos.<p>Anyway, this relates to your reasoning in this way: A group of human beings who freely procreate with each other and maximizing paternal uncertainty maximize their mutual interest. Such a reproductive strategy strongly selects for behaviors that maximize group cohesion and mutuality.<p>If we assume a reproductive strategy, the set of behaviors and their underlying genetics gain fitness relative to that reproductive strategy. A reproductive strategy that emphasizes the propagation of individual&#x27;s genes specifically works well with genes that favor individualistic behavior while a reproductive strategy that emphasizes the propagation of a coherent population&#x27;s genes works well with genes that favor collectivist behavior.<p>The converse implication holds as well. The population of human beings and the genes that are distributed amongst it are not driven by one master impulse, but instead ebb and flow according to external and purely human pressures. If a dictatorship arose tomorrow and instituted collective breeding, that would be quite a tumultuous change in pressures for individualism and against collectivism. Human nature is in a non-linear feedback loop.<p>Take a coherent set of behaviors and the genes that support them. Take another set that are at odds with those behaviors. You can ask how those evolve <i>as if they were competing as organisms</i>. There are no clean lines drawn in biology. Genes propagate and evolve, organisms propagate and evolve, populations of organisms propagate and evolve, ecosystems propagate and evolve, behaviors propagate and evolve.<p>So what I&#x27;m trying to say in a long-winded way is that your focus on individual interest is much too narrow and misses the forest for the trees.",1448913074

10651299,comment,10598176,10598448,0,0,sha90,,,"> I am far from being a Go expert but you can see this has been written by Java developers.<p>Hi! As of writing, I am currently the top code contributor to the AWS SDK for Go (NB: I&#x27;ve since moved out of Amazon). I&#x27;ve never written a day of professional Java in my life, but thank you for the compliment! Would you mind endorsing me for Java on my LinkedIn page? This will go far to getting me that enterprise Java job I never once dreamed of having!<p>But seriously, it&#x27;s worth noting that the SDK was originally created by Stripe, and most of what you&#x27;re likely referring to (struct inputs) worked in the exact same way when it was Stripe&#x27;s codebase. As far as I know, Stripe is also not a Java shop.<p>I&#x27;ve heard this exact same comment at the release of almost all of the AWS SDKs I&#x27;ve been around for, so I&#x27;m not too surprised to see it again. I think this comes from people incorrectly assuming that (a) most Amazon developers only use Java (this is far from true), (b) that complex APIs are inherently &quot;Java-like&quot;, and (c) auto-generated code is somehow evil, even though it yields fewer bugs, more consistent usage, better documentation, more performance optimizations (compare boto&#x27;s issue tracker to Ruby, for instance, and count the number of defects).<p>The reality is that sometimes complex APIs are just what they are: complex. Goamz is &quot;easier&quot; because in most cases it completely ignores the complexity of the full API by only exposing a small subset of it. For many use cases this is fine, but I&#x27;ve spoken to plenty-a-customer who told me stories of trying to hack in extra API calls to Goamz when it couldn&#x27;t do what they needed. That doesn&#x27;t sound &quot;easier&quot; to me.<p>Unfortunately, when you&#x27;re writing a generalized library meant to account for the simple and complex use cases alike, you can&#x27;t optimize only for the users who touch a small portion of the API&#x27;s surface area. You have to start with a base that supports all use cases. If AWS had released a library like Goamz, you would hear the other set of users complaining just as loudly that they can&#x27;t do X with the SDK, talking about how poorly designed it is for them. Over time, you may see the Go SDK add specialized APIs to make certain simple use cases easier (just like has already been done in other SDKs), but this won&#x27;t happen right away-- it requires a lot of effort to identify and prioritize those cases. The S3 upload/download managers and the DynamoDB marshaler abstractions are a good example of this. Instead of yelling into the wind, I would recommend opening issues to ask for similar simplified APIs for use cases that are genuinely complex with the current SDK. But note: they should be <i>genuinely</i> complex, not just &quot;this takes 4 lines of code and it should only take 2&quot;.<p>> The usage is so verbose and you need to pass pointers around all the time. Even when it&#x27;s clearly not changing the original instance (when passing by value would be enough)<p>Passing by value is not enough. Go cannot differentiate a string value of &quot;&quot; (or int value of 0) from one that was omitted by the user, which is why we (very painfully) had to make the decision to use pointers. Making this decision sucked; we literally spent weeks trying to whiteboard workarounds that wouldn&#x27;t completely gut the core functionality of the SDK. Unfortunately, @lobster_johnson said it best when he pointed out that Go forced our hand here. The lack of overloading, named parameters, default arguments, nil-by-value, really are the reasons why it&#x27;s just not possible to make this more elegant in Go. Using positional args, as pointed out, wouldn&#x27;t even last 2 months before you would see breaking changes in the API calls for many of the AWS services. Things really do change that fast in the APIs, it&#x27;s the underlying reason why all of the AWS SDKs moved to auto-generated code. It&#x27;s the reason you now all get SDK updates on the day of the API release-- with way fewer bugs along the way. That&#x27;s a good thing.<p>I think the team did a great job getting this out given the circumstances. Go is a solid language for app development, but it&#x27;s not really optimized for generalized libraries. The lack of common language features (literally, the lack of &quot;generics&quot; for generalized interfaces) means you&#x27;re effectively writing code with one hand tied behind your back. With a foreign keyboard layout of your evil coworker&#x27;s choosing.",1448912880

What happens when society moves towards polyandry?<p>Polyandry had particular high logistical costs for most of our history, because of childbirth. However, birth control technology has developed to the point where such arrangements are now practical. My current girlfriend and various women I knew in college have reported to me encounter frequencies of 3X per day during their 20&#x27;s, along with their male partners at the time basically complaining of that rate being &quot;unsustainable.&quot; It may well be possible for certain women to be able to sustain polyandrous relationships, and for them to benefit from such relationships while acting as a moderating force in society. (The &quot;Attila&quot; stories by Antonio Sequra and Jose Ortiz have a character who engages in this arrangement in a post apocalyptic world. In the stories, the polyandrous arrangement also serves as a small military force, highly motivated to protect its leader. These stories are probably NSFW, so no links posted here.)<p>Oddly enough, a there is a very &quot;easy&quot; legal/social framework for allowing the establishment for what is effectively a &quot;loosely bound&quot; polyandry: legalized prostitution. Of course, &quot;easy&quot; is in quotes, because, while the legal framework would be very straightforward, the political and cultural barriers to passing the enabling legislation are huge. Also, only a subset of the activity enabled by such legislation could be fairly called a &quot;loosely bound polyandry.&quot;<p>EDIT: If we note the prevalent pattern of human behavior, humans are pretty much &quot;serially monogamous&quot; -- where our attentions are mostly, but not exclusively, given to one particular partner at a time. However, the state of nature seems to indicate a pattern of having secondary and tertiary partners or transitory dalliances as well. Given the availability of effective birth control and mechanisms for preventing the spread of sexually transmitted disease, we are probably overdue for a reshaping of societal norms to better fit the actual historical behavior of &quot;monogamous&quot; people.<p>EDIT: I was informed that polyandry was practiced, so was possible before modern birth control.",1448912786

This is the part I don&#x27;t remember but it&#x27;s something like &quot;find the longest segment on your route, is there some shorter way to accomplish what that accomplishes? no there isn&#x27;t. or look at the shortest segments, are they penny-wise but pound-foolish, no they aren&#x27;t.&quot; i.e. the part I do remember is that it is polynomial time to confirm the answer, and it is not polynomial time to find the answer.

I&#x27;ll just quote the abstract to entice people into reading it:<p>&quot;The anthropological record indicates that approximately 85 per cent of human societies have permitted\nmen to have more than one wife (polygynous marriage), and both empirical and\nevolutionary considerations suggest that large absolute differences in wealth should favour more polygynous\nmarriages. Yet, monogamous marriage has spread across Europe, and more recently across the\nglobe, even as absolute wealth differences have expanded. Here, we develop and explore the hypothesis\nthat the norms and institutions that compose the modern package of monogamous marriage have been\nfavoured by cultural evolution because of their group-beneficial effects—promoting success in\ninter-group competition. In suppressing intrasexual competition and reducing the size of the pool of\nunmarried men, normative monogamy reduces crime rates, including rape, murder, assault, robbery\nand fraud, as well as decreasing personal abuses. By assuaging the competition for younger brides, normative\nmonogamy decreases (i) the spousal age gap, (ii) fertility, and (iii) gender inequality. By shifting\nmale efforts from seeking wives to paternal investment, normative monogamy increases savings, child\ninvestment and economic productivity. By increasing the relatedness within households, normative\nmonogamy reduces intra-household conflict, leading to lower rates of child neglect, abuse, accidental\ndeath and homicide. These predictions are tested using converging lines of evidence from across the\nhuman sciences.&quot;",1448912212

It&#x27;s one of the few things about PHP that you see in both lists of advantages and drawbacks haha.<p>&quot;As far as your points 1, 4, 6, and 7 are concerned - it&#x27;s pretty much on par with other dynamic languages such as Lua or Ruby.&quot;<p>I believe it for 1, 4, and 7 but am skeptical on 6: internal quality and security. The few times I saw people dedicate time to PHP vulnerabilities were finding them 10+ at a time. Lua and Go <i>should</i> do better due to simplicity but I haven&#x27;t verified that. Coverity reported Python having lowest defect rate of about anything at one point. Getting updates on scoring like that vs other dynamic and static languages might be a useful metric. Compared to most web stuff, I&#x27;ll leave 6 at maybe.<p>&quot;Rubyists tend to talk about how speed is not important, which I disagree with, and PHP has never let me down in this regard.&quot;<p>They&#x27;re foolish if so. Definitely a speed advantage for PHP given work (esp Facebook&#x27;s) put into that.<p>&quot;Personally, I think PHP is strongest in fact without using the class system religiously, and instead making major use of its array/list type and functional code patterns.&quot;<p>I believe that. It was true for some other languages before. So, that solves 2 but 3 is still on table. Languages supporting strong static analysis, design-by-contract, advanced typing, and so on can do better than a PHP-like language. This includes dynamic ones extended with that stuff. So, 3 is a maybe leaning towards no if against application rather than scripting languages.<p>&quot; PHP&#x27;s unique strength and primary reason for me using it is its execution model in a web server environment. Every other language and web framework has gone the way of the application server, but PHP is using a per-request execution model which is incredibly powerful if used right.&quot;<p>&quot;In exchange for this you get to benefit from a stateless app. If your code, the interpreter, or a library screws up, you&#x27;re not taking down the server with it, you just disrupt the requests that actually hit the bug.&quot;<p>Definitely makes things easier to understand and reduces issues. Certainly an advantage against anything not supporting such a model where it&#x27;s needed. Adds support on 5 given stateless reliability is easier to boost.<p>&quot; there are lots of things this is unsuitable for, especially when you really do need a persistent app server. &quot;<p>That&#x27;s a lot of modern web apps, though, right? I can&#x27;t guess at the percentage but &quot;LAMP stack&quot; implies databases and persistence are the norm.<p>&quot; it can be advantageous to write a small broker-style server in C or Node (or Go, or Erlang, whatever you want), and put the intelligence part in a PHP backend API.&quot;<p>Smart idea. I can see the potential gains. There&#x27;s parallels in highly assured systems where we kernelize critical functionality, implement it robustly, and untrusted stuff just calls it often with interface checks. It&#x27;s a proven method with lots of application. Do you have any resources on doing this right in web applications out of curiosity? Just in case I have to get back into that.<p>Conclusion<p>We started with 7 metrics. Your case showed it&#x27;s roughly comparable to competition in 4/7, probably better on 1/7, a maybe on 1/7, and a stronger maybe (stateless) on 1/7. Rather than horrible, with these metrics it comes out as OK in most ways with advantages in some and potential disadvantages in just a few. So, baring new data or metrics, it&#x27;s objectively Ok at this point compared to others with possible advantages in speed or error minimization at component level. I say possible because I&#x27;ve seen competitors do similar things. I&#x27;d do case by case comparisons there but PHP is overall OK based on your data.",1448911340

This information should cause one to be a bit skeptical about the sort of &quot;sleep hacks&quot; that come up often on HN.<p>The test for narcolepsy I took consists for lying in bed the morning-after of the overnight part of the sleep test, and falling asleep 4 times. If you can fall asleep 4 times, and if you go too quickly into REM sleep every single time, then you are a narcoleptic. Narcoleptics can fall asleep very easily and tend to go very quickly into REM, but they do not go very easily into the deepest stage of sleep, which is the stage <i>the brain uses to rid itself of certain materials.</i> So narcoleptics have a bit of a problem. Often, we can get what many would call a &quot;decent&quot; span of sleep. However, we may only spend a couple of minutes in the deepest stage of sleep, where we might really want more.<p>I own a Zeo sleep monitor, and the data that I got out of it corroborated what the sleep studies indicated: I get only a fraction as much of the deepest stage of sleep, compared to the average for my age.<p>So here&#x27;s the problem: These &quot;sleep hacks&quot; that allow you to enter into REM sleep very quickly for &quot;power naps&quot; may be harmful to you in the long term.

Further, unlike a lot of countries, the US has significant spare taxing capability (it rests in the middle tier globally on taxation). The US could easily raise $200 billion in new annual income taxes on the top 25% and not miss a beat - that single move alone would handle any potential issues from the public debt cost. Or better yet: the US can constrain its spending growth (as it has been), allowing income and assets to continue to outrun the problem.<p>And of course the US owns the global reserve currency, which enables it to export inflation to the rest of the world as a means to reduce the domestic hit of things like QE (which is why the Eurozone&#x27;s QE hasn&#x27;t been as effective). When the US uses the dollar to improve its fiscal circumstances, the rest of the world foots a big part of the bill.

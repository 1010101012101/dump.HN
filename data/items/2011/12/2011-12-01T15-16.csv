These results seem to be backed up by pitdesi's post.<p>Since HN is so centered on startups, that's quite a few founders and potential entrepreneurs who could be working on the next Google. And all things being equal, there is a 2/3 chance that that next Google won't be happening in the US.<p>The Valley is amazing, but it's nothing without talent. Making our immigration law more amenable to founders obviously won't cause a mass migration of founders here, but surely some will be attracted to our awesome startup hubs. And we need every edge we can get.<p>We really need a startup visa.<p>---<p>Edit: A couple of the responses have misinterpreted what I was hoping to convey. Of course I don't think everyone is dying to come to the US. What I am simply arguing is that 1) HN is a decent proxy of the startup community, 2) much of that community is outside of the US, 3) is there anything the US can do to attract <i>some</i> of that talent?<p>This is a question <i>every</i> country should be asking themselves, because startups are engines of prosperity. 
For the US, I think the startup visa is a good solution.",1322755159

Robert E. Hall & Susan E. Woodward, 2010. ""The Burden of the Nondiversifiable Risk of Entrepreneurship,"" American Economic Review, American Economic Association, vol. 100(3), pages 1163-94, June.<p>Abstract: Entrepreneurship is risky. We study the risk facing a well-documented and important class of entrepreneurs, those backed by venture capital. Using a dynamic program, we calculate the certainty-equivalent of the differences between the cash rewards that entrepreneurs actually received over the past 20 years and the cash that entrepreneurs would have received from a risk-free salaried job. The payoff to a venture-backed entrepreneur comprises a below-market salary and a share of the equity value of the company when it goes public or is acquired. We find that the typical venture-backed entrepreneur received an average of $5.8 million in exit cash. Almost three-quarters of entrepreneurs receive nothing at exit and a few receive over a billion dollars. Because of the extreme dispersion of payoffs, an entrepreneur with a coecient of relative risk aversion of two places a certainty-equivalent value only slightly greater than zero on the distribution of outcomes she faces at the time of her company's launch.",1322755015

As a richly multi-paradigm language Scala is complex enough as it is, but the various warts and leaky abstractions it inherits as a citizen of the JVM make it that much more perplexing.<p>Perhaps the idea that Java programmers would find it an easy first step into functional programming was incorrect, and in fact those bold enough in the first place to dip their toes into FP would prefer a cleaner and less compromised view of FP as provided by Haskell, OCaml etc?",1322755009

I've even prepared a FAQ on this issue, especially for HN polls, and here it is again for anyone who didn't see it last time.<p>VOLUNTARY RESPONSE POLLS<p>As I commented previously when we had a poll on the ages of HNers, the data can't be relied on to make an inference about the age distribution of HN participants, and similarly here we can't make a valid inference about the geographical distribution of HN participants. That's because the data are not from a random sample of the relevant population. One professor of statistics, who is a co-author of a highly regarded AP statistics textbook, has tried to popularize the phrase that ""voluntary response data are worthless"" to go along with the phrase ""correlation does not imply causation."" Other statistics teachers are gradually picking up this phrase.<p>-----Original Message----- From: Paul Velleman [SMTPfv2@cornell.edu] Sent: Wednesday, January 14, 1998 5:10 PM To: apstat-l@etc.bc.ca; Kim Robinson Cc: mmbalach@mtu.edu Subject: Re: qualtiative study<p>Sorry Kim, but it just aint so. Voluntary response data are worthless. One excellent example is the books by Shere Hite. She collected many responses from biased lists with voluntary response and drew conclusions that are roundly contradicted by all responsible studies. She claimed to be doing only qualitative work, but what she got was just plain garbage. Another famous example is the Literary Digest ""poll"". All you learn from voluntary response is what is said by those who choose to respond. Unless the respondents are a substantially large fraction of the population, they are very likely to be a biased -- possibly a very biased -- subset. Anecdotes tell you nothing at all about the state of the world. They can't be ""used only as a description"" because they describe nothing but themselves.<p><a href=""http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=194473&tstart=36420"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=194473&tsta...</a><p>For more on the distinction between statistics and mathematics, see<p><a href=""http://statland.org/MAAFIXED.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://statland.org/MAAFIXED.PDF</a><p>and<p><a href=""http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz</a><p>I think Professor Velleman promotes ""Voluntary response data are worthless"" as a slogan for the same reason an earlier generation of statisticians taught their students the slogan ""correlation does not imply causation."" That's because common human cognitive errors run strongly in one direction on each issue, so the slogan has take the cognitive error head-on. Of course, a distinct pattern in voluntary responses tells us SOMETHING (maybe about what kind of people come forward to respond), just as a correlation tells us SOMETHING (maybe about a lurking variable correlated with both things we observe), but it doesn't tell us enough to warrant a firm conclusion about facts of the world. The Literary Digest poll<p><a href=""http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5168/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5168/</a><p><a href=""http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/data/LiteraryDigest.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/data/LiteraryDigest.pdf</a><p>is a spectacular historical example of a voluntary response poll with a HUGE sample size and high response rate that didn't give a correct picture of reality at all.<p>When I have brought up this issue before, some other HNers have replied that there are some statistical tools for correcting for response-bias effects, IF one can obtain a simple random sample of the population of interest and evaluate what kinds of people respond. But we can't do that here on HN.<p>Another reply I frequently see when I bring up this issue is that the public relies on voluntary response data all the time to make conclusions about reality. To that I refer careful readers to what Professor Velleman is quoted as saying above (the general public often believes statements that are baloney) and to what Google's director of research, Peter Norvig, says about research conducted with better data,<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>that even good data (and Norvig would not generally characterize voluntary response data as good data) can lead to wrong conclusions if there isn't careful thinking behind a study design. Again, human beings have strong predilections to believe certain kinds of wrong data and wrong conclusions. We are not neutral evaluators of data and conclusions, but have predispositions (cognitive illusions) that lead to making mistakes without careful training and thought.<p>Another frequently seen reply is that sometimes a ""convenience sample"" (this is a common term among statisticians for a sample that can't be counted on to be a random sample) of a population offers just that, convenience, and should not be rejected on that basis alone. But the most thoughtful version of that frequent reply I previously saw here on HN did correctly point out that if we know from the get-go that the sample was not done statistically correctly, then even if we are confident (enough) that HN participants are young (in the case of polls on age) and American (in the case of polls on location), we wouldn't want to extrapolate from that to conclude that the users of any technology site are young, or that start-up founders in general are American.<p>On my part, I wildly guess that most HNers are residents in the English-speaking developed world, because the concerns of Hacker News are concerns of people living in developed countries and the language of discussion here is English. Moreover, Hacker News was founded by people in the United States. So it wouldn't be any surprise if a plurality of participants on Hacker News live in the United States, and a majority live in countries where English is a routine language learned in secondary education. But we can't conclude anything from this poll, whether it is on the HN front page for one hour, one day, or one week, about what the overall distribution is on HN of participants residing in ""United States - NYC and SF area"" as contrasted with ""Australia/Oceania,"" or any other bin the data are sorted into, because the data are voluntary response data and are useless for modeling reality.",1322752598

Correct me if I am wrong.<p>I was about to say the same thing (though comparing it to Mungwall and Enforcer on AmigaOS), but then I read through it in more detail. There are significant differences:<p>Electric Fence/Mungwall/Enforcer type systems rely on one or both of poisoning and using the MMU to trap accesses. But the MMU approach only works fast if you only trap access to unallocated <i>pages</i>, not if you try to trap every access. That's where the comparison to Valgrind comes in - Valgrind checks every memory access precisely. But it's ridiculously slow.<p>So you get immediate feedback for accesses to unallocated <i>pages</i> from the simpler tools, and very quickly, since it's no slower than any other memory access through the MMU, except when there's a hit. Tools like this may or may not try to be more precise by trapping accesses to partially allocated pages, but if they do, performance drops dramatically.<p>Then they can trap <i>writes</i> to poisoned areas where they don't trap reads by running checks for magic values at specific times - typically at least on free() and program exit. The problem with this is that it won't pinpoint <i>where</i> the write happened, and it won't catch reads of unallocated memory.<p>But this tool inlines code during compilation that checks every dereferencing of every pointer, as far as I understand, by maintaining a lookup table that says whether or not a specific <i>byte</i> is allocated or not. The upside is that they can be as precise as Valgrind.",1322752381

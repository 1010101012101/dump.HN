Instead most research likely shifted into more subtile forms of psychological manipulation, both on an individual level using cult indoctrination techniques and on a mass scale using disinformation and media manipulation. When they say MKULTRA was a failure and was abandoned, they&#x27;re probably telling a half-truth.<p>The speculations about the Peoples&#x27; Temple at the end of this article aren&#x27;t particularly crazy at all. There&#x27;s no proof so they&#x27;re only speculations, but there&#x27;s enough circumstantially there to give them a certain amount of credibility as worthy of investigation (if we had a press with a pulse). I&#x27;ve suspected for many years that the rash of weird cults that descended on the scene in the early 70s might have been, in at least a few cases, laboratories for the continuation of group mind control experiments. The Peoples&#x27; Temple may have been an experiment to see just how far you can take a willing group of &quot;volunteers,&quot; and in the end it went so far... possibly threatening to escape control... that the entire group needed to be disposed of.<p>I also see the recent Facebook study on crowd manipulation as being evidence that these techniques are likely trickling into the private sector, as technologies usually do. The Facebook study showed only a very tiny effect, but Facebook is a medium permitting only limited interaction with the subject. You could probably gain significantly better results if you controlled or could influence much wider swaths of the media, as intelligence agencies can.<p>Unfortunately the conspiracy theory tag keeps anyone serious from looking into it, and the field is full of obvious nonsense about space aliens working with the CIA to mind control alien abductees on behalf of the global new world order chemtrail conspiracy or whatever the latest du jour is. Could all that stuff be disinformation designed to render the entire subject beyond serious inquiry? Naaah.",1405954782

Cheap, ubiquitous, safe and surprisingly highly regulated for safety and fares.<p>If you&#x27;ve never been to Korea, one thing that pops out immediately is the uniformly very high level of service quality nearly everywhere as compared to the U.S. or Europe. You can already order just about anything you can imagine to be personally delivered just about anywhere you are for next to nothing.<p>Taxis there are similar and the prices are so low it&#x27;s a wonder that the drivers can even feed themselves. The fares barely seem to cover the cost of fuel.<p>I&#x27;ve never had a taxi show up late when I called for one, and there are so many you can usually hail one almost on demand. The taxis are always clean, unlike NYC. More importantly, the number of stories I&#x27;ve heard of drunk people leaving purses or phones behind, and having them returned the next day, is remarkable.<p>Sure you get the occasional surly driver, and language can be a problem, but that&#x27;s anywhere, even with Uber drivers. And for $10-15 a ride across most of the city, Uber isn&#x27;t pushing down anybody&#x27;s prices.<p>If there&#x27;s one place that can revolutionize their own taxi service and offer on-demand pickup via apps, it&#x27;s going to be Seoul.<p>Uber&#x27;s statement about Seoul is garbage. If there&#x27;s an example of a modern, efficient, &quot;smart&quot; city, anywhere on the planet, it&#x27;s there. Compared to London and D.C. at least, transport in Seoul is one of the best planned utopian paradises you can imagine and it gets remarkably better every year.

The rate is regulated so you know what it will be <i>before</i> you flag down the taxi, and the regulated meter gives you assurances that you&#x27;re not being cheated.<p>This bit of regulation becomes obsolete with an Uber model: if you request an Uber ride with the app, you know you&#x27;ll be paying Uber prices (and you can even get an estimate in the app IIRC).  There is no need to regulate the price because consumers are empowered to do informed comparison shopping prior to the hail.<p>Regulations should not be imposed on a business who has made the rationale for that regulation obsolete.

Several tiers of service, bullet taxis, company taxis, self-owned, deluxe.<p>For some tiers, drivers have to have 5-10 years of accident free driving - in Seoul that&#x27;s remarkable.<p>Here&#x27;s an example fare: $2.50 to pickup and go 2km, about $.70 a km after. Gangnam to Gyeongbokgung palace (across most of the city and over a major river) will run you about $15.<p>A trip from Brooklyn to Harlem, about the same distance and complexity, is likely to run $30-40.

Ingestion of multiple magnets, or ingestion of one magnet and a metal component attracted to magnets, poses a unique health hazard (6,7). Although these magnets generally are small enough to pass through the digestive tract, they can attach to each other across intestinal walls, causing obstructions and perforations. Initial signs and symptoms of injury are nonspecific, leading to delayed diagnosis and greater injury. Even when caregivers know a child has swallowed magnets, they might assume that such small pieces will pass normally. On radiologic examination, a health-care provider cannot ascertain whether objects swallowed are magnetic and whether they are in separate sections of the gastrointestinal tract with tissue between them. To aid with diagnosis, a compass might be passed close to the abdomen to determine whether an unidentified object in the bowel is magnetic.§ Once magnetically attached across bowel walls, magnets are unlikely to disengage spontaneously.<p>> Building sets and other toys containing magnets pose a substantial hazard to children who commonly mouth objects. Manufacturers of any consumer product containing magnets should take precautions to keep the magnets in their intended positions within plastic pieces and should consider making larger plastic pieces to minimize the likelihood of ingestion. Similar injuries have resulted from ingestion of magnetic beads, jewelry, and homeopathic aids (8,9).<p>> Caregivers should keep products with magnets out of environments where children aged <6 years are playing and be aware of the unique risks if ingested. Magnets should never be used to emulate tongue or lip piercing. If caregivers suspect a child has ingested a magnet, they should seek health care promptly. Caregivers also should be aware that children might be reticent to admit ingestion or unable to describe what they have ingested. Delays in diagnosis and treatment can lead to serious or fatal outcomes.",1405953585

Uber/Lyft act as car dispatchers without any of the power or responsibility of traditional taxi/limo companies.

The current Wikipedia article on de Grey is largely written by de Grey and his close friends, and the article there about his approach to anti-aging research is written mostly by fans of his research. Wikipedia is currently a biased source. But I have been going to the complete journal subscriptions of a large research university with a medical school, with updating Wikipedia in mind. The general approach advocated by de Grey (and pursued by other researchers) is interesting, and was worth looking at when it was first mentioned, but it is not panning out as a general approach to reduce risk of aging-related health problems. I think the billionaire mentioned in the article kindly submitted here, who lived into his nineties, knew more on a practical level about how not to age too soon than de Grey does. (Aubrey de Grey has no medical training, after all.)",1405951845

An Uber spokesman in Seoul denied that the service was illegal as Uber is “a technology company that connects drivers with passengers” and doesn’t directly run a taxi service with rented cars.</i><p>Anyone know where we can get this statement? Taken out of context (which is most likely was), this reads like Uber is just a bunch of whiney rich kids and makes me like Uber less. I presume they would write something that talks about the economics of Uber for a city like Seoul. For example, saying Seoul can leverage existing technology (drive costs down) and increase economics (more people in the city and more jobs for drivers).",1405951795

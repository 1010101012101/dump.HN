I left for NYC for five days. Since I develop sensitive cryptography software, I do not store anything sensitive on my desktop, only on my laptop, which is kept with me at all times (even when going on dates and such.)

Personally I took as many AP courses as I could get my hands on, but the two versions of an AP class seemed to be really slow pace and really high percentage busywork.<p>By the time my senior year hit, for example, I was attending just enough of my AP Calc class to stay in it and when I was there I slept. AP Calc was my favorite course in HS (because of the math, not nap time), but between the lack of content and slow pace, I couldn't stay awake. I always got points off for not showing work on tests, etc, because I did the work in my head and the time it took to write everything out wasn't worth the ~2 points it cost me.<p>My college experience wasn't much better. These days I assume it's because I spent the extra four years in HS. I had academic and athletic scholarships, but the classes were ridiculous and of the same HS variety. Sometimes I wonder if applying to places like Stanford would have helped the situation, but when I see the course setups I'm not so sure.<p>I'd agree that college is more self-directed than HS, but I don't believe it's self directed enough.",1360454256

When a content consumer isn't prepared to pay more for your content than the attention required to consume it, the market rate for that content is - by definition - zero.<p>Because so much content is created, and the barriers to creating it are so low, the imbalance of supply and demand is so great that the vast majority of content has a market value of zero.<p>Unfortunately the content creators, used to a time of limited content supply and therefore an ability to make good money for that content, have not adjusted to this reality.  There isn't likely to be an adjustment that lets them continue things as they were.<p>What concerns me is the willingness of the major content publishers to throw their lot in with totalitarian governments in pushing solutions which enable censorship and remove control people have over their own devices.

What we see is that even after only 3 months of YC when the founders are all working as hard as each other under stress and often the idea bears no resemblance to the original idea, that this starts to become a problem.  The founder with less stock starts to feel like this is not such a good deal for him / her and it can lead to problems.<p>There are other reasons for uneven stock and as you mention, different levels of commitment or unequal status levels cause problems too.

    order being generated in advance of the date and time for delivery such that
    the order has a period of time of pendency prior to the delivery;

    creating, by the computer system, one or more order items for the order
    based on a last delivery date and the frequency of delivery of each
    list item in the recurring delivery list;

    receiving at the computer system a change made to a first list item of the
    recurring delivery list during the period of time of pendency of the order;

    in response to receiving the change, determining, by the computer system,
    whether the order includes an order item corresponding to the first list item;

Also, until he is of legal age, he may have to do as he is told by his parents. Look at the state laws. Look at homeschooling laws. Look at the possibility of attending college part time. Getting him enrolled in college part time may go over better with the parents and the school system/general bureaucracy while freeing up time for him to sleep and run his business.<p>Since he is clearly intelligent and strong willed, I think the best role you can serve is as a mediator between him and the system/powers that be. Our laws generally are not designed to account for someone so young and so competent. Most adults will think he cannot possibly know what is in his own best interest and, legally, he has little right to decide for himself. Btdt, got the t-shirt.  I managed to advocate for myself anyway, but it was via a form of emotional blackmail since, as a legal minor, I had no legal right to look out for my own interests. Emotional blackmail is probably not the best route to go for a budding entrepreneur. Dealmaking is a better path forward if he can get any cooperation.<p>You could also search for laws regarding emancipation of a minor. When I was 14, California passed laws allowing for emancipation at age 15. This means essentially claiming adult status early for purposes of signing rental agreements and other contracts. However, it is probably reserved for cases of abuse. Given his age, I wonder whose name is actually listed as legal owner of a lot of the business assets. Most businesses will not sign a contract with a minor because they legally cannot be held to it. If his parents signed for everything, he needs to keep them on his side. Until he is 18, there is a legal and practical limit to how much he can tell the adults around him to go screw themselves. (In cases of abuse, you can stretch that limit because ending up on the street may be an acceptable alternative. But that hardly seems to apply to this situation.)<p>If he were 18, that would be a completely different situation. But he is not. So legally he likely has no right to just do as he pleases. So if you wish to help him, you probably need to help him find a reasonable compromise which is palatable to all parties. If he really wants to be an entrepreneur, this negotiation process (in which he legally has no real say) will be an excellent advanced course in dealmaking. If he views it that way, perhaps he can view it as a challenge to relish instead of just a bunch of pointless obstacles from idiot adults. If you haven't already, you should both read ""getting to yes"" and ""the heart and mind of the negotiator"".",1360452817

Fill out your entire profile<p>I know it sounds boring but if your profile is half full, youre only getting half the results. Heres why.<p>People search for other people on LinkedIn. When they look for experts in their network, they type keywords into the search bar.<p>This is your sales profile. Its a website for your personal brand. Its what most likely shows up when people google your name. Make it good. Get endorsements, upload videos, attach publications, collect recommendations from customers. Make your profile 98% perfect.<p>2. Get ranked in the LinkedIn search engine  its so easy.<p>Just by targeting one specific keyword or phrase with the text in your profile, you can show up more often in search results. Use it in all major parts of your profile including the tagline, summary, work experience, expertise, and interests.<p>Your keyword or phrase should be related to your role in business. For example, mine is association marketing.<p>The more times you use the keyword, the higher you rank in its search results. Its like the primitive days of google. Theres no lengthy indexing process  when you add keywords to your profile youll see the results immediately.<p>3. Write a clear headline<p>You want people to know who you are immediately. Make sure your title is clear by including these 3 things:<p>What you do, who you do it for, and how you do it.<p>Example: Marketing specialist helping associations and startups increase engagement through strategic programs and online solutions<p>Get a birds eye view of your network with LinkedIn maps.<p>4. Post to groups<p>Leverage your entire network to spread your messages.<p>Share a link on your profile page. Then, click share under the post and select the share to groups option. Sharing to group allows you to post in front of thousands of people at once  dramatically increasing your reach.<p>5. Connect with everyone<p>I know LinkedIn treats you like you should know people before you connect with them, but seriously? Expand your network by connecting with anyone who wants to connect. Those people are all potential relationships  partners, customers, suppliers, and future sales.<p>6. Connect with the best through the new skills section<p>LinkedIns new Skills & Expertise section (under the more tab) allows you to see which skills are increasing in demand. When people search specific skills they find the best people, companies, and groups related to that skill. Following and studying these skill-leaders is your first step to becoming one yourself.<p>See how the new LinkedIn Skills and Expertise section works.<p>7. Start building relationships softly by engaging<p>Use LinkedIn to softly begin and solidify relationships. Go and like peoples posts, congratulate them on new job titles, and endorse them for their talents. Whatever you do, dont try to make hard sales pitches on LinkedIn. It never works. Be nice to people  engage with their content. Social media is about being likable so dont shout your name in the middle of a metaphorically crowded room.<p>8. Create your own group<p>Grow your network big time by creating your own group. Did you know that you can export an entire email list from a group you own? Thats right any member of your group can go straight into your email marketing campaigns.<p>When you create a group, create it around a topic  not your company. The group is all about content marketing not pushy sales so cultivate a healthy group culture by posting valuable content yourself.<p>9. Export your contacts to an email list<p>If you havent exported your connections and added them to your email list go do it! If you havent started an email list we have another discussion coming.<p>10. Use your url on everything<p>Always expand your network. Put your LinkedIn url on your business card, email signature, website bio, and any other place imaginable.<p>After every new contact you meet via email, or face-to-face meetings, follow up with them on LinkedIn. Even consider making it your goal to make one new connection every day.",1360451934

A lot of the open data released has been things that will benefit entities other than political campaign groups.<p>Consider data on train positions in the UK. It's been locked up in various ways for a long time, or at least with restrictions that amount to non-commercial usage. So what you ask? Providing a live train-times service from the data costs money: I've been told it's upwards of 500 messages/second and there's a lot of problems you have to work around.<p>Releasing the data behind it is starting to help people to find cheaper tickets, make a more truthful record of train punctuality than official figures, etc. Many companies will benefit financially from this (rather than the current monopoly) but <i>the public will benefit</i>.<p>There are cases where accountability is at least starting to be possible. Last year I helped a newspaper look at published NHS data for things buried under the carpet - think hospitals that are failing to treat certain age groups for conditions like Diabetes. That's accountability. The UK pupil database is similarly promising.<p>Things need to get better but it's not as bad everywhere as the author claims of Canada or the USA.",1360450988

If he just went to a community college and got an Associate Degree in something, the difference between having a ""real"" HS diploma and having a GED vanishes in the wash.

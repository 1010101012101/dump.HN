Reserving some external bandwidth as wired-only is a pretty crude way to accomplish the latter.<p>Any time you have a bandwidth sharing issue, the first step should be to rate-limit the router to just below the modem&#x27;s speed (thereby preventing the modem&#x27;s bufferbloat from kicking in) and apply an advanced qdisc to your router&#x27;s WAN interface (preferably fq_codel if your software is new enough). That will keep latency from going sky-high when the WAN connection gets saturated, and ensure fair mixing of competing flows.<p>Only if that is insufficient should you move on to more barbaric strategies like overtly singling out certain clients or protocols for special treatment, since those policies are high-maintenance and often prevent the second-class citizens from getting full performance even when the network is otherwise idle.",1421103337

It&#x27;s most always a mistake. The more they pile on the more he revels in it.<p>Having said that, I&#x27;m fine with him continuing to opine. The dangerous thing I&#x27;m seeing is politicians who don&#x27;t seem to be responsible for anything: everything they do is based on experts somewhere who are more than willing to back them up on whatever decision they make. The real discussion we should be having here is the role of academia and the role of elected leaders in a democracy. That&#x27;s where the lines are blurring, and that&#x27;s the reason you see well-meaning (but perhaps not-so-well-educated) folks protesting who can work the job of basically &quot;a guy that tells me things I didn&#x27;t know&quot;. It&#x27;s because they view professors as some sort of priesthood that decides what the policy should be. That&#x27;s not true -- and it should never be true.",1421102883

If mainstream economics is so demonstrably flawed, the best way to make the point is not to childishly disrupt conventions and speeches, nor to make personally-directed attacks at individuals. The best way to &quot;protest&quot; the flaws would be to consistently and professionally refute the flaws and falsehoods.<p>By making their vehicle a protest rather than a rigorous intellectual deconstruction, at best the message is that they can&#x27;t come up with more than catchy slogans and loaded (unbacked) statements. I have not done significant research beyond the article linked, which includes no reference to supporting and more rigorous arguments produced by this group.<p>Factually, there is huge variation in the economics profession and the claim &quot;Neoclassicism is essentially the standard for 95 percent of the graduate departments in the country.&quot; is simply not true. There are many academic foci in economics and a healthy dialogue among proponents of different viewpoints. There is also a vast network of blogs published by both academic economists and amateurs (connotation = non-professional, but well educated on the topic) treating the topic in a more casual tone.<p>Lastly, the representation of neoclassical economics presented is a straw man, and an uninspired one at that:<p>>the fantasy world of neoclassical economics — a faith-based religion of perfect markets, enlightened consumers and infinite growth that shapes the fates of billions.<p>This is the model (excepting infinite growth) typically taught in introductory economics courses of all types. It is not taught as an actual representation of the world (though even as simplified as the models in Intro Micro/Macro carry a great amount of explanatory value over a naive interpretation of matters economic), but as a framework within which the basic principles of economics can be taught.

Neo-classical economics says that the <i>price</i> of a good or service is a function of supply and demand.

What&#x27;s the &quot;value&quot; of your receptionist? Well how do you measure that? Simple: get rid of her, and have your developers answer the phones. The decrease in productivity from that is the value of her position, and it&#x27;s independent of how many or few people could do the job. The <i>price</i> of her services is a lot lower, and based on the cost of hiring someone else to do the same thing. There&#x27;s a strong drive in our society to conflate the two, but they&#x27;re mathematically distinct.

Yes, but that doesn&#x27;t make it wrong.<p>Rant: the older I get, the more I think that &quot;value&quot; (our social evaluation of worth) should be based on nothing more than hours of labor.

Well, in most programming really, but in kernel programming unmanaged complexity leads to lost data and sometimes broken hardware instead of &quot;just&quot; crashes.<p>Case-sensitivity is the easiest thing - you take a bytestring from userspace, you search for it exactly in the filesystem. Difficult to get wrong.<p>Case-insensitivity for ASCII is slightly more complex - thanks to the clever people who designed ASCII, you can convert lower-case to upper-case by clearing a single bit. You don&#x27;t want to <i>always</i> clear that bit, or else you&#x27;d get weirdness like &quot;`&quot; being the lowercase form of &quot;@&quot;, so there&#x27;s a couple of corner-cases to check.<p>Case-sensitivity for Unicode is a giant mud-ball by comparison. There&#x27;s no simple bit flip to apply, just a 66KB table of mappings[1] you have to hard-code. And that&#x27;s not all! Changing the case of a Unicode string can change its length (ß -> SS), sometimes lower -> upper -> lower is not a round-trip conversion (ß -> SS -> ss), and some case-folding rules depend on locale (In Turkish, uppercase LATIN SMALL LETTER I is LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE, not LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I like it is in ASCII). Oh, and since Unicode requires that LATIN SMALL LETTER E + COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT should be treated the same way as LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE, you also need to bring in the Unicode normalisation tables too. And keep them up-to-date with each new release of Unicode.<p>So the last thing a kernel developer wants is Unicode support in a filesystem.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/CaseFolding.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/CaseFolding.txt</a>",1421101997

8876831,comment,8876429,8876429,0,0,jacques_foccart,,,"Another foreigner discovers the wonders of Francafrique, but he gets the mechanism wrong.<p>Although trying to study the place from third party sources is like watching Rashomon, this is pretty much how it works:\n- &quot;friendly&quot; dictator is installed and maintained so long as he cooperates. \n- aid packages are sent over (in cash, by plane) and loans made with friendly zero interest\n- money flies straight back via Geneva to finance French parties (e.g. RPR and Chirac, but also Mitterrand whose network was a subset of Pasqua&#x27;s, ironically; who knows who is in charge these days)\n- country is maintained in poverty by any means practical (rigged election equipment with magical 90%+ wins, flying in 1,000 soldiers into Congo from Chad, shipping weapons by the crate...) so as to lower the cost of keeping it under control. This includes financing both sides of a war (as in Angola), and the &quot;black governors&quot; as some call them deliberately installing the rule of corruption from top to bottom (see Mobutu for the best example). The loans and missing aid definitely help keep the finances problematic, especially when they cause future resource production to be promised away for years as collateral.<p>It&#x27;s important to note that Francafrique has been internationalised; FX Verschave, who despite being almost a communist has been very good at keeping track of the whole thing thinks the French networks have become subsets of the US ones. Cuba, Russia were also big players on the chessboard. As for the targets the saying is the louder they complain about the West, the closer they are. Omar Bongo was hand-chosen by De Gaulle (cf Foccart&#x27;s memoirs) and trained and educated in France. He was the most reliable and famous, so close to the French government he arbitrated disputes between ministers.<p>You basically hear two sides of the story:\n- &quot;communists are trying to take over the place and we must stop them and forget human rights for a while whilst we do so&quot; (CIA, Rhodesians, South Africans back in the days)\n- &quot;the Western capitalist powers will do anything to conquer their colonies and keep them in control, but we&#x27;re the democratic choice&quot; (Madagascar, Ghana, Zimbabwe and the aforementioned left wing countries). Some of the claims are pretty bold, for example aforementioned Verschave claims the left wing Mitterrand made Le Pen&#x27;s political career happen (from 0.4 to 10% of the vote) in exchange for maintaining a nice vivier of far-right youth that could be relied on for African &quot;holidays&quot; and the occasional false flag car burning in Algerian-French banlieues.<p>I don&#x27;t think either side is right of course but you can glimpse crumbs of truth from each side, and occasionally pockets of data emerge as the various powers take the fight to the press and public temporarily, or some Don Quixote decides to try her hand at windmills like Eva Joly against Elf (cf &quot;Poisoned Wells&quot; which is a nice taster to the place). I look forward to reading the declassified intelligence documents in 70 years or whatever it is. Mercenary accounts can be pretty entertaining too - I&#x27;ll close with Simon Mann&#x27;s quote about the French DGSE and military intelligence, &quot;whatever you do, we can do dirtier&quot;.",1421101506

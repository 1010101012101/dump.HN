355589,comment,354764,355529,0,0,markessien,,,"I don't. I really dislike people who think that reading is in some way something special or unusual. People who think that reading is all about literature. That's like saying movies are all about French Films with 15 minute stretches of silence.<p>There are many types of books, and there are many types of reading. Books are just like talking, but written down. Talking does not fit neatly into your 3 categories. When Jay Leno does a monologue, do you criticize him for not imparting ancient wisdoms? No. But people have nothing against criticizing a writer of popular sci-fi for not doing the same.<p>Crichton was not a bad writer at all. In his genre, he was excellent. His purpose was never to create some long lasting work, it was simply to entertain. And succeed he did.<p>Books are not some mystical source of magical knowledge like so many pseudo-intellectuals seem to think. It's just someone telling you something, but in a written form. You may not like what a person says, but if millions like it, then he is doing it well.<p>Of course, I can make this argument as long as I want, but I'll never be able to make these people understand that having Dostoevsky on your bookshelf does not mean you understood it. When you read it and then all you get from it is the same as what one could get from Wikipedia, then you have failed in your attempt to access literature that is not for you to understand.<p>Some of the most ridiculous dialog I have observed is usually between two people talking about books that are noted in popular culture as being intellectual. What most readers can do is talk about the books, but they don't understand what the guy who wrote the words was trying to tell them. They see the surface, they analyse the tricks, but the fail to understand the meaning. Ridiculous!<p>It's often those same people who will criticize ""lesser"" books and ""popular"" authors. I really dislike this pseudo-intellectualism.<p>One has to achieve humility in interacting with other minds.",1225972651

In fact, can we just give the FTA and Homeland Security positions to Schneier for a few months to let him write sensible rules for security?  He already has most of the rational documented.<p>I do not like the idea of a CIO under-secretary, or whatever.  A CIO trying to pull together ""cost-saving"" across government agencies would be a bureaucratic nightmare.  Best to have gov agencies start to operate more agile on their own.<p>As a side note, Kleiner's flying a Turkish flag on his new sailing toy may raise awareness about how the rich offshore money and avoid taxes (yes, I do understand how high luxury yacht taxes are and that this is standard practice).  Doerr may want to be careful about not attracting too much attention to his friends that make most their income on capital gains ;).",1225969415
355561,comment,355478,355535,0,0,boris,,,"I try to do things that I enjoy. Something that I would do (or would like to do) even if it didn't have any monetary payoff. If you can find a project that you would do, rather than read the net, and it happens to pay the bills then here is your journey.<p>This is, of course, quite a bit simplified. In any non-trivial venture there will be a significant number of things that need to be done and that you don't particularly enjoy doing. But if the greater part is fun then it is easier to sometimes buckle down and get through the mundane parts.<p>I guess it also largely depends on the personality. I, for example, hate having to do something quickly, without fully understanding the area, and moving on. On the other hand, if I have a chance to spend time and get exhaustive knowledge about something then I genuinely enjoy working on it even if on the outset it seemed unattractive (think sales, marketing, writing, etc., vs hacking some interesting piece of software).",1225969229

To borrow a weak metaphor: reading a lot of criticisms and interpretations is like having someone lift the barbell while you&#x27;re on the bench.  Sure, you might tax your arms a little bit but you&#x27;re not actually working out.<p><i>Why limit knowledge to people who have $50,000/year to blow on college? Not everyone is rich and upper class. Can only people from well off families become &quot;properly&quot; educated? ... To me, at least, intelligence and a drive to learn are far greater indicators of someone&#x27;s likely degree of sophistication than how much their parents spent on their four year vacation to some over priced campus.</i><p>This is completely irrelevant to the point I made, and it appears you&#x27;re just trying to rail against the college system as a whole.  Which is cool, I guess.<p><i>I&#x27;ve seen too many english and other writing intensive liberal arts majors graduate without knowing the difference between your and you&#x27;re, its and it&#x27;s, to really have any respect for the degree.

I suspect this is because they already mastered it in high school, if not earlier, much like myself.</i><p>I don&#x27;t want to disparage your anecdotal evidence, but I -- and imagine many, many others -- have had the exact opposite experience.  The average literacy and communication ability of a STEM graduate is far below that of a humanities grad.

5933697,comment,5932055,5933177,1,0,oleganza,,,"Lets see.<p>As we both probably agree, the nominal money supply does not matter. E.g. there is no functional difference between 1 million dollars in total supply and 1 billion. All prices are nominally higher in the latter case, but the relative distribution of wealth is the same. (In other words, rename &quot;1000 dollars&quot; into &quot;1 shmollar&quot; and you&#x27;ll get the same prices in 1bln economy as in 1mln economy.)<p>Since all that matters is relative distribution, when anyone increases money supply, it matters to whom it will go. If your central bank prints new dollars and distributes them to everyone in proportion to their existing holdings, relative distribution does not change. Prices will rise, but wealth will not move.<p>If, however, the central bank prints new money and gives only to some people, they will have higher purchasing power comparing to anyone who did not get the new money. The money is being shifted towards those who are closer to central bank, so their economical decisions get more power. Example: today we both have $1 and compete equally for 1 apple. Tomorrow I get extra $1, so I can outbid you for 1 apple at a price $1,15 per apple. You didn&#x27;t get the best apple and I still have $0,85 to outbid you elsewhere on the market. So my new money raises prices for <i>both</i> of us, but I have <i>more</i> of it, so I&#x27;m more frequently outbidding you and buying what you cannot buy anymore.<p>If this game is voluntary (e.g. if we voluntarily use gold as money and some people dig it from the ground on regular basis), I have no problem with it. If suddenly someone discovers an infinite gold mine and starts affecting everyone&#x27;s wealth, I may choose to use something more stable as money. Or may stick to gold if its utility is still better than the price of inflation.<p>However, if the game is not voluntary, then we have a huge conflict of interests. If everyone in the country is OBLIGED (directly with legal tender laws and taxation in USD, and indirectly via various currency controls) to significant extent to store and transact money in centrally-controlled currency (e.g. USD), then those who control money supply get huge power. They can reallocate resources wherever they please in a nice hidden manner. And users of the money cannot invalidate the scheme by switching to other money because of the aforementioned laws. And laws (by definition) are legal threats  against disobedience. So if you don&#x27;t like that your wealth is being diluted towards certain persons (e.g. generals and soldiers in Iraq), the only way to really confront this is to avoid using USD. But it&#x27;s not that easy because of tons of guns pointed at various levels at many different people in the whole economy. If you even try to do something money-related, you&#x27;ll be attacked pretty quickly on &quot;money laundering&quot; and &quot;helping terrorists&quot; grounds. Just look at what problems Bitcoin exchanges face and how banks are self-censoring by preemptively shutting down exchanges&#x27; accounts to avoid regulatory intervention and losing their license.<p>See also how the gold was confiscated by the feds in 1933 to avoid repeating the myth that &quot;we switched from gold voluntarily to superior USD&quot;: <a href=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6okepMAnHdc/TZrXaHL7ymI/AAAAAAAAAeA/zzsogGaAxbU/s1600/executive_order_6102.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6okepMAnHdc/TZrXaHL7ymI/AAAAAAAAAe...</a><p>PS. On the &quot;long run&quot;: it never happens. It is a moving target, but never a destination. A lot of individuals during &quot;short runs&quot; define how the wealth is spent and where investment goes. If music-loving individuals print themselves some money, the whole economy will slightly shift towards their music preferences and you&#x27;ll have more music halls, concerts and sound studios than if they didn&#x27;t print that money or if people could blacklist that printed money, or switch to another money.",1372089254

It sounds like he thinks a law firm that adopts a better version of office is being a &quot;disruptive.&quot;  He says that if a business is constantly open to change, then what&#x27;s the point of disruption?  He confuses the role of adaptability and who the disruptor is displacing.<p>Think about the first word processor compared to a typewriter.  A company&#x27;s choice/ability to adopt the word processor didn&#x27;t make them a disruptive company.  However, the word processor creator entirely disrupted the typewriter company.<p>In the author&#x27;s article, he references Office 365.  Incorporating new features of 365 as they role out does not make the 365 customer more or less disruptive.  What&#x27;s disruptive is that 365 is attacking dropbox / google docs / other service providers.<p>In fact, when the author asks is the term &quot;disruption&quot; relevent if businesses become adaptable is kinda silly.  Adaptable businesses open up opportunities for more disruption.  If a business is willing to take on new ways of doing things then they are more likely to become customers of a new disruptive product or service, whereas old non adaptable businesses would limit the new product&#x27;s potential client base / make it harder to find first adopters.",1372088654

In that case,\njust move to a community rated\nstate, wait whatever waiting period\nif any, get medical insurance\nat the same rate as everyone else\nin that &#x27;community rated&#x27; state,\nand be fine.<p>Could argue that in part Obamacare is a\npath to &#x27;community rating&#x27; for\nall the states.  But some of the\nstates don&#x27;t want community rating --\nas far as I can tell, really only\nthe richest states want that.<p>My view, in brief, is that Obamacare\nwas not about healthcare.  Instead,\nObama wanted to play politics and, generally,\njust wanted a bigger Federal Government\nto have still more ability to play politics.\nNancy wanted a big case of &#x27;socialism&#x27; --\nNancy just dreams of socialism, \nin particular\nof Big Daddy Big Federal Government taking\ncare of everyone and making everything\n&#x27;all right&#x27;,\nespecially for\ninsecure, single women with\nsmall children.

Nancy\nwants a big, security blanket,\nsocialistic\ngovernment providing a \nbasic level of material\nsupport and quality of life\nfor everyone.<p>I could agree with Nancy except\nI fear that her hands on the\neconomy would make the economy\nso sick it couldn&#x27;t provide\nwhat she wants, that is,\nshe will choke the goose\nthat lays the golden eggs.\nIf Nancy could actually do a good\njob, then we have something\nto discuss; I just fear that\nNancy will make a mess,\na disaster.

For a portable solution there are a number of way of storing the hierarchy so that it&#x27;s efficient to select a specific subtree.<p>One way I&#x27;ve done it before is to have a field that contains the path (eg node1/sub_n/sub_n2 etc) and another field containing the ordering (in my case I did it across the whole tree). You can then use simple single selects to get ancestors / descendants / subtrees / siblings / all sorts of things you need (eg where path like &#x27;/path/to/subtree/%s&#x27;).

5933497,comment,5930640,5930736,1,0,BoredAstronaut,,,"I have a degree in English literature and criticism. I later followed it with a degree in applied computer science. I&#x27;m glad for both, and was disappointed in both, for multiple different reasons.<p>I think I understand why you would accuse the humanities of being &quot;rotten&quot;, but I&#x27;m not sure it captures my own experience of the malaise affecting college humanities departments (at least what I witnessed, with a somewhat jaundiced eye). I would say that the humanities is deeply conflicted about its purpose and relevance, and maybe even its approach and techniques. That there is little, if any, consensus on these questions. That there isn&#x27;t even any agreement on whether consensus is desirable, even a surface consensus for the benefit of students. That cynicism, confusion, uncertainty and fear are rife and toxic in the minds of faculty and administration. That this is in many ways a reflection of the mind of society at large, especially our leadership, actual or effective.<p>On the other hand, the purpose of technical training is less contentious, and it&#x27;s focus is generally not challenged much. There are questions about technique and content, and there is wide variance in teaching talent, but overall, most scientific disciplines have done a good job of building a reasonable syllabus based on foundational theory and mixed practise. We can feel confident after taking a scientific that we have acquired some amount of true knowledge and useful understanding.<p>But the exact opposite seems to be true of humanities, whether studied institutionally or privately. The same questions which have haunted us since the beginning of human history still haunt us today. These questions are all philosophical; the best, most honest answer to virtually all of them is, still, &quot;We don&#x27;t know.&quot; Throughout history, numerous people, including many undoubted geniuses, have suggested answers and made tremendous arguments. Today, many of those answers are still compelling, but, over time, their justifications have eroded under scrutiny. The more we look at human nature, and the more anecdotal evidence we collect, the more we fail to understand it.<p>That is the nature of art and letters: it is a vast and ever-growing accumulation of mostly anecdotal evidence which intelligent, talented and persuasive people throughout history have tried to use to validate their own opinions of the nature of human nature, life and existence. And most of it, no matter how beautifully presented, is all so much empty rhetoric, and completely unproven.<p>A programme in humanities, therefor, amounts to a lot of time and energy spent studying well-spoken (or otherwise well-illustrated), but failed attempts to provide insight into the core questions of philosophy. Many have embraced this uncertainty, but not answering a question is still a kind of answer. It never definitively proves that the question is invalid. And yet few seem willing to accept, and virtually none are satisfied with the truth: &quot;We don&#x27;t know.&quot;<p>As a result, the programme has degenerated into a cacophony. And yet, for the purposes of administrative coherence and the need to fulfill some sort of comprehensible structure, in order to reliably function in a standardized institutional setting, we still offer &quot;courses&quot; with focused areas of subject, and degrees made of such courses. Faculty members must continue to publish papers and/or creative works of their own. In all ways, schools must continue to behave as though they had some kind of coherent sense of their purpose and significance, despite a complete lack of any such belief in anyone&#x27;s mind. We continue to allow these so-called specialists to decide, on society&#x27;s (or at least education&#x27;s) behalf what it means to study, find value, and finally &quot;understand&quot;  these questions, or at least the techniques of, and approaches to, attempting to answer them.<p>So what we have is a sort of free-for-all disguised as a serious occupation, and a large body of highly paid specialists essentially run amok. No one knows what they are trying to accomplish, or what their level of success is or has been, so we just take them on their word that they are doing it, or that at least they are trying. With each passing year, the map of the territory continues to grow, but we are no better equipped to navigate through it. At least, it seems that the tools that educators and researchers might be using, from the social sciences, are not being used in ways which might help them, at least with any real scientific rigour. On the contrary, science continues to be misunderstood, misinterpreted and misapplied by humanities faculty, to the detriment of everyone (themselves, their students, and society and culture at large).<p>One of the most important features of the scientific programme is that of prioritizing knowledge based on our confidence in its truth and reliability. While historians of science may continue to study the failed efforts and discredited theories of the past, we do not, as a rule, teach these to practising scientists and engineers. They represent curiosities, or negative lessons in how to study science. The humanities either cannot, or will not, follow suit. The most important fight in the history of humanities was that over the &quot;canon&quot;, and it was a decisive loss for everyone. There is no accepted way to prioritize works. The yardstick of truth is not applicable. Beauty, subject matter, technique, form: all are matters of taste. And the simple and undeniable fact is that you cannot study taste. You can study matter and technique, and to some extent you can judge the difference between the attempt and the result, but even that has its detractors. When truth cannot be known, every opinion is valid, and no arguments are final.<p>Attempting to endure this nightmare of existential uncertainty is attractive to very few people. For those who enjoy art, and would like to spend their days discussing it, and especially those who like having an audience for their own opinions, for which they have a rather high regard, academia is an attractive option. No one can prove you wrong, but popularity can prove your right, at least for a time.<p>Interestingly, this isn&#x27;t that different from software start-ups, which are, more and more, about popularity and fashion than they are about inventing new things and the transforming the world.",1372087484

There the dream, Ted did\nlike the &quot;dream&quot;, was simple --\nsocialized medicine.<p>I suspect that &#x27;socialized medicine&#x27;\ncan be made to work well; maybe it does\nin Switzerland.  But I don&#x27;t trust\nthe results of the people who want &#x27;socialized medicine&#x27;\nin the US mostly just as I don&#x27;t trust\nthe people who just want socialism in the US.\nMy guess is that too soon we will be \npaying too much (yes, we are now, also)\nor screaming about bad medicine like\npeople do in the UK and Canada.<p>In a sense Medicare and Medicaid\nhave an advantage because they are mostly\njust payment mechanisms placed on top\nof what is roughly, very roughly, \na &#x27;free-enterprise&#x27; system.  But if just\nsocialize the whole thing, then \ncan end up with a bad version of the\nUSPS.<p>I&#x27;m not against the Federal Government\ndoing some things:  In places what the\nFederal Government does works out\ngreat -- Hoover Dam, Bonneville Dam,\nTVA, Los Alamos, NSF, NIH, DARPA,\nfunding of the top three dozen or so\nUS research universities, the Interstate\nhighway system, the FAA (the safety\nand engineering parts; some of the\nair traffic control parts), in the\nend most aspects of the USPS,\nthe Agriculture Extension Service of\nthe USDA, the FDA (pretty good on\nsafety, a bit slow on efficacy),\nand more.  For the VA, I don&#x27;t know:\nThere are complaints about the\naccess and quality, but I know no\ndetails.<p>So, for Obamacare, I&#x27;m\nconcerned that in the US\n&#x27;socialized medicine&#x27; is just super\ntough to get right and that the\nNancy, etc. efforts are not even\n10% as serious as needed.  Then,\nfrom the structure of the &#x27;board&#x27;\nor &#x27;panel&#x27; appointed by the president,\nI&#x27;m concerned that Obamacare\nwill become a\n&#x27;political football&#x27;\nthat results in low quality health\ncare at high prices.<p>&quot;Political\nfootbal&quot;?

E.g., in his 2008 interview\nat the SF Chron., Obama explained\nhis intention to raise carbon taxes\nenough to &quot;bankrupt&quot; our coal fired\nplants -- then 49% of our electric\nenergy and, as I recall, ~23% of all\nour energy.  I suspect he was just\nposturing, but it was dangerous.\nThen supposedly about $92 billion of\nthe various &#x27;stimulus&#x27; and TARP\n(I and II) funds went for &#x27;clean\nenergy&#x27; but turned out to be\nmake-work jobs and campaign\ncontribution kickbacks.  Supposedly\nsince then we&#x27;ve thrown another\n$45 billion at &#x27;clean energy&#x27; --\nto me, 99 44/100% about politics,\ne.g., campaign contribution kickbacks,\nand the rest water and not at all\nabout energy or the even the climate\n(in my view, there&#x27;s no very good\nevidence that the climate is at risk).<p>So, with US socialized medicine, \nI fear &#x27;waste, fraud, abuse&#x27; from a\npolitical football.<p>E.g., now we&#x27;ve got NSA:  Politics?\nSure:  No politician wants to get\nblamed for &quot;being soft on terrorism&quot;.\nSo, NSA suspends good judgment and\ngoes overboard -- &#x27;over reaches&#x27;, e.g.,\ndata on calls of 120 million or so\nVerizon customers, maybe all the\nUS e-mail traffic, maybe all the\nUS phone voice data.<p>E.g.?  Sure:  Snowden was a GED,\ncontract, bottom level employee in\nHawaii but apparently had his fingers\ndirectly on huge volumes of data,\nall at the NSA supposedly just \nterrific at &#x27;computer security&#x27;.\nWhy?  Poor oversight.  Poor\nexecution.  From the White House,\ndon&#x27;t give a sh!t about the details\nand otherwise a political football.<p>I fear the same for a US national\nhealth care system.  Yes, what\nwe have could be better, but it could\nalso be worse, and for having it\nworse Nancy is just the person to \nlead us there.<p>Maybe in an honest moment Nancy\nwould have said, &quot;We will just\npass it.  That&#x27;s all we can do.\nThen we will leave the details\nup to the execution of the Executive\nbranch, in some big office buildings\nsomewhere within 100 miles of the\nWashington Monument, and pass more\nbills if really necessary.  So, we\nwill just get it started and then\nlet others make it work well.&quot;\nBut they don&#x27;t have to make it\nwork well -- they might just make\na mess.  I&#x27;m thinking, re-engineer\nand rebuild a Boeing 747 in flight,\nwith people who just started learning\nabout sheet metal.",1372087409

There&#x27;s a lot of research being put into things to track where products are coming from & new standards in things like requests for proposals requiring suppliers to be socially & environmentally responsible.  Still, not every business participates in this practice.  Partially because of the cost & also because it&#x27;s hard to demonstrate this type of responsiblity to the consumer.  Oddly, there&#x27;s other companies like Red Lobster which buys 100% of its seafood from sustainable fisheries, but you&#x27;ll never see a single hint of this in their stores & advertising.<p>Relating to the concept above, I am working on an idea for a virtual complementary currency that is used to both finance socially responsible companies & steer money through supply chains etc. to other responsible companies.  That was a long winded explanation, but just think &quot;Bitcoin meets responsible investing.&quot;  Another way to imagine it would be to think about trading Certificates of Deposit when buying / selling goods instead of trading cash. The receiver gets something of value, but the fact that it&#x27;s in a CD means that they cannot break the investment you created without incurring a penalty.<p>The part that relates to supply chains / sweat shops is that to exchange the currency for its cash value there is a hefty exit fee.  This prevents companies you do business with from immediately liquidating the currency and ending the socially responsible investments you committed the currency to.  It also opens the opportunity to vary the exit fee depending on how responsible a company is.  Thus, you could leave something like an 8% exit fee (like an exit load on a mutual fund) on all businesses, including sweatshops in other countries.  But if you find a sweatshop that is treating employees better etc. you could reduce or eliminate the exit fee.  Doing this would cause the responsible sweatshops to value the currency more & make it more likely that businesses who accept the currency will seek out these suppliers in their supply chains. So I could go on, but basically the idea is to create entitlements (in the legal sense) through private contracts that cause the currency you spend to flow to more ethical businesses.<p>I&#x27;ve slowly started exposing my idea to friends to get more input and hoping to turn it into a company.  Most of my discussions have been on the investment side of the currency & not the Coasean approach to ethical supply chains.  Im also looking to do possibly do an independent study during my final semester of law school this fall that would look into all the legal aspects of securities/banking/financial regulation involving an alternate currency where the deposits finance socially responsible / clean energy companies.  There&#x27;s a ton of ways to do it, but each comes with a different set of legal burdens.<p>I&#x27;m also slowly starting to network through friends to find a possible co-founder for a company based on this idea with the hope of applying to Y-combinator this winter.  (I have dabbled w/ programming for fun, but haven&#x27;t built anything too complex.  I also realized that I mostly just liked learning the syntax & solving puzzles so my latest efforts have just been solving Project Euler stuff w/ Haskell for fun but with no intention of using the language in the real world).<p>For anyone wondering where the companies&#x27; profit would come from, it would come from exchanges on the system.  Unlike bitcoin&#x27;s P2P system, this would be a centrally managed currency.  This means that the payment systems would also be managed by the company.  They would take a small fee for each payment made with the currency system.  However, since all payments would have to happen through the company&#x27;s system, the company could charge a lower rate than square & other competitors (because the company gets to take a fee off of all future transactions instead of just the individual transaction & then passing the cash off to a private individual who is free to use whatever payment/banking system they want.)<p>Sorry if this was a a bit rambling / not too clear.

It&#x27;s actually pretty simple.<p>Take p=5. Then our &#x27;integers&#x27; in this ring are of the form a + b\*sqrt(-5) for integers a, b. Taking b = 0 we see that all the normal integers are part of this ring. So consider how 6 factorizes.<p>On the one hand we have 6 = 2  3... uncontroversial. But... due to the existence of new numbers in this expanded ring, we also get 6 = (1 + sqrt(-5))  (1 - sqrt(-5)) . These are evidently two different factorizations... it suffices to show that both are prime factorizations under the modified definition of &#x27;prime&#x27; we get when we allow factors of (a + b  sqrt(-5)). You can get there by noticing that any number of the form a + b  sqrt(-5) that factors into smaller such numbers must either be totally real (b=0), be totally imaginary (a=0), or have a larger absolute value than any number that could possibly multiply together with another number > 1 to get you 1 +/- sqrt(-5). This line of reasoning can show that 2, 3, (1 + sqrt(-5)), and (1 - sqrt(-5)) are all primes in this ring.",1372086487

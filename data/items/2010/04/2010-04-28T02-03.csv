Sure you can program but that's nothing compared to the complexity of mechanical engineering/microbiology/whatever.<p>You tend to be treated as necessary but undesirable. Someone that I, your engineer/doctor/professor boss who is far smarter than you, will have to waste time telling what to do. All so you can go do the fancy typing necessary to make the software do what I say.<p>In terms of respect level its not uncommon for non-programmers to lump programmers in with book keepers, compliance officers and other necessary but undesirable people.<p>It would probably be different if you were both a biologist/trader/chemical engineer AND a programmer.

Like all other things, there are good sides and bad sides.<p>Good things:<p>- Pre-vetted as you say, so there's some due diligence done.<p>- It's easier(in some aspects) if your partner belongs  to the same community(religion, sect, whatever)<p>- Longevity. In such cultures, marriage is held sacred, and people put up with lots of strain to keep the thread going. This is good for kids, if not for the individuals.<p>Bad things:<p>- Parental pressure: Though there's no compulsion, there's immense psychological pressure from  relatives/peers/friends.  In my culture, the girls bear the brunt, although the tide is slowly changing. It gets worse when your parents are financially or socially backwards.<p>- It's very difficult to find somebody aligned to your interests/tastes - essentially a lottery.<p>- You get very little time to socialize and understand each other. This is changing a bit, but still the socializing starts after you're engaged, which is basically pointless IMHO. The go/no-go decision is usually a snap decision. That sucks.<p>I'd write more, but hey this is hacker news..",1272423380

Its certainly one that has crossed my mind (only to be put aside due to the lack of time - maybe in a few weeks, after the semester ends...). This app leaves a bit to be desired, however. At least, judging by a quick look at the screenshots.. to name a few things that jumped out at me:<p>- Is that <i>Marker Felt</i> for the Y in the icon?!<p>- The use of modal views bothers me; it doesn't completely hide the splitview column, but, you can't select anything in it anymore as a result.<p>- The large emphasis on Instapaper makes it feel like the app is a glorified RSS reader meant to funnel you away from the app itself and consume the content elsewhere.<p>- When you <i>do</i> view a story in-app, its just a UIWebView that opens the HN page; nothing different than using Safari.<p>- Using a single line on the UILabel that has to be scrolled (instead of sizing it to fit, or just having multiple lines) seems like a hassle to find out the title of the story.<p>- Why does the full URL of the story matter? Regular HN does fine without it.<p>As an aside: Why aren't any of the HN iPhone/iPad/* platform apps open source? Seems like a no brainer to let anyone else submit patches. And from first hand experience, open source in the App Store <i>does</i> sell.",1272420885

""Don't wory"" should be ""Don't worry,"" there's no period in the first sentence of the small text, and there is an extra space before both exclamation points (I know that's a French thing to do, but it's not standard in English).<p>2. Don't use jpegs for this type of image, a PNG will be much more crisp. Right now there are clarity issues in the blue surrounding text.<p>3. If you use text in the HTML instead of using an image it will be much more friendly. The small text looks very odd on a Mac and in browsers that have good font rendering and anti-aliasing.<p>Good luck!",1272420712

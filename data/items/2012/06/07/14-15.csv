4079287,comment,4078483,4079026,19,0,JPKab,,,"It blows my mind that there are people on HN confusing opposition to the horrific practices that Monsanto uses with opposition to GM crops in general.  I am a supporter of GM strains of crops, because I think they have proven environmental benefits.  However, what Monsanto did to the seed cleaner is no different than blaming BitTorrent for piracy.  The only difference is that BitTorrent sites actually have a somewhat possible way to determine copyrighted works from open works.  \nThe seed cleaner is being sued simply because his services are utilized by people trying to cheat Monsanto as well as those who are simply seeking to continue growing their heirloom strains.  This isn't justice.  This is simply a huge corporation with vast legal resources doing whatever is necessary to prevent theft of their IP rights, even if that involves trampling people that committed no crimes.  It is cheaper for Monsanto to put every seed cleaner out of business than to go after the actual IP infringers.  But it is not really legal, and only holds up in court because the seed cleaners can't afford to fight Monstanto's legal shield, and too few judges bother to inform themselves on the topic.",1339081133

4079279,comment,4078483,4079201,3,0,peterwwillis,,,"This is reeeeeeeally missing the point. The conversation was about (apparently) the ethics of selling a product which is known to be used a majority of the time for the aim of killing a thing (whether that be deer or human, is up to the owner of the gun/bullet). This should not be a controversial statement.<p>Before someone says ""oh but you can use it for target shooting and/or sport!"", there is nothing about the function of a gun and bullet which suggests it is intended for (for example) target shooting, since you don't need something as incredibly powerful as your average gun or bullet to shoot a target. Not to mention the wide variety and increase of both power and rate of fire of different weapons... these things are designed for war, basically. An AK-47 is an incredibly reliable and impressive weapon, and unless you are the worst hunter in the entire world, would never need such a weapon for hunting. It's like a bow and arrow with a grenade on the end.<p>And let me go even further: bows and arrows are intended to kill things as well. It's harder to kill something with it, but that's what they were invented for, and that's what you're practicing for on the range. But I don't hear many people screaming about boycotting bow and arrow manufacturers/salespeople. The fact that it takes skill to kill with one killing instrument while a child can kill with another, does not take away from their intended purpose, nor the fact that the market for the thing is why they exist to begin with.",1339081079

This results in depression of prices and farmers have to compete on volume to make decent profits. Since normal seeds can't do that, all farmers are forced to use GM seeds. Once majority of farmers shift to GM seeds, farmers go back to earning the same profit while paying extra for monsanto. And more importantly, if they lose the crop for any reason (very common in India due to droughts/floods), they will go underwater and might even lose their land on which they take loans every year. This leads to suicides. This is exactly what happened with BT cotton which is one of the reasons why Indian govt blocked BT brinjal.",1339080958

This is precisely the reason why iPads, iPhones and Androids are probably going to eat into the gaming consoles market.<p>The biggest problem of PCs is the fast evolution of hardware.

More often, frameworks overlap in functionality and differ on matters of style and ideology. And this is what feeds the flame wars.<p>For starters, you have a choice between MyKitchen and spatula. MyKitchen has everything you need to make a reasonable pasta meal for up to 8 guests. The pasta practically serves itself... even when you are making steaks. spatula is totally dedicated to scraping things out of pots, and obviously you could just use MyKitchen.SpatulaFactory(_ctx) instead (you did read the equipment manifest, didn't you?) Plus MyKitchen has a plugin which will make pork buns that practically serve themselves... why waste time with low-level stuff like spatulas?<p>Some guy graduated from spaghetti to pizzas and he can only scoff at spatula, which is not necessary at all, since you can cook pizzas directly on the rack.<p>Another guy made this incredible pocket-sized leatherman which includes compact versions of all the kitchen tools including a camp stove.<p>It is true that most frameworks are better suited to some tasks than others, but for a given task one might be just plain technically inferior, or only different in some stylistic way.<p>Not that style doesn't matter, if it makes you feel happier doing your job. Otherwise, why bother with Ruby or Python when there is already Java EE or COBOL?",1339079156

I think that saying linux users pay more on average is somewhat misleading without some sort of analysis on the actual data. For example, if linux counts for only $100,000 of sales, and the average is $10 dollars a buy. Then you would assume 10000 buyers. However, one person putting in 10k (such as notch) would skew the results dramatically. Then you really have only 9001 buyers and the average price is $11.1 per a user, but that really isn't a good predictor of average price. Same thing with some windows users being really cheap. I think if you removed all people paying more than $100 for the bundle and all people paying less than $2 for the bundle you would find the average price to be much closer. Just my thoughts.",1339078172

After that, anything you Gimme gets put into your Dropbox folder right away. At least, that's how my Gimme Bar works.<p>I originally thought you had to had to go to Gimme Bar's website each time you wanted to back up, like you said, but recently (maybe a month ago?) files started being automatically put into my Dropbox folder as soon as I Gimme'd them. I'm not sure what happened, but I'm glad about the change.<p>So, tl;dr: Dropbox backup definitely works the way it should.<p>As for future-proofing, I think this Gimme Bar does a pretty good job. If Gimme Bar ceased to exist, you'd still have your library in your Dropbox folder. If Dropbox ceased to exist, your Dropbox folder would still be a folder on your computer, and your Gimme Bar library would still be there.<p>So, for you to completely lose your entire Gimme Bar library, all three of the following things would have to happen:<p>1. Dropbox would have to shut down,  \n2. Gimme Bar would have to shut down, and  \n3. The hard drive on every computer you had Dropbox installed on would have to fail, as would every back-up of every one of those drives.<p>If you wanted to go to Siracusian lengths, I guess you could install Dropbox's server client on a VPS.

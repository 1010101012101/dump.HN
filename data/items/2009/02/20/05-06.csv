I couldn't type on anyone's keyboard, everyone had their own key mappings, keyboard layouts, shortcuts etc.  Some had shorthand hostnames in their .ssh/config, non-standard terminal settings, crazy scripts in their .bashrc files, different virtual machines for different environments, etc.  I'd say it would be impossible to convince a developer that this is the only IDE they can/should use.",1235108764

488371,story,,,4,2,tokenadult,"Ask HN: What sites do you go to mostly to read the comments?",,"I see in the thread about Facebook competing with Disqus there is discussion about website discussion via comments. I LOVE to read the comments here on HN, so I can plainly see the value of comments from users on websites. And I read several online discussion forums (the one where I spend the most time is College Confidential), so like lots of user-contributed content when it is moderated, and good. But most news sites, and other information sites, I visit have comments that in my opinion REDUCE the value of reading the site, so I often skip the comments entirely. What sites do you visit, besides HN of course, where what draws you to the site is as much the comments from random users as it is the built-in content from the site operators?",1235108326

488365,comment,488035,488035,0,0,shiro,,,"I'm a freelance software consultant, which is my main source of income.  Besides that, I act.   I take auditions occasionally and lands to roles in local commercials, TV programs, independent films and reginoal theatres time to time.  I'm payed by acting, though it constitutes less than a few percent of my income (CMs generaly pay well, up to $1000/day; indie films and theatres mostly pro-bono or like $100 per production).<p>I'm by no means a professional actor; I'm non-union.   Acting is, objectively, my hobby.  In heart, I reluctant to call it a hobby, though.   I keep taking acting classes and hope someday I can land on some union gig.   It's not about money; consulting pays enough for living.   It's about great experience working with skilled actors and directors.<p>Oh, by the way, I'm almost 40.  I was deeply involved in theatres when I was in college.  Then I decided to concentrate on building engineering career, got PhD in EE and a programming job.  About 7 years ago I became independent, and soon after that I resumed acting.<p>Retrospectively, I think if I had pursued both acting and engineering simultaneously, I couldn't get the current flexible working condition.  When I got a job at a company making video games and CG movies, I imagined I could contribute to projects in a unique way because of my multiple interests.   Then I realized that, in order to contribute substantially, I had to excel in at least one field; there was no room for a person who had multiple skills but every one was half-assed.  In any field I think you have to have certain period concentrating in pursuing something to acquire skills at meaningful level.  It may or may not make money (money is largely determined by the balance of supply and demand), but money can be used as a litmus; if your skill is unique enough that people even pay to get <i>you</i> instad of someone, probably you are above par.<p>So I perspired in the software field.  I couldn't become world-reknowned developer or something but got enough reputation so that I could work independently.  Then I resumed acting.  It's slow, but I'm not in hurry; I'll be happy if I'm still acting in regional theatres and had a couple of small roles in films at 60.   If I had chased both acting and engineering, I suspect I'd be much more in haste and desperate.   Besides, the experience of working professionally in one field can be applied to another field; I know how I supposed to prepare, and I can see worth in my work itself separate from its monetary value.<p>Any skill takes large amount of time to master.  Probably the strategy is not to keep your passion, but to take several years to deeply dive into one thing at a time until the skill reaches certain level.  Then keep doing them in parallel for the rest of life.",1235107889

When set to a ""night"" setting it isn't creating an ""overcast"", it is merely changing the color temperature of the monitor to something more in line with moonlight (4100K) or lamp (3400K) light sources, something you could do manually by adjusting your monitor settings.",1235107874

488357,story,,,27,10,patio11,"Ask HN: Quick wins for your business?",,"I thought, hey, since there are a bunch of smart people here, we might be able to share some little minor practices or projects we found were effective.  Sure, most things are business specific, but I'm betting we can all benefit a lot from some generally applicable tips.<p>My contribution:<p>I used to spend an unhealthy amount of time doing metrics navelgazing -- go to Google Analytics, go to payment processor logs, go to email, etc.  A good deal of it was just a nervous habit -- wonder how many sales I made today, wonder whether this month will be better than last month, etc.  And it always turned out to be the same four or five metrics.<p>So I build myself a dashboard on my site, which used APIs and data I already had, and put all those metrics on /private/dashboard, behind a HTTP basic password prompt.  This took me an hour and has saved me dozens.  Every time I find myself doing repetitive processes (looking up customer keys, etc), that process gets added to the sidebar on the dashboard.<p>Thus its one click access to a quick business health-check and two clicks to get to essentially anything I do more than once a month.  The ROI on time is impressive -- now instead of spending 5 minutes logging into my payment processor, clicking ""access transaction log"", and typing in parameters to answer the question ""What are sales like this month as compared to last month?"", its something I can catch out of the corner of my eye as I do productive work.",1235107662

What you see while editing is exactly what you get in the output. Some clever programming made this possible.  But with even faster computers, BaKoMa TeX Word gives us truely WYSIWYG LaTeX by simply running TeX in the background -- all that TeXmacs incremental cleverness is not so important when your computer is really fast and your document is not that long (e.g., for conference papers).  <p>So basically, faster computers made TeXmacs possible but even faster computers may make it unnecessary!",1178473745

19966,comment,19891,19891,0,0,tritchey,,,"You might want to also check out a Lisp plugin for Eclipse called Cusp ( <a href=""http://paragent.com/lisp/cusp/cusp.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paragent.com/lisp/cusp/cusp.htm</a> ). There are builds for Windows available. The other Tim that programs here at Paragent developed it, and uses it as his main development environment (I'm an emacs/slime guy). It reuses parts of slime (the backend swank server) so works in a similar manner. It also comes with SBCL, so you can get up and going pretty quickly.<p>Regarding SBCL on win32 - it is pretty stable, but is still missing some functionality that SBCL has on other platforms (threads is the big one).",1178471101

4446,comment,4431,4431,0,0,Readmore,,,"I read that it was fine to use the free one because it has less features and ads. If you pay the fee you can disable the ads and use the extra features. I don't think it's anything to worry about. If your site is big enough for Google to notice and ask you to take down your google maps integration, you have a good problem.",1173988584

4443,comment,4411,4411,0,0,python_kiss,,,"A strong antagonist makes a strong protagonist. Computer users wouldn't support the open source movement so enthusiastically if Microsoft did not exist. Genghis Khan, the prolific leader who conquered the world, learned early on that by determining a common enemy he could unite the divided Mongol tribes and unleash a force unheard of. Similarly, if it were not for IBM back in the 80's, Steve Jobs would've never been able to build a cult around Apple. Strategy, therefore, is not just the art of planning the line of attack; it is also choosing whom to fight.<p>Some smart entrepreneurs tend to use their comeptition to validate their own product. While the article is great (I mean it), it should be noted that it is not always bad to have competition.",1173988243

Blogs as we know it in its purest form will ""die"", as Sterling puts it, but this is true for all the other terminology we assign to the things we do online. It's the beauty of perpetual evolution.",1173988185

4439,comment,4304,4304,0,0,zkinion,,,"Delaware has a long, clear history of case law, which is why many companies are incorporated there.  Alot are also incorporated in Nevada (my home state).  There it's like 200$ total.  For a start-up, you normally don't need a whole lot of ""lawyer juice"" in the equation.  The forms are very simple.  You basically fill out the articles of incorporation document, then fill out a listing of officers/board members (initial listing of officers), which can be changed later.  You also need to have a resident agent, which doesn't need to be a physical place, so long as lawsuit stuff can get there.  Many places offer resident agencies as a service for as little as 99$.  The deputy just needs to be able to deliver you some lawsuit/whatever.  You send it all off to the secretary of state in whatever state you wish to incorporate, then in a few weeks later you get a copy of the forms back plus a certificate signed by the secretary of state saying that you're incorporated under that state.  Normally all states have a website where you can look up information about a particular corporation.  Every year you have to pay a few hundred bucks or so to rewnew the initial listing of officers.  It gets a little more complex if you have investors and the company is initially shared between several people/other companies, but overall, its really that simple.  <p>
Delaware might charge more because of the simple fact that so many companies incorporate there.  Finally, those ""incorporate"" services that charge a few grand basically give little advice and just fill the paper work out for you.  They take advantage of the naive.  ",1173987711

Smart money goes into companies that offer an improvement over an existing ideas.

4434,comment,4363,4363,0,0,sethjohn,,,"'Build to flip' is a fine idea. Of course you still need to make a good product, but I don't think 'build to last' is right for every company or every idea. A world with 100 new HPs every year would be top-heavy.<p>The ecosystem needs a few big companies with billions of capital and global reach, but there's nothing wrong with building up a good small idea and selling it off after a year or two to be integrated into something larger.

I'm running it in Parallels on my MacBook Pro and it's really tough to keep from throwing my Mighty Mouse across the room.  Load up XP in the same environment and I'm good to go.  Starting to wonder why I ""upgraded"" the thing.<p>Just to be balanced though (somewhat), the Office 2007 UI is slick.  It's nice to use once you get over the learning curve.  You'll catch yourself saying, ""where the hell is Paste As Special?"" for the first week or so though.

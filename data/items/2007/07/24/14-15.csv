You should be able to gain skills in four hours per day programming outside of work. \nBack when I would quit jobs to take care of stuff, I would have two productive weeks, but this would dwindle to days of reading after that. Only do it if you have enough of a goal and drive, or if this can force you into programming.",1185288668

If you're not ready to start your company <i>right now</i>, then I recommend figuring out what you can do otherwise to improve your situation.  In my case, I got a job at a much better company that's close to Boston.

For you, if you don't interact with the system at all, we just treat the site you're at as an aggregate ""user"" and guess what you'll like that way.  We think that's better than just guessing based on the site content. -Luke",1185287336

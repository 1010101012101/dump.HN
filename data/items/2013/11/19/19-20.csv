Admittedly, it has been a while, but when I tried using PHP extensions for VS in the past, debugging, unit tests, etc... all seemed to require a ton of effort or didn&#x27;t quite work the way I wanted them to. I would have loved to use VS for all development, but in this case, I felt like the tool was too weighty and not quite compatible.<p>In my particular case, I use Netbeans because it is free, lightweight, and it just works. My projects are more portable to other non-VS developers and adding PHPDocs and PHPUnit support was really easy. I&#x27;m sure there are other good IDEs as well.",1384891195

The tax benefit is relatively minimal compared to the tax risk & cost.<p>The big difference here is the company is practically non-liquid and the employee is already taking a risk in working for that startup.  I feel the 1 year vesting cliff alone is enough to evaluate if an employee is worthwhile and you should give the employee the full value of the vested stock compensation. Not add more gotchas to make the worth of the options even worse. If the company shares were liquid, then I wouldn&#x27;t care as much.<p>Often over a few years you get the situation where the strike price is a good chunk over the FMV price and taxes are somewhat prohibitive compared to the probability that a liquidity event would happen.  It makes the shares an actual net negative in total compensation and as a result, the open secret in the bay area is that most people don&#x27;t actually exercise their stock options when they leave their companies. You get things like the ESO fund popping up in response taking a good cut of your compensation because you didn&#x27;t want to pay some employees to do 20 hours of extra work a year.<p>Anyway overall, to an experienced employee who has stock option experience, it just makes your compensation package even less attractive and them less likely to work with you.  If you show that you are willing to do this relatively minor & cheap thing, it will increase trust and make your company more attractive to work for, <i>especially</i> if your a non liquid company.  I would really consider this as an early stage startup as a recruiting technique.  This stuff is usually hidden in contracts, so I would bring up this feature of your company early on explaining the logic behind it.",1384891108
6763970,comment,6759885,6759885,2,0,robomartin,,,"I&#x27;ve said this before and now I&#x27;ll generalize my statement to say that the most important issue in the electric vehicle segment is and will be that of high power and high voltage system safety, of which the battery is one component.  If the public becomes spooked by problems and accidents in this area it could set the electric vehicle market back a decade or more.<p>The real test for electrics will come when one or two million electric vehicles of all types are sharing the road.  That&#x27;s when this issue of battery and power system safety will be hugely important.  I can imagine semi&#x27;s with a million Wh battery systems rolling down the highway.  What I cannot imagine are chain reaction collisions involving a variety of electric and liquid fuel vehicles.<p>Tesla is at the forefront of this movement, which means all eyes are on them, the arrows are on their backs and they have the burden of proof.<p>One of the most expensive types of businesses to get into are those where you have to educate your customer base before a sales pitch can even begin.  Having to educating the market before you can sell to them can seriously derail one&#x27;s focus and cost bundles of money that could be put to better use elsewhere.  I&#x27;ve been in markets like that.  It&#x27;s a horrible slog.<p>Up until now, for the most part, electrics have avoided this territory.  I fear that period is ending.  Up until now the conversations about electrics were about range and relative cost when compared to gasoline vehicles.  It feels like we are now entering the domain of having to potentially prove to the market that the technology is safe as well as to remove (or stop the potential of the development of) fears of fire and electrocution.<p>Tesla, due to their position in the market, has the honor of having all microscopes aimed at everything they do.  Every mishap is amplified.  Now that the NTSB has officially opened an investigation every afternoon news show is jumping on the issues.  It will soon be everywhere.  And Tesla now has to defend, educate and prove to the market that what they are doing is safe.<p>Competitors are now going to pull back and let Tesla take the hits.  In markets where a huge investment is required in order to educate the customer base it is often a good idea to not be a pioneer.  They will let Tesla burn reputation, bleed cash and resources to deal with the challenge of getting people to be comfortable with the technology.  In these markets letting someone else slot through this phase is often the most intelligent strategy.<p>Once things settle, competitors will come in and enjoy a market segment that has been paved flat by the pioneer/s.  It is far less costly --at all levels-- to enter at that point.  The mentality of a typical potential customer --after massive investments in educating them-- is now very different.  Now customers look at the available products and think about which one to buy rather than whether or not to take a risk with this new technology.  That&#x27;s a massively different mind-set.  That&#x27;s a mind set primed for well executed product, marketing and sales strategies with wide distribution, solid sales channels and a solid post-sales support infrastructure --all of which the established players either know how to do or already have in place.<p>Manufacturers entering the market after the education phase can focus on pricing, marketing and, in general, execution rather than educating or evangelizing the audience.  There&#x27;s a huge difference in cost of sales in &quot;nicely paved markets&quot;.<p>When that happens, when the market is &quot;flat&quot; and competitors enter in force, they could run right over Tesla, push them right off the edge of the market or they could be swallowed-up by a larger organization.  Let&#x27;s not forget Tesla sold somewhere in the order of twenty thousand cars --total.  There are companies that probably sell that many cars per day.  The difference in scale is huge.<p>It is possible that Tesla is at the start of an existential threat.  It is hard to predict which way this will go.  It&#x27;s all on them now and they are all-in.  They can&#x27;t afford many more fires.  And they certainly can&#x27;t afford to have the market turn on them.  They need to be way ahead of this and spend lots of money to show people this technology is safe.  And, if it isn&#x27;t, they need to move quickly to make it safe and then show the market.  Quickly.<p>Volvo used to run commercials featuring cars being rolled and crashed in order to show how well they protected occupants.  Tesla might have to crash a few cars into concrete walls or into each other to demonstrate how survivable their high voltage and high current systems might be.  If they don&#x27;t get ahead of this and more accidents are reported the cost to regain market trust will grow exponentially.  And that could be very difficult to survive.",1384891107

They&#x27;ve been profitable since Q1 of this year and their profit margins are continuing to rise, even discounting the ZEV regulatory credits (which have been steadily decreasing for a number of quarters now).<p><i>in fact the auto industry is also trying to accomplish the same things that Tesla is</i><p>This is debatable.

But, unless someone is making a compelling electric car that&#x27;s actually better than a gasoline car, EVs aren&#x27;t really going to take off. Right now, Tesla is the only manufacturer that seems to be even trying to pursue this goal, and that&#x27;s what makes them so unique, interesting, and important.<p><i>But if you think those subsidies and bailouts are equivalent to giving extremely wealthy people a discount on a luxury vehicle...</i><p>The existing tax credits apply equally to all electric cars, not just luxury vehicles.

Unfortunately, that mechanism is still unknown, hopefully with the development of higher resolution microscopes we can get a more thorough understanding of the molecular structure.",1384890784

Besides bitcoin is meant for trading over the internet which until now has been an extreme pain.

They conserve the resource in the present for future buyers who value it more/are willing to pay more for it. And the speculator benefits of course.<p>The opportunity cost is that they could have invested in another resource/investment instead of that one. Instead someone with a lower time preference will buy that resource (ie someone who values using it in the short term more than the long term.) But is that objectively a bad thing?

What makes sense at Equinix, Juniper Networks and Opsware, all publicly-traded or acquired companies, may make little sense at an early-stage startup.<p>When equity is liquid, ongoing grants are akin to bonuses. At early-stage startups, however, the attractiveness of ongoing grants to employees ultimately depends on the perceived value of those grants. If a path to liquidity is not clear and employees are not certain that the company&#x27;s traction is producing meaningful appreciation of their existing equity, ongoing grants are unlikely to be very compelling.<p>In short, I think it&#x27;s a mistake for earlier-stage startups to treat equity as a retention tool. It can be an effective recruiting tool in some circumstances, but unless your company is a rocket ship that is going to reach the moon soon, which most early-stage startups are not, focusing too much on equity as part of the compensation package can easily hurt retention because most of the experienced and savvy employees know how to keep score.",1384889469

What would this hypothetical elderly visitor do then?<p>I think accessibility is fine and dandy in public spaces, but the line between accessibility and safety becomes quite clear when you begin considering private residences.  There are all manner of perfectly normal objects, appliances, and situations that can become dangerous in hypothetical situations involving disabled visitors.  Hell, just look at bathtubs: generally considered benign, but potential deathtraps for hypothetical elderly visitors.  Nobody is likely to replace their bathtub with a no-slip walk-in bathtub just because an elderly person is visiting, should we mandate  that all new structures be build with walk-in tubs?<p>In the context of private residences, safety issues are ones that really present an equal-opportunity risk.  Mandating circuit breakers is a clear-cut example of a safety issue, not an accessibility issue.  Something that is done solely for the sake of the disabled is a clear-cut accessibility issue.  Stair lifts, ramps, and accessible nobs are all accessibility issues.  They do nothing for the safety of the general population; they should not be framed as safety issues.",1384889210

Equity is a great motivator, and is terrific for rewarding (or even keeping employees) but most strategies don&#x27;t cover vesting and trigger events. I&#x27;ve seen several excellent employees at another job get completely screwed because they were given equity, but their shares didn&#x27;t vest until a specific trigger event (such as a buyout or a VC investment). The contract stated the employee had to be working at the company during the trigger event, so the easiest way to save money was to fire those people right before it happened. Not here during the trigger event? No vested shares and therefor no money for you. It&#x27;s a terrible strategy and quite immoral, but not illegal, so I encourage anyone who is contemplating taking shares in addition to (or in lieu of) pay, make them be very specific about the trigger events, and more importantly - if there&#x27;s any amount of those shares that are automatically vested on Day 1.<p>When we formed our company, we specifically stated automatic vesting for specific employees so they knew they were guaranteed money during the trigger event - whether they were still with the company or not. Those numbers are low, but it gives them faith we&#x27;re not going to screw them over.",1384888699

You know what&#x27;s lazy? Working on a project with millions of lines of code and deciding that digging through it to find the routine you need is more work than just coding it again.<p>My conspiracy theory is that editors that allow you to <i>enter code</i> real fast encourage a personal not-invented-here syndrome. Coding it yourself is faster than looking up how to use someone else&#x27;s code (be it code by a team member or an open-source library). If the only way to use a lib is to read bad reference docs on the internet, or, god forbid, the source, and you&#x27;re on vim/emacs/sublime, then sure, hack it together yourself. It&#x27;s faster, more fun, and all the trouble caused by code duplication and added complexity is for your successors anyway. Not your problem! This why all PHP, Ruby and Python programmers build their own HTTP request router at some point in their career (I sure did).<p>On the other side, editors that make it very easy for you to <i>discover</i>  and <i>navigate</i> code will encourage you to use existing code. Typing `someObject.` and getting a precise, documented and navigable list of exactly what you can do with that object. That causes you to use that object the way it was intended. Maybe refactor one of its methods so that it&#x27;s more flexible or general. You wouldn&#x27;t refactor a method that you don&#x27;t know existed, right? Direct, at-your-fingertips insight in the code you use, and the code you wrote last month, encourages appropriate use of said code.<p>(Sidenote: of course there&#x27;s absolutely no reason why an IDE can&#x27;t have great text-editing keybindings. I suspect that the only reason most fakevim plugins for IDEs are mediocre is because the user group is so small. After all, the average vim/emacs user looks down on IDEs)",1384888622

Jobs&#x27; stylus ban did serve as a useful forcing device: with a stylus available, pre-iPhone developers of touch UIs tended to fall back to producing bad ports of the WIMP concept, complete with buttons of minute size. But at the same time it would certainly have been <i>possible</i> to produce a good smartphone/tablet UI that was stylus-enabled. In fact I think you could, for example, port the original iPhone&#x27;s UI to a stylus-only basis fairly smoothly. You&#x27;d need a couple of extra physical buttons for call accept/reject and other instant-response actions, and you&#x27;d need some alternatives for the few places where two-finger pinch/spread gestures are really important, but otherwise it would be a pretty straightforward port with, I think, a very usable result: only slightly less appealing than the finger-touch original. Overall it seems pretty similar to Jobs&#x27; ban on cursor keys on the original Macintosh, which probably helped make early Macintosh software more Mac-native but was rolled back without difficulty later.<p>Agreed that the lack of proper stylus support is an increasingly glaring lack in the iPhone/iPad line, the largest iPads in particular.",1384888575

However, doesn&#x27;t include the games that ship with the platform and/or other bargain bin titles, so let&#x27;s just call it 8 games. Call that $160 per user lifetime, which shows just how much they were actually losing. They get additional revenue from dev kits etc, but they also lose money for advertising, spending to purchase console exclusivity, marketing, etc.<p>A recent analyst expects an attach rate of 3.25 games to new consoles,(2) which means just $65 per console not including the profits (if any) that they make on the unit itself. Considering the overall costs to R&D, build and maintain a console, it&#x27;s a pretty frightening up front cost for a long tail game.

What is nice is that all of the parts can be put together to work across the entire development team&#x27;s workflow and life-cycle. So developers, QA, project managers, Ops, etc all have a part with-in how TFS is intended to function. As a solution, this integration allows for a single solution for various aspects of team reporting, projecting, etc. So rather than having to put together all sorts of different tools for the various parts of development, TFS is a unified package. Like all software development panaceas, there are issues and problems with TFS because it can be a big and bulky thing to administer, train people to work with, get team buy-in, etc. So in some ways, it is better for an organization to grow itself with various tools that have little to no integration with each other for their specific development needs.<p>Anyhow, I say all of this because I was, not too long ago, brought into a medium sized organization that was using TFS and was asked to evaluate it against other options. What I found for this organization was that TFS was probably a best solution for their particular development process (very much a MS shop) but that they had both a poorly administered system (with most all of the reporting and project management features broken and with almost no direct QA feedback) and developers that were untrained on how to utilized all but the most basic features of the system. What made this audit particularly interesting to me was how the most productive people in the organization disliked TFS while most others were either indifferent or liked TFS because they had figured out how to game the few features that worked. So, yeah, in that case, TFS was &quot;beyond terrible.&quot;<p>TFS is not a solution I would run in a recommend wholesale but it has a lot of nifty if you look under to hood.<p>Or maybe you think that TFS is visual source safe and well, that wasn&#x27;t too great.",1384888303

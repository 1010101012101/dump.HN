Could you provide some legal reasoning behind what you consider &quot;the actual nature of the invention&quot;?<p><i>> In the most recent &quot;When Patents Attack&quot; episode, This American Life found 5,000 patents that covered the exact same &#x27;invention.&#x27;</i><p>Oh lord, was that American Life episode a bad piece of reporting about patent-related things! In the entire show, the word &quot;claims&quot; appeared not <i>once</i>! Amongst the worst reporting I&#x27;ve seen, and I say this having read stuff on techdirt!<p>But since you bring up the &quot;5000 patents on the same thing&quot; claim, allow me to talk about that.<p>The guy who made that claim works for a firm called M-CAM, who provide a service to find similar patents based on content similarity. I looked through all of the &quot;similar&quot; patents they mentioned in that episode. Each and everyone one covered specific implementations of various aspects of cloud backup such as load-balancing, availability, de-duping, I/O performance for high-latency connections, etc. They were &quot;on the same thing&quot; inasmuch that they related to the broad area of online backup, but none had any claims that overlapped. If M-CAM had any good examples of patents covering &quot;the same thing&quot;, they didn&#x27;t mention a single one on that show.<p>Furthermore, M-CAM issue reports about the strength of various patent portfolios. I looked through some of the &quot;reports&quot;. They were absolutely worthless. They considered two patents to &quot;cover the same invention&quot; if they had some keywords in common. To them, &quot;Alice is taller than Bob&quot; and &quot;Alice is less tall than Bob&quot; would be a claim on the &quot;same thing&quot;.<p>Oh, but look! M-CAM also sell a &quot;patent-risk management service&quot; [1]! Strange that their claims on that show would lead some to think the patent system as something that is overly &quot;risky&quot;, no?<p>(BTW, I am not the only one who thought M-CAM was full of crap [2].)<p><i>> They eventually invalidated it another way, after trolls collected hundreds of millions of dollars.</i><p>Interestingly, as described in the second episode, that patent was found invalid only because the inventor did not name all his co-inventors on it. He sneakily filed the patent alone, sold it to IV, and raked in millions of dollars as a cut of the royalties.<p>Leaving aside the fact that the inventor was a sleazebag, that throws the whole &quot;patent trolls pay actual inventors very little&quot; narrative -- one that the previous American Life episode played up -- right out the window. Oddly, nobody seems to report that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.m-cam.com/sherwood-patent-risk-management-services"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.m-cam.com/sherwood-patent-risk-management-service...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://gametimeip.com/2012/04/13/q-why-was-mdb-capital-right-and-m-cam-so-very-very-wrong-on-aol-patent-value/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gametimeip.com/2012/04/13/q-why-was-mdb-capital-right...</a>",1375142231

This is opposed to using the LSB on an ADC due to the speed issues.<p>Johnson noise increases in magnitude at higher bandwidth, so sampling faster is great, plus better for the computer.<p>I can also imagine a scenario where based on the bit you have a variable delay before sampling the next bit, which would defeat trying to bias it with strong fixed frequency external sources.<p>It seems that in firmware, the good hardware random number generators do things like hash the values, test them for randomness, and encrypt on the way to the computer, but that is all over my head (except maybe the hashing if it&#x27;s a standard library).<p>So, if anyone has any ideas or knows a ton about this and would enjoy poking holes in my naive implementation described above, please do so!

Drivers always try to get around you and beat you causing dangerous conditions. Passengers complain constantly and look for reasons to sue. Passengers get sick and throw up on your bus. Management sets impossible standards, so if for example you are late due to traffic it&#x27;s too bad if you need to pee at the end of one trip (where you normally get a 10 minute layover to smoke and pee) because they make you turn right around and catch up. City monitors ride the bus to evaluate everything you do. Company monitors do the same. Passengers call the company and complain if they dont&#x27; like you. Cameras are on all the time in the bus and you will get called in and questioned about anything that happened on your shift. City police won&#x27;t hesitate to write you a traffic ticket. You can have two &quot;incidents&quot; a year before you are fired. It was the hardest job I ever did, but the most rewarding because I made the grade and didn&#x27;t wash out, and on a good trip (once around) it was very Zen being the calm meditative driver (which is state the job forces you into) All for 12 dollars an hour.",1375141873

Its aim is to nullify certain advantages enjoyed by high-speed traders, such as the ability to detect large orders by less fleet-footed traders and make trades ahead of them.<p>Its backers say IEX will provide a haven for firms that are looking to swap larger chunks of stocks, such as mutual funds and hedge funds. It plans to impose a uniform split-second delay on all trades executed on the exchange, offer a limited number of order types, and forgo the widespread practice among exchanges of paying firms that post orders on their venues.<p>IEX has garnered interest from firms such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS -1.26% and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., and has attracted financial backing from fund managers including Los Angeles-based Capital Group Cos., which manages American Funds and has $1.2 trillion in assets, and Brandes Investment Partners, a San Diego firm with $25 billion under management.<p>A Goldman representative said the firm sees IEX as &quot;a true departure from the existing exchange models.&quot; More than 50 of Goldman&#x27;s institutional clients have expressed interest in IEX, the bank said.<p>Still, IEX, with about 30 employees, could have a hard time steering enough trading to its platform to reduce the need for the high-frequency element, as it hopes. High-speed trading represents about half of all stock trading, and is seen by many experts as a necessary cog in today&#x27;s computer-driven market, providing the steady flow of buy and sell orders that helps traditional, long-term investors trade.<p>IEX Chief Executive Brad Katsuyama, who spent about a decade designing sophisticated trading systems in New York for Royal Bank of Canada, says large money managers have become disillusioned with stock exchanges catering to high-speed clients. IEX&#x27;s ambition, he says, is to &quot;provide a common place&quot; for such investors to trade in relative safety by curbing the ability of quick-draw firms to detect large orders and trade ahead of them.<p>That hasn&#x27;t happened with other nonexchange trading venues, typically owned by a single broker-dealer. But no brokers will have a stake in IEX, which instead is largely owned by institutional investment firms and private investors. Mr. Katsuyama, 35 years old, hopes the distinction will encourage brokers to trade on IEX, since they won&#x27;t be trading on a competitor&#x27;s platform.<p>Regulators are turning up the heat on high-speed trading. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether stock exchanges have provided high-speed traders advantages over regular investors. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority recently sent letters to high-frequency firms seeking more information about the computer codes they use to trade, with an eye on whether the firms have proper risk checks in place.<p>Unlike dark pools, IEX plans to publish traders&#x27; buy and sell orders. It will have four order typescommands that prioritize how an investor&#x27;s orders are handled by an exchangeas opposed to the dozens of order types provided by exchanges that have drawn scrutiny from regulators.<p>IEX also will forgo the so-called rebates that many exchanges pay firms that help provide buy and sell orders. The payments, typically about 25 to 30 cents per 100 shares, primarily benefit high-frequency trading firms that provide orders.<p>At the same time, exchanges charge firms a fee for taking those orders. For firms that trade millions of shares a day, those rebates and fees add up to either a significant windfall or cost.<p>Many high-speed firms have designed strategies that allow them to pocket rebates, while brokers trading on behalf of fund clients typically pay the fees. IEX will charge a flat fee of nine cents for every 100 shares a firm buys or sells. Its hope is that firms trading solely to get a rebate will send their orders elsewhere, Mr. Katsuyama says, while brokers will pay a lower fee to trade than they do on exchanges.<p>IEX also plans to house clients&#x27; computers in a separate building from its own computer system, introducing a delay of 350 millionths of a second between the time a client sends an order from its server and when it reaches IEX&#x27;s computers. Trade information exiting from IEX&#x27;s system will have the same delay.<p>That is a departure from the practice at other stock exchanges, which place client computers in the same building as their own and have cut delays to less than 10 millionths of a second at times. The shorter delay gives high-speed firms the ability to react to trades at the exchange faster than other firms whose computers aren&#x27;t housed in the same building, among other advantages.<p>While such protections have sparked interest among big investment firms, it remains to be seen whether enough will send orders to IEX. &quot;We&#x27;re hopeful that the platform will draw liquidity to it,&quot; said Matt Lyons, who runs global stock trading at Capital Group, an IEX investor. &quot;The proof will be in the pudding.&quot;",1375141711

Getting something going fast enough is tough (G loads, aero loads, material in the launcher, etc) but doable. A really really big light gas gun should do, if the &quot;Slingatron&quot; won&#x27;t. Thing is, you cannot shoot something from the planet&#x27;s surface to orbit. Just can&#x27;t.<p>If energy is too low, you&#x27;re normal ballistic, and the projectile falls somewhere downrange. If energy is too high, you escape from Earth&#x27;s gravity well, and you never see the thing again. (This might be fine for sending materials to the Moon, though.)<p>What if the energy is just right? Well, you go into orbit with closest approach at exactly your altitude. Which is you one orbit later... if aero effects haven&#x27;t already caused enough energy loss to run the projectile into the surface, as they would on Earth.<p>(Side bar: even on the Moon or Mars, it wouldn&#x27;t work well. Orbit at the height of the highest lunar mountain would be very unstable, though it would work better than on Earth! Might get a few orbits out of it before crashing, if you can find a path without huge mascon changes, and if it doesn&#x27;t hit your launch facility. The top of Mons Olympus still has enough atmosphere to be problematic.)<p>So you have to have high-altitude propulsion to alter your trajectory once you get there, so you can orbit at a reasonable altitude. Which is why they note that they need an onboard rocket. And that&#x27;s unfortunate, because it throws away the appealing simplicity of ground launch: passive payloads (and thus low marginal costs). Now, alongside your space-gun you&#x27;ve also got to design a mass-produced probably-expendable rocket system (with guidance) that can survive wicked G loads. And so here come a lot of extra marginal and development costs and a lower payload fraction. Does your gun-and-rocket system still beat a 2/3-stage rocket? With enough volume it might, but where do you get those customers?<p>I kind of like the idea of shooting your massive space-gun at an active target that can do the orbital circularization for you; either a tug that refuels itself from the projectile, or more exotically a rotating momentum exchange tether. That on-orbit system adds additional development and capital expense, in exchange for very low marginal cost. Which would be nice if you had the volume--but nobody needs that sort of volume in space now (nor is likely to for quite some time.)<p>But once some system with reasonable development costs and acceptable marginal costs has paved the way, it might be a lovely system for bulk material transport (probably mostly volatiles, like water, but maybe also metals for construction).",1375140750

There is no evidence to back your thesis that &quot;more granted patents fuels the fire of more applications&quot;. See this graph [1] of allowance rates in 2000 - 2005 (for an explanation, ask a patent attorney or agent about &quot;Dudas&quot;) and this table [2] for number of applications over that time period. There is <i>zero correlation</i> with the steep drop in allowance rates and the rate of new patent applications over the relevant time periods.<p>2. Why do you think your idea of &quot;the right thing&quot; is actually the right thing, if any such thing exists? Just because the HN echo chamber agrees with you? As I have shown time and time again, the Internet, especially tech media, has no real knowledge of how patents work.<p>3. The Supreme Court, let alone the CAFC, the PTO and various courts, cannot even define what &quot;software patents&quot; are. How would you begin to limit or eliminate them?<p>4. None of the above entities have found sufficient rationale to exclude business method patents, let alone software patents. Contrary to popular belief, it&#x27;s not because they are stupid or technically illiterate, it&#x27;s because they are very careful thinkers and make the best of what they can given their boundaries.<p>5. The budget and staffing of the USPTO is, unfortunately, mostly independent of the number of patent applications they receive. Currently, they generate <i>more</i> fees than they are allocated a budget for, and the federal government siphons away the rest.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/PatentlyO2006059.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/PatentlyO2006059.jpg</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/us_stat.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/us_stat.htm</a>",1375139355

Some tried to free a pointer to something allocated on the stack, others tried to free a pointer twice, and one or two managed to find some undefined behavior that even you did not know about.<p>It is not that C lacks high-level structures, it is that any non-trivial C program must deal with low-level issues.<p>&quot;the student will learn these &quot;high level&quot; concepts without any clue about the underlying implementation&quot;<p>That is what computer architecture and compilers courses are for.  You learn more about the implementation of your programs by writing a compiler than you do by using C, and writing a compiler in a high-level language is almost always less painful than writing it in C.

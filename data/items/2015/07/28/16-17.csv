One important newsworthy note from this article that I think has been missed in some of the broader coverage: Washio, Postmates, and Shyp have been sued by their contractors/employees, joining the same club as Uber, Lyft, and Homejoy. This is an industry-wide issue, not isolated to just a handful of companies, and has the potential to severely damage this budding industry, as the author notes.<p>Whenever I take an Uber or Lyft these days, I always ask what the drivers think about the issue, and the uniform response so far (obviously this is anecdotal and not at all scientific) is that they like the flexibility of being able to choose when to drive. For many, this is their second job they do on weekends, nights, or early mornings. They are worried that they&#x27;ll lose this flexible source of income that are helping, for example, save for their children&#x27;s college education or pay their way through night school.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that this represents the majority view, or that the legal issue should come out any differently, but I do worry that some of these workers, happily employed as contractors, will lose out on this opportunity.",1438102451

Back in the 80s and 90s it was a justifiable viewpoint because <i>existing version control systems sucked</i>.<p>The problem with Docker is not that it doesn&#x27;t solve (or attempt to solve) widespread problems.  At its best, Docker gives you dev/production parity, and dependency isolation which is useful even for solo developers working part-time.  The problem is that it&#x27;s not a well-defined problem that can be solved by thinking really hard and coming up with an elegant model—like, for example, version control—it&#x27;s messy and the effort to make it work isn&#x27;t worth it most of the time right now.<p>That&#x27;s no reason to write off Docker though.  Pushing files to manually configured servers or VPSes is messy and leads to all kinds of long-term pain.  You can add Chef / Puppet, but it turns into its own hairy mess.

Or its possible that it was subject to an unconscious bias of its own. Perhaps the author is so thoroughly in her own echo chamber with regard to these issues that when she reached out through her network to find people willing to talk to her about why they left, she ended up recruiting largely from a population that is biased towards confirming the conclusions she wanted to demonstrate because that&#x27;s what her social network experiences disproportionately. When examining the biases of others, it&#x27;s important to examine your own and not commit the same mistakes as those you are are trying to correct. Any &quot;study&quot; without a discussion of sampling methodology to control for biases and identifying those biases is typically not constructive.<p>[0] <a href=""https://medium.com/@maradydd/when-nerds-collide-31895b01e68c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@maradydd/when-nerds-collide-31895b01e68c</a>",1438101984

I don&#x27;t even understand why you would need WebAssembly in this hypothetical scheme.<p>Container namespacing isn&#x27;t fine-grained enough, and much of this is the result of traditional Unix-likes having large disparities between different ways of naming things that cannot be composed. The Spring solution was to have all of these descend from a name service, and the Plan 9/Inferno solution to have all resources be multiplexed into virtual file systems (i.e. one way of naming things).<p>Furthermore, the inclusion of containers here gives you a worst-of-both-worlds approach. You&#x27;re not even detaching resource subsystems from a unit of execution&#x27;s POV, you&#x27;re cloning the entire OS namespace modulo disallowed subsystems for every unit of execution. That&#x27;s a combinatorial explosion of the state space.<p>It also means complicated solutions to the problem of resource management and communication within and between containers, which is a problem when virtualization occurs at a too high level. In contrast, virtualization at the process/task level with OS-wide capabilities for single-system imaging and a heavily integrated subsystem for naming things (either a one true approach or a prototype-based one) means you can configure a system like it&#x27;s a whole unit without sacrificing security.<p>Then it&#x27;s not like POSIX is even that great.

The right information in the right place just changes your life. On the other hand, information wants to be free, because the cost of getting it out is getting lower and lower all the time. So you have these two fighting against each other.&quot; (Brand 1984, via Wikipedia) //<p>It&#x27;s saying that information is valuable and so in a way it should be expensive but as we now have ways of distributing that information for little cost we can make the information free-libre and virtually free-gratis. Some people want to make the information expensive, so they alone can profit; others want to make the information free so that all of mankind can benefit.<p>>That is to say, it&#x27;s hard for me to tell people to give up the information which is, in effect, their livelihood. //<p>To me all of this, and the way industrialisation is heading, leads to a need to re-evaluate the structure of society and the way we process and share resources (physical and otherwise). But that&#x27;s not a reason not to go there, unless you wish to retain the current system where - as you note - it benefits a small minority to keep useful information from others.<p>Stallman apparently puts it this way:<p>>&quot;I believe that all generally useful information should be free. By &#x27;free&#x27; I am not referring to price, but rather to the freedom to copy the information and to adapt it to one&#x27;s own uses... When information is generally useful, redistributing it makes humanity wealthier no matter who is distributing and no matter who is receiving.&quot; (Stallman, Comp. Sec. Conf 1990) //",1438101617

While this might change over time, I can assure you that it will be very very controlled and that the newsroom has stronger veto power than marketing and advertising. I have never witnessed a scenario where an article is pushed or pulled based on what an advertiser wants and I can&#x27;t fathom how that would happen.

I can&#x27;t give specific details (for obvious NDA-related reasons), but this application was a large device that interfaced with mission-critical hardware -- and ran Windows XP embedded.<p>They&#x27;d done a pretty good job securing the OS and device itself: we couldn&#x27;t actually connect it to any networks, so network penetration testing was difficult, and there were no USB ports or CD drives. Unfortunately for them, they <i>did</i> leave an archaic port open on the back of the device.

The end result was that for every production run of this device that <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> going to one of those edge-case customers, epoxy was manually applied to close off the port.<p>Not the most elegant solution, but I guess it worked!",1438101144

Soundcloud, on the other hand, is more oriented toward releasing what&#x27;s here and now. I&#x27;ve hidden and deleted my own tracks a lot of times: sometimes they were WIPs that I didn&#x27;t want to release anyway, sometimes I decided to remove the track from public access so I can release it on a label later, and sometimes I just decided that a track sucks and should be ashamed of it.<p>Could it be that these tracks were hidden because of similar reasons? Or, may be, they were uploaded by users who didn&#x27;t have the rights to these tracks in the first place?",1438100113

I believe a vast majority of C++ users will gladly switch to a new language that offers the same level of abstractions at a comparable speed (maybe Go or Rust). For now, C++ users have to understand the language well enough to avoid its many traps and pitfalls. Moreover, new versions of the standard add to this burden. I know of no project built entirely using C++14. People will always have to deal with legacy code.<p>OOP is just another programming paradigm C++ supports. You&#x27;re not required to use it, and you&#x27;re not even paying for it if you&#x27;re not using virtual methods. Sure, C++ allows you to do a lot of funky things from overloading operators to implicit conversions but that&#x27;s another of those things everybody agrees should not be used unless explicitly necessary.

Personally, get stuff done during the week, come the weekend, it&#x27;s the beach, dinner / bars, remodeling, bike ride, etc... The harder I work during the week, the more I do on the weekend that absolutely doesn&#x27;t involve programming.<p>Keep in mind, if stuff needs to get done, it needs to get done - happened to me just this last Friday - went to dinner with the wife and parents - got a phone call from my partner about an event we were having saturday and a change needed to be made on the website. So I finished dinner, ran home (20 minute drive) made the change, then went back out to meet friends. Normally, I would have brought my laptop to dinner and left it in the car for this specific reason but I guess I thought I could get away for an hour or 2. Nope!<p>Anyways - I&#x27;ve heard &quot;work hard play hard&quot; intermixed with the term &quot;weekend warrior&quot; - someone that spends the week in an office and on the weekend, just disappears a bender. Everyone has their idea of fun.",1438099258

In 1990 all my data was housed in the Cloud, my apps ran in the cloud and I was happy to have a slice of the VAX so I could send messages to my mate in the other computer room.<p>New Browser features! Yay!  stuff it that the browser is already unsafe, slow and cumbersome - make it look Different and call it Better.<p>The point here is that the Web has always been the get rich scheme for half baked ideas ... as it ever was.<p>Nowhere ever has any Internet based service been free.  Someone Somewhere has had to pay for all of it.  The only thing &quot;new&quot; about what this author is pining about is for the Johnny Come Lately who entered the Internet, is they assume too much -- they assume they are entitled to a free service and shouldn&#x27;t have to be bothered about how it is provided.

As much as I want it to, and as much as the HN group wants to, the crazy (sad) thing is that a vast number of Americans not only do not know who he is[1], but those that do are polarized as to whether he did the right thing or not[2] - he barely won a majority vote of the minority who even know who he is.<p>[1] <a href=""https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/04/06/john-oliver-interview-political-disengagement-american-public/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/04/06/john-oliver-in...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.newsweek.com/most-americans-think-snowden-did-right-thing-poll-says-253163"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newsweek.com/most-americans-think-snowden-did-rig...</a>",1438099245

Emulating native apps is NOT inherently &quot;Good&quot;. There are terrible native apps and great ones. Navigation transitions would be nice as a another arrow in our quiver. Using it wisely is another can of worms.",1438099239

9962480,comment,9961613,9962287,0,0,tonyarkles,,,"We have the same philosophy. Most of my experience here is with iOS and Android, but also a bit of Windows/Linux/Mac. If it&#x27;s going to feel polished, then it&#x27;s going to need a separate UI front-end for each platform.<p>It&#x27;s not that there&#x27;s not yet a sufficiently good cross-platform library; it&#x27;s that an Android app and an iOS app are different! They&#x27;re structured differently! And if you try to use an x-platform library, you&#x27;re going to end up with an iOS-app-that-runs-on-Android, or an Android-app-that-runs-on-iOS, or a this-app-doesn&#x27;t-feel-right-anywhere.<p>My approach varies based on the application, but in general one of two things end up happening: either the majority of the processing gets pushed onto a server with a well-defined REST API, or the processing gets put in a C++ library that gets linked everywhere (with JNI shims, ctypes shims, whatever&#x27;s needed to load it in the appropriate environment).<p>This approach does a few things: it ensures that you&#x27;ve got a UI that fits every platform, it improves code quality (you can&#x27;t add a chunk of business logic in your view handler), and it makes porting so much easier.",1438099230

281295,comment,281143,281229,0,0,noonespecial,,,"I actually think it may be worse than all of that. In war and politics, compromise is the weapon of choice of the craziest party. Tell lawmakers that filesharing is Armageddon, that <i>beeeelions</i> of dollars are lost each year to the pirates and that the entire economy will collapse if not fixed right away. The draconian measures that are seen as the ""compromise"" (which would, if presented outright seem ludicrous) now seem tame and acceptable.<p>""Lifetime of the artist plus 70 years"" sounds so much more acceptable than ""lets just do away with this public domain thing.""",1219218750

If you don't have the identity verification, the encryption is worthless.
If my grandma went to a site with a self-signed certificate - you're damn right I'd want an error message stopping her, as there's no guarantee she isn't giving away the last of her pension money to a scammer somewhere.<p>To use your ticket analogy: a self-signed certificate would be a ticket in coach. You have no idea what plane you're getting on, or where the plane is going. I wouldn't put my grandma on a plane where I didn't know she was going. You would? :)",1219218361

281290,comment,280841,280841,0,0,hooande,,,"If you haven't read Don Norman's book, you should do it. It's called ""The Psychology of Everyday Things"" and it's a wonderful exploration of how to make products easier to use (without sacrificing functionality). The examples are a bit dated since the book is from the 80s, but the concepts all still apply.<p>My favorite quote is ""It's a shame when something as simple as a door needs an instruction manual, even if it's only one word"".",1219218086

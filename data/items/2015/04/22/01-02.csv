Some will explicitly go after a market segment interested in a certain value/quality proposition while others migt not target a specific ratio bit are placed there by the market itself.<p>Apple and Mercedes are not interested in the buyer looking for the lowest price who cares not about quality.

It a default like any OS environment the average user would be used to for instance on their system or a VM.<p>As an experienced user you can appreciate that distinction for new users. Also Docker was designed with the single app restriction. It&#x27;s a significant difference with LXC. The Docker OS template is intentionally restricted to do this. You can work around it but if it is your intention to multiple apps why not just use LXC itself? It&#x27;s there for a purpose which the Docker site, and ecosystem articulate.<p>A lot of your other points are coming from an in-depth understanding of both LXC, Docker and the operating system.

9418138,comment,9414869,9417417,0,0,notahacker,,,"Generally the principle behind designing sales compensation works along these lines<p>(i) First figure out a notional target amount of revenue you would expect a salesperson doing reasonably well to generate over a time period. [1]\n(ii) Then offer sales role(s) with a base salary and a higher[2] OTE (on target earnings) figure reflecting their expected earnings (including salary) if they hit this notional target. This is what the compensation will be advertised as, and how it&#x27;ll be benchmarked against rival company salaries \n(iii) In the simplest case, the salesperson gets paid the base salary plus (OTE - SALARY)/TARGET per unit of revenue they book during the course of a reporting period[3]... \nAs they probably over or undershoot their target by quite a bit, chances are they earn more or less than the magical OTE \nCommon variations on the simple case include increasing the commission percentage for sales over the target (or various other thresholds) to weight incentives in favour of the lowest performer, setting a base threshold so the salesperson doesn&#x27;t earn any commission at all until they&#x27;ve reached this minimum tolerable level of performance, and offering fixed cash bonuses for various other achievements. Salespeople looking after a mixture of new and existing accounts might find their OTE composed of separate targets for new and retained business with different percentages, or they might have a single target with new sales required to cancel out the losses.<p>Either way, the compensation is usually calculated based on when the revenue gets booked and paid at the end of the quarter, month or week. So salespeople might get paid before client pays, but they might get paid three months after if they&#x27;re on a quarterly commission scheme.<p>[1]Of course definitions of reasonable vary, and any kind of targeting might be more alchemy than science, especially in a startup. \n[2]Maybe a mere 15% above the base salary (if the sales role is mostly admin and the salesperson isn&#x27;t expected to boost the figure through excellent work) or it might be more than triple the base salary (typically promoting above-market achievable earnings as an upside for accepting below-market base salary, much like the high-equity offers for developers)\n[3] the reporting periods is probably a quarter or a month, but possibly weeks for very transactional sales or years for the 4-deals-a-year enterprise roles).",1429665394

For the most part, the strategic aspect of these games disappears when you have enough information about who has choosen what so far.<p>On the parking point—there do seem finally to be some real efforts underway to gather data about parking availability. At an average cost of about $40,000 per spot in a parking structure and low overall utilization, it&#x27;s astounding that it&#x27;s taken this long for serious attempts to emerge to find ways to allocate parking more efficiently. In addition to solutions that involve putting sensors in situ, car-makers are starting to think about how they can use the ever-expanding array of sensors in their vehicles to map parking spaces and track their availability [1].<p>But there are surely other open problems of the same sort that Density&#x27;s data could help solve: how many people are jamming into the subway right now, or how many are at the farmer&#x27;s market already? In this common sort of situation, your experience depends on how many other people are doing what you&#x27;re contemplating doing, and your behavior will (or would) change with better information about who&#x27;s doing what.<p>Look for those sorts of problems to apply your data to, I&#x27;m suggesting. There might also be opportunities to map demand irrespective of supply. In the parking situation, for instance, tracking the number of open spaces only gets you so far; you also want to know how much aggregate demand there is, because that helps you figure out whether to build more capacity. Second-order statistics like how many people are checking a location&#x27;s activity in the app can help you estimate that sort of thing.<p>0.

2. Now that we're loading the page with the cookie, present the form.
3. Upon submission of the form, validate that this IP was previously assigned this cookie, record the ip-cookie-vote triplet.  Throw out the vote if that IP hasn't been assigned that cookie.<p>If a scripter wants to automate requests, they'll have to figure out that they need to get the cookie from you, then use it to vote.  You can detect abnormally large ip-vote (and timeframe) combinations and automatically, or later manually, discard anomalous results.<p>It's not perfect of course, but there is no such thing as a perfect internet survey (unless you're going to mail out SeucurID fobs or some such to the participants).",1238936248
547333,comment,547256,547256,0,0,geuis,,,"I'm a big fan if jQuery and haven't used Ext. However this post does nothing to convince me to switch. It really seems all of the authors points boil down to ""I think they're both tied, but Ext is better because I like it.""<p>jQuery makes writing javascript much simpler. By this, I mean that it let's me write code to do what I want and not to get bogged down in the pecular aspects of the framework language. I have recently tried YUI and completely hated it for this reason. No consistency or simplicity to the framework. Doesn't help me build products faster.",1238936247

It sounded like the system was largely a success, except that they set the maximum level at their highest-ranked people and stopped.  Those people got frustrated because they had no way to move upwards.<p>At Fog Creek, there are several levels that no developers have achieved yet.  I'm fairly certain that if someone did achieve those levels they'd rearrange the system to create a few more levels, so that everyone has something to reach for and some idea of how to continue to improve themselves.",1238935713

547323,comment,546908,547307,0,0,froo,,,"I am definitely an early Disney film fan (from an animation perspective).<p>Another book you might read is actually written by two of Disney's ""Nine Old Men"" called ""The Illusion of Life"" (Pixar actually did an homage to them in <i>The Incredibles</i>)  and it talks about not only the specific techniques that they created, but also the attitude of the studio in the early days.<p>It's actually interesting to read the history on something like Apple and also Disney and see the many similarities between the two companies in their early days.<p>Early Disney was definitely a startup that had a lot of the hacker values.<p>Walt was definitely on another plane of thinking. My favourite quote of his is:<p><i>“I can never stand still. I must explore and experiment. I am never satisfied with my work. I resent the limitations of my own imagination”</i><p>- Walt Disney",1238934870

However, there are definitely a certain set of parents who go to extreme lengths to get little Bobby in the Right State School, since the quality varies so much.<p>There are frequently TV programmes and newspaper articles about parents who move just to get their kids in certain schools; who have second homes and pretend they live there; who buy to sublet etc; all just to be in the catchment area for particular schools.<p>It's understandable on one level, but still ridiculous.",1238933847

When you deliberately use a phrase designed to insult people their natural biases kick right in. So the commenter's view that ""except no-one uses it, its syntax is uglier"" immediately is accepted as truth. I guess freedom is cancerous, once one person has it everyone wants it.",1238933055

It sounds obvious but if you spend the money on getting Digg frontpaged or an ad on Penny-Arcade the customers presumably won't actually stick, since they're not your target audience.<p>Can you set up a myspace page? Add Facebook integration, a Facebook fan page, etc? Advertise on Livejournal? Celebrities is a good one as someone else mentioned, also fashion and style sites - with the death of print, could you even afford to advertise in Cosmo or the teenage equivalents? As well as casual gaming sites and possibly MMO sites, as plenty of women play MMOs and look for other distractions as well.<p>To be honest although I'm a twentysomething girl I'm somewhat atypical and don't really know what sites my 'demographic' visit - but you need to find that out. Maybe look at some of your competitors too, there are a ton of casual games out there.<p>If you've got 10k users already maybe you can incentivise them to recruit a friend with some of the marketing budget as well.

7995141,comment,7994815,7995094,1,0,techadv,,,"I have no idea how defining the type of a function&#x27;s domain is supposed to be indicative to dynamic dispatch or associated methods with classes. I think I don&#x27;t understand your example :-( Perhaps you can elaborate, since I don&#x27;t know much about either of these languages.<p>Regarding existential types: yes, there&#x27;s an intimate relationship between existential quantification and OOP. But you can distinguish the difference between OO languages and (non-OO languages with existential types) in the type theory. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s important. I think the raw empirical nature of my academic community consensus test is far preferable to the author&#x27;s epistemological argument.<p>The question is whether OOP has meaning. I think if the PL community can be empirically demonstrated to have enough consensus that languages are reliably categorized as OO or non-OO, then we can safely say the term has meaning regardless of any armchair philosophy to the contrary.<p>Edit: And I think (hope) the author of the article would agree my test is sufficient. He states: <i>When I say that there’s no such thing as OO, I mean, more precisely, that there exists some abstraction (or several) that is referred to as “object-oriented”, but that this abstraction has no actual referent in reality. It is an abstraction that is made in error. It is not necessary, and serves no cognitive purpose. It is “not even false”.</i>.<p>If OO has enough meaning to an important subgroup of people that they can use it with more-or-less consensus, then the claim that it has no referent in reality is clearly empirically denied, at least for that subgroup. And if that subgroup happens to be a large chunk of the PL community, then I think that&#x27;s an important enough subgroup to settle the larger question.",1404669567

Find jobs that are using technologies that are in high demand for companies that respect your work-life balance.  Temporary spikes in hours comes with the territory but working 50+ hours a week isn&#x27;t required.  Startup work may have that kind of grind but there are plenty of companies where you can advance your career quickly without sacrificing your work/life balance.<p>I think the key is learning technologies that are in demand and pay well and choosing jobs where you can build experience in said technologies.  Bottom line is that if you spend 60+ hours a week at a job programming in Objective-C for 3 years you&#x27;re unlikely to make significantly more money than the guy who has 3 years of Obj-C and only worked 40 hours a week.

So to figure out our concept it may be worth taking a look at what the use of object-oriented features is, and use that as a starting point. Maybe, again I am a little rusty on my inductive reasoning.<p>I think one thing that strikes me with Object-oriented programming in general is the idea of data management and function management.<p>I guess if we look at the features that are associated with object-orientation (I am not pretending that I am being strictly inductive at this point, although I think this is vaguely inductive), I would say that it takes the management and organization of programming concepts, such as data and function organization, and embeds it into the language itself.",1404668529

As an example, I remember seeing a snippet from an interview once where General Alexander even said they should have been more open with the public about the 215 program (I can&#x27;t seem to find the link right now).  We haven&#x27;t heard much about the similar e-mail program that was discontinued back in 2011.  If Snowden had stopped there, I don&#x27;t think there would be nearly as much debate.<p>As a counterexample, those dragnet concerns don&#x27;t apply to PRISM/Section 702, which is targeted exclusively against foreigners.  I don&#x27;t think there was any reason to notify every adversary in the world that our government could get access to their Gmail/Hotmail/Yahoo accounts.  Snowden didn&#x27;t open up a debate there, he unilaterally made a decision on behalf of the American people to reduce the effectiveness of our intelligence services.<p>As for the second thought experiment, no I&#x27;m not okay with that, either.  That said, espionage is mankind&#x27;s second oldest profession - they&#x27;re not going to stop and it&#x27;s silly to think that shutting down the NSA will somehow cause them to stop.

7995016,comment,7994815,7994815,4,0,kazinator,,,"&quot;Object-oriented programming&quot; in its basic form means that the data manipulated in a computer program is self-describing. We can ask a datum, &quot;what are you? what type?&quot;. The functions of that program are organized around data. This is in contrast with the form of programming in which data is just some storage, which is given a meaning by the algorithm that operates on it; it is not self-describing.<p>Self-describing data lets us then have generic operations. For instance, if an object hold a sequence of other object, we can create an operation which extracts the N-th one. And we can make that same operation work for an object which is a character string, vector, list. This is because the function can inquire the object what it is, and then call the appropriate concrete implementation which does the right thing for that type.<p>This leads us to realize that type is connected to the operations which are applicable. Those objects are somehow of the same &quot;kind&quot;.  This gives rise to the concept of subtyping and substitutability: a string is a kind of sequence and so is a list and we can have operations on sequences.<p>The non-object-oriented concepts are all that cruft from various languages which tries to strangle OO: virtual base classes, protected members, methods within class scope, scope resolution, copy constructors, yadda yadda ad nauseum ...\nWe are led to believe that OO requires this or requires that. It&#x27;s not OO if there is no encapsulation. It&#x27;s not OO if there is no language-enforced &quot;information hiding&quot;. It&#x27;s not OO if there is no private/public access mechanism. It&#x27;s not OO if method calls aren&#x27;t represented as message passing. It&#x27;s not OO if methods aren&#x27;t in a compile-time class scope together with data members. ...",1404666897

Nearly two-thirds of the patients were younger than 20. &quot;Parents go to raw milk because they hear it&#x27;s good for kids&#x27; allergies,&quot; says Michele Jay-Russell, a veterinarian and food safety specialist at the University of California-Davis who has studied the outbreaks. But children&#x27;s developing immune systems are more vulnerable than those of adults. &quot;They end up sickening their kids,&quot; Jay-Russell adds.</i>",1404666111

Since I view lazy reporters and SEO as parasites anyways, the choice is clear for me.<p>Reframing this issue as a &quot;security from dictatorial abuse of power&quot; is playing the same game as the NSA.

Some children might not benefit as much or at all from breastfeeding, but it would be irrational not to breastfeed your child unless you suspected that your child was an exception.<p>There isn't a best practice for facet of child development, but I think it would be a huge mistake to come away from this article believing that no best practices exist.",1218519022

If I were in middle school, doing a research paper on In-N-Out, I could see the appeal.  It seems fairly humming with information.  Certainly it feels like it could fill a poster board.<p>Mostly, it seems to be trying to anticipate my <i>next</i> search related to In-N-Out.  Did I really mean ""In-N-Out videos""?  Did I mean ""where's the nearest In-N-Out""?  Did I mean ""what does 'animal style' actually mean?""<p>But really, if I had wanted any of those things, wouldn't I have used those as my search terms?

The reason behind this might be the fact the real science doesn't make for entertaining reading or more likely journalists explain difficult things in an more entertaining way.",1218517374
273723,comment,273625,273625,0,0,Alex3917,,,"The reason there aren't more science submissions is probably just that there isn't very much good science writing on the web. Most of the science articles being written today are basically just poorly summarized press releases covering cleantech, medicine, space, and the physical sciences. Most of the announcements are bullshit to begin with, and the fact that the writers don't know what they're talking about makes it even worse. If there were people who went out and read interesting journal articles and wrote up the results in a readable way then I'd be all for that, but the number of people doing that is basically zero. Aaron Schwartz et al. were trying to do that for a while on their blog Science That Matters, but they don't seem to even exist anymore.",1218517265

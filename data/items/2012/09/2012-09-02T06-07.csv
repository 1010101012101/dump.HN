These players, who I guess number in the 80% of all players on the site , meaning every room, every stake has these cheaters in them, colluding and cheating.  They can see or are getting fed your hold card info... They know what you have .  See for yourself. Play a few rounds normally, then cover up your cards by pressing on a profile pic while playing. It literally covers up your cards so even you can't see. This somehow interferes Witt their ability to read the screen, and they will flip out... You ll see.  Also, they do this by sending a weird, vibrating signal while youre at the table, this signal , which shakes the table and your iPad slightly, somehow either retrieves your info or eliminates whatever it is that protects your covered cards info.  You ll see. Have fun, and let's get these cheaters out.",1346569039

They seem like a great idea in theory - if there are known error states, then making them explicitly known and forcing the consumer to acknowledge them in some way seems reasonable. In practice, a lot of the time the only response to a checked exception is ""let it propagate up - there isn't anything useful I can do"", which leads to extra code and can be annoying.<p>Even though I don't have quite the negative feelings toward them others do, if I were involved in designing a new language today, I'd probably vote against including them. It would possibly be nice if a method could explicitly declare which exceptions it was likely to throw, and then an IDE or static analysis tool could use those to aid consumers of the API, without forcing them to deal with every single one.<p>Interestingly enough, I view Scala's <i>Option</i> construct as being somewhat similar - forcing the consumer to acknowledge that a particular call could return a null value - but it doesn't seem to provoke the same negative visceral reactions that checked exceptions do.",1346568850

Almost by construction, nearly every article starts with ""X is a Y""  (modulo grammatical niceties) where Y is a more general class to which X belongs. In cases when the article doesn't follow that form, the first linked term is usually still explanatory or definitional in some sense and hence more general, and cases where that doesn't apply (e.g. Obstacle) are unusual enough that they don't generally break the cycles. There are no ""Wikipedia axioms"" that I know of, so this is pretty much guaranteed to end in a cycle looping through a limited set of terms used to talk about abstract concepts.

I read this whole article with a growing feeling of incredulity, not about the cheating that it describes (yes, I understand that there are confabulators of this type - Stephen Glass was already mentioned in the comments), but about the effort and space that a national magazine would spend on this story. I kept waiting for SOMETHING of momentous importance towards the end somewhere that would justify all this buildup, but it never came. Yup, a guy cheated in a bunch of races. Yup, he is a confabulator who will invent any number of details and fake personas to build up his fantasies. Yup, he was caught in due time. You could summarize this in five lines. This is not just beating a dead horse, this is shooting it with a howitzer, repeatedly.<p>The only truly interesting detail would be the method by which he cheated, which the reporter, at long last, admits that nobody has figured out. This leaves the possibility that other people are cheating the same way, although maybe less brazenly. Again, this could be summarized in a line (it's clear that he cheated, the method is difficult to figure out). What is this, a slow news year?",1346566417

Stay in gorgeous, perfectly renovated apartments in pre-WWII residential buildings with high ceilings, right in the middle of the center and pay a fraction of costs of any other capital (even cheaper than any Eastern European capital). No need for a carBerlin has one of the densest subway nets and wide streets make biking fun. In addition, Germany has an amazing social health care system including health, unemployment and pension (when working as an employee).<p>2. A vibrant and fast growing ecosystem of smart people. A vast number of new software talents, founders, software companies and VCs are moving to Berlin, every day (Twitter, Google, Soundcloud, Early Bird and many more).<p>3. People here are open-minded, outgoing, mix well and internationalno need to learn German, everyone speaks English! Making new friends is a matter of days. Visit tons of networking and startup events, every week.<p>4. Easy work permissionsEuropeans do not need any and can work from day one and the rest applies for the hassle-free Blue Card.<p>5. Berlin's night life is unmatched, huge and changing every day (plus ridiculously cheap). Berlin has got some of the most dazzling, naughty, and original clubs on the face of the Earth.<p>Berlin is calling and getting the new tech hub of Europe. If you are passionate about building great software, wed love to talk with you. If you don't live in Berlin yet, we could help to fix that.<p>=> <a href=""http://urge.io/jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://urge.io/jobs</a>",1346566167

284908,comment,284373,284374,0,0,ironcondor,,,"From the research:<p>""Political scientists and psychologists have noted that, on average, conservatives show more structured and persistent cognitive styles, whereas liberals are more responsive to informational complexity, ambiguity and novelty. We tested the hypothesis that these profiles relate to differences in general neurocognitive functioning using event-related potentials, and found that greater liberalism was associated with stronger conflict-related anterior cingulate activity, suggesting greater neurocognitive sensitivity to cues for altering a habitual response pattern.""<p>I was just trying to be accurate.  I could have use the phrase ""wired differently,"" but there are no wires in the brain.  Whether we know the specific physical differences or not, the profound observation is that there is one.  And the basis of our thoughts, opinions, etc, is neurochemical.",1219535832

Also recently added sharded counters as per some best practices suggested by Google.<p>I'll report on a more substantial app once it gets some testing.<p>A good list of apps on App Engine: <a href=""http://appgallery.appspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://appgallery.appspot.com/</a>",1219535416

Nearly everything can be expressed as combinations of those.<p>Actually, if you have generalized folds (folds over all data types, not just lists), <i>all recursion</i> can be expressed in terms of a fold.  That's the point of a fold function: it captures the recursion pattern over a data type, letting you parameterize just the specific operation that replaces the constructor.<p>In practice, I found that the mutability of basic structures was more of a problem.  By default, your subscripting/attribute assignment all mutate the original object instead of creating new ones.  When I did FP in Python, I did a few decorators to hide this, but it still felt like an ugly kludge that was fighting the language.",1219533142

7316773,comment,7316526,7316718,11,0,nostrademons,,,"Yeah, when I looked at the data in the article, the pattern wasn&#x27;t that SEC employees were systematically selling stocks they were investigating.  Rather, it was that they were always selling, and refused to buy stocks under investigation.  This is consistent with the SEC&#x27;s policies, and also makes a lot of sense.<p>I would chalk this up to a quirk of statistics rather than any deliberate malfeasance.  (Although, I&#x27;d note that the SEC policy that employees sell any stocks of a company that they will be investigating is good for the employees, because those companies are disproportionately likely to suffer a stock price penalty in the near future.  Basically, the <i>policy</i> is a way of turning material non-public information into a market advantage without requiring that any individual employee act on that.  But this situation exists in a lot of other cases, eg. stock option grants should systematically beat the market because companies that are financially healthy are more likely to hire people, and that financial health usually translates into hiring before it translates into profits.)",1393552760

To some extent it depends on what you are doing.<p>What I do think that Perl is really good at is building frameworks and the reason here is that what you can do (and what I highlighted in the article) is create mini-dsl&#x27;s for common tasks which can then be seamlessly worked into the general purpose programming environment.

While some might argue that most female gamers simply stay away from such titles, I question this assumption and wonder if this is another instance of the girlie-beer phenomenon.<p>i.e. In recent years, several brewers have attempted to market beer to women with pink packaging and, in some cases, pink dye in addition to supposedly &quot;girl friendly&quot; qualities such as being low-calorie, not too strong tasting, etc..  The problem is, women who don&#x27;t want to drink beer won&#x27;t, and women who like beer want good beer, not beer made for women who don&#x27;t like beer.  So far these girl-branded beers have all been abject failures.<p>Would more female gamers play blood-and-guts action games if they were gratuitously girly, or would it barely be more than those who don&#x27;t mind playing as muscle-bound brutes when they crave a bit of the ol&#x27; ultraviolence?  I&#x27;m not saying that the industry shouldn&#x27;t do more to marginalize misogynistic characterizations, but I do suspect that male protagonists and testosterone driven character interactions tend to give blood-and-guts games more credibility even with female audiences. That should change slowly with time, as we&#x27;re seeing in cinema, but we should also recognize that this is the present we&#x27;re currently dealing with.  Women aren&#x27;t an audience that are being ignored.  It&#x27;s what they want that&#x27;s the problem!<p>It&#x27;s also worth noticing that we are very selective about what we define as &quot;guy stuff&quot; in male dominated video games.  It&#x27;s definitely not &quot;older guy&quot; stuff.  e.g. When was the last time you saw a male protagonist blow thousands of enemies to bloody giblets and, in the next scene, talk about his prostate problems, the virtues of fiber, and his receding hairline?  Really, these games are about violence.  If a woman does the slaying, it doesn&#x27;t bother most male gamers at all.  It&#x27;s when they start talking about the female analogues to &quot;old guy stuff&quot; that <i>everybody</i>, males and probable females alike, start to get itchy trigger fingers.<p>This tendency of most video games to sate adolescent desires for violence while ignoring more mature material is, in my opinion, of equal concern to both genders.  Any game that makes male-female relationships a part of core game-play instead of an optional bolt-on is instantly branded as a weird Japanese dating simulator for Otaku&#x27;s who never leave their houses.  Games that focus on drama or exploration without &quot;sufficient&quot; violence are frequently viewed as having &quot;boring gameplay&quot;.  Video games are no longer an emerging art-form.  Their gross sales have surpassed that of cinema!  However, video games are still stuck in the Nickelodeon era.  Practically everything is gratuitous violence with a smattering of sex. However, only now are adult audiences starting to outnumber adolescent ones.  The next few decades for video games may well be remembered similarly to the early twentieth century when cinema progressed from being a low-brow diversion to an art-form that fascinates all!",1393550953

7316594,comment,7316059,7316389,5,0,egypturnash,,,"Hi! I&#x27;m a female video gamer.<p>I grew up playing video games. I have played, and still play, a lot of games involving shooting things, punching and kicking things, and colorful explosions. I got hooked on the medium with Williams&#x27; &quot;Defender&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t play FPSs because they are, with very few exceptions, coded as Games For Guys. I&#x27;ve had a great time playing Portal, System Shock 2, Antichamber, and a few other first person puzzle shoot things, because they are either genderless, or are strongly feminine. (You would destroy me in a high-speed deathmatch because my &#x27;put cursor on dude&#x27; skills are minimal - largely because almost every single &#x27;put cursor on dude&#x27; game requires me to inhabit the grey/brown shoes of Mancho McGruntsalot, so I really don&#x27;t feel like playing them.)<p>I avoid most AAA games for similar reasons. They are all clubhouses with a &quot;NO GURLS ALLOUED&quot; sign hung out front. I played the hell out of Skyrim and Saint&#x27;s Row 3/4 in no small part because I could make female avatars and the game would happily let me be that. (For that matter, I basically quit buying the 3D GTA games when they stopped having any &#x27;play as another model&#x27; codes that I could input to force the game to acknowledge my gender. Even if it did sometimes result in a cutscene where a lady model stood with her legs wide open, talking in a male voice, and dangling a gun in front of her crotch obscenely.)<p>I have a bunch of lady friends who have spent tons of time playing MMORPGs. I haven&#x27;t, myself, because I know I&#x27;d fall into that hole and never come out - but again: easy access to female avatars right there in the stock game, no hassle, hey maybe we&#x27;ll welcome women.",1393549936

I was actually wondering what programmers in their mid-20s today are going to be doing when they&#x27;re, say, 70. How many programmers in their 70s do we have today? Very little, because computing was in its infancy 50 years ago. With every generation, more and more are being exposed to computing/programming at an early age.<p>You also have to remember that there are tinkerers in not just the computing field. Think about the weekend woodworkers, car guys, model aircraft enthusiasts; could many of them be tinkering with software if they were exposed and educated in it at the right age? I say yes. On the macro scale, we are only at the dawn of computing and the internet, and there are going to be MANY more people working on it in the future.",1393549536

Women certainly don&#x27;t make half of gamers (unless you consider people playing Tetris and phone games real gamers, and that&#x27;s a very different subject altogether).<p>Fewer are playable, false claim as well. Tomb Raider, Bayonetta, Most adventure games from Roberta Williams, Lots of japanese games have female lead characters too (too many to list here), and a lot of these games were very much liked by male gamers as well. I&#x27;m personally a huge fan of Bayonetta, and the fact that the character is a female had a huge part in this preference.",1393549522

You&#x27;ll notice that it&#x27;s got a very wide data width (not a new idea) that speeds it up tremendously for parallizeable tasks, but it&#x27;s actually slowing down the &quot;clock&quot; since the memory itself is still the slowest part.<p>(I also upvoted you ... you shouldn&#x27;t get penalized for an honest question)",1393549412

We basically had to wait for late SNES games and PS1 games to see more and more games on consoles with deeper storylines and character development. But this occured on PC way before it happened on consoles, and you had actual strong female characters way before on PC too (hey, come on, the Roberta Williams games had almost always female protagonists, and were hugely popular!).<p>The idea that &quot;we had to wait until 2014 to feel something when playing games&quot; is what I considered the most painful.

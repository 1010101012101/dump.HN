But thats besides the point I was trying to make.<p>While I enjoy the feeling of creation and I like doing fancy stuff on my computer, I still recognize that all code boils down to those three things I listed. No matter how artsy you get about it. I argue that creativity and expressiveness would be enhanced by having a common language that we could all understand and share our own skills through it. I like to think that if we had this utopistic language, the teaching of programming would become easier and it would be started earlier for students. Also the quality of the teaching would improve significantly.<p>Language is but a tool to transfer ideas out of your head to others, the better you are at one the easier it becomes. QuickSort works like it does because thats the algorithm. A linked list is like that because thats the data structure. I don't think it matters how you learn these concepts and how you visualize them in your head. My native language is not english but still I can think in it, through practice. I think the same applies to programming languages, just as long as the language has that expressive power. If it doesn't confine itself to a singular style or paradigm but lets you choose, isn't that the most expressive of languages?",1329544031

I told a couple of folks what I'd made and they asked about a web based version, which I now have the bare minimum functionality for it to be really useful.<p>I need some additional folks to start using it to make sure the core is there and performance/load is where it should be.

It currently uses the Google auth, so you'll need a gmail account to sign in.  I'd just make it live, but I intend to charge for it out of the gate and haven't completed the billing portion and want to make sure it's usable by other folks before fully setting it loose.<p>Description:
Finivus was inspired by the number of applications that exist to help people manage lists of things they need to accomplish. Rarely is such a list used only for the things necessary to accomplish today and rarely do such lists provide a reasonable mechanism for determining which tasks need to be done today, tomorrow or on any given day. Following from that, most tasks have a lifetime or window when they should be accomplished. An application that allowed you to annotate when a task can (or should) be accomplished would make the management easier but puts the burden on the user of the application.<p>Finivus is an entirely different approach. When a task is added that needs to be accomplished, the period it should be accomplished in is added as well. Finivus then distributes the tasks amongst available days. The system does not allow reordering of tasks or delaying tasks. Instead, if a task is not accomplished on the day it is scheduled, it is merely added back to the pool of tasks to schedule starting on the next day. The resulting schedule is deterministic, but is not guaranteed to change. The rationale is that tasks that are due today or are overdue should take precedence over other tasks and that a task would not be added if it didn't need to be accomplished.<p>The system of no penalization, even distribution of tasks and disallowing the picking and choosing of which tasks to accomplish encourages the user to accomplish the tasks that are scheduled, even if they are unpleasant or the user would rather not do them. This new approach becomes much more of a task manager rather than just a todo list.",1329543119

3606019,comment,3605503,3605503,2,0,dmk23,,,"The fact of the matter is ""the best"" companies naturally have investors competing to get a piece.<p>What defines ""the best"" and what creates true competition is quite fickle. The private equity market, despite all recent changes, is still inherently inefficient. So I'd venture to say there are several dynamics going on:<p>1) Social Proof: Many investors are just lazy and won't look beyond who is introducing or vouching for the deal. Nothing wrong with that, it is a legitimate defense mechanism, but this limits what they actually pay attention to and creates frenzy around half-baked projects with ""superstars"" onboard. Think Color.<p>2) Right Fad: This is closely related to the previous point. If an investor has a theory that something ""just like XYZ"" is the next big thing, they might be willing to overlook a LOT of legitimate red flags. This could create a frenzy around a certain space or make them avoid another because ""it is played out"", which is often wrong.<p>3) Their Knowledge: On one hand this is what they legitimately understand about the space to make their own intelligent judgement of why there is an opportunity. That is the type of investor with the most potential to bring something useful if they can explain: ""because I've done this and this, I can contribute this"". Flip side, experience often means pre-conceived notions, with Exhibit #1 being YC's bias against solo founders.<p>4) Actual Metrics: If your numbers speak for themselves quite a few investors would want in just on this basis. The flip side it might be too late. Another flip side is investors might think a deal is overpriced or they cannot get enough control, etc. Best companies though are able to execute regardless of who invests or not invests. That's where you can have a legitimate competition on who is allowed to invest, based on what they offer.<p>5) Hidden Gems: Investors can often get the best deals by being early enough but that's where you have to find something new, that has a good chance of success, bring something to the table and get a better deal. But this requires to pay attention and do some actual work, so not everyone wants to do this vs. try to co-invest in the latest syndicate someone else is putting together.<p>If you are an entrepreneur you want to maximize your outcome, but if you focus all your time on jumping through the hoops of investors who do not actually understand what you do or have much to contribute you are being distracted from actual business. Note, I am not using the word ""startup"" here, because every successful startup is a business. Ignoring this simple fact is what gets people into trouble, leads to bad deals or puts them on the road to failure.<p>So yes, investors pitching to entrepreneurs could be a great idea but it works only if both parties bring the right mindset to the table and can articulate their value proposition.<p>PS: As entrepreneur you have to be extra careful with people who invest mainly based on social proof / fads. Do not expect them to do much for you, though their involvement might be a social proof for someone else who would make an actual contribution.",1329542889

Lets say you put together such a network, as you cover stories you put them up on your server. Your customers click 'the news' and they get a newscast of all the current news, but once they've seen a story they don't see it again unless there is actually additional information.<p>Things like sports highlights, weather, and finance have a regular 30 minute update cycle. So push the button and you can watch a 'show' which is probably 30 - 40 minutes long of the current news. If you watched the news this morning and its a slow news day the icon indicates no new updates.<p>You click news you are interested in and it tailors your broadcast to you're interest. Don't care about entertainment? not there. Don't want to hear about the latest hijinks on the debate circuit, not there. Interested in updates on NASA's budget? there.<p>You can surface potential stories of interest in the 'crawl', click/press it and that story gets added to your newscast.<p>Same basic organization as any other news organization, but the transmission is network based.<p>News transition Nightly -> Morning + Noon + Night -> 24hr<p>Differentiation Liberal leaning / Conservative / more local / less local / more weather / more sports / etc.<p>Monetization - advertising.<p>Disruption - remove transmission costs, pull cable networks out of the middle, move to NetFlix/AmazonPrime/Hulu with a higher revenue share.

At least those are non-ambiguous.)<p>2) Touch screens are quite possibly the best way invented by man to smudge display hardware. Even when a touchscreen has been forgone in favor of a touch pad below the display. Between greasy, sticky, food, dirty hands, and just plain wear, I basically have to constantly damage my display to interact with the device. Which is why most people end up getting a case. (Case-hell is its own subject really.)<p>3) Specifically for the case of video games, there is nothing more frustrating then the <i>interface</i> effecting your ability to play the game. Considering that the latency of wireless controllers is considered too much by the most hardcore of gamers, it stands to reason that touch interface will be universally looked down upon by anyone playing anything more complex than say; wii bowling.<p>Addressing your concept of a touch pad on the back to save the poor screen. Your forgetting that most people hold mobile devices in such a way that a touch pad on the back would be constantly triggered simply by holding the device with a firm grip. (And encouraging people to hold it with anything less is a bad idea considering how fragile they are.)<p>I expect buttons to be around for a <i>long</i> time to come.",1329541678

If you criticize then do it constructively. I mean show me a site/blog which has brought so many founders (both successful and unsuccessful) to their knee to spit out their real life experience and I will take your word.
And I am sure there are so many niches out there screaming to be exploited in other fields (biotech, pharma, commodities etc).",1329541451

For example Backbone is minimal, while Ember is more featured but with bad documentation and not proven yet. Big frameworks with UI widgets never caught on and are too restrictive. GWT is also on the down and out, etc...<p>2) Same goes for the tools you need for debugging, unit testing, automation, etc. Nowhere as complete as the server side tools that have been honed for 10+ years.<p>3) Client experience can be extremely different, when JS performance differs widely between Firefox, Chrome, Safari and IE <i>versions</i>. Not to mention not everybody supporting the history state API.<p>4) JS performance for long running pages can also vary, due to memory management.<p><i>and it can't be close to as flexible (you don't have a model of state on the client to perform logic with)</i><p>And on the client you don't have a model of the server (where the actual data are and where the actual actions are performed) to perform logic with.",1329541217

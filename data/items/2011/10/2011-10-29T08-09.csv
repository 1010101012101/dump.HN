3171525,comment,3166335,3170542,1,0,gjm11,,,"At least one of us is very confused.<p>In a free market, of course one <i>can</i> get wealthy by growing the pie. But one <i>can</i> also get wealthy without growing the pie, even when illegal or blatantly unethical actions are not involved.<p>For instance, consider a country with a perfectly free market, in which many of the people enjoy betting on horse races. These bets use a tote system, which means in effect that the odds are set automatically according to how betters are betting (and the owner takes a small cut from every bet, makes a steady profit, and gets rich). There are some professional betting advisors, who watch lots of races and monitor the appearance and performance of the horses. Some of them are very good at evaluating how likely a given horse is to win in a given race. They charge large fees.<p>Clients of a very good betting advisor will win more of their bets; they will, on average, lose less money at the races. They may even gain on average, if the other people betting haven't been well advised. If you bet without such good advice (or equivalent horse-assessing skills of your own) then you will, on average, lose more at the races than if the well-advised people weren't betting. The immediate effect of the betting advisors' work, on average, is simply to transfer money from people who aren't their clients to people who are. (And to themselves.)<p>These betting advisors certainly provide value to their clients. They may, if they're good enough and have many clients who bet a lot, be very handsomely paid and deserve every bit, in the sense that their clients gain more from the advice than they pay for it. But they have added no value at all to the world; they have not grown the pie.<p>If the advisors' advice is very good, they charge very large fees, and extremely cheap credit is not readily available, then someone wealthy can engage a betting advisor and reap a profit at the races that exceeds the advisor's fees, while someone less wealthy can't afford to pay an advisor. This may become an appealing investment activity for the wealthy. Effectively, what the advisors are then doing is to increase the price (for the majority) of betting on the horses, while diverting some of the profits to themselves and their clients. If the effective price increase is too large, no one unadvised will bet any more, the horse-racing business will collapse, and lots of people will be in trouble. (The people who actually organize the races and the betting will probably lower <i>their</i> prices to maximize their profits in the new situation, which will postpone that disaster.) But as long as that doesn't happen, everyone's still reasonably content. Compared with not having the betting advisors: (1) the people who organize the races will take less profit, (2) the betting advisors and their clients will take more profit, (3) ordinary betters will lose more, and (4) the actual results of the horse races will be entirely unaltered. Again, the advisors have not grown the pie; they and their clients gain at the expense of the unadvised betters and the people who organize the races and betting (the latter being the only ones who are actually adding any value in this scenario, by providing an activity that people enjoy more than they pay for it).<p>So, in this hypothetical scenario, betting advisors get wealthy neither by making the pie bigger nor by taking other people's pie, but by arranging for their clients to get more pie while other people get less.<p>(You might feel inclined to draw an analogy with, say, hedge funds in the real world. But the situations are not precisely equivalent, and I am not claiming that they are.)",1319878484

As long as people keep infringing on peoples' property rights, one or the other solution will be proposed.

Are you kidding me!?<p>From Wikipedia:<p><i>Pavlina was a student at University of California, Berkeley in the early nineties. He performed extremely poorly in his studies, because he devoted his time to shoplifting. Pavlina claims he then went on to earn two degrees (computer science and math) from California State University, Northridge in three semesters (also incorporating advanced placement credits for courses he had taken in high school).</i><p>1. He's claiming this and it's never been proven, despite how easy it is to actually prove. If he truly did this and people didn't believe him, he can simply show proof.

Saying ""I'm a programmer"" is saying ""I'm a large, fixed cost."" The question for the businessman is always: what value do you add, and does it exceed your costs?<p>Yes, there's value for an in-house engineering <i>team</i>, but with widely varying skill distributions and unevenly matched compensation. Managers know this, and Patrick's point is that ""I'm a programmer"" is starting off on the wrong foot as it just re-affirms that you are a large, fixed cost, saying nothing about your specific contributions.",1319875444

It's a great niche, the competition is fierce but utterly rubbish; there are results in the top ten which literally are html tables you're supposed to print out. I know this can be massively improved, and I have a fantastic innovative business model. I just need someone to help me with UI/UX. I don't want it to look like excel!<p>The spreadsheet only allowed one 'how I can return the favour' answer, so I put in 'returned services', but I also have a small budget to use, and if the idea takes off I will give a return on investment, so it's 'all of the above' really. But I thought it was safest to say that in return I can offer my help as a PHP/mySQL/JavaScript programmer or in any other technical capacity. I didn't want to mislead anyone by saying ""I'll pay"" when in reality I don't have a huge budget. FWIW, here's my CV: <a href=""http://www.puremango.co.uk/2009/08/php-cv/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.puremango.co.uk/2009/08/php-cv/</a> so you can get an idea of the kind of things I might be able to help you with.<p>I'd love to hear from you if you're passionate and have ideas about how best to present this app. It would be great to find a co-founder, but we'll see ;)<p>tweet me @user24 or email howard.yeend@gmail.com",1319875373

4642703,comment,4641588,4641931,10,0,ANTSANTS,,,"I think you're grossly misconstruing his point -- that you shouldn't let architectural ideology or a preconceived notion of what the best solution to your problem is get in the way of shipping good software.<p>The Hurd project had an important problem to solve -- there was all this nice free software for people, but they needed a kernel to run it on or they wouldn't have a complete free operating system.. Their #1, overarching priority should have been to deliver a stable, fast kernel to users, no matter what design it eventually ended up with. However, the project placed too much emphasis on the buzzword of the day, the microkernel, to the point that it got in the way of the project's most important goals. You almost can't fault the project for drinking the microkernel koolaid in its early days, but it likely became clear very quickly to them that it was going to take a significant amount of time and work to get a usable microkernel running. Rather than do the best thing for the free software movement or the users, scrap the microkernel and try to get a high quality ""monolithic"" kernel out there as fast as possible, the team basically decided to create an inferior product in stubborn attachment to their technological ideology.<p>That's the kicker right there -- like a whole lot of open source software, the Hurd project wasn't really advancing the state of the art; they were doing a free implementation of an existing product. Their attachment to doing a microkernel shouldn't have been as strong as their need to do a good <i>kernel</i>, period, but apparently it was, and they were bulldozed by Linux and the BSDs for it.<p>If you follow the Linux kernel's development, you'll know that the contributors and maintainers take pretty much the opposite of an ideology-oriented approach -- you might even say it's pretty well rooted in the scientific method. The project is willing to try just about anything and let the results speak for themselves. Obviously, even if anyone had wanted to, trying out a microkernel approach at any point past the very early days of Linux would be impossible, but there are numerous other cases of the project trying out multiple approaches or multiple implementations of the same idea, and everyone needing to be willing to see their code thrown out if it didn't measure up.<p>I'd like to think Torvalds can see the value in advancing the state of the art in microkernels for it's own sake -- I find the work being done on the L series of microkernels to be very impressive, though Torvalds may stand by his opinion that ""microkernels are stupid and make a hard problem harder."" Regardless, I think his main message here is not that you shouldn't bother advancing the state of the art or following a different design path for its own sake, but that you shouldn't let yourself get committed to a certain design when your primary goal is to <i>fill a need in the world</i> and any advancing of the state of the art is incidental.",1349988399

To begin with, let's define what you typed 2 + 2 as instructions. The ruby console reads your typed instructions, interprets it, and then acts on the instructions the way you gave it. This step is called evaluation. Instruction when complete are called an expression. If the instructions you have typed are incomplete (for example, if you typed 2 +  and hit enter), this console will show an error message. The instruction you typed, 2 + 2 is an expression. It is important to remember that evaluation of an expression always returns a value. This value is what is shown as result on the console. In this case, 4 was the result of the evaluation.""<p>If someone honestly knows nothing about coding, you've probably just lost them right there.  Questions a beginner would ask:<p>* What is a ""ruby console?""<p>* What instructions?  I typed ""2+2.""<p>* What does ""interprets"" mean?<p>* How can instructions be complete?

4642501,comment,4641970,4641970,33,0,rayiner,,,"Since there appears to be some confusion about what this means, I'll try and shed some light on it.<p>The first thing to understand is this is not an appeal involving the whole case. It's an appeal of the district court's decision to grant Apple a preliminary injunction (""the sales ban""). A preliminary injunction is a legal remedy where the defendant is enjoined (prevented) from engaging in some allegedly harmful conduct before the case is decided on the merits. A judge has the power to grant preliminary injunctions because in some cases, by the time a decision is reached the harm might have already been done. E.g. if you're complaining that some company is illegally dumping nuclear waste onto your property every week, you don't want the dumping to continue while the court decides whether it's legal. In that case, the judge has the discretion to grant you a preliminary injunction, which basically ""freezes the status quo"" pending the resolution of the case. Note a preliminary injunction will often involve some sort of bond requirement, requiring the plaintiff to post bond to compensate the defendant for any losses arising from the injunction in case the defendant wins.<p>The judge has discretion to grant a preliminary injunction, but is supposed to only do it when there would otherwise be ""irreparable harm."" This is what the appeal is about. The court said that the trial judge abused her discretion in granting the preliminary injunction because Apple had not proven irreparable harm. Apple claimed that they would lose market share if shipments were allowed to continue, and that was irreparable harm. What the court said was that unless Apple could prove that there was a ""causal nexus"" between Samsung infringing the patent and people buying Galaxy Nexus phones, there was no irreparable harm because of lost market share. In other words, Apple had to prove that people were buying Galaxy Nexus phones only because of the infringing patent. It wasn't sufficient to prove, for the purposes of evaluating irreparable harm, whether Samsung's infringement simply made the product more attractive than it would otherwise be.<p>Incidentally, the ""abuse of discretion"" language has a very specific meaning. It doesn't mean the judge didn't have the power to grant the injunction. Rather, it means the judge didn't grant the injunction on proper grounds. Generally, appeals courts do not review decisions wholesale (""de novo""). Instead, they give the trial judge a lot of latitude. The amount of latitude depends on the specific type of decision. Decisions that involve ""judgment calls"" about the sufficiency of evidence are given much more latitude than decisions that involve say an interpretation of statutory language. ""Abuse of discretion"" is a standard of reviewing a lower court decision that basically means the lower court decision will stand unless the appeals court decides that it was totally in left field. In this case, the appeals court said that granting the injunction was an abuse of discretion because the judge granted the injunction despite Apple's evidence being wholly insufficient to meet the legal requirements for granting the preliminary injunction. It wasn't just a difference in judgment where the appeals court thought the evidence was insufficient to establish irreparable harm but could see how the trial court thought it was sufficient. If that had been the case, the appeals court would have let the decision stand. Instead, the appeals court could see no way to justify the finding of irreparable harm.",1349985921

From trivial replacements (I/l/1,C/G,i/j,P/R etc.) to 'engine said that there's some character here according to the character segmentation results, but it has no damn clue what character it could be' that's a different look at the same problem.<p>Also, for typed content I see quite a lot of shortcuts. SwiftKey for Android, nice as it is, seems to be too braindead to correct words that _start_ with the wrong character (if I type vharacter, with just one single slip at the start, it fails miserably and looks baaad imho). Assumptions like 'just check adjacent characters on the keyboard (special points for assuming a keyboard layout)' or 'ah, the user is certainly starting the jnput correctly and just might misspress a letter in the middle of a word' are nice models to make the developer's life easier, but they don't work for a good number of cases as well..",1349985603

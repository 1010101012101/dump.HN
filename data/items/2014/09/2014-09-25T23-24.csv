You might be describing something close to science <i>in some ideal</i> but certainly not what it looks like in reality. In reality, we don&#x27;t have perfect experiments or evidence, and scientists have to draw conclusions based on interpretations of data. Like it or not, a lot of human factors come into play there. Even more so when the subjects themselves are human. If you want to rule out everything where there&#x27;s a strong human, non-mechanical element from the world of science, then there&#x27;s very little science going on to talk about.<p>Before we have advancement of theory, we have to have inspired hypothesis, and for that, we need imagination. If it weren&#x27;t so, we wouldn&#x27;t need great minds to propel us forward. While I agree that science promotes confrontation of bias, I don&#x27;t think it serves any useful purpose to pretend that science actually happens in a clean room.",1411689511

I&#x27;m sure my tone will be lost to the cold, hard text of a web page.<p>First off, congratulations on turning your situation around and maintaining your sobriety for 2 years.  I can&#x27;t imagine how much work that must have been.<p>I&#x27;ve never really understood the whole &quot;alcoholic vs. sobriety&quot; thing.  Is it not possible to &quot;learn&quot; to drink less?  I see time and again the idea of being &quot;out of control, unable to stop&quot;.  Why is complete sobriety the only answer?  Can varying levels of control truly not be learned?  Or is the prevailing mindset that it&#x27;s &quot;easier&quot; (while I&#x27;m sure still very difficult) to just go down to zero and maintain that, rather than learn moderation?  I wonder if there are any studies or evidence to back that up, if that&#x27;s the case.<p>Also a question about AA itself, if you&#x27;re ok answering it.  My understanding is that AA is very faith-based (many steps of the 12-step process invoking a deity), and that a big part of it involves opening yourself to God and Jesus to help.  Is that universal, or are there non-religious versions of AA?  I know if I (an atheist) ever got into a situation where I needed something like AA, I would be very uncomfortable with the religious aspects.",1411689342

To give context around this speed, the company announced support for Stellar, a decentralized protocol for sending and receiving money in any pair of currencies, just hours after its announcement. While this was obviously behind a curtain, it speaks volumes about Stripe being regarded as the first choice for these types of adoptions.<p>- Landing key deals<p>Within the span of 4 months, Stripe announced partnerships with Alipay, Twitter, Apple, and most recently Facebook. For a company of 160 employees, and just under five years in age, these are huge wins to add to their gallery.<p>- Developer support and evangelism<p>The company extensively blogs, holds office hours and maintains an active IRC channel to help companies integrate with their services. For a startup looking to gain market share, this is crucial. However, the real challenge lies in their ability to sustain this level of support as the company grows. Another area still largely untapped by Stripe is hackathons. By having mentors on-site and getting their client libraries in the hands of as many budding developers as possible, they can solidify their name as the go-to tool for online payments.",1411688979

I mean this reasonably of course, if your app is a reasonably good fit for Ruby and you&#x27;re familiar with Ruby more power to you. I just don&#x27;t understand companies developing odd domain specific/specialized software in languages and platforms not meant for it and then complaining that it runs too slow.<p>Something I&#x27;m also unsure of is why almost every company these days seems to be choosing Rails to build on. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be that they are just picking the language which has the largest available pool of developers available; from what I&#x27;ve read Ruby as a language was completely obscure until Rails came along, and even now isn&#x27;t used much outside of Rails and the occasional script. Python is really popular and used in many domains ranging from web to scientific computing to interfaces for stuff like Arduinos and has a batteries-included de-facto web framework, Django, so I would imagine there were more Python programmers available, but you see far fewer companies using a Python stack. Java also has lots of battle tested web systems and there is a sea of cheap Java developers(might as well hire a cheap dev if your initial product is going to be a rushed piece of shit), though it is verbose, has a longer dev cycle, and is considered to be for the enterprise type businesses run by Wall Street fat cats everyone is trying to &quot;disrupt&quot;.<p>Is it because Rails is just trendy, or some other reason?",1411688434

Even here in Belgium where employee contracts protect more the employees than the company (at least that&#x27;s the theory), at the starting period, firing can be done very quickly and I think it can be done even more easily in the US.<p>Also I think the best way to see if someone&#x27;s good or bad is to put that person to work. This would e.g. mean that if you have filtered out candidates to 8 persons, you could get the one you prefer to work for 1 week. If your choice was bad, you try the second. In the worst case, you have made a very deep assessment of 8 candidates in two months. I mean that I don&#x27;t understand the point of recruitment processes that take weeks with all kind of proxy metrics for how a candidate would fit in a very small team.<p>If you can&#x27;t find out in a week that the person is bad, how can a recruitment process be better ?<p>Edit: I&#x27;m surprised by how the 1 (paid, in my mind) work week is perceived in the (so far) 3 answers below. It happens all the time to have phone interviews, HR interviews, technical interviews, possibly pseudo-psychological tests, and technical tests in a recruitment process. All that time without being paid (sometimes well before you know what the salary could be). It&#x27;s all about trade-off, I&#x27;m not talking about ditching the selection process and instead hire-and-fire liberally.

If it did, the quotient would be a &quot;magic number&quot;.<p>However, 7 does divide 2^33 - 1. This &quot;magic number&quot; <i>does</i> fit in a 32 bit word. It&#x27;s just that division by 2^33 - 1 isn&#x27;t as trivial as division by 2^32 +/- 1 (it&#x27;s not much worse though).<p>Multiplication by/storage of a 33 bit number also isn&#x27;t a problem anyway, because you can use the &quot;IEEE trick&quot; of storing the leading 1 bit implicitly. Multiplication by such a number can be done with one multiply and one addition. Not that you actually need to do this for the divisor 7.<p>The original Montgomery-Granlund work (apparently the basis of GCC division by invariant integers for quite a while) was to always find a quasi-&quot;magic number&quot; which fits in a word. So that was definitely not the innovation of Fish.<p>The followup paper of Moller-Granlund does even better by using a mullow instead of a full mul or mulhigh, which is usually available sooner on modern processors.<p>Fish seem to have found some highly optimised sequences. I&#x27;m not entirely clear on how new the ideas themselves are. It&#x27;s clearly not the same as Montgomery-Granlund, but Montgomery-Granlund use (B^2 - 1)/d (where admittedly d has to be first &quot;normalised&quot;), Fish uses (2^p*B)/d where they fiddle the dividend and do some post-shifting.<p>I&#x27;m not even sure if Fish is better than Moller-Granlund, though the latter was 2009, not 1994.<p>I don&#x27;t want to take away from the contribution of Fish.

You should just trust your instincts on this. Older people have to basically guess about the technologies...that young people are using. Because young people get older and become the dominant market. But you can just watch what you&#x27;re doing and what your friends are doing and you will almost certainly have better instincts on fast-growing markets than anybody older than you.&quot;<p>Vivek Wadhwa conducted a fairly large study[1] on successful technology company founders and discovered that the median age when they started their companies was close to 40. This seems to be in direct conflict with Altman&#x27;s statements, so I wonder what statistics he has to back them up.<p>Also, for all the talk about fast-growing markets and building huge companies, it&#x27;s somewhat useful to look at who is actually making money and how much. In 2009, just 3% of all taxpayers who earned $1 million or more were under the age of 35 and of those reporting more than $10 million in adjusted gross income, only 409 were under 35[2]. Since a significant percentage of million dollar-plus earners are self-employed business owners, a lot of old farts running businesses are doing something right even if, according to Sam Altman, they have a harder time spotting fast-growing markets.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-innovations/the-case-for-old-entrepreneurs/2011/12/02/gIQAulJ3KO_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-innovations/the-ca...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://taxfoundation.org/article/who-are-americas-millionaires"" rel=""nofollow"">http://taxfoundation.org/article/who-are-americas-millionair...</a>",1411687515

8003897,comment,8001400,8001400,2,0,Liesmith,,,"It is interesting how Social Services is vilified here, but her own organization&#x27;s failure to help everyone is obviously because they lack the resources. This person&#x27;s loathing for Social Services let her get through the day, provided an enemy to fight, but completely prevented her from getting any insight into the problems that they face and the reasons they are forced to make so many denials. She offers an explanation (they like denying people things) but even she seems aware how ludicrous that is.<p>Meanwhile in just a few months of dealing with the needy and not having the ability to help them all she is ground down into bitterness and cynicism. I think the subtext here points to much better reasons for the Social Services people giving her a hard time. She&#x27;s just some dilettante college chick doing some good works before going off to her real career. The people who she&#x27;s railing against do this for a living, and don&#x27;t run away after a year. They&#x27;ve been working at this for their entire careers, and see people like her every day.",1404817152

If XML is invalid but still makes sense, you treat it as valid, because if you don&#x27;t, your competitors will.<p>If this is a business requirement you would do the same for JSON.<p>> If you don&#x27;t think somebody would throw invalid XML at your app and not expect it to work then you&#x27;ve clearly never worked with XML seriously.<p>Nope, if you have a customer sending you an XML which should validate against a predefined schema, no, hell no. \nI&#x27;ve worked for the European office of publications, and the web services were just receiving tons of XML on a daily basis. And you know what, invalid XML were rejected that&#x27;s as simple as that. If you don&#x27;t respect the supplied schema, retry when correct.<p>> docbook IS XML.<p>Docbook USES XML.<p>Last but not least, HTML is not XML, HTML is not a subset of XML. Permissiveness has nothing to do with web services acceptance of invalid schemas.<p>If you call a Google service whether it uses SOAP (so XML) or REST, if the request body is invalid, you&#x27;ll be rejected either way. The SOAP one won&#x27;t try to parse more or resolve issues just because it is XML based.",1404817073

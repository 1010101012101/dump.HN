235951,comment,235390,235899,0,0,huhtenberg,,,"> <i>But C doesn't have any mechanism other than exiting or returning a value that indicates ""false"".</i><p>Of course it does, in fact you just said it yourself - long jumps. Back in late 90s I worked with the firmware for the Point of Sale terminals, PIN pads, etc. It was written in C and its error handling was exception-based. Behind the scenes it was just a handful of long/setjmp wrappers, but it did nevertheless implement semantics of try/catch/etc.<p>Additionally, ""exiting or returning false"" are not the only two options, nor they even the most commonly used ones. At least in the projects that I was exposed to. Kernel code (e.g. Linux, BSD) routinely uses int as a return value and it still somehow manages to be both readable and functional without being ""bloated"" or using ""weird API"".<p>Yet another thing to consider is that optional exceptions (such as those in C++) come with a non-negligible performance hit, so it is considered an absolute no-no to use them in a ""fast path"" parts of the code.<p>> <i>But I do think that C should be dying off now</i><p>But it just doesn't. Bummer :)",1215147384

The time spent making software compatible across platforms is way more expensive than the money you gain from selling on that platform.<p>For example, I have some shareware I sell. Brings me about $3000 a month. When I took Windows 2000 off the list, revenues dropped to about $2700 a month. However, about 50% of support requests could now be replied with ""Platform not supported"" because I could finally use new APIs that were only available on XP.<p>Your idealistic dreamy eyed attitude will be tempered by experience at some point.",1215147062

If so, does the load from one customer's server instance negatively effect all of the others on the same hardware? I understand that you can instantly spool up additional servers to dynamically handle load, but do those individual instances suffer from performance issues if they're loaded on busy hardware?",1215146605
235938,comment,235925,235925,0,0,jeremytliles,,,"I think hosting cost is the biggest issue, especially if you reach a point where you need to balance load across many servers. There is also the cost ofthe development tools, although I think MS has some programs that allow you to get Visual Studio .NET for free or for minimal cost. Other than that, I think there is just a huge bias against the MS stack in the ""hacker"" (yes, ironic quotes) community. Having worked with asp.net, django/python and rails, I honestly don't see a huge difference between the three in terms of development productivity, but there is definitely a difference in hosting and software licensing costs. Because of that, I've lately been choosing not to lock myself in to the MS stack for any projects that have the potential to require massive scaling.",1215146398

(DIV-enclosed PREs are clipped the same in FF2 and FF3; TABLE-enclosed PREs are clipped in FF2 but grow the page in FF3.)<p>So my long-term suggestion: drop TABLES, move to DIV-based layout. (This might be a simple change in the ARC HTML-writing code.) In the meantime, add the 'max-width' to the PRE rule to minimize the annoyance in FF3/etc.",1215145390

We want it on-demand online, with comments and minimal advertising.  You can sue whoever you want, it's not going to make anyone change the way they think.

They play it several dB louder than the program, so you have to constantly play with the volume (I just muted it).  Then, you pay $60/month to get it into your house!  Why are they surprised that people are going elsewhere for the content?  Who want to pay $25/month to watch advertisements!?<p>Anyway, this lawsuit shows that they are slowly dying.  Google's data won't help them with anything other than ""hey, people like our content, but yet they won't watch the ads!""

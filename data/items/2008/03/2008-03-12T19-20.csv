I think founders who have been busting their asses to get this product up-and-running deserve some sort of bonus, especially because they just presumably diluted their equity.  Maybe this could be solved with some sort of one-time bonus or at least a big effin' party of some sort.",1205351952

135432,comment,135166,135362,0,0,wheels,,,"STL does blow.  Templates are fine if used sparingly (i.e. non-STL container classes).  Virtuals shouldn't be optional (a la Java).  I'd add to the list that references in C++ are silliness (const reference usage should be a detail handled by the compiler automatically, non-const references just lead to ambiguous APIs).<p>The problem really seems to be that there are still some niches where you need something with relatively fine grained control and raw horsepower of C++, but there's not been anything to come along to fill that niche.<p>A simplified C++ standard would be a step in the right direction.  Unfortunately it seems that the standard is moving in the opposite direction.<p>For what it's worth, I find programming with Qt pretty close to ""C++ as it should be"".",1205351608

135430,comment,135166,135166,0,0,scott_s,,,"C++ is a systems programming language first, and an application programming language second. There was a time when there was little difference between the two areas.<p>System resources are not as precious as they used to be, so the distinction has become more apparent. Hence, people who use C++ for non-systems programming encounter friction when performance goals are at odds with productivity goals. They then move to languages which take the opposite approach and sacrifice performance for productivity.<p>I use and like using C++. Yet I don't see any reason to argue when he says C++ is not for him any longer - he's probably right. I think the domain where C++ is appropriate has shrunk and continue to do so, and that's fine.<p>(For the record, rvalue references are a means to eliminate copying objects. This is, indeed, a performance optimization that most people don't care about.)",1205351603

135417,comment,135238,135238,0,0,OpenWebU,,,"also, i'd like to comment is that you are doing 'market analysis' third-hand -- the products that companies offer are a combination of their opinion of what the markets need, and their own response to customers.<p>IMHO, true market analysis is going to the real end-customer (the customers of the hosting vendor).  If it is obvious what the very they need and what they are willing to pay for, then no need to do this.  But let's say as an example, the true end-customers are large IT departments.  I'd look around and find someone in that IT department to interview and find them across industries, and see what they are willing to buy. Often these customers are listed as references on their website.",1205350799

135400,comment,135275,135376,0,0,wheels,,,"Sure.  A lot of stuff is structured and some standardization may happen there.  But let's say that somebody posts a really good comment here that becomes an authoritative source on something or another.  You're not going to get the sort of fine-grained meta data that the semantic web expects.  Titles are boring.  We can get that from HTML already.  And web search got a lot better when that and a lot of other structural metadata started being almost wholesale ignored.<p>Where I could see the semantic web catching on would be in things like Amazon shops or something, where it was advantageous to be able to provide a homogenous interface to a given set of structured data.  On the other hand, it wouldn't be in Amazon's interest for that to be the case, because for them the world works better when they get to define the rules and the API and it doesn't easily transfer to another store.",1205349809

Series A investors will likely allow small raises so that you're not living off ramen anymore, but founders should still expect to be paid below market rate.<p>My guess is that compensation would be a topic of board discussion -- especially executive compensation.  In an early stage company, it would be politically impossible to argue that you should be paid more simply so that you don't jump ship.  Threatening to quit does NOT go over well with investors.<p>It's pretty common that early employees and non-founder executives are paid more than the founders.  Obviously, the founders will own considerably more stock.",1205349800

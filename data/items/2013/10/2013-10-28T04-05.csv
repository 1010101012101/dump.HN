6625243,comment,6624944,6624944,8,0,detcader,,,"The unfortunate question that keeps coming up in my head: does Glenn expect all the journalists of this new enterprise to be as good as him? If you look at his past articles, going back years before the Snowden leaks, he is clearly fluent in what he does. Being a former lawyer accounts for a good part of it. For example he never descends into &quot;liberal vs conservative&quot; &quot;left vs right&quot; semantics. He recognizes that these meaningless labels hinder discourse (even in this exchange, Keller tries to bait him into it, but Glenn doesn&#x27;t budge). It also seems as if he has some kind of bank (a personal wiki? I must know!) of links to past articles and sources that he can pull from and sprinkle over his claims, a practice that makes for amazingly solid articles.<p>Like another user said, I&#x27;ve been reading most everything he writes and tweets -- starting months before the Snowden leaks. I just trust that they&#x27;re relevant to me as a US citizen 99% of the time. Few journalists are worthy of such trust.",1382936346

But even if the OP had spent twice the amount (still <$100!), they would still be delivering the same message.<p>What&#x27;s more important - and this is the OP&#x27;s argument, and which I am supporting - is that his Odesk experience was positive because of the time saved, i.e. the &quot;Ship Shit Quickly Principle&quot;. The cost difference for finding an equivalent logo (say, -$20 or -$30) is minimal compared to the opportunity cost of spending time searching for such a logo. Instead, the logo &quot;does the job&quot; - it&#x27;s not perfect (or even good), but it presents a fun, memorable brand and getting it done quickly (which is what Odesk allowed him to do) allows OP to focus on the other important facets of their startup (which hasn&#x27;t even launched yet).<p>Of course, <i>I</i> might have the &#x27;bigger picture&#x27; wrong or even share a flawed view with the OP.

6625171,comment,6624860,6624860,49,0,SwellJoe,,,"I didn&#x27;t need to read this article to know why. I watched it happen.<p>My first company sold web caching proxy hardware and software support (all Open Source based on Squid). 95% of my customers for the first several years of operation were independent ISPs. I had maybe 200 of them as customers in the 7 years the company existed, many became friends. When &quot;deregulation&quot; took place in the telephone, cable, and broadband market...at the beginning of the DSL/cable Internet revolution, the last mile became impossible to bridge for ISPs without an agreement with either a telco or cable operator (before that modems could call across the country without any explicit involvement of the telco...though higher speed modems did require data center presence at the telco level). The government required telcos and cable operators to resell the last mile to independent service providers at a fair rate; they were supposed to charge the same thing it cost them to provide the service to their own broadband divisions.<p>So, independent ISPs were offered a DSL link to their customer for, say, $23.50 per month, which is what the telco says it costs them to build/maintain that DSL link and make a modest profit. Great, right? Problem is, whenever ISPs tried to setup a DSL link, the telco would drag their feet. They would take months to deploy service for an independent, or claim they didn&#x27;t have the hardware in place for that customer, or screw up the installation several times. But, that was just the beginning. The telcos would <i>also</i> send out mailers to those very same customers, offering DSL internet at special introductory prices...$19.95/month, for instance. Yeah, cheaper than the base cost for the line they&#x27;re charging independents (which doesn&#x27;t include all the other stuff an ISP has to provide). And, despite having told those customers they couldn&#x27;t get DSL or having experienced months of delays, the moment the customer called up the telco, DSL would be up and running within a couple of days.<p>I&#x27;d been hearing about it from my customers, and then I had it happen to me. I tried two different independents...they worked hard to get me service, and finally gave up, apologizing for the inability to deliver. After 6 months of delays, I received one of those mailers from the telco. I called the telco, and had DSL a few days later. Same circuit they&#x27;d refused to install service on as recently as a month before.<p>When I started my first company, there were thousands of independent ISPs. Some of them were <i>really</i> good. Some of them were <i>really</i> successful. Most of them died during the switch to broadband. It wasn&#x27;t an accident. They were killed off by the old monopolies, and our regulators were complicit in the process.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing for more regulation, really, but when the only way to get to your customer is through a state-enforced monopoly, the state better do their damned job. Or, we end up with the mess we have today: Among the worst Internet service at the highest prices in the modern world. How is that allowed to happen in the nation that invented the Internet?<p>All the arguments about distance and density are moot when talking about major cities; San Francisco is very dense. There&#x27;s not reason for broadband to cost $99 for reasonable speeds, when it costs a third that for more bandwidth in a couple dozen other nations, including places that are less dense.<p>This process didn&#x27;t kill my company directly (I was able to pivot successfully to serving enterprise, education, and government customers, and I had my best year the last year it was in operation), but it made it so un-fun that I didn&#x27;t want to do it anymore. The kind of people I wanted to work with were no longer in the business. The smart ones sold out to bigger companies, the stubborn ones clung desperately to their dialup business or spent all their money trying to go to WiMax and bypass the telcos. Almost none of them survived as independent ISPs.<p>Some of the bigger ones brought lawsuits against the telcos. I don&#x27;t know what became of them, but the companies that did it are mostly gone, so I guess we know how it turned out.",1382935172

The purpose of inflation in this context is to &quot;kill the debt&quot;, because the US cannot pay out $17T or even maintain interest payments, with &quot;non-inflated&quot; dollars. That is why all of this is just hand-waving and subversive, mis-directing PR.<p>The reason Japan is such a bad example is precisely inflation. But its death-nell was asset inflation, not cpi. Housing stocks and Bank loans were massively overinflated and never allowed to correct. The notion that this &quot;inflation&quot; should have been corrected with &quot;other inflation&quot; is one of those laughable bits of rediculousness.<p>Likewise, the US in a funk caused by Asset inflation. Fighting it with price inflation will be interesting. Take a look at the London property market. Do you think raising the price of consumer goods will help? Wont people just be encouraged to park their cash in property (ie, real goods?). Right now, they are trying to &quot;make housing more affordable&quot; by interest rate subsidies (inflationary). Doesn&#x27;t seem to be making anything more affordable, though.",1382933185

It also assumes that the interest rate on their debt doesn&#x27;t go up as inflation rises, which it certainly can (e.g., for credit card debt and variable rate mortgages).<p>For investments, it depends on the type of investment. For example, if you own bonds, the interest rate is paid based on the purchase price of the bond in pre-inflation dollars, and the higher the rate of inflation, the less your interest payments will be  worth. By the time the bond matures, the amount you may have gotten back in principal and interest may be less in real dollars than what you paid for it (and you&#x27;ll still need to pay taxes on the interest). Same for savings accounts: if they don&#x27;t pay an interest rate that&#x27;s above inflation, you&#x27;ll be losing real dollars after inflation and taxes.",1382932940

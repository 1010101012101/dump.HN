757407,story,,,3,0,abalashov,"Ask HN: Does changing locales to fix productivity doldrums work for you?",,"The article about the creative bliss of moving to an attractive, cheaper foreign environment to bootstrap a startup:<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=756570<p>... got me thinking on a somewhat tangential question:  Does moving around to change your environment actually help you work?  Or is it solving the wrong problem the wrong way?<p>From a personal state-of-mind angle that the author is pushing, I guess I'm not entirely sold on the fact that a change of scenery will let a hundred flowers of creativity bloom - in a sustainable way - to an extent that confers upon a startup a meaningful economic advantage. The cost differences might, but I'm not so sure about the aesthetic/spiritual quality.<p>I've moved around a lot in my 23 years. I emigrated from Russia with my parents when I was 6, and moved around the US several times during childhood. Within the last few years spent in Georgia, I've moved several times within the general area I inhabited, including twice within Atlanta. When I was young, I was always eager to move every time it happened; my idealism allowed me to fantasise that was an opportunity for self-reinvention, for casting away whatever I didn't like about the incumbency of my life, for new social possibilities - basically, for leading a more awesome and enjoyable life.<p>Every single time, I was disappointed once the novelty wore off after a week or two. It seems to me that changes of scenery and ambiance are mostly very superficial. The fundamental, more existential qualities of one's mind and character persist, and certainly, characteristic problems and limitations as well. I am majorly disenchanted with the ""grass is greener"" syndrome that led me to embrace the novelty of moving, believing that it's going to be significantly transformative. I've told myself one too many times that the reason I procrastinate or feel unmotivated/uninspired or fatigued is because some sort of cultural blight or cosmological ennui is a feature of the environment of my particular locale, and if I just move to this awesome new place way over there, everything's going to be different and I'm going to be a new person. That's never worked for me.<p>I'm not saying environment isn't economically important. I think it's pretty uncontroversial that some environments are objectively better places to start a technology venture and just do technical work than others, based on the availability of investment capital, infrastructure, communities of likeminded people, the overall educational and cultural level of the general population, etc. I'd be the last to argue.<p>But I don't think that moving to my own personal resort in a foreign country is going to let me find the Tao, and it's hard for me to imagine how that could be true of anyone else, either. I just haven't seen any evidence that my productivity is going to be exponentially more fruitful if only I just had the right mountains or trees or ocean or cityscape around me. I've had that misconception in the past, and I've watched it crash and burn over and over. Instead, my finding has consistently been that if I really want to work on something, I'll work on it in all but the most inhospitable environment, and if I don't, I can't make myself do it even if I totally tricked out and accessorised my aesthetic.<p>I've been in ""the zone"" and written some great code in noisy coffee shops on a small, old, slow laptop, and I've spent entire weeks getting nothing substantial done on my awesome new PC with dual 22"" panels, untold gigabytes of RAM and the most ergonomic peripherals, desk and chair.<p>Bottom line - if I'm really passionate about something, I'll code it on a rooftop in North Dakota while it's snowing. And if I'm really in a funk, no amount of beach, pastoral quiet or enchanting landscape is going to get me out of it. I would think most other people work the same way, even though they may not realise it. I think trying to fix it by changing the environment is a terrible delusion, not altogether different from changing one's interior decor around in pursuit of perfect occupational bliss.  Some environments and setups are definitely more conducive to productivity than others for fairly objective reasons, but beyond that, the effect seems negligible.<p>What about you?  Are you an artist that needs a ""perfect studio?""",1250056388

The lack of economic survival alternatives isn't the only thing that's keeping people at jobs that pay higher than subsistence wages.<p>So, it sounds like the following things would happen, among others -- good or bad.  Am I completely off track here?<p>- For people who are indigent, homeless and/or completely unemployed, this would be a big help.  However, it would also disincentivise taking any very low-wage job that pays comparably, as long as people who have 'moved up' by virtue of receiving basic income are content with that level of lifestyle.<p>- That would strip a great, great many service industries in this country - i.e. most fast food, a lot of retail - of their present sources of cheap unskilled labour, requiring them to pay a premium above Basic Income and thus drive up costs for them and everyone that consumes their products and services.  It would also greatly injure the competitive position of those firms relative to foreign competitors that do not have a Basic Income requirement.  Although the requirement to pay higher wages when operating in the US for those foreign competitors would mitigate that _somewhat_, it would still be a very, very significant competitive distortion that could affect their ability to expand into other markets vs. foreign competitors, etc.<p>- Other aspects of having to ""compete"" with Basic Income would create similar distortions elsewhere.  It's effectively the same as raising minimum wage significantly;  it would encourage more aggressive export of jobs out of the country, where Basic Income does not create a high compensation bar.<p>- For anyone making substantively above a Basic Income-level salary, it would just add $BASIC_INCOME to their salary, contributing to significant inflation and making just about everything less affordable to people who <i>only</i> receive Basic Income.<p>- There would be constant disagreement as to just what constitutes Basic Income and how much is really needed to subsist.  There's not a lot of consensus as to just what exactly ""subsistence"" entails.  Poor people in America (somewhat understandably) have a standard of ""subsistence"" that poor people in Third World countries could only aspire to.",1250053896

MPG comparisons are based on two vehicles using the same amount of gas and seeing which will go farther, which clearly isn't how people think. Gal/100mi are based on cars driving the same distance and seeing which uses less gas, which is more applicable to real habits.<p>There's also an interesting study done by some guys at Duke (summarized at <a href=""http://bit.ly/mYpFV"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/mYpFV</a>) showing how GPM makes it much easier for people to grasp fuel savings than MPG does. Let's say I have two cars, each of which is driven 10K miles per year - not unreasonable for a suburban household. One of my cars gets 35MPG, and one gets 20MPG. I can replace the former with a 50MPG car, or the latter with a 30MPG - for differences of 15 and 10MPG respectively. most people would pick the former.<p>But in that case, the 15MPG increase would only save 85gal, whereas the 10MPG increase would save 160gal. If you flip the numbers, however, and consider the choices as Gallons per 100mi, it becomes much clearer:<p><pre><code>  MPG    Gal/100mi  Savings (gal/100mi)   Savings (MPG)
  
  35     2.85
  50     2.00       0.85 gal/100mi        15
  
  20     5.00
  30     3.33       1.66 gal/100mi        10
</code></pre>
The 20 -> 30MPG switch is empirically a better deal, all else equal (since we don't expect our driving habits to change with the new car). Gal/100mi sure makes it easier to see that, though.",1250053281

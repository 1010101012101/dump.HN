4630487,comment,4630086,4630295,7,0,WildUtah,,,"<i>Clearly ADHD medications work, which is wonderful. But why do we need to label people with a ""disorder"" in order to give them the meds?</i><p>The drug war paranoia makes it necessary. So does the bureaucratic system that allows only people with an official diagnosis to obtain any kind of medication, even mood modifiers that are inherently subtle and personal.<p>Well, it doesn't prohibit all kinds of medication. Lots of people who are using adderall (also known as amphetamines, benzedrine, or dexedrine -- a popular self-administered medicine until the 1970s) and the like would be using truly dangerous tobacco and liquor if amphetamines were not available.<p>It's not about insurance. The pills themselves are very cheap to make and most formulations are not under patent.<p>As long as we need to put people in jail for using these substances, we're going to need a way to mark whose use is legitimate and whose isn't. Measuring who has health insurance and a good stable relationship with a doctor is a good way to tell whom to imprison and whom not to.<p>Methamphetamine incidentally is different from adderall only by a single methyl moiety and has almost indistinguishable clinical effect in matched doses, though meth has longer lasting side effects due to the hydrophobic methyl group allowing the medicine to persist longer in fatty tissues.",1349769534

4630471,comment,4626201,4626201,7,0,fdr,,,"In the class of programmer given as an example, I think a lot of the answer is some amount of self promotion.  This is not meant in a derogatory way: it is true some people self promote to the exclusion of doing something actually interesting, but there are a number of programmers who are very, <i>very</i> good whose names are known by very few, and the biggest difference I can see is self promotion.  Self promotion can take the form of writing useful, thought provoking articles, so it is not in and of itself counter-productive.<p>Here's one of the programmers I respect most who I will guess only a few here have ever heard of who falls into this category:<p><pre><code>  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Lane_(computer_scientist)\n</code></pre>\nI heard of him because of a PostgreSQL committer I had the privilege of working with briefly, Neil Conway, who described him in glowing language that left an impression on me.  However, his achievements far outstrip his strong part in the stewardship of PostgreSQL: if you have seen a TIFF, JPEG, or a PNG, you may also have some thanks to give to him.  Especially mind-boggling is his contribution as measured by a study in 2000[0].  I can't comment as to the details of its methodology, but anyone who manages to show up in the top ten, nestled among entire organizations (FSF, Sun, University of California, and above MIT) is, to me, already someone deserving of a legend, or two.  So are probably the other individuals mentioned there...who, unfortunately, I have never heard of: Gordon Matzigkeit, and Paul Houle.  I have, like many people, heard of Ulrich Drepper, who appears on this list, and the tidings I hear are not entirely positive.  But we know what is said about publicity...<p>Since that conversation with Neil some years ago, I have interacted with Tom and read his mailings on the postgresql mailing lists a number of times.  There, you see him dealing with all the usual bullshit everyone has to put up with in real time: toolchain regressions, build farm issues, niggles in two features that interact badly, and so on.  Besides that, the quality and care in even the first draft of his features are also remarkable.<p>Unlike some famous programmers who -- while very competent -- can be very contrarian in their work (and invite controversy, which is some form of self-promotion), Tom is not as such, and I think provides a great counter-point to that style of distinguishment.<p>I think it'd be fascinating for someone who has the skill to interview him about his long and productive service to writing useful software.  If I have to guess on his behalf, here's what I can assess about Tom:<p>* Work on important problems<p>* Work on them for a long time each<p>* ...but not necessarily forever<p>* Build the software to last<p>* Keep working<p>[0]: <a href=""http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/769/678"" rel=""nofollow"">http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/ar...</a>",1349769069

JS does not support a formal separation between the 'attributes' and 'keys' of a hash, so it's a security risk waiting to happen.<p>In some cases the JS approach is very nice and useful: in Python you see gobs and gobs of classes used to hold data structures, mostly because people don't seem to like dicts in general. I remember a talk, but not the speaker or title of it, where it was pointed out that your Python class is probably a dict plus a function if it has exactly two methods, one of which is called __init__. Python being what it is, you may also extend Python to do what JS does, but slightly more intelligently:<p><pre><code>    class obj(dict):\n        def __init__(self, vals={}):\n            for key in vals:\n                self[key] = vals[key]\n        def __setattr__(self, name, value):\n            self[name] = value\n        def __getattribute__(self, name):\n            try:\n                return dict.__getattribute__(self, name)\n            except AttributeError:\n                if name in self:\n                    return self[name]\n                else:\n                    raise AttributeError(""'obj' has no key '%s'"" % name)\n</code></pre>\nThis lets you use dotted setters/getters with Python without accidentally having x['keys'] = 1 override the obj.keys() method (which it inherits from dict). It's a serious problem in real Python code I've read and written; you create 'classes' which are only instantiated once (and are therefore semantically dicts). So the JS model really has some advantages for easy, clear namespacing (and packaging and enumeration) of identifiers, but yes, there is a potential security question if you allow people to set or get arbitrary JS attributes.",1349768051

But we don't ask gays to be straight, despite not being ""normal"", numerically, so why should we ask Aspies to be more empathetic? Why assume an Aspie is broken, by default? Where's the proof that lack of empathy is a problem for anything <i>other</i> than working with neurotypicals?<p>I can't help but wonder that the future might not actually belong to neurotypicals. That, perhaps, the Aspie mutation might be better adapted to a world that is becoming more and more computerized and less and less hospitable to neurotypicals.<p>For example, consider Zynga. How many normals are completely <i>wasting their lives and earnings</i> on an objectively stupid social game because their normal, empathetic minds have been hacked to ""like"" and see value in it? We all can see that it's sad, and yet we know there's virtually nothing that can be done for them, short of banning those games. They simply cannot adapt, where Aspies can (and have).<p>Neurotypicals seem to think Aspies have ""anti-social"" lives, but those I've met seem pretty happy. And at least from my perspective, are really straightforward to get along with, if you can understand their behavior and not take offense and what would normally be a slight in neurotypical-land.<p>Perhaps trying to turn Aspies into neurotypicals is really only beneficial today because most of the world is normal, so Aspies, to some degree, need to work with neurotypicals if they are to achieve anything.<p>But how long will that be true? When will a critical mass of Aspies exist, or the world become hospitable to them <i>despite</i> not having to pretend to be neurotypicals?<p>And what then? Do we continue to try and ""make the gays straight"", so to speak? Or do we realize that an Aspie is just as valid a way to live as anything else, and not a disability to be overcome?<p>It's strange to see evolution happen right in front of us.

Who earns them really does not play into it.<p>While the double taxation argument seems to be popular, it is relatively weak. Some of the important reasons that are often overlooked:<p>- Long-term capital gains are not indexed for inflation. For investments held multiple years, this compounds into a very substantial loss that cannot be deducted from the nominal paper gain. You can pay significant capital taxes for a real loss. For short-term investments and income, this loss is nominal and can easily be accounted for in other ways. The lower tax rate on long-term capital returns is a simple way to approximately account for that loss without complicated math.<p>- Long-term capital taxes are not efficient relative to other taxes. Taxes adversely impact the economy from which tax revenue is derived, so preference is given to taxes that have the least negative impact for every dollar collected. In this regard, capital taxes are among the least efficient of the common taxes. By comparison, both income and consumption taxes do much less damage to economic growth for the amount of revenue generated. From the standpoint of maximizing tax revenue, taxing long-term capital investments is not a good way of going about it.<p>In short, long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate because (1) you can't deduct the substantial inflation losses which make long-term investments otherwise unattractive and (2) even if you could, it is a lousy way for governments to generate tax revenue over the long term relative to other tax sources. While they are associated with high earners, that is mostly incidental. Governments generally have a vested interest in balancing growing the tax base and maximizing revenue, arbitrary notions of fairness aside.",1349766348

Typescript is to me the most exciting thing to have happened to JS, better than all the so called libraries that have to be declared inside a function (!!) so that the scope doesn't get completely screwed up.<p>The JS community is not an argument for JS I feel, because it does not have a track record of providing reliable software. Most libraries are new and a lot of devs are very lax with security or code robustness. If you use a library/tool you're not sure what you're getting - see the semicolon situation or the npm directory deletion.",1349766291

When your messages are rejected, you monotonically lose money until you can message again. For this reason, I highly doubt anyone is sending an uncontrolled amount of messages to any exchange on purpose because surpassing messaging constraints is unprofitable, which would violate everyone's primary motive.<p>The orders not meant to be hit is a separate issue from the messaging. These orders are there because of<p>1) quoting requirements designed to mitigate volatility,<p>2) to give traders the feeling of depth (illusory or not) because market participants tend to interact with exchanges that look like they have thicker books,<p>3) to gain queue spot due to any FIFO component of the exchange's matching algorithm in case the price moves to the level where these orders could get executed,<p>4) to gain order allocation due to any pro rata component of the exchange's matching algorithm.<p>All of these reasons are controlled by the exchange and to some extent the SEC. The first 2 reasons are the result of the exchange trying to make money by attracting participants. The last 2 reasons are the result of participants rationally reacting to their incentives as dictated by the matching algorithms designed by the exchange.",1349766255

The tutorial makes use of overloading operators new and delete which (both operators and overloading feature) are only available in C++.<p>I think the title is misleading; as far as I know, term ""C/C++"" is a blanket and should be avoided.",1218628560

They knew VBA obviously, but that was it (the app was C++ on Solaris). But they knew the foreign exchange business inside out, and ""sales"" consisted of them having lunch with their mates (which BTW bagged us 7 of the top 10 FX banks as clients.... no programmer could have done that).",1218625955

It also upped my top speed, allowing me to swim with the better swimmers without getting in their way, also adding to the enjoyment.<p>A lot of swimmers do interval training too - eg 20 by 4 lengths every X minutes (with X including some rest time) - as you get better you drop the minutes to give yourself less rest and can up the number of intervals too.<p>I guess its all down to enjoyment to swim more efficiently, as you counter the energy savings by going faster and longer ... Its like the pleasure you get from programming in a language you are expert in vs the one your just learning (which is rather frustrating until you get good at it and don't need the manual every two minutes!).",1218625852

The problem with this scheme is that we lose all that juicy parse-ability and addressability that make the internet so useful and powerful.<p>Let's face it: the open web is a terrible environment to program in. It is messy and arcane and difficult. But some of this difficulty is <i>not</i> acidental complexity. Some of it is the price we pay for writing apps who's outputs and interfaces are themselves addressable, mutable, and usable.<p>If apps were to become big opaque blobs of binaries again, yes, they would be easier to program. But is that good for us, or good for the world? What is the long-term cost of making the web?<p>The promise of real, globally shared coding environments is only just starting to get some legs with tools like jsfiddle revolutionizing the way we solve programming problems together. I <i>can't</i> really share Java code of any complexity with people and be assured that they will be run in a suitable context. The path to creating an environment, compiling and executing Java is intense, and jsFiddle literally <i>eliminates all of that work for the people I want to see my code</i>. Learning the quirks of the open web is a small price to pay for that super-power.<p>And let me also say that there is still plenty of accidental complexity to eliminate! In particular, servers have been doing far too much for far too long, and once they start doing what they are good at and <i>only</i> what they are good at (which is partitioning the sum total of your information into discrete URL-addressable resources) we will all breath a huge sigh of relieve, and focus on the real problem.

I did a co-op (basically interning every other semester with the same company) to get work experience.<p>I didn't have any open source contributions, nor did some of my friends. I know some of my friends launched websites and start ups for experience, and that worked for them to get jobs. I don't have enough anecdotal data to tell you one way is better than the other, it's really your choice on how to get recognized, and what to get recognized for.<p>HN more than most will probably tell you not to go to college. If you want to join a big company, you'll need the college degree eventually. Depending on the company, they'll let you in on the ground floor, and perhaps pay for it, which a perk for you. Or you can work while you study to earn money to pay for school so you don't graduate with heavy debt. In any case, I saw some great advise here regarding colleges. ""If you choose not to go to school, you still have to put in the same amount of work."" I think that very aptly sums it up.<p>Breadth or depth depends on whether your goals are to be a subject matter expert, or more of a high level architect, dare I say manager. I work with very intelligent people who get hard problems solved, but not all of them can see the forest through the trees.

It is easy to follow the mind's natural tendency to become distracted. You think about related math. You think about your math professor that first talked about it. You think about unrelated math. You think about practical applications.<p>The breath is simple. You observe the breath going in and out. When your mind it on something else, you return it to the breath. Over and over.

4647807,comment,4644463,4647194,1,0,beagle3,,,"> So maybe EBM is abused in practice... but I don't see your examples showing this.<p>I was giving a (paraphrased) example from my history - it was 10 years ago, and I didn't keep my notes.<p>But Seth's example is typical: A result (negative in this case) applicable very narrowly is assumed to apply very broadly (By a top practictioner in the field, and his view is unlikely to be rejected; most readers will take his conclusion without trying to confirm or criticize the rationale).<p>> the effect from bad timing should either be undetectable due to contaminating only 1/31 of the data (1 day out of each month), or if the negative effect is persistent over many days, renders every single anecdote & self-experiment (including mine) completely unreliable trash since none of them were expecting an effect which contaminates so many days.<p>I don't follow you; In this experiment, they gave 100,000IU once a month; meaning that there must be a sharp rise in the beginning, followed by a decay which we believe (from other experiments) to happen slowly over a month.<p>If the effects are modulated by the _delta_ in vitamin D, rather than the _level_ (e.g. if there's a phase-locked-loop somewhere), then Seth's reasoning applies perfectly well: In the JAMA experiment, there is a (very small) constant negative delta, and nothing for a biological PLL synthesizer to ""lock on"" to - whereas with your experiment (and other anecdata collected by Seth), the sleep cycle can be locked onto the Vitamin D delta (with 12 hour delay), and all would make sense.<p>> so anyone trying to refute them so simplistically would be engaged in poor reasoning;<p>Yes, that's exactly my point. Most people who think they follow EBM are actually engaged in poor reasoning, and even worse meta-reasoning, as in: ""The fact that other people did not notice that this evidence is inadequte, is evidence that YOUR reasoning is flawed"". Yes, more than one person with an MD/PhD told me that if what I claim about how B12 is produced is right, they would have learned about it in school; even after they relented and looked it up themselves!<p>Furthermore, most placebo-controlled double-blinded experiments are not actually blinded: the substance or procedure being tested is known to have an effect (e.g. dry mouth) but it is not known if it has the <i>desired</i> effect. The placebo is known to have no effect (e.g. sugar pills). The patient therefore knows when they got the real thing (though they're still in the dark if they got the placebo).<p>The only way this is ever controlled for (if at all), is by comparing to an accepted substance/procedure used for the same purpose - which might, itself, be subject to the same kind of bias.<p>So, to cut a long story short ... The ideal of EBM is nice. The practice is very, very far away, but is assumed by most EBM proponents to have all the properties of the ideal.",1350099268

There are a remarkable number of ways to strike a ball wrong - and it is interesting to consider <i>why</i>, having learned the game sufficiently, one would ever strike the ball wrong. Where does the variation creep in? Why, if I examine a table and decide to put the cue ball ""just so"", can I not do that? The answer, of course, is that there is countless non-verbal data that your body is sending you on each stroke - feedback from your bridge hand, the hand on the cue, even your stance and the feel of the felt all factor into this.<p>If you are attached to the outcome, all of this goes out the window.

This entire post basically amounts to ""just trust this guy, he's <i>Governor</i> Romney!"". Facts? Numbers? Nobody needs these things. Let's gloss over all the evil things that were done at Bain. Unicorns and rainbows, just vote for my guy based on these vague promises of low tax utopia!<p>""-  He will work to remove regulatory impediments to energy production and innovation that raise costs to consumers and limit job creation.""<p>Let's conflate <i>innovation</i> with the ability to destroy the environment however we see fit.<p>""He  was hired to fix the state of Massachusetts and he feels certain that he did.""<p>That's some debatable propaganda right there. We should always believe anything someone <i>feels</i>.<p>And then, of course, it ends with this:<p>""Im not saying you should or should not vote for either of the candidates.""<p>LOL again. All that <i>illogical</i> fawning stuff I said up above? Just ignore that. Vote for whoever you want. Just wanted to get my ""feelings"" out there. On my blog. With lots and lots of subscribers. No one's going to read this.",1350098260

No, he said. ""I would stand by exactly what I've done.""</i><p><i>""My wife is disabled. I got a home and a mortgage, and if this hits the fan, I believe this will affect negatively on my employment,"" he said. ""I do my job, go home watch TV, and go on the internet.

You know as well as anyone that one of the most obnoxious and pernicious side-effects is non-termination. This is bad enough in the CPU, but when DoS-like attacks are perpetrated on the GPU shaders or other I/O ports, we can create unfortunate lockups and non-responsiveness.

The cause is of those structural changes is mental.<p>The goal here is changes that are highly subjective and personal.

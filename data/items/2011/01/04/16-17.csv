There is no question about it.<p>Sure, the corruption is from a less powerful position, but the morals and outcomes are largely the same: Someone is selling privileges they <i>have no right to sell</i>, and the same mentality is the mentality that allows corruption in public office.<p>""Do you get mad when other diners at your favourite restaurant tip better than you and get friendlier service for their trouble?""<p>What a terrible example. Tipping occurs at the end of the transaction, and is intended as a reward for good service. If you had to pay the server before getting served, and it decided the level of care and concern you would get, I am quite confident that it would be forcefully abolished by every restaurant immediately.",1294160263

2067567,comment,2066722,2067048,0,0,btilly,,,"I agree that it is just divide and conquer, presented in detail, with some specifics thrown in on techniques that are useful in mathematical proofs.<p>However I think that this is useful, even for students with decent problem solving skills.<p>The biggest issue that I was trying to solve is clearing up misconceptions about what a proof actually is.  A beginning student knows that proofs have to be utterly convincing.  They know that even many basic and obvious things require proof.  So they are uncertain what techniques are OK to use.  Worse yet, all of their liberal arts education pushes them towards believing that the way to make something convincing is to add verbiage, examples, supporting references, and so on.  All of which is the exact opposite of what you actually want to do in a mathematical proof.<p>A second issue that I was trying to address is the art of reading problems and figuring out what it actually says.  This is why I included specific advice on how some common phrases actually cover two separate claims.<p>A third issue is that students arrive at a first course where they have to do proofs having seen (and usually ignored) lots of examples of worked proofs, but never having done one.  Even if you use divide and conquer elsewhere, there can be a barrier to realizing that this is the technique you need to use here.<p>And that assumes that the students are competent at divide and conquer.  But there are many paths through academia where you can arrive at the first course where you have to do mathematical proofs without having explicitly learning to divide and conquer.  You can complain about that situation, or do something about it.  I chose to do something about it.",1294159991

It will make you eloquent.<p>Just last morning, I memorized the Carl Sagan story on our pale blue dot, and already I have subconsciously borrowed phrases from it twice in writing and conversation.<p><i>“Look again at that dot. That’s here. That’s home. That’s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every “superstar,” every “supreme leader,” every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there–on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.<p>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.<p>Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.<p>The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.<p>It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we’ve ever known.”</i><p>– Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot, 1994",1294159221

To me, the second guy who pretended to be the hunk, got inside info and then got the woman on a date seems to have used a much more creepy strategy. Why? Because he lied TO THE PERSON HE IS SEEING. The denial of service wasn't lying to the person he is seeing. It is lying to all the other dudes. Which is just fine. Lots of guys are COMPETING for the same girls, and in a competition like that, you don't necessarily have to play fair. I see this more as using intelligence to get a leg up on the competition, and frankly, the only reason why he wouldn't want to confess this to her -- is NOT that he would seem like a lying creep -- but because it would highlight the fact that he wouldn't be able to get her otherwise.<p>As if girls never do a ""denial of service"" attack to guys when they are competing for the same guy.

This time, he takes aim at the perennial corporate crime of turning people into cogs in a machine. Recent b-school grad Stephen Jones, a fresh-faced new hire at a Seattle-based holding company called Zephyr, jumps on the fast track to success when he's immediately promoted from sales assistant to sales rep in Zephyr's training sales department. ""Don't try to understand the company. Just go with it,"" a colleague advises when Jones is flummoxed to learn his team sells training packages to other internal Zephyr departments. But unlike his co-workers, he won't accept ignorance of his employer's business, and his unusual display of initiative catapults him into the ranks of senior management, where he discovers the ""customer-free"" company's true, sinister raison d'être.<p>""The Deal"" by Joe Hutsko<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1438235844?ie=UTF8&tag=keysofgeni-20"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1438235844?ie=UTF8&tag=...</a><p>Hutsko debuts with an effort to re-create the near-demise of Apple Computer with a thinly disguised cast of fictional alter egos. Hutsko, who worked closely with Apple CEO John Sculley, casts Peter Jones in the role of Apple founder Steve Jobs. As the novel opens, Jones is unseated from his position by his best friend, Matthew Locke, a buttoned-down Sculley type who engineers a power-play and steals control of Jones's innovative computer company, Via Technology.<p>""The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement"" by Eliyahu M.

To revitalize the plant, he follows piecemeal advice from an elusive former college professor who teaches, for example, that reduction in the efficiency of some plant operations may make the entire operation more productive. Alex's attempts to find the path to profitability and to engage his employeesi n the struggle involve the reader; and thankfully the authors' economic models, including a game with match sticks and bowls, are easy to understand. Although some characters are as anonymous as the goods manufactured in the factory, others ring true. In addition, the tender story of Alex and his wife's separation and reconciliation makes a touching contrast to the rest of the book.

All the dot-com punching bags are here: the lampooning of new economy jargon, the girlfriend worrying about her boyfriend's sudden obsession with the company picnic, and jokes about Pets.com. What saves the book from being an exercise in shooting fish in a barrel is Daisey's sharp eye: he renders even banal corporate moments with energy and wit.",1294157865

Most of them prefer to go back home because they would get a better job, which is normal for western educated young worker.<p>I went back home twice since 2009 and traveled in SE Asia a bit. I see why people wanted to go back: it's not just the job, it's the culture, the networks, friends, family. The whole package.<p>It's easy to ""connect"" with people who have big businesses there. Often you meet them in odd places like noodle shops, outdoor markets, food courts.<p>Night life is definitely better. By night-life I mean strolling down the Clarke Quay in Singapore, eat dinner outside style food court in Jakarta, or wandering around Ginza in Tokyo, enjoy Seafood in Jimbaran (Bali) mostly with your husband/wife and kids. Not necessarily means clubbing or bar. Thus better here is relative.<p>After a while, the fried chicken and the filet mignon became dry and tasteless to my wife and I. We've decided to pursue ways to go back to Asia starting this year. We'll see if we can go back there soon enough before our retirement (plan was to go back to retire).",1294157106

A company, which we'll call Alan Smith Homes, has been using johndoehs.co.uk in lieu of my domain. I regularly receive confidential email intended for them, signed up by both their own employees and external parties.<p>This week, I received a signup to a premium web service, which had my email on. I was concerned about my username/password being compromised (but I was sure I wasn't in the Gawker dump...), did a password reset, then found out that the account is probably for one of these people as well.<p>John Doe is doing quite well, and has offices around the country now, and appears to be coveted winning awards in their business sector. I would like to sell the domain to them, but they have only ever offered to take control of the domain and offer me back email addresses I want! This time, it seems like things might move along, but I doubt they have a realistic expectation of its value. I think the domain is pretty valuable to their business, and would put a higher valuation than I am sure they have on it.<p>How much do you think a domain to a non-IT company, but well-trading company, where misaddressed confidential email is fairly common, is worth?",1294156829

The vast majority of consumers simply don't have the awareness of such issues to even care. To a degree, the same criticism applies to the iPhone and it's been an overwhelming success. Competing with Apple is no small task. Features aren't enough when they have market share, mind share, are able to set trends and have a marketing department that has convinced the world they are the only company able to do the things they do.",1264690768

I have been following the story for as far as I remember as I had an interest in Ice Ages. This article <a href=""http://www.warwickhughes.com/icecore/zjmar07.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.warwickhughes.com/icecore/zjmar07.pdf</a> is very good at debunking some of the myths. You can play with a model online with this <a href=""http://cs.clark.edu/~mac/physlets/GEBM/ebm.htm#tiptop"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cs.clark.edu/~mac/physlets/GEBM/ebm.htm#tiptop</a> and you can download a more sophisticated program <a href=""http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/modelE/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/modelE/</a> from Goddard, or you can write your own Clojure one, like the one we had yesterday here at HN.<p>There is no doubt that an increase in CO2 will increase temperatures. However, this is only part of a model. C02 can get absorbed by the Oceans and other earth mechanisms and balance out. If you follow the Palaeoclimate literature (ice cores in Antartica) the rise in temperature gave a rise to C02 and not the other way round.<p>You can look how the  famous hockey stick curve looks if plotted against historical times (it looks more like a series of hills).<p>Serious variations in temperature (on a global level) are caused mostly by sunspot activity. I am sure other HN posters can add 100's more argument to these.<p>However, as humans there is no doubt that we are destroying our environment. As such I am very much for better policies in this respect but certainly NOT for trading carbon credits and fattening fat cats further.",1264690541

questions in early December to Verizon Wireless regarding the company’s recently increased

that Verizon elected to raise its early termination fees for certain ‘advanced devices.’
         “Late Friday, Verizon Wireless responded to the Bureau’s queries. The company’s
answers, however, are unsatisfying and, in some cases, troubling. In particular, I am concerned
about what appears to be a shifting and tenuous rationale for ETFs. No longer is the claim that
ETFs are tied solely to the true cost of the wireless device; rather, they are now also used to foot
the bill for ‘advertising costs, commissions for sales personnel, and store costs.’ Consumers
already pay high monthly fees for voice and data designed to cover the costs of doing business.
So when they are assessed excessive penalties, especially when they are near the end of their
contract term, it is hard for me to believe that the public interest is being well served.</i>",1264690082

They took KHTML and invested some resources into it.

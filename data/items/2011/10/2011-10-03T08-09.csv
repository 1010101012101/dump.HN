The key of meeting people is simple: you hope that you see/find somebody doing something which inspires you and brings new stuff to life. That's the pattern about how we try and learn new things (like children): you see somebody doing something and you say to yourself, hey I can do this too.<p>But back to your comment:
If I stay home and dive into a new topic it's always 100% more productive. I remember those days when I was learning Ruby at a Saturday night when my friends were heading to the same clubs they visited every weekend and I knew that they are wasting their time (usually you feel the opposite when a bunch of people you know meet/go out).
But the problem is that you usually need a trigger to get productive and just from surfing the web and reading Hacker News it's hard to get this trigger -- don't ask me why but getting active from just reading a blog post doesn't work (maybe there're just too many of them.)
So, at the end you need to have a good ratio of being productive and just being active/busy/meeting people.<p>A last thought: if I think back to all encounters on such startup events most stay superficial and lead nowhere. I got the most inspiration out of long-term relationships (coworkers).",1317630622

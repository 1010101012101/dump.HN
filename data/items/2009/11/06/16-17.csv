926362,comment,925955,926275,0,0,jordanb,,,"Yes. The recession began in late 2007. Unemployment didn't start spiking until mid-2008.<p>What happens is that companies are not anxious to start laying off employees when the economy goes south, for a variety of reasons. So they start spreading less work among their existing workforce. Worker productivity and hours worked both go down.<p>This makes these leading indicators. On the other end, when the economy starts winding up at the end of a recession, the now-lean companies aren't anxious to start hiring again. So instead they start giving their existing workforce more work, asking people to work more hours, etc. So you have the opposite: unemployment stays high for a while while productivity and hours spike.<p>Worker productivity is currently ""surging"":\n<a href=""http://news.google.com/news/search?aq=f&um=1&cf=all&ned=us&hl=en&q=worker+productivity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.google.com/news/search?aq=f&um=1&cf=all&...</a><p>However, hours worked is ""holding steady"":\n<a href=""http://news.google.com/news/search?aq=f&um=1&cf=all&ned=us&hl=en&q=average+weekly+hours+"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.google.com/news/search?aq=f&um=1&cf=all&...</a><p>What that means, I'm not qualified to say. And it looks like real economists are (as always) of differing opinions on it. Ideally you'd want to see both of those indicators on the up-tick, but given that one is increasing and the other is not getting worse, it's probably a sign that unemployment is going to start going down here pretty soon.",1257526693

Experienced DBAs were shocked and horrified.  Over time the database has matured, however its initial success stands as a testament to the principle that there are a lot of problems (particularly in the web area) where people care that the site does what they want and is responsive, but are tolerant of occasional problems.<p>Yes, I am aware of all of the possible shortcomings.  However requiring people with good ideas to understand more theory before they can get things done does not help motivated newcomers to get interesting things done.  And lots of newcomers getting interesting things done leads to successful startups.

All money is only a medium of exchange, and is only worth what people collectively agree it is worth.<p>I'm going to take a guess and assume you mean gold, but if that isn't the case, I'm really curious to know.<p>The fact that people collectively agreed that gold was a good form of money has nothing to do with any intrinsic (or god given) value of gold. It had everything to do with certain properties of gold that made it a good medium of exchange. Namely, it's durable, portable, hard to counterfeit, malleable, etc.<p>Eventually, gold's cause was assisted by tradition. People have been using it to represent money for so long they mistakenly believe it has intrinsic value. (Granted, gold isn't a bad choice, <i>if you are betting on the fact that others will irrationally value it</i>.)<p>So yes, it's harder for governments to manipulate a gold-backed currency... but it's not that hard. The US effectively did it twice, most recently after WWI with the Gold Reserve Act. Also, your money supply is now open to manipulation by private entities and even individuals. Gold mining companies, for instance, would have powerful sway over the amount and price of gold.",1257526388

Benchmarking requires taking a measurement before the code, running the code to be measured possibly multiple times, and taking another measurement after the code. If you can turn the code to be measured into a callback, then the benchmarking code can be written once and reused elsewhere. But having to put all your benchmarks into their own methods, much less worry about state and possibly creating classes and initializing data in constructors, is pretty tedious. Closures avoid this tediousness.<p>(Yes, I'm conflating several concepts here, anonymous functions and lambda closures, for colloquial and didactic reasons. Nitpicking doesn't buy you much in terms of practicality when learning here.)",1257525599

It wasn't an organised stream of consciousness like reviewing often is, and becomes more about inspiration and catching it when it strikes. I frequently have a small 3""x8"" notepad stuffed into my pocket, I keep a large A4 notepad by my bed and I try to write anything down when I can, even if it serves no purpose in the end.<p>On the downsides of a computer, there are downsides of anything. I've mucked out my rabbits litter box as procrastination when the internet has been down. The main upside to not using a computer, is that when you procrastinate it actually saves you time later. The computer is the only machine where you can efficiently procrastinate and produce nothing whatsoever out of it. If you procrastinate by washing the dishes, well suck it self you don't have to do it later!

In this case, ""(1,0)"" and ""(0,1)"" are orthogonal; no matter how far in X you go, the amount of Y-ness doesn't change. (1,1) and (1,-1) are also orthogonal. In the metrics most people learn, this means the vectors are at right angles. (Forgive me this simplification, mathematicians, going further will only obscure things.)<p>Programmers tend to abuse this term to mean ""the two things are totally unrelated"", even though the term really only applies to certain mathematical constructs like vectors. Claiming that type-safety is orthogonal to garbage collection would mean the two are entirely separate concerns and that you can freely have none, one, or both, and that the two issues never matter to each other. Now, <i>technically</i> this isn't quite true, which is why I say we ""abuse"" the term, because the full meaning of ""orthogonal"" is that you will literally <i>never</i> be considering the effect of one while examining the other, and this is not true; type systems do some impact on GC, for instance. However, in many cases this is ""true enough"" for someone to say they are ""orthogonal"".<p>In this case, I'm not arguing merely that the precise definition is not met, because it pretty much never is, but that the spirit in which programmers use the term is also not applicable here, as the questions of ""code quality"", ""speed"", and ""developer experience"" are indeed tightly interrelated and so answers like ""you always have to sacrifice quality for speed"" are too simplified.",1257525323

Set realistic goals. Mine is ""500 words per day, no excuses."" It takes 1-2 hrs.<p>2. Start when it's easy. I started my 500 word per day rule over a week-long vacation. This builds the confidence that you can achieve your goal in a reasonable amount of time.<p>3. Have a routine for getting started. I have a special writing playlist and play the same song every time I start writing. Over time your brain forms associations and will automatically go into the appropriate mode.<p>4. If you're having trouble getting started, try imagining how good you will feel once you've hit your daily goal. While you're doing that, count from 10 to 1 as if you're about to launch the space shuttle. Then start.<p>5. Focus on daily progress. Your feedback loop should be ""I won at writing 500 words today,"" not ""I'm now 10.5% done instead of 10.3% done.""<p>The writing itself is never going to become truly automatic or habitual.

However, the denouement isn't as integral as the rest, in fact many novels/plays/movies leave this out and it can frequently be a twist in horror movies (for me the only thing that made Quarantine a passable movie is because it had no denouement - everyone died) and tragedies.<p>The next step is usually turning those acts into chapter summaries; these are 1 liners that explain what the chapter is advancing in the plot (this can literally be as simple as finding a key to a locked door), what I'm currently working on has chapter summaries of single words as it's enough to remind me of the plot). Once you have the goal of every chapter you can begin work.<p>Honestly as a writer I would say you're completely fucking nuts for even wanting to try. However, I'd recommend anyone give it a go as it's very self-fulfilling. I dumped over 40,000 words onto the sidelines last week when I found myself wandering as it had taken me over 3 months to get that far and I was missing the aim (the story is sound however, so it's not been abandoned), what I replaced it with I'm at 10,000 words, full plot outline and about 5,000 words of notes. However the 40,000 words I dumped had itself supplanted a 30,000 word work that had swallowed a gargantuan 9 months and died because it was written in the complete wrong narrative. The effort to rewrite defeats the purpose, so it's now getting major plot revisions and will be written in 1st not 3rd. Despite all this, you don't feel the stress from dumping months of work essentially into a trash can because you can actually see how your writing changed from start until trash.",1257524295

Some people use this free will to restrict the free will of others. Sometimes this is a government, sometimes it's a corporation, or sometimes it's a kidnapper.<p>But what hypothetical external agent could ever ensure that no one's free will will be restricted? To have such a system would necessitate restricting people's free will so that they couldn't restrict each other's free will; it would be a self-defeating situation.<p>This is analogous to the set of all sets in mathematics, or other paradoxes that arise by having ""all powerful"" objects. Humans are so free, that we are free to kill ourselves (for instance), and remove our freedom. Likewise, we are free to disable our own free will.<p>How could Rand change things so that this is not the case?<p>In my view, governments are the result of the utter freedom we have as humans. It is simply absurd to think of getting rid of the systems that restrict freedom; if we did, the freedoms granted would simply create new systems, like corporations, or another government, that would replace all the functions of the system we got rid of.<p>Let me put it another way: It seems we already have maximal liberty.

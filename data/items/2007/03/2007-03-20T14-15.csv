5171,comment,5164,5164,0,0,staunch,,,"Thanks for the heads-up post. This is great. I've long hoped there'd be some way for those of us that can't attend YC stuff to get a peak.<p>In case any Justin'ers read this: On the Lingr chat I can't send messages in either Opera9 or Firefox2 under Linux. Tried other Lingr chats and they work fine, so probably something Justin specific.<p>Error: times has no properties

5166,comment,5157,5158,0,0,sethjohn,,,"Very interesting, turns the market upside down.<p>You could run it like a startup model combined with the recent doritos campaign (big cash prize for the winners). Throw around small (seed) money to anyone with a half decent idea...give out ""A-round"" funding to campaigns that focus-group well to expand their ideas...and entice everybody onwards with a big cash prize (acquisition!) for the campaigns that succeed.<p>You would need a very solid plan for determining ""effectiveness"" of the campaigns. Something that the advertisers trusted enough that they are willing to guarantee payment when you determine their campaign has been  ""successful"".<p>Pretty simple site with a client side where advertisers can submit the broad outlines of what they're looking for, user side for submissions. Sit in the middle and skim off a little cash as the money flows past...<p>Very scalable. Advertisers are desperate for creative new approaches. Billions for the taking.",1174400481

5163,comment,4994,5118,0,0,joshwa,,,"I'm actually quite curious about how he's accomplishing this... my best guess is that he's using the demographic info to redirect each age group to a different URL, e.g. 18-25 goes to pof.com/a/, 26-45 goes to pof.com/b/, and 45+ goes to pof.com/c/.<p>I was hoping though, that if my users are talking about cars, they get car ads.

Or the ability to self-fund your own projects without having to settle?<p>I'm not saying being rich makes you happy or that it doesn't have its own set of problems -- just that it can provide the freedom of choice and financial security to allow you to worry about the truly big challenges in life.<p>Spending 75%+ of your waking hours working just to put food on the table is pretty boring, even cavemen had this much.",1174399744

(one time code and such) There's no reason, other than for practice, to waste time designing such cases.<p>2. You may find out that you're solving the wrong problem, and it's much easier to justify throwing out code that you didn't labor over an extensible design, etc. It's much harder to throw away wrong code that you've put work into the internal design.<p>3. This doesn't mean that you don't design the outward facing interfaces correctly. Thus, you have a good set of unit tests already set up, and you can quickly tell if something is working as you refactor. You have a good baseline with which to compare.",1221458377

304361,comment,304050,304275,0,0,robak,,,"Well, they do, but here is the thing they are afraid of:
Before WW2 the US economy was doing poorly. The war brought a lot of war manufacturing business and huge boom in the US occurred thanks to the war production.<p>Economist at the time were afraid that the end of war will kill the boom because there will be no more war production needed. Well, once the war was over big US companies just switched their production capacity to civilian markets: cars manufacturing, appliances, houses construction... there was no contraction after the war. Opposite: 50s were the time of enormous economic boom.<p>Now, you are mistaken with setting ""Prisoner dilemma"" as the problem foreigners have. They may also look at their situation from the same perspective as Americans did during WW2. That is: If we stop producing for the export to the US (war effort) - there will be crisis. Who will buy our stuff but the American consumer. Well, no fear. Just switch production to your domestic markets as US did by switching industrial production to its domestic market after WW2. Nothing bad will happen with China the day ""war"" will be over and China will stop exporting production to the US. They will just realize that they have huge 1.3 billion consumer market at home and no need to export to the US. They will just switch production.<p>Therefore, Prisoner's dilemma has nothing to do with the fear of losing market based on false predictions. Nothing happened to the US market once the war was over. Nothing will happen to China once its main customer goes bankrupt.",1221457820

304351,comment,303720,303720,0,0,hugh,,,"A lot of comments already, but I'll just make two points:<p>1. I suspect that a lot of what's being trained in handwriting classes is not just the ability to make legible versions of the 26 letters of the English alphabet, but rather general skills of hand positioning and fine motor control. Kids need to pick these skills up one way or another.<p>2.

The only example I can think of is the leap of intuition that geniuses sometimes have, that give an entirely different view of a problem: e.g. speed of light would appear constant if observers had different time frames; the molecules could be linked in a ring; water is displaced by volume.<p>But the new perspective is itself very simple in each case (assuming the background) - the leap is in having the insight at all, not in its complexity. These are not leaps in complexity; and therefore not counter-examples to ""Gall's Law"".",1221456571

So whenever somebody says something interesting, I can get it down unobtrusively, quickly, and actually then reuse those notes later on in further conversations.<p>That's why I made a wearable computer. ...<p>I went to a heads-up display. I could put the focus on the whiteboard, and suddenly I could keep up. And I found not only could I keep up and take good notes, especially with this one-handed Twiddler keyboard I have, but it actually focused my mental attention, so that during a lecture I got a whole lot more out of it than ever before. And that's why if you've ever seen me in a meeting or a lecture, you'll see me taking notes furiously on my wearable computer not just so I get it, but also because it keeps my attention focused. I can put in new ideas and new offshoots and things I want to ask later into the stream of data that I'm capturing. ...<p>I also have a one-handed keyboard called a Twiddler. It has 12 keys on the front and six keys on the top. One of those keys is actually a joystick. It allows me to type up to 130 words per minute, though I maintain about 70 when I'm writing papers, that sort of thing. ...<p>And this is the system I wear basically every day. Right now, if you looked at my screen, you would see that I have all the previous conversations I had with David here – one on 25 January 2006, one on 25 January 2007, and one 29 January 2008, today. So every time I've met with Gartner, I've kept notes on the conversation.</i><p>This is the Twiddler:<p><a href=""http://www.handykey.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.handykey.com</a>",1221455963

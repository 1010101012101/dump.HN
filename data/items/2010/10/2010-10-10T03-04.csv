The original article does not proclaim any particular theory on Global Warming.  Rather, it criticizes the process by which science is being politicized.  This strikes me as a matter for which any scientist should be allowed to speak.<p>I take offense at the notion that anyone who would want to question the process can be presumed to be acting out of pecuniary interest rather than a desire to find truth.

1776519,comment,1775584,1775655,0,0,Niten,,,"This especially scares me as a cyclist.  I'm sure they'll put a lot of effort into preventing automated cars from hitting other vehicles or slow-moving pedestrians.  Now what about bicycles traveling around 20 mph in the right-hand side of the lane?<p>Many people seem to neglect or completely fail to understand the risk of increased perception of safety leading to an overall <i>decreased</i> safety in these systems.  We can't have the best of both worlds – a machine's constant attention and reaction time coupled with a human driver's intuition – because the moment you give him an autopilot that he thinks will keep him out of trouble, the human sits back and stops paying attention to the road.<p>These automated systems may eventually become all-around better than any human driver, but it will be take many iterations to get there, and the first versions will certainly lack a human's ability to anticipate trouble before it arises.  It will be a long while before an autopilot can say ""hey, that car ahead is weaving unnervingly, the driver might be drunk so I should keep my distance"" or ""the cars ahead of me are curving slightly to the left, there might be a cyclist riding on the shoulder so I should slow down a bit and do likewise.""

I'm just guessing, subject to actually doing the math, that increased efficiency and assumptions of reasonable limits on how much latent demand is actually out there could be sufficient to make time spent in cars, fuel consumption, emissions, or other metrics better regardless.  Since we're using networking analogies, basically I'm guessing that current uncoordinated human-driven traffic is copper wire to an automated system's fiber-optic cable.<p>But again, it's just a guess, and I'd be the first to accept that I was wrong if the numbers didn't actually work out.",1286682056

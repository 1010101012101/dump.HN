275915,comment,275792,275792,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"The premise of the article is a bit far fetched. Kids aren't fat because our culture is safety obsessed. They are fat because Grand Theft Auto is more fun than little league or hanging from monkey bars. The riskier playground equipment of yesteryear does not stand a chance against thousands of computer games designed specifically to hold kids' attentions for long periods of time.",1218700162
275914,comment,275792,275792,0,0,dfranke,,,"It always pleases me when I read articles like this one.  The mere fact that the problem is being talked about with any regularity means that the pendulum is likely to start swinging back toward sanity.  (By the way, I grew up in Broward County and attended the elementary school that pioneered banning running during recess.)",1218699792
275913,comment,275792,275811,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"This isn't true at all - little leagues don't buy insurance, they have the parents sign a piece of paper that says that the league isn't liable for any injuries. The banning of base sliding is the result of aggressive safety obsessed parents, like the one in the article who complained about hot rubber playground mats.",1218699269

275910,comment,275618,275618,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"When we moved to the valley from Austin last year, we downsized dramatically.  We went from a 1430 sqft house with a two car garage and a huge lawn to a 1000 sqft (seems a bit smaller, actually) house with a single car garage spot (already filled with the landlords crap, except for the spot where the car would live--so not much room to pile crap up in there).  I sold my 350Z, since I wouldn't be commuting anymore and would be living walkable distances to almost everything I could need, while my girlfriend kept her car.<p>In the months leading up to the move, I sold about $4000 worth of guitars, analog synthesizers and other music gear, keeping only my three favorite guitars and a minimal set of recording gear.  We had a huge garage sale, bringing in nearly $1000, selling all sorts of stuff that we never used: camping gear, books, stereo equipment, computer junk, furniture, etc.  After the garage sale, we still had 12 bankers boxes worth of books to get rid of, so we sold them to Half Price Books (who gave us about $2.50 per box for them...).<p>Now we're going through another purge and organization period...because we realize we still kept too much stuff and it's taking up too much of our space and our lives.  Our rent is going up next month, and I'm considering smaller digs because of it, since this time I know that I can easily get rid of even more stuff, if I take the time to do it (the fact that most rental properties are hostile to dogs is the only major factor keeping me here).  With a good library in walking distance, I no longer buy books.  I've bought maybe five books since living here, all work-related, and all books that I found myself checking out and renewing from the library several times, so I knew I'd use them a lot.  I've bought no new movies, since NetFlix, Hulu, iTunes, Unbox, and the library provide all the entertainment we need (Wii games and accoutrement excluded).<p>In short, less stuff is a win.  I recommend it heartily.",1218698688

We now live in USA, and have a baby.<p>Well, I'm just wondering where the hell, he's going to play.<p>When I was a kid, we were playing soccer on the street, or in between the blocks, throwing stones at other kids, fighting with plastic/wood swords, driving self-mad woodcars, and everyday I was with a scratch, or I dunno what else.<p>Even earlier when I was 4, me and my cousing, just an year older than me, somehow decided that we need one of our toys that was left in the other part of the city, so we just took off (I'm not sure what's the distance - but it was in the 5km-10km range) and started walking... Everybody got scared, family, etc. But it was fun story anyway...<p>This all was up till 8th grade, when I started programming, once that started, I kind of lost interrest in playing outside, it was just the Apple ][, my friend's Oric, and my other's friend PC.<p>Well I certainly want my kid to play for free, hopefully there are some parks around, but the whole society is a bit too much afraid. Yes, I know - sexual predators, kidnappers, yada, yada - it's a little 1984 that we us parents create though, for our own safety (so our mind is always safe).",1218698542

275904,comment,275789,275789,0,0,michael_dorfman,,,"I'm an American who has been living in Norway for 10 years, and I can say that while the author is correct about many points, there are a lot of complicating factors he ignores.<p>For example, Norwegian is tonal, and has a range of vowels that are quite unlike anything in English.  Further, every region has its own dialect-- even native-born Norwegians have trouble understanding some of them.  Finally, Norwegian has two written forms, so there are two dictionaries and two sets of grammar rules.",1218698032

275902,comment,275780,275780,0,0,netcan,,,"It's interesting that all these complaints from ""IP facisim"" to price are usually along the lines of:<p>I shouldn't pay you because... or I will pay you because...<p>That's not really a situation of ownership. At least not in the conventional sense. The conventional ownership meaning is 'I will pay you for this because I want it & otherwise I can't have it.' 'If you charge me an outrageus price, I will complain, or even not buy it.'<p>I mean airport souvenir shops don't get more shoplifting because they have 1000% markup.<p>Not sure what that means but payment feels voluntary to most people.",1218697676

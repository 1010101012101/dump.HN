Due to the 140 character limit, due to the lack of features like image uploading, etc. Maybe, just maybe, the ecosystem that has been built around Twitter — largely due to lack of features — actually plays in their favor?<p>I just don't see how you can be so sure that everything they're doing is wrong, and they're successful in spite of it, rather than successful because of exactly what they <i>are</i> doing.",1262786388

Bidirectional - unlike *nix. I think life would be easier if it were more straightforward to build applications as chains of little utilities with one-to-one protocols of integer exchange, rather than having to go to socket (more complex, and port management overhead) or file (ugly). I have a things-might-have-been-very-different feeling.<p>When is Team Plan9 going to produce a distribution that we can get into using as easily as Linux or the BSD kernels? :) (Or would inferno be a better focus? Same issue though - it's not as easy as ubuntu or even small projects like haiku)<p>Also offtopic - I like doing switch statements in python like this:<p><pre><code>    def fn_a(input_tokens): pass\n\n    def fn_b(input_tokens): pass\n\n    user_cmd = raw_input().split()\n\n    # look mum, no hands\n    { 'a': fn_a\n    , 'b': fn_b\n    }[user_cmd[0]](usr_cmd)</code></pre>",1262785912

I think everyone with a cellphone by now has been exposed to a carrier's store and seen prices for an off-contract phone. Hell, I'm guessing a lot of people have broken phones and been forced to pay off-contract prices - forcing the savvy to at least price out similar phones via alternate channels <i>cough</i> ebay.

It's about broadcasting 1->many</i><p>Why does ""communication"" only count on a 1 to 1 sense? Furthermore how can we possibly jump to the conclusion that just because it's about broadcasting 1 to many, that it is not about engagement? As a service I find it's engagement has a much longer-tail than that of facebook's. Once you've seen all the pictures, added all the obscure acquaintances,  and checked all the relationship updates facebook becomes more of a weekly ""check to keep up"" service than one of daily engagement. Twitter on the other hand is constantly engaging because it's one and only service is to allow people to bring fresh content/media/insight to many people with one update. There's no dilution of which feature i'm going to use now, or which one i'm going to get good at.<p><i>As a business decision, giving away access to 3rd party developers seems like favoring short term growth well above profit and the future</i><p>Really? If you realized your main product was this successful communication protocol (pg's words, not mine) you would want to limit it's usage to just your own domain? Your value is in the protocol itself, not where it's being used. If I was an investor, worrying why people don't use twitter.com would fall somewhere between ""did i leave the coffee maker on this morning?"" and ""where did i park my car?"".",1262784241

2295144,comment,2291336,2291607,0,0,chwahoo,,,"> This puts the user back in control of their internet activities, the way it should be.<p>Why should the user be in solely in control of how a content producer's material is consumed?  The vision you reference scares me a bit: We've already got a ""race to the bottom"" among manual laborers in the world, now we're looking to dedifferentiate and disempower our content producers as well?  If I put effort into writing a movie review, I think it's reasonable to expect some control over how it is consumed (e.g., people look at ads that benefit me, pay me, or maybe just come look at my website with a pretty picture of my face to make me feel special).<p>Don't get me wrong: I like having some freedom in how I use content.  I like having my music unencumbered by DRM to use on any current or future device I might buy.  I like using Google Reader to keep my finger on the pulses of all of my hobbies.  But I also sympathize with publishers about the Kindle DRM (and laud Amazon's attempts to make my Kindle content available on lots of platforms and devices) and with websites that just put a quick blurb or title in their RSS feed to force me to come to their site if I am interested.<p>Sadly, I haven't yet heard a proposal for how content should work in the future that strikes the right balance.  We seem to have publishers pushing toward extreme inflexibility and ""freedom"" advocates pushing towards (what you describe) a situation that diminishes any benefits (financial or otherwise) of content production.   I hope we can find a way to empower content producers while providing users with flexible (though, probably not entirely unencumbered or ""free"") ways of consuming content.  The status quo, even with its annoying ads and restrictions, seems better to me than either of the extremes.",1299448724

2295140,comment,2295051,2295051,0,0,newhouseb,,,"I spoke at TED this last week.  While it was one of the most inspiring things I've ever attended, I was somewhat underwhelmed with the age demographics represented.  There were maybe 10 people under the age of 25 (I'm 22).  On one hand it kind of exposed the inherent agism expressed in the valley that I was/am accustomed to, on another hand it was frustrating that it seemed as if I was somehow a young'n hanging out with the adults, and on yet another other hand it was inspiring to see people who have worked on one thing their entire lives and stuck with it until they've changed the world (whereas in the Valley so many people want to make their FU money and sit on a boat for forever).<p>It's definitely elitest in the strictest sense, but you have to realize that a lot of the people (at least the speakers) have passions that they have pursued not so that they could one day speak at or attend TED but because those ideas actually matter a lot.  The opportunity to attend TED is a byproduct of pursing your passion, which is infinitely more important than infinite snacks, gift bags full of stuff or even getting to meet your heroes (I met Jeff Bezos).<p>Unrelenting passion will get you farther than any ticket to a conference will.  The lucky ones are not the ones who get what they want (like a ticket to TED), the lucky ones are those who get to do what they are meant to do (who change the world for the better).",1299448552

Latex input would be nicer, but it's not terrible once you learn some of the keyboard shortcuts.<p>Matlab seems an odd thing to ignore.  It's pretty good for doing more computationally intensive work.  It's not fantastic, but it gets the job done and has good plotting features.  I generate a lot of publishable figures with matlab.<p>I've done some simulations using Fortran, and it's surprisingly good for a language it's age.  It's been continually updated.  Legacy features occasionally bite you in the ass.  C is for drivers.  I use it in the lab only when forced to.<p>So, what does Haskell offer?  It looks nicer than C.  Can I write drivers for odd-ball devices in it?  Probably.  Then again, I'm often just modifying some C-code from a vendor, so the choice is already made for me.  Fortran is so well entrenched that I'm still going to wind up using it if I ever want to run something through some crazy hydrodynamics code somebody else already wrote.

2295099,comment,2294579,2294833,0,0,mkramlich,,,"Agreed. Any software engineer knows it shouldn't take much more than 1 second, tops for a number to be incremented in one computer and decremented on another, separated across a network. Roughly speaking. Now add in fudge factor to account for a long and possibly unreliable network path (the Internet cloud, or similar private banking inter-network) and for the need to perform an atomic and 100% bulletproof and auditable transaction, and we can envision a scenario where the total latency between when the request is made and when the deal is done and put to bed as say 1 day, tops. And that's being very generous on implementation complexity assumptions. So when I hear things like 3-5 days, a week, 2 weeks, that's getting into insanity land. I smell either really old skool legacy systems in terms of process and hardware capabilities, or, something fishy like a sneaky way to allow the middle-men to earn ""carry interest"", or whatever, during that bloated time gap. Possibly also some government regulation which adds an enforced, artificial delay. But in terms of what are the actual minimum technical requirements to carry out that task, a few seconds would be generous, an hour would be padded and a day's wait would be bloated to hell. I could even say a day if each bank wanted to run all transaction requests as a single batch performed nightly, with human auditors being able to look at reports both the day before and after to ""sanity check"" results. But again, that should cause a 1 day delay at worst.<p>I am not a banking programmer, so take with grain of salt.

They have to find out what users want without the access to ""organic"" information, market research is proven time and time again to be worthless.<p>The problem of getting users is often one that defines a site, when you don't have that problem it becomes a battle to stop users leaving to better more ""mature"" pastures. I think the next big social site (if there ever is one) will be a no-name small-gone-big site, but even then with how everyone (users) is about social now (they want to be instantly in on the next big thing) I doubt that can happen. I think that maybe Facebook is the end of social sites, which feels strange and ridiculous to say, but maybe.<p>Google will never ""get"" social, there is nothing <i>to</i> get.<p>Edit: in fact I think a great example of this is Google Wave. It was a fantastic product for a variety of tasks, project management was one, yet Google pitched it as the ""next big thing"" to users so they all joined with ridiculous expectations of what it was and wasn't and now look what happened... Tumblr is another great example in the other direction, what the site is now is very community orientated, yet from the interviews I've seen with the founder (David something) it didn't seem as if this was intention from the get go, yet users used the site like that and so they adapted and enabled users to use it like that. Now look, they're <i>huge</i>. Does anyone know of any products launched by big companies (Google, Microsoft etc.) that did go big?

He has a pretty good selection laid out on the sidewalk there.<p>Basically, Blockbuster's video business (as distinct from its Yanqui snack business) consisted of allocating their scarce shelf space to supply the needs of the local movie-watchers.

What I would do, is when you submit a bid, write in something like ""I'm only doing this to enhance my portfolio -- can I reserve the right to show this to future employers?"" and if they say yes, you have something to show!  If they say no, double your asking price, or at least bring it up to standard value, and if standard value doesn't scare them away, you get moneys!<p>Seriously, there are threads on both HN and reddit about people who have made serious money on those sites, with piles of advice about which jobs to take and stay away from.

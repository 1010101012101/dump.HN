110977,comment,110541,110929,0,0,raganwald,,,"> > I get that you don't care for that.<p>> You're putting words into my mouth.<p>My bad: I misinterpreted what you meant when you said:<p>> Elegant is often a thing to be admired from afar<p>Any ways...<p>> > Turtles all the way down is a philosophy where you try to define a ridiculously minimal set of orthogonal axioms and build the language by combining those axioms<p>> What I'm talking about is the ""my whole environment must be Smalltalk/Scheme/Forth"", from the OS, or even silicon, on up. That's different from your version of turtles. Yours is not the enormous waste of time that the ""environment turtles"" are.<p>Perhaps I'm talking about ""turtles most of the way down"" and you are talking about ""turtles almost all of the way down."" I understand why you say what building, say, a Lisp Machine seems like an enormous waste of time.<p>> I'm still not sure whether consistency is really that important. People seem to do ok with some inconsistencies and warts in their languages, and continue to favor languages with warts and weirdnesses and quick idioms to the ones under discussion<p>Are we equating popularity with importance?",1202399804

I myself use a Mac, and had a NeXT machine oh-so-many years ago, and agree that design is a key differentiator.<p>The question isn't whether the designer is a key person we need, but rather whether joining six months after everyone else entitles her (or everyone) to the ""founder"" title.",1202399699

The only thing that's been pushed back is the contest deadline.<p>Apple has a history of creating great things that are never open enough to grab a large share of the market.

Also, we don't know yet who won all those spectrum auctions.<p>If Google did win those auctions, then Android does have a future. If they lost, I'm afraid that Android is probably not going to succeed.<p>Just look at how Sergey Brin is praising the iPhone and uses it all the time... that should tell you that maybe you should hedge your bets and start looking at the iPhone SDK as soon as it comes out instead of betting on Android... at least iPhone is real.",1202398870

First and second work for lists of two items, but they don't feel right to me for longer lists.<p>Also, they aren't the same length, and that would bother me. I'd prefer left and rite. Or alpha and omega. Or mom and pop. Then you can compose them into mop. Or maybe I'd better leave it to Paul, as I obviously can't be trusted with this kind of thing.",1202398063

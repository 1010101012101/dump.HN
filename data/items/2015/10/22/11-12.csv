10431672,comment,10431380,10431380,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"The Guardian is reading far too much into Tesco&#x27;s actions. Following the Paradox of Choice, the effect was widely studied and found to not be particularly robust. The classic jam study (cited by this article) failed to replicate. There are various circumstances when having more choices <i>increases</i> sales as well (e.g., a higher priced option that no one takes can cause more sales of the low priced choice). Even the author of &quot;Paradox of Choice&quot; admits the science is far from settled.<p>I&#x27;ve been to Tesco. From a consumer&#x27;s perspective, it&#x27;s amazing - I really wish I had a place like Tesco where I am. Most likely the reason Tesco is reducing choices is because <i>stocking more SKUs is expensive</i>, but at the end of the day the customer buys the same quantity of cheese. Choice is fantastic for the consumer, particularly the consumer with minority tastes. If you are an Indian or Nigerian person living in the UK and you are hungry for some home food, Tesco&#x27;s got you covered.<p>I&#x27;m not even going to discuss the blatant cheerleading for state monopolies and Corbyn.<p><a href=""http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/is-the-famous-paradox-of-choic/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/is-the-famous-parad...</a><p><a href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/9cebd444-cd9c-11de-8162-00144feabdc0.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/9cebd444-cd9c-11de-8162-00144feabd...</a><p><a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/08/more-is-more-why-the-paradox-of-choice-might-be-a-myth/278658/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/08/more-is-...</a>",1445515135

If you have a car and you get into auto accidents, you want to make sure that the other people on the road also have insurance -- but if they&#x27;re not protected and there&#x27;s an accident, that means that you&#x27;d have to pick up the costs.  Cyber insurance covers costs associated with a cyber attack.  If you&#x27;re a company that has access to a large number of credit cards, your rates are likely to have gone way up in the past year.<p>[Bob Paris, Marsh] The insurance industry has now absorbed several hundred-million-dollar losses in the retail and health-care space -- and for a relatively immature market as cyber is, having three or four hundred-million dollar losses is going to have an impact.<p>[Richard Bortnick, Traub Lieberman Strauss & Shrewsbury LLP] The claims frequency and severity was not anticipated, because you had no historical model to build in.  It&#x27;s all new, and everybody&#x27;s learning at the same time.<p>[Ron Beeson, Lockton] That increase isn&#x27;t going to work.  And what you are now seeing is certain insurers starting to invest, and work with in partnership with silicon valley, with certain technology companies, to help better understand the risk that the underwriters are writing and price the risk.<p>[Bob Paris, Marsh]  It&#x27;s an aggregation of things.  Various regulatory environment, the FCC, big breaches -- that&#x27;s when we started to see these huge purchasing trends start to change.  Now the question is more about resiliency -- because the thought is, you&#x27;re gonna get breached, you&#x27;re gonna get attacked, but how capable are you, how resilient are you, to work through that event?<p>[Richard Bortnick, Traub Lieberman Strauss & Shrewsbury LLP]  As their premium rates go up, they&#x27;ll probably increase prices to the consumer, and so it trickles down to the lowest denominator.  I think at some point the government is going to mandate certain industries have cyber insurance.  It&#x27;ll become enterprise risk management to have the insurance.  The alternative -- to be without insurance -- is to bet the business.<p>[Ron Beeson, Lockton]  Everyone should be investing in cyber security, regardless of whether you consider insurance or not.  But it&#x27;s important to understand that insurance does not replace that investment.<p>[graphic]  CYBER RISK -- Target expects insurance to cover $90 million of the $264 million of costs related to its 2013 attack.  Home Depot expects $100 million in insurance payments toward $232 million in expenses from its 2014 breach.",1445514701

The polysulfide is easy to synthesize on a large scale and requires no exogenous reagents or solvents. The polysulfide removes PdII and HgII from water and soil and turns yellow when exposed to mercury(II). This response is selective for mercury, a discovery that may find use in sensing applications. We plan to develop the sulfur-limonene polysulfide as an inexpensive material for environmental remediation, where it will be used to sequester toxic metals from complex mixtures. More generally, this research is part of a growing effort to identify new and useful properties of materials with high sulfur content6 and to synthesize them in an efficient and sustainable fashion.",1445513603

10431546,comment,10431380,10431380,0,0,ohthehugemanate,,,"There are so many assumptions and logical problems in this article&#x27;s reasoning... it&#x27;s distressing to read.<p>First we assume that choosing to purchase jam is empirically better than choosing not to purchase jam. And we ignore the question of how the jam selection is made, when the supermarket chooses for you: what is driving the supermarket&#x27;s selection of which single brand to offer? Is it price to quality ratio? Price? Partner deals on other brands? When I start a new jam company, do I aim to make a happy consumer, or a happy grocery store manager? This doesn&#x27;t seem optimal for the consumer at all.<p>The argument is later &#x27;bolstered&#x27; with the example of jeans; we&#x27;re told that they SHOULD be &quot;the ill-fitting sort&quot;, that “The secret to happiness is low expectations.” If you expect shitty jam, the supermarket can remove choice to satisfy your expectation. For that matter, so can the market of jam providers.<p>At last we get the example of pensions, where we can at least agree on the basic point that not choosing is definitely worse than choosing poorly. We&#x27;re advised that employers should choose for the employees to prevent this outcome. Again we leave aside the question of how the employer selects a &#x27;one-size-fits-all&#x27; pension plan. Does she optimize for the best pension for employees, or for the cheapest plan up front? And how does that change the behavior of pension plan companies?<p>Generally, choice in the market is an important driver of improving real and perceived value for consumers. Perhaps there are alternative solutions to &#x27;choice paralysis&#x27; that don&#x27;t involve sacrificing quality. Off the top of my head, expert advisors are a better solution than what the article offers. There are hundreds of wines at my local store, but I have no trouble making a choice with the guidance of the sommelier. There are thousands of health insurance options where I live (in Germany), but I&#x27;m confident that I make the right choice for my family with the guidance of my Versicherungsberater (insurance advisor). Interestingly this is a field that is difficult to automate, not least because humans trust human recommendations more than machine ones. I can imagine this author would praise the coming &quot;advisor economy&quot; as the solution to fears of machine-learning-driven unemployment.<p>In short: everyone accepts the premise that &quot;choice paralysis&quot; is real, and that it causes people to make sub-optimal choices. It&#x27;s an enormous leap however, to get to &quot;therefore having no choice, and expecting shitty outcomes, is the best answer.&quot;",1445512909

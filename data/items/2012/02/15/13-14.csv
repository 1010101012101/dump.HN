Over the past summer, we caught up and talked Facebook IPO for a bit. Basically, Goldman Sachs has it all wrapped up. If you've got a big name (like his dad), you could probably get in on the action. If you happen to know a big name, you might be able to get in on the action. For someone 3rd degree like me? Nope.",1329311646

I have edited and written a smattering of articles, and it has never been a waste of time, and certainly not dangerous to my SAFETY.<p>I don't know if anyone has gotten any value from my articles, but I have. I have written articles to help study for exams back in college, I've written articles to help my keep track of the TV schedule of a favorite but unpopular TV show, and I've written articles about favorite but unpopular books. I've also written and edited articles that I use as references for my work.<p>I never got involved in the ""politics"" of Wikipedia; I just care about making the content better for personal use.

Frankly I don't know enough about how NetworkManager works to dig into the source code and isolate the issue, since it's been ongoing for a while and I'm not the only person experiencing it I'm going to assume it would not be a simple fix.<p>I could use dhcp rules but then I sometimes have to move my development machine to other places where of course I will be on a different dhcp server which I may not have admin access to. The workaround of having a shell script that sends a bunch of ""ifconfig"" commands does the job for me whilst still allowing me to use NM for wifi config but it just seems like something that should be unnecessary.<p>I sort of assume that most experience Linux people have experienced some sound issues at some point. My problem with pulseaudio has always been the slight latency that seems to happen between sound being sent by the program and played by the speakers which means that for example when an MP3 file is paused the sound continues for a fraction of a second. Sure this may not be a huge issue and I didn't even notice it for a while but as soon as I noticed it, it really started to grind on me. Not to mention that it makes the system terrible for doing any kind of audio editing.<p>The solution for this is to uninstall pulseaudio and go back to ALSA which is a bit of a pain in itself, but once you've achieved this you get odd problems like (in ubuntu anyway) the sound control panel applet disappears and you have to run alsamixer to change the volume, also volume control for some programs (such as spotify) stops working completely.<p>There are a number of other various small issues that can make desktop Linux a pain to use sometimes, this is why I am often surprised that canonical seem to prioritize redesigning the GUI every few releases over fixing stuff like this.",1329311592

You can ""ask"" a question, or you can have a situation that requires a question be asked -- e.g. the situation can ""beg"" the question be asked. But raising a question doesn't really make any sort of sense in any possible usage. At any rate, if ""raise"" is meant to be used in the same way that one can ""raise"" awareness, then the meaning is still different than begging a question be asked.

It's so important that I'll <i>beg</i> you to learn about it.

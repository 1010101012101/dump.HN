Then, after a good 20 minutes, he said something to the effect of ""Gotcha!

2307784,story,,,12,9,ToPhDorNotToPhd,"Ask HN: Are there any other reasons to accept a PhD offer?",,"Out of a passion for both brain research and computation, I've been working towards getting into a PhD program in computational/cognitive neuroscience (my work would focus on applying machine learning techniques to fMRI data).     I've done this at a later stage than most people, having left a career in data analytics (I'm currently 31).<p>When I started out, I really thought that I'd pursue a career as a scientist/academic, but I've since read plenty of articles (one example among many: http://www.economist.com/node/17723223) about how abysmal the academic market is.  I'm also aware that in cogNuro and neuroscience, even the best people (with very few exceptions) post-doc for 4-5 years.<p>So, I'm at a strange stage.  \n1) I've been accepted to a top 10 program (private midwestern university) where I'd be working with a well established and very active advisor.  \n2) Yet, I'm fairly certain that I no longer want to be an academic.  Not only do I think my chances are slim of landing a decent job, even attempting to go the academic route would put me at 40ish before my first job.<p>My questions: \n-Is there any other reason for me to accept?  \n-Would the PhD have any value outside of being intellectually very rewarding (as one professor friend of mine said ""a 6 year adventure"")?\n-Are there any applied routes that I could go?  I do know that there are applications of this technology as ""lie detection"" and helping people with locked in syndrome, but it seems that these aren't nearly mature enough to produce jobs for PhDs.  Of course, doing machine learning would probably be applicable in the data analytics world, but if I'm just going to go back to my old industry, I wonder if I'd be better off doing a masters in stats, cs, etc.<p>I ask these because I'm really trying to find out if there's anything that I'm missing.  I just want to know if anyone is aware of some route that I don't see that would make this valuable.<p>If not, I may have to make the sad decision to turn down an offer to do some really cutting-edge research.",1299725557

Their current implementation is a skimmer with all of the logic and safety in the software with all the guarantees of PCI network security beyond that (lol, i bet its salesforce or ec2). On Verifone's end, it's not like we're talking some software-based encraption. Think hardware based asset tags to compliment client certs. Surely it's self-evident that the ease of obtaining what at the moment at best could be a client certificate from a phone and recovering the information from a tamper-resistant device that goes dark if you take it offline too long (rendering the information useless). If they took their device and made it less like a mouse and more like something that tried to tunnel through the stupidest medium ever, I could live with it a little more and see the 'they are stupidly insecure' argument as fud.<p>Second, you realize it took 1 person about a week to reverse, document and develop the PoC for blocking skype (me) and  not much longer for a crypto-library from it (accuvant ryan)?

I'd say that if they made the honest argument, Square would try to throw lawyers at them.

2307733,comment,2304341,2307643,0,0,Silhouette,,,"> I would genuinely be interested in seeing examples of significant harm from web analytics or behaviorally-targeted advertising.<p>I think advertising itself is more of an annoyance than a serious harm in most cases, though I would certainly regard targeting certain profiles with advertising for certain products as abuse. That is mainly where the target is unlikely or unable to make sound judgements, for example where children, adults with learning difficulties, those suffering from a recent emotional trauma, or those who are recognisably not well-informed about things like legal, medical or financial matters are involved.<p>However, what really worries me is that it's not only advertising that can be driven by this kind of personal profiling, and the effects in other cases can be far greater than the irritation of seeing yet another toy advert because you just uploaded some baby photos.<p>For example, here in the UK, there was a lot of media attention a couple of days ago, because it looks like car insurers are going to be forced to stop offering different prices to male and female customers just because of their gender. The insurers, of course, have been profiling, and argue that <i>on average</i> young male drivers are more expensive in terms of the accidents they have and the resulting cost. However, while there may be some correlation there, that doesn't imply a causative effect in any individual case, and it doesn't change the fact that there are many safe male drivers who are paying more and many dangerous female drivers who are paying less. Since all drivers are required by law to have insurance in my country, this sort of profiling has effectively meant that many good male drivers have been charged thousands of pounds of basically unescapable tax, just for fitting a naively constructed risk profile.<p>Is it such a leap to wonder what would happen if health insurance companies were able to start profiling on grounds that were not directly clinically relevant, particularly in countries where private health insurance is the norm?<p>What about profiling and employer blacklists: sorry, we can't give you the job, because even though you appear on the surface to be an excellent and highly qualified candidate, we've analysed your friendship network and several of your regular contacts have photos up on Facebook that our automated analysis software thinks show them being excessively drunk, which means that statistically there is a relatively high chance of you also having your work performance impaired for alcohol-related reasons. Oh, and just to save you some time, don't bother applying for any other jobs where your hard-earned specialist skills and useful experience would be relevant, because we know that the other four big name employers all check the same databases we do.<p>> I'm calling it a night, but I'll wrap up with a couple of quotes from the Online Publishers Association<p>As far as I'm aware, no-one is saying that publishers can't offer content on their own terms. The publishers will simply have to be transparent and up-front about what those terms really are now, and compete accordingly. Moreover, where there are monopolies or essential services involved, consumer protection regulation may be warranted in the same way that state-sanctioned monopolies, such as our railway and postal networks, are sometimes subject to pricing constraints dictated to them other than by market forces.",1299724545

2307703,comment,2307134,2307134,0,0,thelema314,,,"Article Text:<p>In part 1 of this series, I described how to find the closest match in a dictionary of words using a Trie. Such searches are useful because users often mistype queries. But tries can take a lot of memory -- so much that they may not even fit in the 2 to 4 GB limit imposed by 32-bit operating systems.<p>In part 2, I described how to build a MA-FSA (also known as a DAWG). The MA-FSA greatly reduces the number of nodes needed to store the same information as a trie. They are quick to build, and you can safely substitute an MA-FSA for a trie in the fuzzy search algorithm.<p>There is a problem. Since the last node in a word is shared with other words, it is not possible to store data in it. We can use the MA-FSA to check if a word (or a close match) is in the dictionary, but we cannot look up any other information about the word!<p>If we need extra information about the words, we can use an additional data structure along with the MA-FSA. We can store it in a hash table. Here's an example of a hash table that uses separate chaining. To look up a word, we run it through a hash function, H() which returns a number. We then look at all the items in that ""bucket"" to find the data. Since there should be only a small number of words in each bucket, the search is very fast.<p>Notice that the table needs to store the keys (the words that we want to look up) as well as the data associated with them. It needs them to resolve collisions -- when two words hash to the same bucket. Sometimes these keys take up too much storage space. For example, you might be storing information about all of the URLs on the entire Internet, or parts of the human genome. In our case, we already store the words in the MA-FSA, and it is redundant to duplicate them in the hash table as well. If we could guarantee that there were no collisions, we could throw away the keys of the hash table.<p>Minimal perfect hashing\nPerfect hashing is a technique for building a hash table with no collisions. It is only possible to build one when we know all of the keys in advance. Minimal perfect hashing implies that the resulting table contains one entry for each key, and no empty slots.<p>We use two levels of hash functions. The first one, H(key), gets a position in an intermediate array, G. The second function, F(d, key), uses the extra information from G to find the unique position for the key. The scheme will always returns a value, so it works as long as we know for sure that what we are searching for is in the table. Otherwise, it will return bad information. Fortunately, our MA-FSA can tell us whether a value is in the table. If we did not have this information, then we could also store the keys with the values in the value table.<p>In the example below, the words ""blue"" and ""cat"" both hash to the same position using the H() function. However, the second level hash, F, combined with the d-value, puts them into different slots.<p>How do we find the intermediate table, G? By trial and error. But don't worry, if we do it carefully, according to this paper, it only takes linear time.\nIn step 1, we place the keys into buckets according to the first hash function, H.<p>In step 2, we process the buckets largest first and try to place all the keys it contains in an empty slot using F(d=1, key). If that is unsuccessful, we keep trying with successively larger values of d. It sounds like it would take a long time, but in reality it doesn't. Since we try to find the d value for the buckets with the most items early, they are likely to find empty spots. When we get to buckets with just one item, we can simply place them into the next unoccopied spot.<p>Here's some python code to demonstrate the technique. In it, we use H = F(0, key) to simplify things.<p><SNIP><p>Experimental Results\nI prepared separate lists of randomly selected words to test whether the runtime is really linear as claimed.\nNumber of items	Time (s)\n100000	2.24\n200000	4.48\n300000	6.68\n400000	9.27\n500000	11.71\n600000	13.81\n700000	16.72\n800000	18.78\n900000	21.12\n1000000	24.816\nHere's a pretty chart.<p>CMPH\nCMPH is an LGPL library that contains a really fast implementation of several perfect hash function algorithms. In addition, it compresses the G array so that it can still be used without decompressing it. It was created by the authors of the paper that I cited. Botelho's thesis is a great introduction to perfect hashing theory and algorithms.\ngperf\nGperf is another open source solution. However, it is designed to work with small sets of keys, not large dictionaries of millions of words. It expects you to embed the resulting tables directly in your C source files.",1299723878

It costs money to run a news organization capable of international reporting and investigative journalism.

4603916,comment,4603611,4603611,9,0,kevingadd,,,"In my experience, game development is stressful enough as a white, biologically male young adult. I can only imagine what kind of a personal hell it must be to work in an environment like the one described by the OP.<p>I've ranted and raved before about how despicable I consider some of the HR practices common in the games industry, how how in particular I feel that certain companies treat their employees as disposable and prioritize the success of individual products over the health of the team and the health of the company culture.<p>This, however, is on an entirely separate level: The company management itself being complicit in the abuse of employees, and taking actions that not only damage the team & culture but actually jeopardize the success of products by seeding anger and distrust between team members. That even a single person in a management position would allow this kind of shit to go on is disgusting.<p>When Harbin (Kixeye's CEO) quoted Conan the Barbarian in their tasteless recruitment video ('What is best in life? To crush your enemies, to see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentations of their women.') my instinctual response was negative. To me, even for a company that intends to appeal to the hardcore male gamer audience, using that kind of language - language of oppression and sexism and violence - when talking about making social games felt unnecessary and excessive. It made me wonder if perhaps the company's CEO actually shared the perspective espoused by the fictional character of Conan - but that couldn't possibly be true, could it? Could someone actually feel that way about others so strongly that he'd be willing to say so, unabstracted, in a video designed to present his company to the rest of the world and excite prospective employees? Of course not, right?<p>I also find it extremely interesting to contrast-and-compare Kixeye's depictions of Zynga/Mark Pincus, and Kixeye, in their recruitment video [1] with my personal experiences with both companies. I almost feel as if the staff behind that video were projecting their own fears and insecurities onto their competitors.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5l-nnR4Bx0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5l-nnR4Bx0</a>",1349207676

4603913,comment,4603611,4603611,3,0,iandanforth,,,"A couple other commenters have mentioned this but in case the author is reading I want to emphasize the importance of winning the rhetorical war before you proceed to fight the fight you actually care about.<p>As with any story a reader wants to like the characters they are reading about. It's hard to like someone who is constantly angry, depressed, sarcastic, and bitter. You, as a person may feel these things, and be completely correct to feel them, however you make it hard to read your story without a contrast. For example, ""I love games"" or ""I love the way I feel in Oakland"" or ""I am so proud of my necklace I don't care what others think."" People can empathize with pain, but they also need joy, hope, and a reason to like you.<p>Another way to win the rhetorical battle is to use humor. Your reactions to the abuse are shock, horror, rage, and sarcasm. Feel free to interject a joke or two. In ten years you <i>will</i> be telling jokes about these ignorant people. Make them into caricatures, lampoon them, exaggerate their folly so that people will not just be angry at them on your behalf but seem them as an absurd throwback to a time you wish had passed.<p>Tell a story that demonstrates the moral high ground. What I remember from your post is that you tried to say something, gave up, then went home, got high and watched Netflix. People want to be inspired to take action, and if you have a story, even if it means talking to HR, that is incredibly powerful. How does your behavior model an appropriate response for others who might be in your shoes? A lawsuit may be appropriate, but from reading your story it seems like a dramatic escalation, you need to lead people into it.<p>I can't say I understand what you're going through, but I do support your effort and I'm disgusted on behalf of white-straight-geeks everywhere.

This phenomenon is well-understood in microeconomics, and things like database performance are just a special case of it.<p>Imagine a factory that makes widgets. At first there's loads of space, and half the factory is a basketball court for the first employees to relax after a long day of widget manufacturing. but if the widgets are good and demand increases, more and more of the factory is filled with widget-making machines. Finally the factory gets full and efficiency starts to go down because people are literally getting in each others' way as they work and move the widgets around; its costs more an more to squeeze out each additional unit. In technical terms, your Marginal Costs go up and bring Average Total Costs above the minimum where normal profits are maximized.<p>The solution to this is not to declare that no sane widget manufacturer should try to sell more than 10,000 widgets a year, but to set up an additional or replacement factory. Your Average Total Costs go up even higher because a new factory costs money (like a new DB infrastructure or server farm), but - and this is crucial - that cost of the new business infrastructure is a Fixed Cost, and the more product you ship the lower a proportion of each transaction it represents. The upside is that your Marginal Costs are now lower because you can again enjoy economies of scale.

Nevertheless, I hold a strong, irrational conviction in my destiny and that of my company.<p>What I'm looking for:\na CTO and a CEO, but more deeply, two friends and fellow comrades who'll go to war for our vision and for each other. I think any mission worth fighting for is more important than the individuals involved.<p>PS the site is built on python+django and the MVP is already up.

Meetup.com is a particular egregious example, being next to impossible to unsubscribe from.<p>Also, not all emails are equal. Emails from friends, family, or colleagues are important and should be treated on the same notification level as texts. But notifications emails from spammy websites set off the same notifications. I probably check my phone 90% of the time only to find out someone liked my post on <insert-social-network-here>. It's gotten to the point where I have to use multiple email addresses to register for websites.<p>My idea: A regulated email exchange. Each email account gets 10-50 tokens. Whenever someone emails you, they attach their token. As recipient, you can then choose whether to return the token or not. Keeping the token means that sender can't send you any more emails until you return the token. Returning the token means you acknowledge the email sender is legitimate and not a spammer.<p>Also, the less tokens a sender has, the less spammy emails they can send out. When they hit zero tokens, they're effectively dead in the water. The idea is to cut down on all the BS, unnecessary emails and raise the quality of sent emails.<p>In short: users exchange tokens with other users they want to interact with. users withhold tokens from other users they don't want to interact with. spammy websites have a lot less ammo with which to bombard users with.",1349206747

4603746,comment,4597156,4598210,4,0,dredmorbius,,,"A small enumeration of mutt's advantages in my experience:<p>- It's small, fast, and light.  I have a mail client that runs in a terminal window (or console session, or remote SSH session).  Navigation, search, and controls are all keybindings.  It's fast to fire up, compose, edit, navigate, filter, and send.<p>- Threading.  Mutt's thread-handling is second to none (though strongly influenced by newsreaders such as tin and slrn).  Threads may be expanded, collapsed, marked read, navigated, joined, and split.  Gmail's ""conversation view"" is a pale imitation.<p>- The ""limit search"" feature really rocks.  If you want to find a mail from, say, the 14th of the month forward, from bigboss, subject ""widget"":  ""~l ~d 15- ~f bigboss ~s widget"".  You can filter by date ranges, add either AND or OR keyword matches, search by text, etc.<p>- Once you've identified a set of messages to look at, you can scan through them <i>very</i> quickly via keyboard navigation. Very useful if you're dealing with a large number of automatic / system-generated mail, though others can be handled as well.  Literally:  scan several hundred messages in a matter of seconds, looking for major differences.<p>- Tagged message management.  Messages may be tagged ('<i></i>' key), either individually, or using filter/match rules.  Say you've looked at all your Nagios alerts and want to move them to an archive or delete them:  ""T.;s<archive-name><return>"".  Much faster than the equivalent in Gmail or any other GUI client I've used. This with limit search is the killer feature for me.<p>- In-line handling of MIME attachments.  There are console-mode readers for many document formats, including HTML, Word docs, spreadsheets, and presentations.  Even if they don't give you a fully-formatted view of the document, you can get the gist of meaning without firing up a full-fledged GUI app.<p>- Spawning MIME attachments.  If inline isn't sufficient, there's the attachment index (for mails with attachments) and you can launch these using the handler of your choice (specified by your mailcap file).  Attachments may also be saved from the index individually or collectively.<p>- Adding attachments. Similar to the MIME viewer -- this is actually faster and more flexible than most GUI tools (in particular, Gmail).  You can also add <i>messages</i> as attachments, not just files.<p>- Speaking of GMail:  if you do want to view a message in its GUI wholeness, just pop open a browser and view it there through GMail. IMAP means you've got a synchronized set of folders locally and remotely. You can also share IMAP access with a local GUI client (KMail, Thunderbird, Evolution, etc.).  This is particularly helpful for calendaring (I'm not aware of a MIME handler that will add ical event to a calendar).<p>- Comprehensive PGP support.  It's highly unappreciated and underutilized, but both encryption and signatures are supported. At the very least you can confirm signatures readily on security bulletins from most major Linux distros.<p>- Incorporated address books for completion.  Typically via an included 'aliases' file.  Start typing a name, hit 'tab', and a screen of completions appear.  Do this right an you can grab a list of related names in one pass.  You can also alias lists of addresses you use frequently (say, ""family"" or ""engineering team"" or ""zombie apocalypse task force"").",1349206016

The answers are crap. They don't even cite good sources, but are mostly anecdotes of lower quality than the typical anecdotes found on HN, and in some cases the anecdotal answers directly contradict what careful scientific research has found to be the general correct answer for the same question. But on many issues, Quora is just the opinionated leading the opinionated, and no one makes the effort to LOOK UP better, more reliable sources. I like the user culture here on Hacker News much better. I read whole books, for fun, after learning about those books on factual topics here on HN.

Those buttons don't need to take up so much room or be so bold. They could simply be links with tiny corresponding icons underneath the default login form. Taking those options away would be a detriment to both current users of those methods and future users who prefer the quick registration process it provides.<p>The argument thereafter that these logins could easily dissipate and are therefore unreliable is solved the same way SoundCloud does it; allow the user to set a username and password separate from their social networking account in their settings. The only problem with the SoundCloud method, at least at the time I did it, was that in order for it to activate, you had to reset your password.

I learned how to make and use a bump key from YouTube, practiced on my own front door and after a couple of hours could consistently spring the lock with a few whacks (seconds).<p>The weaker component is the (still available as a backup entry method) keyhole. A year ago, my neighbor locked herself out. I found out that she also had a Schlage lock and figured I'd try to help. After finding my disused bump key, I had sprung her lock after about twenty whacks. My total experience was two hours of practice three years ago. I don't consider myself to be uniquely skilled here.<p>Personally, I'd prefer a mechanism that would allow me to eliminate the key entirely. I'd rather live with the risk of battery drain/malfunction/phone loss.",1349204529

4603614,comment,4603414,4603551,2,0,tokenadult,,,"Thank you for asking the clarifying question. The hiring supervisor is just looking for a straightforward implementation of the problem specification. He showed me the C code that is the example in his mind of a correct C program. He was presenting this problem over dinner at a summer mathematics program<p><a href=""http://www.epsiloncamp.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.epsiloncamp.org/</a><p>where some counselors for the program, and even some STUDENTS who were of elementary school age were able to provide solutions he deemed correct. (He accepted as correct one student's Python program, noting that he doesn't know the details of Python, and I think the student's Python program would actually only print from 1 to 99, because of how Python indexes. But that would still be considered very well done in the hiring screen.) One of the counselors reproduced his model C code on the spot, taking less than three minutes to write it down with pencil and paper.<p>AFTER EDIT: Responding to the second-submitted top-level comment,<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4603819"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4603819</a><p><i>How could it be that one place is asking for that and turning him down with a working solution while another place is so desperate they just require a for-loop?</i><p>I think what is going on in the story I heard being contrary to the stories you hear is that there are several echelons of jobs, and several echelons of computer science departments. The young hacker I know best had a work-sample test for an in-person interview in which the problem specification was, ""Write code to implement a four-function calculator."" He didn't have any problem with that, and thought the problem was easy. He also has NOT completed a degree in computer science, although he was pursuing one before he entered full-time employment at a different startup with a different hiring process. He is not afraid of work-sample tests, not at all. But he would (currently) be screened out of contention by requirements to possess a degree, which he does not yet have.<p>Some other workplaces, perhaps places to get a steady job (and, crucially, visa status to remain in the United States), may get a lot of applicants who have actual earned CS degrees, but who have never acquired much independent coding ability. This is an empirical question, and the question I am trying to get a reality check on here. If you asked the EASY question asked by the hiring supervisor who told me his story to every CS grad who approaches you for a job, from any college and of any current visa status, are you sure that all without exception could pass that rather relaxed coding test?",1349204448

But I'll stand behind the analogy.<p>Take a look at how 1950s professional men in Mad Men call their female coworkers ""girls."" You know what the legal context was? Women were literally a lower caste than men. Didn't have the same rights to divorce, didn't have the same rights to appear in court, didn't have the same rights to serve on juries, didn't have the same rights to take many respectable jobs, didn't have a right to equal pay for the jobs they could take, didn't have the right to stop their husbands from raping them, didn't have the same rights to inherit property. 50-year-old women were called ""girls"" by 30-year-old men because <i>the law itself treated women like servants, wards, or objects rather than independent adults.</i> And this was true throughout the United States when you, or your mother, or your grandmother was born.<p>So I do think it's similar to the kind of issues that black men have with ""boy."" But thanks for your thoughtful response, even if I disagree. I try not to rant about this stuff, and I hate that we have to cope with it all in order to have a simple conversation, but here we are. There's plenty of crappy history to go around.",1349204424

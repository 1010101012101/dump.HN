I think it is great for junior developers to read so they can get an idea of what to expect, and how to apply encapsulation and real-world OOP.<p>This book is more like the urbandictionary.com than Strunk & White, and some people get that backwards.",1217696378
265057,comment,264686,264920,0,0,rkts,,,"You don't have to program directly in an AST to do metaprogramming.  It's a trade-off: some people feel it's important to make metaprogramming as easy as possible, while others feel it's more important to have readable syntax.<p>Every Lisp dialect has some high-level syntax, e.g. quote, CL reader macros, and Arc ssyntax.  These obscure the relationship between code and the underlying AST, but the designers felt that the gain in readability was worth it.<p>How much syntax should there be?  A hard question, but I think it would be good for Lisp to move in the ""more"" direction.  Readability is one of the big problems I have with Lisp, and macros, while certainly useful, make up only a small fraction of my code.",1217696374
265055,comment,264971,265035,0,0,qqq,,,"The Government does not just help corporations. It also, frequently, hurts them. Overall, the majority of corporations would be better off if the Government mostly left them alone and stuck to the basics of maintaining law and order.<p>The Government also both helps, and hurts, everyday people, all the time. And again people would, overall, be better off if the Government did less. But that is no reason to be skeptical of the good will of the Government when it does something genuinely helpful. Even in most of the cases where Government is harmful, it <i>means well</i>.",1217696053

I find that Wicket's approach to building the UI is more closely aligned to how I work and think.<p>I've also played with the Stripes framework a bit and it seems like a nice option but I haven't done anything extensive with it yet.<p>Hibernate is my default choice for the persistence layer.  It can be a little tricky if you're tying into an existing legacy data model with a bad design.",1217695932

The hotel can, of course, bill you, but you can just dispute the charges.<p>The guest only has to convince his credit card company that there was no Roomba when he got there. Given the state of charge backs in the industry today, that would be a shoe-in. You probably could convince them there was no painting if you stole that and tried.",1217695449

265030,comment,265010,265010,0,0,waldrews,,,"There's no choice anymore - it's got to be Seam.  It's the first Java EE framework to really learn from Rails, eliminate the XML through annotations, natively support Hibernate as the ORM, and still keep the perf and tooling advantages of static typing, use the application servers for automated, efficient state management, and generally make the vast API resources of the JEE stack available.<p>On the UI side there's a lot of support for JSF components, which is good for someone like me who wants to write the backend and have the UI just work.  The Seam code generator makes pretty instant CRUD applications that go a lot further than any of the Rails auto-scaffolding apps.<p>And, if you think Java's too verbose and inelegant - there's no reason not to write much of the application in Scala or Clojure.<p>And besides, it's by Gavin King.  Gavin King made Hibernate.  I know of no ORM in any other language that approaches its feature set - though SQLAlchemy in Python is moving in that direction, and acknowledges Hibernate as inspiration.  Hibernate used to be a maintenance nightmare because of the XML; the new annotation based version keeps the power but is a lot more DRY.<p>The Java community really did a remarkable job of killing off the XML bloat in the current Java EE stack - and only within the last year or so.<p>[if anyone out there is as enthusiastic about Seam as I am, I have budget for several freelancer projects using it, some of which are actually not boring, and may evolve into startups - contact me on here]",1217693362

Awhile ago we realized that the illness is there every day, eroding our ability to be positive and enjoy life. One of the ways we deal with this is to rent funny movies. It helps, and we'd be pretty stupid to not do it because we thought we were being like stay at home moms.<p>I don't see how this is indicative of narcissism. Also, she's describing what worked for her - I don't know how you can argue with (or downplay, or whatever it is you're doing) someone's description of their own experience.<p>Last - you use the phrase ""now she's competing with x"". I have no idea why you think it's a competition in any way. She's describing techniques that worked for her. It sounds like you wanted her to radiate a smiley face, and convince it to bite her so she could develop superhuman happy powers.<p>I just don't understand your attitude.

Scheme isn't so hot either.  it's the reason i stayed away from lisp in general for a good half year until Arc came out.  it's like these languages had a chance to be pretty due to lisp's streamlined syntax... but they ruined it by using excessively verbose names and abusing the parentheses",1217693039

2068699,comment,2068105,2068599,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"<i>Unfortunatley, publishing these kind of claims prematurely help the more gullible among us to fall for ridiculous claims from psychics and others who would take advantage of them.</i><p>True. But on the other hand, publishing ridiculous claims and incorrect results is a necessary part of science.<p>When we publish only results we know to be correct, because they agree with mainstream beliefs, we introduce a bias into the scientific process. In reality, if you publish 20 experiments with p=0.05 [1], 1 of them should be incorrect. If less than 1 in 20 of your papers isn't wrong (assuming p=0.05 is the gold standard), you are not doing science.<p>You can see a perfect illustration of this when people tried to reproduce Millikan's oil drop experiment. I'll quote Feynman: <i>Millikan measured the charge on an electron...got an answer which we now know not to be quite right...It's interesting to look at the history of measurements of the charge of an electron, after Millikan. If you plot them as a function of time, you find that one is a little bit bigger than Millikan's, and the next one's a little bit bigger than that, and the next one's a little bit bigger than that, until finally they settle down to a number which is higher.<p>Why didn't they discover the new number was higher right away? It's a thing that scientists are ashamed of - this history - because it's apparent that people did things like this: When they got a number that was too high above Millikan's, they thought something must be wrong - and they would look for and find a reason why something might be wrong. When they got a number close to Millikan's value they didn't look so hard. And so they eliminated the numbers that were too far off, and did other things like that...</i><p>This is why I'm an advocate of accepting/rejecting scientific papers based solely on methodology, with referees being given no information about the conclusions and with authors being forbidden from post-hoc tweaks. You do your experiment, and if you disagree with Millikan/conclude that ESP exists, so be it. Everyone is allowed to be wrong 5% of the time.<p>[1] I'm wearing my frequentist hat for the purposes of this post. Even if you are a Bayesian, you should still publish, however.",1294178190

2068694,comment,2068051,2068214,0,0,ABrandt,,,"<i>Hmm, what other thing does this sound like?</i><p>Yes, yes, yes. Music groups are small businesses and bootstrapping is now a model that makes sense for many of them. But although there are many parallels between musicians and startups (labels are the VCs of music etc.), there are some significant differences. For example, one of the tenets of bootstrapping is the pivot. If you're not profitable, take what you've learned and change your direction. For musicians this is far more difficult I believe. Like many popular artists, DMB's success stems from their unique 'sound'. This sound is a special mixture of each members personality and is very hard to change up while still remaining genuine. Founders certainly have a similar effect on their startups product, but I believe its far easier to hire a new designer than to stop playing the music you feel in your heart.<p>tl;dr - Music is business but its also an art. There needs to be a new bootstrapping methodology tailored towards music.",1294178039

The author recommended creating a ""placeholder"" entity to be able to pass years-in-business requirement, and unfortunately, for situations where that requirement exists in the first place, a sole proprietorship is not going to fly.<p>And yes, I meant accountant's fees. You don't just have your IRS filings, you also have the state and the city which depending on your location require multiple filings plus UBT and other complications. So you have a minimum of 15 different filings (1 yearly plus 4 quarterly, times 3 for federal, state and city), and usually more. I am not sure where you live - personally, I've filed in the US, East and West coast and Midwest and it's never cost me anywhere near $75. Perhaps you and your accountant have been ignoring deductions, self-employment taxes, UBT, etc. I simply don't see how you could have a professional CPA charge $75 for all that.<p>As far DIY tax prep I think it's a waste of your time to understand all the complexities. Tax requirements change every year and sometimes mid-year... if you are a consultant, your time is best spent doing what you know.<p>(So did I understand correctly that your accountant files just one yearly form in addition to your personal taxes? That doesn't sound right. If you are not in the US, you can probably gamble on not being audited, otherwise I'd be looking for a new accountant asap, and paying him to re-file your previous years as well).",1294177985

It's the same reason I don't buy iPhone apps: because the vast majority are free.<p>There's an implicit valuation when one uses the term ""chrome extension"".

In fact, I've <i>never</i> paid for any piece of software that wasn't a game or preloaded on my system.<p>Now, I'm not everybody.  Certainly, there will be those out there who <i>would</i> be willing to pay for a Chrome extension, but I wouldn't count on them being the majority.  If you do decide to charge for it, make sure that you set a value that accurately reflects what <i>you</i> feel it is worth, rather than what might entice people to use it.  A $0.99 fee is high enough to stop most people from paying, while low enough to be pointless for you.  Consider $9.99.  I doubt that only 10% of the people who would pay $1 would pay $10.  If I'm right, you make more money by charging more.<p>As to your idea, keep in mind that Chrome is still a browser with a small market share.

No one reacts badly when they eat it if it's linked up to other amino acids, but when it's running around free it causes reactions in some people.<p>A largish dose of free glutamic acid will trigger a migraine for me (and my dad) consistently. It's anecdotal, but I'm confident that this particular anecdote would hold up in a double-blind test.<p>Monosodium glutamate (MSG) disassociates into sodium and free glutamic acid in food; that's why it's often added. But any ingredient that contains broken up protein can be an issue; e.g. hydrolyzed soy protein or autolyzed yeast extract. MSG has a bad rep, so often foodmakers will try to slip free glutamic acid in some other way (often while shouting on the package, ""NO MSG"").<p>Food that benefits a lot from the flavor enhancer, such as canned soups, will almost always have a lot of it. Lots of stuff has _some_ amount of free glutamic acid (such as broccoli, like the article mentions) but (speaking personally), it's not enough to trigger a reaction.<p>There aren't many foods our ancestors would've eaten that contained lots of free glutamic acid. We're talking about the same molecule that serves as an excitatory neurotransmitter in your brain. It turns out that if you eat a lot of it, it's possible to get a headache (other people claim other ailments).

2068566,comment,2066552,2068161,0,0,gjm11,,,"Congratulations: you have <i>completely missed</i> the point of what I wrote.<p>1. It is possible to interpret everything I said in such a way that it doesn't insult you at all: ""I suppose you want us to think you are being honest (which is fair enough since you are being). It's interesting the way white supremacists treat others with contempt (though of course this is just an irrelevant aside and not a comment on you). Perhaps someone less stupid (than the white supremacists) would write more sensible things (than they do).""<p>2. Of course that would be a rather strained interpretation of what I wrote. That's because the insulting bits of it are implicit, not explicit: the only problem with the non-insulting interpretation is that it doesn't make any sense as a whole.<p>3. Exactly the same applies to your comments. Sure, you didn't say that black people are less intelligent than white people; you merely said that they have smaller brains and OH NOES some of them are moving to the USA, immediately after claiming that an unprecedentedly-severe ""idiocracy-like event"" is happening right now. Sure, you didn't say that one race is inferior to another; you just said a whole lot of other things that don't make much sense unless they are.<p>4. That (points 1-3 above) was the <i>whole point</i> of my paragraph to which you took such exception, as the paragraph that followed was intended to make clear. I'm sorry (though not very) that you were offended by it; I thought that was a risk worth taking in order to make sure you understood how it's possible for something to be insulting even when it can be decomposed into fragments that aren't unambiguously insulting.<p>5. I am not, as it happens, angry, no matter how much anger on my part would suit your preferred narrative about foaming-at-the-mouth politically-correct liberals. Neither does my opinion that your claim not to be being racist is pure bullshit have anything to do with ""political correctness"". But of course there's little use in my saying that, since you ""know"" what I actually think and why -- and I strongly suspect that you had decided firmly ahead of time that any possible objection to what you wrote would be a matter of being angry about a lack of ""political correctness"".<p>6. Being a white supremacist is perfectly compatible with thinking that Asian people are more intelligent than white people. (Although, as it happens, I was not in fact accusing you of being a white supremacist; see point 4 above.)<p>7. I have made no objection whatever to what Wikipedia has to say about brain size.<p>8. Your points? You've carefully left the most important ones implicit. But here's one. You say that ""mass immigration"" will lead to rapidly shrinking brain sizes in the US and Europe, because (supposedly) black people have smaller brains and (implicitly claimed) the causes of this are genetic. But there is not in fact a great deal of immigration of black people to the US, and black immigrants to the US turn out to be (as a population) extremely intelligent and well educated. For instance, see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_immigration_to_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_immigration_to_the_Unit...</a> which indicates that about half of all African immigrants to the US have an undergraduate degree and about 1/5 have graduate degrees, both figures considerably higher than those for the US population as a whole. So, with fewer than a million African immigrants in the US in total (so presumably at most, say, 50k/year), and these being apparently smarter on average than the population they're migrating into, we're supposed to be worried about a drastic loss of brain size in the US population as a result? Pull the other one, it's got bells on. (There is more migration from Africa to Europe than to the US, unsurprisingly; statistics seem harder to come by.)",1294176311

And most parents come to understand that.<p>First piece of complexity.  We don't want kids to just follow the rules.  We want them to understand them.  Which means that you don't just train them to follow your rules, you need to explain your rules.<p>Second piece of complexity.  Small kids have non-obvious needs around learning about boundaries by crossing them repeatedly.  It is not as simple as ""the kid is behaving badly"".  This is a necessary learning process.  Therefore you need to deliberately set up boundaries that you expect to be violated repeatedly.  Crossing those should have very reliable consequences (this helps the kid learn where the boundary is), but not serious ones.<p>Third complication.  Adults have limits as well.  As much as we might wish we were perfectly patient people whose tempers never fray, we aren't.  And kids will discover those buttons.

It did: Slide offered me a full-time but I declined.<p>At the end of the summer I had huge takeaways:<p>- I knew I wanted to start a company. Immediately.<p>- I knew grad school didn't matter out in California<p>- I didn't realize it at the time but I grew a huge network of fellow Slide people (""Slide"" mafia). Some of these people are my closest friends now.<p>- I learned so much about product, working with others, and how real companies ""do it.""<p>- I learned smaller things like: git, python, vim, etc.<p>- I could've never built Mixpanel without having been at Slide first.<p>If you're looking for a similar experience to my own, Mixpanel can provide this. \nApply for an internship: http://mixpanel.com/internships/ or jobs@mixpanel.com<p>Sincerely,<p>Suhail Doshi<p>Founder",1294174999

This is something I touched on in another comment: if you're known for breaking a certain type of social convention than you can often times get away with it, without much criticism.<p>So this was probably normal to his blog readers but confusing to those of us who were exposed to it for the first time.<p>Thanks for the explanation.

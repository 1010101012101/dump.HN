I did some serious wilderness time and it took about six years to settle down into a new zone.<p>This was the trigger for me: (1) I had a development career where I tried to build every application centred around databases; (2) I now had enough experience under my belt to join the dots on where this ended up, and to see that this was futile. But I wasn&#x27;t able to see past my everything-is-a-hammer.<p>There is a technique I took a lot of value from in moving on, and I still use it most days. It is this: think hard, ten times, about a problem that is tickling you. I went through a notation phase, but now I just type out my stream of conscious into a text document.<p>In the past, I would have spent a year building the first thing that came into my house. Now I can consider a large number of ideas, and have context for judging them to be good or bad ideas. The first thing I invest development energy in is significantly better than it would otherwise have been.<p>It&#x27;s cool too in that you don&#x27;t need to be at your desk to do it. You can be in a restaurant, or sitting on the beach, or on the bus, or on an exercise bike. My favourite spot at the moment is lying on a couch. The good thing about doing it away from your desk is it takes away the pressure to rush through the uncertainty.<p>&quot;choreographing 3 enterprise systems to work together&quot;<p>How do you think about message-passing between them? Why do you do it that way? Think ten times about different approaches you could use. You could use the exercise to force you to question your passive assumptions. You may find that you are scared by uncertainty. Your subsconscious could choose to fix on something familiar, than to admit that it does not know. All the more reason to do this away from your desk. Take a walk.<p>Feel free to ping me via my account email if you want to discuss your situation in more detail.",1441547683

Tipping systems require someone to <i>think</i> about whether they want to tip.<p>The alternative is what I call &quot;microsubscription&quot;: a middleman takes a single fixed subscription, then distributes on behalf of users. Examples include Amazon Underground, Apple Music, Spotify, Netflix, Google Contributor and so on.<p>Where these fall down is that they&#x27;re walled or semi-walled gardens. They don&#x27;t really work on the open web, users have to be funnelled through some central pipeline for reliable tracking of usage.<p>Which is understandable: open web schemes up until now have had the problem of fraud. Manageable but potentially fatally expensive and offputting.<p>I&#x27;m interested in this problem space for two reasons. First, advertising sucks. It distorts the vision that the early internet held out. We got linkbait and exploitatively addictive web design instead.<p>Second, I solved the problem of reliably tracking visits to websites on the open web (patent granted in Australia, pending in the USA). As a side effect, the same protocol can be used in apps, games, API calls -- anything that has a network request-response system with some kind of command channel (especially headers). Plus it can seamlessly integrate with paywalls.<p>Of the microsubscription providers already in service, the one I worry about most is Blendle, because it presents no upfront mental barrier to consumption. On the other hand, it&#x27;s another walled garden. We&#x27;ll see.",1441547596

Instead, you will receive an invoice with the product - so you don&#x27;t pay until you have it. Furthermore, they&#x27;ll give you 30 day credit, and can even split the payment over several months (3, 6, 12, 24 or 36) for an extra fee.<p>It&#x27;s pretty easy to pay by installments. You get the invoice with the full amount to pay.

I was admittedly careful to buy supported hardware.  2D acceleration just worked as far as I could tell.  Nobody I knew ever had a problem with it at all.<p>I started using 3D acceleration when Compiz/Beryl was released (2006) with an NVidia card.  I was playing World of Warcraft under wine at that time too.  The only problem I had was when I updated the kernel I had to remember to recompile the drivers under Debian.  I switched to Ubuntu for that reason (because then I didn&#x27;t have to do anything).<p>Eventually I retired that and went with an Intel board.  It worked 100% but was dog slow at the time (pre-2010 Intel drivers were quite good at 2D acceleration but abysmal for speed at 3D).  Compiz worked perfectly, the only problem was a pretty big hit in frame rate for WoW.<p>I replaced that with a Radeon Card which worked perfectly under Catalyst.  I started hearing rumours that the free software drivers were getting good performance numbers and switched to that.  2D was amazing (dramatically better than Catalyst) and 3D was slightly slower, but comparable.<p>Finally replaced that with a few laptops running Intel hardware again.  By this time (2012) the 3D performance had dramatically improved and I&#x27;m quite happy with it.  Obviously not a gamer set up, but more than adequate for casual gaming.<p>Before 2006, I think you were pretty much stuck with Nvidia and proprietary drivers if you wanted 3D.  Again, I never heard anyone who had real problems other than recompiling the drivers if you were on a distro that didn&#x27;t do it for you.<p>I actually worked with Gavriel State at Corel before he started up TransGaming.  I thought he was completely nuts to do it because at the time there was almost nothing that ran under Wine properly.  That was 2001.  Honestly, if you were trying to get 3D working on Linux, you were mostly doing it just to say you did it.<p>I&#x27;m not going to deny that some people had problems with video cards.  I often had to jump through hoops to get random hardware at work to give me nice displays.  But if you were careful to buy supported hardware, there were very few problems.<p>To be fair, I did a lot of Windows development in the late 90s and early 2000s and I had at least as many problems with video drivers under Windows.  The difference was that on Linux I would have trouble with new hardware, while with Windows I would have trouble with old hardware.  The other big difference is that with Linux, you could almost always get <i>something</i> to work so that you could hack on it.  With Windows, getting to a point where you could download updated drivers could be unbelievably painful.",1441546455

The relevant question is, how does that compare to, say, a Gen X student? We have plenty of archival evidence for that. One such is this newspaper article from 1988, titled &quot;Students pay a high price for college textbooks&quot; at <a href=""https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=19881110&id=qvpNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=fIsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7074,1871947&hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=19881110&id=...</a> .

Thus, colleges could justify price hikes by saying it would lead to a better jobs in the future, which could pay off the increased debt. Where Boomers could work for the summer to pay off a year of school, modern students must pay back loans for the next decade.<p>But that has relatively little to do with the price of textbooks.

From<p><pre><code>    ```
    if bool_var then true else false
    ```

, to theses functions-written-as-classes, or even, depending on the language you use, function that wraps other functions disguised as operators<p><pre><code>    ```
    map(function add(x, y) { return x + y }, list)

Years ago when the first PSP came out things were different. I bought the PSP just because I saw there was a rather complete SDK available for it (also made available by hacking around and reverse engineering IIRC, but at least it was more than enough to write actual applications): it included access to buttons, sockets/wifi, raw framebuffer access etc. Which led to the availability of fun things like a working VNC client which was super impressive to me back then (remember that&#x27;s like 5 years before the first iPad). I had only like one game which I never really played but instead I spent hours writing mini games and setting up communication between the PSP and a PC, using it as remote control and whatnot.",1441545020

But the problem is this: much of the time that goes into writing these books is made possible through taxpayers’ money. And who buys these books? Well, university libraries – and they, too, are paid for by taxpayers. Meanwhile, the books are not available for taxpayers to read – unless they have a university library card.<p>In the US, taxpayers are said to be spending $139bn a year on research, and in the UK, £4.7bn. Too much of that money is disappearing into big pockets.</i><p>What is this garbage?  Why not let an interesting article about a specific problem (academic publishing scams) stand on its own?   Why pour on sensationalized, over-simplified, misleading &quot;context?&quot;<p>According to to study where those numbers came from, the $139bn the federal government spends on &quot;research&quot; is a part of a larger pool of &quot;funding for research&quot; that includes non-government sources, which is like $450bn.  Universities (not just the libraries) are getting about $60bn <i>from the big pool</i>.<p>In other words:  the study, at least the results referenced by The Guardian article, does not say ANYTHING about the flow of money from taxpayer wallets to university libraries.   Based on the evidence presented, the fraction of university library funding from taxpayer dollars could be anywhere from 0% to 100%.

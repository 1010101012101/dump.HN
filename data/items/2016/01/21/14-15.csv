For example, you simply list the Itti/Baldi paper&#x27;s abstract and say that, basically, because the word &#x27;priming&#x27; doesn&#x27;t appear in the abstract means the research has nothing to do with it. That seems incredibly disingenuous to me. The research is directly about predicting where human eyeballs will involuntarily move when presented with certain visual stimuli. If you can&#x27;t see the direct connection with drawing attention to priming artifacts in an ad, I think it&#x27;s probably just not possible for us to even converse about the topic at all.<p>The rest of the reply is similar. Using ctrl-f to search for the word &#x27;priming&#x27; in a source doesn&#x27;t constitute an effort to see how it could be connected to priming.",1453388398

So in order to add a mass-term it must be generated by a dynamical field -- the Higgs field -- such that those symmetries are still respected. Hence, the Higgs is able to give the mass-terms to the fermions.<p>However, the neutrinos are not like the other fermions. Fermions can have different chirality, but the neutrino only has one chirality. Due to the neutrinos being different, the Higgs field needs to be different in order to also generate mass-terms to the neutrinos (or another mechanism than the Higgs-mechanism must be used).

While the jury is still out about a lot of things, there are major reasons why the NHS in Britain discourages expectant mothers from having private &quot;4D&quot; scans and additional procedures.<p>This is an overstatement of the available evidence. The link you post says so itself:<p>> These studies have found no evidence that ultrasound affects mortality around the time of pregnancy or birth, or has any effect on childhood cancers. In randomised-controlled trials there has been ‘weak evidence’ that it may affect whether a child is right or left handed (known as handedness), which the reviewers say may be the result of confounding, rather than actual causation.<p>I cringe when I read well-meaning but irrelevant warnings like the one you gave. To me, these warnings are somewhere between naysaying and spreading FUD. The NHS wants to make sure that millions of people don&#x27;t take unnecessary ultrasounds, since a tiny risk, multiplied by millions, equals a few unnecessary deaths/left-handed children. The individual risk of unnecessary ultrasounds, however, is extremely low compared to the usual risks of pregrancy and childbirth.<p>Many medical devices are unnecessarily expensive (and suprisingly badly designed, from a user-interface standpoint). There are already enough regulatory hurdles in place that prevent disruption of the medical device markets, let us not add to these hurdles by being overly cautious!",1453386996

The author interviews a tiny handful of mediocre college students who blame their &quot;color&quot; for not getting hired right out of school by big, glamorous tech companies.  Are we supposed to be sympathetic?<p>I remember my own struggles to break into the tech business, many years ago now.  Although white and &quot;privileged&quot;, i.e. no cultural barriers to entry, I found it very tough and had to jump through hoops, work my way up from semi-tech to actual development positions.  I took night school courses on a credit card and got into debt. I bought whatever gear I could afford and stayed up until 3am writing code, then got up and went to my menial job.<p>The opportunities didn&#x27;t just fall in my lap; I had to earn them.  No glamorous technology titans came knocking on my door, begging me to come interview.  I had to work for everything I got, and God, it was hard.  It still is.<p>This same work ethic applied to everyone; I was on the chatboards in the late 80s, all through the 90s, and the 2000s, and the story is always the same.  You have to have the right stuff if you want to build a career in technology -- be smart, creative, have some initiative, humility, humor, etc.<p>So maybe Black Americans don&#x27;t get that in their upbringing.  Maybe they&#x27;re not taught to be smart, competitive, hard charging over achievers.  Maybe they&#x27;re not encouraged to be creative, to think outside the box, etc.  I don&#x27;t know.  What I do know is, you can&#x27;t compensate for that by handing people undeserved opportunities.<p>Affirmative action is a failure; it&#x27;s nothing but a form of welfare.

(Short answer: yes)<p>> I would be very surprised if banks simply decided to voluntarily step back from a system that will enable them to have more control over the US economy than the federal government.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever heard this more accurately or succinctly put. In this megathread, here on HN, everyone thinks it&#x27;s about banks wanting money. From working with banks on this for nearly 5 years, this isn&#x27;t true. They&#x27;re fighting for relevancy, the status quo. They&#x27;ve had control over this system since the 70s and have built fortification after fortification (through regulation, technology, etc.) to protect themselves from the whims of trending market forces.<p>But you remember in Rocky 4, when Rocky made Ivan Drago (the invincible super-soldier) bleed? (source: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VefZwIhCdqI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VefZwIhCdqI</a>) It showed Balboa that Ivan was human, had vulnerabilities. The match shifted after that.<p>The fear Ivan felt is exactly how financial institutions feel now. New market entrants (see: Apple, Stripe, BTC, Dwolla), regulatory uncertainty (CFPB, Dodd-Frank, etc), and changing customer expectations (real-time communication, uberization, etc) have shown banks that they&#x27;re no longer unaffected to the whims and trends of consumer innovation.<p>This is why they&#x27;re at the table (despite torpedoing Same-Day ACH in 2011). They&#x27;re choosing the least worst of two options: have the Fed step-in with a mandate (could get from congress in the next 2 years) or inform the next infrastructure of the US economy.<p>The good news is that this time, unlike in the 70s, it&#x27;s not just banks designing the system. Fed Fast Task Force is comprised of consumer groups, retailers, innovative tech companies (including Dwolla, Ripple, and many more), regulators, academics, and many more. We may not have as many cards as we think, but we&#x27;ve been able to influence some pretty key decisions.<p>Also, banks aren&#x27;t always the villians we make&#x27;em out to be. Behind those logos are real people that really want a better payment system, not just to protect their bottom-line but because they want something better for their families, neighbors, and (selfishly) themselves. We&#x27;ll get lapped by other economies if we don&#x27;t (See: 37 other nations with or creating a real-time system). They&#x27;re fighting hard to make the best system possible, given their constraints (fraud, liability, existing regulation, and, yes, their P&L).",1453386002

In other words, my understanding of the stock market will influence my opinions about the angel investing and startup market en masse, but it would not be anything more than one factor in my opinion about a single company I could invest in.<p>While it&#x27;s true that companies with strong fundamentals do fail in a downturn, companies with strong fundamentals can fail for any number of reasons. Just as I&#x27;m not all that concerned with my Vanguard funds going down for a while because they&#x27;ll be back up in 10 years, I&#x27;m not too worried about a single company with strong fundamentals getting caught with its shorts down when the tide goes out.

That has never influenced my decision to fund a company.</i><p>It probably will as things start to slow down.<p>During the growth phase of the business cycle, many companies do well. Even some with poor fundamentals that shouldn&#x27;t. This is the danger of stimulus - it promotes an inefficient and wasteful allocation of resources. But it makes investing easier as a larger pool of companies are succeeding and finding exits for their founders and investors through IPOs and acquisitions, which are both very closely correlated with the health of the stock market.<p>During the contraction phase, the companies with poor fundamentals are exposed. Ok, no loss there, they were struggling and nobody <i>really</i> believed in their potential anyways. But contractions can also bring down good, solid companies who were just caught unaware and were not holding enough liquid assets to pay their employees and the interest on their debts. Some non-negligible percentage will not make it through a rocky period while liquidity dries up and relatively cheap funding/investing slows down.<p>I think it&#x27;s smart to not read too much into the stock market as it can be distracting and noisy, but I think its trajectory and what it indicates about the phase and timing of the next business peak/trough cycle is extremely important and should not be discounted.",1453385314

Stakeholders in the new system, the ones that put up the money to build and support the system (Financial Institutions, providers, etc), will need to find a way to compensate themselves for their investment and prove to their share holders the fiduciary value of doing so.<p>From there, there are three factors that will most influence pricing.<p>1) Scale: how many transactions the system as a whole will process? We&#x27;re all familiar with Wires and how expensive they&#x27;re compared to ACH. That&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t have the critical mass or number of transaction ACH does. The more transactions on the system, the less financial burden the system has to assess on the end-users. \n2) Market forces: How providers will price their services all depends on the market and their target customers. You mention stripe&#x27;s percentage model, that&#x27;s their business decision. Dwolla, a counterpoint, offers a flat fixed monthly model. The intelligence that formed the pricing models is what makes the free market so powerful.\n3) Fraud: How this system mitigates fraud (through tokenization, improved fraud sharing among participants, better authorization practices, etc.) will greatly influence how much financial burden is passed on to us, the consumer. Good news is that we&#x27;re starting over. LOTS OF POTENTIAL HERE!",1453384807

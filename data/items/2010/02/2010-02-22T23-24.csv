They told us we had to spend a lot of time writing up business/financial models, including 5-year plans(!?!). As a result, we spent very little time developing and iterating on the actual product. We had a feeling this didn't make much sense, as our idea evolved every day or so, and thus so did the business 'plan'.

1144123,comment,1143786,1143786,0,0,pyre,,,"I think that the crux of their argument is that if people are 'used' to getting software for free it will erode their perception of software being something that you pay for, and in general, erode people's willingness to pay for other types of intellectual property.<p>But at it's most basic level this argument boils down to, ""if you use company X's product, then you might not see any value in company Y's product; therefore company X's product should be banned because it is limiting the marketplace."" In this case, they are painting things with a broader stroke by seemingly bringing up some sort of 'Open Source' vs 'Closed Source' argument, but the main point still stands. They are saying that because Open Source takes away profits from Closed Source companies that it must be eliminated, which is ludicrous.<p>They may put on a veneer, of claiming that they just want a level playing field, but it seems to me that they just don't want anyone inside of the government to have a preference against them (or be a champion for their competitors). Why? Not because of some sort of free-market-lets-join-hands-and-sing Libertarian nonsense. They feel that they can win government contracts when there is no one speaking out for Open Source because then their sales people don't have any competition when marketing their products to the government.",1266882868

They can piggyback on those to restrict adult apps even further.<p>Furthermore, the comment you replied to is mentioning a problem that is rampant in the entire store, which prompted Apple to do things like banning developers with thousands of near-identical apps (that I'm sure we can agree is abuse) and creating another category for books (remember those idiots that would upload 99 cent public domain ebooks?).

1144098,comment,1137669,1138402,0,0,jekyllnhyde,,,"A court has the power to strike down laws for a variety of reasons.  Only CRIMINAL laws tend to be held to the standard of review you are referring to.  A few torts will be as well (for example Assault or Battery civil laws.)  But generally to be more accurate you would need to say that the law CAN be struck down if the INTENDED CLASS is able to neither determine its meaning NOR guess it from their experience.  Courts will do anything they can to uphold a statute.<p>BUT the above discussion is both correct and incorrect.  A trial court can strike down a law that has not previously been ruled on by a higher court.  So if the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on it no other court in the country can do anything about it ever. (more or less.  They might rule around it or strike it down on different grounds.)  If the U.S. Supreme court hasn't ruled on it then the court is free.  It is more complicated than that because the relation between state and federal courts is being ignored here.<p>For the most part laws are only struck down for being unconstitutional for one reason or another.  You are referring to when a law is ""unconstitutionally vague.""<p>Finally - The American Common Law tradition specifically comes from English Common Law.  Continental Europe used, and still uses, the Civil Code system which is based on Roman and then Napoleonic Codes.",1266882189

A client should never feel that coming to a lawyer is something at all costs to be avoided unless and until he is prepared to pay in blood.<p>Now this is a thoughtful piece and I am not saying that this is the tenor of the argument.<p>But all or nothing is not the way to approach your company formation legal issues.<p>First, <i>as early on as possible</i>, you should meet with a good lawyer in the startup field to get a <i>strategic perspective</i> on the legal issues. What are the legal goals you need to accomplish? How do you best go about them? What are the likely costs of different ways of going about the process? Is there a fixed-fee package that make sense for your goals? This type of initial meeting might be introductory and general (and free) or might get into all the specifics of your case (in which it would likely cost you something, but not much).<p>If you are a sole founder, do the quickie incorporation and be done with it, as soon as possible. In that situation, it is not an issue of ""doing it right"" because you can pretty much stumble along blind and still get it basically right for the simple legal issues involved.<p>If you are part of a founding team, and need to impose vesting on founder stock, file 83(b) elections, capture IP via assignment agreements, set up equity incentives for key people, etc., then do not wait to shop this around to knowledgeable law firms. If what you hear is rigid and expensive, then perhaps you should wait but doing so carries its own risks. I think what you will find, though, is that you can get a knowledgeable lawyer to do this sort of more sophisticated package on reasonable terms, sometimes as low as $2K or $3K for legal fees if the founding team is reasonably sophisticated and does not need a lot of hand-holding.<p>If you shop it around and don't get the right quotes, then you can make a conscious decision to say, ""I know I might need this but I will take the risks and wait in order to stretch my dollars."" If you have gotten a strategic perspective from an initial meeting, and done the shopping, then you will make such a decision based on a careful analysis of the issues involved, giving each of the trade-offs their due weight.<p>Perhaps this is all another way of saying just what the author does (""hold off until you have the cash to spare"") but perhaps you really do have the cash earlier rather than later if, by following these simple steps, you discover it really is not such an expensive process to ""do it right"" for your circumstances right up front.",1266881744

This was done on a real site with considerable traffic 50 to 100 php pages/second.  This has been in production on the site for at least a year.<p>So in the real world, if a user click on a link to your site, the time to complete the load of the full html page (lets say a 22k page) is reduced to a single RTT instead or 4 RTT. 
To test that it's doing the correct thing you can verify with a packet analyzer or you can even see the results on something like firebug.  Even if you consider RTT times of 50ms to 100ms it is still considerable difference to have the page complete the load in 100ms vs 400ms.
Especially if you have script at the bottom of your page (say google analytics and such) this means that these requests start that much sooner, the page completed rendering sooner, etc.<p>In addition to the faster loading time there is another benefit to this.<p>In a busy server your best friend is the ability to process connection quickly.  If you have to have a connection open for 4RTT vs 1RTT that starts to make a difference.  Implementing this you release the process and connection to TIMEWAIT right away instead of tying up a valuable php process.",1266879650

21054,comment,20249,20923,0,0,BrandonM,,,"It's a good thing that union organizers are in no real danger anymore, and companies allow a fair negotiation process between workers and the corporate offices who determines their pay.<p>Oh, wait...<p><a href=""http://killercoke.org/crimes.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://killercoke.org/crimes.htm</a><p><a href=""http://www.wakeupwalmart.com/facts/#anti-union"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wakeupwalmart.com/facts/#anti-union</a><p>
An article about the double standard applied to unions vs. corpoartions:<p><a href=""http://www.tpmcafe.com/blog/coffeehouse/2006/sep/24/biased_anti_union_reporting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tpmcafe.com/blog/coffeehouse/2006/sep/24/biased_anti_union_reporting</a><p>Sure, in a field where there is a high demand for workers, unions are unnecessary, because any deficiencies in pay will be punished.  In manufacturing and retail, however, where the demand is not as high, there has to be someone out there establishing a minimum standard for their employees to receive in compensation for their work.  Since minimum wage in the U.S. is not enough to live on, the only other groups with the possibility to enforce such standards are unions.<p>I think that the recent trend (as in the last couple decades) of discounting the importance of unions is in large part due to comparing dissimilar organizations.  Manufacturing and retail is a completely different beast from the service industry, and to lump them all into one ""unions fight for overcompensation"" group is shameful.",1178809125

It has yet another version of SICP, plus several other useful bits.  The videos can be had on DVD for $75 or downloaded (recommended donation $0.25 per video).<p>The turnaround on the DVD is a bit slow, though.  Took me about three weeks to get mine (I don't mind, but you asked for ""fastest"" and that would slow you down).",1178807913

If I have a good (human) assistant, I can ask him or her to find me all the Y Combinator articles and it just works. I don't need to write some formal mathematical description of the task.<p>It's true that it's all math/physics/chemistry underneath, due to how the brain works, but in practice we never worry about that, just as an engineer doesn't generally consider quantum and relativistic effects when he's designing a bridge, or an outfielder doesn't scribble down a bunch of differential equations before catching a fly ball.<p>Sure, any standard computer is equivalent to a bounded Turing machine, but Turing machines are a real pain in the ass to program. <p>Mathematical purity is one thing. Getting your work done is quite another.<p>Over-mathematization is what killed AI (IMO).",1178807892

21041,comment,21022,21023,0,0,Tichy,,,"Learning by doing is the only way in my opinion. You could start with (X)HTML - think about something you could make a web page about, for example a homepage for your grandmother. Then start thinking about some dynamic content to add to the web page, for example a guestbook (for the server programming route), or fancy animations in JavaScript or Flash. Try to find your way by reading tutorials on the web.<p>The thing about programming/hacking is that it is not a fixed set of skills. Rather, first you think about what you want to achieve, then you start researching on how to do it. There is never an end to it, therefore just reading a book doesn't cut it. You might be a versatile Perl programmer, but suddenly you'll find that you want Ajax in your next web application, so you learn about that. ",1178805778

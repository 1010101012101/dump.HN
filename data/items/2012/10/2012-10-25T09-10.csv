The fundamental challenge we faced was that this announcement - at this time - is not targeted at developers.  The ""gushing market-speak"" and press release language were intended for a specific audience. Based on the companies who contacted us to learn more about Ameche yesterday, it appears we reached our specific target market as we desired.<p>We will have a more in-depth, technology and developer focused Ameche announcement and release at a later time.<p>You mentioned ""In the past, I've [used] Voxeo IVR platforms..."" and I wanted to comment on that.<p>Voxeo's IVR platform (Prophecy) is recognized by Gartner and Datamonitor as industry leading.  Prophecy is used in the largest IVR deployments in the world (more than 50,000 ports for a single customer application) and the smallest (single-line micro-banking applications in Africa).<p>Voxeo is also extremely customer focused.  We have a reputation for being so that is shown by our customer retention rate (over 99%) and customer satisfaction scores.<p>I and everyone else at Voxeo are extremely interested in improving Prophecy and our other products in any way possible.  If you have any specific criticism of our platforms or our documentation I'd love to hear it.  I'll pay you for your time to talk with us about the things you disliked.  Please let me know if you'd be up for that.  You can reply here or contact me via @visionik on Twitter.<p>Thanks again,<p>-Jonathan (Chairman of Voxeo)",1351158510

So I'd like to add the following:<p>The Scratch programming environment, being the most child-friendly system I've ever seen so far (and I have tried to teach children, as well as adults with zero prior programming experience, using environments as different from each other as StarLogo and Python), lets children create amazing programs, but most important of all introduce the fundamentals of computational thinking and creativity with almost zero barriers for entry. From a programming perspective it definitely has a lot of shortcomings (most of which have been addresses by 'add-on's or similar systems built on top of it) but if you want to show the basics to a bunch of kids who are 7 or 8 year olds, then it is a great system.<p>Moreover, the social aspects of Scratch, namely easily publishing your projects and seeing the source code of others, are a gift. Try to do the same with Python and GitHub (one of my favorite combinations when I'm not dealing with children ;-), starting from scratch (some pun intended) and showing them all the tools... I'm curious how far their attention span would go.<p>Finally, apparently a number guessing game can be super easily implemented with a 'fake programming language' such as Scratch, too: <a href=""http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/emres/2859373"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/emres/2859373</a><p>And the source code, plain and simple, is probably easier to explain to children (and I had kids create much more complex games, animations, quizzes, etc. with Scratch): <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/64416865@N00/8121602786/in/photostream"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/64416865@N00/8121602786/in/phot...</a><p>PS: For a nice account of Scratch from a veteran compile developer please see: ""Teach children planning and problem solving not programming"" <a href=""http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2012/09/20/teach-children-planning-and-problem-solving-not-programming/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2012/09/20/teach-...</a>",1351158280
4696961,comment,4694776,4695891,1,0,pron,,,"Web browsers are not the best fit for Java because they require short startup times and must do their best not to waste too much RAM. Linux is an OS, requires predictability, and also must not waste RAM. Compilers certainly require fast startup, and might not even run long enough for the JVM optimizations to kick in.<p>Java has many advantages, and speed is chief among them, but memory footprint certainly isn't.<p>And I'm not sure how you can say that the software you mention beats Java (let alone easily). You have nothing to compare it to. Those programs' requirements preclude Java before any speed considerations are taken. If you can't spare lots of RAM, and don't have the time to wait for the JIT to profile and compile your code, Java isn't for you. But if you just want speed for an always-online application - especially if it requires serious concurrency - I'd say Java would be a better choice than C++, performance-wise, 9 times out of 10.<p>If I were to pick an example to try and disprove my statement, I would actually choose Oracle or MySQL.

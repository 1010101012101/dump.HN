To use the cliche, he could not beat them so he joined them.  IV is essentially a patent law firm that is its own client, or a company legal department minus the company; it was initially funded out of his own pocket.  In my experience very few business people like lawyers or litigation and no sensible business person would have been inclined to invest millions in an idea like IV.   But a man with Microsoft money and a grudge to settle with the world of patents and patent lawyers... anything is possible when you have that much cash.  Some guys build failed music museums shaped like melting guitars[1], others start acquiring low quality patents en masse, forming short-lived shell companies with cryptic names and threatening innovators with patent litigation.<p>Now that they are bringing in revenue a business person might see things differently; maybe IV looks like a sensible investment.  But trolling is still trolling.  As with a law firm, they rely on the patent system to make money yet they produce nothing.  They rely on fear of litigation to drive their ""business"".  How long can they keep up the charade?<p>1. Interestingly, he's no stranger to frivolous patent litigation either.

But when it comes time for a country to do the same thing - everyone disagrees and says what is needed is for the original bondholders to be made whole by issuing new debt.    There is not some miracle line where obvious solutions jump over to being wrong based on size.  Defaulting on payments is a scalable strategy, from the underwater home owner to the overly-indebted bank to the hopelessly over-borrowed national government.  It's not pleasant for anyone involved, but confronting the problem is far better than trying to sweep it under the carpet.<p>There has arisen a pervasive myth that only debtors should lose when creditors are unable to keep a loan performing.  For sure, the rights of the creditor exceed that of the debtor, but it's plain wrong to expect a creditor not to suffer losses when extensive bad loans are found.<p>The problem is that, by being locked into the Euro,  Ireland was unable to use the shock-absorber of a floating exchange rate.  People rightly dumped their Icelandic currency, because they got burnt.  The Icelandic people lost a lot of wealth.  The Icelandic government rightly stripped the banks of their independence.  But now the decks are cleared and people can get back to working and being productive, and getting their economy growing again.<p>Why people will continue to insist that the best measure for an indebted government is to borrow more money and hope for a miracle of growth to fix the payments is beyond me.<p>The only result from drunkenness is a hangover.  You can resume drinking to postpone the symptoms, but they will always arrive, and the further you push it out, the worse it gets.",1355986466

4946492,comment,4945181,4946038,6,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">I see, ""troll"" because I don't conform to your opinion.<p>No, ""troll"" because you're trolling. Make an argument that isn't a textbook logical fallacy.<p>>About as provable as the opposite.<p>Are you arguing semantics? Absolute proof of anything is impossible? The thing to be proven is insufficiently specified, e.g. whether limited to software patents or to historically vs. in today's economy? That sort of thing? That's extremely pedantic, but I suppose it's technically correct. (The best kind of correct, naturally.)<p>So let's say not proof, just good reasoning supporting the position. Here, I'll start.<p>In the software industry where every individual with a PC and a compiler is a market participant, there are thousands of times more players than there are in most other patent-intensive industries, which vastly increases the cost of the patent system because the cost of clearing and licensing each invention against each patent is O(n^2) in the number of inventions. This number is so large in a market with tens or hundreds of thousands of participants that actually doing the clearances and licensing becomes an impossibility in practice due solely to transaction costs, i.e. the cost of each and every inventor tracking down and negotiating with each and every other inventor holding a potentially relevant software patent.<p>Moreover, as a result of the practical impossibility of actually doing that many clearances, it creates an environment in which everyone is potentially infringing everything. In such an environment, the patent system is inherently not providing the expected incentive to inventors, because there are too many infringers infringing too many patents to even so much as evaluate all of the possible infringement, much less negotiate licenses or litigate it, resulting in no license fees (or monopoly rents through the ability to exclude) from the large majority of infringers.<p>In addition to that, because patents are legally required to be licensed but software cannot rigorously and thoroughly be determined to be non-infringing in any cost-effective manner, an enormous amount of uncertainty about what patents a product may infringe overhangs the prospective market participants, which reduces the amount of funding available for new R&D because prospective investors will only provide funding if the expected returns exceed the risk created by software patents. Worse, because of the enormous amount of <i>de jure</i> infringement which is <i>de facto</i> business as usual, patent trolls with submarine patents can do an enormous amount of damage to anyone who experiences market success, and there is nothing the victim can do to prevent it because of the aforementioned practical impossibility of doing all the necessary patent clearances. This is worse than a normal risk because it occurs exactly to those investments which would otherwise have succeeded, providing an even more powerful disincentive to invest in new product development. The associated litigation creates a further deadweight loss on the economy because not only are those resources not being allocated to research, they're actively being misallocated to wasteful litigation and transaction costs.<p>On top of all of that, the reverse can occur and results in a potentially even larger harm: Rather than a successful company being sued by a non-practicing troll, the successful company can sue anyone who actually makes a product, because they hold enough patents that any nontrivial software infringes some of them. Between large companies this power cancels out, but when the relationship is asymmetric it becomes a club for incumbents to use against newcomers. Anyone who enters an established market segment is subject to suit by incumbents, which reduces the incentive for non-incumbents to innovate, because the cost of the inevitable litigation has to be factored in. Where this effect is sufficiently strong, it can destroy innovation entirely in specific submarkets, because no newcomers enter for fear of incumbents with patents and no incumbents innovate for lack of competition from newcomers.<p>So there you go.

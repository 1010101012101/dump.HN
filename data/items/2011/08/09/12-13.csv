Try uploading a thousand photos to Flickr without culling, organizing into albums, tagging and captioning, and see what your result looks like.  It doesn't have to be like that.<p>Second, they have to be your photos for you to appreciate chronological organization.

Meet David Beers from S&P...",http://chaselanc.com/post/8672903978,"It turns out the worlds most powerful man is not a world leader, not an elected official and not a billionaire businessman.  If you want to find out who can crash international markets and provoke the loss of trillions of dollars by erasing one letter (A), look no further than David Beers, Global Head of Sovereign Ratings at S&P.  The aftermath of S&Ps downgrade to the U.S. credit rating was scary.  On Monday, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 6.7% and 5.6%, respectively.  All stocks in the S&P 500 retreated for the first time since at least 1996  and the indexs 10 main groups fell more than 5.3%.  So who is this David Beers guy?  While most have never heard his name before, he is well known by virtually every finance minister in the world.  He is a Wall Street veteran and graduated from the London School of Economics.  Beyond that, David Beers background and biography is a mystery to most.<p>But whats more of a mystery to most people is the power and relevance of the S&P, or more broadly, the collective group of rating agencies.  Its difficult to fathom how these companies have the authority to shake the global economy like this.  Their role is very similar to a credit bureau that hands out scores to households and individuals seeking loans.   Their reputation for assessing risk has been shaky on more than one occasion.  Could this be a new blackeye for S&P?  To be certain, its going to be tough for Beers & Co. to adequately justify their recent downgrade of the U.S.  Much of the rating report submitted by S&P focused on the political dysfunction of the U.S. government as opposed to its true ability to repay its debt.  From S&Ps perspective, the question really isnt whether the U.S. can repay its debts, its whether the U.S. is willing to repay.  The political logjam from the recent debt crisis highlighted the fact that the U.S. certainly has the ability to make payments but there are many politicians who are unwilling to write the check.  And this is what the S&P is most troubled by.  While Warren Buffett thinks the U.S. deserves a ""quadruple A"" rating, the S&P is only halfway there, and that is making all the difference in the markets today.",1312893505

Ultimately an account of free will should include a definition of the concept, and an explanation of how it figures into our intuitions about particular cases. In particular it should explain situations in which the given definition conflicts with our intuitions, and obviously determinism is a big part of that.<p>The incompatibilist argument is at heart very straightforward: free will is incompatible with determinism; determinism is true; therefore free will does not exist. When pressed on the second premise, the incompatibilist can further assert that indeterminism is incompatible with free will, and that determinism and indeterminism exhaust the possibilities (this is just an instance of the law of the excluded middle). Therefore regardless of which one of them holds, free will does not exist.<p>However, even this argument requires a definition of free will, in order to demonstrate its incompatibility with (in)determinism. It thus suffers from the same 'problem' that you allege compatibilism does: the compatibilist can simply say that the incompatibilist is defining the problem into existence.<p>I'm curious to know what you think an answer which didn't suffer from the problem you outline would look like.",1312892380

Games like Asteroids and Missile Command do not need the polish others describe to be engaging, and then hosts of new features can be added over time to make such games more engaging.

More so when the package includes a 3y repurchase obligation.<p>Start with Elon Musk personally backing the repurchase agreement. Was the bank unwilling to to take this risk? Why could they believe they can't securitise the risk? Granted this is U.S. Bancorp and Wells Fargo we're talking about. Will the risk live on Tesla's balance sheet? The silver lining would be the clarity investors will get into the assumptions that went into pricing the put.<p>Why we are already talking about financing? Wasn't the plan to improve accessibility by driving down prices through increasingly mass market models? Who is the marginal customer who balked at the cash price but is shifted by this? The one who doesn't have the cash? Or couldn't get a bank loan? These customers are probably less credit-worthy than Tesla's cash customers. The repurchase agreement is a callable loan to borrowers willing to fund a large discretionary purchase with debt. This will come home to roost if U.S. growth and thus incomes tank and erstwhile enthusiastic greenies start seeing their vroom vrooms as piggie banks.<p>We know that part of what pushed Tesla into profitability was its re-working of its DoE loan. Is this a way to pull forward sales? How are these ""leases"" accounted for when they're made? I'm keeping an eye open for if they recognise the full value of the sale, less an ignomiously small loss reserve, upon signing.<p>Comparatively minor but still irking me: why is Elon Musk implying his credit is better than Tesla's? Tesla has more loss-absorbing capital. Given the amount of Musk's net worth tied up in Tesla, his credit has a high correlation with Tesla's. I get that this is more a marketing stunt, but the emptiness is disappointing. Then again, I would have probably railed at Steve Jobs in 1998, too.",1364953516

They aren't something that spontaneously arose from a deprived economic climate or a dysfunctional society. There are only a very tiny number of differences between AAVE and American Standard English that can be explained by an element of weak creolization (such as the dropping of <i>to be</i> in statements of identity and optional inversion in forming questions); the rest find exact parallels in dialects on the ground throughout Britain and Ireland. In fact, most Newfoundlanders would have little trouble with the grammar (though not necessarily the slang) of AAVE, since their native dialect derives from a very similar mixture of British and Irish dialects. While it can probably be fairly stated that the colour bar has been responsible for the isolation of the black vernacular grammar (and its failure to transition to something closer to American Standard English), it is not dissimilar to the native English dialects of the people who were once working alongside them as indentured servants rather than as slaves.<p>The idea that diglossia (or triglossia) does not exist in the mouths of educated, and even privileged speakers of English (wherever they may live) is preposterous outside of a relatively small part of the American socioeconomic strata (and by American, I mean North American  much of Canada is weirdly homogeneous as well). Most native speakers of English speak two or more ""Englishes"", each with its own grammar and vocabulary. AAVE is not a ""lesser"" dialect; despite its speakers often being disadvantaged, the language itself is no less legitimate. However, like most of us, in order to move outside of their dialectical grouping, speakers of AAVE must also have command of the prevailing standard  just like Jeff Foxworthy's redneck brain surgeon.",1364953002

5483466,comment,5482868,5483343,5,0,ggchappell,,,"> This is interesting to me because... is there even a scientific definition of depression yet? Such that, if you have a defined list of symptoms, you are definitely depressed, and if you don't, you are definitely not depressed?<p>It depends a bit on what you mean. In the U.S. at least, diagnosis of depression is generally based on the American Psychiatric Association's <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> (DSM).[1] That lists a number of disorders that would be categorized under ""depression"", including ""Major Depressive Disorder"", ""Dysthymia"", and the catchily named ""Depressive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified"".<p>In the DSM, these disorders are all treated as <i>syndromes</i>, meaning they are defined entirely by symptoms. They may have organic causes (troubles with neurotransmitters, etc.), but the <i>definition</i> of each disorder does not address that issue. This is in contrast to something like influenza, which refers to a particular organic cause (infection by a certain kind of virus).<p>As for the actual definitions, they vary in how specific they are. Major Depressive Disorder is quite specific, requiring certain kinds of episodes to occur with specified frequencies and lengths. On the other end of the scale is DD-NOS, which is essentially defined as a depression-ish thing that doesn't fit into any of the other categories. (Okay, it's a little more precise than that, but, honestly, not much.)<p>> This is not to be mistaken for saying it doesn't exist or that it's all in someone's head - it's more just to say that if someone has depression, they have something that may deserve treatment and sensitivity, but that it's something that we still do not know exactly how to describe or diagnose, and so therefore we will just call it ""depression"" in the meantime.<p>I'd say that's pretty much on target. However, biology & biochemistry are proceeding forward at a breakneck pace these days. We do have some understanding of the causes for some kinds of depression, and this understanding seems to be improving significantly each year.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Man...</a>",1364951076

The method 'get' does what it's named, to get the property now in the call.  Curry(get('age')) creates a separate entity that parameterizes get with the 'age' property.  It's a new function object different from get.  But at least the term curry(get('age')) gives some visual cue to the code readers as what it does vs just get('age').<p>For languages (e.g. Haskell) that implicitly curry everything, it's understood that any missing parameter means a curried function has been created and the actual call is deferred.  Javascript is not such language.  Mixing in the naming convention for implicit curry just causes confusion for the readers.<p>Javascript's currying is explicit with pattern such as, getter(get, 'age'), which would wrap a function around the get function with a closure {propertyName: 'age'}.<p>I think it's best to consider the audience and the convention of a language when naming things.",1364950921

But you can't expect people to be able to, or feel safe in, confronting someone who has already shown a disregard for their agency.<p>In an ideal world, it'd go something like this:<p><pre><code>    Hear ugly -> confront offender -> extract apology -> inform others
</code></pre>
But of course, for a large number of people it'll be more like this:<p><pre><code>    Hear ugly -> ensure safety of ones self and others -> inform others
</code></pre>
Merely confronting the asshat is great until you discover the asshat in question is just doing this again and again and saying sorry as if that makes their original transgression alright. There needs to be something the offending party can lose for it to make sense, especially when the potential reputation loss isn't in the circles they care about anyway.<p>And in one respect, making a change isn't my first priority. My first priority is making these places a safe place for people to be. Making the people who would otherwise make this an unsafe space rethink their actions is a secondary goal.",1364950907

If an exception is thrown, you may want to log it and the stack trace, but where? If you write to a local log file, that data will be useless unless you run some sort of log shipping or log centralization (like with scribe or kafka or syslogng). But that's usually a pain in neck to setup and you can't run storm without already running a zookeeper cluster, so if you're lazy, you just log to zookeeper.<p>Everything is fine as long as exceptions are infrequent.",1364950893

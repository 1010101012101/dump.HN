You would hand $25,000 cash to a Vancouver money changer (Hawaladar) in Vancouver, and receive code words (or an agreed signal such as a secret handshake) and a contact address in Helsinki. No actual cash moves out of Canada. Instead, when your friend gives the code to the correspondent hawaladar in helsinki, he will receive the equivalent in euros (less a commission) from money that is already there. To review:<p>-There are no written documents. The exchanges are based on mutual trust (perhaps for that reason unpopular in the United States?).<p>-Only local currencies are used.

If they were, everyone would follow them.<p>Most people don&#x27;t actually want to lose weight. Rather, they want to already have lost weight. So they look for shortcuts that will get them there. That is why there is such a massive signal-to-noise issue in the fitness world. Fad diets and magic pills are invented because people are willing to pay for them.<p>People are fat because eating is a big part of their lives. They eat several huge meals everyday, plus snacks, and often times when they are eating one meal they are dreaming about and planning their next one. On top of this, food has become a &quot;social currency&quot; for them. Being able to cook delicious, unhealthy food at a family BBQ is seen as an admirable skill, and bringing a box of donuts to the office in the morning is seen as a way to score points with coworkers.<p>In order to lose weight they need to reverse that and make <i>exercising</i> and <i>not eating</i> an equally big part of their lives. They need to count calories, watch what they eat, do heavy workouts at the gym (none of this lift-pink-dumbbells or walk-on-the-treadmill-while-texting-friends bullshit), strictly regulate their sleep and wake-up times, and more. It is NOT supposed to be easy. It is supposed to be HARD. And as with all hard endeavors, success is a matter of discipline. Unfortunately most people don&#x27;t have that.",1373223160
6002953,comment,6001827,6002415,4,0,encoderer,,,"If you mean &quot;far different things&quot; relating to weight gain or loss, I completely, completely disagree.<p>In terms of weight gain or loss, a calorie is a calorie is a calorie. That&#x27;s why there are fad diets that have and do work for people that each cut different things. Low carbs in one. Low protein in another. The Cookie Diet for chrissakes. They work because the common thread between them is caloric restriction.<p>Now, if you consume nothing but 2000 calories of Ice Cream every day, you will surely develop some nutritional issues. And yes that totally will affect your overall health. But that&#x27;s something different than what the GP was discussing (though that may well have been your entire point which is fair.)<p>One interesting thing I picked up from a Pollan talk on NPR (but have not yet read the underlying research myself) is that there is some evidence that in one way all calories are not the same: The mechanics of digestion is affected by the texture and composition of the food. So 100 calories of crunch granola seems to be metabolized differently than 100 calories of soft chewy brownie. But the affect here is how many calories are extracted from the input.<p>My source for this is a lot of reading and my own personal experiences going from 6&#x27;2, 210 and flabby to 170 and toned, cutting down from 36&quot; waist to 32&quot;, from XL shirts to Medium in the process. I did this primarily over 14 months and did quite a bit of experimentation in there (Fruit cleanses, Juice cleanses, egg white protein supplements -- as i&#x27;m not a fan of protein powders), and for the 6 months since, as I&#x27;ve maintained weight and increased muscle tone.<p>The composition of my diet has changed but the pattern has held the same and I believe the pattern is what has had the most effect for me. Without realizing it, I devised a diet that other people call &quot;intermittent fasting.&quot; I consume, literally, 95% of my calories in 6 hours between 2PM and 8PM (when I have my lunch, dinner and dessert). I had no idea that this was a &quot;thing&quot; and not just something peculiar to myself. It works beautifully for me. I gym in the morning 3 days a week. I feel healthy and skinny and look good in tight clothing and finally, finally at age 30 feel good about myself physically.",1373223143

The system is pretty accurate and reliable and can deliver landings as good as a well-trained and experienced pilot can.<p>When I saw the rather steep final approach the aircraft was making, I had suspected that the pilots were doing a manual landing. Now that we have information that the ILS was temporarily inoperational this appears to be what transpired and the pilots manually flew the final approach.<p>The precise reasons for why the manual approach ended up in this accident are still to be determined. One thing that I will point out though is that pilots for modern jetliners do relatively little actual manual flying of the plane. Modern airplanes have advanced FMS (Flight Management System) that allow for automatic flying from lift-off until landing with pilots overseeing the system. Given this lack of manual flying, there is a greater potential for human error when a pilot is required to actually do manual flying.",1373221454

That difference was a bit euphoric.\n3) Being in ketosis isn&#x27;t like being pregnant.  There are varying degrees - hence the spectrum of colors on the ketostix.  That said, there is a slippery slope where indulging &quot;delicious things&quot; can quickly lead to carb cravings that wreck your low carb eating regimen.

Of course it makes sense that one can&#x27;t do the latter; when developing software in general, but an MVP in particular, one has to pick and choose which categories of users to target. One has to choose which features to implement and which to leave out or save for later. But it still seems wrong to suggest that one can ignore a set of potential users who might be a good fit for the application in every way, but happen to have a disability through no choice of their own. To get an idea of the consequences when accessibility is ignored, check out this blog post:<p><a href=""http://blindaccessjournal.com/2005/02/opportunity-lost-to-technology-inaccessibility/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blindaccessjournal.com/2005/02/opportunity-lost-to-te...</a><p>Maybe I&#x27;m just too close to this particular issue. after all, I&#x27;m visually impaired myself, and my boss and most of my coworkers are totally blind. Nonetheless, I believe that accessibility shouldn&#x27;t be a nice-to-have feature, but something one just expects to be there, like security. A commenter on another sub-thread pointed out the absurdity of suggesting that a developer can ignore security even for a prototype. I think the same holds for accessibility. Browsers, toolkits, and frameworks can do a lot to make it more likely that an application will be accessible by default, but I think that as with security, some level of consideration from the application developer will always be necessary.<p>Agreed about &quot;people with disabilities&quot; being too broad a market to focus on. Too many different disabilities. Where I work, we focus on making our software maximally usable for blind people.",1373220782

Someone else has already done the design work for you. You can lean back and say: &quot;The solution is obvious.&quot; Then you only need to implement it. In my experience, the implementation always seems trivial in comparison to the design process.<p>But you are right, people who copy stuff often make poor copies. I think the problem is that they probably don&#x27;t fully understand your design. They see how you solved something, but they don&#x27;t understand <i>why</i> you solved it that way.<p>Finally, I don&#x27;t think a rebuild is the same as a copy, because you generally only rebuild when something doesn&#x27;t work.

And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations\nbelong to God? tell me them, I pray you.<p>40:9 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him,\nIn my dream, behold, a vine was before me; 40:10 And in the vine were\nthree branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot\nforth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes: 40:11 And\nPharaoh&#x27;s cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them\ninto Pharaoh&#x27;s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh&#x27;s hand.<p>40:12 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The\nthree branches are three days: 40:13 Yet within three days shall\nPharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou\nshalt deliver Pharaoh&#x27;s cup into his hand, after the former manner\nwhen thou wast his butler.<p>40:14 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew\nkindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh,\nand bring me out of this house: 40:15 For indeed I was stolen away out\nof the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that\nthey should put me into the dungeon.<p>40:16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he\nsaid unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three\nwhite baskets on my head: 40:17 And in the uppermost basket there was\nof all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out\nof the basket upon my head.<p>40:18 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation\nthereof: The three baskets are three days: 40:19 Yet within three days\nshall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a\ntree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.<p>40:20 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh&#x27;s birthday,\nthat he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head\nof the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.<p>40:21 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and\nhe gave the cup into Pharaoh&#x27;s hand: 40:22 But he hanged the chief\nbaker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.<p>40:23 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.<p>41:1 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh\ndreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.<p>41:2 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured\nkine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.<p>41:3 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the\nriver, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon\nthe brink of the river.<p>41:4 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven\nwell favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.<p>41:5 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears\nof corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.<p>41:6 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind\nsprung up after them.<p>41:7 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.\nAnd Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.<p>41:8 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled;\nand he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the\nwise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none\nthat could interpret them unto Pharaoh.<p>41:9 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember\nmy faults this day: 41:10 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put\nme in ward in the captain of the guard&#x27;s house, both me and the chief\nbaker: 41:11 And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed\neach man according to the interpretation of his dream.",1373220402

It&#x27;s the America we get though due to our longstanding apathy and inability to curb special interest groups and corporate control of politics. I think things will change though. Things have been pretty nice in the US for a while. We&#x27;re now seeing the dark side of apathy and people are starting to care again (in my opinion). It had been pretty easy to shrug off politics as corrupt and not care when we still had relative normalcy. But a lot of Americans have awoken in recent weeks to find themselves living in a sci-fi dystopia that we were warned about in the classics of literature, the kind that had always been eerily similar to our lives but never quite reached. We&#x27;re now in full on 1984 and Americans won&#x27;t accept that, I guarantee it (we&#x27;re the country that ended slavery and celebrate our roots as rebels: we shall overcome).",1373220275

The reward for this loyalty?  Crowd: a whole new product, with a separate, spendy license.  Bizarrely, Confluence is capable of doing this LDAP integration without Crowd.  But rather than port that over to Jira and make some users happy, Atlassian decided to take another bite out of their wallets instead.<p>I actually bought Crowd, out of desperation to solve the problem, but dropped it after a year.  Trivially obvious features weren't implemented.

1738269,comment,1736779,1737362,0,0,sophacles,,,"Actually there is one big one I can think of: women's fashions vs mens fashions. The fashions and hairdos and whatnot for women just plain require a lot of work to look right. Combined with makeup, it is a big deal. To look decent, most women need to spend 30-60 minutes a day on that stuff. This really adds up, imagine an hour of your day on nothing but preening.<p>You could argue that ""they don't need to"" and I call bullshit. Go down to the nearest college and pay attention to the comments made about the female grad students who do eschew the preening hour vs the comments about those who don't. It is absurd.  A man who doesn't bother to do his hair right is ""eccentric"" or ""a bit of a slob"" but this trangression is quickly overlooked (a fact many geeks take great advantage of).  A woman doing the same will forever be looked down on as 'that frumpy chick' or 'she could really be something if she took care of herself'.

1738262,comment,1737867,1737867,0,0,biznickman,,,"The greatest issue, as you acknowledge in your post, was that you weren't testing the point closest to the sale.  The first thing to test is the final registration page.  I often spend a fair amount of money to drive traffic that I can optimize against to single page landing pages.  If you can't make enough money through Google Ads or Facebook ads (e.g. your cost per sale > revenue per sale), then you either have a bad business or a shitty landing page.<p>Rather than just optimizing existing traffic, buy traffic and find out how far off you are.  The best part of these ad systems is that they are relatively efficient. That means you should be able to quickly figure out how far you are off.<p>While I'm sure ""learn Japanese"" has already been taken, there are probably plenty of long-tail keywords as well as people on Facebook who haven't been targeted.  Your key is going to be to find out who those people are and drive them to your site.<p>I tend to be pretty straight forward with my own investments in projects: if there's a huge gap between cost of acquisition and revenue per customer (or present value of the LTV of the customer), you probably need to build something better or change your product all together.  Your own internal cost per user will end up being just as high as google ads (if not higher), except google provides an instant vehicle for testing.  In other words, it will help you fail quicker ... something that's extremely valuable in the world of startups.",1285731704

However, it seems that at least now, with Groupon in its galloping stride, there's no real doubt most promotions will hit their target participation level. That is, it's more a promotional mechanism for focusing consumer attention, rather than a solution for a coordinated-decisionmaking problem.<p>There's room for other innovations in these areas, as well. The 'dominant assurance contract' gives an extra sweetener back to pledgers if the threshold <i>isn't</i> met, to make assurance contracts work for otherwise nonexcludable 'public' goods where bystanders might normally hope to free-ride after others fund.

However, I don't expect that people would ever pay me to do it because there are so many people passionate about it that it gets done for free.<p>I believe I would feel the same way if my passion were English literature.  The barrier to entry is so low that if that's your thing, after some initial training you can accomplish whatever it is you want to do absent the assistance of a highly-paid professor.<p>I don't understand why you would eschew the monetary value of something in one breath and then complain with the next that nobody is willing to pay you to teach it.  If you're that passionate about it, screw the money and do it anyway.  Either that or what you have is a hobby, not a profession.<p>Or maybe I'm wrong and society is lacking that final breakthrough deconstruction of Proust before we all happily move forward toward enlightenment.

Sure on a large scale if the company stores the data on your phone the data that company stores is decentralized; however look at it from an individual perspective my smartphone is an extremely centralized ""life storage device.""  If someone gets your phone they get your contact list, your emails, text messages, calender, social network info, etc.  Why add credit cards to the list?<p>Additionally if you keep everything on your phone you need to spend more effort making sure your phone is secure.  If I keep my CC's on my phone I need to make sure my phone is as safe as my wallet, and anyone who sees my phone will know that they can take my phone and get my credit cards.<p>If the info is stored on the company's servers than they are responsible for keeping it secure.  Given the value of the data they have security would (hopefully) be an integral part of the system.  On top of that, if a breech does occur the company is responsible for anything that happens, and the odds of the criminal using my specific info is less than if someone took my phone.",1285729272

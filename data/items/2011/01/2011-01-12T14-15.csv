2096303,comment,2096088,2096220,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"From Gladwell's <i>Outliers</i>:<p><i>In the 1940s and 1950s the old-line law firms of New York operated like a private club. They were all headquartered in downtown Manhattan, in and around Wall Street, in somber, granite-faced buildings. The partners at the top firms graduated from the same Ivy League schools, attended the same churches, and summered in the same oceanside towns on Long Island. They wore conservative gray suits. Their partnerships were known as ""white-shoe"" firms – in apparent reference to the white bucks favored at the country club or a cocktail party, and they were very particular in who they hired. As Erwin Smigel wrote in </i>The Wall Street Lawyer<i>, his study of the New York legal establishment of that era, they were looking for:<p>""lawyers who are Nordic, have pleasing personalities and ‘clean-cut’ appearances, are graduates of the ‘right schools’, have the ‘right’ social background and experience in the affairs of the world, and are endowed with tremendous stamina. A former law school dean, in discussing the qualities students need to obtain a job, offers a somewhat more realistic picture. ‘To get a job [students] should be long enough on family connections, long enough on ability or long enough on personality, or a combination of these. Something called acceptability is made up of the sum of its parts. If a man has any of these things, he could get a job. If he has two of them, he can have a choice of jobs; if he has three, he could go anywhere.’""</i><p>Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose. At least nowadays you don't necessarily have to be white, male, or non-Jewish, and the definition of <i>Ivy League</i> has broadened a bit, but this clubbishness is how it's been for a century and more. What, you thought people battled each other to get into Harvard because Harvard's graduate TAs were such talented and dedicated teachers relative to the competition?",1294844213

2096301,comment,2093315,2093611,0,0,jasongullickson,,,"I think the key thing to note is that, even if you don't personally <i>like</i> some of Pixar's films you cannot deny the quality of filmmaking, which increases with each film in every quantifiable way.<p>There is a lot about film (as with any art) that is subjective but there are specific and measurable qualities of a film that can be measured and in each of these Pixar struggles (I say struggle because they set themselves a very high bar) to exceed the qualities of their previous work.  In this way they are very different from the Disney of the 1980's/1990's where quality was liquidated as a way to increase the revenue of films who's value lies solely in brand and character recognition.<p>I agree that the level of merchandising associated with these films is absurd, but I don't know how much the filmmakers have to do with this and we could point to plenty of examples in the software sector who have a hard time saying no when a few million dollars are waved in front of their faces.<p>If you want to learn more about how Pixar will bleed for quality, research the story behind Toy Story 2; if you can find me another company willing to risk everything for the sake of preventing even one low-grade product from reaching the market, I'll be impressed.",1294844205

They fail to see that to <i>make it</i> you need not only look after your own best interest but of those people around you also. That top is not a singular point, but it is an area of larger structure - a pyramid if you will. And to get to the top of a pyramid you need a strong fundament and if you want to stay at the top you absolutely must hone and take care of your wider base.<p>Nowadays it's way easier to check the validity of your strategy. It is easier to check historical references for similar contexts as ones own. And these smart people just decide that they will replay the history. And this is the ultimate risk in my opinion - repeating same thing over and over (definition of insanity by Einstein I believe?) and expecting different results.

I once took the deposition of a guy who was suing my client, his former employer, claiming that he owned an invention he'd made for them. The guy kept a diary. Instead of giving me only the diary entries that had to do with the invention, his lawyer just turned over the entire diary for the relevant period -- including entries about feeding live mice to his pet snake. Needless to say, in the deposition I asked the guy about that. Snake-feeding was completely irrelevant to the case, but if we'd gone to trial, I imagine I would have tried to find some way to put that testimony and those diary entries in front of the jury.

Both the Democratic and Republican party are to the right of most, if not all, Scandinavian political parties.<p>In a system with more than two parties, you have to name your party something that actually connotates the party's policies (Democrats and Republicans doesn't exactly mean anything to outsiders), and considering that many of these parties have existed for over 100 years, their policies have obviously changed since they got their names. (This makes it pretty awkward for the parties who deviate from their historic names. Consider the parties that were created when Communism was all the rave, but are still around. They need to distance themselves from the past without denouncing their party's raison d'etre. I'm sure that's why we have so many nebulous party names cropping up: ""Freedom"", ""People's"" parties and whatnot.)<p>You often hear people refer to American policians as liberal, progressive, conservative, libertarian and so forth, which are ideologies more so than something reflected by the party names. Democrats can also be conservative (Blue Dogs), and so on and so forth.<p>In a system that isn't (basically) a two-party system, people use their party name to characterize their policy: ""Social-democratic, moderate, conservative, socialist, liberal, (which means something akin to libertarian on that side of the Atlantic)"" as using other attribute would be a denouncement. Instead, silly buzz words like ""welfare"", ""freedom"", ""fair"", ""tough"", ""rewarding"", ""equality"", ""Danish"", ""Swedish"", ""Norwegian"", etc. crop up to frame their policies. This makes it an enormous clusterfuck to get a grasp of the - actual - politics in a political environment where basically all the parties are social-liberal.<p>You have to find <i>some</i> word to delineate the coalitions from each other, and there isn't any great way to do this.

You could improve your revenue-per-employee figure by finding $100m of employees, firing them, and then hiring an external firm for $200m to do the same job. All that's really done though is just hidden the employees: they're now employees of another firm, but they're still indirectly costing you $200m. To account for that, you need a measure other than revenue-per-employee, like perhaps revenue-per-dollar-spent.<p>It really tells you more about corporate structure than anything else. Companies that do a lot of in-house work will do badly on the measure, while companies that prefer to mostly pay others to handle large portions of their work will do well--- regardless of which company manages to get the work done cheaper.",1294841838

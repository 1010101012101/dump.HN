He noticed that about half the orders were for large pepperoni pizzas. So he had his drivers always carry an additional large pepperoni pizza in the car, and he&#x27;d call them mid-route if an additional order came in. It usually did, so thankfully very few cold pizzas died, and he sold more pizzas per hour than before. Saved on gas, drivers made more tips, and eventually he ended up getting heaters and drivers carrying as many as 10 per trip. Combine that with the deeper large pepperoni price cut he could now afford, it was quickly became the busiest joint in town. Too bad he never expanded.&quot;<p>Makes me imagine a person/duo in a van, back filled with a limited range of curries on the go and rice cookers, driving around a particular area getting delivery requests and payment on their phone.

This is difficult for any non-technical user to do without instructions.<p>The System on a Stick is fully preconfigured.  Insert Stick, turn on computer and away you go.  It is every bit as easy as a new piece of hardware with its OS and configurations flashed on ROM.<p>I do not see a small, low power, fanless device as being incompatible with a System on a Stick.  Plug computers or credit card sized computers should have slots for USB sticks, SD cards or CF cards.  And they should be able to boot from them (no on-disk bootloader needed).<p>Not every consumer may be ready to make a purchase of new hardware.  Evidence of this is the fact there are a suprising large number of people still using what we would consider &quot;old&quot; hardware.  Desktop PC&#x27;s in fact.   Regardless of a consumer&#x27;s appetite and budget for new gadgets, certainly they can afford a USB stick, SD card or a CF card.  They probably own one already.  They might even have a CF card left over from the days when digital cameras used CF cards.  The System on a Stick will fit on a 16MB card.<p>I would imagine most people indeed currently have some i386 hardware, either a PC or a laptop.  Thus they have what they need to try out the System _right now_, without making a new hardware purchase.  When they eventually make their next hardware purchase (maybe an ARM tablet), they will then have spare i386 hardware.<p>As the System can run without touching the disk, there is no install anything.  It can be used on i386 with OSX or Windows installed without affecting those systems.  A user can perform tests of end-to-end connectivity and communications using any smartphone with a web browser.<p>I like the sound the AdTrap Kickstarter project.  An additonal computer (&quot;router&quot;) that sits between the user and her modem is I believe the right way forward for solving problems of privacy (e.g. blocking ads) and security (e.g. secure communications), not to mention other increased functionality.  I simply wanted to point out that purchasing new hardware is not necessary to get started.<p>Whatever shape or form that router takes, I think it must be bootable from external media with the bootloader of the user&#x27;s choosing.  Any less means we are purchasing yet another closed system and putting someone else in control.  By all means make this router function without any user input (turn it on and you&#x27;re done).  But by no means should the ability of the (more conscious) user to fully control the router be limited.  That means open source OS and open source bootloader.",1377052680

The people that tend to &quot;hoot and holla&quot; in <repsonse> to violence are by far and large predominantly black and latinos. Or canadians after a hockey match.

Drugs come into this country because of demand (primarily), not because of supply. The supply happens because the demand is so high, the economics are so compelling. The markup and profit margins on something like cocaine are enourmous.  Just last week you had a couple of brits arrested in peru. carying $1-2m of drugs. Going to Ibiza. Do you really think the peruvians are the ones with the Drug problem? Of course not. It&#x27;s rather the (relatively) rich europeans that want to get off their faces in the Clubs.  Where, btw, paying for drugs is cheaper than booze. But absent gold or diamond mining, there is just nothing else with this kind of profit margin and $$/mass ratio available to people that live in the rual hilsides (where cocoa is farmed) in S.

To free yourself from the powers of the few, you first have to step away from the social control of the many. This social control comes from peers ratting each other out. It&#x27;s conditioning designed into modern, industrial education. Since the many are busy watching each other, the few can step back, secure in knowing that the web of social fear and shame will keep people in line. (This web of fear and shame is what we&#x27;re building our &quot;social networks&quot; out of).<p>So the first step is free yourself from your own fears and shame.<p>You free yourself from fear by accepting the possibility of what you fear. Then you tune into the experience of fear itself, and let it go. People stay afraid because they don&#x27;t want to tune into the specific emotion of fear. Where are you experiencing fear in your body? Is it tension in your chest? Is something sharp in your gut? Is it a tremor on your back? If it feels uncomfortable, then you&#x27;re on the right track. Truth is hidden within the things we don&#x27;t want to see.<p>You free yourself from shame by letting go of pride. When you have no pride, you have no shame. When you have no shame, then you can act impeccably. This is also called acting with integrity.<p>It&#x27;s only when you let go of fear and shame that compassion can open up. Most people&#x27;s notion of compassion are really driven by fear, shame, and guilt. That&#x27;s not compassion, merely co-dependency. I appease your fear, and you don&#x27;t mention my shame, and we&#x27;ll get along just fine. We&#x27;ll even call it being &quot;nice.&quot;<p>If you want to change the world, first change yourself. Instead of fighting for power, own the power over yourself.<p>Do you own your fears, or do your fears own you?",1377051543

As far as I can tell, the only thing Node.js brings to the table is an event loop. Event loops are not a particularly earth-shattering concept: Anyone who has written a graphical Win32 application by directly using the WinAPI has written an event loop (message loop in Win32 parlance). I do appreciate not having to write the loop myself, but:<p>1. An event loop can only handle concurrent I/O. Furthermore, because the event loop is hardcoded into every single Node.js instance, there are two legitimate choices that are nevertheless unavailable to a Node.js programmer: a) disabling the loop, if he does not need it, b) spawning multiple event loops as separate threads within a single Node.js instance.<p>2. Node.js offers no support whatsoever for concurrent <i>computation</i>. I know, I know, all your Web application does is move data between a database and a client. But, if the only use case of Node.js is going to be making Web applications, would it not have been better to make a Web application framework, and provide it as a library?<p>Languages that actually provide concurrency support (Erlang, Haskell and Rust, to name a few) make writing event loops as easy as it used to be in the 1990s.

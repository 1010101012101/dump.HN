198568,comment,197326,197326,0,0,cch,,,"I use TriNet at my company, and the cost is about made up for by the savings in the health care plans alone.  Factor in the benefits of someone else handling the work, and it is a no brainer for us.  Note that the avg wage of TriNet companies is over $100k, whereas Administaff is around $60k.  I think Administaff has a much broader base of client companies, but TriNet is higher end.  TriNet's only weakness is not having an integrated 401k, but it is not too hard to link Fidelity to it.",1211597777

198566,comment,198560,198560,0,0,markbao,,,"Google Docs, for sure. Zoho just <i>feels</i> strange to use, and their UI is just atrocious, to be honest. Google Docs gets the document organization on the dot (Zoho... botches it) and gets usability and lightness of the user interface correctly. Lastly, the collaboration features are better than Zoho Writer's.<p>I still kind of prefer some aspects of the Writely UI (<a href=""http://jaman.ca/files/images/writley-snap.JPG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jaman.ca/files/images/writley-snap.JPG</a>), but the new changes to the Google Docs UI make it awesome (especially the fixed-page-width view.)",1211597536

Sometimes I like typing how I feel about links into boxes. I can't figure out why people would use Facebook. I mean, I guess you can post links and type comments into boxes. All those photos and friends make it really confusing! I also don't see any tiny triangles to click on when I am on Facebook.",1211595341

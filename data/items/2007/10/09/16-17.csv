I have an open dev account and an empty application.<p>I got an official Facebook warning about one year ago for creating a group ""For every 100 people that join this group Apple will donate a laptop to a needy child."" I think it got to 250 people in an hour and then it was gone.<p>I had a middle name listed on Facebook as ""rupertmurdochsucks"" which was kind of a running joke. The only thing I can think of is that I recently contacted support about a bug that switched my class year to ""Alum."" They told me how to fix it and I did. But then maybe the CS person reported me for having a fake name, which seems really stupid, especially because they won't tell me what is going on.<p>\nI emailed disabled@facebook.com as instructed and just got an autoreply.<p>Can anyone help me out?",1191948496

I'd like to see Cringley do another one for a commentary in the last 10 years.  <p>It's funny how things have changed.  Towards the end when they were talking about the uncertain future, as a viewer I felt like someone from the future that traveled back in time.  They talked about, what's the next company to dominate?  I wanted to say ""Google!"" at the screen.  <p>One thing that I was kind of surprised about was that both microsoft and apple were both seen as ""the little guy"" against the big IBM.  Only apple, however, seemed to mature its image to the ""hip revolutionary"" whereas Microsoft grew to be viewed as ""borgish""<p>I see the same type of attitude change for Google in the last year.  Often called ""industry darling"" last year, Google started getting bits and pieces of flack.  You can't please everyone, naturally, but the whimper has intensified, especially after PG's ""MS is dead"" article, which put Google in everyone's sights.  It's easier to collectively hate the big guy.  <p>On a separate note,  it would seem from microsoft's actions of winning the browser wars and letting IE languish, etc. that they really just didn't get and missed out on the boat with search and the internet.  Surprisingly, Bill was on guard the whole time.  He was paranoid about the Next Big Thing, and surrounded himself with a ton of smart people and always looking to dip into different markets.  And still, with that kind of vigilance, search engines slipped through.  <p>So in a way, that's a bit reassuring (for us at hacker news), that in our fast paced technological push, there's always room to create new markets within a single lifetime.  And PG's probably right that big companies have more to fear from us the unknowns rather than other big companies--and it's not just because he's enamored with startups.",1191948476

65306,comment,64958,65004,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""When I lived there, it was very very hard to find technical people that were not ""corporate drones"". I knew maybe of only one or two startup (I am not sure they ended up anywhere).""<p>The startups are there, you just have to know where to look (i.e. have friends that also work for startups).  They <i>are</i> very ""enterprisey""; Boston doesn't do consumer startups the way the West Coast does.  <p>The culture is also very different here: on the East Coast, there's this notion of paying your dues before you're ready to start your own thing.  You're expected to <i>suffer</i> (probably a legacy of Boston's Puritan heritage) before you're ready to strike it big.  A typical Bostonian startup's path involves working for 10-30 years at one of the area businesses in your field, then gathering up some professional colleagues and striking out on your own, often building some tool that your former employer wants to buy.<p>My former boss was dead-set against me striking out on my own - he doesn't believe I've ""paid my dues"" and have enough industry experience to make it.  The idea of striking out into an unproven market, discovering it as you go along, and building your product on the way is complete anathema to the Boston startup scene.  Here, you're often expected to have a customer in hand (usually your former employer) when you approach venture capitalists, along with a team averaging 20-30 years industry experience or serious research background.<p>Almost all the startup founders I know here fit that pattern.  Avici's founders had all worked for BBN for about 30 years.  Avid's technical founder had worked for DEC for several years.  I think much of Stratus's initial team came from DEC.  Cybersmith's team came from Stratus and DEC.  One former employer spun off of Cybersmith.  Another's founder had been a trader on Wall Street (this was a financial software).  One of the other places I interviewed was a spinoff of Eze Castle, where the product had originally been developed.<p>I'd recommend Boston for any older founders in the audience.  Move to Boston, spend 5-10 years working at area companies while you build up professional contacts, and then strike out on your own.  Boston doesn't have the prejudice against older entrepreneurs that you'll find in SV, because for most of the industries here, age is an asset and not a liability.  Plus, it's a good place to raise a kid: the Boston suburbs (particularly to the west and northwest) are very safe, have good schools, strong senses of community, and lots of leafy wooded areas.<p>Nearly all the young startup-type folk I know - the ones without families, at least - are moving out to California though.  Their youth is an asset and not a liability there, and they get to work on generally cooler problems.",1191947316

It's like the pressure of not wanting to let your co-founder down affects you from the inside out, because you are constantly reminded of your shared fate. They're always there to keep you on your toes, but they don't become a force for extrinsic motivation (which can easily cause stress and deflation instead of adding energy to your inner drive).",1191945739

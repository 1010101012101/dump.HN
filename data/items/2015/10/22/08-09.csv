But, as a Haskell programmer, the Rust type system feels very foreign.<p>No typeclasses (and associated goodness), GADTs, HKTs, Monadic IO, first class functions, generic deriving, higher rank types, existential type, etc. These are bread-and-butter features in day-to-day Haskell work. Rust&#x27;s type system isn&#x27;t powerful enough to build the vast majority of the tools that Haskell programmers use every day.<p>I don&#x27;t mean this as a criticism; The Rust design seems solid. But different priorities lead to different trade-offs, and the end result is a very different type system.",1445504379

Gone are the days of Henry/Viera/Van Percy coming in as mediocre players only to be indispensable a season later.<p>I think if you look at some of the more recent meteoric rises, they all seems to come from lesser leagues or clubs, BVB/Juventus/Atlético Madrid/Porto, and to some extent Liverpool/Spurs (Bale/Suarez/Sterling/Coutinho/Kane).<p>I think signing a player with potential is only part of the issue, the key is playing, developing and nurturing them. With teams like BVB/Juventus/Atlético Madrid/Porto they are either in easier leagues where a player doesn&#x27;t have to be the finished article to excel, or financially constrained to not be able to purchase the finished article. With Spurs and Liverpool they fall into the later category so are forced to give youth players a chance.<p>Take Kevin De Bruyne as an example, an obvious talent purchased by Chelsea, but not played because he wasn&#x27;t quite finished (perhaps only in reputation rather than ability). Sold to play in a lesser league where he excelled, and then purchased for 50 million where his stature and starting place are then almost granted.<p>These days I think Arsene is stuck in a position where he has the money to spend, but ideally want&#x27;s to return to his roots of nurturing young players. However the fans and board aren&#x27;t willing to gamble on youth, in favor of signing 40/50 million finished articles.<p>A few million on an analytic company isn&#x27;t going to break the bank, and may be more valuable in opposition analysis than finding the next rough diamond.",1445504231

Nothing says that you can&#x27;t work with non-constructive logic in a programming language, or analyze non-constructive logics <i>as</i> programming languages. In fact that can be extremely useful although it&#x27;s also, at present, difficult and not super common.<p>The things you listed are extremely close to one of the foundational fields of CS, namely programming language theory. It&#x27;s funny that you should bring up the law of the excluded middle because I learned <i>a lot</i> about it by studying PL theory: did you know that adding callCC to your typed lambda calculus turns it from a constructive logic system to a classical one? And that double negation translation is just a CPS transform which, at least for me, is a heck of a lot easier to reason about than proof theory directly?<p>Everything in math is, at least in theory, provable. Provable in a discrete system (ie a formal logic) even if it&#x27;s reasoning <i>about</i> something that isn&#x27;t discrete. So there&#x27;s nothing fundamental stopping us from doing exactly the same proofs in a formal system that a <i>computer</i> can understand. Oh, say, a programming language.<p>Of course, with current technology, it&#x27;s difficult from a practical standpoint, but there&#x27;s nothing fundamental stopping us. And ideally it&#x27;s something we <i>should</i> do to ward off errors and also to create proof artifacts that can be analyzed and manipulated systematically.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t static analysis for mathematical proofs be great? Or papers written as libraries so that relying on a lemma literally links against the proof it was first defined in.<p>Seriously, if you dive into PL theory you&#x27;ll see that the line separating CS from math doesn&#x27;t really exist except as a social and technological phenomenon.

With a population of over 70 million, XX percent of the world&#x27;s proven oil reserves, a geostrategic location of tremendous (enviable?) significance, and a demonstrated potential to develop a nuclear-weapons program, the United States has no choice but to find a way to coexist - and to come to terms with - whatever government holds power in Tehran. [...]<p>> An unfortunate hallmark of US-Iranian relations since 2001 has been [the] growing divide between Washington and Tehran, chronicled by bombastic rhetorical broadsides that have been hurled publicly by each side against the other. The tragedy of the al-Qa&#x27;ida launched terrorist attacks against the US homeland in September 2001 prompted the US administration to engage in a far-reaching campaign to eradicate the sources of terrorism, and Iran, understandably - but regrettably - was swept up in the emotionally charged rhetoric that emanated from Washington under the seemingly all-encompassing rubric of &quot;The Global War On Terrorism&quot;. The gratuitious labeling of Iran as part of a worldwide &quot;axis of evil&quot; by President Bush combined with strong US criticisms of Iran&#x27;s nascent nuclear program and its meddling in Iraq led Tehran to view that Washington had embarked on a course of confrontation in the region that would soon set a kinetic focus on Iran. Even Iran&#x27;s positive engagement in helping repair the post-Taliban political environment in Afghanistan was met with indifference by Washington.

The issue has never been that we can&#x27;t write something that&#x27;s correct.<p>Getting that correctness to propagate because of the strictness of all the tools involved and accuracy of their construction is the issue, which leaves us with needing to either automate proofs with Coq or prove things in more general ways that lead to undecidable problems etc.  Still, the fact that one function can be written bug-free and known to be bug-free does indicate that it&#x27;s not an inevitability of probability playing out as code grows.<p>We have null-pointer exceptions and no maybe type.  The API&#x27;s that emit nulls sometimes make me expect sewage to leak from light sockets.  It&#x27;s possible to do better.  We just don&#x27;t, and none of us love it.  Rust and Kotlin are at least very exciting.  I&#x27;d like to understand some Coq more in the context of x86.  What routines are strictly necessary to even do Coq?

This outside observer would simply observe that the particle has spin &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot; but would never know that it was entangled earlier by someone else. This observer would never know it was in a superposition unless they had knowledge that someone had previously done this. Only the person who entangled the particle can clue the observer in on the fact that they were entangled.<p>I can give you a particle, tell you it&#x27;s in a superposition but you&#x27;d have no way to verify this. If you observe the particle, perhaps you&#x27;d see it&#x27;s in spin &quot;up&quot; but that would be meaningless because that observation wouldn&#x27;t tell you anything about whether it was entangled or not. You only know about its current state. There is nothing in your observation that shows &quot;hey the particle just changed from superposition to spin up&quot;<p>Thanks for the replies!

The price can be tens of millions of euro. The buying club will tie down the new player to a long contract as part of the purchase, perhaps 4 or 5 years.<p>Wages are low for young players, but will be increased rapidly if the player emerges as a real talent that other clubs would want, which gives the club the chance to extend the contract through renegotiation. A longer contract for a highly rated young player would mean higher wages also as part of the bargain, although contracts can be renegotiated and extended with higher wages at any time, if the club views the player as an asset that they wish to keep.<p>When they extend that contract it generally means that another club who tries to buy will have to pay more, and usually wages are at least matched and often increased by the buying club.<p>Sorry that&#x27;s not a succinct answer.",1445502652

A classic Arsene Wenger signing was Freddie Ljungberg (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredrik_Ljungberg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredrik_Ljungberg</a>). He was signed from a team called Halmstads in the Swedish league. While Halmstads were doing pretty well in the Swedish league at this time, they were unknowns on the world scene. Since Arsenal had little competition in signing him and since Ljungberg was pretty unknown they were able to pay £3m - which is not a large sum at that level level. For some context, at the time the most expensive signing in the world was Denilson who Real Betis bought for £20m. However Ljungberg went on to play 216 games for Arsenal, scoring 72 goals which is a considerable number. For comparison Denilson - who was played in roughly the same position - played 186 games for Betis and scored 13 goals. Ljungberg is generally considered to be an Arsenal legend, while Denilson is thought of as an embarrassing waste of money and gets barely a footnote on the Real Betis wikipedia page.<p>As for what is considered a &quot;legend&quot; I really don&#x27;t know, football is weird like that.

A very good player might make £10m/yr in wages, and cost £50m to buy from a different team.<p>Unknown players will be cheaper on both, but even if you picked them up on a one year contract and they immediately proved that their next contract should be highly paid, you&#x27;ve still saved a potentially huge amount on buying them before they were worth a huge signing fee.<p>Gradually salary will catch up based on how well they play and based on the market, and the team that found this cheap player can either stop considering him a cheap player (but still be glad he came in cheaply), or can sell him on for a profit.<p>The top 10 salaries in the premier league range from ~£10m/year to ~£15m/year, so consider that buying a top player and keeping them for 2 years can often cost £20m-£80m. If you can buy a player for cheap and pay him not a huge amount, you can afford to spend a few years turning him into a star player and still come out way ahead even if in those few years he wasn&#x27;t giving you value other than turning into a better player.<p>How long does it take for a player to become legendary? &quot;Legendary&quot; would normally be reserved either for the very best of the best, or on a team level based on both quality but also loyalty - as such you&#x27;d rarely see someone be called a legend before spending quite a few years at a club. But a player can go from relatively unknown to &quot;shit he&#x27;s really good&quot; in as little as a season potentially - maybe he was playing in a league that doesn&#x27;t get as much attention from countries with the bigger leagues, maybe he needed better team-mates around him to bring out his best, maybe a manager or coach helped him change his playing style very quickly, etc.",1445502154

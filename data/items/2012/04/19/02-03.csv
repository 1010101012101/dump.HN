3861182,comment,3860361,3860871,4,0,ramanujan,,,"Two ideas on your post regarding potential technical resolutions.<p>First, in a web environment, one is probably logging all API calls and their effects on the server side. With Windows, you couldn't do that as your users were hitting local code rather than an MS server. This makes deprecation of older APIs much easier, in part because you can see which of your functions a particular API user is calling and in which order. Done right, these backend metrics will make it easy to identify the most popular use cases as well as functions that aren't used much.<p>Additionally, there was an interesting HN post from a few days back on self-describing APIs[1]. If this catches on, it will also make it easier to deprecate old APIs, especially if the OPTIONS request returns JSON. With a little bit of reflection up front, client code can then determine the most up to date way to achieve the effect they are trying to get with this API call. This may slow down client code (requiring one or more redirects up front) but won't crash it. Apple's support of Rosetta for PPC shows that slow emulation is a good intermediate between outright breakage (a la Facebook) and infinite grandfathering (a la early MS).<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3841710"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3841710</a>",1334803729

Oracle did a 180 on supporting Apache then stabbing them in the back.<p>When Sun owned Java, Oracle are documented as supporting Apache's requests to get the FOU restrictions lifted and helped Apache slow the development of Java at the JCP level.  When Oracle bought out Sun, they immediately stopped supporting Apache for both FOU and rammed through Java 7 without really getting many of JCP on board.  IBM basically folded (after spending so much effort on Harmony - I suspect that IBM are kicking themselves for not buying Sun when they had the chance, I and many other people involved in Java at the time thought it was certain IBM were going to buy Sun out) and most of the other JCP members abstained or quit.  Even members who voted for Java 7 added comments to the effect that they were not happy.<p>This is all in the public record : <a href=""https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the_asf_resigns_from_the"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the_asf_resigns_fr...</a>",1334803717

3861176,comment,3859685,3859685,1,0,flocial,,,"I think passion is something you do regardless of financial rewards.  How many pop artists succeeded with the sole intent of making money?  Even those superficial rappers touting material gains probably enjoy the craft (at least the ones with staying power).  I think the intersection of passion and success (defined materially) is when you consistently get better at your passion to the point where you can offer value above and beyond others who share your passion.<p>A case in point is exercise.  I see lots of people in the gym who are committed and even fanatic about achieving their fitness goals.  However, the lot of them wouldn't be able to cover living costs if they tried to do it as a job.  Still, it doesn't stop them from coming to the gym and spending a significant part of their income on their passion.<p>Just because you don't make money directly from your passion doesn't mean much to me either because it can drive success in other parts of your life.<p>I also think people confuse passion with strong appreciation.  For example, you can love rock music and claim to be passionate about it.  However, you might not be passionate enough to push yourself to practice the craft of music only to listen and critique it.<p>The confusing thing about this article is that he does manage to transition his career into something vaguely related and not something completely different.  Maybe it's the teaching aspect that's really important to him but it still seems like a reasonable career path in line with his core passion.",1334803635
3861175,comment,3859685,3859685,10,0,dkrich,,,"I don't really get what his passion was. He states that he followed his passion and became a teacher, but having never worked as a teacher, there must have been some aspects of teaching that he thought would be fulfilling. Most of the time when people choose career paths it is for reasons that have nothing to do with passion. In fact, for most people it seems that career choice is just a mixture of luck and somewhat random choices. What exactly makes somebody start down the path of being a lawyer? Maybe their father was a lawyer or they saw a movie about a lawyer that influenced them. Conversely, somebody might become a librarian because a job opens in their hometown and they just drift into it without much planning due to sheer convenience (I know a lot of people like that). I think that career progression is largely luck-based as well, because you cannot possibly know what the reality of day-to-day life in a career looks like without living it.<p>Having gone through an MBA program, I have seen this first hand. People's entire career paths are condensed down to 18 months and a set of a few companies that just happen to recruit where you go to school. One student may come in convinced that he wants to be an entrepreneur, get pulled into the consulting crowd and have a complete shift in goals, just to get dinged by the top consulting firms and end up settling into the management track at Sears. That's the trouble with following your passion- it is pretty tough to define just what that is, and the fact that there are some jobs that involve it to an extent is probably not the best way to follow it.<p>As an aside: one other thing I noticed which was quite prevalent in the bschool crowd was this dream to do your own thing and run your own business. I would hear people say ""my goal is to start a company"" or ""I want to join a startup."" The odd thing is that none of these people actually took direct steps toward trying to start a business. They felt pressure from their peers getting lucrative offers from consulting firms and such and said things like ""I'm going to work for a few years and get some experience under my belt and then I'm going to start a business or join a startup."" It seems what made these people happy was convincing themselves that they were planning a future that would best set them up to create this business and become rich at some point in the future. What made them get out of bed early and work hard was satisfying some false prerequisite that they dangled in front of their own face. When that was accomplished, they created another, and another, and another. It seems that actually is where their happiness came from- making themselves believe that they were progressing towards their goal.",1334803624

Of course the latter organization will be cheaper, because the entire organization has a different set of priorities. In particular, NASA's mandate requires it to spend money on trying to make its results constitute scientific advances, i.e. publishable work, releasable data, etc.; whereas Space-X is happy to save money by not doing so.<p>For example, I've been looking for the FTP site where I can download raw data originating from Space-X and released into the public domain, and I can't find one.

Because they have to sell their products/services to others, they need to please their clients/customers on an everyday basis. They have to have a rather good profile in order to keep their business going (and their own organization, for the matter).<p>You'd rather have to wonder about politicians, who get rich by diverting voters' resources, misusing the state money, and lying about their own responsibilities.

It's the people who have <i>made</i> great wealth that appear to be doing things like this. IIRC James Cameron drove tractor-trailers for a living before he broke into being a director. As we all know, Google started in a garage. Steve Jobs backpacked around India, etc.<p>What we seem to be seeing is that these ""new money"" entrepreneurs spend a great portion of their wealth, using their skills at innovation and bulldogging people into doing what they need, to make great changes. It's worthy of note that Rockefeller, who was the worlds first billionaire, donated $550 million through his philanthropy by 1918. He essentially made the University of Chicago. From about 1900 to 1940 his personal wealth was steady at approximately 1% of the US GDP. More notable still, is that from his first pay check he gave 10% of his earnings to his church. His funding of medical research was instrumental in the eradication of hookworm and yellow fever.<p>Bill Gates is rather fittingly working in Rockefeller's shoes.<p>I think its fantastic that these ""new money"" billionaires are literally chasing their dreams and dragging us along with them.<p>I'm 24, and at 16 I was thinking that my chance of seeing another planet or even space was solely reliant on finding some LSD.

Here's how I would address that.<p>1) They may not necessarily think they're going to be able to deploy a cost effective business service overnight. They may realize it's going to take a while, and more pieces have to be put in place. But there are things they can start working on now that push in that direction.<p>2) SpaceX. And to a lesser extent, the other space teams and competitions that have had successes in last few years. Surely one of them, or a combination of a few of them, are going to bring that cost/risk to orbit down significantly. Opening up new business possibilities as potentially profitable.<p>3) All the recent apparent advances in robotics capabilities, embedded computing and submersibles (where the mission demands are so extreme they are not too unlike spacecraft in many ways). Drones. Pack mules. Exo-wear. Quadcopters. Powerful computers that also happen to be small, lower power draining and super cheap -- cost of risk goes down, variety of potential applications goes up.<p>4) Increasing sense of impending resource wars on Earth, due to the rise of the BRIC countries, all the key minerals needed by modern electronics/computing/batteries/PV only present in China or Africa or country-that-is-not-the-US. The predicted water shortages. The increasing sense that the way that modern large-scale agriculture is done (high yields via chemicals that are toxic to humans in the long run) and so might need to switch back to lower-yield-per-acre methods. And so on. The strategic takeaway is that if population grows, Earth resources grow more scarce, and especially US-controlled resources grow more scarce, then there may be an increased demand for resources from somewhere off-Earth, or kept entirely out of control of some particular Earth-based nations or companies. Is this an immediate need requiring an overnight solution? No. But if you have billions, you can afford to think about the longer term, and you have the money to risk starting those investments today. Just in case. Also, to kick it up a notch, consider the alternative: do you really think that, say, the US Congress or Presidency is going to take any bold decisive action that's going to positively address these long term concerns? Do you think they're even allowed to, by the rules they have to follow, or by their political patrons? Or do you think they'll stick to addressing more ephemeral, near-term concerns, to quick wins, political point scoring, propaganda, etc.? I know how I'd bet. :)",1334801023

The new construction I see in the Washington DC area has none of these things, whether it&#x27;s a new apartment in the city or a new house in the suburbs.  The ceilings are quite high--typically ten feet.  Even basement ceilings are quite high, in contrast to old homes where one often must bend over a bit while in the basement.  Door frames are high.<p>Windows if anything are too big, not too small!  My city apartment has floor to ceiling windows which are difficult for window treatments.  Suburban homes can have huge two-story family rooms.<p>Noise is more a problem from adjoining units.  Outside noise is sealed out quite well thanks to double-pane windows.<p>Overall new construction is of quite high quality when it comes to what&#x27;s important.  New homes have smoke detectors, fire sprinklers, better electrical systems, more durable cladding on the outside, better insulation, more bathrooms, and air conditioning.  As someone who has seen both old and new homes and has considered living in both, I do not get the nostalgia for old homes.  Most home buyers around here agree as they are gutting old homes and renovating them, not living in them as is.  I considered living in old homes, but only because they are in good locations.

They are, however, not interesting or really acknowledging the role that robotics/computer vision/etc will play in the future. It&#x27;s not really his fault though. Rather, I think many people are just ignorant of the profound impact that this kind of technology is going to have, simply because their direct exposure to it is so minimal.<p>As someone that has had experience in the rev. Left for some years and saw developments with robotics in research at a well-regarded school as a grad student, I feel like I have some perspective on this article. What I saw in school really made me change my mind and re-evaluate how the future will play out. Things are going to change and the genie, so to speak is out of the bottle and there&#x27;s no putting it back in. But as pretty much all most socio-enviro-economic problems, the impediments we collectively face generally aren&#x27;t technological as much as they are political, and that&#x27;s where the activist focus needs to be. But I digress.<p>Mr. Phillips, doesn&#x27;t seem to get that the technology isn&#x27;t ready to displace humans from all work. The real threat (which is a threat until further notice) is that robotic technology is now &quot;good enough&quot; to do the kind of work that was just out of reach of automation in the past. It is not inconceivable to think robots will be able to perform the tasks of human garment workers soon. The gap between robots and semi-skilled labor are disappearing every year.<p>The idea for calling for a stronger labor movement as a solution is frankly laughable. It isn&#x27;t going to happen any time soon and the economic conditions (what Marxists would colloquially refer to as &quot;super-profitability&quot;) that created things like a labor aristocracy (another term) and social democracy no longer exist. How does one recreate a strong labor movement when the industries that were unionized are structurally hollowed out by no-pay robotic &quot;labor&quot; (which isn&#x27;t labor in the Marxist sense either)? I&#x27;d love to hear a non hand wavy answer (seriously!).<p>UBI is actually a strong step on the road to the Marxist idea of communism (ironically enough) in that it does something special: it decouples the idea of compensation from labor, which is one of the long term goals of a society transforming from capitalism to a stateless, classless society. Lenin had a term for this too, which was &quot;bourgeois right&quot;.<p>Anyway, my 2 cents.",1446861347

I wasn&#x27;t giving much thought to your arguments because they seemed to be fundamentally missing the point, and you were probably thinking the same thing.<p>As it happens, I was considering the general case, and the examples of URLs and SQL came from Mike Ash&#x27;s article, where he was considering the interpretation of text as information. My interpretation of cballard&#x27;s post is that he regards an URL to be primarily a string, and therefore that an NSURL is, in some way, a typed string. I didn&#x27;t think it was a good example, but as I was making a general point, I did not see that as mattering - I could make my point with Mike Ash&#x27;s general examples instead.<p>My interpretation of Mike Ash&#x27;s original statement is that it would be useful to have different string types where strings have different interpretations, and I disagree - the semantics of a type do not depend on its textual representation (if that were so, it would not be possible to translate those semantics between languages.) If I now understand your position correctly, it is that it is useful to have different string types because there are several different ways to interpret the underlying bit sequence as a valid string. I am not convinced that is the best solution to the problem created by us having incompatible bytes-as-text representations, but I agree that it is not wrong to consider it as an exception to the general rule.",1446860976
10523267,comment,10521835,10522104,0,0,vlehto,,,"It&#x27;s international thing. One of the original breeds of modernist architecture was even named &quot;international style&quot;. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Style_%28architecture%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Style_%28archite...</a><p>I have a theory why it&#x27;s like this. In 1800&#x27;s architects we&#x27;re often painters first. Their day job was to paint portraits and signs and whatever was ordered. There was quite lot of painters around, only few of them made &quot;art&quot; and only the best got to draw buildings. The architect would then work the design together with mason. Civil engineers of the time we&#x27;re busy building railroads.<p>Then at the end of the century, photography happened. In hindsight it&#x27;s called  &quot;the crisis of art!&quot;. Suddenly architects could no longer apprentice by painting stuff for customers. You needed a school for architecture. The teachers would of course be old architects, who hang out with painters. So they sucked that &quot;we can&#x27;t sell portraits anymore, let&#x27;s go crazy!&quot; attitude.<p>In the 1940&#x27;s you still had some old school guys. During this time some factory owners still thought that paying an architect was investment. You got a factory that would sell your product, keep your employers happy and make you proud. Here is factory building from that period. <a href=""http://torshammer.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Kabelfabriken+67753.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://torshammer.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Kabelfabrike...</a><p>Now architecture has not been based on anything for century. Or maybe seeping fashion trends of modern art. Most big money people use architect just to &quot;pretty up&quot; the facade of a building as afterthought. If even that. Nobody trusts architect to make anything coherent or beautiful.<p>At the same time architects need to jump on any opportunity to get some international fame. Because that&#x27;s the only way you can ever succeed with such career. This breeds eccentricity. Which makes the whole thing worse.<p>To justify not using and architect, you might word that as &quot;saving money&quot;. To be consistent with that, you cut costs in labor and materials. To the point of making actually bad buildings.",1446860965

In the past, jobs that were displaced were replaced by other forms of unskilled or minimally skilled labour. The total pool of unskilled/minimally skilled jobs never shrunk. It is still too soon to tell what effect intelligent automation will have on that total pool. It could very well be that for every job automation technology displaces, it creates ten more. But if those jobs are highly skilled jobs that the existing labour force can&#x27;t transition into? Then we have a problem.<p>4) I think that perfect employment is a good goal, but how we get there is something else entirely. We can create more jobs, we can &quot;re-educate&quot; workers, we can decrease hours to create more shifts, but all of this still leaves a lot of people in the cracks. I think that one of the main benefits of a UBI is that it guarantees that nobody falls through the cracks.<p>I don&#x27;t see how UBIs would entirely destroy labour unions either, since labour unions are often about more than setting minimum hours and negotiating standard compensations. Unions provide a lot more utility than that so I don&#x27;t see workers abandoning their unions just because they get a check in the mail from the government every month. If that was the case, the union probably had very little utility to begin with IMO.<p>I don&#x27;t know if a UBI is the right solution for solving poverty or worker inequality.

That people that tolerate ads in web pages do it only because they think it is the only way to get the content for free, not because of the value-add of the promoted advertisement.<p>2) Yes, the best thing about digital ads is the data... <i>for the marketers</i>.

You can&#x27;t hear the overtones beyond the upper portion of the hearing range (many people believe you can).<p>>In a real listening environment (i.e. live performance) these overtones have a chance to interact with one another in the air.<p>In reality they do not unless you&#x27;re driving the air so hard the trough rarification is approaching hard vacuum.

Some performances are powerful enough to get close, eg, if you&#x27;re sitting six feet from the pipe organ.<p>Once you&#x27;re driving air so hard it becomes nonlinear, thus introducing intermodulation distortion in the air, that distortion produces actual audible-range distortion products.

Inaudible ultrasonics will produce audible artifacts when the underlying reproduction system is nonlinear (another way of saying &#x27;there&#x27;s intermodulation distortion&#x27;).  However, that&#x27;s a playback artifact.

In theory, on a very clean and noiseless signal these harmonic spurs might be more audible than you&#x27;d expect from the overall quantization level.<p>In practice, 16 bits is enough precision that these harmonics are inaudible even in fairly pathlogical cases. But quantization eliminates the potential problem by replacing the harmonic content with white noise.<p>Adding noise on playback just adds noise, it would not remove the harmonic generation.<p>The _best_ kind of dithering scheme is a subtractive dither, where noise is added before quanitization and then the _same_ noise is subtracted from the dequantized signal on playback. This is best in the sense that it&#x27;s the scheme that completely eliminates the distortion with the least amount of additional noise power.

There is far more to musicality and emotion than compression.  The problem compression solves is that the environments where industrialized cultures now listen in are not dedicated listening areas, but alternately loud and quiet places, so compression makes all parts of the music almost equally loud so there are no drop outs where the quieter parts would be.  There is no need to compress music in headphones, for example, to the extent that it is currently compressed.<p>I find compression and other techniques such as removing vocal breath sounds, makes most recordings unlistenable.  They don&#x27;t sound like humans anymore, but synthetic puppets animated by humans with conflicting values.  Take the Foo Fighters, for example.  They&#x27;re popular, sure, but all of their songs sounds like one continuous din.  Between the compression induced by the guitar distortion settings and the compression added to the recording, then the compression added by the radio station, it just sounds like a waterfall with a few bandpass filters changing between the verse and chorus.<p>Also their vocals have no dynamics.  When he yells loud, the vocals don&#x27;t get louder but the timbre changes.  That changes it from cathartic to strained.  The dynamics have all been flattened.<p>Why do you think the indie rock movement and bands and styles with wide dynamic range like the Pixies, Nirvana and dubstep got so popular?  They eschewed the trend of hardline compression with alternating loud and quiet parts.

Not sure if I agree with this point.<p>2) That a basic income necessarily needs be IN PLACE OF existing welfare and labour protections... While some other forms of welfare may evaporate and some labour protections loosened, it doesn&#x27;t have to. It provides flexibility for labourers and employers to negotiate without the looming threat of not having a basic living wage. It increases the labourers negotiating position more than the employers IMO.<p>3) Technology makes us more productivity, which means we can work less hours which means we can have more leisure time. The problem with this argument is that it assumes those &quot;less hours&quot; are equally distributed across the entire pool of laborers. What it just means is there are less hours for a limited pool of skilled labourers to fight over. Which means more unemployment. It does not mean that the taxi driver who has his 12 hour days eliminated by driverless ubers now gets to work 3 hours a day driving an uber or gets to work 3 hours a day programming those cars.<p>4) Instead of having a UBI, we should have a militant (violent) revolution against the rich where we demand increased welfare and labour protections. Increased welfare like a UBI? I&#x27;m not sure why the author feels like positive social institutions can&#x27;t be a voluntary concession of the rich to satisfy discontent of the masses. Why do we have to get out our pitchforks to get bread if they are offering to hand out a livelihood to every citizen?<p>This sounds like the sort of leftist rhetoric that comes from someone in a very comfortable position.

That is, I would do the easy work of copying someone else&#x27;s work, then place the effort on their side to identify the minimum needed to be compliant, and I would only need to make those changes to be compliant.<p>Your goal therefore should be to not sound or act like a lazy copyright infringer.<p>> To be fair there were couple of content wording<p>What does suggest the project did not have a policy of avoiding copyright infringement, or at least not understanding the risks of being loose with copyright law.<p>> today my GitHub repository was suspended<p>Which GitHub is obligated to do under the DMCA. You then file a counter-claim if you have &quot;a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.&quot; Following the DMCA absolves GitHub of liability, and makes services like GitHub possible.<p>The DMCA is also good for you. Without it, the company claiming infringement might have sued you directly, rather than talk to GitHub and go through the takedown process first.<p>> I am wondering where the line when somebody can just come and claim your project to be a clone and request it to be suspended?...<p>That line is called the DMCA. It&#x27;s been around since 1998. Github has a guide to what it means, and why they follow the law. It&#x27;s linked to from the github message on your repo.<p>Nor is it a &quot;just&quot;. The take down is filed under penalty of perjury. Misuse can be subject to criminal and civil prosecution.",1446858079

They have not been constructed with the same budget and not to achieve the same goal. Clearly a dorm aims to lower the cost to an extreme, exactly the opposite of what a bank would do.",1446858057

But it seems his hypothesis is that the contracts mostly have wage increases which long term will force the companies to invest in productivity-boosting technology to scale instead of just getting more labour.",1446858009

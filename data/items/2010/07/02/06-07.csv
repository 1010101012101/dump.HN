They've got a lot more to do in the months ahead, and I'm looking forward to following along.<p>As an aside, it's interesting to see how similar their message passing protocol is to one I'm beginning to plan out, though for a completely different application. Kinda like a ""push to origin; fetch from origin"" (from git).<p>EDIT: And hmm, every time Diaspora comes up, people start to say something about a ""hype cycle"" or something. I don't really know what that is, but it's rather obnoxious.<p>How about we don't take every mention of Diaspora as an invitation to count the ways they're sure to fail; because of the hypecycle or motorhyper or the gnarly-toothed funderrazer…etc.<p>To me, this is an interesting update about a curious project.

In many contexts, especially where there is high noise to signal, people will tend to believe/bet on/buy/hire/have sex with the guy who seems so (possibly over-) confident and makes lots of (possibly empty) promises over the guy who is humble and annoyingly realistic. I can't remember which firm but the leader of a cosmetics firm once said ""we don't sell lipstick. we sell hope."" I think that's true for lots of social interactions. So this attitude is better to have as a hat one can take on or off, depending on the situation. If you're alone or dealing with knowledgable people, yes, wear your humble hat. If you're selling something or yourself, wear the other one. Just to be clear, I don't like it how it is. But at the moment, being intentionally misleading sometimes, even to the point of eating your own BS, is a valid strategy for worldly success if that is what you seek.<p>EDIT: Just to be clear, what I mean by ""intentionally misleading"" is more like hyperbole than like lying.

The mechanical design makes it seem very elegant.If it were a schottky bridge, it'll still have a forward drop of ~0.3 - 0.45 volts, which is pretty big for 1.5 volts batteries.",1278051141

But I think my principal had to field calls from confused parents.<p>""lying""<p>Right, you wouldn't want to betray their trust.  However, my personality and teaching style led me to ""pull their leg"" every so often which I think is quite age-appropriate for 8th-graders.  That's right at the age where the brain is developing new types of abstract thinking, and so the occasional tongue-in-cheek communication really exercises their brain well and if done well can establish a playful rapport with the students.  I found that this doesn't work with 6th-graders, though.  They are still rather concrete in their thinking.",1278051112

I was surprised to find many people saying that if they followed Derek's advice it would harm their self-esteem. Assuming that others possess more skill than you does not diminish the value of your own skill. I don't think it is a zero sum game. I think the biggest realization for me recently is just that one should not underestimate people. It is easy to think that others (especially faceless others) aren't as good at something as you are. To quote the late great George Carlin ""Have you ever noticed that anybody driving slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac?"" It is depressingly easy to judge, and usually we judge negatively, and usually we judge wrong.",1278051069

If you're assigning people a competence percentage, then it's quite possible for a large portion of drivers to be above average (e.g. a thousand drivers that are 75% competent and a hundred drivers that are 25% competent).  People often throw out the claim that ""remember, half of everyone is below average,"" which implies a contiguous ordinal ranking for all people, in which case ""average"" is the same as ""median.""",1278050866

So if a cell's positive endcap isn't perfectly flat, it would be likely to make contact with both terminals at that end, which would short out the whole cell.<p>IMO, Microsoft's patent attorneys are only the first of many attorneys you'll be paying if you implement this scheme in a mass-marketable consumer device.",1278050786
1480363,comment,1480118,1480332,0,0,techiferous,,,"First, some more context.  This was an 8th grade middle school physical science class.  Here are some excerpts from a worksheet I gave them:<p>""Many people believe things based only on what they hear other people say, not based on real evidence.  This makes it easy for people to have misconceptions (wrong beliefs).  One common misconception is that the Earth is a sphere.  The majority of Americans believe this in spite of the evidence to the contrary.<p>""The Earth is actually a disc (circle).  The sky is a dome above the Earth.  The sun, moon, and stars are all attached to this dome.  The dome rotates, giving us day and night.  Underneath the Earth there is water.  Around the edges of the Earth is a vast, impenetrable ice sheet.  The north pole is at the center of the Earth.<p>...<p>""Point #7:  The United Nations’ logo correctly shows the shape of the Earth.  Since they are the supreme governing body of the Earth, they should know how it is shaped!<p>...<p>""Point #9:  This one you can try yourself!  If the Earth is a sphere, then the ground must be slightly curved.  This means that the floors of buildings must be slightly curved.  Lay a ball or a pen on the floor.  Does it roll?<p>""Point #10:  If the Earth is a spinning sphere, then all of the water in the oceans would be flung into space!<p>...So you get the point.  If I had more time, I would have made the lesson more compelling.<p>Most students exhibited some form of cognitive disequilibrium.  About half ended up going along with the concept of a flat earth.  About half were skeptical.  A few, especially one student, got quite interested and came back at me the next day with lots of evidence and reasons to the contrary.  So it had the intended result for at least a few students.  And at the end of it all I think most got the point that we should rely on evidence, not simply what people say.",1278050749

Anyone can (attempt to) do this patch, including the library authors, the browser authors (who may be the same people), or any other users of the library.<p>If upstream don&#x27;t accept such patches, and repeatedly indulge in such uncooperative behaviour, there is always the option to fork (and, in the process, perhaps strip out the parts which the browser doesn&#x27;t need to make maintenance easier).<p>As an aside, the situation you describe sounds a lot like the Firefox/Iceweasel drama in Debian!",1446818353

(That is, they have decided that patent protection requires disclosure but copyright protection does not.)  A few other countries may disagree, but the whole point of TPP is to harmonize disagreements because (it is claimed) the frictions they introduce are worse than the micro-optimizations that individual states make.<p>Incidentally, in <i>practice</i> these sorts of disclosure agreements are used by states like China for protectionist reasons, not as part of some open-source ideal.",1446818345

Document or Relational: I can see different apps preferring one or the other.<p>Two things are interesting to me:<p>1. What&#x27;s the consistency model? Is NoSQL really NoTxns? Whether you need transactions or not probably affects your decision more than tables vs docs. Similarly if you still want some partial functionality in the face of larger failures, maybe forgoing consistency is worth it. (Note that some NoSQL systems support strong consistency and some relational systems don&#x27;t).<p>2. Is your query language as powerful as SQL? First, SQL is not a great language, but it&#x27;s probably still better than whatever your NoSQL store is using, once you move beyond CRUD and very simple filtering. Declarative queries with an optimizer is the right choice for most applications. The expressiveness once you get to &quot;group by&quot;, joins and subqueries is difficult to replicate in a programatic query language.<p>You may not <i>like</i> SQL. That&#x27;s fair. But there&#x27;s a reason it seemingly can&#x27;t be kept down. See CQL, Impala, SparkSQL, F1/Spanner, Presto, etc...

Could improve, but pretty great already in choice of colors and layout.  (&quot;Dehydrated urine&quot; for a simple gold color? Seriously? Stop watching watersports.)<p>Being 100% free software as in GNU, meaning being entirely free of uninspectable binary blobs, and working hard to make the system easily improvable and amendable by the user community, <i>is</i> a big deal.  Deal with it.  GNU aims for people for whom these are important criteria.<p>The features listed in the second point are based in concepts that are nontrivial to grok.  There is no short way to explain them on an intro front page, but not mentioning them would be silly since they <i>are</i> what sets Guix apart from standard package managers (which ironically is what you request being listed).  Maybe you should look up the meanings of those terms instead of straight out assuming they&#x27;re marketing buzz.  Transactional updates, and unprivileged/user-level package management are pretty big deals.  Likewise, providing clean APIs in a high-level programming/scripting language is very much a big deal; see how easily a web front-end could be made for Guix.<p>Redirecting newcomers to Nix would just add an unnecessary layer of indirection.  The name is clearly a homage to Nix, and also otherwise &quot;everybody knows&quot; that Guix is Guile+Nix, so claiming there&#x27;s malicious intent in leaving out a mention of Nix would be just silly.  And Guix is not a Guile wrapper around Nix; it has an entirely different package recipe format and database.  You don&#x27;t use Guix to work with a Nix system; rather the Guix system uses a low-level component taken from Nix.  Casual users don&#x27;t <i>need</i> to know anything about Nix.<p>Lastly, functional package management brings immense pragmatic benefits (source-binary correspondence, reliability of transactional updates, etc.), i.e. it&#x27;s not simply a dogmatic application of FP concepts to package management.  You&#x27;ll note that Guix uses Scheme, not Haskell.  I think most people interested in functional package management are so for the practical benefits, so I think you have a pretty wrong image of those folks.<p>All in all, please make sure you have a proper understanding of a topic before making such inflammatory remarks.  It doesn&#x27;t help anyone.",1446817666

Especially since I can stop using marijuana to get through a hard problem, where opiate pain management plans require a constant level.

If you&#x27;ve invested in more than, say, 100 startups, you have a big enough sample to check this... this requires knowing the size of application pools, and who was accepted though.<p><i></i>3.<i></i> I believe that in general it&#x27;s not possible to determine a bias from the kind of aggregate statistic pg is discussing without at least some knowledge of the sample space.<p>For example, using OP&#x27;s method, you will find that almost every selection process in the world is biased <i>for</i> you if you divide the world as {you} vs {non-yous} (you&#x27;re doing significantly worse than the best non-you). And find that almost every selection process in the world is heavily biased <i>against</i> you if you use the minimum statistic (you&#x27;re doing significantly better than the worst non-you). This is also true for smallish groups (eg {your friends} vs {not your friends}).<p>The same is true for PG&#x27;s method -- it&#x27;s highly unlikely that {you} fall exactly at the average value of {non-yous}, or that {your friends} fall exactly at the average of {not your friends}.<p><i></i>4.<i></i> I believe that the math here is distracting from the core question.<p>Core question 1: Do men and women on average make the same choices?<p>If you believe that, then determining bias is easy: we already know who the investor funded. Is the number of men the investor funded different from the number of women? Yes? Then the investor is biased. This is much more direct than the the kind of forensic accounting pg is proposing.<p>I suspect that pg didn&#x27;t propose this test because pg doesn&#x27;t believe that men and women on average make the same choices. He knows, for example, that the number of female applicants to YC is different than the number of male applicants (a gendered difference in behavior). Google &quot;men and women career choices&quot; or similar if you&#x27;re interested in learning more, or better yet, read some first person accounts from FTM men about the cognitive effects of taking testosterone.<p>Since it&#x27;s clear that there&#x27;s a gendered difference <i>before</i> applying to YC, it seems very difficult to justify an assumption there would be no gendered difference in behavior <i>after</i> applying to YC (or any other investment firm, FirstRound in this case). Given that, the question we were asking becomes much more confusing... a simple bias towards ideas and plans you understand/agree with/are excited by is a gender bias in as much as your gender caused you to like the idea or plan. Removing that bias (supporting plans you understand less, agree with less, or are less excited by) seems like an obviously bad idea.<p>Returning to the problem: if we accept that this sort of &quot;makes sense to me bias&quot; can be observed when looking for gender biases, we are left in a really hard place. That bias seems to be both a good thing, and confounds the entire analysis. Unless you&#x27;ve controlled for the &quot;makes sense&quot; bias, such analysis will apply pressure for investors to waste money from their perspective. This seems obviously bad.<p>Core question 2: which biases do we want investors to have?<p>Investors who knowingly pass up good opportunities on the basis of the founder&#x27;s gender are punishing themselves worse than any company they pass over -- their competitors who aren&#x27;t gender biased will get higher returns, and so will have more money to invest in the future. This is to say that gender biases for startup investing are self-correcting. The investors already have their self-interest maximally aligned with not being sexist.<p>I don&#x27;t pretend to know which companies are worth investing in more than any other smart technologist. I also don&#x27;t pretend to know to what extent gender differences cause differences in returns, so my answer is: investors should be as biased (selective about investing) as they see fit. Startups are positive sum for society, and anyone who can find a way to fund more of them profitably is making the world better.<p>In large part, this is because I find it very unlikely that any modern investor is knowingly sexist -- I think it&#x27;s much more likely that the sort of &quot;makes sense&quot; bias I discuss above is at play.<p>Of course, this is an early thought that came from first principals, so counter arguments solicited. Perhaps there is something deeply evil about passing over startups you don&#x27;t feel comfortable investing in (assuming that comfort has any correlation with founder gender), or perhaps there&#x27;s some easy fix which makes previously dicy-looking ideas from {other-gender} founders look like obviously good investments. (If you know what that idea is, I&#x27;d love to know it too).<p>5. Thanks to both pg and Chris for the fun math/philosophy problem. :)",1446816280

To me, using an external library sounds like a good idea because:<p>- You get code separation. A bit less code on the main Firefox repo, and a repo dedicated only to BMP decoding (or image files in general). Someone who wants to contribute to the BMP decoder wouldn&#x27;t need to download all FF repo and understand/configure its build system. Big plus!<p>- The library can be shared among different applications. It doesn&#x27;t make sense for each browser to have a different implementation of BMP decoding, each with their own bugs. Sharing a library for this kind of stuff would actually benefit security, as a bug fixed by one browser/app developer would benefit the others.<p>That last one is the biggest thing for me. The BMP example is a very simple one, and not very important. It is in more complex tasks that i think sharing libraries would be much more beneficial.<p>For example, wouldn&#x27;t it be great that, instead duplicating so much effort in implementing the streaming capabilities of Media Source Extensions [1], the different browsers shared a library dedicated to that complex task? We could have had a more complete and robust implementation in less total time! And that&#x27;s just one example; there are tons of complex things browsers do that could be extracted to separate shared libraries.<p>[1]: And so many bugs <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=778617"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=778617</a>",1446815211

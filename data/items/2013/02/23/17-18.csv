[Edit: To be clear re apt-get -- macports, homebrew, cygwin etc are just not apt enough.]<p>- I still hope Unity gets better than Gnome 2 and will e.g. run the devices that replaces my iPhone/iPad.

OSX has never been perfect and has always had quirks. iTunes has never been a flawless interface and missteps happened while Steve was there (mobile me, etc). People seem to be misremembering apple as being perfect while Steve was there. For the most part, the people that make macs/iPhones, etc are the same as when Steve was there. Sure Steve was a great inspirer of polish and set the bar high, but he didn't create these things. Apple hasn't gone to shit since be died. I'm not even sure you could really say their trajectory has changed since he left.

Getting stuff shipped here is very hard and finding ""Ubuntu-friendly hardware"" is simply not an easy option, at all. I find it odd that Ubuntu is purportedly an answer for those who live in rural or remote areas, yet those are the areas where it can be extremely difficult, or expensive, to get specialized Linux-friendly hardware.<p>2) I've spent lots of time digging through documentation, reading about packages and messing with various pieces of Linux over the years. I am constantly SSHing around to various boxes for development and administration. I'm no stranger to config files, man pages, or Linux.<p>3) As I grow older, I'm finding that my time is definitely equatable to money. This is especially true as a freelancer. There was absolutely a thorough amount of ""is this worth it"" over the course of months, if not years, before taking the plunge.<p>Ultimately: the time and frustration investment reached a threshold where throwing money at the solution became a viable and intelligent alternative for me.

I used a variant called ""Goobuntu"" (guess where...) during my tenure at one particular company, and it was a mixed bag.  I'm not sure how much was due to Ubuntu itself and how much was from the local meddling, but it was wonky in ways my Linux boxes normally aren't.<p>Put it this way - my machine at work was some beastly multi-proc Pentium 4 something or other, and my machine at home was some random gunk I put together using old parts from Micro Center.  It was so old, I had to special order the CPU online because nobody in town still had them in stock.  I live in the valley, and could drive to AMD in under 15 minutes.  That's just nuts.<p>Still, my machine at home was far more responsive than my workstation ever was.  There were tons of weird glitchy times where it would just sit there and lag for no apparent reason.  I didn't even get the worst of it, since I ran a minimal window manager.  People who went for the full-on ""desktop environment"" (KDE? GNOME? whatever it was on that distribution, I don't know) had even more anomalies.<p>When I hit my hotkey to pop open an X terminal and don't get my shell prompt in a blink of an eye, something is very wrong.<p>Edit: forgot something.

I don't have a credit card, so I needed the help of google for creating an account without one. Macports now installed several additional versions of llvm and gcc. Under Linux this is just a <package-manager> octave<p>- I wanted to use Inkscape and Gimp (No I won't buy photoshop for the extreme few occasions that I need to edit pictures). Inkscape doesn't find X11 when starting and Gimp has the problem that the compress dialog for pngs spawns under the main window.<p>- Old versions of Software. No python3 ssh-copy-id or java7 by default.<p>- Package management is really broken when something isn't in the app store. You can't uninstall X11. You need to keep the virtualbox installer .dmg to be able to uninstall it. Virtualbox in macports didn't work by the way.<p>- I have to use the command line to mount a disk with ntfs-3g, because writing to ntfs doesn't work out of the box.<p>- Everybody wants my to pay for basic things that were solved decades ago.

A VM for database, a VM for memcache, a VM for my app server, just like in production.  I don't typically do this, but it's possible.<p>On top of all that, I can snapshot my various VMs so easily.  I no longer have to worry about really messing something up with a custom build.  If somehow I just destroy something, restore is a click away and takes seconds.<p>Additionally, with web work, while services like BrowserStack are very good to have I can do this natively in Windows w/o viewing pages through flash.

SKS is developed in OCaml.<p>I've been porting the reconciliation algorithm in SKS to Golang so Hockeypuck can peer with SKS servers. I think it will be very useful in other applications beyond keyservers. The mathematical definitions of finite fields and polynomials are elegant in OCaml, and I definitely understand the choice of language from that point-of-view.<p>If you want to see a comparison of finite-field arithmetic and polynomial factoring in Go vs OCaml, my recon port is in a separate project called conflux (<a href=""https://github.com/cmars/conflux"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cmars/conflux</a>). It's an incomplete work in progress, needs tightening up, tail-call elimination, etc. but early feedback is welcome.<p>As a developer unfamiliar with OCaml & without much formal mathematics background, I had a hard time understanding some of the intent of the SKS sources -- in those cases, conflux is a straight-up port from OCaml with unit-tests also ported from SKS to back it up.

""<p>It was once much easier: IIRC  in the ""Death Wish"" movie series, Charles Bronson's character obtains his firearms via mail-order. Today it's a more involved process:<p>TO PURCHASE A FIREARM FROM AN FFL DEALER:<p>The buyer must complete and sign a ""4473 form"" verifying his fitness to own a firearm (to lie is a crime). The buyer must provide identification information (e.g., driver's license).  The dealer phones the federal National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). NICS is given the buyer information plus the fact that the purchase is either a long gun or a handgun (no firearm serial numbers, etc. are given to NICS). NICS does a background check and either allows or disallows the sale. The buyer pays the dealer and is given the firearm. Afterward, in a separate ""bound-book"", the dealer records the 4473 info along with the firearms' identifying information. The 4473 forms and the bound-book are kept forever and, if the dealer goes out of business, those records are given to the government.<p><a href=""http://www.atf.gov/applications/e4473/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.atf.gov/applications/e4473/</a><p><a href=""http://www.atf.gov/firearms/faq/atf-f-4473.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.atf.gov/firearms/faq/atf-f-4473.html</a><p>So to form a registry of all purchased firearms in the USA would require linking the NICS information (which legally is mandated to be destroyed after a short period of time) with the 4473 information. Federal gun control laws have driven relentlessly toward that goal (combined NICS + 4473 = firearms registration) all the while saying that a firearms registry is fantasy. But there's more...<p>TO PURCHASE A FIREARM FROM AN INDIVIDUAL:<p>The buyer must provide proof to the seller that he may legally purchase a firearm in that state. This varies from state to state but usually consists of the buyer showing a driver's license from that state and then stating that he may legally own a firearm (essentially the questions on the 4473 form must be accounted for). To lie is a crime. No NICS check is performed and no records need be kept.<p>This latter transaction is often termed the ""Gun Show Loophole"" although it can occur anywhere (no gun show is required). It is a private firearms transfer between private individuals: not dealer to customer, or customer to dealer. It is termed a ""loophole"" by anti-gunners because it prevents tracing firearms' with the combined NICS + 4473 information: it would  render a firearms registry at least partially incomplete.<p>So today we are two steps away from full firearms registration:<p>- eliminate private firearms transfers between private individuals,<p>- allow the government to collect and keep forever all NICS and 4473 information.<p>PROBLEMS<p>- It is unknown whether the (passed) NICS check information is discarded after 24 hours as is mandated by law (a failed NICS check is kept longer for investigation since it indicates a crime may has been committed). One who was thorough would inquire as to the logging and backup systems used by NICS. Worst case: ATF has all NICS check data in a database.<p>- 4473 form information may be destroyed after 20 years. However the dealer's bound-book must be given to a business' new owner or handed over to the ATF when the business closes. Worst case: ATF has lots of 4473 information in a database.<p>- There have apparently been instances where the ATF scanned (illegally) dealers' 4473 forms en masse during audits.<p>- Worst case overall: ATF (illegally) has a combined NICS + 4473 database which is a partial registry of legally-purchased firearms in the USA.",1361640265

This is wrong in two ways:<p>(1) I did say what was wrong with the thought experiment. You just don't want to accept that what I said is right. Of course that's your decision to make, but the fact that you don't agree with my criticism doesn't mean I didn't make one.<p>(2) Your view of how things work in these kinds of arguments is backasswards. Extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence. You are making an extraordinary claim: that the theory of General Relativity, which has been developed and refined and tested against evidence for almost a century now, and which has passed every test with flying colors, somehow has a basic error of logic in one of its fundamental principles. For a comprehensive study of how well tested GR is experimentally, see here:<p><a href=""http://relativity.livingreviews.org/Articles/lrr-2001-4/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://relativity.livingreviews.org/Articles/lrr-2001-4/</a><p>The burden of proof is on <i>you</i> to back up this extraordinary claim. You don't do that by making or referring to a quick blog post that makes elementary errors and misstatements about what GR actually says. You do that the way Galileo and Einstein did it: by having extremely detailed knowledge of the theory you are attacking--knowing it <i>better</i> than its proponents--and by making sure that <i>every single thing</i> you say about that theory is correct <i>according to its proponents</i>. It's up to <i>you</i> to dot every i and cross every t and dig into the textbooks and the literature to make sure you are representing the theory correctly.<p>You have not even come close to doing all that, and neither has the author of the blog post. When I see elementary misstatements like the ones you and the blog post author have made, that tells me it's not even worth my time to read through the blog post in detail to try to figure out what's wrong with it, because it's not even wrong. That happens quite a bit on PF as well; the things you think are ""rarely really answered"" there are examples of the same kind of not even wrongness.<p>For the specific scenario under discussion here, this is what extraordinary evidence would look like: you would be able to construct, in detail, the local inertial frame in question, centered around the event of an infalling observer just crossing the horizon. By ""construct, in detail"", I mean you would be able to draw a spacetime diagram of it showing all the curves of interest: the horizon itself, the worldlines of all objects, curves of constant radial coordinate r, etc. You would also be able to exhibit the mathematical transformation from the coordinates in the local inertial frame to and from a global coordinate chart, such as the Painleve chart. And you would be able to exhibit the mathematical equations that give the size of the local inertial frame, and demonstrate, mathematically, that the event of two cloud particles crossing (one that starts inside the horizon and one that starts outside) must happen within that size. (When I do this computation, I find that the crossing event <i>cannot</i> happen within the LIF--the distance that would be required for the two particles to meet is much, much larger than the distance the LIF can cover. If you want to prove me wrong, first you have to get to that point, and you have given me no evidence that you have done so.)",1361639911

HTML -> XHTML might happen once IE < 9 becomes irrelevant, but I doubt it.<p>But, in the case of JS, there's one major practical constraints: Introducing a new language must not regress performance of JS. (Why? There's an absolute ton of JS on the web. Getting 1% of the web using a new language able to be quicker doesn't matter if you regress 99% of the web.)<p>You may think, ""Sure, that's easy. You just add a second VM, entirely disjoint from JS!"". Unfortunately, it's not that easy: if you allow the languages to coexist in the same page, you then need to GC across both languages (as some objects are shared between the two runtimes, primarily those relating to the DOM), and cross-VM GC is an active research area, where nothing has been shown without at least a 10% performance hit to both GC impls.<p>Well, then, how about having a ""generic"" VM that runs JS within it? You're going to have an uphill battle to get performance equal to current JS VMs, because their bytecode (ignoring V8 for now!) encodes a lot of high-level semantics of JS, which means any new language, to have good performance, would have to share a lot of semantics with JS. This inevitably puts massive limitations on what any new language can be like, and restricts it to being ""JS-esque"".<p>So what can we do? There are two basic options: subset JS, though inevitably this doesn't sort out things like `==` v. `===`, but you can get to something where you can statically check you're using a sane subset (e.g., not using `==`, not using any undefined variables, etc.); or, write some language not overly dissimilar to JS and compile down to JS (the ""not overly dissimilar"" restriction is a practical necessity as you can't really afford to send large language runtimes and standard libraries over the wire). In both cases, JS is ultimately the target thus it's important to keep on fixing what can be fixed with JS (e.g., the lack of a module system, the lack of memory-efficient data structures), but both can improve the situation over unrestricted JS as it is today.",1361639525

I don't work in Windows but I know a few folks that do. I haven't heard any stories of people feeling they got shafted and some doofus got a reward, but I am sure it happens, and I am sure it is not unique to Microsoft in any way. My argument is with people that claim it is the norm and they base that on their own (non-verifiable) experience, or worse on some troll blog like miniMSFT.<p>As for comments about seeing who got rewards based on title change, a title change doesn't always mean a large pay raise, and there are hidden rewards like gold star bonuses and HiPo groups that have little/no outward evidence, unless the recipient starts talking about them (which they tell them not to do), so I would say you probably aren't seeing accurate signaling based on job titles alone. The fact that some of the best rewards are secret is one of my beefs with the system.<p>Also, to clarify, I am not a fan of Microsoft's system, but when I hear stories of people who claim it leads to internecine wars, well that just isn't my experience in the last 8 years, or the experience of anyone I have talked to personally.<p>Ultimately there has to be some kind of ranking system as there is a fixed pool of rewards. The only alternative I could see would be exactly even sharing amongst a team. You could argue for that, but even as someone that has socialist sympathies I don't think it would work or be fair. There are people on my team that produce more than me, whether it be through being smarter, working longer hours, whatever. To say I should get the same reward as them is just wrong.<p>So if we agree there has to be ranking, well there's your stack ranking. You could argue with the curve fitting, but your claim that 1 in a group of 10 would get no bonus is just false. Curve fitting doesn't happen on a per team basis. It's more like 10 in a group of 100 or 100 in a group of 1000. There is nothing saying that an entire team couldn't end up in the top 10% of rewards. It may well be the case that on your team of 10 superstars one doesn't get the reward they feel they deserve, but that is because someone else in the calibration meeting was deemed more worthy, your teams ranking isn't done in isolation and in a team with 10 superstars there can be other superstars in the general vicinity, even more than 10. To claim that the system results in people plotting against the ones they are ranked against in order to sabotage them just sounds like conspiracy theory thinking. In my experience it results in people upping their game, or leaving if they feel they are unappreciated. Both are reasonable responses, some attempt at sabotage is not.",1361639250

3663968,comment,3661947,3663168,8,0,SiVal,,,"This is a great question, and the answer is that universities serve their own institutional needs, not those of business, or of society, or even of students. I remember the shock when I was in college trying to learn Japanese and I asked why, after the first couple of years of language, all the Japanese classes switched to literature or obscure linguistics. I told them that I wanted classes in advanced language that would teach me how to live and work at a professional level in Japan: present in a business meeting, read a contract, etc. I claimed that going from basic language to advanced, modern, professional Japanese was a lot higher priority than a switch to archaic, literary Japanese or obscure linguistic analysis. They reacted with outrage, claiming that if they were to do what I was suggesting, they ""wouldn't have any academic credibility at all!""<p>Ah, that's what it's about. Not my needs but theirs: not real-world skill but academic credibility.<p>Of course it would be what I needed if, and only if, I intended to become an academic in the field myself, but that is what universities are---farm leagues for finding and developing future professors.<p>Since professors are only a small portion of the work force, most people weren't even supposed to attend universities. Most people were supposed to enroll in other educational programs (tech schools, art/cooking/etc. academies, apprenticeships, and so on) if they intended to work for a living.<p>But these days, no employer wants you without a university degree, so universities can go on serving themselves and you'll pay for it anyway, because the end for non-professors is a general purpose ""degree"" credential that employers use as a proxy for generic employment qualification.<p>I'm not saying that computer science isn't important, just that it is a higher priority for academia than for business, and academia serves academia.",1330894779

The regulatory burden on nuclear power is psychotically out of proportion to its actual safety risk and environmental impact, and gives an unfair advantage to energy sources like coal and methane which are much dirtier and more dangerous. Beyond a certain point, safety regulations on nuclear power make us less safe. We're well past that point.<p>(Regarding pebble beds: China has an experimental pebble bed plant under construction. Each module consists of two 105 MWe reactors sharing the same turbomachinery for generating electricity.

It's not actively going ""Oh this user has swapped to an Android device, let's piss him off in every way possible and treat this text as an iMessage, that'll get him!"", it's working with the data it has in an attempt to be helpful to the receiver: they've run out of PAYG credit and can no longer sustain a data connection, but are in range of WiFi, so iMessage still stays online. It is trying to be helpful to the user, not a massive wanker<p>Admittedly, they should check to see if a SIM card is still in the phone on boot, then register with iMessage<p>In comparison to BBM, the only reason this is considered ""lock-in"" is because texts and iMessages are in the same place instead of two separate places<p>Disable iMessage and turn the damn iPhone off for a week, then if that fails, run to an Apple Store<p>Also, don't assume the worst, you will somewhere along the line regret it, and wonder ""what if"".

For posterity's sake, my original response was something along the lines of this:<p>---<p>I think you may be overestimating the effects of ""the greater security picture"" involving community, observant neighbors, other monitoring systems for the average community. For example, my first startup was RateMyStudentRental.com, and as I recall adding automated motion-activated sensors and lighting actually had a negative effect on break-in protection. As in, adding such a system actually increased your chances of having a break-in. According to the study, neighbors don't actually pay much attention to someone standing at a well-lit door (mileage varying based on the specific community obviously).<p>---<p>ORIGINAL EDIT: I won't comment on the technicality of the differences between the analogous situation and the actual situation at hand; the differences have nothing to do with the point being made. Don't get caught up in the analogy, because it's just an analogy.<p>In case it wasn't clear the first time around, the entire point of the analogy was that, breaking into and vandalizing someone's business just to show them that it can be done is generally a bad idea.

For example, he complains that the startup sequence is ""written in C,"" so the only way to change it is to recompile systemd itself. This is utter nonsense; systemd uses tiny config files called units to configure everything, so there is no reason to recompile. It's hard to take these complaints seriously when the author clearly hasn't used the thing he's complaining about, or ever read the man page.<p>A few months ago, I actually installed systemd on my laptop to see what the fuss was about. It was one of the best things I've ever done. Before systemd, system bootup was controlled by a bunch of shell scripts that made no sense to me; if I wanted to add a new daemon, my only hope was to copy-paste a similar-looking script from /etc/rc.d. Now, my bootup is controlled by a bunch of trivial config files like this:<p><pre><code>  [Unit]
  Description=My Daemon
  
  [Service]
  ExecStart=/usr/bin/mydaemon --some --flags
</code></pre>
So, this idea that systemd somehow makes the system more complicated is utterly false; systemd is a great simplification from an admin's point of view. Sure, the systemd daemon might be a bit larger than the classic init daemon, but RAM is cheap these days and admin's time is not. I think this is a good tradeoff.",1330892977

Door locks on houses are ineffective. Think about it. Your house is covered with windows, which are made of glass. Glass is really easy to break. I mean really easy. If you found out your neighbor didn't have a house alarm, you might talk to them and tell them they should get one. If they didn't get one, would you then break into their house one night and walk into their bedroom to show them how dangerous it is?<p>OK, who knows, maybe you have a weird relationship with your neighbor. Furthermore, this is an imperfect analogy, because here, Rails and Github are both responsible for other people's property.<p>But now imagine it's a business across town and that you don't actually know the business owner. If you broke into their business to show them their building's security vulnerabilities, you bet your ass they would press charges and I don't think anyone would blame them. Even if you're doing it with the best intentions, it's still vandalism at best.<p>All of that being said, this is a very effective way of making your point and getting people to fix the problem. That doesn't make it right.

I thought I was pretty alone in that thinking, but based on your rant above, I'm not 100% on my own.  I've gotten used to Grails/GORM, which has its own set of issues, for sure, but has always felt more natural.",1330891676

One thing that jumped out at me was ""Dont engage in a needless dance where developers have to take several steps to do a single action.""<p>I think if you want to follow the ""rule of least surprise"" from the unix school of thought, this is probably a somewhat dangerous suggestion. Having one call go and do several things can make that call become something of a black box. It kind of breaks the rule of transparency as well. If I find myself having to do a dance with the API, as the end user there's nothing stopping me from writing my own helper code to group those common calls together; I'd prefer an API with total transparency and the least amount of surprise, which is ultimately more flexible.",1330891582

The thing is that the iPhone when first activated reads the number from the SIM card/carrier and sets that up as an iMessage address. Apple is never pinged when you move your number away from your carrier unless you re-activate your phone with a different SIM card (I still am not happy you can't activate the phone without having a carrier plan ... yay Jailbreaks!).<p>In the article he mentions unregistering his devices/phone from Apple's website, that will work until the next time that his phone pings the iMessage server and re-registers itself (disable iMessage first ... it unregisters the device). I personally would say that is working as designed, if I unregister all of my devices, if I turn one on to use for texting it should re-register itself automatically.",1330891480
3663768,comment,3662906,3663355,7,0,psykotic,,,"> In fact, bit shifting is always faster than anything.<p>This is overly simplistic. A fixed bitwise mapping is simple wiring and about as fast as anything can be, yes. Extending that, the ""fastest"" 32-bit shifter might be to put down 31 circuits, one for each possible shift amount. But that still requires a mux tree to select between the different circuits, which already goes beyond simple wiring.<p>While that might be the minimum-delay implementation, it's also very area inefficient. A more area-efficient design would be to cascade lg(32) = 5 muxed shifters, one for each bit in the shift amount. For example, x << 19 is the same as ((x << 16) << 2) << 1. If you read a VLSI design textbook, you'll see that there are all kinds of low-level tricks for designing barrel shifters, especially when it comes to layout.<p>Finally, the practical reality for programmers is that variable-amount shifts and rotates are relatively expensive on quite a few processors.",1330891449

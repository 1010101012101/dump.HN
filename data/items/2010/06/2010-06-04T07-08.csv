""-webkit-"" is called a ""CSS vendor prefix"" and the idea is this: If the standard changes before it’s finalized — it does happen — but Safari just implemented ""transform"" and not ""-webkit-transform"", then sites created in the interim could be stuck with broken CSS, retroactively.  Mozilla did this forever ago with ""-moz-border-radius"" rounded corners.  Even Microsoft started using the ""-ms-"" vendor prefix.<p>Apple using ""-webkit-"" is actually preserves the ""open"" and ""standards"" parts of ""open standards"".

Apple (or Mozilla, or Opera, or Microsoft) decides it would be nice if the web stack could do X.<p>2. Apple devises a property and syntax, implements it internally, evaluates performance hits, iterates, etc.<p>3.

Apple drafts a spec (no ""-webkit-"") and submits it to relevant standards bodies<p>5. Standards bodies, browser makers, and document authors weigh in<p>6.

In all fairness, I think they do if other people haven't said anything else about it. But in even more fairness, perhaps other people (specifically the working groups) should make it more clear about whether or not you can target specific browsers.<p>If you want to do things progressively, there should be a feature matrix, and as more and more enhancements are fully implemented in all major browsers, one shouldn't be able to specify which browser you must use.<p>It's probably just my ignorance.

1403706,comment,1402475,1403354,0,0,dkokelley,,,"A couple of interesting points you bring up, although probably not by intention:<p>A: An MBA is a credential, not necessarily a skill or set of skills. Earning an MBA is applying yourself to learn a set of skills, and then convincing the instructing organization you have learned the skills. Why get an MBA if you can circumvent it and just learn the skills? Why even bother with the superfluous skills and instead only learn the necessary skills on the job (and get paid for it)? With your MBA you can convince someone that you have some set of business skills, and that you are capable of applying yourself.<p>B: There is a different culture of employment relationships between America and say, Japan. In Japan, you are typically employed by the same company for life. Job hopping is rare, and there is a lot of loyalty in the employee-employer relationship. Why would you get an MBA in such a culture? You can surely learn the necessary skills on the job, and you most likely will not be leaving the company to find a better opportunity. Branching off from point A that an MBA is a credential, it follows that such a credential is not needed as much if you aren't planning on using it to unlock external opportunities. The flip side to this is that in America, an individual might find themselves working 2 or even 3 'careers' in their lifetime, and job hopping isn't considered disloyal, it's being aggressive. A credential is much more important to someone in this culture, as they will need it to convince new employers to hire them.<p>A counterpoint I want to bring up in support of an MBA is that an MBA readies you for the job you may have 5 years from now. You indicated that the necessary skills could be learned on the job. But training a new manager is expensive and risky. First, the manager must take the time to learn the tools, making him or her less effective. Second, there is the risk that this person is simply not management material, and that the investment will be wasted. Having an MBA shows (in theory) that the candidate is management material, and in fact has already learned many of the necessary skills. A company looking for a manager gets to know that this candidate is more likely to work out for them.<p>Finally, you said <i>""If a person cannot learn that on those skills on the job, I seriously would question his/her ability to be an effective manager.""</i> The actual purpose of the MBA degree is to show that the candidate does have the capacity to be an effective manager. Again, it's a credential that is designed to remove the risk of a poor hiring decision.",1275635452

US is measurably wealthier than both of these countries, at least in terms of GDP per capita. Maybe US large companies are more efficient.<p>But even if assume large companies in those countries are similarly efficient, there are way too many differences between US and Japan besides ""MBA density"". It could be the case that Japanese companies hold their own <i>despite</i> the lack of MBAs. In fact, I do believe they do well despite the custom of treating fresh undergrads as useless, insisting on an archaic seniority system, etc.",1275634802

This is certainly not a pan-melting exercise.<p>Building self-sustaining habitats in a zero-g, irradiated environment where resupply is extremely infrequent is very different from building Apollo or the Space Shuttle. You could argue that the ISS is a stab at this, but it&#x27;s not self-sustaining at all. Maybe someday, but we haven&#x27;t done it.<p>The construction of a colony on Mars wouldn&#x27;t be a PR or purely scientific exercise, either. If it&#x27;s enabled by having jumpoff points near the Earth and Mars, there will be enormous advances in robotics, because the potential payoff will be huge. The first company to successfully mine asteroids will reap a huge windfall in platinum and other metals that are rare on Earth. These metals becoming cheaper and more abundant will have large effects on the terrestrial economy because suddenly, whole new classes of devices become cost-effective (fuel cells, for example).<p>There will be other advances in science from this, beyond the pedestrian &quot;make existing tech faster&quot; stuff, and it&#x27;s not make-work.

In high school I contributed to open source and did freelance while also taking Comp Sci classes at my local university. I went to college where I majored in CS and Economics. In college I worked on research projects, did an internship for a Fortune 100 company where I worked on flight control software, and I worked for several years in embedded software development. I eventually got involved with the entrepreneurship program, made a startup, dropped out and ran it for a few years (2010-2012). We got to the point where we needed money to scale, but we didn&#x27;t find the terms from the investors here in the Midwest to be amenable. Without the resources to scale or even move the company to a better environment, we eventually closed it down.<p>Most of my personal and professional experience is in systems programming with C/C++, but I also have several years of professional experience with PHP/Python/CSS/JS/HTML. I have academic and personal experience with many other things as well, and I have an extensive portfolio of code to prove my abilities with all of these things.<p>Recently I have applied to several companies and gotten interviews. This includes some large tech firms in the Seattle area. So my main question is, supposing the interviews continue to go well, what sort of offers regarding salary/relocation/hiring bonus should I be expecting?<p>Also, I have no baggage or roadblocks for hiring. I don&#x27;t have a house to sell or anything to tie me down, so I can relocate and be working in short order. I&#x27;m also in talks with several companies. How do I best utilize this leverage?<p>Finally, while I did not finish my college degree, I do have 10 years of programming experience. Should I be concerned about this? What level of developer will I be considered?<p>If you have any other advice or input, please feel free to share it. Thanks!",1371949589

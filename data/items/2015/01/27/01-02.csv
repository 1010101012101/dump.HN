Funnily enough moving from svn git in one project I know of probably did a lot of the necessary work to achieve this, by having to remove reliance on $SVN tags and pre/post-&quot;build commits&quot; which used to be a part of the release process.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting use-case for Docker as well: you can ship the build environment (or its Dockerfile describing it) for people to run builds under the same env as the official released build.",1422323921

8950877,comment,8947354,8950719,0,0,ploxiln,,,"For the applications I&#x27;ve dealt with, it&#x27;s an upside that a workers distributed across a number of servers can process messages from producers distributed across a number of servers, with no user-defined partitioning. Kafka, I think, requires you to define partitions to have multiple workers consume a stream. In the NSQ case, if you need more throughput, just spin it up.<p>Somewhat on a tangent, one of the goals of the design was to avoid any servers in the middle of the &quot;workers&quot; (consumers) and producers, and making it such that any consuming or producing server dieing or experiencing a network partition doesn&#x27;t slow down any producers or consumers who can still reach each other.<p>You&#x27;re right, this isn&#x27;t really focused on replacing map-reduce thing like some other message streaming systems are. For one, I can&#x27;t imagine a &quot;sorting&quot; step using nsq. It&#x27;s still used for somewhat hefty data-processing tasks, in multiple stages. Each stage has as many servers spun up as needed, consuming messages directly from the previous stage, and publishing to nsqd on localhost. They might consume and acknowledge multiple messages to produce one new message.<p>For reduced inter-server hops before hitting the database, you can run workers on the same host as producers. So you might have a X hosts producing messages (and running their own nsqd locally, of course), and have Y consumers on each host, configured to consume messages from localhost instead of using nsqlookupd to find all sources, and those consumers would make direct requests to the appropriate database host. With this setup you can still use nsqadmin to monitor the queue levels on all producer hosts, and you can still be archiving messages to disk on some other remote hosts.",1422323860

The way I&#x27;d think of that if I were translating it to circuitry would be to say that the mammalian brains operate at saturation of a transistor (fully on, or fully off).  And that C. elegans would then be operating in the linear region of the transistor; assuming that you could represent each neuron as a transistor of course.  I wonder if the change in structure happened roughly for the same reason that we&#x27;re changing much of our circuitry from analog to digital (or at least avoiding analog as much as possible) because we can get better noise response and simpler circuit design.  Makes me wonder then if something like epilepsy could be caused by some neurons operating the wrong way and not giving clear signals down the chain which could lead to feedback and/or noise that ends up detrimental.",1422322419

The power companies actively oppose homeowners installing battery backup systems, because they&#x27;re concerned about people charging their batteries using cheap power at night, and then selling that power back to the utility during the day.  In some cases they have refused to approve PV installations with battery backup for this reason.<p>As a homeowner, I would find a system with battery backup to be more attractive than one that&#x27;s useless in a power outage (though, granted, significantly more expensive, depending on capacity).  While I understand the utilities&#x27; concern, I think there has to be a solution.  Doesn&#x27;t it stand to reason that with all this PV coming online, power prices in the middle of the day should drop, even below nighttime prices?  And the prices should be highest on summer evenings?  And that such a pricing pattern would supply the correct incentives to owners of PV systems with battery backup?",1422322367

It can&#x27;t, because &quot;social utility&quot; is visible to the market only through the proxy of willingness to pay. If you assume that the marginal utility of money is roughly proportional to 1/wealth (equivalently, that the utility you get from $X in wealth is roughly proportional to log(X)) then what the economy kinda maximizes is total <i>weighted</i> utility, where every person&#x27;s utility is weighted in proportion to their wealth.<p>What markets give us (in theory, subject to various conditions) is a Pareto-efficient allocation of resources. And there&#x27;s a theorem that says that (in theory, subject to various conditions) one can get any Pareto-efficient allocation of resources by doing a bunch of pure money-transfer operations and then letting the market do its thing.<p>That&#x27;s nice, but it&#x27;s only equivalent to saying that the market maximizes social utility if you regard those money-transfers as net-utility-neutral.<p>So, suppose I have $1M and you have $1K. Under the logarithmic-utility assumption above, an extra $10 for you gains you about as much extra happiness as an extra $10K for me. Consider a transaction in which I find 1000 people like you and pay you each $10 in exchange for what you consider to be $10 worth of inconvenience or pain; I have lost $10K but will be content if I get what I consider to be $10K worth of convenience or pleasure. So we have a possible transaction to which all participants are indifferent: I get a certain amount of happiness; 1000 people each get a roughly equivalent amount of unhappiness; and some money is transferred between us. If money transfers are net-utility-neutral, then by reversing those transfers we get another simpler &quot;utility-neutral&quot; transaction: X units of happiness for me, X units of unhappiness each for 1000 people. So long as they&#x27;re 1000x poorer than me.<p>(Is that logarithmic-utility assumption reasonable? Not entirely. I think it&#x27;s generally held that the marginal utility of wealth decreases <i>faster</i> than that, which would make the factor by which markets weight rich people&#x27;s utility more important than poor people&#x27;s utility <i>greater</i>. On the other hand: If we consider the wealth and utility of corporations as well as individuals, we might want to say that a corporation&#x27;s utility doesn&#x27;t drop off the way an individual&#x27;s does.

But Pareto efficiency means that for anyone to do better, someone would have to do worse. This is not the same as maximizing social utility (while it seems obvious that the point of maximum social utility must be a pareto efficient point, it is not clear that all pareto efficient points maximize social utility.)<p>And, of course, the conditions in which it makes those predictions (both the perfect information part of the rationality condition, and the no-externalities condition) don&#x27;t reflect real world decisions very well.",1422320603

Dynamic typing: Go has duck typing, which gives some of the same benefits. Different refactoring strategies that take advantage of duck typing over other things you&#x27;d do with dynamic languages (like just substituting an object of a different type willy-nilly) will probably make up for the rest. I don&#x27;t see strong support for literal data as a big productivity gain. Go also does a rather good job of treating user defined types like the built-ins and vice-versa, with a few exceptions like maps.<p><i>I didn&#x27;t experience the claims of &quot;Go is just as good as Python for prototyping&quot;, as someone with a fair amount of Python experience.</i><p>A lot of your competence with Python for prototyping probably has to do with your competence with Python.

I do a lot of audio signal processing so I&#x27;m used to dealing with noisy signals at Khz rates. Threshold fluctiations are a fact of life if you&#x27;re trying to do things like pitch detection, envelope following, or sidechain compression (all of which have obvious analogs in the trading context).<p>Obviously you don&#x27;t want to impose too brutal of a low-pass filter on your input because you would miss important signals, but what prevents you from running the input signal to an LPF in parallel and keying a noise gate when the amplitude of the low-frequency (trend) signal drops? This is such a common problem in dealing with audio that we use specific devices called de-essers for recording vocals, because sibilant sounds otherwise tend to throw off other components of the signal chain: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-esser"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-esser</a><p>Ironically, you mention using XKCD-type graphs because &#x27;nobody reads&#x27; the explanations and caveats, but just looks at pictures. I wonder if you aren&#x27;t missing a trick here by over-engineering your HFT systems for speedy response at the inevitable price of positional confusion. Is it possible that you&#x27;re using Infinite Impulse Response filtering and running into denormalization problems as a result? If so, can you not rectify the problem by adding a small amount of noise?<p>I get your point about the negative aspects (for the HFT trader) of quote stuffing, how it can easily lead to being on the wrong side of a trade or punishment by the broker for flooding the output channel with unintended orders. But, you want to make money from automated signal analysis, that&#x27;s your problem in much the same way that a sound engineer is responsible for preventing transient pops and feedback howls in an audio network. Sure, these problematic signal conditions are statistically rare, but when you&#x27;re dealing with a high volume of samples you&#x27;r going to run into statistically rare conditions on a regular basis - and indeed you mention that this is the sort thing you might expect to happen once a day.",1398189320

7629078,comment,7627135,7627555,5,0,AnimalMuppet,,,"This is a standard Lisp idea, but I think it&#x27;s kind of off base.<p>Lisp has this idea of creating a language in which you can solve your problem.  That&#x27;s fine, but the Lisp people mean something rather different than the rest of us do.<p>When I &quot;create a language to solve a problem&quot; in, say, C++, I create some nouns (objects), some verbs (methods), maybe some adjectives (other objects or flags) and adverbs (more flags).  Then I can write my application using that &quot;language&quot;, but using normal C/C++ syntax.<p>When Lisp people say &quot;create a language to solve a problem&quot;, they mean &quot;write completely different syntax&quot;.  The article gives some examples.<p>Why would I want to do that?  Well, I might want to explore a new paradigm - some new thing like aspect oriented programming, say.  I don&#x27;t have to wait for a language that implements it, I can just do it myself.  This is great for academic research projects, but not nearly so great for production code.  (Bringing new people up to speed becomes a much longer process, if your code outlives the original developers.)<p>But I might have to create new language features just to get anything done in Lisp.  One example is LOOP.  It&#x27;s a macro, because Lisp without macros doesn&#x27;t have very good looping ability.  &quot;It&#x27;s a building material&quot; partly in this sense:  <i>It&#x27;s not a very good tool</i>.  It&#x27;s not all that usable until you add the parts that, in most other languages, you already get.<p>Now, does LOOP do more than a C-style for or while loop?  I doubt it, but perhaps it does it more neatly.  But C gives you 90% of what you need without a macro, whereas Lisp gives you 10% without a macro.  If you need more in C, you can do it, even if it&#x27;s a bit clumsy.  But in Lisp without macros, it&#x27;s horribly clumsy all the time.<p>(Yes, I know that there are Lisp and Haskell types who seem to regard writing a for loop over a container as a great waste of programmer time.  I think that they are mistaken.)<p>You can do some amazing things with Lisp macros.  Paul Graham gives the example of writing an extension language for Viaweb that Lisp macros turned into Lisp code, which was then run on the server.  That&#x27;s really slick (though in the current situation, you have to watch out for security issues unless you validate that file <i>very</i> carefully).  But if he had chosen another approach, what would change?  The macros have to turn the file syntax into Lisp syntax.  If he had written an ordinary parser, he would have had to do the same.  The only difference is that, by using macros, he let the Lisp compiler do the grunt work of the parsing.<p>TL;DR:  Lisp <i>needs</i> macros to be usable.  I&#x27;m not convinced that C does.",1398188112

The whole reason referrals are valuable is because they leverage the trust between two people.  I trust that someone I refer is going to put their best foot forward and perform well, the person I refer trusts that I&#x27;m not going to recommend them to a crappy hiring experience or a crappy company.  They also trust that I&#x27;m not going to spam them or otherwise waste their time.<p>By putting all of my contacts in the hands of the HR dept I no longer have any control over how or when the company contacts them.  That company can easily break the trust I have with my contacts.  I wouldn&#x27;t be comfortable doing that, referral bonus or no referral bonus.<p>Then there&#x27;s the section about outsourcing this internal contact mining and impersonating a VP in recruiting emails.  If you&#x27;re starting out the process with outsourcing and fake personal touches chances are you are not going to treat my network with care.<p>The most important question doesn&#x27;t even get asked here, does an employee <i>want</i> to refer his or her network to the company.  Some people are just not going to feel comfortable with doing that at all, or maybe they don&#x27;t trust the company enough yet.  Being aggressive with someone that feels that way could elicit quite a negative reaction.<p>I do think working the networks of employees could bear great referrals but I think a delicate and thoughtful touch needs to be applied.",1398187809

In that study, based on data for the year 2000, France was also ranked No. 1, with the lowest rate of avoidable deaths. The United States was last, in 19th place, with the highest rate of avoidable deaths.

Worst case if you can&#x27;t guess, you can ask him which one he means, &quot;the writing XYZ (pen) or the shop XYZ (sign)?&quot; I definitely enjoy when the kanji in written form rules out synonyms for me, even if I can&#x27;t see kanji in speech.<p>The usual pro-kanji argument, which I do believe holds up a bit, is that it makes reading a lot faster, and allows you to condense a lot more text into the same visual area. Great for old video games and comics, at least. The downside to me as a learner is that I find myself saying the kanji in their English meaning because I don&#x27;t remember the proper pronunciation, but know what that kanji by itself means.<p>But yeah, it would certainly be a lot more approachable to have the languages written in pinyin or hiragana+katakana, so long as they used spaces between words (and sadly, written Japanese without kanji do not.) And technically, with digital works, you can certainly transform text like that. There are some nice Firefox plugins where you can hover over Chinese characters to see their readings.<p>> That poem was written specifically for a political battle<p>Oh, that&#x27;s unfortunate.

It encourages decoupling you from your dependencies.<p>- the code has one correct formatting convention and a tool that will auto-format your code<p>- many complex rules for numeric conversions that are implicit in C and cause no end of trouble are explicit and much simpler in Go.<p>- treating concurrency as a series of sequential process connected with channels makes it MUCH easier to reason about.",1398187070

Zidisha has room for improvement in many respects, but we&#x27;ve always considered transparency to be a strong point of our platform.<p>We have more detailed statistics on repayment rates, trends in repayment performance over time, and risk levels in currently outstanding loans than any other microlending website I know. For example, Kiva, Kiva Zip, United Prosperity, and other well-known microlending websites do not even publish Portfolio At Risk statistics.<p>Since Zidisha is a direct P2P model, our repayment rate is not inflated by &quot;phantom payments&quot; reported by local intermediary partners.

Here are some excerpts from our website:<p>&quot;Zidisha is a low-cost nonprofit community managed by volunteers. Our purpose is to connect individuals in marginalized countries with the chance to improve their lives through affordable loans.

No. Zidisha is a platform for philanthropy, not a replacement for traditional savings accounts or financial investments. Zidisha loans are highly risky, and direct person-to-person lending across international borders is such a new endeavor that expected losses cannot be predicted with sufficient accuracy to make Zidisha loans a safe way to store funds you cannot afford to lose. We recommend that you treat Zidisha loans simply as a way to help others, and that you lend no more than you would normally be prepared to give away to charity.&quot; (Lender FAQ number one, <a href=""https://www.zidisha.org/microfinance/faq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.zidisha.org/microfinance/faq.html</a>)<p>&quot;The principal purpose of Zidisha&#x27;s lenders in funding loans is to improve the lives of these entrepreneurs, and not to make a profitable financial investment. Lending to entrepreneurs through Zidisha involves a meaningful risk of loss of your principal lent. In addition, you are very likely to lose money in real terms on any loan you fund, even if it is repaid by the borrower, as a result of currency exchange rate changes, PayPal fees applied to uploading credit to your lender account, inflation and other factors affecting the value of principal and interest payments made by a borrower. Accordingly, we recommend that you consider lending through Zidisha to be a philanthropic activity, and you should not lend more money through Zidisha than you are prepared to lose.&quot; (Terms of Use, <a href=""https://www.zidisha.org/index.php?p=5"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.zidisha.org/index.php?p=5</a>)<p>More generally, our website code is open source (<a href=""https://github.com/Zidisha/zidisha"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Zidisha/zidisha</a>), and conversations among our volunteer staff take place in public in Zidisha&#x27;s forum.

I think this was the most interesting part of the interview:<p>Q: This is a very versatile lens - a bright, constant aperture, lots of zoom, and 13 elements, which is relatively few for a design like this. How are you able to create something like this?<p>A: We designed it in-house and worked with a Japanese partner to build it ... This plays directly into one of the cooler parts of light field, which is this ability to use the additional data that we capture to get breakthrough hardware performances. There’s no lens on the market that’s equivalent to this.<p>The reason is that, in the conventional sense, you would’t be able to deal with the aberration correction you’d need across that long a zoom and that wide an aperture. The typical way you’d deal with aberration correction is with glass elements - traditional optics. Since we capture all of the directional data within the light field, we’re able to do aberration correction in software and computation. It’s the first big example of us trading out physical components of the camera and replacing those with software and computation to give the market something you just couldn’t do conventionally.",1398186687

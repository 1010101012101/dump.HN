No one has &quot;control&quot; over the Internet.<p>I also don&#x27;t like this, &quot;us vs. them&quot; rhetoric that this story has turned some people towards, where the NSA are the unequivocal bad guys and we, the &quot;little people&quot;, are the unequivocal good guys.  That&#x27;s a great way to get absolutely nothing done.  The NSA is, despite everything we&#x27;re being told by some people (Bruce), on our side.  It&#x27;s paranoid delusion to think the NSA is actively out to get us - at least ostensibly, the NSA is trying to help the citizens of the US.<p>What we should be doing is asking for changes and modifications to how things are done.  There are some not-so-big tweaks to the currently running programs which can feasibly be made without compromising these program&#x27;s efficacy while also providing more insight into what&#x27;s going on.  We can have our cake (terrorist monitoring) and eat it too (maintain individual privacy) - it&#x27;s possible.<p><i>That&#x27;s</i> what we should be figuring out, not this chicken little/us vs. them bullshit.",1376323192

It works exactly like it does in any other lightweight thread implementation AFAIK, except that in languages such as Erlang or Haskell, these continuations are created by the compiler or by the runtime, while in Quasar they&#x27;re created with bytecode transformation.

Yes, there was only a tiny mention in the post, but it was there.<p>I think that what and how comments are useless because they&#x27;re literally the code itself. Comments like &#x27;increment by two&#x27; are useless, because the next line literally says `x += 2`.<p>If that comment was expanded to be something like &#x27;increment by two because ...&#x27;, explaining why x is being incremented by two, it becomes useful, and I think the author agrees.<p>I think the reason these posts get as much traction as they do every time they&#x27;re posted is because people tend to write bad comments. In my experience as a CS tutor at my college, most new programmers either write useless what/how comments or no comments at all.<p>The problem I see with these posts are that they don&#x27;t talk about how there are good kinds of comments, but that everyone should just make their code cleaner and everything will be great.

Larger companies might find it more difficult to get around the mindset that meetings are universally important and everyone eventually wants to be a manager.

Comments are frequently inane explaining the obvious, while documentation goes in-depth into not only how the code works, but what it is trying to accomplish and why. Documentation also provides examples of use, which is far more useful than anything else. When I reach for the documentation option, I almost always include a separate markdown file with the same name as the original file.

LazyAnalytic has been my side project for a couple months. It&#x27;s a tool that takes raw events from apps and turn them into a beautiful and meaningful feed.<p>The goal is to make it easy to explore what is happening on your app. I.e. Spot trends, find out which features users really like (or never use). A huge emphasis was to make the app intuitive for non-technical users so that they can explore the data without being overwhelmed by hundreds of graphs or being forced to disturb developers to do DB queries.<p>How is it different then Google Analytic or Mixpanel? Both of these tools are very good to answer specific questions. But it&#x27;s hard to explore the events without easily getting overwhelmed by all the data. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love GA and Mixpanel and I still use them on all my projects. But I still prefer lazyanalytic for exploring and discovering users&#x27; behavior. I like how I can see the big picture but dig into what seems intriguing in one click.<p>So far, I&#x27;ve got a MVP built for my projects and my friends projects. I&#x27;m working on the general framework to make it easy to integrate for any apps or websites. Still, if you&#x27;d like to try it out on your startup/project, make sure your register and I&#x27;ll contact you. (Maybe add +HN in your email address or name).<p>Thanks!",1376321542

It is, in fact, a <i>natural consequence</i> that even good people will do &#x27;bad things&#x27; when put in the position.<p>Imagine the following:  You, mtgx, are put in charge of protecting the mid-Atlantic states from an attack.  You have been given complete access to all of the legally obtained intelligence that the nation has about the region and potential conspirators for said attack.<p>Do you <i>not</i> use it?   What are your options?  If you don&#x27;t use it, and the attacks are successful, it will be your fault.  You will have to live with the knowledge that your inaction, for whatever higher purpose, cost those lives.<p>I posit that even good people like you would take all of the steps you have available to do your job.  Even if by day you are writing letters to the editors begging the nation to take those powers away from you.<p>For a reak example, look no farther than what happened in the case of the Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev.  It turns out that we had a lot of intelligence on him; the Russians even alerted us that he was trouble.  And yet, we did not feel we had enough evidence to invade his privacy.  We didn&#x27;t stop him (this is why I think that the people doing this are basically trying to do the right thing).  And when we found out after the bombing that this could have been stopped?  The shit hit the fan:  People were declaring the FBI/CIA incompetent, etc.<p>The main reason to act on this privacy issue is to help the good people who have to do these jobs, not to stop evil people.  The rules are now such that good people have to do evil things in order to be good.<p>We want to keep this in mind so that we solve the right problem.",1376319722

The thing that isn&#x27;t reported here is that they announced the same thing in early 2012 -- though it is the first time they&#x27;ve explicitly mentioned sale, and they now have one specific bank representing them.<p>Also of possible interest is Prem Watsa&#x27;s withdrawal from the board due to conflict of interest - this may hint at Fairfax&#x27;s direct involvement in sale or other negotations around taking the company private.<p>In any case, I hope it works out well.  With the QNX-based BB10 OS they&#x27;ve caught up to and in some ways surpassed the competition, particularly with recent and upcoming updates.<p>The problem they face is three-fold: the competition is now too firmly entrenched, making it extremely difficult to get consumer and developer mindshare.<p>This is compounded by (and in large part caused by) the fact that they waited so long - their legacy BB OS has rendered them largely irrelevant to most people, and that&#x27;s a huge hurdle to overcome.<p>Finally, there is a lot of carrier antipathy in the US market.   Carriers are doing virtually no supportive marketing, and updates that have rolled out internationally in July won&#x27;t be out in the US until late September.<p>Competition is heating up in the low-margin areas outside of the US that have typically bolstered their sales.<p>Their future is looking pretty uncertain (and I say this as someone who develops BB apps) - a manufacturing or licensing deal could provide them with what they need to keep going.",1376319614

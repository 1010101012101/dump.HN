In an ideal scenario this could lead to realization that their opinions, views, and in the end reality, are not as black and white as they think - i.e. a Steven Colbert effect.",1339513153

Requiring two distinct devices does help (especially if one is stolen but not the other), but over time, people will move to mobile-only with some kind of cloud syncing, so it will make less sense.<p>The ideal is still something built into a mobile OS with hardware protection (e.g. iOS Keystore), storing either random long string passwords or some kind of public key credential, and either a trustable network proxy converting that to standard username/password to log into sites, or sites adopting this as a means of authentication (client cert auth sucked a lot in the past, true, but it doesn't have to suck).<p>Then, all your identity/presence (biometric, geofencing, heuristics, ...), backup, key recovery, etc. could be handled in one place, by one API.<p>That's what I was hoping Apple would do with Passbook/iOS6/iCloud, but doesn't appear to be anything they care about.  Only Apple could build this (due to how the platform works, you can't override things), since every app would need to use the API, and web browsing (via Safari) would be 90% of the use.  Unfortunately Android has no platform security (and anything would be 2-3 years away, once MTM is available), BB is dead, BB10 is stillborn, and WP doesn't seem to care.",1339512745

I don't care that apps can add functionality to the operating system. If it isn't there by default, it doesn't count as a feature.

4100694,comment,4100032,4100535,3,0,CharlieA,,,"I take your point, in part, and I don't necessarily disagree with you, because by and large the system does work. But (to use your analogy) when it comes to the law-making branch of government we have this massive sprawling ""codebase"" and it doesn't necessarily need a lot of new code (laws) putting in place, but rather, there's a lot of cruft and old legacy stuff that maybe needs to be removed or updated, and the time it takes to get things done is just incredibly slow, which can lead to a lot of frustration for a lot of people. While on the whole that may not actually be such a bad thing, as you rightly point out (""...law needs broad consensus and relatively few are passed..."") it strikes me that the attitudes of many people (even myself, on occasion) are strikingly similar to the OP's in the excerpt I highlighted wherein due to a perceived inefficiency of government (rightly or wrongly) we may come to the conclusion that the best course of action is to abandon the democratic process in favor of something which addresses these inefficiencies...which in itself leads to...well...that's the scary part... I suppose. In a game of Civilization it's not a big deal. In reality...<p>My only real problem with the representative system of democracy generally, is the way we have to proxy our voting authority through our political leaders. It just seems archaic and ludicrous for a region of people (sometimes many hundreds of thousands of people) to have to boil down their political ideologies to a single ""best fit"" candidate. Even ignoring the potential for corruption, personal motivations, hidden biases etc. you've simplified thousands of separate beliefs on an equal number of issues, social, economic, all, into ONE PERSONS' beliefs and worst of all...that person then has a legitimate claim to believe that they're representing the people.<p>I suppose it's the difference between a politician believing that they're a ""representation"" of the people of the electorate, OR a ""representative"" of those voters.

so either someone is in looking over your shoulder (which a lot of people would like to be doing when you're a target)... and can remote control/ do stuff in your name (perhaps when you're not using the computer), keylog and basically do anything you can do or have been doing....<p><i>or</i> nobody is in yet.  (Except as general malware that doesn't know who you are, nobody is remote controlling/keylogging you and checking those files.)<p>This is MOST of the cases - how do you even know which of millions of computers out there that are 'mostly secure' except against a targeted attack with a lot of known information about the laptop target, is the one that belongs to this millionaire VC?  They'd have to look through millions of computers to find him or her...<p>I'm not talking about a botnet you're part of that has millions of users.  I'm talking about someone targeting you.<p>So, it's basically vulnerability exposure is a STEP function, with a function that goes from ""no remote keylogging; even though I'm important no one knows my computer's mac address or what software it's running"" at x = 0 to whatever, with a corresponding horizontal y value of ""low level of exposure"", to, at the next step, ""a keylogger is installed on my computer"" having a HUGE jump in exposure rating to ""totally fucked since now they have my every credit card, can see my every email, etc etc etc.  They can just watch over my network and whenever I make a purchase, also make themselves a purchase.""<p>Since Google services can be accessed via https, between those two steps, aren't you ""safe as long as no one is getting into your computer since they don't even know this computer belongs to a strong target?""<p>But with the second factor, you're adding a step there between that stepwise leap:<p>-> Someone's figured out my phone number; now if they can hack my voice mail they can get Google to send a reset code to it, get the reset code, and take over my account.<p>The point is: WITHOUT breaching the original second step (i.e. even finding out what physical mac address or, at a given time, IP address, belongs to 'you', or what hardware and software you're even running.)<p>Your email address and phone number you use, meanwhile is in some sense 'totally public' as that is where you're MEANT to be reached.  Both of those things are things that you give out willy-nilly, unlike any information about which computer in America is yours.<p>So it seems to me that not introducing an insecurity step between step 0 and step 1 would be a good solution: use a secure password, don't write it down anywhere, and use it from computers which aren't especially linked to you or particularly 'tainted'.<p>why make yourself a target with hackable 2-factor authentication?<p><i>TL;DR: your phone number is supposed to be public, your email is supposed to be public, the phone company is not a security token.

Over the last two centuries, technological advantages have allowed some traders to be faster than others. We argue that, contrary to popular perception, speed is not the defining characteristic that sets High Frequency Trading (HFT) apart. HFT is the natural evolution of a new trading paradigm that is characterized by strategic decisions made in a volume-clock metric. Even if the speed advantage disappears, HFT will evolve to continue exploiting Low Frequency Tradings (LFT) structural weaknesses. However, LFT practitioners are not defenseless against HFT players, and we offer options that can help them survive and adapt to this new environment.",1339509929

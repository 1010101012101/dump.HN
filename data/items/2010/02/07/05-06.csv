1107328,comment,1106677,1106677,0,0,anactofgod,,,"Let's be clear about one thing: all businesses, even startups, are supposed to generate <i>profits</i>. That competition already exists.<p>So, on it's face, this is a terrible idea. But not hopeless. Maybe it can be turned into a serviceable one if we turn the premise on it's head. Let's instead consider the question: What business activity <i>would</i> benefit from an intense competition conducted over a short duration?<p>Of the top of my head, what comes to mind is something like a product/service launch marketing campaign. Or perhaps something that has a defined expiration date, like event promotion.<p>Hmm... the way it could work is that the company whose business it is to adjudicate would solicit Customers requiring the marketing/promotion services. A Customer would be able to specify the rules, duration, judgement criteria and awards. Then the Adjudicator would open the solicitation to the public, and manage the resulting competition on behalf of the Customer.<p>Marketing/PR/promo companies would come to the Adjudicator's site to view the various Customers solicitations. They can then choose to respond to a solicitation as a Competitor.<p>That's kind of interesting, at least to me. Similar to another startup I worked on a few years back. So, what would the entrepreneurs setting up the Adjudicator need to do? Setting up a site to enable Customers to enter the actual competition criteria is trivial. There would be two big challenges.<p>One relates to verifying results. How would one accurately measure the key criteria of the competitions as specified by the Customer (eyeball views/tickets sold/etc), and corresponds them to the correct Competitor? Tricky, but solvable. I have some notions about that. You can probably think of a few ways.<p>The second has to do with creating lightweight, but binding, legal frameworks to protect the Customers', Competitors', and Adjudicator's interests. Non-trivial, but also solvable.<p>So, not necessarily a great idea, but definitely better than the original premise.<p>Thoughts? Ways to improve this idea? Or create a competition out of some other outsource-able business activity that customers would pay for?",1265521827

1107322,comment,1106616,1106616,0,0,rglovejoy,,,"I have AS and I know from experience that it is not something that can be ""cured"".  The thing to do is recognize that dealing with people and social situations is not something that is instinctual, but must be learned.  This is probably why you feel more outgoing and social: you have had to work at it and eventually you became proficient.<p>For me, I can get along with people perfectly well, but it does take a lot of mental energy to do so, and I still have to form sentences in my head before I can say them; it does not happen automatically.  I also have to pay close attention to body language and voice inflections, in order to know what people are really trying to say.<p>I would venture to say that there is no such thing as a cure for AS or other forms of Autism.  It has more to do with how the brain is wired than it does with inner beings being trapped inside a metaphorical cage.  You are doing the right thing by engaging with other people and learning how to deal with them.  But you should also know that AS can be a strength too.",1265521317

1107308,comment,1106982,1107076,0,0,DougWebb,,,"That's because Engineering isn't Art. It's not Craftsmanship either. If you're really practicing Engineering, then you're using a lot of math and a lot of well-understood design principles to design whatever it is you're creating before you create it. You're able to prove, based solely on the design, that when you get around to actually building it the thing is going to meet all applicable requirements. The PE signs off on that design as a guarantee that it's going to be good. And /then/ you build it.<p>Artists and Craftsmen just forge ahead into creating with little more than a general idea of what they're making. The design evolves as they go. Programming is almost always like this, because it's just too damn hard, time-consuming, and expensive to document the design in sufficient detail ahead of time. No requirements documentation is as detailed as the final source code, when it comes to describing precisely how the software must behave.<p>That, I think, is why software development will always be Art or Craftsmanship rather than a true Engineering discipline. If you're designing a bridge, it's much cheaper and faster to design it on paper than with steel, because paper drawings and specifications are able to capture all of the details that matter. If designing a bridge required specifying the exact position of every iron atom, no one would bother trying to do it on paper first. With software, there is no advantage to doing more than a high level design on paper first because every byte in the source code is significant. You get one wrong, and the software doesn't work. You can't capture that in the design without actually writing the source code, so we skip that level of design. We're craftsmen instead, designing as we go.",1265520467

1107300,comment,1107090,1107090,0,0,dangrossman,,,"So very true. 3DS is technologically horrible. In exchange for protection from certain types of chargebacks, a merchant is expected to iframe a 1995-looking webpage from Visa or MasterCard asking the cardholder to create or enter a password. It's abrupt and unexpected, does not fit into the checkout process of any website, and because it's framed the customer has no idea what site they're really giving their password to. All this adds up to lowering conversion rates and undermining all the anti-phishing efforts the banks undertake by telling you to never give out a banking password without checking the address bar.<p>The paper recalls a perfect example from one of its authors -- the official 3DS page is served by securesuite.co.uk for some UK banks, so he calls his bank and they tell him it's a phishing scam. Yet merchants are expected to do this, lest their chargeback rate climb too high and the account be terminated.<p>I've only encountered 3DS in the wild once, and only after registering a card for it in the process of testing my own implementation. It only took two days of running VBV and MSc on one of my websites to see that it would be completely economically infeasible -- doesn't matter if I'm protected from chargebacks if it means half my customers abandon checkout out of fear and confusion.<p>I've had a real hard time handling card-not-present fraud on my websites. I sell packaged self-service advertising services on one site, and it's highly targeted by the do-no-goods that want to use it to push traffic to affiliate sites and phishing scams. They use stolen credit cards to buy the advertising hoping to funnel good money, or more stolen cards, from the traffic back to their accounts. I still have one merchant account in limbo (bank holding 6 months worth of payments) from spending two years working on fraud detection methods to battle this. I only got chargebacks below 1% through geolocation, country blocklists, proxy detection, my own and 3rd party blacklists, minfraud risk scoring, in-house risk scoring and pattern matching against past fraud, and phone verification of all high risk orders.",1265519878

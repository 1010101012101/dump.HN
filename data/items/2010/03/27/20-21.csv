1223654,comment,1223440,1223440,0,0,aaronblohowiak,,,"NodeJS is awesome.  I love it.  However, it is not a web framework.  NodeJS is more like Rack than Rails.  There is no default persistence engine, no template rendering and no concept of a controller.  There is not even a router!   These things are not ""core"" to writing server-side javascript. NodeJS also speaks more than http!  You can do raw TCP or UDP if you please.<p>You <i>can</i> build web frameworks on top of NodeJS (and lots of people are,) but that's kind of boring to me.  NodeJS is particularly good at handling lots of open connections that it can read from and write to whenever it gets around to it.      This means writing chat servers is trivial, writing a ""socket server"" for a game is trivial, push notification for websites is easy, and on and on.<p>Because of how little it does, it is a lot easier to get my head around than any of the other big evented frameworks (twisted, eventmachine &etc.)",1269723342
1223653,comment,1222956,1223517,0,0,Maktab,,,"<i>>Yes, when British colonization was happening Britain had outgrown that stage, but perhaps they were able to outgrow it because they were allowed to develop independently as a people? I'm not sure justifying colonization because of people like Shaka is valid. Colonization might have slowed down Africa's growth out of the tribal stage</i><p>Although the Britons weren't exactly allowed to develop independently. They were alternatively conquered by many stronger cultures, starting with the Romans and continuing through to the Anglo-Saxons, the Vikings and eventually the Normans. As far as cultural shifts go, that's quite a bit more extreme than that experienced by colonies during 19th and 20th century European colonialism, with British cultures being not only shocked by exposure to outside forces but in some cases completely obliterated. But they turned out ok. Strong cultures have been invading weak cultures for nearly all of human history, it has traditionally been one way for cultural innovations to spread.<p>If a culture is strong enough to be able to so comprehensively conquer another, it's obviously doing something right. I've often thought that the optimal strategy for a conquered territory in that sort of scenario might be to assimilate their victor's culture as far as possible, gradually take over the reigns of power and build up strength locally so as to eventually present the reigning power with a fait accompli. See for how example how the Boers (called Afrikaners later) in South Africa went from being mostly ill-educated and rural farmers who badly lost a war with Britain in 1902 to running most of the government when the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910 and being dominant enough to declare the creation of an independent republic by 1961 without significant opposition and no bloodshed. Ignoring apartheid and all the rest, that has always struck me as a particularly smart way to go about achieving independence. Whether the same approach would have applied in all situations is an open question, but it must surely have been better than overthrowing an external authority without any kind of viable replacement ready for it.",1269723303

Whether or not it's GoF, Fowler or any other source doesn't change that it's a design pattern, though. GoF patterns are no different from Fowler's EAA patterns. One is not meant for static languages while the other is meant for dynamic. That's not how patterns work. If you think that GoF patterns were specifically made for Java, you should look at the publishing date of the book. You might also consider that the book uses Smalltalk in its examples. PS. Smalltalk is dynamic.<p>The problem with your argument is that the ""triviality"" of their implementation has nothing to do with whether or not you use them.<p><pre><code>    class X < DelegateClass(String); end\n</code></pre>\nThis is using the delegate pattern. It's pretty damn trivial to implement. But we <i>are</i> using the delegate pattern. This is a fact. We can do the same for singletons, factories, facades, visitors and strategies. How you implement them does not define whether or not you use them. Whether or not you <i>tell</i> people you use them is what matters, because patterns are about communication, not implementation. If you don't understand this simple concept then you're completely missing the point of design patterns.<p>Yes, you can implement the Adapter pattern in Ruby without doing anything explicit-- that doesn't mean you didn't use the Adapter pattern. This is where denial kicks in. If you say ""I don't use strategy patterns, I use DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING!"" you're seriously deluding yourself.",1269722980

1223629,comment,1222956,1223497,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Well, I just spent about an hour reading up on the history of India, and you're right on a lot of counts. Let me ask, since you seem quite knowledgeable - do you think the British meant well in India, or not? It's fashionable these days to bash colonialism, but my understanding is that the British generally tried to do right by the people they governed. (With some exceptions - Oliver Cromwell, for instance)<p>Take education:<p>Wikipedia:<p>""Between 1867 and 1941 the British increased the percentage of the population in Primary and Secondary Education from around 0.6% of the population in 1867 to over 3.5% of the population in 1941. However this was much lower than the equivalent figures for Europe where in 1911 between 8 and 18% of the population were in Primary and Secondary education.[18] Additionally literacy was also improved. In 1901 the literacy rate in India was only about 5% though by Independence it was nearly 20%.[19]""<p>So things improved, but slower than Europe. India also de-industrialized through British rule, but then, the Industrial Revolution in England absolutely wrecked all pre-Industrial workforces everywhere, not just India.<p>It looks to me like there was an initial surge of chaos after the British pulling out, but that can be explained by inadequate police, safety, and emergency response personnel which the Indian government did try to remedy quickly.<p>Nehruvian Socialism looks like it was a disaster - per capita GDP looks like it shrunk from 1950 to 1995:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Per_capita_GDP_of_South_Asian_economies_%26_SKorea_(1950-1995).png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Per_capita_GDP_of_South_As...</a><p>But I'd just chalk that up to socialism, no? Socialism historically has slow rates of growth, more poverty, quality of life lagging.<p>Since the free market liberalization, India's growth rates have been crazy fast. From '99 to '07 the lowest per capita GDP growth rate was 7%, the average somewhere around 12%. Which is fantastic.<p>Beyond that - what's your take if you have a free minute? I don't want to be ignorant on global affairs and you're obviously quite studied in Indian history. What's your take on the British, the socialism afterwards, and the liberalization? My previous thinking was that the British were trying, but upon reflection the improvements they made did lag the rest of the world. Mixed socialism was probably the worst thing India could've jumped into after that (me: not a fan of socialism at all...) but the liberalization in the 90's was really good.<p>But what's your take, and can you recommend anything to read? I try to overcome my ignorance when it's there.<p>And yeah - I'll wind up in India for some reason sooner or later, and I'll look you up. I'd say do likewise if you're in the same place as me, but I'm not sure where that's going to be! I'm in Kowloon, Hong Kong if you're here in the next week or two, most likely Beijing after that. I'll do some more reading on Akbar - I'm familiar with the name but haven't spent so much time checking him out. Thanks for the recommendation, and thanks for the discussion.",1269722721

Perhaps the CRM portion of AdWords (i.e., where the advertisers submit their ads and publishers view their balances) is -- it's fairly easy to partition by functionality and doesn't have extremely tight latency bounds. This isn't where real time auctions (what really distinguishes AdWords from what came before) happen.<p>You can be <i>sure</i>, however that the data used for real time ad auctions is extracted out of MySQL and into a <i>highly</i> customized data store (likely, a pure in memory one). It's all about using a right tool for the job. You can also be sure that you'll never see a paper on that data store, as that's their competitive edge. If you could duplicate it with off the shelf components (whether MySQL <i>or</i> Cassandra), Google would be toast.<p>Likewise, I am sure Amazon uses Oracle for their billing system and catalog submission interface, but they use specialized systems for search, shopping cart and recommendations.<p>For a business app that only needs to scale to the amount of <i>paying</i> customers (i.e., advertisers, account managers and customer support) and has no real time constraints -- but on the other hand involves complex and frequently changing business logic (e.g., where altering tables may be required) an RDBMS is the right tool for the job.<p>Where latency matters, data grows much faster than Moore's law (in relational to main memory size), Amdahl's law starts to matter in regards to computation (computation work load needs to be partitioned to take advantage of parallelism), and traditional caching strategies simply don't work, something else is. That situation is starting to become more and more common across web companies. You can also be sure that places like Wallmart and the like employ plenty of non-relational technologies (my personal bet would be is that they're likely using Coherence or Terracotta): usually, however, they're expensive and are built/configured by field-engineers to be custom tailored for their workloads. When you employ a world-class engineering team, ""build"" starts to make more sense than buy when you're solving a very specific and constrained problem (e.g., fault tolerant shopping cart system).<p>You don't need to be of Google's size to be at that stage. Talking about scalability and performance without taking the workloads into account (e.g., ""Google Facebook or Amazon"" as if e-commerce, search and social networking were compatible) is also an anti-pattern: I am sure engineers at Google would laugh when you compare Facebook's scale to theirs; likewise Facebook's engineers would laugh when you compare the real time aggregation that happens on their site to what happens at Amazon; Amazon's engineers would likely tell you holiday season pager duty horror stories that would scare Facebook <i>or</i> Google engineers.",1269722183

At any rate, one of the features is obviously, playback. Now keeping all of those physics updates in an SQL is pointless.

1223590,comment,1222956,1223155,0,0,Maktab,,,"Thing is, what you describe (""Merely installing a peacekeeping force, and then concentrating on the reconstruction of those countries -- the building of schools and hospitals, and other infrastructure"") is precisely what did happen in the DR Congo and Sudan. In both cases the United Nations and African Union deployed a large peacekeeping force of approximately 16 000 troops in each country, armed in some cases with AFVs and attack helicopters, and backed them up with a significant civil assistance and reconstruction program. All this was funded largely by the US and EU, the UN's primary donors.<p>In neither case was the peacekeeping mission itself particularly successful. MONUC in the DRC stood impressive but ineffectual for over a decade as the violence continued raging around them and civilians continued dying and being terrorised. The violence has arguably died down only because President Kabila has proven to be fairly tenacious and the government army has managed to restore some level control in certain areas, thanks in part to training by Belgian and South African military advisors. UNAMID in Sudan did not seem to achieve much, though their reporting was valuable, with much of the progress in that country seemingly being due to the ongoing strengthening of the South Sudanese rebel movements and the severe international pressure that worked for once. In retrospect, we may be able to claim that both missions were ultimately successful, but it's clear that if it's a rapid end to violence and an improvement in basic human security you want then look elsewhere.<p>These conflicts are usually just too much of an intractable problem for peacekeeping to be of any real effect. For one, peacekeeping by its very nature tends to preserve the status quo, by slowing the conflict down and preventing either side from gaining a swift advantage, but this is what allows these conflicts to drag on for decades without any real winner. For another, peacekeeping forces are seldom capable of performing offensive missions to wipe out rebel forces and their leaders or groups of bandits, not only because they're not funded for it but because that would require deciding from the outset who to support and who to destroy and the UN, in order not to adversely effect possible negotiations, usually tries to avoid that. After all, what if you make the wrong choice? Finally, how do you build a state up without any kind of central authority around which to hang the authority, monopoly of force and institutions needed to ensure human security? This by the way was a large part of the problem in Iraq, where the US had to create a central authority from scratch and found it to be a whole lot harder than initially thought.<p>If you are willing to make a snap judgement about who is 'good or bad' in a conflict though, there are solutions that will result in short-term stabilisation. One of these is the use of mercenaries, who have proven in the past (see Executive Outcomes in Sierra Leone and their proposed intervention plan for Rwanda) to be effective in this sort of scenario. However, the use of mercenaries is undoubtedly subject to abuses and it's a short-term solution in most cases, as the core civil and social dysfunction that permitted the breakdown in order in the first place remains present. However, they also only work best in cases where they're able to piggy-back off some sort of central authority and where they have a clear mandate and a clear distinction of who the good and bad guys are. And when they leave, as when Executive Outcomes left Sierra Leone to be replaced by a UN peacekeeping force, the violence can start up all over again.<p>In the end I think the sad fact of the matter is that this is not a simple problem to solve, despite surface impressions. Conflict, crime, poverty and sexual abuse in many African countries is all part of the same issue, of states and civil institutions that are either totally dysfunctional or entirely non-existent, a concurrent tendency for regions to produce warlords rather than self-sufficient federalist enclaves and the immense difficulty both the people living in the country and those from outside face in trying to build a viable and secure system of governance in a place that has little or nothing on which to build. So unfortunately, I think we're going to be living with this problem for a long time to come.",1269721566

Part of the shrapnel of this decision is that rails did away with triggers, db constrains and stored procedures but this is simply because most high volume sites don't use these things anyways because they get very hard to scale later on.<p>Rails past 3.0 will work natively with any data store that you can imagine. It ships something called ActiveModel which is a tiny interface that you can implement on top of Mongo, Cassanda, Redis. ActiveRecord is just the SQL incarnation of this interface.<p>Very high quality libraries based on ActiveModel already exist. Have a look at Cassandra Object as an example.",1269720550

But I've seen you post about hiring, saying that you are looking for smart people, and have specified Rails.  OK, so if I contacted you about a job and had solid Rails skills, what else would you want me to be knowledgeable about, even if not directly related to what you do, that would convince you that I'm the sort of hacker you'd give a second look?<p>I'm honestly curious, not fishing for a job.

Arminius had the heads of his victims nailed to trees: it provided a telling psychological message that was not lost on Rome. Violence became its own reward. The empire retreated behind the Rhine and, except for occasional forays, left Germany alone."" Among other fun things, the Cherusci (the ""barbarian"" group that carried out the attack) were known for nailing defeated-but-living enemies to the trunks of ""sacred oak trees"".",1269720510

I must have missed that part in Design Patterns that said ""if you use Ruby you should not use this book"".<p>But hey, I guess the Ruby stdlib includes the ""Singleton"" pattern for fun right? Not because you'd use it, or anything. Same with delegates. And I guess Rails didn't actually implement Martin Fowler's Active Record, Action Controller and MVC patterns? You just dreamed those.<p>Wake up. Your comment is painful and a little embarrassing. Design patterns are language independent. They are not implementation, they are descriptions. They can be used in any language, and they are used in Ruby.",1269720356

8481205,comment,8480551,8481065,0,0,tomp,,,"The problem with this idea, at least compared with current implementations of Haskell and OCaml, is that it requires runtime type information. Right now, Haskell and OCaml both perform erasure, and the only kind of runtime type information used is for the GC, but if you have two ADTs with identical structure (number of branches, payloads) but different names (i.e. they are different types), they will be encoded in the same way. So, in order to tell them apart, you would need some additional type information, which would require changes to compilers and would probably performance characteristics.",1413795561

The Solaris kit was easy to keep running once you&#x27;d got over the initial configuration hell and was very stable. The Linux stuff however was nasty at best. From CIFS/SMB crashes taking out the VFS layer to drivers packing in to incorrect documentation to random hangups. That is across CentOS and Debian. They are not even remotely stable IMHO. Debian is far better than CentOS was but that still pales in comparison to even, dare I say it, Windows Server 2008.<p>As a sideline, I&#x27;d been using OpenBSD on a couple of test machines because it was interesting and I encountered entirely the opposite of the above. I threw it into production instead of a CentOS 5 box that we were retiring as a postfix/dovecot SMTP/IMAP box. The throughput is about 10-15%[1] less but my word the thing is a million times easier to administer and is absolutely bomb proof. Every configuration option, tool etc is entirely and perfectly documented. It is nothing but bliss. It just keeps ticking. We now have 3 hosts on it. The only missing bit is a decent OpenJDK port but the software guys are starting to use Python for a lot of stuff so that may be moot shortly anyway.<p>My metric for an operating system&#x27;s reliability is if it goes wrong, how much crap do I have to deal with? Well I&#x27;m confident that if an OpenBSD host went down that I could have it back up, even if the internet connection was out and all I had was an OpenBSD CD. I can&#x27;t say the same about anything else these days. Last time I lose an md raid on Linux, it took me a day to get it back due to nothing but crappy documentation and bugs even those it was a tested recovery strategy.<p>[1] The thing is a hefty HP Xeon box so this is background noise compared to the actual load.",1413793802

He is apparently chosen by the government, but the qualities he is required to display are not those of leadership but those of finely judged outrage. For this reason the President is always a controversial choice, always an infuriating but fascinating character. His job is not to wield power but to draw attention away from it. On those criteria Zaphod Beeblebrox is one of the most successful Presidents the Galaxy has ever had - he has already spent two of his ten Presidential years in prison for fraud. Very very few people realize that the President and the Government have virtually no power at all, and of these very few people only six know whence ultimate political power is wielded. Most of the others secretly believe that the ultimate decision-making process is handled by a computer. They couldn&#x27;t be more wrong.&quot;</i><p>Here in the UK, I think that if you want to change home policy, you can do that by voting.

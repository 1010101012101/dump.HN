Perhaps that's true, perhaps not.<p>When I look at this, I see an incredibly unsophisticated legal agreement. The author of the contract hardly strikes me as a knowledgable player, and I'm not inclined to assume that he <i>ever</i> had the upper hand in a battle
of wits with Zuckerberg.  In any case, the fact that a contract is poorly written doesn't automatically make me disregard it's <i>intent</i>, and here the intent of the contract is so clear that even Mark Zuckerberg -- innocent babe that he was -- could have understood it.",1279770969

For example, academic research is an area where Google's take on search does not work as well. But it will take more than the existence of such areas for Google to falter. It would take people <i>in general</i> not being able to find what they are looking for by typing a text query in a box, or finding such a means less efficient than some other. I doubt we will see anything like that before either neural interfaces or devices that can anticipate what you want without any interaction at all.",1279770889

If they see someone as a liar, a jerk, a schemer, a shark, or whatever, they will be highly ""motivated"" to find against that party so long as the law gives them any hook upon which to do so.<p>That said, my own view tends to align with yours (pvg). As I see it, this thing has ""shark"" written all over it, and the shark here will likely be seen to be Mr. Ceglia (both because of the heavily lopsided contract terms and because he is opportunistically trying to sandbag FB's shareholders - who clearly <i>are</i> innocent even if Mr. Zuckerberg is not - after lying in wait for many years, a dirty shot by any measure). I could be wrong on this, of course, but I would be quite surprised in this sort of case if someone who did what Mr. Ceglia did here would be viewed sympathetically at any phase of this court proceeding. In other words, I would say that the ""motivating factors"" for this case would tilt in favor of Mr. Zuckerberg (and Facebook) from the facts revealed so far. Reasonable minds might differ on this (with respect to Mr. Zuckerberg only), and other facts might later be revealed to alter this conclusion, but that is how I see it so far.<p>Of course, there is no accounting for how people might choose to see this outside of court but I think this tends to confirm my point that many people simply have a desire to see Mr. Zuckerberg get his comeuppance and that is why the reporting comes out the way it does as well.",1279770302

It's hard to imagine the 'everyone' who would take this contract at face value, at least, not the subset of everyone who's ever signed a lease, mortgage or employment agreement and/or has had the most passing consultation with a lawyer about one.

The stack exchange format only really works when you get a certain critical mass of people to ask questions. They have found if you get people together and people ask questions then people will come to answer them. The trick is getting enough people together to start asking questions.<p>When you have an empty site and someone sees the last question was weeks or months ago they just browse away. Helping getting the community over that initial hurdle is important.",1279768094

It makes so much sense now that this could easily be the grounding principle behind the common saying ""Do what you love and the money will follow"". If you're doing what you love, your thoughts are focused on that. When what you love is your top idea you have the focus to innovate, solve problems, etc.<p>If you're too worried about making money, you'll be too preoccupied with that to give any thought to other things. If you're too concerned with a specific outcome, you end up taking energy away from the actions that will ultimately drive any outcome at all. Focus on your top idea and the rest will follow. It's not always as simple as it sounds, but I think there's a lot of truth there.",1279768091

However, I've wondered for a while about the feasibility of an ""open-source"" camera that was designed publicly and could be produced by any manufacturer.  My guess is that high-quality sensors aren't an off-the-shelf part and so would be difficult to source and stabilization technology may also present challenges.<p>CHDK has shown that letting developers at the internals of camera operation can have cool results.

Capacitive buttons should have a longer lifespan and some ""cool factor"" over standard mechanical buttons, but they're a lot harder to use by feel. I see them as a significant step down in usability, and I don't understand why more professional reviewers don't seem to feel the same way. I don't think the lifespan is a big issue; using components of half-decent quality, the buttons should significantly exceed the standard 2-year life of a smartphone.",1279767665

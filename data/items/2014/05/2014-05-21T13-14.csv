Without such a pension plan, this would not be possible and many (especially single parent) families of government working households would be stuck to a threshold close to the poverty line.&quot;</i><p>Please can you explain to me, honestly. Why would someone that has children or plans to willingly choose to take a pay cut in exchange for a big pension fund? Sounds very selfish, because it implies that these people want to struggle to pay for their children&#x27;s upbringing and education just so that they could have a &quot;cushy middle-class&quot; retirement when the kids are out of the house. That is the quote and justification one of the posters below used when explaining why it&#x27;s okay that they get huge pensions instead of using their salary to save up for retirement like the rest of society.",1400680708

7778217,comment,7773036,7776413,0,0,exelius,,,"It all depends how much bandwidth you need for a given use case. For most use cases other than video, existing wireless technologies are sufficient and will only continue to improve as things like beam shaping and micro cells become more prevalent. Wireless is easier to deploy and as its use grows, more spectrum will likely open up. Free markets have the benefit of deploying scarce resources where they are most in demand. Implementing that spectrum is often as easy as a configuration change that can be deployed remotely.<p>The biggest advantage of a wired home broadband connection over a wireless one that I see is the ability to stream video. A wired connection has a lot of disadvantages: it&#x27;s useless outside the home and the infrastructure is significantly more expensive. Wireless has signal and coverage issues for sure, but wireless is a much more competitive industry than wired access in no small part because it&#x27;s cheaper to deploy.<p>I don&#x27;t think it would be going out on a limb to say the HN audience is much wealthier and more technology-literate than the average citizen, and thus would be more likely to want multiple Internet connections and have more use cases such as running file servers, etc. I think the HN crowd overestimates what people use their Internet connections for; the average person uses their home broadband connection primarily to watch video. It&#x27;s not a bad use case by any means; but I&#x27;m not sure the government needs to be building infrastructure that will be primarily used by video streaming companies. Traditional cellular wireless (which can use any mix of wireless, wired or satellite backhaul depending on the application) and Wi-Fi are flexible enough to cover the &quot;access&quot; part of Internet access; especially in an increasingly post-PC world.",1400680661

But the county still collected $13 million in 2012 — making it one of the state&#x27;s top revenue producers.&quot;<p>The county&#x27;s most recent budget is over $100 million. Law enforcement in its various forms is around half of that. $13 million isn&#x27;t trivial, but neither is it huge in context.<p>If you cut the fines, you&#x27;d have to increase tax revenue by a bit more than 10%. Again, not trivial, but not huge.<p>Consider that the money is <i>already there</i> and <i>already being collected</i>, it&#x27;s just that you&#x27;re disproportionately collecting it from poor people.

A simple strategy is to allocate 64 bits to a message counter and 64 bits to a block counter. For each encryption you can increment the message counter by one. The block counter starts at zero and increments for each block of the message.<p>Note that this imposes hard limits on both the number of encryptions you can perform with this key (2^64) and the number of blocks a message can contain (also 2^64). As long as we respect these limits, we&#x27;re guaranteed never to reuse a nonce.<p>If we use a random 64-bit nonce in place of the message counter, the picture changes a little. Due to the birthday paradox, we can now expect a collision in around 2^32 encryptions, which is a little close for comfort.<p>Fortunately, we can tune the bit allocations based on the needs of the application. So a reasonable strategy might be to bump the random message nonce to (say) 96 bits and leave 32 for the block counter. This still allows individual messages of around 64GB.<p>Of course, parameters like these should be considered implementation details for 99% of application developers. The best thing to do is to use a high-level library like NaCl that makes reasonable choices and then abstracts them away.",1400679457

But buying transit from larger ISP for colocation or to operate your own ISP for example, is typically done based on some combination of port speed, committed information rate (CIR) and <i>peak usage</i> within a defined interval (burst).<p>For example, at work we pay abour $6 per Mbps 95th percentile use averaged per 5 minutes, with a 10Mbps CIR and 100Mbps port speed at one of our data centres. This means we always pay for at least 10Mbps. Our ISP then measures our traffic and averages it over 5 minute intervals. They then throw away the top 5% of samples (so we can have short traffic spikes up to our port speed without paying extra), and we pay for the higher of 10Mbps and the next sample.<p>Any bandwidth above the CIR is entirely dependent on whether or not our ISP has spare capacity. The higher your requested port speed, the less likely you are of being able to burst much more than your CIR - any halfway decent provider will have 90Mbps excess capacity much of the time, so paying for 10Mbps CIR and bursting to 100Mbps is not unlikely, but paying for 1Gbps and being able to burst to 10Gbps gets far more dicy.<p>At some higher speeds some providers will only offer links where CIR == port speed - effectively a &quot;unlimited&quot; connection. If you know your bandwidth exceeds the CIR a lot of the time, you will typically want to pay for a higher CIR for the reason that you otherwise risk getting throttled even if your port speed is higher and your connection in theory is burstable.<p>Effectively the sum of the CIR of their customers + some margin is what the ISP will turn around and contract with their transit providers and peering partners for. If other customers don&#x27;t use their CIR, and your CIR is lower than your port speed, your ISP is likely to let you burst (at a cost) that moment, but traffic within the CIR (should) always have priority.",1400679202

A `seq` is anything that implements `first` and `next`, it&#x27;s a higher level abstraction than `cons` because it frees up `()` and `nil` from `car` and `cdr` [or `first` and `rest`]. At a higher level the abstraction facilitates differentiating a breadth first search tree from a depth first search tree as types of data structures (though I&#x27;m not necessarily advocating the idea). Sure it could be done in a traditional Lisp but the best case sausage factory is probably less sanitary.<p>I&#x27;m not making a case that Clojure is better than other Lisps - getting rid of `cons` and relying on the JVM has makes typing more critical in an environment that retains a degree of type opacity typical of dynamic type systems.",1400679160

Concurrency Model (we&#x27;re in a multicore world)\n  2. Data Processing (data is driving everything)\n  3.

I think Go is going to be <i>the</i> language to emerge as the dominant player in the next 10 years.<p>All three languages work on App Engine, and Google&#x27;s Cloud offering is another one of those &quot;skate to where the puck is going&quot; things. It&#x27;s already the most technically advanced cloud, and you can see signs that it&#x27;s about to catch a Google-fueled hockey stick and blow past AWS at an exponential pace.<p>Honorable Mention: Scala.<p>Scala is in use by big companies like Twitter and LinkedIn, and it&#x27;s the code behind some of the key open-source systems like Spark, Finagle, and Kafka. And Spark&#x27;s the data-processing skate-puck destination: Cloudera is adopting it, and the days running up to the Hadoop eclipse keep growing shorter so I suspect Scala and I will keep crossing paths as these tools continue to make the rounds.",1400679139

I was getting paid an alright salary for it being an early startup who had raised funding or launched yet. I made it a point to make sure I didn&#x27;t stay late at the office unless it was an absolutely necessity. So I didn&#x27;t have the extreme hours to deal with, but rather the uncertainty... Not knowing if your next paycheck is going to be one of your lasts or not is not a way I want to live. Having a family to provide for is a bigger and much more important job than grinding out code for a startup that has the potential to be big.<p>Because of the uncertainty and risks that come with working in a startup, I pursued other options. I ended up talking with a smaller software development agency here that has the startup atmosphere in the office (doesnt feel like some corporate job). They are very well off and there is very little chance of them failing or running out of work. The increased salary and full benefits were easily enough for me to leave the startup where I had a slightly less salary, but 20% equity. The 20% equity definitely had the potential to have some huge payoffs, but I wouldn&#x27;t see those for atleast 5 years, and I much rather have guaranteed stability now rather than hoping for it to come later.",1400678490

7777970,comment,7771524,7773236,1,0,userbinator,,,"To me, whether it&#x27;s NP-complete is of little concern, since humans have been allocating registers (and beating compilers) with little difficulty. On the contrary, I feel that being labeled as NP-complete has somehow slowed the development of better RA algorithms, on the basis that it&#x27;s &quot;too hard&quot;. There&#x27;s a saying &quot;one of the first steps to accomplishing something is to believe that it&#x27;s possible&quot;, and if people believe that RA is a more difficult problem than it really is, then that has a discouraging effect. NP-completeness is only related to the complexity as the problem size increases, but in practice the problem sizes aren&#x27;t that big --- e.g. within a function, having several dozen live variables at a time is probably extremely uncommon, and machines don&#x27;t have that many registers - a few dozen at most.<p>I think the human brain is probably Turing-equivalent, but it also likely doesn&#x27;t matter -- if I can describe the algorithm that I, as a human, take to perform compiler-beating register allocation and instruction selection, then a machine can probably do it just as well if not faster than me since it can consider many more alternatives and at a much faster rate.<p>I agree that heuristic approaches are the way to go, but in a &quot;too far abstracted&quot; model like graph colouring, some  heuristics just can&#x27;t be easily used; e.g. the technique of &quot;clearing the table&quot; --- setting up all the registers prior to a tight loop, so that the instructions within do not have to access memory at all. Using push/pop (x86) for &quot;very ephemerally-spilled&quot; values is another one.",1400677650

I rode the Rails train in the past and recently embarked on a real web project with Compojure.<p>At first it felt like a very mixed bag. There are a number of reasonable if boring things that Rails provides that help make it easier to get your app production-ready––robust logging and asset compilation come to mind––that generally have to be hand-rolled in Compojure (as in microframeworks in other languages). More generally, there aren&#x27;t many clear signposts from an architectural point of view––for example, there does not appear to be much community guidance over how to organize your namespaces, or how much code one should contain. We made some messes early on.<p>Once my partner and I got past the initial pain, however, we were extremely pleased with our choice.

As we &quot;complexify&quot; each layer, we end up having to have specialists in just one area to get it to work well. We&#x27;ve pushed way beyond the point of diminishing returns.<p>And it&#x27;s been done in pieces a lot. F#, for instance, has a couple plugins that allow it to generate either F# script on the server OR Javascript on the client. So you write one web page (a la PHP or the old VB) then annotate where you want each function to run. It automagically takes care of handling the data movement between functions over the client/server wire. I could easily see extending this metaphor to where data types lived on the &quot;database&quot; instead of stack. You&#x27;d just code it in one spot, then add/tweak annotations as needed to change the database to redis, MySQL, etc.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of future here if somebody ran with this.

I won&#x27;t speak to Erlang&#x27;s philosophies or paradigms, but I would like to respond to the bit about Go&#x27;s handling of errors.<p>I recall Rob Pike making an argument that errors are not, or should not be, special things, and so Go doesn&#x27;t treat them as such. If you don&#x27;t care about an error and don&#x27;t want to deal with it, simply ignore it:<p><pre><code>  image, _ = jpeg.Decode(r)\n</code></pre>\nIf you care about an error and need to do something to handle it (a log, a panic, or something more complicated), you can signal that to the compiler.<p>One advantage of this is you still have access to the returned bit of data, however mangled or incomplete it _might_ be, which can be useful in certain instances.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I consider Go errors &quot;silly&quot; unless all you&#x27;re doing is a panic every few lines. In actual practice, though, I have found I can pick and choose when I care about an error, and if I do care about it, there&#x27;s an action specific to that error I want to perform. Hardly silly - cumbersome perhaps.<p>As for your statement, &quot;On the Go side, it mostly sticks errors in your face and makes damn sure you do something sensible with them ... &quot; I reject the notion that in Go you are forced to deal with errors, but I also reject the notion you shouldn&#x27;t do something sensible when you are dealing with them. :)<p>Great work all the same!

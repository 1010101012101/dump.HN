238999,comment,238806,238806,0,0,jcl,,,"I ran across the Ravi Mohan post last year that compares Jeffries' and Norvig's approaches to solving Sudoku.  Upon reading the actual articles, I felt that the comments in that thread were somewhat unfair.<p>Jeffries explicitly states that he is unfamiliar with Sudoku and rusty with Ruby, so of course he is going to make mistakes as he seeks a solution; it doesn't help his perceived credibility that he makes lots of little mistakes and documents his fixes for each one.  His Test-Driven Design approach makes for a long and boring read, but it is what enabled him to make as much progress as he did.<p>Norvig, on the other hand, has a masterful command of Python and has probably worked through dozens of Sudoku by hand, never mind that he is intimately familiar with constraint propagation and doesn't bother describing any problems he had typing up the program.<p>To Jeffries' credit, he seems to hit upon the same solution as Norvig in the very first article (a ""tree-trimming"" solution, as he puts it), but he doesn't get around to implementing it.  He states that he doesn't think it will run fast enough for all puzzles -- a perfectly reasonable concern that Norvig ducks entirely by running his solution on a hundred puzzles and timing them, then assuming they constitute the hardest puzzles the algorithm will encounter, in the astronomical space of all puzzles.  It's not an unreasonable assumption, but it is an assumption nonetheless; there could well be a Sudoku puzzle out there that causes Norvig's algorithm to run an unreasonably long time.",1215456524

You might also be able to find a binary version on the site where you downloaded from (look for .deb files).<p>If that's not an option (which is possible with FF3 if you're using an older version of Ubuntu) then chances are you need to build the software you downloaded from source and this is where it gets more complicated (although not that complicated unless you happen to get errors).<p>In case anyone is new to Linux and curious here are the typical steps to building a package from source.<p><pre><code>  > wget http://example.com/somefile.tar.gz (or you can download with the browser)

238994,comment,238571,238967,0,0,astine,,,"Perhaps I should clarify then? Tobacco farmers goes back generations and make up a significant part of the traditional economy. They are taxed heavily and contribute a lot to the local and national economies. In general, marijuana farming goes back about generation, is not taxed (for obvious reasons)  and very few people who grow marijuana really on it for there sole income. Enough of it is imported so that it is not really seen as 'American.' Maybe I'm biased, being from Virginia and having friends and associated who are small time tobacco farmers (and are nothing like the faceless monsters you see on anti-smoking adds,) But the relationship of tobacco to the economy, and the relation of marijuana to the economy are different, both in function and in perception (which is what really matters.)<p>BTW, your link is fixed.
------------------------<p>Edit: That article emphasized my point.<p>Which isn't that one is good or the other is bad, but the relationship of either to our economy is different. While production of marijuana is increasing, most of it is controlled and distributed by groups that are considered foreign, like the Mexican mob for example. In fact, a great deal of it is grown by recent immigrants whose families are being held hostage in their home countries.<p>Needless to say this could change in light of legalization,   but it's current stature is what plays a key role right now.  As it stands, the people who get rich off of marijuana aren't Americans.<p>So while legalization of Marijuana may benefit society monetarily, there is no particular interest group that stands to get rich or on which the government already depends. This was even more true at the time of the original criminalization. It's a matter of why, not whether. I've stated elsewhere that I believe marijuana ought to be legal and I'm stating here why it isn't and tobacco is.<p>I mentioned small tobacco farmers for a different reason. Taxes, restrictions and lawsuits against tobacco increase everyday and everyday small tobacco farmers loose ground to larger tobacco firms which can deal more efficiently with the restrictions. As the restrictions increase, small tobacco will go out of business and if criminalize, the larger firms will give way to cartels every bit as troublesome as the Mexican mob. Legalize either and their's no guarantee that either will come back as a wholesome industry. (Given prohibition, it seems likely, but isn't a given.)<p>So those that oppose one and support the other aren't necessarily hypocrites so much as tunnel visioned. Which is all I really have to say.",1215456293

For boys, it's really not a big deal because there are plenty of ways for younger and older men to have entirely appropriate relationships.<p>Not so much for girls.  Even if I were single, I think I'd have to be careful with girls, and more careful as the age gets lower.  Girls tend to bond with and be attracted to male affection, and the ideal source for that is their own father (assuming the father is on the up-and-up) even through a time of courtship (courtship is about making the transition from a father's affection to a mate's affection).  It would be entirely inappropriate for me as a grown man to allow a non-adult girl to have misplaced bonding because of my affections, even if they were entirely innocent.<p>Since I'm married, this is a double no-no.

In particular, writing tests that only fail when the code is broken (and not just because the test is broken) is often incredibly difficult, and if you have (like we do) more than 40,000 unit tests, even a small false-positive rate like .1% will mean that a simple check-in could require hours of test rewriting not because the code is broken but because the tests are poorly written or make too many assumptions about implementation details.  Even the best, most disciplined teams create some ""bad"" tests, and it doesn't take many to start killing you.<p>Similarly, in a real software environment where a code base lives for years and undergoes numerous changes, you often end up with stale tests that either no longer test anything useful or which enforce requirements that have since been changed.<p>So while the tests are invaluable and I can't imagine not having them, at the same time there are a lot of issues with test maintenance over the long term that become very difficult to deal with.",1215455373

So personally, I tend to do TDD when I know where I'm going, but for exploratory programming I write the minimal amount of high-level tests to test things end-to-end and make sure things kind of work at all and back-fill more detailed tests once the code has settled down a bit.",1215454689

In other words, when I only have paper and pencil, I miss Mockups.<p>- JimEngland: polish in a mockup is the enemy of usability. People get attached to gradients, icons and whatever element is more polished in a mockup and forget to think about what really mattes, which is the layout and choice of controls. Mockups is designed to feel like paper, but be collaborative (via wikis) and immediately digital.<p>- tortilla: collaboration/interaction is enabled in the wiki version of Mockups.

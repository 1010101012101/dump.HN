In fact, the day after SOPA fell, I joined the Free Software Foundation as an associate member.<p>Well, it just so happens that they've been having a membership drive! Their goal is $300,000, and they only have about $20,000 to go. Let's make this last day the best they've had yet!<p>The FSF, in the coming year, will be defending our rights in the UEFI secure boot case. They will be continuing their efforts to bring more people to stream free formats like Ogg Vorbis. They will also, of course, be hacking on cool software like GNU Social, GNU MediaGoblin, and GNU Emacs (though I'm sure some of them use Vi)!<p>Consider making a donation this year, to support this great organization through a difficult time.<p>It's $10/month, or $5 per month for students. You can also pay yearly if you prefer. You get some cool benefits, including five email addresses (forward only), a USB membership card with Trisquel GNU/Linux, and access to the members-only forums on my.fsf.org.<p>Once again, head on over to https://my.fsf.org/associate/support_freedom?referrer=10428 and donate today!<p>Feel free to remove my referral information, but I don't mind taking credit if you don't mind giving it :) also, if you can forward this information through any channel at all, please do so.<p>Thanks, everyone!",1328018244

Its so easy to just throw the whole stack at a problem or kill a fly with a shotgun. This is always the way, and its why new ideas rarely displace the old ones directly. Instead, they have to appeal to a younger, nascent market that are not attached to the old product.<p>Padrinos best bet is to appeal to a younger, fresher group of programmers who havent spent years learning Rails, just as Rails appealed to a younger, fresh generation of programmers who hadnt spent years learning Struts. Those folks will find applications for it where Rails actually gets in their way. As they reinvent parts os Rails, theyll invent new things that fit their model domain better than Rails does.<p>Id bet that if Padrino becomes successful, it will do so with ORMs and other gems that arent popular on Rails because they havent been invented yet.<p>If you are resistant to adopting a new framework and having to reinvent a bunch of stuff, congratulations.

3533142,story,,,3,1,ideaoverload,"Ask HN:investing in mobile game development",,"I am considering funding development of two smartphone games. Games would be developed by 5 person development studio. We are based in Europe. The idea is that studio could use extra funding to build portfolio and make more money and obviously I could make some money of it as well. The deal we plan is my investment of X% of development budget and getting Y% of return in game sales where X is close/equal to Y. Game concept looks good ( yes I know is extremely vague description, game is in sports category )<p>About me: I have developer's background but I don't code for living for ~10 years. I am able to verify game studio experience and skill set but I am not a gamer at all (mobile nor console). Last time I spent serious time playing games was in Commodore 64 heydays... I consider my lack of mobile gaming experience biggest drawback.<p>About game studio: limited portfolio of mobile games - 5 titles, only one quite successful in number of countries ( ~4 times return on 1 man-year development budget). They have pretty good understanding of technology and some design talent. Significant experience on PS console an older devices like Gameboy. They have every good, well known publisher.<p>Obviously the biggest risk is if the games are going to catch on and get sales. Even more obvious - coming up with good game concept is the hardest part and mobile game market is crowded<p>Did any anyone try this kind of investment approach from investor or hacker perspective? Would you take a shot at estimating  risk and expected value of return?

In these cases, it is imperative to consider the marginal cost of alternative/off-site failover vs. the cost of downtime. This is what I meant by ""separate the men from the boys"". Those guys who are paying the incredible premium to continue to host on Heroku likely -know- that they are doing so, and have made that decision consciously.<p>While the situation is different, I am reminded of when AWS went down awhile back and the sites that had automated failover to alternative clouds really stood out.<p>The bottom line is that no one solution is ever enough.

When running one or two server processes, I don't care that it consumes 30MB more RAM than it should, or renders take two milliseconds longer than they could. If I did, I would use something else instead of ruby. However, when I actually try to use that one neat feature, only to remember that it's Rails-specific, or find out that this gem I'm not familiar with has documentation only as far as Rails-integration is concerned, that's a real and measurable dip in my productivity.<p>These small projects are usually weekend hacks where I would rather not spend time writing boilerplate I know can be replaced by one line by that other framework, or digging through sources of a library before I can start using it. It gets very tempting to just throw in the whole Rails stack and focus on the interesting bits.<p>These problems could be alleviated by more widespread use of other Ruby web frameworks (and I do wish they gain more traction!). But right now, my laziness keeps me from 'being part of the solution'.",1328015958

If you are big you are paying an incredible premium to be on Heroku (thought experiment: when does the premium start costing more than a full-time systems engineer).  There is no Heroku equivalent from another company, at least nothing that's really turnkey in the same way, so if you build redundancy you're throwing away the benefit of Heroku's PaaS.<p>So in my mind if you need redundancy you need to be building your own system stack.  Whether it's co-located, dedicated, or cloud-based is a separate issue because it's more or less commoditized.  You build your system on a portable platform and then redundancy is just a proportional amount of extra work.",1328015039

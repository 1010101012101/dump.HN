Whether it's because of battery life, lousy app selection, annoying add-ons by the carrier, or clunky app design</i><p>In the Eclaire days, with sparse apps and a clunky, half-broken OS, you were absolutely right.<p>Today, however, you couldn't be further off the mark. A Gingerbread phone is a delightful, delightful beast. The app selection and quality has improved at a blistering pace.<p><i>I think this will all bite Google when few people decide to upgrade to a new Android phone. The experience is so mediocre that even a few minutes playing with an iPhone, browsing the app store, or talking to the owner about battery life will cause tremendous buyers remorse.</i><p>You mention the Evo yet EVERY SINGLE REVIEW criticized the battery life. How could you possibly not know about that?<p>Experience so mediocre? Your obsolete bias shows through. I would argue that a good Froyo device, or a normal Gingerbread phone, provides a far better experience to most users.<p>This page is thinly veiled fanboyism (and, unsurprisingly, was linked by Gruber, which speaks volumes). Worse, it isn't even CORRECT -- they used both an ancient Meebo app, and an ancient Facebook app, to demonstrate their poorly-demonstrated-anyways point. I would seriously consider Marcos Arment as a suspect behind it: His desperation has grown obvious.",1302267591

2423514,comment,2421943,2422364,6,0,jarek,,,"This really hits on a key point: there is practically no money to be made B2C on Android. <i>And this is normal.</i> Historically there has rarely been a software business made rich by B2C. It's much easier to sell large-volume to businesses than it is to deal with fickle individual users.<p>Adobe doesn't sell most Photoshop licenses to individual users, they sell to businesses for whom the cost of pirating is not worth it. Windows licenses sold to individual users are dwarfed by Windows licenses sold to manufacturers, who buy it because that's what <i>their</i> customers expect. Opera gives away its various browsers, then uses the expertise and the satisfied customer base as arguments when licensing preloaded versions to manufacturers. Swype isn't selling its product to individual users in the app store for $4.99, they're selling to manufacturers whose customers appreciate or demand this software out of the box. Facebook isn't selling its apps or website access because it's so much easier to just sell eyeballs to advertisers.<p>Games are the major exception, but they only account for so much.<p>In the physical world, it's by and large the intermediaries that sell to individual users. Most companies producing physical stuff — especially non-premium products that are supposed to sell at scale — don't open their own stores and often outsource issues like individual warranty handling to third parties.<p>I heavily suspect the iPhone B2C model is an anomaly that may soon be corrected.",1302267201

Movie dubbing and such definitely plays a big part of this, as language is largely assimilated by listening to it. If you're taught English by a French person and you never hear anyone else speak English, well, you're going to be a lot worse at English than someone with a comparable education who has more access to spoken English.<p>It's a shame that the study only shows results per country, and not per language region in countries. For instance in Belgium there are three language regions -- Dutch, French and German -- and I'm willing to bet that the results in each region are much closer to those of Holland/France/Germany than this meaningless average.<p>The reason why English is rather hard for speakers of Asian languages should be pretty obvious: there is such a <i>big</i> difference in sounds. The sounds used in English are <i>much</i> closer to those used in Spanish than Japanese, even though English and Spanish are already miles apart..",1302264883

We have one of the highest qualities of life and some of the strongest freedoms than at any other point in time.

So for instance my workflow would be:\n- write a cucumber test (if you spend more than 10 minutes on a single test, it's clearly too complicated or not granular enough) \n- check emails (if any), answer (I'm amazed at someone here saying he needs 1h+ to answer a single email. Sure this can happen, but less than 1% of the time.)\n- watch the cucumber test fail and write the corresponding feature (again if more than 10 minutes, then you clearly don't know how this works)\n- check emails (if any), answer\n- write ruby on rails code to make the test's step work\n- rince & repeat<p>I have to add I'm not just a developer - I'm a startup founder.

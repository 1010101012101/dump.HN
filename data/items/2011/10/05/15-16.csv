3076197,comment,3075221,3075693,6,0,discreteevent,,,"I agree. The simplest way to make this clear is to simply let the Greek banks default (and any other banks for that matter). This will expose the German banks and the German Government will be forced to bail them out. This bailout will be a much easier sell than the current one as it will be clear to the German taxpayer that they are bailing out their own banks who made bad bets out of greed, lack of diligence and just plain ineptitude(just like all the other bankers around the world).<p>There is this constant argument about ""confidence"" going around. We must maintain investor confidence etc. There is a limit to that and its much shorter than its usually stretched to. I've seen the same thing in software where management will cover up a systems flaws and press on with new features. In the end it all falls apart and a post mortem always reveals that they should have faced up to the problems sooner. So f<i></i>k confidence, the whole thing is going to fall apart anyway and the longer we leave it the harder it will be to fix. Let the Greeks default and let the bankers take the hit, replace them with some talented young people (there are plenty) and lets get fixing things now that they are no longer covered up.",1317830375

Hype up killer pie-in-the-sky feature that makes zero economic sense for Apple (see: retina iPad, 4G iPhone with larger screen). Traffic spikes.<p>2. As launch approaches, use ""inside sources"" to mock up designs (Macrumors's ""we <i>think</i> the 5 will look like this"").

Since the queues work from a shared thread pool and are managed at the kernel level, a long-running Fib calculation won't hold up other blocks from processing on any concurrent queue (it would still hold up a sequential queue...obviously).<p>* Use dispatch_sources to do your IO. Now you don't have to worry about clumsy callbacks, and your IO operations are perfectly happy co-existing with your long-running computations.<p>* Use dispatch_read/dispatch_write to persist to disk and you don't have to worry about different latency and throughput characteristics of files vs sockets<p>...and to the point about signals:<p>* Use a signal dispatch_source to do things in response to signals that you would never have thought possible. This is possible because libdispatch sets up a trampoline to catch the actual signal and then turn around and queue your dispatch_source block.

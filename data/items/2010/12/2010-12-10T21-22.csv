Maybe people specializing in the Internet, because it's so immature, but even then the closest I think it comes is somebody like Blake Ross and Firefox, and I don't think that's quite brilliant enough to count. (It <i>is</i> very popular, though.)<p>But it's easier nowadays to educate yourself than it ever has been before. That was partly my point: More people are teaching themselves about more <i>things</i> than has been possible in the past. Certainly if I'd been born 10 years earlier, I wouldn't be nearly as well-off as I am now (though this theoretical 30-year-old me would be wiser than the 20-year-old actual me, of course).

Many of those people, including some of the community here, decided to directly respond to it; loads of them, I assure you, were critical. Similarly, I've launched web sites on Hacker News and learned a lot from the critical feedback; my essays and the subsequent comments were similarly devastating.<p>If anything, I'd say that self-publishing makes it even <i>easier</i> for others to rip me to shreds.

The types in Socionics don't map one-to-one onto MBTI types, but the general idea of what the grandparent is saying is supported by the concept of ""dual"" types within Socionics.  The basic idea behind a duals is that you get along best with people who share your attitudes/proclivities, but have complementary strengths/weaknesses within those dispositions. And yes, meeting duals is often pretty hard, especially for certain pairs, because they move in different social circles and environments.<p>It's very interesting stuff and it seems to me like it's onto something, but it's still pretty fringe, and has not been convincingly statistically validated yet. I'm very interested in formalizing these notions and subjecting them to statistically well-founded empirical tests. Right now there's a lot of enthusiasm for Socionics in Russia, but not much work in the Western world. Email or IM me if interested in chatting about this.<p>Also, since it's so new, beware of crackpottery... there's some people who claim absurd things like being able to determine someone's dominant Socionic type just by seeing a photograph.",1292015821

We have a few modified bots (supybot is the most common, I think) that developers have written and run themselves, but I don't think any of them are much more than playthings.<p>I could definitely see having the ability to allow a bot change the topic of a channel though, so, for example, the deployment status channel's topic shows the most recent version deployed, or the status of the current deployment, for those case where you're not sitting in the channel.

it should suffice to say that moving and even typing come at a price.<p>When I was near your age a dear friend of mine, Regina Riley, was kind

fascinated, and fascination is a choice.<p>An alternate, but equally accurate, way to phrase it is; interesting
people are interested, and interest is a choice.<p>You must choose to be interested. You must choose to be fascinated. It
might be a thing, or a field, or a topic, or even another person. Your
choice is an investment, and every investment has a price. It may or may
not be the very best investment you could make, but it is guaranteed to
pay off in some way.<p>In taking the time to type this, I chose to have an interest in you as a

with making a difference in your life by sharing something that was

this will be helpful to you in any way. It may have been a poor choice

So, we added a separate thread from comments and questions @ <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1993194"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1993194</a> ]<p>We are a profitable YC Winter 2011 company.  We are hiring.  Looking for our first marketing (great writer, smart, technical) and Bus Dev (can sell ice to Eskimos and have them pay recurring support) hires.<p>We are hoping to tap the smart and highly motivated pool of people who apply to YC.  Experience is certainly helpful, but definitely not required.  We look for the same things that YC looks for.<p>For marketing/online marketing we are looking for:<p><pre><code>  * proven great writing ability
  * good technical skills (marketing is very technical these days,
    and we have a reasonably technical product)
  * strong interest in making money
  * (PG would be a good hire here, but we can't afford him :-)
</code></pre>
For Bus Dev we are looking for:<p><pre><code>  * very strong sales and negotiating skills
  * good understanding of business in general
  * strong interest in making money
</code></pre>
This would be an opportunity to get a taste of YC with a different risk/reward tradeoff.  You'll spend next three months doing nothing but work.  You'll own as much responsibility and authority in the company as you can possibly handle.  Going forward you will become the top management team of the company.<p>Compensation will be between an employee and founder: lots of equity and a livable salary.  We do offer big-company style heath insurance and other benefits.<p>The company does Enterprise software SaaS.  The founders are all technical.  We are located on the Peninsula and may move to Mountain View proper for the duration of YC.<p>How to apply:<p>Email us @ ycw11company@gmail.com Please include your resume (if you have one, or some alternative) and tell us why you would be a good fit.",1292014825

I remember when I got in a '93 Mercedes SL 500 in the rain and when I slowed down so did the windshield wipers. I know others replicated the behavior in later models, but driving that car made me realize that every other car was designed by people who didn't, apparently, drive cars.<p>I love using the 'smart tab positioning' example: how many times have people moved the mouse to close 4 or 5 tabs? Sure, it's not an impossible headache. But most of us do it regularly enough that it's nice to have the button in the same place for each tab. It's almost as if the designers used a web browser before. And it's great.<p>And hard to imagine giving up.",1292014809

At Poll Everywhere we pay a premium to SMS aggregators to have a short code (99503) and higher priority connections to cell networks. You could tap into the SMS network entirely via email, but the latency is too high for our needs.<p>The situation is awful, and paints a nasty picture of what the web would look like if it were not for net neutrality.",1257558888

927363,comment,925995,926469,0,0,larryfreeman,,,"I am unable to understand this viewpoint that you can only have ""pure"" free-markets without government.<p>There can be no free market without government unless you define government as ""official"" government.  If you define government more loosely as a ""governing body"", then it is clear that government must always exist in a free market system because conflicts and disagreements will always exist.<p>The governing body is a  necessary factor in economic system.<p>I would argue the free markets never exist in a 100% free state.  To talk as if they do is really to ignore the realities and complexities of modern economic systems.",1257558775

927360,comment,925995,926351,0,0,larryfreeman,,,"Property rights need to be protected or an economic system falls into anarchy.  On a small scale, it is possible for the community to enforce these rights (in which case, the community has formed a local government) but on the larger, societal scale, a transcommunity government is needed (or a warlord/city boss/etc appears which is, by its nature, a form of government).<p>If all free trade actions could be resolved by rational, respectful, interaction of two individuals of integrity (ie they keep their word), then no government is needed.  As far as I can tell, if such a world existed, we wouldn't be having this discussion.<p>As long as individuals need to collaborate in order to resolve disagreements, as long as certain individuals need to take responsibilities for overseeing these collaborations, government is necessary.",1257558428

Never before have I seen a group of self-proclaimed progressives be this bigoted and ignorant, yet fast on the trigger when it comes to condemning just about anyone or anything - e.g., Sears, the constant posts about tazers, the giant hate-on for all law enforcement, etc.<p>Recently there have been some pretty clear racist undertones running throughout the site (anti-Muslim, in particular). Reddit prides itself in being a community of self-ascribed liberals and progressives - but I don't see it at all in the behaviour of its userbase.<p>Nowadays I mostly only go to the photography subreddits, that are still generally populated by reasonable people willing to discuss as opposed to fight. Niche subreddits may be the only places left on the site that doesn't make me mentally throw up every time I try to read it.",1257557405

The advantage we <i>think</i> we have over writing their own Python (or Hadoop, or...) on EC2 is that it's just easier to put these things together in a spreadsheet environment.

Ultimately, what we're trying to do is provide an easy-to-use way for people to access large-scale computing resources.  It just so happens that a spreadsheet-like interface turns out to be a great way of doing that, but that doesn't mean we need to bill ourselves immediately as ""a spreadsheet"".<p>(Also -- it sounds like we should be promoting the option of running the app on local server farms more heavily.)",1299685815

2305080,comment,2304779,2304779,0,0,cletus,,,"We live in interesting times.<p>Apple created the iPhone. Now every (smart) phone looks like an iPhone. Android has equaled or exceeded iPhone shipments through a combination of factors (lower price points, more carriers in the US and so forth).<p>Apple reinvented the tablet as a capacitive touch device very much like the iPhone. Everyone copies that design. People predict the same outcome in the tablet market as happened in the phone market.<p>I disagree, for several reasons:<p>Firstly, the base functionality for a phone is much higher than that of a tablet. A phone can make and receive calls, make and receive SMSs and (in the category we're talking about) browse the Web. At that point you've covered over 90% of the usage of most people.<p>Tablets are (IMHO) a different beast. I haven't seen stats on this (I'd love to, if they exist) but I would guess, as an iPad (and iPhone) owner, two things:<p>1. A greater percentage of iPad owners buy apps than iPhone owners;<p>2. iPad owners buy a larger number of apps than iPhone owners;<p>3. iPad apps on average cost more (although this gap is narrowing and will probably disappear); and<p>4. iPad users spend more time in nonstandard (standard being mail, maps, photos and Web browser) than smart phone users.<p>If true--and I stress again that the above is my  <i>guess</i>--the conclusion you reach is that the apps, and the infrastructure that goes around that (including payment and developer ecosystems) are far more important in the tablet market than the phone market.<p>Secondly, in the US at least, people generally choose carrier first and handset second. In all places, people first make a decision around having mobile phone service (and usage) and then buy a handset/plan.<p>Tablets on the other hand are primarily used at home or in the office. While 3G models sell very well and people have 3G data services, I would guess that the overwhelming majority of iPad usage is on Wifi, unlike phones.<p>Third, Apple is leading the market on <i>price</i>. What kind of topsy-turvy world do we live in where Apple leads the market on <i>price</i>?<p>Apple has beautifully designed products with the best ecosystem that lead the market on price. How exactly is this not Apple's game to lose?<p>Drawing parallels between what happened in phones and what's happening in tablets is (IMHO) foolish.<p>As for the OP's claims, there are four basic methods that we have for writing stuff today:<p>1. Audio and/or video recording;<p>2. Using a physical keyboard and/or mouse;<p>3. Using a touch surface; and<p>4. Using pen and paper.<p>For students who want to take notes and so forth my opinion is that old-fashioned pen and paper and the almost archaic keyboard will rule the roost for some time to come. They just have inherent advantages in input speed and flexibility. Even a stylus on a tablet just can't compete (IMHO).",1299684104

One, design has traditionally had tenets from on high and views that since there are actual physiological limits to what the human body can read, there are set rules. Because of the acceptance of rules, there's acceptance of  leaders in the industry whose trendsetting generally spans the next few years, much like the fashion world. However fickle design trends are, most clients aren't interested in novel solutions, they prefer to use whatever's popular. And, because there's no space for actual innovation, there's no need to discuss how to be innovative, unlike in programming. Basically, design is less creative then programming because nobody wants you to be creative.<p>Two. Since design is a visual science, you end up getting a lot of people who're in it for the lifestyle to be cool, as opposed to here where people are into programming because they truly love it. In programming, the weak members go home and watch tv. In design, they go home and talk about design. These daytrippers tend to weaken the community, and force gated communities like Dribble and Forrst which further enable the class mentality in design. If these communities aren't gated, there's a huge influx of quasi-designers who wish to pad their marketing. However, this insularity tends to ostracize anyone outside of the class system.<p>Three. There's been a traditional, accepted path for ""real"" designers: some freelance, then joining up with an agency, and then forming your own agency. Because this path is already well established in meatspace, there's no reason to form a board online: all the important stuff is going on in the back rooms of print shops and studios.<p>Marxism in my design?

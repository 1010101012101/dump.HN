B2B... so we'll see how that goes.<p>also, my answer is relevant because with more users comes expansion. my social networking site (before the phrase was coined so feverishly) started with 10 people initially signing up. i had launched the day prior to my vacation and didn't return for 2 weeks. word-of-mouth spread it like wildfire and when I returned... 20k people has signed up. with that however, came the server and bandwidth bill (I was using a shared hosting plan). technically, it made me broke for time (fixing everything that broke and eventually broke during my transfer to the dedicated server) and financially it drained me (back when dedicated servers cost and arm, leg, first born and your dog fluffy). =P",1190019585

I get really tired of all the bs stories with the founders who claim that they just told some friends and then woke up with ten million users the next day.",1190019059

55604,comment,55320,55320,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Mathematical statements are not unambiguous if you mean anything more than just syntactical consistency, which is by definition meaningless. Maths is a means to make statements about the world and thus depends on analysis and modeling. Modeling is by no means unambiguous as anyone who ever created a data model will be able to confirm. So maths is either meaningless or ambiguous if seen in its application context.<p>The issue goes even deeper. You could argue that the above argument is a semantic trick, because modeling is outside the realm of maths as a science. But even the formal foundations are in doubt if you consider Goedels incompleteness theorems (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAXdel%27s_incompleteness_theorems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAXdel%27s_incompleteness_theor...</a>)<p>Sorry, the link is broken.

So, at lest, we get a chance to apply algorithmic techniques to these things. However, we're not very far along. It's more complicated to analyse biographies of criminals to devise effective crime prevention/rehabilitation measures than to figure out buying patterns in supermarkets.",1190016324

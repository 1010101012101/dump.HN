3461847,comment,3460945,3461573,4,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>I am actually astonished that this is the first time something like this is tried in the US. And I also don't understand the negative comments here in HN</i><p>Specialized high schools are moderately common in the United States, some organized as general public schools, and some organized as ""charter"" schools (a form of regulation in the United States with public funding, but less public funding than most schools, and some variation in regulations that apply to general public schools). In my part of the United States, Minnesota, there is public school open enrollment (any student can enroll in any public school district, anywhere in the state) and quite a few charter schools (Minnesota was the first state to have any charter schools). My public school district receives students from forty-one public school districts, the farthest one more than 100 miles away. (I've heard that the child stays with relatives during the school week and goes back to his parents' home on weekends. That is perfectly legal here in Minnesota.) There is another charter school, far across the metropolitan area from where I live, that purports to be a Math and Science Academy.<p><a href=""http://www.mnmsa.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mnmsa.org/</a><p>But as I think any European or east Asian reader of the school's website will soon recognize, the Math and Science Academy charter school in Minnesota does not have a credible academic program in mathematics or science up to international standards. (One of my good friends had a child in that school, and she is bitterly disappointed by how much the school killed her daughter's interest in mathematics and science with its underchallenging curriculum.) A regular public school in Minnesota is permitted to have an internal program that is academically selective, for example a ""school within a school"" for gifted students, as my local school district does<p><a href=""http://www.minnetonka.k12.mn.us/ACADEMICS/NAVIGATORPROGRAM/Pages/default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.minnetonka.k12.mn.us/ACADEMICS/NAVIGATORPROGRAM/P...</a><p>and as other Minnesota public school districts had first.<p><a href=""http://www.invergrove.k12.mn.us/atheneum.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.invergrove.k12.mn.us/atheneum.html</a><p><a href=""http://www.springlakeparkschools.org/schools/la/la_lighthouse.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.springlakeparkschools.org/schools/la/la_lighthous...</a><p><a href=""http://department.services.bloomington.k12.mn.us/modules/cms/pages.phtml?pageid=201931&sessionid="" rel=""nofollow"">http://department.services.bloomington.k12.mn.us/modules/cms...</a><p>By contrast, charter schools in Minnesota cannot be academically selective in any way, but must accept all applicants (which is also the plan for the New York City school in the submitted article), allocating spaces by lottery if the number of applicants exceeds the number of spaces. That is one of several ways in which regulations on charter schools are more restrictive than the regulations on regular public school districts.<p>Minnesota has a specialized program for mathematics only<p><a href=""http://www.mathcep.umn.edu/umtymp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mathcep.umn.edu/umtymp/</a><p>that draws in students from all over the Twin Cities metropolitan area for classes at the University of Minnesota. I like that program a lot. My oldest son is an alumnus, and I will have two other children take that program's qualifying test in a few months, for two different entry points into that program.<p>In general, the cultural attitude in the United States is highly hostile to advanced programs for bright learners, as you can see in some of the comments here. Many programs for ""gifted"" students may not even have added value for academic growth,<p><a href=""http://educationnext.org/poor-results-for-high-achievers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://educationnext.org/poor-results-for-high-achievers/</a><p>academic achievement even in wealthy school districts is often below the standards achieved in poorer countries,<p><a href=""http://globalreportcard.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://globalreportcard.org/</a><p>and the United States especially lags behind in teaching mathematics to its most advanced students.<p><a href=""http://www.hks.harvard.edu/pepg/PDF/Papers/PEPG10-19_HanushekPetersonWoessmann.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hks.harvard.edu/pepg/PDF/Papers/PEPG10-19_Hanushe...</a><p>So I'm glad to see the New York City experiment in offering a software engineering high school, and will be curious to see if that example is imitated in other parts of the United States.",1326481190

That would improve ordering if you have approximately equal load on each box.<p>- Isn't a 16 bit seq number overkill? Handing some of those bits to the unique ID would have made unique ID assignment easier. Duplicate MACs can and do exist (especially if you buy a lot of hardware from the same vendors).<p>- The quality of the ordering is going to be restricted by the quality of time synchronization within the cluster. Relying on NTP for this is OK, but experience suggests that a secondary monitoring system will be needed. Similarly, relying on monotonic time needs some care in system administration - care that could potentially be avoided with a different unique host ID assignment scheme.",1326480901

 Software engineers should be considered the people who go out and design a system, who are the primary create force and technical experts. Programmers should be people who implement.<p>Computer Scientists should be (mainly) scientists.<p>I see a lot of people who I have gone through school with enjoy the first 2 years where it's mostly practical work.

3461786,comment,3460945,3460945,55,0,YuriNiyazov,,,"I went to Stuyvesant HS 10 years ago, and I took all the CS classes that the school had offered from Mr. Zamansky (""Z"", as we affectionately call him), and can add some more specific information as to why this was necessary.<p>Stuyvesant opened in the beginning of the 20th century, and there are some vestigial components that should've been amputated long ago: in addition to the standard math, science, language (English and foreign), gym requirements, it has some requirements that truly made it historically a technical vocational school. To wit:
1 year of technical drafting (1 semester of drawing mechanical designs on paper, 1 semester of CAD), and 1.5 years of technical shop (1 semester of single-period shop, and 1 semester of double-period shop). By technical shop I mean the following: you get to choose two of ceramics, woodworking, metalworking (aka jewelry-making), electronics (aka computer tech), photography and video editing.<p>It's worth repeating: taking drafting and shop is <i>required</i> to graduate. By and large, these classes are not popular with students at all, the most obvious reason being ""why the hell do we <i>need</i> to know this outdated shit? If someone likes it, they can take it as an elective.""<p>Over the years, Z developed an ass-kicking CS curriculum: Intro to CS, AP CS (1 year), Systems/Network Programming, Graphics, and Independent Research. They are extraordinarily popular with the students, partially because Z is a great teacher, and partially because of the support of the previous alumni who would regularly take junior and senior-level college classes in their freshman college year thanks to that curriculum.<p>It's worth pointing out that none of the CS classes qualify for any graduation requirement. If you take them, you are taking them on your own time because you are interested. Aside from the knowledge itself, there's no carrot, even though the rest of the world is pointedly indicating that we need more software engineers and less metalworkers.<p>Now, Z goes to the current school administration and says ""hey, can we add CS as an option to fulfill some graduation requirements?"" and for 10 years straight (not kidding) the response he was getting was a consistent ""GFY"". Welcome to the NYC public school bureaucracy and people defending their own turf. It's not even that he asked anything outrageous. He didn't say ""Hey, can we get rid of drafting and shop?"". He said ""Can we give our students more choice as to what is required to graduate?""<p>So, about two years ago Z decided to try a different avenue - working within the structure of Stuyvesant was not feasible, so he might as well go outside of it. Someone I know connected him to Fred Wilson, they chatted, and the rest is what you see in front of you. None of this would've happened if the Stuy HS administration had a few less heads up their asses.",1326480402

The scam, I think, was to transfer money from your bank to Dwolla, move it from Dwolla to TradeHill, buy Bitcoins, slightly launder the Bitcoins by transferring them to yourself in another account (with Tradehill or Mt Gox), and sell them.  You can do that all in a few hours, easily with thousands of dollars.<p>Then go to your bank and say that the Dwolla transaction was fraudulent.  Dwolla gets stiffed by the bank, and has no recourse.  So they started hitting TradeHill with chargebacks.  I think they did it before their Terms and Conditions said that they could do chargebacks.  (In fact, I think I remember reading somewhere that a feature of Dwolla vs. Paypal is that there would be no chargebacks.)  Now, I believe their Terms say that they can do chargebacks.<p>You may also have heard about how some people's Dwolla accounts were vulnerable when they used the same user name and password on Dwolla as they did on Mt Gox.  Mt Gox was hacked [3], and it was (supposedly) VERY easy for people to have their bank account cleaned out via Dwolla.  Since people link their bank accounts to Dwolla, if a thief gets their Dwolla password, then the thief can simply transfer money from the bank to Dwolla, and then from Dwolla to a Bitcoin exchange (like Mt Gox).  Then launder them as above, and you have yourself thousands of dollars.<p>I should note that it's likely possible for people to get their bank accounts emptied via PayPal as well (hence all the Paypal phishing attempts), but it's more difficult to launder Paypal credits, since you can't easily convert from a Paypal credit balance to cash like you can with Dwolla (thanks to Bitcoin).<p>But overall, I have a favorable opinion of Dwolla.<p>[1] <a href=""http://tradehillblog.com/2011/07/26/why-we-are-no-longer-accepting-dwolla/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tradehillblog.com/2011/07/26/why-we-are-no-longer-acc...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://tradehillblog.com/2011/07/25/tradehill-audit-discovers-dwolla-transactions-are-reversible/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tradehillblog.com/2011/07/25/tradehill-audit-discover...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://blog.zorinaq.com/?e=55"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.zorinaq.com/?e=55</a>",1326480246

When those two things overlap it can be amazing! When they do not it can be hard. When you have nothing to be passionate about it is sad. For example:<p>- I <i>love</i> kitesurfing. Since 13 I have been insanely passionate about it. Right now I am sat in a hostel in Cape Town coding away just giddy with the excitement about the waves and wind that are coming in tomorrow. I am hoping to get another jump this big tomorrow: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVDgV7cbNjU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVDgV7cbNjU</a>. However, <i>no one is going to pay me to kitesurf</i>. Even the best guys in the world do not make much money at all. I am always going to lose money kiting. I love it; but I cannot make enough money from it to have a family and give them the life my father gave me. Therefore trying to pursue kitesurfing as a means to happiness and economic stability would be a <i>terrible</i> idea.<p>- I <i>love</i> the internet. I love the apps, sites, hacks, businesses, connections, possibilities and promises of the internet. The economies of the world love the internet. That is a great overlap. I can always make money by coding no matter how bad things get. And I will enjoy it. I may find the clients tedious or the projects dull but I enjoy the process of writing code. It is fun and although I am not very good; it fulfils me intellectually, economically, and professionally.<p>- I <i>love</i> making stuff happen. The satisfaction I got from running my last business and see all my competitors copy my model was amazing. I loved managing my staff and reading happy customers' emails and everything that involved improving our software. These are things that I am deeply passionate about and are extremely economically valuable. I have found happiness through my passion for business.<p>Think of it like a ven diagram.

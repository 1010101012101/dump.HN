The issue is that, for irrational numbers, there is <i>never</i> a point at which you can stop and say &quot;okay, we know it is irrational now&quot;.<p>In fact, if we had an algorithm that could <i>always</i> tell us whether a sequence converged to a rational number, we could solve the Halting Problem:<p>For any Turing Machine you wish to check for halting-ness, produce a sequence S by successively appending a full encoding (any will do) of the Turing Machine state at every step to the decimal expansion of the previous value in S.  Apply your algorithm to S.  If S is irrational, then we know it never halts.  If S is rational, then we know it halts or repeats after a finite number of digits - so we can simply run it until it does one or the other (this may take arbitrarily long, and an arbitrarily large amount of storage, but <i>finitely</i> in both cases).",1443408794

If you raised the ceiling this would solve the problem.<p>Though you should note, SAT prep has a negligible effect on scores. Intelligence, sadly, is mostly the result of genetics and non-shared environment, with an emphases on genetics. Our inability to admit this would be hilarious if its results weren&#x27;t so tragic.<p>Raising the ceiling would also help with the Ivy-league&#x27;s insane penchant for passing on some of the most able students. Scott Aaronson had perfect SAT scores at 15 - this was back when the SAT was much harder. In his words:<p>I admit that my views on this matter might be colored by my strange (though as I’ve learned, not at all unique) experience, of getting rejected from almost every “top” college in the United States, and then, ten years later, getting recruited for faculty jobs by the very same institutions that had rejected me as a teenager [...] I was a narrow, linear, A-to-B thinker who lacked depth and emotional intelligence: the exact opposite of what Harvard and Princeton were looking for in every way.<p>With a higher ceiling, sufficiently high scores are impressive enough on their own. I don&#x27;t care about those institutions, it&#x27;s Princeton and Harvard&#x27;s loss. And Cornell&#x27;s gain! But it&#x27;s an insane way to do admissions and it has a real cost on kids.

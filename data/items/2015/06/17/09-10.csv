The modern world valorizes few things more than attention. It demands that we pay attention at school and at work; it punishes parents for being inattentive; it urges us to be mindful about money, food, and fitness; it celebrates people who command others’ attention. As individuals, we derive a great deal of meaning from the products of sustained attention and concentration—from the projects we’ve completed, the relationships we’ve maintained, the commitments we’ve upheld, the skills we’ve mastered. Life often seems to be “about” paying attention—and the general trend seems to be toward an ever more attentive way of life. Behind the crisis of distraction, in short, there is what amounts to a crisis of attention: the more valuable and in demand attention becomes, the more problematic even innocuous distractions seem to be.&quot;<p>and then this insight toward the end:<p>&quot;as I read Crawford’s solemn prescriptions for the elimination of distraction, it occurred to me that we might have everything backward. What if, in fact, we’re not very good at being distracted? What if we actually don’t value distraction enough? It may be that, with our mobile games and Twitter feeds and YouTube playlists, we’ve allowed distraction to become predictable and repetitive, manageable and organized, dull and boring—too much, in short, like work.&quot;",1434534322

He doesn&#x27;t have to tend to his Vine profile, he doesn&#x27;t have to accept the implicit delegation of tasks to him by email.<p>Particularly in the social media areas, the claimed obligation is really nothing more than vanity. It doesn&#x27;t matter in the slightest if I am popular on Instagram - to attempt such a thing would only be an exercise in self-gratification.<p>I also have a fundamental problem with claims of planned obsolescence (all of the devices that run last year&#x27;s Apple OS upgrades will run this year&#x27;s. Talk to some Apple engineers about how much time they spend trying to make things work for users on older devices - this is done not for evil reasons, it&#x27;s done because they care).<p>Looking back and panning the original iPhone as being crude and slow seems somewhat unfair given the vast increases in hardware performance that have happened since. Yes, the iPhone was pushing the hardware limits in 2007, and yes it was a primitive product compared to what we have now, but all phones back then were slow - the difference was that the others were ugly and ill-conceived, as well as being slow.<p>It seems very strange to me to claim that the <i>purpose</i> of the iPhone was to teach us how to accommodate treating a tiny device carefully. The only way to make a networked, general-purpose computer fit in your pocket, is to make it the size of your hand, which means it&#x27;s small, its components are small, its case is packed tight with hardware, and its input surface is small. If the author feels this can be fixed, he stands to make a considerable amount of money, presumably by inventing holographic UIs, or direct brain interfaces. Otherwise, I will continue to think that the <i>purpose</i> of the iPhone was to put a computer in my pocket. That it is fragile and needs to be used precisely, is a necessary compromise for its form factor.<p>Is it possible to unwittingly make yourself a slave to the technology? Of course, but it&#x27;s possible to unwittingly make yourself a slave to almost anything. I think that is the key failing of this piece, it seeks to place the technology at the centre of the argument, with Apple standing above us, herding us into digital stables. Instead, <i>we</i> are at the centre of the argument. <i>We</i> control how obligated we feel towards any ephemeral, abstract collection of bytes.<p>So, delete your Facebook profile and go for a hike.

AB testing is a great tool to verify hypotheses (and those may well be competing hypotheses), but I really question its usefulness as a creative tool.<p>If you can plausibly only do a couple of AB tests a year (the possibility of running an AB test being a function of traffic and time) you better not waste that opportunity on button colors or some similar nonsense.<p>Sure, evolution through natural selection produced some awesome designs and is basically a completely blind process based purely on testing of different variants with only slight and random differences with no involvement of any designer at all (sound familiar?) – but it also took billions of years. Most designers just don’t have that kind of time …<p>To more directly answer your question, AB tests can certainly be used to defend against bad hypotheses. If there is a culture of testing and new designs have to be battle tested then that’s less of an opportunity for someone in a position of power to screw things up by fiat. However, that’s also a tremendous waste of time and efficiency if bad designs that could be sieved out quickly by simple heuristics have to also first be tested, which is just a slow process and a wasted opportunity to test something better.<p>Maybe think of AB testing as a last line of defense, but be careful, AB tests can be paralyzing. (Or rather, first AB tests paralyze everything, then the boss is annoyed by how slow everything is going and changes everything by fiat and immediately without any testing at all. From one extreme to the other …)",1434533746

The electron signal emitted by the surface of the objects in the chamber doesn&#x27;t behave like light bouncing off an object&#x27;s surface. Normally shadows are cast by photons traveling in straight lines, and our minds have become accustomed to this behavior.  The electrons in the SEM can travel in curved paths, so the illumination in the SEM image can effectively go around corners, leading to surreal shadows and highlights.<p>The aperture size in the SEM is <i>much</i> smaller than that used in a camera or microscope, leading to much higher depth of field for a given geometry and working distance.  A camera might be f/16, while this SEM is effectively f/200<p>The brightness of objects in the image is partially influenced by the material properties and local geometry, so an exposed protrusion or edge will tend to be very bright -- something that doesn&#x27;t happen with macro photography.<p>Hey, it&#x27;s fun to play with scanning electron microscopes.",1434531698

Not simplifying complex queries through views</i><p>Number 6 needs to be used with discretion.<p>When you reference a complex view, you are in essence making use of a stored query snippet -- there is no magic to the view, and unless you've materialized it (which is very rare), there is no efficiency advantage. All it really is is code sharing.<p>So what's the problem then?<p>The problem then is that the query analyzer has to assume that you actually care about every element of said view, every returned column, every spurious join. I've dealt with too many performance problems where people made use of an overly generous view that invalidated most indexes, removed the potential for covering indexes (the #1 most important performance element of a database), and did a lot of joins that were irrelevant to the usage.",1292252306

2000591,comment,2000394,2000394,0,0,tibbon,,,"YES!<p>We should approach this from a two-tiered testing platform.<p>The first tier is rather like how you'd do it in Rails or any other TDD environment.<p>We write a list of tests that we know should pass as true at the end. Let's say, start with the US and State constitutions as the basis.<p><pre><code>    def must_not_prohibit_exercise_of_religion()
    {
        People.can_exercise_religion?
    }

</code></pre>
We then write in the test laws and see what side effects occur. When those side effects occur, we must make note of them and consider the potential exceptions.<p><pre><code>    def freedom_of_speech()
    {
        unless(crowded_theatre && People.speak == fire)
            People.can_speak?
        end
    }
</code></pre>
As a second layer then we must test it on smaller populations to determine the effects. This has worked wonderfully in some situations. ""Gay Marriage will destroy marriage and society"" is a claim I've heard prior. So test it in Massachusetts. Several years later, no marriages on record have been destroyed due to gay marriage, and the metrics of society's stability have not moved significantly in any direction that we can attribute to same-sex marriage. So it (should) pass and become law nationally because we've observed its effects. We can observe similar for the long term effects of required health insurance in Massachusetts as we debate how things should work out nationally.<p>Just as we have 'human-readable code' why shouldn't our laws be machine readable? Computers can remember/understand 200+ years of case law probably better than humans. Again, this is something that we could test.<p>One of my friends is working on a law firm run by computers (<a href=""http://www.robotandhwang.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.robotandhwang.com/</a>). Of course the machines can't show up in court or legally offer advice, but they can advise the attorney.

2000590,comment,1999922,2000433,0,0,cgbystrom,,,"An ordinary Comet server with long-poll can actually end up eating quite some CPU.<p>I run beaconpush.com which is a cloud-based service for browser push messages. We're based on Netty and Java, which works out well for us. We've looked at Erlang and wrote some initial prototypes in it but Java became our language of choice. Mainly because we knew it and had some experiences with Netty, a NIO library for Java. Netty did also outperform Erlang and mochiweb (both vanilla configured).<p>Anyway, the problem tend to be with long-poll that users re-establish their connection back to the servers each time they receive a message or navigate to another page (or reload the page).
This end up taking a big toll on the system. We're to some extent limited to how fast we can perform accept() on our sockets.<p>If you use long-polling with multi-part you can get away with sending more messages on a single established connection (it becomes request/response/response/response or similar). That can reduce the system load and the use of WebSockets can eliminate the use of reconnections altogether (disregarding any page reloads).<p>Facebook's use of AJAX navigation (i.e not reloading the entire page when user clicks on links etc) also reduces this load. This due to not having to re-establish a connection each time a user reloads a page.<p>So yes, we're actually CPU bound by the accept() behavior (at least to how the JVM does accept()). But would our connection be more permanent in nature then no, we would of course be more I/O bound if not completely.",1292251736

For starters, they are an IT services company so it was difficult to implement from the get-go when you are dependant on your employees being billable.  We were hoping to build software products, and we knew that we would need to provide support and incentives b/c we were essentially asking those involved to work hours outside of their normal schedule.  We set up a fairly streamlined, gated process which provided the teams the ability to receive mentorship throughout each gate. They would formalize an idea/concept, then run it by the CEO and sales team to ensure it had buy-in and would be marketable to our established customer base. If at any point it wasn't viable they could either pivot or stop.  The wheels quickly fell off when the CEO (after signing off on it) decided it was too heavy handed, then the sales team was too busy to meet with any of the teams, and none of the teams could see the incentive to working on something that lacked support and required them to work off-hours to build.

I've found that many people don't really fully understand the ramifications though. Even if some of these places only have 3-5 developers working on this full time - that's still probably FAR more resources than another company, especially a startup, can devote to the problem.

It is sometimes inflexible.</i><p>Swap ""free"" for ""proprietary"" in that quote, and the statement is no less true. (Voice of experience, here) Continuing:<p><i>If people take the arguments in favor of open source seriously, they must explain why open source has not lived up to its ""promise"" and conclude that proprietary tools would be a better choice.</i><p>No, they need not. If even a handful of free or open source software meets the standards of quality one sets for proprietary software -- and I would argue not only that such a handful exists, but the so-called ""standards"" must be rather low to pass some of the proprietary software I've dealt with -- then open source has indeed kept its promise. Nor does the existence of some ""bad"" open source software imply that proprietary is better. If that were the case, we must also accept the reverse, that the existence of some ""bad"" proprietary software implies open source is better. Examples exist in <i>both</i> categories, so clearly <i>each</i> is better than the other.<p>Here's the deal: An open source package, once ""in the wild"", can become <i>very</i> hard to kill if it gains any traction to speak of. As long as someone keeps the source available, anyone else can not only acquire and use it, but build on and improve it. Not so, proprietary. With the source kept to the strict confines of a few personal or company machines, its growth and development are limited to what its owners see fit to pursue or permit, and they can choke it off at any time. As a consequence, we tend to see more ""bad"" open software roaming the net as abandoned projects are left to anyone who cares to pick them up, while proprietary packages that either don't make the grade or lose their luster meet a quiet demise behind closed doors. That's what makes proprietary software look better: the ""bad"" stuff just gets killed off more effectively.",1292251005

2000527,comment,2000394,2000394,0,0,Goladus,,,"I don't think you could test taxation, for a number of reasons.<p>First, you don't have time to measure the effects of funding changes.  How do people behave with the new services funded by the taxes, when you aren't collecting enough to provide them anyway?  Does the government go bankrupt?  No, because revenue was not changed significantly due to the small size of the test.<p>Second, sample populations are unlikely to exhibit the same behavioral traits of large-scale populations.  For example, if you applied a tax increase to a limited segment of the population the first behavior change you would see is that people would try to escape the test group.<p>For something like a sales tax this is even more obvious.  The overall rate of taxation matters much less than the rate relative to a competitor.  It's a free competitive advantage and of course behavior will change-- the untaxed businesses will be more likely to thrive and grow while driving their competitors bankrupt.  When everyone has the same tax rate they have to find real market advantages.<p>The whole point of taxes is that they are applied universally as much as possible.  Everyone contributes a little bit so that the society can have things that benefit everyone but the market is unlikely to ever provide.  NPR just discussed autopsies as an example of this.  Understanding why people die is good for the public, yet only the most altruistic individuals are inclined to pay for an autopsy of their own loved ones.<p>While I suppose it is possible to design test runs of tax laws, I doubt it will ever be as simple as picking a ""representative sample of 10,000.""  There are probably only certain kinds of laws that can be tested, and tax laws probably aren't among them.",1292250508

Some might say it is better to be hallucinating while running about the real world, but I prefer the ability to instantly wake up out of a 'bad trip'.",1247921915
711712,comment,709733,711509,0,0,Goladus,,,"I disagree.  Former classmates often share quite a bit.  There's likely a slightly greater level of trust and accountability than with a total stranger, and there's a good chance it'll be easy to find a topic of conversation to start with.  I also know that I, personally, would be more likely to do a small favor for a former classmate than a complete stranger.  For example, if I knew via facebook that one of my former classmates was an Erlang programmer, and one of my other friends was looking to hire one, I might try and hook them up.  I wouldn't bother to go looking for random stranger Erlang programmers.<p>Being former classmates isn't like being close family, but it doesn't mean absolutely nothing either.  It's a minor but significant reason why you might want to connect with someone using facebook.  A similar minor but significant reason might be that you just met at a party last week and seemed to get along really well.<p>And again, the point is that there's usually nothing to get creeped out about.  If you'd rather focus on new friends and forget old ones that's fine, but an old connection isn't absolutely nothing.<p>Incidentally, I consider the word ""creepy"" to have more of a threatening connotation than simply annoying and unpleasant.  An old, dark, abandoned house is creepy, you don't know what's inside and it might be threatening.  A guy is creepy when he doesn't know a girl but stares at her for 20 minutes at the bar then follows her home.  Reconnecting with old classmates who have fallen out of touch is not creepy, at least not by default.",1247921892

I can't really think of any revolutionary breakthroughs in software for the last 20 years.<p>As you point out that doesn't mean that progress hasn't been made, and we haven't been walking further down the road of enlightenment. It's just that we've been taking one step at a time down a straight road without many surprises.",1247921882

711704,comment,711585,711589,0,0,tedunangst,,,"You only need to be able to calculate what a user has done when the user views the comment.  You can imagine storing each vote as a hash of (voter, comment, direction).  Then when rendering the page, you calculate all possible hashes on the page and look for hits.  If the comment count per page isn't too large, it won't take that long.  It's fairly intensive and probably not worth it for a site like this, but possible.  It would also screw up any offline voting-rings detection.<p>Edit: should have clarified that by user I meant a hash of name and password, so it's infeasible to calculate offline.",1247921175

711701,comment,711561,711667,0,0,noss,,,"There has been progress in SE though, the world is asking for more software and larger more complex systems to be written.<p>The progress in software engineering seems to be in finding good practices and giving them names, when they have names one can write papers about them where their usage in actual projects is analysed.<p>Example: there was a time when object orientation had not been coined as a term. Now that we have it we can move to the next step and explore variations on it. We can teach it, we can make languages adapted for it.<p>(I'm not holding up object orientation itself as an example of progress here (or the opposite), but the concept of giving a practice a name and exploring it.)<p>It's a great advantage if one can talk about 'unit tests' and a new hired person knows about it. People were writing what qualified as unit tests before the name existed, but now that we have a name we can write books about it, discuss problems in doing it, etc.<p>I'm sure bridge building and other engineering efforts have had much of the same development in their infancy. Clever individuals were doing successful things without thinking much about it they worked what they had, others needed to talk about it and books were written... and now we know arch bridges, suspension bridges.",1247920751

It only seems to be down-voting. And sometimes on the second vote it actually drops <i>two</i> points.<p>Anyone else notice things like that?<p>Or maybe I'm going crazy.",1247920386

711696,comment,711561,711648,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I don't think there is any indication whatsoever that programming the equivalent of a Turing machine will become any more ""illustrative"" than it has ever been. 20 years back we had buzzwords like ""query by example"" and we (almost) had VisualBasic.<p>What has changed since then? Certainly not much in terms of programming productivity. What has changed is that we program the web now instead of a PC or a Mainframe. The architecture has changed. Esthetics have changed. Collaboration has changed. And we can crunch a lot more numbers now. Programming hasn't changed much.<p>And I think it won't change in the next 20 years unless some hard AI problems can be solved.",1247920096

711691,comment,711561,711561,0,0,GeneralMaximus,,,"Well, I expect that most programming language research in the next 10 years would focus on exploiting multicore programming. If we're lucky, we'll all be using something like Haskell or Erlang, and all apps will be multithreaded. Languages that choose to ignore multicore will slowly suffocate. Writing multithreaded apps will become much easier than it is now, if not trivial.<p>It's not wrong to dream, is it? :)",1247919229

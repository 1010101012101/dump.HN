4549179,comment,4548539,4548539,6,0,leothekim,,,"I think that, though computer science has permeated a number of different fields, its core study remains more relevant than ever. There are important theoretical problems in CS and so much more potential to be unlocked in other fields s.t. the core study remains necessary to understand how it can be better applied.<p>Also, there are areas in computer science that wouldn't be 100% applicable to, say, bioinformatics (e.g. cryptography) but may be very applicable in a much more generalized sense. I don't think we've delved into computer science for long enough that its study can be relegated and subjugated within other fields. That it is taught alongside courses in other fields speaks more to its practicality than its diminishing relevance as a standalone field.",1348156777

4549177,comment,4548583,4548583,14,0,creamyhorror,,,"This seems wonderful. It's exactly the sort of practical solution that could really make a big dent in the patent problem, and to see it actually come into being with the cooperation of the USPTO and Google Patent Search is very, very heartening.<p>I hope folks here will take time to read this new site from time to time and raise any particularly problematic patent applications to their circles. There's the risk of reading a patent and then potentially being made liable for trebled damages, but hopefully any ridiculous patents will get filtered out by this system, reducing the risk of violation in the first place.<p>I see a two-tier system emerging: a group of ""frontline"" patent reviewers reading AskPatents regularly, and a wider group of people interested in patents within an industry. If only the really problematic patents are brought to the attention of the wider group, they won't have to worry so much about liability for trebled damages. The ""frontline"" people reading new submissions on AskPatents and trumpeting out the basket cases - they'll be the ones taking on the trebled-damages risk. I hope there'll be some among us who can play this role. (It'll probably end up being interested hobbyists or the patent-hunting departments of large corporations.)<p>edit: I wonder if there's any mechanism for discussion of <i>approved</i> patents? This might provide the seed material for patent reexamination, which in turn allows for patent invalidation. If people review approved patents and start offering prior art for some, any patent trolls intending to wield those patents might start having second thoughts, because it'll look like those patents are on shaky legal ground. This way, even after being granted, questionable patents could still be cast into doubt. Maybe I'm overoptimistic, but how far could Spolsky/the PTO push this?<p>edit2: Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks like there's no ""patent application stream"" on AskPatents, so it's basically a bog-standard discussion board for patents right now. It might be more handy if it had an integrated feed from the patent application database (no need for an API, even an RSS feed would work).",1348156758

4549173,comment,4547925,4547925,4,0,jread,,,"You have to careful comparing one specific EC2 instance with other providers. Unlike most compute services, EC2 infrastructure is heterogenous. The c1.xlarge instance compared might deploy to 2 or 3 different chipsets in us-east-1, each with different performance characteristics. Based on the results they posted, this instance appears to have deployed to a 2.13GHz E5506 host. Most likely, Brightbox is using a homogenous infrastructure, and likely something a bit faster, like X55, X56 or E5s. For a more apples to apples comparison, they might have tested against an m2.4xlarge (8 cores) or cc1.4xlarge (8 cores hyperthreaded to 16), which are also 8 cores and deploy to X5550, X5570 or E5-2665. Based on my own benchmarking either of these instances would have performed comparably or better than the Brightbox 8GB instance.<p>The point is, you have a lot of options with EC2 in terms of performance, and comparing a single instance deployment doesn't really do it justice.<p>[Edit]
Here are a few links to Phoronix results for EC2 instance types not included in their testing. m2s, cc1s and cc2s are the better CPU performers in EC2 due to faster processors.

Furthermore, it may not even be optimal. The basis of this change is individualized education. Yet how can we teach students individually when there are millions of kids that have to be taught? Where are the teachers to facilitate this form of delivery? Who will pay for the increased cost in education? How will we even classify children? It has been demonstrated that children do better in school when they are placed in higher performing groups. Should we put all of the underperforming kids in a class where they see no one superior to them? Finally, I think there is a certain set of knowledge that everyone should know and K-12 does a decent job of teaching that.

In the absence open access and public data, rumors and fear have reigned supreme. During provisional research on the censorship regime of the government, we found initial indicators that telecommunications entities in Iran have leveraged private address spaces to build a mature information network only reachable within the country. Despite the clear political implications of the claim we put forward, particularly in light of rampant speculation regarding the mandate of Article 46 of the Fifth Five Year Development Plan to establish a ``national information network,'' we hestitate to engage in speculation regarding the purpose of this structure. Rather, in order to solicit critical feedback for future research, we outline our initial findings and attempt to demonstrate that the matter under contention is a nation-wide phenomenom that warrants broader attention.""<p>So essentially, my argument is that the widescale routing of 10/8 subnets across domestic networks, coupled with domains pointed to these addresses, warrants serious attention.",1348155243

I went grew up in the shadows of NASA and my schools were all excellent -- my teachers all had masters degrees in what they were teaching, they loved their job, and they were well compensated for it. The issue is one of this achievement gap between the well funded suburban schools (my HS marching band had a budget ~500k/yr) and impoverished schools (both inner city and elsewhere). For those on the other end of the achievement gap, having a standard set that roughly equates to what is required to be an educated member of society seems entirely appropriate. Keep in mind that standards, at least in my experience, don't fetter education. For example, when I was in school, it was generally understood that if you were in calculus as a junior, you could probably pass your algebra I based exit exams so we spent our time on calculus.<p>Also, keep in mind that school is intended to teach you more than just history, math, etc. This is also where we learn to socialize. I guarantee you that my introverted self wouldn't have kissed a girl as early as I did if I wasn't forced to socialize with people for 170 school days a year. I learned how to make friends and how to balance my need for solitude with deeply fulfilling relationships -- something that would have taken much longer has I not been in school.<p>This isn't to say that my experience is biased towards the upper end of the achievement gap. In fact, while I'm in grad school in Boston, I'm volunteering at a charter school in its inner city and trust me, there are many problems with inner city education but the least of which is standardized testing. Traumatic home lives, poor materials, no cultural understanding of the value of education, etc represent far larger hurdles.<p>Indeed, I believe we should quibble about the standards and have a national discussion about what an educated member of society should know instead of debating the value of a standard at all. I believe that these standard have gone too far (plumbers probably don't need calculus, for example) but having a base-line of education is never a bad thing.",1348155117

Having built maps for the past 12 years, I know exactly what of each of those issues are about. The blurry images are underlying base layers that drew first and then probably the upper layer timed out when rendering the tile. The curves are caused by elevation measurements that are incorrect (measuring elevation from a satellite involves bouncing from the ground - when there are structures below, depending on the material, it may go through or bounce differently) or precision problems when generating the elevation grid (very common). The big white thing are clouds, when you buy highly expensive imagery you get them with louds (say 30% cloud blockage) and you need to comnine several images taken a different times, color correct them, and stitch them back to remove it (try to do this for one city and then think about doing it for the entire world). The routes that don't match the pins is weird, but it could be that the snapping point for the routing engine snapped to the wrong street edge (it seems very far though) or that the geocoder and the routing engine use different geocoders (that would be bad). Creating a good mapping product is difficult, but Apple will have something much better in one year.",1348154617

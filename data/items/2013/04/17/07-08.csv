5563289,comment,5562442,5562804,9,0,belorn,,,"Conflict of interest is one reason, but there are others. The process that PTO use, is one based on 19th century condition.<p>19th century administrative standards is very simple and got bright lines; they dont require a great deal of expensive investigation. The assumption of the 19th century patent system is that everything that should be patented already is patented already.<p>Like other 19th century administrative structures, the patent office assumes that all it can be expected to do is to look in its own files and to make rough binary determination - 0 or 1, novel or obvious or not - on the basis of the consultation of its own administrative record.<p>This mean that PTO's job is to only answer questions based on its own records. A invention is novel if the clerk can't find a similar invention in the office. A invention is non-obvious, if the clerk do not consider the invention to be a natural extension of any existing files.<p>PTO stills live in that system while everything else has evolved forward during the 200 years that has passed, including what type inventions that are patentable. This mean that a large number of invention never got filed when they got discovered. If a patent application then get sent in several decades later, the result is simple. The patent office grants the patent because the invention is not in the archive.<p>This is crazy. We should not use 19th century administrative process in the 21st. We should not assume that government knows everything, or that their records can stretch over inventions when such inventions was unpatentable. Doing 20 years governmental intervention into the market should be a serious undertaking where the government are responsible if such intervention cause serious harm or is done faulty.",1366185586

5563218,comment,5562156,5562571,7,0,Houshalter,,,"There is a similar argument against AI. That a computer can't ""feel"" or experience any of the sensations we do. If you type 'emotional_state = ""happy""', does that mean your computer feels happiness? Even if you have a complex simulation of neurons, if you zoom in, all you will see is little electrons bouncing through various logic gates and ending up in some kind of pattern.<p>But the thing is, <i>the exact same thing is true for your brain too</i>! If you zoom in on your brain you will find nothing more than electrical impulses and neurons that strengthen or weaken their connection to other neurons. If the neurons were suddenly replaced with little computers that performed exactly the same, you wouldn't feel any different. You would still experience emotions and feel sensations and have no idea any parts had been swapped under the hood, unless you looked.<p>I don't know why but this idea is confusing to me. This XKCD <a href=""http://xkcd.com/505/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/505/</a> is a good example. My consciousness could be a bunch of static rocks and a man placing new rows based on simple rules. I find this thought disturbing, but there isn't anything fundamentally different between that, a computer simulation, and a world of a bunch of atoms hitting each other, following simple physical laws.<p>Different beings could exist in all three universes. And each would feel emotions and sensations and all that. And each would argue about how beings just like them in the other universes ""don't really exist"" like they do.<p>So how is this different from a character in a novel or a variable in a computer set to ""happy""? I honestly don't know. The character in a book is completely static. Whatever is written in the pages, it isn't changing, it isn't taking input and producing output. But the rows of rocks are static too after all. They don't take any input from the outside world either. They change over a dimension of space, each new row one foot to the right of the last. As do the characters in a book. Each paragraph moves the characters forward through their own dimension of time. Maybe the process that creates the rows of rocks, the man following simple rules, is what makes it conscious. But the book is created by a writer following a process too, does that make it conscious?<p>The only thing I can think of is that the character in the book is far simpler than a human. Words that say ""john is happy"" is similar to setting a variable on your computer equal to ""happy"". Happiness in a human is far more complex, involving tons of interactions between neurons. But this answer isn't satisfactory to me. Complexity isn't what makes something intelligent or conscious after all.",1366184042

5563216,comment,5561461,5562489,2,0,spc476,,,"As someone who lives in South Florida (east coast, Jupiter southward), I can state that the only toll roads in the area that also have service plazas are the Florida Turnpike (north/south and can be used for commuting) and I-75 west of US-27 (runs east/west across the state, and at the point it becomes a toll road, you are basically heading away from the population center towards the middle of the state; also, practically no one lives west of US-27 until you get to the west coast of Florida).  The other toll roads (Sawgrass Expressway, 924, Dolphin Expressway, parts of I-95 in Miami, Don Shula Expressway and I think 826 (it's been awhile since I driven that one)) are all very short (longest is the Sawgrass Expressway, at 20 miles) and all in a very dense urban setting and absolutely no service plazas.<p>Also, all the toll roads in South Florida use the same electronic system (EZ-Pass); it's also usable up through Orlando (from personal experience).  With such a system, there's no need to even slow down to pay the toll (and there are no more toll booths in Miami; if you have no EZ-Pass system, a photo of your license place is taken, and a bill (not a ticket) is mailed to the license holder).<p>Edit:  There are also three service plazas along the Florida Turnpike in South Florida, one in Dade County (Miami), one in Broward County (just north of Ft. Lauderdale) and one in West Palm Beach (towards the north end of the county), each separated by approximately 30 miles.

If there are involuntarily unemployed (we would add underemployed) people it means the deficit is too low. The government should either cut taxes or increase spending. It is certainly debatable which one is a better policy, but thats beyond the scope of this paper. When is the deficit too large? When its over 3%, 7%, 10%? Again, there is no magic number and anyone who comes up with a universal number simply misunderstands the modern monetary regime and macroeconomics. In opposition to magic, Lerner proposed functional financethe notion that the federal governments budgetary outcome is of no consequence by itself, but rather, what is important is the economic effects of government spending and taxing. When total spending in the economy, including government spending, is more than what the economy is able to produce when employed at full capacity, the government should either lower its spending or raise taxes. A failure to do so will lead to inflation. So inflation is the true limit to government spending not lack of financing. Government debt is merely the result of government deficit and hence the same applies to debt as well.""",1366182891

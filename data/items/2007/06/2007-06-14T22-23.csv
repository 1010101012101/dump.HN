You've got more control if you hand  out js code (think adsense), but a lot more sites are going to accept your code if you hand out the html for a flash object (think youtube). You should be open to multiple versions.  <p>You might take a look at a widget directory service like widgetbox (<a href=""http://www.widgetbox.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.widgetbox.com/</a> ). They try and take care of some of this, but if you use them or not you're still going to want to know what works where and why. <p>Get ready to sign up for lots of accounts and test your widget everywhere.

Are you going through all the legal red tap to make sure everything is by the book and how complicated has that process been to start taking is money. One thing that has kept us from accepting small investments is the legal tape surrounding additional bookkeeping. ",1181858787

I've talked to a number of so called internet biz dev ""pros"" and they actually advocate outsourcing site development to offshore places and concentrate on marketing. I was like, WTF? Now i know why the successful web startups all originate from hackers. These internet biz dev ""pros"" just don't get it<p>The most uncomfortable thing is that my non-techie co-founder actually agrees with this thought. Maybe it's time for me to find another cofounder.<p>You can really tell the diff between an outsourced site and a non-outsourced site. An outsourced site will most likely be .aspx (India's fav), have a rigid design/structure. Eg. <a href=""http://scriptovia.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scriptovia.com</a><p>An in-house version usually has its own unique design/identity Eg. scribd.com",1181858443

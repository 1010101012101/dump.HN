The third problem was small changes in synchrony between A and B, due to a pseudorandom dropping of 2 ms chunks of data on either side. Over the course of a 10 minute conversation, these could accumulate to a differential of 30 or 40 msec between sides--enough to change a cross-channel echo from inaudible to audible, for example, or from barely audible to very noticeable, for a human listener.<p>When this bug was finally run down, it turned out to be a piece of code in the utility which extracts conversations ('messages') from the Robotoperator message master file. The code performed a check at each data block boundary to see if the first two bytes had the values 'FF FF'; if so, these were interpreted as header information, and the 16 bytes beginning with ""FF FF"" were discarded as not part of the speech data. This code was a relic from an earlier version of the Robotoperator which did not deal with mu-law values, and thus never encountered FF in data. In mu-law data, FF is one of two ways of representing zero signal level ('minus zero'). The offending lines of code were removed and the problem ceased.""",1303954118

Interestingly, the News and Views opens with the same profound point (that the unit of sleep appears to be <i>single neurons</i>) that you referred to in your post. My point is only to note that the Nature folks address in the first line what it took the Ars reporter an entire article to get at.<p>Nature News and Views: <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v472/n7344/full/472427a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v472/n7344/full/472427a...</a><p>Nature News:

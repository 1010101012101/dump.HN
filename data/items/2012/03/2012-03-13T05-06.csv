You aren't the only one to value quality of life over quantity; in fact everyone else does too.  The only problem is that if you're very poor you don't have a choice.  Wherever and whenever the human race manages to claw its way out of poverty, we immediately stop having so many kids.  It's not magic.<p>That being said...<p>1) What upcoming food shortage?  Food production is largely a solved problem.  We know how to sustainably produce large amounts of food from a given amount of arable land, and we have plenty of arable land to feed not just the current global population, but the projected maximum global population.  It's true!  We already have the ability to feed the largest population we'll ever have.  True, Africa <i>currently</i> has food shortages, but as soon as Africa stops relying on peasant farming, that problem goes away.  We can argue about when (or if) Africa is going to finally have their own Green Revolution[0], but...upcoming shortages?  Do you know something the rest of us don't?  :)<p>2) I might ask what upcoming resource shortage, but that's a more complicated question, and probably not worth arguing about.  Still, you might want to consider the outcome of the Simon-Erlich wager[1], look at commodity price trends over the last couple decade, and then look at futures prices.  Would you take Erlich's side in a repeat of the original wager?  I wouldn't, and it's worth noting that Erlich and his ideological allies have repeatedly refused to do so.  Again, what do you know that they don't?<p>3) Also, this is wonderful news for ""investors"" too (why beat around the bush?  Call them ""capitalists""; you know you want to...).  Trust me, the slavering capitalist dogs are <i>VASTLY</i> more interested in having a rich China full of consumers than in having a poor China full of workers.  It might be nice to have cheap Chinese labour making iPods to sell to 300m rich Americans, but it will be <i>FANTASTIC</i> to have cheap robot labour making iPods to sell to 1.3b rich Chinese.  (And that's precisely the scenario you're envisioning.)  Lower costs and higher sales is how capitalists make their money in the real world.<p>4) Finally, it remains to be seen how good it will be environmentally.  In the short run (say, the next 50 years), it probably won't be.  Much as with population growth, we see an inverted curve.  Very poor countries can't afford to pollute, and very rich ones can afford not to - but right in the middle you end up polluting a bunch.  We went through that period in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; now it's China's turn.  They're producing less pollution for every dollar of GDP each year, but their GDP is climbing much faster. The environment is likely to get worse before it gets better.  (Of course, look on the bright side:  We are conquering global inequality, and the environment will recover eventually.  Those are both GREAT.  But let's not get carried away.)<p>[0]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon%E2%80%93Ehrlich_wager"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon%E2%80%93Ehrlich_wager</a>",1331618295

As compared to ""These are people too lazy to work for themselves and sustain themselves on the handouts of others"" argument we hear constantly from conservative camps.<p>Neither argument hold a lot of water, and in the end the homeless are considerably more complicated than either simplistic argument would suggest. Both arguments are deeply unfair to our society and the homeless, as it ignores the primary issues surrounding homelessness in exchange for simplistic feel-good fuzzies.<p>You've conveniently ignored the big, giant, planet-sized elephant in the room: substance abuse and mental health in regards to homelessness. Without addressing this it is impossible to know what side of the line this homesless-wireless-tower thing finds itself. There is a large (I'd argue vast majority) of the homeless demographic where this would be absolutely exploitative, and there is a much smaller demographic where this may actually be helpful. Without knowing more details about how this was executed, it's impossible to say what's what.<p>> <i>""where they were yesterday when those homeless people didn't get $20.""</i><p>Perhaps, giving $20 to an aid organization.<p>Directly funding the homeless is an issue that we can argue about till the cows come home and never come remotely close to consensus. Suffice it to say, there are many, many, legitimate concerns about its efficacy, and the money can be just as destructive as it can be rehabilitative.<p>There is also the notion of whether or not rehabilitation should be a goal when it comes to homelessness.<p>...

The Indian dairy industry is contributing significantly to the country's economy,besides improving the health standard by increasing the nutritional value of the food.<p>At 100 million tons of milk production, India is the highest milk producing country in the world. Almost half of milk produced in the country is consumed as raw milk and the rest converted into different dairy products.Since the processed dairy products lacks quality standards and hygiene value, country is unable to export dairy products in large measures. Therefore Indian Dairy industry is looking at Bulk Milk Coolers to reduce the temperature of the milk for minimizing growth of bacteria which in turn would improve shelf life of the milk.<p>When Milk is extracted,it is at around 37 Degrees C.It milk continues to remain at room temperature after extraction, bacterial growth will affect the quality of the milk.Only rapidly cooling milk immediately after extraction to a temperature of around 4 Degrees C and maintaining it at this temperature minimizes further micro-organism growth.Thereby ensuring that milk remains as fresh as it was when extracted.<p>Bulk Milk Coolers is used to reduce the temperature of the milk for inimizing growth of bacteria which in turn would improve shelf life of the milk.These coolers rapidly cool milk and also ensure that the quality of milk remains high and keeps milk fresh.<p>In India,NABARD is also offers financial assistance to Indian dairy industry and dairy owners for purchase of bulk milk coolers,which is an added advantage and reason to buy BMCU.<p>Objectives of having Bulk Milk Cooling Units:<p>1.To enhance the keeping quality of milk and also to avoid economic losses to farmers due to spillage/sourage of milk.
2.To produce improved quality products for export as well as to meet the domestic requirements.
3.To reduce the transportation cost by regulating transportation of the milk on alternative days and also through reduction in expenditure on purchase and maintenance of cans.<p>Thus,BMCUs provides a viable option for reducing the transportation cost as also maintaining the milk quality.<p>Beneficiaries of Bulk Milk Cooling Units (BMCUs) are Milk collection Agents,Village Milk Cooperative Societies of Cooperative Milk Union or Milk Collection Centers of private Dairies.<p>The operations involve collection and chilling of milk to a temperature of 4 Degrees C.<p>Advantages of using stainless steel Bulk Milk Cooler or Milk Chillers in modern dairy industry:<p>1.Elimination of souring/curdling of milk because of cooling at the collection center itself.
2.Adulteration of milk and spillage from cans can be eliminated during transport.
3.Transportation cost of milk can be brought down by regulating transportation to the main dairy either on alternative days or once in a day.
4.Saving of initial investment on purchase of cans and subsequent maintenance cost (Repairs, cleaning etc.) of those cans.
5.Improved quality of milk can be supplied to the main dairy to manufacture quality products for domestic as well as export markets.
6.Flexibility in milk collection time results in increase in volume of milk collected at the centers.
7.Farmers will get better returns for the quality of milk.
8.Chilling at the Main dairy can be avoided.<p>Economics of buying Bulk Milk Coolers:<p>Based on the various techno commercial parameters,the economics of the purchase of new Bulk Milk Coolers is very positive. The items of income include reduction in souring/curdling of milk, spillage and pilferage of milk, saving of expenditure on transportation, purchase and maintenance of cans and chilling cost received from the union while the expenditure includes the operational cost of cooler (fuel/power), repairs, maintenance and additional manpower.<p>Krishna Industries,manufacturer of SS Dairy equipments,offers Bulk milk coolers.There Bulk Milk Cooling Units are Dependable and durable,you can count on years of trouble-free performance, the lowest operating costs,precise temperature control,and a wide range of standard features and options.They specialize in milk cooling and storage systems.<p>Krishna Industries is Leading ISO 9001:2000 Certified manufacturer and exporter of Dairy equipments ,Stainless Steel Milk Cans,Milking Machines,Milk Buckets, Milk Pails, Stainless Steel Milk Cans, Stainless Steel Milk Collection accessories,Bulk Milk Collers.They offer state of the art products in the ever expanding field of Dairy Equipments.They thrive to deliver the highest quality of products that meets the international standards.<p>You can contact them at:<p>Krishna Industries<p>http://www.dairyequipments.com

If a device is meant to be used at half the ""arm's length"" distance (14 in), the reference pixel on that device would be only half as large. If a device is meant to be used at 3x times the distance (84 in), the reference pixel would be 3x larger. Much easier than angular diameters.",1331616698

3697155,comment,3696474,3696997,5,0,frisco,,,"Yes it does.  A priori, P(""freeeedom"") << P(""freedom"").  This decreases the probability that an attacker will stumble across your passphrase using anything other than a pure brute-force approach (more on that below).  Further, though not completely what you're talking about, English has huge amounts (~50%) of redundancy in its structure.  It's a tremendously easier problem to attack the passphrases with knowledge of the statistical structure of English, if that's actually a good assumption to make.  For example, the prior probability of an unknown word in a sentence being ""freedom"" is X, but when you know that the three preceding words are, ""I went seeking"", the probability of the unknown word being ""freedom"" becomes Y > X. Beyond misspellings, reordering words (say, German-style verb inversion) might also be effective in thwarting this compression while still being easy to remember. [1]<p>If you want to brute force your way through, sure, there's no difference in the example sentences given.  Brute force is a totally ridiculous proposition given the length of the secret involved [2], though, so you're banking on people preserving language structure to aid in memorization to constrict your search space.  Otherwise you're basically screwed (not that you aren't basically screwed anyway if the sentence is really not derived from literature and 10 words long).<p>[1] For more, this is what you're looking for: <a href=""http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/what/shannonday/shannon1948.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/what/shannonday/shannon1948.pd...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://xkcd.com/936/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/936/</a>",1331616579

Alternatively, consider that blood plasma and many life-saving medicines that have no other use are still cheaper than diamonds.<p>In any case, let's go back to the original issue.

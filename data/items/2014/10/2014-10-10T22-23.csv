I didn&#x27;t express it well enough in the article, but one of the most difficult parts of the business was finding the balance where I could please the maximum number of item-buying players without even putting a dent in the value of those items in the economy. It was just as important to me that the items retain their maximum value.<p>Due to everyone&#x27;s obliviousness and doubt about the exploit, I think I was successful in maintaining that balance.

I find it highly dubious that the FBI has legal authority to access that server without the permission of its &quot;owner&quot; or a warrant. Regardless of whether Ulbricht was in possession of the server (as renter) or it belonged to someone else, the FBI would still need permission of that person or a warrant to search the server. In this case, I suspect that a U.S. warrant would not do as the server was located in Iceland. Probably, they would need cooperation from the Icelandic police and a local warrant.

8440438,comment,8438690,8439839,0,0,chipsy,,,"The marketing of the game gives me honest concern. It is the quintessential &quot;list of features&quot; that is indicative of technology made without acknowledging a critical, artistic perspective - that&#x27;s even true of the title &quot;Voxel Quest.&quot; If you can correct this and gain understanding of what the game _represents_ and what areas you _want_ it to be critiqued on, it will become both easier to design and to market. Narrowing always clarifies things.<p>There is one aspect in which you do show a definite perspective, and that is in the use of a simulationist philosophy: Everything done in deterministic, procedural, emergent ways. Now, one of the ways in which this philosophy gets challenged is the issue of &quot;you don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know&quot; - if your simulation is built upon bad premises, then it&#x27;s garbage in, garbage out.<p>So then, if you want to find the same kind of successes with the approach as something like Dwarf Fortress, Spelunky or Minecraft, you have to actively acknowledge where your simulation becomes intentionalized by the assumptions you make about how the world works. At that point you are in the business of making critical arguments through your game and the workings of its systems: Things like how the economy is tuned, frequency of combat, or average NPC reactions to violence, all send unavoidable messages about the totality of the world you make.<p>You can literally pick just _one_ thing that characterizes the world, consider it in depth and tailor every other system&#x27;s features around it, and have a fine game. Even Dwarf Fortress, which is extremely deep, shows intentionality in that the details it focuses on are descriptive and categorical(types of rocks, individual organs) vs., for example, being spatially accurate like the physics simulation of a racing game. What makes DF&#x27;s detail cool - and what makes it a big, complex game instead of a tiny one - isn&#x27;t that it attains atomic precision, but that everything adds up to a specific, detailed, believable narrative about fantasy characters doing the &quot;everyday things&quot; we expect to see in a fantasy world.<p>To put it another way: Eliminating things from the game makes it impossible to criticize those things, and every game eliminates something! But the things a game does show should have a ton of care put into them.<p>If you&#x27;re doing all of this right, you&#x27;ll be up at night with some fear over the internal struggle of the design decisions, instead of the actual production or marketing; you are already demonstrating the necessary skill to do those two - you have very nice graphics to show off in your trailers, which is a great entry point.<p>The only reason why the marketing looks hard is because there&#x27;s a lack of design intent, and thus nothing but bullet point features after you show the graphics. But the design can act as a master plan for the marketing, as it allows you to go on at length about the things being conveyed through the systems, vs. what the systems are, where your effort on details is going to go, and how you want the overall play experience to expand over the coming months.",1412981291

I did stuff in Clojure using Overtone; everyone else used a dialect of Common Lisp to generate MIDI files. I took off on this Overtone tangent because I had prior programming experience and a lot of curiousity about Clojure; most of the other people there were musicians, not programmers.<p>btw, these musicians were writing fairly sophisticated software in Lisp within two weeks of first being introduced to programming at all. :-)<p>You can see my own code from that experience here:<p><a href=""https://github.com/gilesbowkett/markov-bass-lines"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gilesbowkett/markov-bass-lines</a><p><a href=""https://github.com/gilesbowkett/clojure-circles"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gilesbowkett/clojure-circles</a><p>Caveat: my Clojure&#x27;s a bit rough, and not properly idiomatic.<p>Another, very unfortunate caveat: there was an extremely inappropriate remark from Dr. Cope which, in my opinion, alienated a pair of Indian programmers, the only people there with any programming experience at all, other than myself. After Dr. Cope made this remark, both of them were gone the next day.<p>Also, I have to say, Emily Howell is mostly a probabilistic beat-slicer which works against sheet music. Like almost all artificial intelligence, as far as I can tell, she is much more artificial than intelligent. Her previous incarnation, iirc, only sliced up Bach measures into new measures, although this had the interesting side effect of re-creating several measures of Mozart, who apparently was a huge Bach fan.<p>Oh also - I&#x27;m pretty sure Cope put a ton of source code in one of his books.

One of the things that has impressed me the most about Riot&#x27;s approach has been their willingness to make dramatic modifications to core game mechanics in an effort to keep games exciting for both players and spectators.<p>An example that indicates the difference between last year&#x27;s world championship games and this year&#x27;s is the ward system. Wards are items that a player can place near their current location, invisible to the enemy team, to gain vision into the fog of war, which is vital for decreasing risk in map-wide coordinated team strategies. Under the old system, pro teams often bogged down during the mid- and late-game phases as they vied for map vision superiority, and the only viable strategy was to purchase as many of the superior ward type (pink, with green being inferior) as possible and equip at least one player with a long-term ability to see invisible elements. Under the new system, both green and pink wards are valuable — the former are invisible to enemies and time-limited, the latter are visible to enemies but can detect invisible elements and are not time-limited — and all players have access to a periodic ability to place an extra ward or shut down enemy wards. As a result, the action in this year&#x27;s matches has been much more consistent, as teams can still angle for vision control without losing momentum.<p>Just today, I saw some rough notes (<a href=""http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/9dG0ndq0-rough-notes-pbe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gamepla...</a>) on changes being tested in public beta. The scope of changes is massive! Starting stats, behavior of towers, and the range of temporary buffs are all on the table for a major revamp. It would be really easy for Riot to resist improving their game under the excuse of &quot;this is the way we&#x27;ve always done it&quot;, but they continue to push and innovate from within. A great example of keeping a startup mentality alive within an established company!<p>=====<p>On another note more closely related to the posted article: for anyone that doesn&#x27;t already watch pro-level League of Legends and is interested based on this article, you can follow the remainder of the current world championship matches through <a href=""http://na.lolesports.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://na.lolesports.com</a> — the next best-of-five between two Samsung-sponsored teams should be very exciting.

What makes it OK to tell all your creditors &quot;I can&#x27;t pay, tough noogies!&quot; but not OK to tell one particular creditor?<p>When I say it&#x27;s OK to do that in general what I mean is that there are laws which say that it&#x27;s OK and nobody is pushing to have them repealed.

I just feel for the hapless student that is required to send a compressed archive of his work to the teacher, and is using tar for the first time.<p>There&#x27;s only one little exception: I didn&#x27;t know GNU tar doesn&#x27;t require the &#x27;-z&#x27; flag (which by the way means &#x27;this is a gzip archive&#x27;) when extracting tar.gz archive.  Anyway, I bet my hat that the &#x27;-z&#x27; <i>is</i> required if you compress something and output the result to the standard output: there will be no &#x27;.gz&#x27; hint to help the tool magically understand you want it compressed. If you omit it, tar will likely not compress anything.<p>The &#x27;-f&#x27; option is the most aggravating.  Nobody uses tapes any more.  Tar <i>was</i> doing the right thing, but no longer. -f should be dropped, or rendered optional, or replaced by &#x27;-o&#x27; for consistency with compilers… As it is, it&#x27;s just ugly.<p>> <i>It feels to me though that when people have issues with something like the unix command line its because they just wanted to get something done and memorized an incantation to do it. There isn&#x27;t anything wrong with that of course […]</i><p>Actually there is.  The users want to do something (usually a very common case such as compressing or decompressing an archive), then they <i>have</i> to memorise an arcane incantation.  Yes, tar can do much more.  Yes, the command line is powerful and flexible and more. This is Good.  (Seriously, I miss my command line whenever I have to touch Windows.)  On the other hand, some common cases are just not well handled, and it is full of idiosyncrasies that have <i>nothing</i> to do with the aforementioned benefits.<p>When the user wants to decompress files, it should not be more complicated than &#x27;decompress archive.tar.gz&#x27;.  Though thanks to an uncle comment, I now know of the &#x27;unp&#x27; tool, which works just like that: &#x27;unp archive.tar.gz&#x27;, and you&#x27;re done.

While it worked, and it was at the core of the company&#x27;s technology, it was truly the worst software I have ever had to wrangle into a production service.<p>You name it and ImageMagick could do it:<p><pre><code>  - Leak memory
  - Perform terribly until you find the magic incantation that is 10x faster
  - Output wildly different images after a minor patch release
  - Remove / change options after a minor patch release
  - Enormously degrade performance after a minor patch release
  - Have numerous security vulnerabilities all the time, which require frequent upgrades
  - Dump core more often than you might like
</code></pre>
It took us upwards of 3 months to simply move from one ImageMagick release to another (a few minor versions ahead), and we had to do all sorts of workarounds and A/B tests to ensure the images would look right.<p>I heard that GraphicsMagick was superior in that it maintained some consistency of behavior between versions, but it doesn&#x27;t have all of the functionality of ImageMagick. So we couldn&#x27;t switch to it.<p>Another company that I worked for had a fleet of several thousand servers running constantly just to thumbnail user uploaded images, and it was not unheard of for it to fall behind.<p>IM / GM are the stock answer to process images, but from my experiences they have no place in a production system. I think this is an area that is pretty poorly served by open source software; there are lots of libraries to handle different image formats, but no good infrastructure exists to tie it all together (that I&#x27;m aware of).",1412979862

8440302,comment,8439921,8439921,0,0,Someone1234,,,"It varies wildly. Some professors such as those from top tier universities are basically best selling authors in their own right so therefore they make a ton. Then you have other staff who are a huge risk by the publisher and they barely make anything.<p>The real reason college textbooks are out of control has nothing to do with professors getting rich, they aren&#x27;t. They&#x27;re out of control because publishers are doing professor&#x27;s grading in exchange for the professor just assigning the book.<p>Instead of a publisher selling a book for e.g. $70, they sell it for $100 and bundle with it a &quot;one time use code.&quot; This code allows students to log into a publisher run website and turn in assignments, complete problems, and so on.<p>So effectively the professor has outsourced a large chunk of grading to a third party and better still (for them) it is &quot;free.&quot; And all they have to do is assign the $100 book instead of the $70 one, then just log into a free portal and collect all of the grades for the semester.<p>Publishers naturally get very rich off of this. They only have to set up a web-site once and then they can resell it to dozens of different schools, hundreds of classes. Plus they really cut corners with the grading and questions too (often out-sourcing those to the original authors of the book as part of the contract to update the book annually).<p>The only way to solve this is to put pressure on colleges, departments, and professors. Publishers are doing what they&#x27;re meant to: trying to make every cent they can. It is professors and colleges which are failing in their duty and effectively outsourcing part of student&#x27;s education to a third party for a fee (which the student pays).<p>The only other thing I can see resolving it is states stepping in and essentially making rules which say that the tuition fees must be all inclusive (e.g. you must get given the textbooks on the first day of class, but the cost of those is included into the main fee so there is nothing hidden).<p>So even if this scheme continued it would all be out in the open, and students could accurately compare the fee structure between two schools, one that is taking part, and one which is not...",1412978908

If you have tips/pointers on where I should look (good websites, classifieds, etc.), things to watch out for, and just anything at all that may not be obvious to a newbie such as myself, I'd really appreciate it.",1178585389

But unless you are actually rich, you don't really have the freedom to not get a job.   So I would not describe this as purely a contractual agreement entered into by parties freely.<p>",1178585264

If you look at the top levels of any industry, you find just incredible levels of misogyny.<p>For one example we have good data on, the FBI taped the executives of a major US agribusiness company, ADM. And so we have, on tape, some of the incredibly offensive things these guys said. Theres no reason to believe other firms are any different.""",1178585036

(In the bad sense of the word ""exploit"") The employees freely agreed to come and work for you in exchange for a certain amount of money, and they are free to leave at any time. <p>If they were worth any more money than they were getting paid then they would change to a higher paying job.",1178584524

It makes me richer to exploit workers.  But if i don't exploit my workers than I will be denying my workers their economic right to be exploited.<p>So you see I am only exploiting my workers to help my workers, because my workers want to have the freedom to be exploited, really they want to be exploited, it makes them feel more free.<p>Wow I am such a nice guy.

Aaron got a huge amount of reddit's equity, but only put in a few month's worth of work into the site. ...'</i><p>equity, worth and time working are all mixed up if you are a founder. The original idea, the re-write, the bug fixing and all the crappy small things right up to the final sale mean at any one time each founder <i>out-contributed</i> one another at some stage. It's the final result that counts the most.  If he wasn't pulling his weight I'm pretty sure the others would have kicked up a stink and given him the boot.<p><i>'... always vest your equity. Not only for new hires, but also set up vesting schedules for the founders. This ensures everyone can make a fair exit, with no hard feelings. ...'</i><p>This I would agree with. Things don't always go to plan though and people may not like their new role, being told what to do, when. You know the drill. To me the biggest mistake by Naste` is assuming just because you buy a company out that all founders are equally as flexible.<p>The biggest impression I get with Aaron is people look at him, they see a kid  and skip the ability, intelligence, achievement and ideas bit. <p><i>""Heh"" I joked. ""I bet the first time my boss finds out where I am is when he sees my photo on the front page of his own website (Wired)""</i> <p>I cracked up reading this line because of the irony of it.",1178582909

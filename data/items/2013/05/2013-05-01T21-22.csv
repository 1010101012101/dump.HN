5641081,comment,5632465,5639694,1,0,Tuna-Fish,,,"> I feel sorry for anyone whose life as a programmer is library spelunking instead of solving new problems.<p>You do realize that the vast majority of all the things that need to be done are essentially ""library spelunking""? Not every programmer can spend his time doing AI research. A lot of the things that need to be done are ""easy"" but very work-intensive, and can be made much, much faster by good libraries. The majority of programming jobs are still essentially crud apps with a db backend, and CL is simply just a bad language to implement those in.<p>> If you think libraries are more important than having a truly interactive development environment that is Lisp 100% of the way down, you are missing out hugely on power and expressiveness. It has to be experienced to be understood.<p>I have experienced it, and understood it. And after 6 years of it, I switched to Java, because that's actually a more productive language to get things done in. Because even if the language itself is shit, things like internationalization and input validation have good libraries so I don't have to spend weeks working on getting all the little details right. Clojure buys me that, and a better language.<p>Clojure may not be a good enough lisp, but it's certainly better than CL.",1367445566

I just can't understand why it takes more than a second to open and close what is essentially a browser and webpage. Again, (Netflix?) is this partially due to the platform (PS3 or Xbox)? Does a Roku launch an app, or does it work faster by controlling the interface and merely making API calls? I should really fire up a sniffer when launching/browsing PS3-Netflix; it'd be curious what parts of the sluggishness might be explained by network trips having to, for example, going through the PS network, which I can imagine sucks.",1367445400

I spent 8 years living in Spain where people are convinced that their diet is the healthiest in the world, but by any ""modern"" standard is a nutritionist's nightmare: often no breakfast and fatty/sugary if you do eat it, tons of coffee, generally extremely high levels of fat including saturated animal fats, very high in salt and alcohol. Nearly all carbs are white and processed, very few vegetables. Breakfast, if eaten, is normally 10am, lunch at 2pm-4pm, and dinner at 9pm-10pm. No-one sleeps 8 hours.<p>That said, it does have some remediating factors - generally lots of fish and olive oil and (much) smaller portion sizes than the US. Also my cardiologist here in New Zealand said that they have a much lower incidence of heart disease than you would expect given the above, and no-one knows why.

We also enable them to browse, share and discuss the fascinating insights they discover with one another.<p>While there are mountains of raw data out there, only scientists and programmers can currently make any real use of it. Our mission is to make that data accessible and useful to everyone.<p>Our team has extensive experience working with large, complex data problems and in building and nurturing online communities.<p>We are currently a team of 4 people, and are looking to add 2 more talented individuals to the mix immediately.<p>1) FE Engineer:  You have a great design sense and some serious engineering skills.  You think the famous quote, ""there are only two hard things in computer science, cache invalidation and naming things"" is spot on.  Whenever you're browsing the web, you're constantly noticing things that could be tweaked and improved.  You're a pragmatist who's ok with ignoring IE6 users.  You've built complex, popular web-based applications before.  You want to join an early stage startup where you can quickly prove yourself and become the FE engineering lead.<p>Our FE Stack includes python (django), javascript (jquery, backbone), html and css.  Deep familiarity with all of these is a big plus, but not necessarily required.  Experience with mobile app development is also a plus.<p>2) Head of Marketing & Business Development: You're a natural born deal maker.  When you throw a party, too many people show up.  You know how to build, execute and analyze the effectiveness of a marketing campaign.  Bloggers and reporters know you, and love you.  You believe product design and marketing are one and the same.  You're ready to join an extremely talented product & engineering team and show them that everything they thought they knew about how to really promote and grow a new site from the ground-up is wrong.<p>If you fit the bill for either of these positions, and you think what we're working on sounds intriguing, then we'd love to hear from you at jobs@iknow.io.

However...<p>The graphs never show a 30K token mark, which is what the heap-allocation counter showed for their [programming language] classifier.<p>It's not clear to me that much RSS was saved. Maybe 20Mb? So, the next question is how many classifiers are running, where such a ""hit"" actually matters. Again, there is no 30K mark on the runtime graphs, but let's assume the generation to the graphs' left are linear. It looks like we're saving a half-second and removing most of the jitter, but it's not made clear how the removal of GC chunking has any effect on processing outside of the classifier. I just can't imagine how a couple of these classifiers can't keep up with the push rate of files to Github -- the classification improvements are neither low-hanging or part of the BigO in Github's stack. The process seems very able to run asynchronous at push time and un-deferred, if unrun, on page view. Unless they're seeing more than 1 million pageviews/sec (per classifier; just run more? one 20Mb service per httpd server?), because I can't really imagine hitting more than 10x their tokens (300K tokens), which is still only ~50Mb; the RSS graph, again, has a weird scale to suggest they might grow their tokens by 67x.",1367444818

I am building my first ""real"" web app this summer, and I am just looking for some general guidelines. I really don't know how long it is going to take, and I know a lot of this depends on the experience of the developer. So let me give you a little background on me:<p>I have been programming for about 2 years. I feel like my knowledge of Python is pretty good, although I never stop learning! I have been reading up on Django and have done the tutorial on models/views/etc. I also have done front end stuff, mainly playing around with HTML/CSS/Javascript, although I could definitely spend more time on learning Javascript/jQuery. I could go on, but I don't want to bore you to death, and I just am looking for an estimate anyways.<p>My app will handle many users at one time. It will basically be a CRUD app. The two things I really have to add in are Geolocation, and payments, both of which can be achieved through integrating third party services/API's. Everything except for logo design has to be done by myself.<p>So if I threw this at an experienced full stack developer, how long would it (approximately) take? How do I break something like this into smaller chunks to estimate the time it will take? And most importantly, how do I know which technologies I should brush up on prior to doing this - or do I just hack it and learn as I go?<p>Thanks in advance! Any tips - relevant to my question or not would be helpful as well!<p>EDIT: I am focusing solely on the tech side of things. While I know our product better than him, and very much contribute to our vision, he is responsible for handling business/legal/marketing etc.",1367443535

In an industry where everyone claims to do the same thing.  That's not going to work mathematically.<p>Other ways to handle it other than massive underemployment are grade inflation and redefining an ""A"" into a participation trophy or redefine ""A"" performance as brown nosing the boss or whatever.  Or redefine earning a ""A"" as we don't plan to fire you this year... at least at this time.<p>There is a lesson to this situation for ALL startups.  A genius can found a company.  Maybe a couple geniuses can found a company.  Maybe the first hire, or some of the first hires can be genius level.  HOWEVER...  Somewhere on the path to being a real, scaled, grown up company, you're going to start to hire from the general population.  It doesn't matter if you admit it or not.  As a management issue it probably helps to be aware of it rather than delusional about it, aside from the obvious ""people laughing at you"" thing.  You can push against reality for awhile if you're the richest search company that ever existed, or if you can get the .gov to pay any sum you ask for, or the most prestigious .edu or thinktank in the world.

When you generalize that to remote computers, or touchscreen gaming, it becomes less reasonable to force users of those systems to assume the intent of the programmer to stay out of jail.<p>It's a much more elegant and workable and fair solution to simply let the rule lie with the code, which is defined formally, and let the potential negative consequences of deploying code that is not fully understood incentivize people to be careful about what they deploy for interaction with the general public (be it slots, ATMs, or networked computers).<p>(An aside, PLEASE stop with the terrible physical analogies about locks and vaults.

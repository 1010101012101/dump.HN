She adds a OpenSocial a widget that lets her friends rate the recipie postings, if you opt-in those reviews get pushing pack into your news feed.<p>Their demo site:<p><a href=""http://loveguac.com/guac1.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://loveguac.com/guac1.htm</a><p>Seems like Orkut is doing all the widget parsing/generation. Curious how that works with FB/Hi5 and how they deal with security since the widgets are js.<p>Here is the video introducing Friend Connect:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIEwUxMrJ4Y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIEwUxMrJ4Y</a><p>And finally here are some examples Google gives, can't  wait to start playing with this:<p>* A cooking site - Review a recipe and provide comments which clarify or improve it. Add a recipe to a social recipe box that appears across multiple cooking sites.<p>* A musician's site - Post pictures from your latest concert on the band's site, and communicate directly with your fans.<p>* An extreme sports site - Play a motor cross game, then compare your score to friends and other site members.<p>* An academic site - Discuss and review articles in context with colleagues and the broader community. Filter the discussion to colleagues only, or widen your view. Forge connections with new participants whose comments seem particularly insightful.<p>* A shopping site - Read expert reviews and tips right next to the camera you're thinking of buying, and find a friend who has already purchased the same item.<p>* A philanthropic site - Cultivate a community around your cause, post pictures at fund raisers, let donors connect, and involve their friends.",1210661224

The granularity of the marked images is very low quality, but, the results are very good. This is the same reason that for JPG and other image compression techniques, you can downsample the hell out of the color components with no apparent degradation to the image quality.",1210658596

If so, please let us know which site that was so we can compare your experience and your decisions against those of the Twitter team. If not, perhaps you should go and do that first before sounding off on Twitter. No, I'm not a friend of Blane Cook's, nor am I a Twitter apologist -- I don't even use the service. But I do respect startup founders and builders far more than their critics, and I know that website architecture -- like most things -- is always easier in hindsight. \nFor perspective, please read the Hot or Not story in ""Founders at Work,"" then read Teddy Roosevelt's ""Man in the Arena"" quotation that Arrington is so fond of. (And yes I realize that reference is ironic given that Arrington started the pile-on against Blaine Cook. Arrington should try to remember that ""it's not the critic that counts."")",1210658411

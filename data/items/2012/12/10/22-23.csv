4901956,comment,4898920,4901601,3,0,reuven,,,"Israel, as a country, is nothing like apartheid, and it's a shame that you use that term.  Arabs can and do freely participate in all parts of Israeli life, including membership and elected officials in just about every mainstream political party.  It's acknowledged that more needs to be done to bring Arab income and educational levels up to those of Jewish Israelis, and there are far too many places in which Arabs officially and unofficially face discrimination.  But there's a world of difference between discrimination and apartheid.<p>An increasingly vocal slice of economists, investors, and entrepreneurs are saying that helping Arab citizens to found high-tech companies would be good for the country, good (obviously) for those individuals, and might help to bridge the divide between Israel and the Arab world.<p>The situation is sadly different in the territories, which I believe is a moral and legal albatross around Israel's neck, and one which we need to resolve as quickly as possible -- preferably by pulling out most settlements and recognizing a Palestinian state.<p>As for Palestinians returning to their ancestral homes, I'm afraid that as with countless wars over the centuries, that will not happen for the overwhelming majority of them.  The alternative would lead to an unlimited civil war, one which would have dire consequences for the entire public.  I feel bad for people who lost their homes, and believe that they should be compensated.  But no Israeli government, left or right, will agree for such a thing to happen, and I happen to believe that it's counterproductive for the welfare of Palestinians to focus on that, rather than building a free, democratic, and open Palestine -- something which has yet to occur, I'm afraid.<p>Finally, I'm not sure why you keep referring to me as a settler.  I'm an immigrant, a resident, a citizen, and all sorts of other things.  But I bought my home in a city within Israel proper, within the Green Line, despite all sorts of financial encouragement that the government gave me to go over the Green Line.

IIRC (and assuming nothing has changed in the months I was on hiatus):<p>If you have ever looked at an application for YC, it requires every member of the applying team to have a membership here and asks for your HN handles. If any team members do not have handles, they are required to get one in order to complete the application as that cannot be left blank. If you were an active member here for any time prior to submitting your application, your remarks here are, in some sense, part of the application. Participating here is an opportunity to showcase your skills, knowledge and general intelligence and also prove whether or not you pass the YC ""don't be an asshole"" rule of thumb.<p>That, no doubt, does quite a lot to help keep the place relatively polite and respectful since, for some people here, being an asshole can cost them a shot at potentially millions of dollars (assuming they get in and their startup is successful).

Even people who did a BS and sometimes MS often ended up getting graduate degrees and going into consulting. Why? The real money in this country isn't in making things, but in managing the people who make things, or in providing professional services to the managers. Silicon Valley is an exception right now, but only because consultants have yet to figure out how to drive down engineering salaries by outsourcing social network development to India (although Google, Microsoft, etc, have tried ardently to keep salaries down by engaging in anti-competive practices like agreeing not to poach each others' engineers).<p>Heck, even the Valley isn't immune to this phenomenon.

Even I, during some weeks, am nocturnal due to homework. I never had a roommate, but I would wake up due to my neighbors roommates. I HAD to adapt, or else I wouldn't be able to survive.

Players have come to expect this since Starcraft I.  The whole idea of tower defence that was made popular stands a testament to the fact that we can place walls and change terrain and units WILL change their path on the fly.  If you have played a tower defence in Warcraft III, you know that units can be lured into taking the A* optimal path, and you can block it off just before they get there, forcing them to recalculate a new path (which may be a long way away from where they currently are).  Then, you can destroy the new tower you just placed and block off the path they had just changed to, forcing them down the old path again. You can repeat this as long as you have resources to build your cheapest tower (this was an exploit that made certain user-created maps really easy).  Tower Defence designers now know about this and most of the well-made maps prevent you from building during level.<p>TL;DR: Path recalculation has been around since Starcraft I.\nEDIT: And probably before that",1355177508

As for actions that are in the gray area, either let the user configure which password is used, or just err on the safe side and use the strong password.<p>Also, a really killer feature (admittedly for power users only) would be an API for password manager apps to integrate more deeply into iOS. I love my password manager's browser extensions. If I could have password auto-filling on iOS like I do in the browser, downloading free apps would be much, much easier. For that matter, visiting password-protected websites in iOS would be a lot easier, too. You'd still have to type your crazy master password on the finicky touchscreen.

It is #1 on the US News & World Report and has a fairly high number of cross admits with Harvard/Yale. So everyone is high achieving/extremely driven. The primary differentiator is that it disproportionately attracts students who are very much sold on the ""study a broad liberal arts education for the sake of education and forsake career oriented life skills"". I.E. the attitude that gets mocked daily on reddit. I.E. the sort of idealism that led Paul Graham to study Philosophy in college (<a href=""http://paulgraham.com/philosophy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/philosophy.html</a>) is omnipresent on campus. Almost everyone starts an idealist.<p>This continues at Williams for a few years, until people panic and realize they don't have too many bankable life skills to get a real job. However, everyone is, or is surrounded by affluent, successful, career-oriented people. So they look around to find one of those successful career paths that are still open to them. Unless they are majoring in math/sciences (Williams has a 10% math major population, which is very high compared to the US average), or have already begun the pre-med track, the only clear avenues that aren't blocked off by their past decisions are consulting->MBA, and law school.<p>Disclosure: I attended Williams. About 25% of students double major. I started off with a clear ""1 major for me, 1 for life skills"" path, and intended to major in CS and Music.

With Android, a lot of appliance-like convenience was given up for more flexibility and control, which makes it more like a general computer. iOS, on the other hand, takes a more curated approach to UI (not to mention hardware options) and is easier to use since it is a more appliance-like experience. The ability to even clear app cache for an Android app shows that you are using a computer, and with that comes the complexity of operating one (granted Google is making attempts to make things easier in default cases).",1355177258

But for now, if the main server is down (hasn't happened yet, in four months of testing, but it will...), I only have a small bit of contingency, and don't have a hot backup.<p>Re-check for failure: Yes; if Server Check.in notices a site is down on more than 50% of node checks (once I have more than one node), it will check the site once more after a minute before sending a down notice.<p>API access: I don't have it yet, but I'm going to be building it (everything I've done on the site already has API data structures in placeI just don't have any of the interface or any kind of authentication system in place). I'm working on a mobile app that will be free for users, and will need the API up and running before I can launch it.",1355176835

And about half of those were double majors.<p>Edit: 13 majors, of which at least 10 were double majors (including me and Dave below).<p>Edit 2: Good grief. The whole lot on HN. Do any of us Ephs get any work done?",1355176814

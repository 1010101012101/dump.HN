Eventually we'd like to have close integration with AdSense so we can serve your AdSense units in your site's empty space.  Finally today, you can create TextAds and ImageAds that drive users to pages you monetize well or that you'd like to promote.  For you perhaps its: <a href=""http://www.dedasys.com/about.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dedasys.com/about.html</a>.  For others its a RSS subscription link or the ""buy a t-shirt page"".",1202374741
110808,comment,110792,110795,0,0,mixmax,,,"> ""We've been seeing click through of 5-20X times higher..."" hey that's great :-) I think that monitoring, A/B split tests and continually pondering on the data to find out how you get better click throughs is paramount to your business, after all that's where the money is. And without money there is no business...<p>> ""About the relevancy of ads we serve"" - I missed that one ;-) But I think that it is definitely the right decision to focus on what you do well, and do only that. Especially if you are only one founder and thus have limited resources.<p>A word about patents. I have done two startups, both based on patents I have. One of the things I would have done differently is to not focus so much on the technology that we happened to have a patent on, but go where the market leads. It is easy to become thrilled by a patent, but in my experience the only ones that care about it are investors. It's a great thing to have, but don't base your business on it. Just saying this because I noticed you mentioned it a few times in the comments.",1202374620
110807,comment,110792,110792,0,0,davidw,,,"How is this different from other ad systems?   My first impression is something along the lines of ""I have adsense, what's different about this?"".<p>It was a little bit slow loading this:<p><a href=""http://www.emptyspaceads.com/websites/preview_url?website%5Burl%5D=www.dedasys.com&commit=Preview"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emptyspaceads.com/websites/preview_url?website%5B...</a><p>But 'try it with my web page' is definitely a compelling feature!",1202374494

At the time of your application, you won't be able to do much about any of those. You can change your attitude though. By attitude, I didn't and don't mean you're a jerk. I meant more in terms of optimism.",1202374373

110803,comment,110792,110802,0,0,arooni,,,"Thanks for the feedback dfranke.<p>You actually don't need flash to run our demo, the ads are already appearing on that page (provided you have javascript enabled). The flash demo is only to help walk you through what triggers the ad appearing and disappearing.  We tried to make the ads as pleasing as possible and ridiculously easy to get rid of (hit the X, shake your mouse, or hit the escape key on your keyboard). I'd be interested in seeing what you think of them.  Example: <a href=""http://www.phonemyphone.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phonemyphone.com</a>.",1202374277
110802,comment,110792,110792,0,0,dfranke,,,"I don't have Flash, so I can't use your demo, but I think I get the gist of it anyway.  I'm wary of the placement options other than ""fixed"".  I have no tolerance for ads that do anything to cause my eyes to jump away from text -- this generally includes moving around the page or changing color balance from one animation frame to the next.  Whenever I see one, I'll hit the back button and never come back.  Most people have more patience with this sort of thing than I do, but I'd still urge caution.",1202374174

110800,comment,110792,110799,0,0,arooni,,,"Thanks very much for your feedback dawnerd!<p>We can definitely hook you up with ads for various games.  Check out <a href=""http://www.shoppingads.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shoppingads.com</a> one of the first ad networks we support.  They're an eBay super affiliate and operate as an ad network.  The bottom line is you can copy and paste their ad code into one of our forms and serve ads for video games for sale on eBay within your site's empty space.  We offer a 50/50 split with publishers for this type of ad (we call it a NetworkAd).  Please find my contact information in my YC profile, I'd be more than happy to assist you, feature you on our blog, and our home page when you launch.",1202373549
110799,comment,110792,110792,0,0,dawnerd,,,"I love the site design. Although I think the idea of any ad that just pops up like those do are very annoying. From your demo though they don't seem so. If you can get some ads for various games, let me know and I will sign up. I am launching a game review site soon and the only way I can put ads on the site without ruining the design is in the margins.",1202373306
110797,comment,110465,110465,0,0,mroman,,,"Personally, my productivity went up after me and my wife separated. No kids involved. 
It was a focus issue with me. I simply could not manage to fully focus on what I was doing when having to deal with another person's constant issues, whether it be this or that. Constantly having to pay attention to someone, having to go along with weekend activities I was not in the least interested in. Now, I love the woman, and we are still husband and wife, but I personally can't handle living with someone and therefore having my life intertwined with another person's life.",1202373063

110795,comment,110792,110794,0,0,arooni,,,"These are great points mixmax, thanks for your feedback.  A couple notes:<p>* We've been seeing click through of 5-20X times higher comparing existing ad units on <a href=""http://www.phonemyphone.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phonemyphone.com</a> with the same ad unit delivered in an emptyspacead.  So far so good :P.<p>* About the relevancy of ads we serve: First off, we're not an ad network.  We do work with ad networks to serve their ad units in website's empty space.  Secondly the publisher is free to create their own text and image ads as well as ShoppingAds which can be keyword targeted to the site's content.<p>* The core of the product is the patent pending ad format we've developed.  I think finding a bunch of advertisers and serving relevant ads is a hard problem I'd rather let others solve.  Hats off to the folks at AdPinion (<a href=""http://www.adpinion.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adpinion.com</a>) for being the YC company to step up and do this.",1202372829
110794,comment,110792,110792,0,0,mixmax,,,"Interesting idea - I like the fact that you don't mess with a sites design in order to serve ads. That said I think that your success will largely depend on the clickthrough rate - which is what customers pay for at the end of the day. And in this respect you might have a disadvantage, since visitors don't see your ads before they hover over an empty area.<p>Also you should watch out for your brand - there have been many examples of obnoxious ad models that tend to turn people off. A good way to nurture the brand is to serve relevant ads, and in this regard of course you have a formidable competitor in Google.<p>The reason Google is doing so well is exactly because they are non-obtrusive and relevent.<p>I would work hard with the non-obtrusivenss, and think about how you can serve up relevant ads. The last one is of course extremely difficult for a startup because you need a lot of data, a lot of customers and somebody with a good knack of algorithms.<p>But all the best of luck :-)<p>Just thoughts off the top of my head....",1202372531

I have come to respect this forum and and I'd really like to hear your thoughts.<p>Also for all you hackers on freenode that would like to have a discussion, but can't be bothered with HTML forms, I've set up an IRC channel to discuss: #emptyspaceads (my nick is arooni).",1202372035

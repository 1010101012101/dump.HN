Dump a file in a directory that does one specific thing, and you're good to go. No need to integrate it with the rest of your web site. It's just a little CGI-like script that does its own thing.<p>But if you use this on a smallish VPS, keep an eye on memory usage. Image processing in PHP tends to hog a lot of RAM, and even a small number of simultaneous requests can crash a server.

3872820,comment,3872613,3872613,30,0,ErrantX,,,"Hmm. About 2 years ago I bought myself a canvas and wrote on it the following:<p><i>Live happy, make friends, enjoy. Make those dreams happy</i><p>It was for much the same reason - to inspire me. However, about 6 months later I thought those idea through and realised that, actually, it was an example of ""making me feel better"". I could sit and look at this poster and think; ""yeh, I'm following my dream, I'm going to be happy"". I even had a list of goals to meet.<p>But really you're not; you're following an arbitrary list, and all that is is con-straining.<p>Here's my thought process; <i>trying hard to be happy isn't being happy</i>... That thought mulled for a long while; I was doing cool stuff, with people I liked, and having plenty of down time. But I still felt like it was an effort to pursue.<p>This year has been a revelation. I did something ""stupid"" and spent a lot of my savings on two big holidays (many years ago I discovered my truest love is travel). Yesterday I spent a big portion of what is left on my third holiday of the year. I've barely done any work since January - one product release and some bugfixes. I started writing, then stopped, wrote a little program for myself, tried some carpentry, almost trashed my car trying to fix it, stood for at least three elections (politics and social communities) on a whim, dated two girls at once. And this is the tip of the iceberg.<p>All of this wouldn't sync with the person who wrote that maxim 2 years before; it would seem reckless and silly. As if I was throwing away what I had worked for years to build. A load of fucking rubbish.<p>Right now I'm free.<p>And I smile more than I ever have in my life. I have more friends. My life is barrelling along where, 6 months ago, it was stagnant.<p>So I wrote a new canvas (about 2 weeks ago, actually) which now says:<p><i>Let rip</i><p>My point is this; take care, with some of these ideas, that you don't get too focused on the means to the end. Just relax, close your eyes, do what you feel like. In the end it will work out. One day we will all be dead - till then I am going to enjoy myself. :)<p>There is nothing wrong with a todo list topped by the words ""don't ignore your dreams"". But only if it makes you happy.",1335037957

Where are the companies making money selling private forks of enhanced FreeBSD<p>Sun Microsystems?<p>I think part of it has to do with a tipping point: if you can hire up a good chunk of the key contributors and run with it, then it's easy to make a proprietary fork, and at the same time weaken the open source project.  The GPL prevents this.  The other thing that prevents it is if it's impossible/difficult to hire up enough people for a proprietary fork to outstrip development of an open fork.  So with permissive licensed projects, you want a big core team comprising people with diverse interests and incentives.<p>Also, I think things have changed over time - perhaps, 'back in the day', there was more the idea of not contributing back by default, whereas I think far more companies have made their peace with open source these days, and understanding that being involved and contributing are good things.  This tilts things in favor of permissive licenses.",1335037702

That's the point - future you does not want to look back on a life of hard grind and no fun just so you can do the looking back from a gold bed on your huge yacht.<p>ii) Because seeking contentment now is a way to ensure that you'll be contented in future and the future you won't look back on a life of missed opportunities.  Missing out on happiness now is sometimes important in the short term, but it's not a great way to live a life.  Perhaps a lot of grind now means you can retire early and relax and enjoy stuff.  But you have to live long enough to retire, and by that time you may have missed some really fun things like babies growing.<p>> <i>the reality is that life is no more valuable at the end than at the beginning or the middle</i><p>Yes.

I couldn't really use my MBP without a Kinesis, so long battery didn't mean much.  But the System76 gets about 2.5 hours like most other brands.  The power supply is a beast though and adds another 4 lbs or so when traveling.  It also lacks the awesome mag-safe connector.<p>Bonuses: comfortable keyboard, nice rubber finish, no sharp edges, integrated keypad, plenty of ports and no need for dongles, replaceable battery, easy hardware upgrades, up to 32 GB RAM (I went with 16 GB), and well-supported hardware.<p>The trackpad is nice.

4398,comment,4198,4198,0,0,ph,,,"There is an update now on the article. Could be a very wise move.<p>""Update: Spokeswoman Kay Luo and co-founder Konstantin Guericke have since responded. Both said the change had nothing to do with the financing. Hoffman hired a recruiter almost four months ago, and interviewed 72 candidates. Hoffman wants to build LinkedIn into a multi-billion dollar company, they said, and realized LinkedIn needed to scale, which means giving more attention to management issues, something that isnt his strength. His passion is in the product, said Guericke, rather than in sorting out management stuff. Nye is a protege of Intuit Chairman Bill Campbell, someone Hoffman respects, Luo said.",1173976851

If you could hold all of your personal data in one place you wouldn't have to copy it to each computer, or email it to yourself every day or so. Just finding ways to not have to copy everything all the time would solve any problem there may be.",1173975882

4392,comment,4281,4362,0,0,bhb,,,"Yeah, the social stuff and the girlfriend are not really top issues, but still things we thought about. In fairness, my co-founder told me flat out that the gf thing was not a huge issue for him, simply because, like you said, it's going to be rough for them either way, and she understands we need to make this work.<p>As for the social aspect, I'll admit it - I'd like to be able to occasionally have some fun outside work. Do I think we're going to be partying every night (either in Cambridge or Denver)? Hell, no. Would I like to have some good friends around? Well, yeah. Is not having a group of friends available a con? Yeah, it is. My life is both work and play. I have no illusions about the ratio of those two while creating a startup, but I'd still like my limited play time to be of high quality.<p>Plus, It's very unlikely it would be for only three months - if it were just that, I'd wouldn't worry about it. But the reality is that if we move to Cambridge, I we wouldn't be leaving unless we had a good reason.<p>In any case, thanks for the feedback...",1173975447

Am I the only one who finds this supposed crisis to be a little hard to believe? When I run out of room on one of my drives, I figure out what to delete. Usually old and unneccessary data gets the boot. Is it so hard to believe that the world at large won't simply do the same? Albeit on a grander scale. Even better, we may become more efficient in what we decide to store in the first place, imagine that.",1173974943

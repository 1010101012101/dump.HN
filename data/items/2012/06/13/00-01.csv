(There are always economies or diseconomies of scale.)<p>Typically such questions imply the unstated assumption, ""answer to the same level of precision/abstraction as the question itself, and assume you have all the info needed to give an answer"". With that assumption both questions should be answerable.<p>Compression tends to be pretty parallelizable, if by nothing else than choosing to break the input into separate chunks. You might lose a little bit of efficiency in output size  more restarts, each compressor has less global information  but those don't mean slowdowns (and in a few contrived situations might even mean speedups at the cost of size). See for example 'pigz' and 'pbzip2'.<p>If I were asking this question, I'd accept the 'rough, assuming perfect parallelization' answer as correct-enough in the spirit and level-of-precision implied by the question. If the answerer brought up the difficulties in assuming perfect parallelizability or specific to compression algorithms or choice of inputs, that'd be worth some extra credit, and would trigger followups along the lines of, ""how would those factors affect the size?"" and ""what bottlenecks might you expect?"" and ""could it ever be faster when split among more machines?""",1339549019

The OS <i>is</i> worth this, in which case they've over-engineered: they made their particular OS do <i>way</i> more than it's supposed to and are trying to recoup the cost of developing so damned much.<p>Fundamentally, an OS needs to boot a device and provide resource management.

One of my particular areas of interest has been CSS3's animation capabilities. Frankly, I think it's super sweet.<p>Unfortunately, I also think actually writing animations kind of sucks. For simple things, it works, sure. But for more complex animations, it doesn't seem intuitive to me. I feel like it wants to be programming, but it isn't.<p>All right, so I've been working on a project to fix that for me. The project is called RCSS, meaning Ruby + CSS. As this isn't exactly my region of expertise, I'd love to hear some thoughts about the direction to take this.<p>The idea is that we can use a real programming language (I chose Ruby) to generate CSS animations for us. The syntax is sort of neat; I was heavily inspired by the animation functions provided by UIView in UIKit. The project is at an early stage (I've been thinking about it for months, but executed in the last two weeks), so it is easy to move it in different directions, depending on what would be most useful. Though as I view this as an experiment, so maybe it's not useful at all, I'd love to know what you think!<p>You can see an example of the kind of code you write using RCSS here: https://gist.github.com/2914616<p>The project is hosted here: https://github.com/jparishy/rcss if you'd like to follow along.<p>Thoughts and comments are appreciated/encouraged!<p>Thanks for reading.",1339547803

If Zynga has 60 million daily active users, thats 1.2M payers per day, more than enough to be profitable you'd think.<p>The real question is the value of their users, and whether Zynga can increase that value.  Zynga's largest expense is probably marketing and CPI costs have more than likely doubled (I don't know the exact numbers) on Facebook over the past couple years.  If Zynga hasn't increased the value of their users, that means they can acquire less, thus the drop in DAU.<p>The key equation for a free-to-play business is LTV > Acquisition.  Unfortunately, CPI for FB probably somewhere around $1 and on iOS it can be $1-$5 depending on who's buying the traffic that day.  This is why the social game market is difficult to survive in, because most small companies don't have the marketing spend to acquire customers at that cost.  For Zynga, these costs are starting to show in reduced DAU, due to a combination of natural declining retention and an increase in acquisition costs.",1339547797

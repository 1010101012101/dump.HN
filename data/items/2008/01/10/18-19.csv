96872,comment,96866,96866,0,0,mrtron,,,"From my experience, you are correct when you say VCs rarely are looking to lift a startup off the ground.<p>Most people I know and startups I have been involved in start off with cash from friends and family.  One of the most difficult leaps you take is quitting a paying job and taking a small sum of money and trying things out.  VCs definitely want to take an idea/product and scale it like you mentioned.<p>The one thing I would suggest is do you need 500k to start a startup?  I would suggest the number is closer to 1/10th of that to survive for a year, at least as an Internet startup.<p>EDIT: To clarify, I meant 1/10th of that to start a company for a year, not to personally survive for a year.  There are many necessary costs for a company that shouldn't total more than about that 50k mark, lets call it ""servers and shit"" costs.  I was completely excluding living expenses!",1199991546
96871,comment,96774,96774,0,0,gojomo,,,"Lived there for 5 years, working on 2 software startups. Very nice, though at a different scale and pace than SF bay -- which as the foundread post mentions, has benefits and costs wrt recruiting, turnover, etc. My vague impression is that the attention of investors and teams on opportunities has usually run 12-36 months behind the bay -- putting Austin slightly out-of-phase with bay funding/acquisition/exit cycles, meaning peaks are missed and valleys hit hard. So it's a better place for 5-15 year exit plans than 2-3 year exit plans.<p>One long-time Austinite thinks the local dominance of Austin Ventures has had a negative impact on the venture-backed software/internet space; you can see his rant in the first paragraph here:<p><a href=""http://www.xent.com/pipermail/fork/Week-of-Mon-20070924/046573.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xent.com/pipermail/fork/Week-of-Mon-20070924/0465...</a>",1199991316

Flash is one tool for making (vector) graphics, but you could make them in Photoshop/GIMP.<p>I use Flex, and it's more intuitive than Flash if you're used to OOP and IDEs (and not used to the timeline), but it probably lacks some graphical capabilities for game programming.",1199991239

96866,story,,,25,36,donna,"Ask YC: How do you (or how did you), a start-up, get your first lump sum of cash?",,"I've talked with a VC friend, who was willing to give me a transparent look inside their process.<p>Here's what a VC/Angel is looking for when they ask ""Do you have customers?""  What it really means is, do you have 7-8 employees and $1M in annual sales.  It doesn't matter whether a startup is  \nprofitable or not, but can that startup grow from 2 founders to 7 employees and get customers.  This proves it's worth taking a look at and may be scalable.  Hopefully generating a 10x return on investment over the next <i>5-7 years</i>.<p>Investors know that the failure of a startup isn't necessarily because of the idea, but in not having enough capital to keep afloat while figuring out how to make money.  My VC friend also says raising  \nthe $500K that's typically needed is a real conundrum for a start-up.<p>So my question is, How do or did you, as a start-up, get your first lump sum of cash to get started?",1199991010

My body always forces me to have at least 10 hours sleep, and scarily I can often easily be lazy and have 12 hrs.<p>When I try to wake up without enough sleep it just feels horrible. Sort of headache/stomach ache combo. I can set an alarm and force myself to wake up early if I need to, but I end up paying for it later and my body demands extra sleep to make up for it.<p>I get amazing bursts of creativity and clarity when I'm in an energetic phase - so I guess I'd be devastated if I lost that high energy. But a lot of the time there is just stuff to get done so if I had control over whether I have 8hrs or 10hrs then that would be ideal.<p>The reason 10vs7 is way worse than 8vs5 is that it kills my social life or side-project time. If I go to a party and only get back at mighnight, then I'm screwed if I want to get to work before 11am the next day. If I force myself to wake up at 8am, I can expect to be asleep at 6pm after work the following day.",1293854332

I asked a few questions of the regulars about what karma was and how to get it.  So I decided to contribute more and see what happened. I posted articles that I liked and the karma rose slowly. I found out that 200 points would get you the ability to downvote so I pursued that.  My respect for the community grew so I focused on fewer articles of higher quality. After I got over 200 I found that I very rarely used downvoting but I enjoyed the ""status"" it indicated.  Then pg raised the point level to 500 so that kept me active as a goal.  I achieved that and then posted an article without much substance but popular that ""earned"" me over 400 points. That was fun. I still don't understand how articles make the front page, but that's okay. I've settled in to posting a certain kind of article only. And commenting more.

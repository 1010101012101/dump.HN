If there was ever any objection to pure functional programming it would be that monads are complex and hard to learn and reason about. Putting an explanation of them with all sorts of mathematical terms is not helping the cause.<p>Not only are monads not the only solution to doing I/O in a pure programming language (stream based I/O or functional reactive being another), they need not such a mathematical explanation.<p>An I/O monad is a simple class modelling a box. There&#x27;s two functions for it, one puts something that&#x27;s not in a box in a box. The other function allows you to give it a function that is applied over the function in the box, without taking it out of the box (this is called a &#x27;bind&#x27; operation).<p>Note that there&#x27;s no function to take the value out of the box.<p>The trick is that the only thing that knows how to get the value out of the box is the VM itself. So its task is to at the end of your function, execute whatever function created your monad, and then execute all functions you gave it using the &#x27;bind&#x27; functions sequentially over the returned value (which might include unwrapping more i/o monads).<p>Since every bind function relies on the previous value of the monad, it can naturally only be executed sequentially.<p>Note that this explanation does not explain monads either in full or very accurately, it&#x27;s just one of the patterns that monads are used in, and hopefully gives you an idea about how it is that monads are used to enforce encapsulation and sequential execution of effectful functions.",1406285784

8084556,comment,8084302,8084443,2,0,yvdriess,,,"I would like to point out that there are classes of laziness. Haskell&#x27;s laziness guarantees that an expression will not be evaluated if it is not used.  e.g. take_first(42, 42/0) will not return an error.  This enables you to construct infinite lists of primes and such.<p>Some classes of functional languages had lenient evaluation, evaluation is still lazy, but all expressions will be evaluated at some point in the program. You cannot do the infinity tricks, but you can still write the nice recursive functions, those that are used to show off the benefit of laziness.<p>The Haskell type of laziness bites you in the ass when trying to do parallel evaluation, which is why you need the rpar/rseq constructs to avoid opening the nasty trapdoors that regular evaluation will not hit.<p>Even besides I/O and parallelism the laziness can bite you. Mainly, it can make it hard to predict memory/processing use, unless you are intimately acquainted with the innards of Haskell.",1406285608

They&#x27;re wacky for domain registrations and absolutely insane for e.g. virtual currencies used to purchase improvements in video games.  (If I sell you four dragon eggs for $10 and you spend 1 dragon egg on a Sword of Dragonslaying, do you know how much revenue I can recognize?  Make a guess.  Answer: I have to estimate your lifetime as a player given my best data of player behavior, subtract the age of your account, and pro-rate $2.50 over the remaining days of your estimated life.)<p>On the other hand, most time when tech companies chafe under GAAP restrictions, it is because they&#x27;re trying &quot;creative accounting&quot; in the abusive rather than the creative senses of the term.  Salesforce, for example, is periodically annoyed that they have to account for stock-based compensation to employees.  Well, yeah, you can&#x27;t simultaneously say &quot;Equity grants are why people work for startups&quot; and also say &quot;But on the other hand they&#x27;re totally free.&quot;  They also have some other things which are apparently allowed in their GAAP accounting but... are rather aggressive, like $3.5 billion in goodwill on the balance sheet.<p>Disclaimer: I have in the past held, and currently hold, options positions which express the opinion that CRM is far overvalued and which profit if the market decides to agree with me.",1406285328

Serial interfaces that came after that (SATA, PCI-E) were motivated by the fact that routing fast parallel synchronous buses for any significant distances is hard problem because of propagation times, which have to be roughly equal for all bus wires, which implies that PCB material parameters have to be known and reasonably consistent (and that means significant per-unit additional expense in PCB manufacture and testing cost).<p>Currently only interface that requires careful routing and design on PC motherboard is memory interface, which can be made short enough that manufacturing differences are negligible.

8084441,comment,8081556,8084238,1,0,boyaka,,,"His reasoning is safety, because it&#x27;s supposedly (and I guess understandably...) unsafe for cars to be moving at very different speeds next to each other. I assume what people are afraid of (or what actually happens) is that people in the lane moving slower might drift/shift into the lane moving faster and cause a collision. When this happens while both lanes are moving at similar speeds both cars are more capable of avoiding it.<p>I&#x27;ve been there. I&#x27;ve been in the backed up lane in traffic with the lane next to me moving much faster, near the speed limit. I often try to get into the fast moving lane and it is a bit scary because it can be difficult to see far back enough to get into the lane without cutting somebody off. I still believe it is the fault of the people in the slower lane for being there though, and it is their responsibility to stay in that lane or find a safe opening to get to the next lane. If I see a bunch of stubborn early mergers, I will assume that is where they want to be and I will drive past them like a bunch the bunch of parked cars they are. But I will indeed not necessarily drive 80+ mph and I will pay close attention to the movements of the cars.",1406283089

I&#x27;ve been travelling through South East asia for the last 3 months and at about 20 - 30% of the hotels I stay at the WiFi works fine but their DHCP does not. I presume this is because most routers in default config cache IP address for clients and when they run out of free IP address they just fail to assign new ones to new clients. If you notice the wifi works but your computer or phone times out when connecting set your ip settings as below:<p>IP Address: 192.168.1.xxx (xxx being between 50 - 200)\nNetmask: 255.255.255.0\nGateway: 192.168.1.1\nDNS: 192.168.1.1<p>This has worked for me in 90% of cases and you get your own private WiFi (as none of the other guests can access it ;)). There was one place I stayed at in hanoi where I got my own 90Mbps / 40Mbps connection due to nobody else being able to get on.<p>Sometimes the ip is 192.168.0.xxx and on rare occasions it&#x27;s been 10.0.0.xxx.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to help hotels fix this issue as I go but it seems most either get some tech to setup their router or plug it in and keep the default settings (sooo many places have &#x27;admin&#x27; as their router password) and don&#x27;t know how to fix it.",1406282433

Looking back, I definitely can see how she influenced me and helped give me the confidence to seek adventure and take risks.<p>For example, one time I decided to experiment with cooking and decided to make a dish concocted of orange-wedges, cheese, lemon juice, and some other random ingredients. My dad was concerned that I would waste the food (he was right) but my mother insisted that I be able to try it out for myself. It was the most disgusting food ever! I tried to eat as much of it as I could, but it was a good lesson that cheese and oranges aren't a great combination!<p>As I look back, I can remember countless examples of her encouragement to pursue new ventures (even when it was obvious I would fail). I can't recall her ever expressing doubt that I would succeed. And I guess she was right if you look at failure as a success in learning.<p>Anyway, thanks Mama! Happy Mother's Day!",1178211326

19032,comment,18956,19013,0,0,Tichy,,,"Here in germany several companies are making good money with mobile phones. Usually the payment is all through ""premium SMS"", which can cost up to 5. So you can sell an application for 5 by having the user send an SMS to a certain number (you can also make it a monthly charge of 5, if you are lucky). Not sure how it works in the US. A huge share of the 5 goes to the operator, I think at least 40%, but it still works.<p>I think there is room for Ad Support for mobile devices - is anybody even doing it yet? One could start a company focussing on that - making interesting applications available for ""free"" might also give the whole business a boost. <p>At the moment it has a very bad reputation where I live because mostly the industry was ripping of kids. I don't think there even is a portal to check for serious applications. The mobile games portals have some serious applications at times, but I don't think the target audience is likely to stumble upon them there.",1178211000

19030,comment,18956,19009,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"You definitely speak the truth. I think where the issues really show is when you try using the optional APIs, such as MMAPI. There is no requirement for specific codec support for example, which is a nightmare when trying to develop media applications in J2ME. You literally have to test on all devices or go through a beta program with a bunch of users with different phones and simply see if it breaks or not. For a small startup like us, its probably the only feasible way.<p>As far as UI differences, there are some good tools to help with that. You might want to check out J2ME Polish. On devices that will support it, you can get much more consistent and predictable results with how things will look on screen across platforms. I'm really impressed. Be aware though that if you dont plan on opening up your source code you'll have to pay a $1000+ license fee.<p>For these incompatibility reasons I'm actually drawn more to Windows Mobile.. I hate just about everything related to MSFT, but at least when you develop for Windows Mobile via VS2005 you get predictable results. What you see is what you are going to get and that is very valuable to a developer.",1178210687

They would be more likely to tell you that you don't compare to mainstream act xyz, so you better get lost. <p>In fact I suppose PGs essays would make good reading for forming bands, too - isn't a band a kind of startup as well?",1178209983
19016,comment,18956,19012,0,0,danw,,,"People dont see mobile as something to run apps on. They see them as fashion accessories. They want a pretty handset that comes for free with their contract. This is why many have a RAZR despite it having one of the worst mobile UIs I have encountered and very poor support for apps. Heck, even I bought bought one for the way it looked despite being a developer who should have known better!<p>Perhaps if you could market a 'myspace' phone or a youtube handset it might work? A phone with tight integration between the device UI and popular web apps. This looks like more of a marketing problem than a technical one.<p>",1178209957

Certainly as soon as you start trying to do anything 'interesting' it becomes a nightmare and there is a lot of space to improve. Mobile widgets might prove to be a good solution.<p>I forgot another problem: uncertainty about monetization. Theres no proven way to make money on mobile yet. Do you go ad supported? Sell to operators, device makers or users? Charge micropayments or subscriptions? It's hard to pitch a mobile startup when you dont know how you're going to make money from it!",1178209539

Probably atm it is a catch-22 as there are few useful applications so people don't worry too much about their phones capabilities.<p>Most adverts about phones don't even mention Java capability, it tends to take some detective work to discover a phones capabilities for development.

19009,comment,18956,18991,0,0,Tichy,,,"I have worked in J2ME games development for two years and I can say that #1 is not off at all. There is no way around testing your application on all possible phones, because they all come with the weirdest bugs. For an example of what to expect: on some phones, PNG images show up broken if they are structured in a certain way (ie pixel dimensions not an even number or dimensions of image exceed screen size). Some method calls just crash the phone. Persistence might take forever or not work at all. Starting the application might take forever - on some phones it is slow if you load lots of small files, on other phones it is slow if you load fewer big files.<p>And it IS a pain to adapt to all possible screen sizes - granted, it might be a problem of designing the application, but as I was working on games, the design was often based on fixed size images. Especially as font support is crap with J2ME. Maybe flash for mobiles does a better job, haven't tried it.<p>Another thing that used to suck with J2ME: there is no standard for text entry, so it is difficult to integrate text entry nicely into your application. The only standard way is to switch to a blank screen that supports your phones text entry method, so you can't integrate it into your design.<p>Another problem, which I currently face: even if you know what phones you support, how can your customer know? Phones are usually not labeled with their technical name, so if you say ""Nokia 6230i supported"", it might mean nothing to your customer.<p>I wouldn't say it is impossible to make money with mobile applications, though. It seems also the price for mobile networking is falling.<p>Edit: the mobile games company I was working for was and is very successful and also in the meantime was bought by a big international entertainment company (think the Coca Cola of Entertainment). When I was there it was a 7 people company, so I think it qualifies as a successful startup (I think now they have 50 employees).",1178208925

For the good of the industry, I hope he's right, and the standards-based web continues (for the most part, i.e. overlooking multimedia) to thump vendor-specific solutions.<p>However, MSFT has a much greater ability than either Adobe or Sun to cram things down the user's throat.  They have their 'update' services, their ability to bundle, and their presence on the desktop with which to nag.  This could help them w/ Silverlight market penetration, a prerequisite for making that platform a competitor to the standards-based web .",1178208335

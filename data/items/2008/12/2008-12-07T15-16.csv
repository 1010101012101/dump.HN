""IT"" can mean a lot of things - much of the pure IT sector covers everything from being someone who plugs in the cables through to authorizing multi-million dollar purchases of equipment - not necessarily development or engineering.",1228664747

Again, identify a problem in your locality and ask your friends, colleagues, neighbors if they are interested in forming a group (officially with bylaws etc.,) and make representations as a group, which insulates you from getting targeted as an individual.",1228664662

388910,comment,388885,388898,0,0,time_management,,,"True, and just as bad women can fuck up your life, bad investors can ruin your company. I guess the difference relevant to my point is that between the average and the exceptional. It makes sense to take funding from a source of average reputation and prestige, if the terms are good, rather than holding out for Sequoia. In dating, the ""average"" match isn't very good, and it makes a lot of sense to hold out for the mind-blowing awesome woman.",1228663917
388909,comment,388265,388904,0,0,petercooper,,,"Since it was not in response to an initial argument, you are formally correct. However, a more common, less rarefied definition of <i>ad hominem</i> is <i>""appealing to personal considerations rather than to logic or reason.""</i> In this sense, any insult based on personal taste with no logical basis is an ad hominem attack, which by definition is a fallacious rhetorical device. In either case, I am not open to prescription.",1228663593

388906,comment,388728,388728,0,0,time_management,,,"VC is working its way to irrelevance, due to the ""no man's land"" around $150-500k of initial funding. This is, uncomfortably, the order of magnitude which can give a serious start to a promising idea: 2-4 peoples' salaries, plus operating expenses, for 12-18 months.<p>Investors seem to either want to put up small amounts (~$20k) that equate to mere weeks of living expenses, or make multimillion dollar investments, forcing a company both to give up an unreasonable share of its equity and to grow more rapidly than most tech companies are ready for (just try adding 6 new programmers to a 2-person project). By having a blind spot inconveniently placed right at the amount that most startups need, investors are pricing themselves out of relevance.<p>Given this undesirable arrangement, the reason startups exist at all is that most tech people usually have some savings after being employees for a few years, and during good economies, it's so ridiculously easy for a talented programmer to get a decently well-paying job that no one's worried about risking some savings by working for equity and deferred pay-- e.g. quite possibly for free-- on a cool idea. If the economy continues to sour and the ease of finding a good job is no longer the case, startups will have a much tougher time finding people to work pre-funding, and if investors aren't willing to meet startups on their needs, there will be fewer of them.<p>One major trend (and a positive one, in my mind) that I'm going to call in the startup world is that many, many more startups in the 2010s will be starting in smart, low-COL locations such as Minneapolis, Madison, and Portland.",1228663291

Over the past several years I've seen things and thought of ideas that I've written off as not viable or outright crazy (or at least against the current trend), only to see people do them themselves a year or two on.<p>I know I'm not the only one. But, perhaps, for some of us it takes enough of these events to occur before we start to feel confident about our ideas - while those who naturally have confidence by the bottle are out there, ""pre-stealing"" our ideas and having a lot of success with them.<p>Lesson for me from all of this? Be bold, ""just do it"", be <i>really</i> fast, and actually listen to your gut instead of writing it off as nuts.",1228662148

They're hamstrung somewhat by European regulations that prevent them from penalising companies for hiding their profits in other EU countries. But it's a cat and mouse affair and the HMRC can only be reactive unless someone comes up with a perfect tax code.<p>><i>They're upset that the loopholes are being used by the wrong companies.</i> //<p>You mean the richest, most successful, most popular, most used by the UK population and most profitable?<p>><i>I doubt they'd be receiving any negative press.</i> //<p>So in your opinion the UK press is in the pocket of the government who're only highlighting morally questionable tax avoidance as part of a shake down to boost some sort of protection racket? That's what it sounds like you're saying.<p>Personally I think the answer lies in some sort of underpin based on gross revenue levied on all companies over the VAT registration threshold but with the option to apply to have the underpin removed if one can prove in good faith that the underpin is onerous.<p>Amazon could still pretend they're working out of Luxembourg (500 workers) instead of UK (15k workers) but they'd pay on their revenue anyway. That way Amazon can't put UK tax paying firms out of business (simply by undercutting and relying on the extra profit from not paying tax to stay a float) and then off-shore all the taxable profits leaving us with no UK tax paying businesses (but even more consumption).<p>Just think of all the high wage bills for accountants that could be saved.",1359493191

How many OS upgrades have you gone through?<p>My point is not that storage matters, or doesn't matter, of course it does. My point is that everyone who has bought something with storage has experienced the ""comes with X amount of storage (note Y is available for users)"" verbiage. And Microsoft doesn't go out of the way any more than any other company at ""hiding"" that information from you. Neither does Apple, neither does Google.<p>So you read the box/advertisement/review and you gloss over the ""storage"" number to find the ""available storage"" number and you see if that will meet your needs, and if not you go to the next higher unit of storage.<p>I totally get that the <i>first</i> time you buy a technology product you might miss that, especially if none of your friends are technology users, but you also probably missed it the first time you bought a car and noted that the mileage values on the window didn't really match up with what you were seeing. Or after you cut the bone out of that 10 lb Ham you bought and only had 6 lbs of Ham left over.<p>It seems like faux outrage to me.<p>Now had Marco gone the other way, public ridicule that it takes 43 freaking Gigabytes to provide a web browser and some apps.

Titans belong to the biggest corporations, alliances, and coalitions, and are essentially floating cities that support fleets of other ships.  They're a strategic resource that individual players would never use.<p>In the case of this particular battle, CFC lost 3 titans.  This alone is several thousand dollars worth of real-world money, but it will barely be noticed.

There's a fuzzy line somewhere and it really feels like this is on the wrong side of it.<p>Also, if you look at it in terms of dollars and cents, Apple prices their iPads more or less based upon storage so you're looking at a situation where consumers are legitimately making different decisions due to this problem. In other words, a 32GB iPad and a 64GB surface pro are comparable in capabilities whereas a 64gb iPad provides much more storage than the surface.

That said, I think even JavaScript guru's generally agree that the language itself is actually pretty awful unless you know all of the legacy quirks and WTFs it is dragging along.<p>Sure, Crockford is probably the best example.  But the same is true from many languages that became popular before 2000.  C is notorious for its pointer magic and buffer overflows.  C++ is notorious for being an ""expert language"" that takes years to master.  Java is hated for being very verbose.  I know someone, long term (Ex-)Rubyist, hating the language for not scaling well and being hard to debug.<p>Maybe I'm too pragmatic but I think in every language there is something to hate.  (Haven't seriously tried C# though ;)<p>I think at the end of the day the libraries make up at least 50% of the overall language experience.  In the recent years JS has got a number of high quality libraries like jQuery or underscore.js that transparently circumvent many behated JS features.

I think you're underestimating what can be done in SQL--recursive queries and correlated subqueries are not part of most competent developers' ""standard toolkit""--but I think you're illustrating the problem with the OP's point, which is that most competent developers get through joins and outer joins (usually inheriting a lot of weird mythology like ""joins are expensive"") and can select/project and that's about where the skills end. So while I disagree with you in principle, in practice most people's SQL skills are inadequate even for an analogy to functional programming.<p>I would not say that the thought process I use when writing SQL queries is ""more like"" my thought process when doing functional programming than imperative programming. In truth, the similarity is all in what isn't present: I'm not deeply worried about what the machine is going to do with my request and how it's going to process it. I remain cognizant of what's ""really happening"" to the extent that I want to avoid obvious performance pitfalls, but it doesn't become the overriding obsession that it is with procedural programming.<p>With declarative programming I worry much less about whether the result is correct, and this is the primary benefit to me.",1359492497

I had a couple of occasions where the OS hard-locked, but on reboot Sublime started right back up to its last state -- including unwritten changes to multiple files.<p>- During a move to a new distribution, once I got my old /home remounted, Sublime amazingly did the right thing and again reloaded all of its state from the last operating system. I was expecting to have to re-open 30+ tabs/files and redo all of my user settings. Nope, Sublime did the right thing again.<p>- An update on my current OS has caused a problem with fuse which is causing my development directory to get unmounted on a regular basis. Sublime doesn't have a problem with this; any files that it loaded from the now-unavailable mount point are still there, the content is still all there, it doesn't freak out, it just marks the file as dirty (letting me know I need to remount that directory again).<p>- An rsync went afoul and nuked a pile of changes to a local development copy of a site. I was able to retrieve a bunch of my work from Sublime's open tabs.<p>None of these things are really examples of brilliant new engineering, but, in my experience they're all the kinds of details that too many other programs don't get right.

Promises have come a long ways since then, and I tried out Q.js and discovered that I was missing out on a significant and powerful abstraction. The two things you're missing out on here are:<p>#1 Promises have strong guarantees. A promise will be resolved at most once, and it will be either resolves successfully or unsuccessfully. This makes reasoning about them and composing them together much easier. For example, whenever I need to perform multiple async calls with callbacks I've always got to write a bit of repetitive error-prone boiler plate to wait for and combine their results. With a good promise library this is a one-liner using a well tested library function.<p>#2 Error propagation. With callbacks most exceptions vanish into the ether, only catchable by window.onerror and friends. Propagating that promise up to the caller who can handle it is an enormous pain in the ass and requires repetitive error handling code everywhere if you want to be resilient. With promises an exception raised in a handler counts as the resulting promise failing, which can propagate up similarly to the way exceptions propagate with try/catch. Again, this makes writing reliable abstractions so much easier.",1359491913

5136088,comment,5134022,5135816,6,0,tolmasky,,,"My point is that I don't think (from my own experience), that these things have necessarily been made any more understandable in OS X land by half-porting some of these iOS metaphors. My concern is precisely that the experience really has not gotten much easier for novices, but more convoluted by competing ideas of the way computers should work shoved together.<p>Let's look at the hard drive example in more detail. What did we lose by hiding the hard drive? Arguably the most important thing was access to Apps. This has been a critique of OS X for a while, that the main way to access Apps is this strange folder that lives in the hard drive. Perfectly fair thing to want to fix. Spotlight made it simpler to launch for pros, but you can't expect the primary way to launch an app to go from recognizing an icon to remembering the name and typing it into a textfield that appears when you click on the top right, especially if the goal is to move to a world where people buy LOTS of apps. So to remove the hard drive, you need another easy ""visual"" way of moving through your apps. What they chose to do was introduce the ""application picker mode"" to replicate the home screen of iOS.<p>But the problem is that this is NOT the home screen of OS X, and so the experience is jarring and scary vs. a safe place to return to. Perhaps had they done something bold and said, look, by default now this is what you look at, then maybe it would have been interesting. Instead it is literally a bolted on feature. In iOS, there is no question how to launch an app, you see them all in front of you. In OS X, you start with a strangely empty desktop and a few ""blessed"" apps in the dock, and you are supposed to divine that a <i>chrome spaceship means ""show me the rest of my apps""</i> Or perhaps you are supposed to figure out that a five finger gesture does that.<p>I have not done extensive user studies of course (but then again, neither has Apple), but I have witnessed this feeling scary to people like my mother. They don't know how to get out of it and are afraid to touch anything. It is not the safe ""home"" of iOS, it is the exact opposite: bizarro desktop-is-blurred-out mode. Touching most things on the screen now leads to launching <i>some</i> application, and since OS X comes standard with a ton of apps you'll never use, the app they launch is probably a random app they've never heard of which results in me getting a phone call asking whether they should be scared because they launched Time Machine or Game Center or some other thing.<p>Again, my point is not that Apple is not worrying about novice users, its that these features feel exactly like a pro user lazily saying ""fine they want iOS, here's iOS"". Apple understood that desktop metaphors wouldn't necessarily work on a phone, that's why they took the time to think up new ones. It would be nice if they'd also realize that phone metaphors don't always work on the desktop. Or at least think these things through a little more before just dumping them in.<p>I 100% think there is a system that is 1000 times easier to comprehend for people and hides the hard drive in a way where the common user will never need or care for it. OS X is NOT that system.",1359491792

Ive often wondered whether such ideas might be elevated to first class concepts within future programming languages, complete with their own rules and specified interactions, just as today we have variables and types and functions, and a language will prevent errors like calling a function with only two values when it expects three or trying to use the value 20 where a string is expected.<p>For now, Im hoping that functional programming, in the pure sense, will raise awareness of the potential benefits of controlling side effects rather than allowing them more-or-less arbitrarily as most imperative languages today do.

He says LTV should  be at least 4x cost of customer acquisition (CAC) and that he would pay $60 for a warm lead.  So let's assume he follows this and 4 x $60 is his LTV = $240.  With 22 leads from TechCrunch the total potential value of those leads is 22 x $240, not 22 x $60<p>TC leads were potentially worth $5,520 if fully converted (not $1,320 - which is the <i>cost</i> he's willing to pay for equivalent leads)<p>Of course, very rarely do all conversions occur but I think when doing marketing it is important to know the fully converted value of each channel (in this case PR) so that you can figure out how much to spend.  In general $5,000 of potential revenue (or TCV) is my minimum bar for a PR story, for example, so this story makes the cut just barely.  I think the TC traffic they got was pretty abysmal, probably would be worth it to hire PR next time since they've got a B2B product that can afford $60 per warm lead<p>Conversion rates can change and constantly be improved on the product/sales side (public pricing, free trial, free + premium features for upsell, etc) but I've found that often growing the TCV (total converted value) of the channel is more worthwhile than trying to optimize in the early days when fixing conversion is harder than just finding attention opportunities.  If you can find channels that consistently drive you leads worth 10-20x CAC and continue opening the channel more (getting more TC stories for example) you can figure out where its limit it.<p>This topic has been on my mind a lot, needs a whole blog post on DistributionHacks to dig into channel methodology and running multiple experiments to find the TCV of leads for each, stack rank, and implement system for scaling that as a business machine with predictable inputs and outputs --- but I haven't had time.

The upgrade from snow leopard to lion pretty much left my mid 2009 macbook pro unusable. After many miserable months I gave up and switched over to a linux desktop for full time development work.<p>However, my brand new shiny 2012 macbook air _flies_. It's about as fast (build times, and what not), as my 2009 era desktop running linux. I have had similar experiences with my iphone hardware. You have to keep upgrading hardware if you want to keep up with the latest software.<p>Given that, there are still some awful bugs in later incarnations of OS X that remain unfixed. For example, lion's retina support broke external 30"" displays in landscape mode. This is still not fixed 2 years later, despite bug reports and a very easy to reproduce problem.

Social proof sounds really good until you start to think through that a lot of so called social proof actually comes from relationships built through serendipity of what school your parents could afford to send you to. It's not unusual, to steal a line from elsewhere, to be born on third base and think you hit a triple.<p>I see this even more with MBAs than comp sci and particularly in downturns (having been in Silicon Valley a long time now) where weaker VCs invest in MBA buddies as easy decisions in tough climates.<p>Credentials are great as lazy decision making tools for big co hr departments - you don't get fired for hiring the Ivy Leaguer. But for startups make sure you're hiring for what someone can do and has done, not for what paperwork they've accumulated. I've made the mistake of hiring the high flying Ivy League wunderkind straight out of college, highly recommended... it was an absolute disaster but my own fault for taking this as proxy for being good on a startup.",1359490201

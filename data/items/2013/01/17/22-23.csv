5075801,comment,5075370,5075370,1,0,mrb,,,"Of course the C language and compilers are so simple, and C sits at such a low level (right above assembly) that few things can go wrong in it (compiler bug) or under it (cpu bug). As people jokingly say, C is just a high level assembly language. If one tried to re-invent a language with C's properties, one would come up with C, again.<p>For these reasons, I too expect C to remain the most performant and reliable <i>high-level</i> language baring any major change in computer architectures.<p>Debating this fact would be the same as debating whether assembly is the most performant and reliable <i>low-level</i> language or not. Of course it is. (Preemptive reply to the doubter: as an example my 64-bit assembly implementation of MD5 is 75% faster that a 64-bit C implementation: <a href=""http://www.zorinaq.com/papers/md5-amd64.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zorinaq.com/papers/md5-amd64.html</a> )<p>And of course, performance and reliability don't always need to be #1 priorities, therefore, as the author says, ""most every popular language has uses where it's a better choice.""",1358463562

I am aware, however, that what I'm about to say may be considered controversial given the nature of how this case is being reported--and how it's being responded to.<p>Whenever we have shootings like the one in Newtown, we talk about gun control and mental health care. There is always that talk about mental health care. But when someone commits suicide, regardless of cause, those same mental health advocates are nowhere to be found. Why?<p>There are hundreds, maybe even thousands of people who have it worse than Aaron Swartz did, but they don't go killing themselves. Some people lose their spouses and children in house fires, along with all of their belongings. They spiral into depression, lose their jobs, go back to living with friends or family, see nothing but bleak prospects and they ultimately pull out of it. Others lose their fortunes and things they've spent their lives working for, a few of them do commit suicide, like the ones after the 2008 financial collapse, but some don't. There are people who commit crimes and know they face stiff prison sentences, like life sentences or death penalties, but they don't kill themselves.<p>I could go on and on about how much worse it is for people in third-world countries, for those who don't know where their food and clean water are going to come from day in and day out. I could go on about the people who are brutally bullied, day in and day out.<p>Many of these people, some in arguably worse condition than Aaron Swartz was in prior to his death, don't kill themselves. So when we're faced with a case like Swartz's, why are we so quick to find someone to blame?<p>Yes, prosecutors were overreaching and giving him hell, but they didn't kill him. He killed himself. Hell, there are people who are currently serving long or life sentences in prison who are innocent of the crimes brought against them, but they're fighting and hoping from within their cells. Many of them are not committing suicide.<p>All I'm trying to say is it takes a lot more than a prison sentence, 6 months or 50 years, to get most people to kill themselves.

There are only two options at that point:<p>(1) The punishment goes beyond reasonable bounds, because deterrence is given priority over being reasonable; or<p>(2) The punishment remains reasonable, so it doesn't deter, so the issue keeps coming up; and at some point, as you note, it will end up having to be addressed politically.<p><i>Judges need to stay within the limits set by maximum sentences and sentencing guidelines, even if the judges believe that this punishment is not enough to deter the unwelcome action.</i><p>You are basically trying to say that #1 should not be pursued, and I agree with you.

5075753,comment,5075744,5075744,1,0,datemapps,,,"Hey all,<p>I wanted to get some input on your thoughts on data scraping. Our mobile app, DateMapps is dependent on the content input of the users. Specifically, the app allows users to view date itineraries and filter by their dating preferences to select one that will be of most help to them on their next date. However, unlike web-based sites that are dependent on user-generated content, it is difficult to get enough content to populate the app without it being available on the app store. We've encouraged users to create date itineraries through using test flight, but the process unlike the app store where one can simply download and begin to use the app, is often cumbersome and sometimes a deterrent. With that in mind, I'm deciding between releasing the app to the app store with minimal content (slightly over 1,000 date itineraries) and allow for organic growth from there, or scrape data from sites like Yelp. My issue with releasing to the app store is having users not be satisfied with the minimal content out there and thereby view that at being unhelpful (understandably so). Going back to the scraping option, though I could just use Yelp's API, it's important that the content is relevant to date spots and activities. Additionally, the profiles related to content are also necessary. Aside from that, I don't want to sacrifice the quality of the content by going with the scraping route. I'd love to hear your thoughts, especially if you've been in a similar situation.",1358462903

When something is horribly wrong, I'll get a core dump and the full stack trace will indicate the path from Tcl, on up into my bindings, and further into the library in question. From there, typically with a small amount of inspection and testing it's easy to isolate the problem area and fix. This way I've solve application (Tcl script) code, my library bindings, and errors in 3rd party (open source) libs -- I've got no doubt that there's room for improvement in my process -- either by tools or techniques.

C has nothing like STL -- no good portable data structure library. (STL isn't that great, but it's passable and ports to everything.) Operator overloading is nice in places, like with data structures and for mathematical code, but should not be over-used. Exceptions can also be useful, though in my current code base I am not using them much.<p>Boost is somewhat tempting but it's just too convoluted in places. Haven't had a reason to use it yet. Qt is nice for GUIs.<p>The thing about C++ is that it's a language that lets you do almost <i>anything</i>, and it has no stylistic traditions. It's like Linux if it has <i>absolutely no</i> filesystem layout standard or LSB. Each C++ sub-community (Microsoft, Qt, Boost, etc.) has its own conventions that are in conflict with one another. The language imposes no internal sense of discipline and carries no de-facto coding standard. As a result, I find most C++ libraries to be annoying to use even in my own C++ code. I tend to use it as a top abstraction layer gluing together underlying C libraries and system calls, and to use most C++ libraries (except STL) reluctantly.<p>It's too bad... well-done C++ can be very clean, efficient, and safe from things that dog C such as memory leaks, buffer overflows, or rare core dump crashes due to things that could be caught and handled as last-resorts in a try{} catch ( ... ) {} construct.",1358462611

I (and many Israelis) would agree that Israel could probably benefit from lower taxes, more privatization, and less regulation. Ironically this is why, despite being Jewish and strongly ""pro-Israeli"", I oppose foreign aid to Israel: it helps prop up an inefficient system in Israel and serves as corporate welfare for US arms manufacturers (I think some of it has explicit provisions that it must be spent with, e.g., Colt or Lockheed-Martin as opposed to IMI or IAI).<p>Yet, go up to any Ayn Rand fanatic and ask them if they'd prefer to live in UAE/Qatar/Bahrain or in Israel.

A socially liberal populace is the end-result of education.

You know this is not true given US as it is. It may be true of a social democracy in Europe, but this is just not true of the US.<p>The wealthy web designer in NYC benefits from police protection, public transport he can take everywhere, subsidies and grants his university (whether public or private) has received, the use of eminent domain to build said transport, the use of eminent domain to turn over land to a real estate developer that built his apartment building, and (most obviously!) the Internet (once called ArpaNet) from which he makes his living.  After tax, the web designer has far more left over and suffers less anxiety as he isn't living paycheck to paycheck (unless he so wishes).<p>I don't know New York geography as well, so I'll switch to Bay Area to discuss the $30k/year individual (who, by the way, is not eligible for welfare). First, they likely can't even reside close to an area with public transport and jobs, so they're commuting two hours from, e.g., Stockton or Modesto (having to pay for vehicle maintenance, car insurance, license and registration fees themselves). Yes, they do benefit from the freeways, but the stress involved in driving on the freeway (high traffic, long commute, high risk of accidents) is far greater than the stress involved in taking the New York Metro.<p>They're far more likely to have an unpleasant experience with police personally (being pulled over, searched, etc...). Their city police forces are also reluctant to pursue anything other than violent crime. After tax, a far higher percentage of their income goes to meet the basic needs, and it usually does not -- they're underinsured, they suffer from obesity (due to eating cheaper, poor quality food: fast food joints and microwaveable mac-n-cheese, etc...), and overall poor health.<p>I have a lot of sympathy with libertarian views (I voted for Gary Johnson as a protest vote in 2012 elections, actually), but their sympathies are simply misplaced: argue for less welfare for the upper classes (e.g., mandate that new public transportation must cover the poor communities <i>first</i>, oppose use of eminent domain by real estate developers), lower taxes for the poor, higher long term capital gains in place of higher income tax (with some reasonable limitations as not to stunt economic growth), etc...<p>The wealthy do not mind high income taxes. Simply put, look at their voting patterns: 75% of them vote for Democrats, 25% of them vote for Giuliani/Schwarzenegger Republicans. Neither are ""small government"" advocates. If they did want lower taxes, they'd immediately have the government's ear: e.g., this is why capital gains remains low.<p>Sad fact is the government listens to wealthy more so than to the poor. This is why some ""progressive"" policies (that mostly benefit the wealthy) get implemented quickly and others (that mostly benefit the less well-of) linger. You can argue that in a theoretical society Internet could be built by free enterprise, cities could be built without eminent domain, etc... but we don't live in this society now. Right now, if you're concerned about government handouts, go after people <i>like me</i> instead of your hypothetical ""$30k/year individual on welfare"".",1358461540

For example, the book recommends, whenever you have a custom manager, always explicitly define `objects` as the default manager, before the custom manager.<p>* The book makes a recommendation; but also mentions alternatives where applicable. The authors prefer a 3 tier project layout but also suggest that a lot of people prefer the 2 tier layout where the `manage.py` is in the root of the repository. Similarly in the chapter on the Class Based Views. The book suggests an approach and also includes other ones.<p>* Includes the latest and the new changes in the django 1.5 wrt the User model and how to inherit.<p>* Recommends and suggests many good third party applications. More books need to do this.<p>* Provides good review material (if you already know) about Security, Deployment, performance etc.<p>All of this, just over the top of my head.<p>Real world advice is often hard to come by.

(And the app is free.)<p>The issue with adding an eraser is that it would add a modality switch to an app that currently has only a single mode: you touch and it draws. If you have various modes, you'll probably end up needing an indicator for which mode you're in (and a cognitive burden, slight though it may be, of this modality). And, if you're gonna have all that, why not also allow various thicknesses of the drawing tool? And colors?<p>There are a million apps that do all those things, and rightly so: lots of people want all those things. But it seems to me that there's room for an app that tries to do what this one is doing, too: ruthlessly trade functionality for simplicity/minimalism. It isn't for everyone or for every use, by any means... but it's at the very least a good experiment.

We did find some performance critical inner loops in our rendering code where we were able to achieve something like 10x speed-ups.<p>Apple's profiler has significantly lower overhead than hookshot - which makes sense given the relative amounts of information collected.  Our app runs noticeably slower when hookshot is enabled, but when it is disabled, hookshot introduces exactly 0 overhead.

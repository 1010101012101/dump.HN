161544,comment,160289,160772,0,0,yters,,,"I think that is partially true based on anecdotal evidence from a friend who tutors students in math.  But still, there seem to be intrinsic differences between the genders in the general nature of their interests.<p>I don't think this is bad.  Women are obviously much smarter than men in certain areas of life and it has been said that behind every great man there is an even better woman.  What needs to happen is for us to realize the mind's quantitative abilities are not the only important aspect of the mind.<p>Anyways, I don't think women should be purposefully kept from quantitative disciplines.  I think the system should be entirely merit based and if women want to be technical then they should do the same work as men.",1207961388

Wall Street decides the market value of public companies, which is in the same ballpark -- but it's a different ball.<p>This would be a tool that businesses would use for market research. Right now large corporations spend billions of dollars hiring economists who study data and tell them what the elasticity of demand is for any given product.<p>This information gives companies a good idea of how much they should charge to maximize revenues. Small businesses don't have access to the data or to money to afford economists. So this tool would provide that service.",1207961360

If the genders naturally have this qualitative vs quantitative distinction in their interests, then the lack of women in quantitative disciplines is a straightforward implication.<p>I can see the problem if women don't naturally have such interests and they're somehow forced to be this way through societal expectations.

161533,comment,161269,161530,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Without knowing the details on the MS deal or the follow on funding, it's hard to say. I would speculate, solely from what I've read, that MS's investment values them at $15 billion while giving them the right to run ads for which they'll have to pay a certain amount as well. So in the case, and assuming other investors also valued them at $15b, that's their actual valuation.",1207960897

The original $15B number comes from an investment that Microsoft did for a share of the company plus advertising consideration.<p>If you just valued the company on the share then it would be worth $15B but since there were other considerations you can't know at all what the valuation was.<p>I've heard of follow-on investments but I never heard any hard facts about the valuation of those investments.<p>On the other hand, I've heard people who should know (actual VCs, TechCrunch, press) say FB has a $15B valuation. I just don't understand how that's the case. Is it bogus or what is the piece of information that I'm missing?",1207960560

If Facebook has also managed to hire someone who can come up with an AdWords-style technology that makes all of those eyeballs staring at Facebook worth more than a few pennies each, Facebook might eventually be worth some of the hype.<p>I've never met Sheryl but I know a lot of the folks that worked directly under her at Google, and they were universally in awe...so, she's probably just the right kind of grownup Zuckerberg needs to have around.",1207960475

161518,comment,161205,161205,0,0,thorax,,,"Very interesting to read the responses here. They aren't at all what I expected to see on this particular site.<p>I personally know two very successful 'exited' entrepreneurs that would never have had their companies acquired if they didn't rack-up an insane amount of bonus miles on those early startup credit cards.<p>My belief is that if you <i>absolutely</i> believe in your startup, you should be willing to get essential funds anywhere legal on reasonable terms, especially if the amounts are in the magnitude of $25,000-30k of debt. Clearly you shouldn't <i>start</i> borrowing on credit cards, but doing some financing on the credit card when things are tight and failure is the only alternative... It's a no brainer to me, and it's part of the reason I've stayed out of debt my entire life, so that I have that extra flexibility if it is ever needed.<p>$25,000 in equity early on is going to cost you a lot more down the line, if you truly believe your startup will be successful.<p>I think it's great to hear people who have learned so solidly not to use credit cards. But when the chips are down, what is an entrepreneur but someone who takes calculated risks for things they believe in?<p>Do what you must to keep your dream alive. If it can't succeed, quit, but if it <i>can</i> and <i>should</i> succeed, a successful entrepreneur will do what they need to do to make it happen. There isn't a ""no"" or ""never"" in that equation.",1207959546

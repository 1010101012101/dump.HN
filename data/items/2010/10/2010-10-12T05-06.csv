1782462,comment,1782230,1782230,0,0,mr_eel,,,"I'm a relatively happy eMusic subscriber -- with a few minor complaints, but nothing serious. I almost see this as a sign of their current business model being unsustainable. eMusic started it's life as a cheap retailer â€”- subscription or no -- but has had to repeatedly rejig their pricing in order to retain label catalogues. I don't think this should be interpreted purely as an attempt to get major labels involved, this has had an effect on smaller labels as well. An anecdotal example; Relapse had pulled it's catalogue purely because it wasn't making enough money from it. Planet-mu had done the same. Subsequent to the last pricing changes, lots of hold out labels have put their catalogues on eMusic -- for me, notably Warp and Kompakt.<p>So my general feeling is that if these moves help eMusic sustain itself, then I can get behind it. However, these pricing schemes no longer look anything like a subscription; eMusic will not be the simple service that it was previously.<p>I get a sense that a subscription now only locks you into paying a set amount each month to a retailer and removes your ability to shop around with that money.<p>Still, the music is generally cheaper and for someone like me -- given I purchase a lot -- it's still a good deal.<p>I watch with interest.",1286862741
1782461,comment,1781643,1781643,0,0,siglesias,,,"This commercial is a bait and switch, and as is common with ads by Crispin Porter & Bogusky, they rely on subtle psychological ploys to effectively influence your thinking.<p>The ad grabs your attention by highlighting the various ways in which society has become addicted to constantly checking information that resides in mobile devices. Several of the scenes deliberately emphasize activities in which another party is left deprived by someone using a phone. The most striking image to me was a father playing see-saw with his daughter, but we also have a game of catch, a neglected wife showing off lingerie, a neglected girlfriend during dinner. The scenes, and their inherent problems, are readily accessible and, importantly, <i>relatable</i> to our every day experiences. Lots of girlfriends in the house are nodding.<p>So now it has seduced you into agreeing with its premise, and you kind of wonder how the commercial proposes to fix it. Cell phones are bad. And then, at the very end, they propose a solution! Yes! We have been waiting for it. The tagline: ""It's time for our phones to save us from our phones. New Windows Phone 7. Designed to get you in, and out, and back to life."" YES! Wait, or is it a solution?<p>If we go back to the original montage building up to the release, the solution, note that what is being highlighted is the TACT of using a phone in particular situations, NOT, as the end implies, some kind of difficult to navigate software that makes information too lengthy a process to access. Have you ever checked email during dinner with a girlfriend on an iPhone or Android? How long does it take to glance at the new messages? 5 seconds? 7 tops? Guess what, she still disapproves. Same with the bedroom situation. If you think about it, the commercial, the first time you see it, seduces you into agreeing with the premise not that the phone takes too long to use, but that it doesn't belong in a bedroom! That it shouldn't be whipped out during a game of catch!<p>In short, the commercial highlights a common problem that it fails to solve. It presents the solution in a grammar that almost solves the problem, but then if you think about it more deeply, utterly fails to solve that problem. Put another way, if Windows Phone 7 does solve the time access problem, the commercial utterly fails to provide any evidence that it succeeds in doing so, because it highlights something else.<p>By not really featuring the product in any substantive way, the ad agency is showing that it can't figure out how to differentiate the product.",1286862729

For a 50k salary, my expenses dropped 4500 a year, nice, but my 200k house just went 20k in the hole as it's now worth only 180k but I still owe 200k. I can throw the entire 4500 savings at paying down the debt, but the net effect is that I'm still down 15.5k; ouch. Debt and deflation do not mix well.<p>What?  No.  The assumption there is that you are going to resell the house.  If your plan is to keep it, then your amortization is still done in nominal terms.  So what, (I know home mortgages are usually 30 years but let's make it 20 with a fixed 5% interest so the math is easy), your annual payment is gonna be 20k without deflation and 20k with deflation.  Backtracking your math...  The person was spending 45k on day to day expenses, so each year was going in the hole  (45 + 20 - 50) = -15k per the first year.  The next year the day to day goes up to 49.5, so 49.5 + 20 - 50 = -19.5k.  Maybe minus a smidgen on the interest...  Too lazy to figure it out.  Nonetheless it's getting worse.<p>With deflation, the first year the person is going -15 k in the hole that first year, and the next year (41.5 + 20 - 50) = -11.5k in the hole the next year.  In a few years the person has a net positive cashflow and that debt (or savings loss) that they accumulated in the first two years will be smoothed over pretty fast.<p>With inflation, why the hell did  someone sell that 200k house to the person, unless there was a crazy idea that the nominal value of the house would monotonically go up at a rate that beats inflation.<p>With deflation, it was probably still a stupid sale, but well at least there's a chance s/he'll pull out of it, if they don't sell the house from under, as indeed the nominal value has gone down.  I feel like home tenancy (versus default, eviction, and turnover) creates for a stabler society, and I'm all for that.<p>Now, if I made a mistake in my math somewhere, let me know.<p>>And in a debt based society-which isn't going to change-continual inflation is the best option.<p>You haven't convinced me of that.  I think continual inflation is the best option <i>if</i> you're a banker.  Or a politician.  The math I've written up above bears out the notion that deflation is good, even for those who are in debt, unless you are really rearing to sell your assets and jump like a hyper meerkat on arbitrage opportunities.  There are reasons why deflation is considered 'bad', namely that it appears to coincide with the loss of jobs, and I think that's mostly because the broad-stroke reason why jobs are lost is because of technology and because technology causes deflation, and indeed, deflation is the mechanism by which technology causes the loss of jobs.",1286860698

Actually, one might argue that adding / to a void tag is an ignored syntax error. The possibility to write it has mostly been added for compatibility reasons and every browser and parser should not handle <br> and <br /> any differently.<p>Google&#x27;s styleguide on that subject is also very clear that you should indeed not close void tags.&quot;",1393509584

I cannot convey the strength of &quot;cultural bonds&quot; with text on a computer screen.<p>As someone from a Nigerian family, we too normally have very strong family bonds. You can&#x27;t just do whatever you want. The closest thing I could compare it to is kinda of like, <i>all</i> your family is considered immediate-family. In the same way you must balance decisions with your spouse you also must consider everyone&#x27;s feelings & wants - Even people who are not logically impacted by your decisions and live 1,000+ miles away.<p>Just throwing away the family network brings you great shame. Yes, pure logic says <i>&quot;Why should I care what a bunch of elders 3,000 miles away think? They know nothing of what I&#x27;m going through.&quot;</i> ...but somehow... you can&#x27;t just do that. It&#x27;s a major part of who you are and breaking those bonds will you empty inside and dishonored by your family(maybe friends too). This is even more the case with women of the culture. It&#x27;s much easier to create an external reason to defy your family like this lady is trying to do - so it looks like <i>&quot;Hey, I tried to do what you told me. Something else got in the way!

There&#x27;s no evidence based on <i>actions</i> that US liberals have a problem with strong police powers; they <i>talk</i> about how bad it is, but monotonically increase the powers, then use them. Conservatives in the US may occasionally grumble about gay people, but they take no action whatsoever to do anything about it, except in very small jurisdictions. The press plays these issues up because it helps the narrative, but they are not a significant force. There is absolutely 0 chance of any sort of &quot;anti-gay&quot; legislation passing through any element of our government right now, and this will most certainly include whoever is elected in a few years.<p>Since US liberalism controls the US media, and broadly speaking fairly leftist elements control the international media as well, you do not tend to get a straight view of what conservatives are and are up to. Mind you, I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;re going to <i>like</i> them if you really knew, but it&#x27;s a very distorted view that you get. In particular, the media carefully seals away anything like a reasonable argument for their positions, and makes sure to play up only dumb ones. For that matter, it is true that it is also a distorted view of US liberalism that you get; you get a lot of the high rhetoric reported, but good luck hearing about their actual actions. (Seriously; watch the news. How much of it is dedicated to politicians just spewing their lines, and how much of it is dedicated to an in-depth report of what&#x27;s actually happening in the field where the policies are being implemented? You may be shocked.)<p>Anyhow, yes, I am reporter on the field with my own slant, but one advantage of not really fitting onto the left/right Republican/Democrat axis is that I get a bit of a clearer view from not having a strong allegiance to either side and psychologically needing to defend &quot;my team&quot;. US &quot;Liberalism&quot; and &quot;Conservatism&quot; have shifted a lot from the core meaning of the term. (Indeed, there&#x27;s a thing called a &quot;Classical Liberal&quot;, if you look it up, and that puts you <i>firmly</i> on the US Conservative side.

Most Webpages with ads aren&#x27;t a commercial and then the content, it&#x27;s the content with the commercials at the periphery of your vision.

If you have any reason to eval it, go ahead, but that would be a bad idea for a log or a config file (unless you want a Turing complete configuration or logging DSL... hopefully you know this is a bad idea!)<p>Most other languages don&#x27;t have an obvious way to just parse a file of source code without actually executing it: `#include <stdio.h>` or `import mycoolpythonlib` or `require __DIR__ . &#x27;/goolib.php&#x27;` both <i>parse</i> and <i>execute/compile/link</i> the file, so yes, any config/log file becomes a code file and &quot;arbitrary code&quot; gets executed, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be this way.<p>(Now, you have things like &quot;import hooks&quot; and access to the AST in Python for example if you want a tree of the imported file, but nothing &quot;simple&quot; and obvious. And this is the thing actually: as much as people consider Lisps too complex and powerful, the nice thing is how &quot;obvious&quot; and &quot;simple&quot; they make things like this - by just parsing sexp tree and manioulating nested lists instead of inventing a file format like XML with its transformation languages, query languages and so on, and all the tools to support them, and all the man-years (or is it decades? ...centuries?) spend to code and maintain them ...just think how much needless effort could have been spared.)",1393507106

No more stanza files, apache-config, .properties files, XML configuration files, Makefiles — all those lame, crappy, half-language creatures that you wish were executable, or at least loaded directly into your program without specialized processing. I know, I know — everyone raves about the power of separating your code and your data. That&#x27;s because they&#x27;re using languages that simply can&#x27;t do a good job of representing data as code. But it&#x27;s what you really want, or all the creepy half-languages wouldn&#x27;t all evolve towards being Turing-complete, would they?&quot;<p>This touches on the core problem with the whole Java ecosystem.  The existence of so many tools demonstrates, first, that the underlying technology is insufficiently expressive and, second, that many programmers would rather create tools than applications.<p>Leaving the second aside, the kinds of tools required for Java development are largely unnecessary in the Lisp world because the language itself is expressive and extensible.  You don&#x27;t need different representations for data and code, separate parsers, and frankly bizarre build systems (<i>cough</i>maven<i>cough</i>).<p>As ESR, I believe, said &quot;Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it.&quot;  Unfortunately, it also makes you more aware that things don&#x27;t have to be as bad as they are in the Java world.<p>Hopefully s-expressions will be the next aspect of Lisp rediscovered in &quot;modern&quot; programming languages.",1393507013

Some engineers considered it feasible to repair the hole in the wing using material scavenged from Columbia [1] but this was apparently considered very high-risk. The shuttle re-entered at Mach 25 and the leading-edges of the wings were made from titanium because of the extreme thermal and aerodynamic stresses they were subject to, so stuffing  a tile (assuming it could be removed, which would have been unlikely) into the hole wouldn&#x27;t have helped at all.<p>Some repair techniques and tools were developed part of the process of returning the shuttle fleet to flight after the loss of Columbia. These included a caulk-gun to allow in-situ repairs to thermal tiles [2] and a device for plugging holes in leading surfaces such as the wings.

I sometimes even quote a little high because I know I&#x27;m really rubbish at doing estimates, and it hasn&#x27;t got better in time. You know other people are going to be late with key information and decisions, and there will be somethings that you miss when you first quote, but keep communicating with your clients and alert them early when things don&#x27;t go to plan, and most people will be fine - and the rest you probably don&#x27;t want to work with anyway.",1393506661

Dating sites have a similar challenge, in that feedback on interactions (&quot;how did the date go&quot;) are rarely collected.  As opposed to YouTube where a huge signal is &quot;did the user stay on the page for the duration of the entire video&quot;.  If I watch 5 seconds of a 3 minute video (or 30 seconds of a 60 minute vid), odds are I wasn&#x27;t very impressed.<p>There&#x27;s also the challenge of sorting out abuse of moderation systems, particularly those trying to get legitimate (but unpopular) voices banned or restricted.<p>The good news is that there are some people whose interactions are so widely negative (spammers and trolls) that you can attack them head on and reduce the cost coefficient significantly (recognizing that the cost constant is constructed of both a specific value <i>and</i> the number of connections).  Spam is as annoying as it is because a single spammer affects so many other users.<p>The flipside is that you can increase the network value by finding people others <i>really</i> want to connect with.  Here I see G+ as being horribly naive (also YouTube) in <i>repeatedly making recommendations that I&#x27;m absolutely not interested in</i>, without offering me an opportunity to say &quot;don&#x27;t show me this person&quot; or &quot;don&#x27;t show me this product / video / category&quot; ever, ever again.  One of my long-standing challenges to the &quot;deep data&quot; (snooping) perspective is:  rather than compile a massive dossier on my and attempt to bother me by way of it, <i>when you do find me in an intentional mood to find something, get really good at figuring out whether you&#x27;re offering me what I want or not</i>.  Why Google should know my location to within 2 feet every 60 seconds of the past five years ... but not be able to tell me the dot pitch of the monitor I&#x27;m shopping for, strikes me as a stunningly obtuse mismatch of data focus.<p>That said:  yes, the ability to dismiss stuff I don&#x27;t want to see and be bothered with is absolutely useful.  As I&#x27;d repeatedly said at G+:  let me say &quot;not now&quot;, &quot;not this hour&quot;, &quot;not today / this week / month&quot; (essentially:  timeouts).  And of course &quot;not ever&quot;.  G+&#x27;s blocking feature is also grossly inadequate.  Some people, yes, I simply don&#x27;t want to deal with.

The best way to do this is to figure out a clients return on investment when hiring you.

This is akin to filming someone doing something wholly innocent and then dubbing it with hate speech without asking them if that&#x27;s ok.<p>There&#x27;s a strong argument that this is art, and consequently worth protecting to enshrine freedom of expression, but at the same time I can&#x27;t imagine many people would be happy if they were the one in the film. I&#x27;d argue that it&#x27;s not far from defamation as far as the actor is concerned.",1393506065

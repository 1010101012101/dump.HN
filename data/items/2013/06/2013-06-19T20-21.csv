That&#x27;s actually not a goal, that&#x27;s just someones cynical view of a potential side-effect when trying to invent a new more productive language for the web without JS deficiencies, with better language semantics, faster start-up and predictable run-time performance.<p>In Lars and Kasper Google I/O talk, they explain that V8 has become an extremely complex code-base, now weighing more than 500k LOC, with advanced compiler tricks to achieve the leading performance it currently has. The V8 designers think they&#x27;re nearing the max performance ceiling possible with JS where it&#x27;s unlikely they&#x27;ll be able to get a further 2x perf improvement: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huawCRlo9H4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huawCRlo9H4</a><p>Which is in contrast to Dart which was developed with the input of VM engineers, is a much smaller and simpler code-base that is able to support proper classes, real integers and SIMD support which is already capable of delivering 10x faster startup times (with snapshots) and 2x faster and more predictable runtime performance which is still in beta and has yet to receive anywhere near the engineering effort V8 has.<p>Google is big enough to attempt 2 competing strategies to improve web development and performance, i.e. a faster JavaScript being led by the Standards committee that&#x27;s enhancing JavaScript at a comittees pace and by introducing a completely new language for the web built from the ground up to be faster, structured and more consistent: <a href=""http://infrequently.org/2011/09/google-the-future-of-javascript/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://infrequently.org/2011/09/google-the-future-of-javascr...</a>",1371675563

5908161,comment,5907999,5907999,11,0,eridius,,,"The page is loading really slowly, so here&#x27;s the text:<p>Last week at E3, the excitement, creativity and future of our industry was on display for a global audience.<p>For us, the future comes in the form of Xbox One, a system designed to be the best place to play games this year and for many years to come. As is our heritage with Xbox, we designed a system that could take full advantage of advances in technology in order to deliver a breakthrough in game play and entertainment. We imagined a new set of benefits such as easier roaming, family sharing, and new ways to try and buy games. We believe in the benefits of a connected, digital future.<p>Since unveiling our plans for Xbox One, my team and I have heard directly from many of you, read your comments and listened to your feedback. I would like to take the opportunity today to thank you for your assistance in helping us to reshape the future of Xbox One.<p>You told us how much you loved the flexibility you have today with games delivered on disc. The ability to lend, share, and resell these games at your discretion is of incredible importance to you. Also important to you is the freedom to play offline, for any length of time, anywhere in the world.<p>So, today I am announcing the following changes to Xbox One and how you can play, share, lend, and resell your games exactly as you do today on Xbox 360. Here is what that means:<p>An internet connection will not be required to play offline Xbox One games  After a one-time system set-up with a new Xbox One, you can play any disc based game without ever connecting online again. There is no 24 hour connection requirement and you can take your Xbox One anywhere you want and play your games, just like on Xbox 360.<p>Trade-in, lend, resell, gift, and rent disc based games just like you do today  There will be no limitations to using and sharing games, it will work just as it does today on Xbox 360.<p>In addition to buying a disc from a retailer, you can also download games from Xbox Live on day of release. If you choose to download your games, you will be able to play them offline just like you do today. Xbox One games will be playable on any Xbox One console -- there will be no regional restrictions.<p>These changes will impact some of the scenarios we previously announced for Xbox One. The sharing of games will work as it does today, you will simply share the disc. Downloaded titles cannot be shared or resold. Also, similar to today, playing disc based games will require that the disc be in the tray.<p>We appreciate your passion, support and willingness to challenge the assumptions of digital licensing and connectivity. While we believe that the majority of people will play games online and access the cloud for both games and entertainment, we will give consumers the choice of both physical and digital content. We have listened and we have heard loud and clear from your feedback that you want the best of both worlds.<p>Thank you again for your candid feedback. Our team remains committed to listening, taking feedback and delivering a great product for you later this year.",1371675402

However, these possibilities are still only marginally used. We argue for the implementation of (1) peer-reviewed peer review, (2) transparent editorial hierarchies, and (3) online data publication. First, peer-reviewed peer review entails a community-wide review system in which reviews are published online and rated by peers. This ensures accountability of reviewers, thereby increasing academic quality of reviews. Second, reviewers who write many highly regarded reviews may move to higher editorial positions. Third, online publication of data ensures the possibility of independent verification of inferential claims in published papers. This counters statistical errors and overly positive reporting of statistical results. We illustrate the benefits of these strategies by discussing an example in which the classical publication system has gone awry, namely controversial IQ research. We argue that this case would have likely been avoided using more transparent publication practices. We argue that the proposed system leads to better reviews, meritocratic editorial hierarchies, and a higher degree of replicability of statistical analyses.&quot;<p>The practices recommended in Wicherts&#x27;s article would have made an incident like the earlier retraction from Nature reported here much less likely to be necessary in the first place.",1371675119

You do not need to be in &quot;Save the World!&quot; mode at all times.<p>> Homelessness is a problem for the homeless. Homeless people sleeping on the buses are a problem for commuters.<p>Disagreed. Homelessness is a problem for everyone. While homeless people exist, they will necessarily cause problems for the rest of the society. Here are my takes on it:<p>1. Homelessness is a spot in society. If you take all the non-homeless people in your community and move to a brand new piece of land that is completely isolated from the rest of the world, new homeless people will appear. This is because being homeless is inherent to certain societal setups and the percentage of homeless population can be determined &quot;at compile time&quot; via static analysis of the rules and initial state of the society.<p>2. The homeless/poor/hungry are a problem for everyone and everyone pays the cost. It is rarely direct (e.g.: not everyone gets mugged), but often indirect. For example, your car or renter&#x27;s or homeowner&#x27;s insurance is higher. You have to pay for a security guard in your apartment building. You have to pay for your bus ticket. You have to buy a more expensive bike chain.<p>3. Given #1 and #2, it is in everyone&#x27;s best interest to solve the problems of homelessness/poverty/hunger.<p>I am not saying that we should drop everything and not stop until it is solved. I am saying that it should be a pretty high priority and that the question of whether we tackle it should be &quot;yes&quot;.",1371674817

The society in 1984 is very similar to real-world society at the time; the only real differences are the ubiquity of government propaganda, rationing of resources, the state-sanctioned class system, and telescreens, and even all of these are already present in lesser ways and could conceivably be intensified to 1984 levels in five or ten years. I frequently experience things that are virtually identical to events in 1984 (e.g. government lies that society immediately accepts, people regurgitating pro-government phrases that are hammered into children&#x27;s brains in public school, justifications for war and militarism, demonization of political dissidents, the newly-prominent surveillance, etc.).<p>The society in A Brave New World is a dystopian science fiction fantasy world that is a far cry from any society that has ever existed.<p>I think both books are good and offer important warnings to society, but 1984 is simply a much more grounded and realistic view of a conceivable totalitarian state in the near future.",1371674804

5907940,comment,5903868,5907841,1,0,gfodor,,,"When did I say all possible outcomes are equal? The <i>most likely</i> scenario is not a sudden explosion of yields but a gradual increase in yields. Other possible scenarios are low yields for much longer than you expect, or your &quot;armageddon&quot; scenario where yields jump by a few hundred basis points in a year or something. If you don&#x27;t believe central banks can keep rates low for another decade in the U.S. see: Japan. (Don&#x27;t assume I am claiming this is a good idea, I am just explaining the reality of the incredible leverage central banking has.)<p>If you buy a 10% discounted tax free bond fund (a taxable equivalent of a 9% yield currently) that has medium duration (~6 years) then you are fairly well cushioned from gradually rising yields, as the fund turns over and moves into higher yield bonds your distributions should increase. In other words, all of your fears are not hidden, secret, insider knowledge, but are largely getting priced in at this point.<p>The biggest risk with long-term CEF muni bond holdings is not interest rate risk (since you don&#x27;t have to sell them, you have a 10% cushion, they have moderate duration, and a large enough spike in yields to really impair your principal is a pretty low probability outcome. but again: you don&#x27;t have to sell them.) The real risk is inflation risk. And this is what I said in the Disclaimer:, which you seemed to not read. Also, your viewpoint seems to indicate the best assets to hold are gold and cash, and the cash side of your portfolio is going to be exposed to the same inflation risk as your bond coupons. There&#x27;s also risk of default, but you can find national funds that are well diversified, etc, so this doesn&#x27;t seem to serious a concern either.<p>edit: Also, one thing you are overlooking is that if the shit hits the fan, there is a lot of greedy, borrowed money in equities right now, both people chasing dividend yield and people chasing capital gains now that we&#x27;re in a bull market, thanks to the Fed&#x27;s bubble, that will head for the exits. It will go where it always goes: government backed fixed income and money markets. This will cause downward pressure on yields in the scenario where Fed moves cause a panic in the stock market, even though ironically the Fed doesn&#x27;t even buy equities, it only buys bonds.",1371673406

There is an overwhelmingly mainstream misconception that our modern western use of rationality and empiricism is inherent to human thought- in reality, it isn&#x27;t even universally applicable to our own &quot;enlightened society&quot;.<p>One of the climaxes of the novel is when Winston finally believes that 2+2=5, and he does so  because Big Brother says it is so. In general, we tend to believe that belief is something which must inherently rise out of empiricism; all of us reading this believe 2+2=4 because we have seen and understood the mathematical and logical reasoning behind this. However, the spectrum from daily emotional irrationality to politics to religion tells us that human beings do <i>not</i> base a large number of their beliefs in empirical reasoning, but in something unscientific entirely.<p>Thus, the most important part, in my opinion, of 1984 is not about authoritarian censorship or surveillance, but rather the creation of a delusional society. This is also, even in light of the recent scandals, far more applicable to our society today, when modern conservativism is both willing to be ignorant of scientific and social evidence, and willing to lie to the degree that they have believed their own lies.",1371673021

How biased is the research? etc.<p>Prisons in general are bad for society. Prison stays are highly deleterious to people and the communities they will return to. Non-violent crimes should certainly not result in prison time, there is no productive reason for that to happen. Property crimes (e.g. theft) are come about from how society is structured and we would be better off addressing social inequality than investing in increasing incarceration. Violent crimes may be better handled with systems that are structurally different from the current prison system.<p>> 2) More importantly, regardless of whether they are private or public prisons, how do we get less people to be living in them? What are our other options?<p>War on drugs must end. Social inequality with regards to poverty and homelessness need to be seriously tackled. Racism and sexism need to be addressed from a systemic aspect.

Such is not the case; not even remotely the case.<p>Rates cannot stay at 0% for the next 10 years, the math involved won&#x27;t allow for that scenario. The Fed is already having their hand forced right now, as is easily demonstrated by the huge spike in bond yields, oil being at $100, housing and stock prices skyrocketing due to asset inflation generated intentionally by the Fed (as they openly said they wanted to have happen). It&#x27;s a repeat of the last asset bubbles they brewed, and for exactly the same reasons, only this time it&#x27;s 100% intentional. The clock is rapidly running out on their fraudulent game. They&#x27;re already being wedged between a rock and a hard place; continue the policies of cheap money, and assets go so high they rip the economy apart upon implosion, again; stop the policies, and the economy implodes instantly. Rates skyrocket either way, as the bond buyers begin demanding higher yields to compensate for worsening inflation with continued QE; or rates skyrocket as the Fed stops QE and stops artificially holding down rates.<p>You might as well claim that rates can stay at 0% forever, or for 1,000 years, or for 100 years. Again, your position requires the premise that all outcomes are equally possible, and that is not true.<p>It&#x27;s obvious the era of cheap money is ending.

I happen to live in Colorado, and I&#x27;d love to use our products to help with forest fires, but the FAA won&#x27;t let us.<p>Of course, any tool can be abused.

What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egotism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny &quot;failed to take into account man&#x27;s almost infinite appetite for distractions.&quot; In 1984, Orwell added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we fear will ruin us. Huxley feared that our desire will ruin us.</i><p>~ Neil Postman",1371672012

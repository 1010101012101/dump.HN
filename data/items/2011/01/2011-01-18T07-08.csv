The real issue (as stated elsewhere) is that you are using something for which you are required to provide recompense. Avoid that recompense is depriving the distributor.<p>While the semantics of ""is it theft"" does have a slight relevance, the overhead of how this concept completely derails the legitimate debate is far worse. Theft or not, it's an issue that needs to be addressed, and the ""it's not theft"" folks always seem to want to avoid addressing it.<p>A bit like how those folks who always say ""but information wants to be free / you can't stop it"" never want to divulge their bank account details and passwords...",1295337420

However, unlike any (at least, most) other self-declared prophets Kurzweil has a solid history of predictions going back at least 21 years. While of course not all of the things he has said have come to pass, or they come to pass at slightly different time periods, more than not they have been spot on.<p>Of course, some nutcases really <i>do</i> subscribe to The Singularity as a faith. These people don't pay attention to the various sub-disciplines of biology, computer science, and materials science that are among the core fields generally related to The Singularity.<p>Folks like myself who think that something like TS is ahead of us base our reasoning on the rapid advances that humanity is making in the core fields, not on some religious belief.

2115032,comment,2114354,2114796,0,0,malkia,,,"Actually it helped me realize certain things in other libs.<p>For example using std::<pair> more after spending time with Common Lisp.<p>Also it made me realized that certain building blocks, patterns, etc. are not that great when looked through a different view.<p>For example the ""factory"" pattern is needed in C++, because objects can be allocated on the stack... Wait... what?<p>Well, because C++ allows allocation of objects on the stack, obviously one cannot think in it, as if ""new"" would've returned object with different size than the one declared. e.g. ""new SomeClass()"" is known by the compiler how much space would take, hence ""SomeClass someObject;"" is known in advance and can be allocated on the stack. Cool, isn't.... Actually not so cool - because of that you can't return proxied objects, hidden implementation, etc... Hence you need factory - instead of ""new SomeClass"" -> CreateSomeClass() function that might return object of different size... Where I got aware of this - by spending some time with Objective C and it's objects.<p>Then comes the holly OOP, especially the C++ way - but then one discovers lua, javascript... Or Common Lisp... and understands - ""protected"", ""private"" are not that important, and the GOF patterns are not that needed.<p>Okay, so you go back at your work to code in C++, and just take it easier, because you have realized there is no point going hard-core and doing it the C++ way all the time. Hell it's even okay to have this macro called ""HASHED( ""SomeGameResource"", 0x123123 )"" that... gets preprocessed by external tool, that replaces 0x123123 with the hash code of ""SomeGameResource"" and puts it back in the source code.<p>#ifdef DEBUG<p>#define HASHED(s,c) hashed(s) // e.g. call function in debug to return the hash-code<p>#else<p>#define HASHED(s,c) c // replaced with the precalculated value<p>#endif<p>Now try doing that with templates.... But my point is - there is no need - just use an external tool that does it for you. Inform your programmers that if they want to change HASHED(""BlahBlah"", 0x123123) to HASHED(""BlahBlah2"", 0x123123) then they have to run it through a tool (or have such step), or just make them use the debug version.

2115030,comment,2114928,2114928,0,0,swombat,,,"Whilst I agree with he author that there are religious aspects to the whole Singularity with a capital S movement, it seems to me his arguments are equally unsound.<p>First of all, this is not an attack on the singularity idea, but on the ""strong AI"" idea.<p>With respect to strong AI, Nick is very close to the problem, and that's the issue. Like any good engineer/scientist, he sees problems everywhere. Yes, there are many problems before we get to strong AI. That's not news. There were many problems to resolve before people could pay a small sum of money and let a giant metal tube take them through the air to a destination halfway round the world without killing them - but those problems got resolved, one by one. Many problems do not amount to an impossibility, only a damn hard problem (which we knew strong AI was anyway).<p>As for his other assertion, that the concept of the singularity is a fantasy, Nick's main argument is that the singularity will only last ""for a time"", and that it will turn into a classic S-curve. He waves Feynman's name around as supporting evidence, but does not address the fact that intelligence (and artificial intelligence in particular) is not subject to the Malthusian laws which have caused other phenomena to follow S-curves. Yes, we only have access to so many particles, but the whole point of exponential AI is figuring out better ways to use the same number of particles. There may be a theoretical limit to how efficiently we can use those particles, but even so there are a lot of particles, and if we can manufacture even just human-equivalent computing matter in factories, that's already enough to achieve a singularity.<p>So, in summary:<p>- Yes, there is a problem with Singularity stuff being quasi-religious (I've been to a Singularity event and agree - though the proportion of kooks was relatively low, there were certainly a few, some of them on the podium speaking)<p>- No, this article is not a convincing argument against either strong AI or the potential of a singularity-like event to occur.",1295336717

Yet my site never got drooled over on Hacker News or Tech Crunch (possibly because I never submitted it to either), and I never had all these people telling me how great I am, how awesome my idea was, and sounding so sure that it will make me rich.<p>My site has 10x more users than threewords.me, been cloned by many developers in various countries around the globe, and still retains the top spot among those competitors. In fact, it seems that I actually invented a new genre of games with my idea (how many people get to say they invented Tetris, FPS, RTS, RPG, or MMO?)<p>All this, and yet I'm still barely making more from the site than I could be making from working at McDonald's. Yet I persist. It's been my full-time job for the past 3 years (the web app, not McDonalds :)), ever since I parted ways with my well-salaried software engineering job.<p>If anyone is tempted to call me stupid or lazy for not making millions from my idea, I'll be the first to admit that maybe I am. I didn't do any marketing or emailing Arrington, or any of the like. Instead I've been focused on building what my users want, developing features, fighting fires, and talking to users (many of whom constantly criticize me for not pushing out new feature fast enough).<p>Not a single real user ever said to me ""Wow, this will make you rich,"" it's always more like ""Wow, I LOVE your game! Please add features X, Y, and Z. They are super important! Hope to see X, Y, and Z working soon!""<p>Therefore, I sometimes think the startup community needs a dose of sanity. Not every tiny app is going to make millions. The web economy seems like a gold rush for many.  If threewords.me makes any real money from this sale, it will be due to the exposure it's received to people participating in that gold rush.<p>In conclusion, I'd like to say that my comments are not intended just for criticism.  If any of you think you know how you could make tons of money from threewords.me or from a casual MMO game (that doesn't have any virtual goods to sell), then I hope you can tell us how you would do it, rather than making assumptions that somehow anyone can get rich by building a free app and getting several hundred thousand people to sign up for it.<p>(P.S. Mark, I think you're a great guy and your app is very nice, so please don't take my comments the wrong way - I'm just trying to add some perspective to this discussion.)",1295335725

That the Wivenhoe was and is used for both is not a surprise, particularly after the droughts leading up to 2008, but the flooding raises serious questions about how sensible that would be in future.<p>That said, the Wivenhoe in this case did precisely what it was meant to do, and those who operated it did an admirable job under extremely trying circumstances, IMHO.  It simply wasn't designed to cope with the volumes of rainfall that occurred, afaict.<p>I hope the forthcoming inquiry will not focus so much on the smaller-scale ""tactical"" decisions that led up to the flooding (it will be news to nobody if it turns out some mistakes were made: I'm sure there were), but more on the state's water management strategy as a whole.  Unfortunately the news reporting I've seen so far has already tended towards the former.<p>It's water management strategy that has failed SE Queensland <i>twice</i> in the last few years: first when the water nearly ran out after the drought, and now only two years later there's too much water by half.

2114964,comment,2110756,2113163,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"Look, the ""not nice to try to fool Mother Nature"" is easy to understand and nothing to object to:  We just admit that we do not know all about women.  You'll go along with that, right?  If you do actually know all about women, then hurry up and tell the rest of us!  In the meanwhile, clearly likely that stuff we don't understand has effects.  So, as we try to understand what's happening, there are effects from stuff we don't understand.  So, a simple, intuitive description is that, in what we don't understand, we are fighting against 'Mother Nature'.<p>If you want a little more, got to tell you, the deeper you look into the behavior of women, the more surprising stuff you find.  It is as if the woman with the characteristics we would find ideal for computer science, business, etc. now DID exist 20,000 years ago but is just not one of our ancestors.  So, chalk this up to ""Mother Nature was there long before computer science."".<p>It's actually not very difficult.<p>Here's another point easy to see:  Take a women of Western European descent and one of Japanese descent.  Look at them and find things in their 'personalities' that they share and that are particular to women.  So, in these ways these two women look close.<p>Now we can get an intuitive view of how strong those ways are, that is, in how long they have been strongly in the gene pool.  The simple answer is:  May I have the envelop please.  And the answer is, 40,000 years.<p>Here's how that works:  The evidence is that humans walked out of Africa and at about 40,000 years ago reached, say, Iran or some such.  Then one branch went to Western Europe and another branch went to China and, then, to Japan.  So for those two women we started with, their youngest common woman ancestor is about 40,000 years old.<p>I claim that common ancestor was a LOT like what those two women have in common, and here's how that goes:  Pick, say, the woman of Western European descent, go backwards in time in her tree, noting all the changes, to the common ancestor and then go forward in time in the tree of the Japanese woman, again noting all the changes, to the woman of Japanese descent.  Now note that all these changes don't add up to much change, and the common ancestor has fewer changes and, thus, is closer to each of the two modern women than they are to each other.<p>So what you see in common in women in Western Europe and Japan has to go WAY back, at least 40,000 years (unless what is in common developed independently, which we have to assume is very rare).  So, those common things have changed very slowly.<p>In particular, when we are looking a modern women, we are looking at at least some characteristics that worked at least 40,000 years ago.  So, when we are guessing at what Mother Nature has in women, some of it, maybe a lot of it, is really old.  So, we can expect surprises from 40,000 years ago, and simple models of how women work and what they can do or are happy doing need not work.  In particular, the simple view that, ""Of course, women can do well in computer science and be happy doing it"" doesn't have to hold; there can be reasons 40,000 years old we don't understand that can block us.  Net, in simple terms, Mother Nature was there a long time ago, and what she has in the genes it's ""not nice to try to fool"" with.  So, be CAREFUL.<p>You 'get it' now, right?<p>Now hurry up and write us that book that explains all about women.",1295334690

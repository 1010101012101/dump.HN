But not for every situation.<p><i>Do we really believe that the big consulting companies or banks don't know how to filter for the better candidates given how much their business depends purely on having the smartest people?</i><p>Consultancies like interviewing because they are looking for <i>clay candidates</i>. Workloads are inconsistent and variable; the skills required are generally learned on the job in real-time, so optimum candidates are those who are adaptable and can be molded into many shapes. Optimum employees can look smart while work long hours in small teams, so the hiring criteria are simple: 1)  a good GPA 2) whether your interviewer likes you or not. These are factors you can get from an interview (or five).<p>However a lot of companies are looking for <i>diamond candidates</i>. Diamond candidates are functional hires; those who are very good at what they do, Erlang Ninjas or Ruby Rockstars. These companies are trying to find a specific skill set or a 'brilliant mind' which will complete/compliment their current working profile. Interviewing <i>diamond candidates</i> is useless.<p>I'd guess that the vast majority of firings are not due to incompetence. They are due to disconnects; cultural, vision, personality, whatever. A diamond candidate is tough to interview for these disconnects. By virtue of their technical ability, their fit is usually downplayed or compromised in an attempt to nab 'the best programming team' or the 'most visionary CEO'. This is why so many companies think that interviewing sucks. They're just looking for the wrong things.<p>tl;dr Interviews work for hiring people, not functions.",1305571703

You can easily build complex iterative lazy structures as well as all the ordinary things like for-loops, function calls etc using the same basic structures.<p>It's a similar idea, in many ways, to the way Javascript does objects: run some code get a map back. Where it gets interesting is that you can choose to use the evaluated value and the scope that was generated in evaluating it. Objects, maps, code, scope, closures and lazy evaluation become the same thing: you declare a block of code, you evaluate it into a closure (with scope and a stack) you query it for results, rinse-repeat.<p>A for-loop becomes a function that takes two blocks: one that lazily generates values in and one that lazily consumes them. It is the two closures that remember their state - not the for-loop function. The 'for-function' just passes the current value to the second block to use it.<p>Javascript, REBOL and Lua do have these capabilities but none have the elegance (nor simplicity) of Lisp.

(not that\n  > that is particularly difficult)\n</code></pre>\nMy point was not that Java is/can be as concise as Clojure (or Ruby or Python or some other version of Java or whatever) but that if you are focusing on comparing things, don't use examples that are so easy to write off.  It is not clear to me, as a person experienced with Java but not with Clojure, that the Clojure method deals with many types of character sequences, nor is it clear to me that it's faster or slower than a regex match.  If the argument solely lies on lines of code, my mind will think ""is he comparing code optimized for performance from one language to code optimized for conciceness from another?""  Is that ability to traverse sequences some bona-fide intelligence on the languages part or just a mess of instanceof expressions that really only work for a few expressions?<p>This just struck me because I've been evaluating a lot of languages lately (Clojure is up soon) and it's frustrating to wade through people talking about languages using examples that are ignorant of all but their own, or contrived solely to make a point.  Demonstrate the language in how powerful it is, how efficiently it runs, how gracefully it handles errors, how many lines of code it takes to solve specific problems, not standard utility  ones that could easily be tucked into some library somewhere and it doesn't really matter if its 2 lines or 20.",1305569430

You would at least have to check which list is longer, no?<p><i>But if you have some sort of known relationship between the lengths of the lists...</i><p>Special cases often enable better optimizations, but I'm asking about the general case.<p>So I guess the answer is that one can't use these types to implement the standard zip.

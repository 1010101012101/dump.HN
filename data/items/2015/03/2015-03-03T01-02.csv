Change your mental attitude and you stop the negative feedback loop, allowing recovery to occur.<p>This theory appears to me to be:<p>- Based on many unproven assumptions and leaps of logic around HPA-axis involvement.<p>- Based on inherently biased recovery reports that could be due to spontaneous recovery (which you mention) as much as anything.<p>- Results in an unfalsifiable theory that blames patients for their continued suffering (people can recover if they change their attitude/lifestyle; if they don&#x27;t, they mustn&#x27;t have changed their attitude/lifestyle).<p>This is not scientific. Theories around HPA-axis involvement are a dime a dozen. Theories around changing your lifestyle/attitude resulting in a &quot;cure&quot; are simplistic and patronising to the many, many sufferers who have done just that, and not seen the cure you say is possible for all patients.<p>CFS patients get sick of this sort of thing because it seems to be the proponents of psycho-social approaches with faulty beliefs and poor logic -- not the patients -- that leads to unfalsifiable, unscientific theories being promoted to very sick, very vulnerable people, who you say could be cured, if only they stopped with their gosh darn negative attitudes and poor lifestyle choices!<p>You need better evidence than anecdotes from mass media and a hand-wavvy physiological/psychological explanation to make such grandiose claims.<p>Please consider re-evaluating your own beliefs in light of the much broader evidence. For example, a positive attitude and lifestyle change are the driving forces for many CFS patients that leads them on decade+ journeys attempting to right the ship, only to find improvement fleeting at best.<p>While some people may spontaneously recover along the way, confusing correlation for causation, and painting a minority of psychological cases as reflective of the whole is unhelpful and, honestly, could do with a large serving of humility and more research about those that haven&#x27;t recovered before you make grand claims about &quot;recovery in all cases&quot; based on mental attitudes and lifestyle changes.<p>Again, what patients need is real research from the scientific and medical establishments, not hand-savvy, victim-blaming theories from armchair internet experts.",1425345063

Nevertheless, there was a shared sense that additional research would be valuable on methods for understanding and verifying the range of behaviors of complex computational systems to minimize unexpected outcomes. Some panelists recommended that more research needs to be done to better define “intelligence explosion,” and also to better formulate different classes of such accelerating intelligences. Technical work would likely lead to enhanced understanding of the likelihood of such phenomena, and the nature, risks, and overall outcomes associated with different conceived variants.&quot;<p>Stanford’s One-Hundred Year Study of Artificial Intelligence includes “Loss of Control of AI systems” as an area of study, specifically highlighting concerns over the possibility that:<p>&quot;we could one day lose control of AI systems via the rise of superintelligences that do not act in accordance with human wishes – and that such powerful systems would threaten humanity.

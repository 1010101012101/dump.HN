A strobe would be synced up with the valve, and light up the droplets of water falling to the ground. By carefully timing the strobe you could make it appear that the droplets were falling upwards into the tap. It looked really cool.<p>Great fun - got me laid too :-)",1200768766

100950,comment,100319,100360,0,0,a-priori,,,"I chose to join my current startup precisely <i>because</i> of the moral implications. It's a ""change the world"" (i.e, the real world) kind of an idea, the linchpin of which is technology-based. I wish I say more about it than that, but we're hush-hush about it for the time being.<p>It's interesting that I'm not alone here, that other founders here (YC-funded or otherwise -- we're not) also aim to improve the world somehow with their companies.<p>I saw an article recently in the WSJ [1] about how young people now are more philanthropic than previous generations. Whereas in the past, philanthropy was the domain of the rich (think Andrew Carnegie), the Internet now allows individuals, even children, to each contribute effectively in small ways. Combined together in large numbers, these small contributions can be significant.<p>Of course, I'm not only talking about money here. By ""contribute"", I also mean knowledge (e.g, Wikipedia), resources (e.g, OLPC ""buy one get one""), and so on. The ""new philanthropy"" is all about the sum of small, individual contributions. I think this trend in the startups around here are part of this.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118765256378003494.html?mod=hps_us_editors_picks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118765256378003494.html?mod=...</a>",1200768407

I don't know what it means in the real world, or how I could test for it, or what would be different if it did or didn't exist, and neither does anyone else. I don't know why people spend so much energy squabbling about it.<p>At least consciousness (which Dennett might but in the same category... something that affects _precisely_ nothing) is something I can experience.",1200767985

Judging by the list of points that Aaron provides and Dennett's other books, I bet Dennett's actual point was to say: 'Look, this is <i>plausible</i>, and you can't dismiss it out of hand. Yes, obviously the data still needs to come in to determine whether this is the <i>actual</i> truth, but you shouldn't consider it a foregone conclusion that this isn't a valid option.'<p>Here's some ""primary source"" Dennett material in contrast to Aaron's angry ""tertiary source"" rant: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=101017"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=101017</a>

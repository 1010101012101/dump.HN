It is similar to the difference between a shy introverted person with few friends and an outgoing extroverted person with many friends. A great salesman could take the introvert and get them used to more social interaction. The introvert could learn about all kinds of social cues and ways to connect with people in any situation. So then you say that there is no difference between an introvert and an extrovert - look at how many friends the introvert has now!<p>There are many people in this world that don't use analysis and logic in the same way that programmers do.

A <i>programmer</i> can be nearly anyone with some basic skills, but a <i>hacker</i> is a fundamentally different animal from the rest of the general population.  The hacker doesn't even necessarily have to be better than the bulk of his non-hacker, regular programmer, peers (though I imagine you'll often find that to be the case) because it's not about skill, it's about mindset.<p>It's certainly not limited to programming either of course.  I would likely consider a career electrician who moonlights as a coiler (of telsa coils) to be a hacker.

2107218,comment,2106944,2106944,0,0,duairc,,,"This is obvious.<p>I mean isn't it basically a fluke that we all ended up as programmers? I don't I'd think be half as interested in computers as I am if my dad didn't bring us home a computer when I was 3 or 4, or if my grandmother didn't randomly get me a book about ""How to make your own website"" for my tenth birthday. She didn't get me this because I'd shown a particular interest in computers, it was just one book among a bunch of books ""for boys"", most of the rest of which were about football. So the relationship between the society in which I grew up and the gender it assigned me at birth also contributed to my becoming a programmer, and definitely in more ways than just being the reason I got that book. I also happened to be lucky enough to participate in a programme for ""talented"" kids, and one of the courses they offered was in programming (they taught me Java when I was 13), and I was able to use the skills I learnt from that to pick up Javascript and PHP (for my website). Then one of my older cousins introduced me to Linux, and that kind of paved the way for me becomming a ""real"" programmer, when I started writing little programs to make my life easier in Linux.<p>And it was basically luck that all of those things happened, and happened at the right times in my life so that they all had the effect that they did. I might have ended up doing something completely different if, for example, my parents weren't able to afford to send me on that course at which I learnt how to program properly. I became a programmer because certain things happened at certain times in my life to make me interested in programming and to give me to means to pursue that interest. Luck was the reason that those things happened to me, not the way I think or because I somehow have a magical programmer brain that made me destined to program. That's obviously absurd. Those things could have happened to anybody. Everybody can be a programmer. We're not better than everybody else.",1295109885

Was their ambition to get in to programming (was that the major they wanted to go for)? And if so what was their motivation to do so?

For weeks I was just looking at the book without any progress whatsoever, finally it clicked and when it did it was like 'oh, that's how it works'...

And in that regard:<p>svn < mercurial < git<p>svn: Three way merges are close to impossible. When you do a three way merge of a file you need to find the common ancestor of all three versions. This is just an incredibly difficult problem in svn that to my knowledge can't be solved in a way thats durable. In mercurial and git you can simply walk the graph to the common ancestor.<p>mercurial: Somewhat fails at the concept of a short lived local branch. You can't create a local branch in place--without cloning the entire repository to a different folder--to try out some feature and then delete the branch if it doesn't work out. At least not without using bookmarks or extensions: mq, localbranch. With these you get a bookmark, a patch queue, or an in-repository clone, respectively. None of these are branches in the fundamental sense.<p>git: You can get a short lived local branch, a long lived one, a release branch, a bug fix branch, a feature branch, branch, branch, branch. In git branching just works, and that, to me, if compared to mercurial, means specifically working local branches that are not fundamentally different to the rest of the repository.",1295109178

It was originally written by somebody else, then modified a bit for Apple's use. It tries to further compress png files and, I think, reorganizes them so that they can be more efficiently rendered by the iPhone's GPU. Like, maybe so they can be drawn bottom-to-top, rather than the usual top-to-bottom? I read about this once, but it was years ago, and I can't remember all the details.",1295108417

2107183,comment,2103465,2107005,0,0,stanleydrew,,,"Oh, I don't know, lets imagine a crazy world in which a bunch of things are 'invented' at the same time. Some company patents an invention. Then for a variety of reasons a different company gets huge, perhaps because it integrated a bunch of 'inventions' (some original, some invented in parallel) better than anyone else. That company then decides to pay a known price for the patents it doesn't own to avoid the unknown cost and unpleasantness of a lawsuit.<p>My point is mostly that software patents don't prove original invention. And moreover, buying patents indicates nothing. There are tons of reasons to want software patents, not least of which is a need to defend oneself against trolls. Many companies buy patents related to their core technologies not because they are afraid of getting sued for infringing on those particular patents, but because they want to present a credible threat of countersuit should anyone sue them.<p>Of course it could be both. I'm just saying that buying patents proves nothing.",1295108119

Some of the classes were really good, but in some cases the adjunct profs weren't very dedicated to teaching; then again, failure to maintain quality control on professional instruction is a problem at lots of reputable schools.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.online.uillinois.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.online.uillinois.edu/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.cvn.columbia.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cvn.columbia.edu/</a>",1295108007

Neither is using bookmarks an effective solution. Both solution make the decision to branch a much more deliberate process, and in the end you still don't get a branch that is equal to its peers.<p>As the result, in hg, you have to decide in advance ""what kind of branch"" it will be -- or you have to get in the habit of using mq's for everything -- and this just not a natural experience especially for a DVCS where branching is just fundamental.",1295107854

260662,comment,260470,260568,0,0,LogicHoleFlaw,,,"You can't copyright the rules to the game. Any distinctive design elements can be copyrighted. But if those elements are dictated by the rules then they still cannot be copyrighted.<p>Honestly I doubt that Hasbro could successfully pursue a copyright infringement case over Scrabulous. Scrabble has a very generic design which is mostly directly implemented from the rules. Hasbro's best bet would likely be a trademark claim. Though, if a court determined that ""Scrabble"" has become a generic term for an acrostic game then they could actually lose the trademark. That's a serious danger, just from my own personal perception.<p>The DMCA is a lousy way for Hasbro to try to eliminate Scrabulous. If I were Scrabulous I would send a counter-notice, at which point under the DMCA Facebook would be required to reinstate the game. Then take it to court. Hasbro will have a hell of a time making this one stick.<p>Edit:<p>The safe harbor and counter-notice provisions of the DMCA are the only thing I like about it.<p>Hasbro is the current Evil Empire of the toy industry. I would not mind seeing them taken down a peg. Long live the underdog!",1217347169

Would we want the Iranians to investigate unknown aerial objects in their skies with little radar return? Probably not, but it's the smart thing to do.<p>I love UFOs because they represent transient, non-reproducible aerial phenomenon. Yet during the times we make observations, it seems we're able to do so in a variety of spectra. It gets directly into the question of what reality is. Is it what credible witnesses perceive? Well, credible witnesses can mis-interpret phenomenon. But if we don't have credible witnesses, we've only got reproducible experiments, which obviously doesn't work with transient phenomenon. Does that mean we have nothing of value here? No -- that's crazy talk. When people see things, their observations have to mean _something_.<p>Some folks talk about finding materials.

260615,comment,259748,260541,0,0,helveticaman,,,"The genetic basis is there.  First, I suspect the Flynn effect is simply natural selection in modern society; after all, if environment changes in the Galapagos can change the shape of birds beaks in a few generations, industrialization should make people better at desk jobs.  And according to Gregory Clark, this has happened to Anglo-Saxons between the 1300s and the 1800s. [1]  The same appears to have happened to Ashkenazi Jews and East Asians.[2]  Keep in mind they, too, were once very disadvantaged in American society, but there's no keeping them down; both groups are richer than whites now, and had to contend with heavy discrimination on their way to riches.  In fact, because of the belief all races should be equally represented, Asian students are heavily penalized in college admissions to make room for African Americans and Hispanics. [3]  Finally, I wouldn't go so far as saying emigration eliminates gaps; emigrants aren't necessarily representative of a group, as they're the ones who are ambitious or desperate enough to want to leave.  Mexican immigrants in the United States do not form an accurate cross-section of Mexican culture.  Nigerian immigrants in United States have the highest rate of PhDs and Master degrees per capita [4], but that has a lot to do with immigration policies.  It's a lot easier to get into the States with a Masters or a PhD, so there's selection at hand.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/gclark/papers/clark_evolution.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/gclark/papers/clark_evol...</a>

If YC <i>is</i> an unhealthy environment–and I see no evidence that it is, but perhaps the kool-aid is in my brain–then it's a relatively small one.<p>I mean, most people here realize they don't need ycomb, right? It's one of many ways to get some initial funding, but it's certainly not the only way or even the normal way.

The registration was short, but making yet another account is still a big jump for some people (like me). You should let people enter cities and put pins in the map before they register so that they can play around with it and feel more comfortable. I think that would increase your conversion of visitors to sign ups.<p>You should find a way to add accounts via SMS or even the iphone GPS. That would make it way easier to track the various places I go than going back to the website. More moible integration seems like it's a good idea...these people travel a lot right?<p>I think your social system (the list of thumbnails when you click on ""viewed by __ other people"") looks pretty cool.

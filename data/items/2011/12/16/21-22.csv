It's quite likely that the ""last 10%"" will take much longer than you think.<p>That said, I've seen this happen quite often from inexperienced developers, and it sounds like you have one on your hands.  It's easy for passion and ego to carry a project from a blank slate to a state of mostly-functioning.  Hackers usually get a great rush from this stage of the project.  It's their code, their architecture, their baby.  Sure it's got some rough edges, but the important stuff is done.  Their genius has been imbued into it, now comes the drudgery of polishing the edges - oh wait, this sucks.  The process of turning something that works into something that's usable or salable is boring.  What a letdown.  They just solved this intractable problem in O(log n) time, and now you want them to make the interface's corners rounded or add some copy?  Bah.  They'd rather stare at the wall.<p>This is a total shot in the dark here, but I've seen it often enough that I'm fairly sure it's the mentality you're dealing with.  And I can't say there's an easy solution.  It's nearly impossible to motivate hackers who think creating software is all fun, all the time.  You either chose a bad cofounder, or just a young one who needs some exposure to real software development projects.  either way, I'd recommend a confrontation, followed up by hiring out if things don't change.",1324072664

This is despite tremendous efforts and motivation to run those languages quickly on such environments, see for example Microsoft's SPUR paper and everything it has done in the CLR to speed up dynamic languages.</i><p>I'd argue the opposite regarding tremendous efforts and motivation; dynamic languages were an after-thought for both the JVM and .NET, and on the JVM side you've only seen any attempts to improve performance recently, with invokedynamic for Java 7.<p>The investments here occurred long after the VMs were developed.<p>> <i>The reasons for this are technical: We do not know how to make a single VM that runs all languages quickly.</i><p>The same applies to compilers across the board; we do not know how to make a compiler that applies all possible optimization available to code always, either. I still have to manually vectorize critical paths, re-order code (sometimes in C!) to help the compiler avoid pipeline stalls, etc.<p>Instead, we do the best general purpose job we can, and it's usually more than fast enough.<p>What we're talking about here is a VM that has JS support as its first-order target. Using the JVM and CLR as performance examples here -- given what they were built for, and when -- is not particularly valid.<p>Speaking to NaN-boxing in particular; it's one solution to the problem, but not the only one. I'm going to remain unconvinced here, given that dynamic languages have almost always been a late, second-tier concern for anyone investing serious R&D in the development of a VM/JIT/compiler.<p>All that said ...<p>> <i>The fact is, despite all those efforts, even Microsoft did not implement JS on .NET in IE. This despite Microsoft more than anyone having the capability and moreso the motivation (""everything on .NET""). Microsoft gave up and implemented a new JS engine in native code, and it made that new native JS VM a peer of .NET in Windows 8.</i><p>Even given the above, implementing a custom optimized JavaScript VM -- even if it was only available in JS-only case -- would not be a failure scenario.",1324071821

Indeed IIRC we in the UK are possibly going to be allowed to rip CDs and DVDs legally in the next couple of years (!).<p>What I think is that purchasing the book gives one a right to read it. Producing an ebook of the text for personal consumption should be fine and so by extension, IMO, there is nothing immoral about downloading the text of a book when one has paid to read that text. Indeed format shifting in books should be an allowed use.<p>Of course the actual ebook is going to have ""company dress"" and typesetting and what-have-you that's going to be protected by copyright. So one will probably need a service where you send your paperback, it gets the binding cut, is scanned and an ebook is made of the text. Of course then you can optimise by the company offering the service buying the paperback from the publisher for you, so you just get an ebook delivered with a receipt saying you bought the book.<p>And then the idiocy of this is apparent because a book is being created digitally only to be  published and bound then scanned back to create a digital copy ... at this stage the publishers should assent to saving forests, ink, energy, water, etc., and allow the ebook to be sold at a reasonable price ...<p>[I've blogged to this effect before, <a href=""http://alicious.com/on-ebook-copies-a-quick-opinion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alicious.com/on-ebook-copies-a-quick-opinion/</a>]",1324071469

He has the cars - but has a hard time trying to find drivers.<p>He said that the drivers can make between 3 and 4 thousand per month. Which is great. I recommended a friend who has a degree in cartography but cant find a job. 4K/month is a great salary for anyone struggling in this economy.<p>The iphone app is fantastic. Call the car, see it on the map, get a txt when they arrive - or the driver calls if he needs better directions.<p>You don't get that with a private car.<p>Although - There is CERTAINLY a market for an open version of the Uber app.<p>Imagine the open-cab concept - works just like Uber - but drivers register their availability in the app and users make pickup requests just the same. The drivers select the client they are going to get - and the app manages the queues.<p>Totally doable.",1324070775

It's sounds like an unsupported assumption<p>No, he is entirely correct.<p>JavaScript and most dynamic languages do not run at full speed on static-language VMs like the JVM and .NET. This is despite tremendous efforts and motivation to run those languages quickly on such environments, see for example Microsoft's SPUR paper and everything it has done in the CLR to speed up dynamic languages.<p>The fact is, despite all those efforts, even Microsoft did not implement JS on .NET in IE. This despite Microsoft more than anyone having the capability and moreso the motivation (""everything on .NET""). Microsoft gave up and implemented a new JS engine in native code, and it made that new native JS VM a peer of .NET in Windows 8.<p>The reasons for this are technical: We do not know <i></i>how<i></i> to make a single VM that runs all languages quickly. It's very difficult to do! Dynamic languages need hand-crafted PICs for example, which are extremely difficult to make portable and safe, which is necessary for a VM on the web. Also, low-level details like even how to implement numbers are significant: NaNboxing for example is used in most JS engines, but it probably doesn't make sense in a static language VM. Having both NaNboxed numbers and 'normal' ones in one VM is cumbersome and complex.",1324070738

I may not use Erlang, but I learned a lot from it. Clojure introduced a ton of interesting concurrency constructs (among other advances). C# demonstrated LINQ, and F# is OCaml revisited.<p>In all of these cases it has nothing to do with whiny developers ""refusing to write in anything but their favorite language"".

How? If I can't manage to motivate him, should I pay someone else to finish the product? Should I just do nothing and wait? He said he will eventually finish it and to please not bother him, so I stopped asking so as not to annoy him.  I just said to let me know if he needs anything.  However, I am really concerned - that was a week ago and no updates at all from him on how the product is doing.<p>We have a second product we want to make after this one and he is still enthusiastic about that.

Some companies, those most likely to be be the victim of litigation by those in favor of the bill will have no choice but to implement the software due to the threat of litigation damages.<p>However, the best way to combat litigation damages would be a threat to those same companies from every network that connects to them. i.e. an internet embargo against any company that implements the filtering and changes to the DNS.<p>At the end of the day networks need to connect to other networks. If a company implements software that filters it, every network that doesn't have the same obligation can embargo those businesses so that those businesses have no choice but to fight the MPAA and RIAA.<p>Treat those that implement the technology like a cancer and ""excise"" them from the network.<p>Following the money is the only way to prevent the technological implementation of SOPA from spreading. There needs to be an equally or more costly financial threat from the anti-SOPA companies.<p>It doesn't even need to be at the network level. The browser level is sufficient. Chrome, Firefox and Internet explorer (built by 3 organizations that are against SOPA) could all embargo sites at the browser level in the default installations of the browsers. The majority of Internet dollars travel through the browser. The browsers could sniff for DNS systems implementing SOPA and blacklist them. If your DNS implements SOPA then you aren't part of the internet. If they want a browser that supports networks that implement SOPA, let them build it themselves and spend time and money trying to get their browser adopted.<p>The search engine level is another approach. Google, Bing and DuckDuckGo could reduce the search rank of every site on networks that implements SOPA.<p>SOPA uses legislation to break the technological contract that keeps the internet together.

He adamantly REFUSED to believe me. Told him how to reproduce it and his response was ""I don't need to do that because I know it works fine."" I pointed out that until the bug was fixed, I couldn't make progress because my code was dependent on theirs working, he suggested it was somehow my fault. 'K then. I found a way to reproduce the bug <i>without any of my code running</i> (they had written a simple external dialog to demo the module) and the guy still maintains that ""there are no bugs in that code, I've been running it here for weeks. You must not know what you're doing.""<p>If he wasn't 1,000 miles away I swear I would have gone over there and beaten him over the head with a stack of Knuth!<p>Finally I said screw it and went over his head. I knew his manager (who used to be a programmer) pretty well and explained the problem and how I was being stonewalled. He figured it out in less than a minute on the phone and told me how to setup their configuration file so it wouldn't trigger the bug and promised the bug would be fixed. And apologized as a bonus.<p>Not surprisingly, we had tons of problems later with them not properly testing a bunch of common error paths. Finally the TL pissed off the wrong person and got himself fired.<p>OK, this is a bit OT, but I needed that rant :-)",1293224279

I read the article in large part because of my medical condition, which typically leads to lung damage and also puts one at high risk for a form of diabetes (as I understand it, neither ""type 1"" nor ""type 2"" -- something unique to the condition I have).  I have done a lot to get healthier and I now live without a car and do a lot of walking as it is my main mode or transportation.  I have read that inflammation may be at the root of diabetes.  Inflammation is a major issue with my condition and there is much drug research which indicates you can reduce incidence of infection in people like me by controlling inflammation.  I chose to control inflammation by making dietary and lifestyle changes rather than pursuing drugs as a primary defense.<p>I think the reduced lung function (over time) that my condition leads to, and thus reduced oxygenation is also a major factor in infection, even though I haven't really seen anything which states that per se.  So I no longer believe that the primary benefit of exercise is ""burning calories"". I believe the primary benefit is oxygenation and other chemical changes it causes, which reduces infection and generally improves the body chemistry.  I also think I survived my health crisis in part from having lived 3000 feet above sea level at one time, thereby forcibly expanding my lung capacity (I used to have a really narrow rib cage for someone my height and I look more normal since living 3000 feet above sea level).<p>Anyway, no real point here.

2037972,comment,2037422,2037422,0,0,cheald,,,"I am a reformed non-tester. A couple of projects ago, I started writing some tests for some particularly gnarly pieces of code that I wasn't confident were going to stay working throughout the product's development cycle. Once I got those written, I found that I was over a hump - I was already set up with my test suite, object factories, net communications stubs, etc - all the hard work was done.<p>At that point, I found that it became <i>faster</i> to write my tests and then code to make them pass than it was to develop ""traditionally""; in cases where you do lot of setup or teardown for a piece of code (what happens when a user adds X to his account? Manually testing involves, adding, then testing, then clearing, then adding...), automated tested really shines. What used to take 30 seconds of manual testing time per iteration now takes a ctrl-S and 3 seconds of tests. Multiply that by 20 iterations and the time savings are significant.<p>I'm at the point now that I write tests <i>because</i> it saves me time, not because it's the ""right thing to do"", and I'm much more confident in my code as a result. I don't test everything, but the stuff that's easily testable, high volatility, or mission critical, you betcha, that's getting tested thoroughly.<p>The problem is that if you write, manually test, and commit a piece of code once, you're only guaranteed that it is working at the time that you commit. Two weeks down the road when you change something only mildly related, you either a) retest that ""known good"" code, or b) make the potentially faulty assumption that it still works. Once an app reaches a certain level of complexity, any particular change is going to require a QA department to ensure that it didn't break something else. Automated tests are your first-line QA department. Your test suite can exercise all the important bits of your code in one fell swoop, so if you break anything, it'll let you know, and quickly. The value of this cannot be understated, and once you've tasted it, you'll never want to go back.",1293223446

Indeed, they may be the longest-lived complex animals of any sort.""<p>I wish I had the money to follow up on that. Of the long-lived vertebrate species (I mean the ones that can live in excess of 200 years) most seem to be at least occasionally exposed to high pressures in the deep sea (off hand, the only exception I can think of is land-based turtles, who also live a long time yet, as far as I know, never face deep sea pressures).<p>At this point there is a substantial literature suggesting health benefits, to humans, from hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Certainly, HBO seems to be an effective treatment for insulin resistance. This raises the question, is it the pressure, or the oxygen, or both, that creates the health benefit?<p>I can imagine arguments in both directions. Possibly the pure oxygen creates oxidative stress which then brings forth a response, as Wikipedia writes here (on a page about calorie restriction):<p>""Although aging can be conceptualized as the accumulation of damage, the more recent determination that free radicals participate in intracellular signaling has made the categorical equation of their effects with ""damage"" more problematic than was commonly appreciated in years past. It was previously proposed on a hypothetical basis that free radicals may induce an endogenous response culminating in more effective adaptations which protect against exogenous radicals (and possibly other toxic compounds).[49] Recent experimental evidence strongly suggests that this is indeed the case, and that such induction of endogenous free radical production extends life span of a model organism and mitohormetically exerts life extending and health promoting effects. Sublethal mitochondrial stress with an attendant stoichiometric augmentation of reactive oxygen species may precipitate many of the beneficial alterations in cellular physiology produced by caloric restriction.""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie_restriction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie_restriction</a><p>But pressure can lead to the increase of a wide range of chemical reactions, and probably increases the activity of various enzymes.

Montreal has been riven by cultural heterogenity (between English, French, and others) ever since the 1700s, and yet has an even lower crime rate.</i><p>That's a fair point. Canada probably does a better job than the US of handling those issues. French Canadian culture is an interesting difference we don't really have in America--French Canadians (unless I'm mistaken) are no more or less affluent than English Canadians and, aside from various controversies over Quebec separatism, by and large don't seem to be materially oppressed. Those aren't things you can say about, for instance, America's Spanish-speaking population.<p>American culture accepted and integrated generations of European immigrants, but those immigrants largely assimilated (or rather, their children did) due to geographic isolation from the countries they immigrated from. That geographic isolation doesn't exist for Latin American immigrants, and it's quite possible they will remain a different culture in perpetuity. America is going to have to learn how to accept that diversity rather than expecting assimilation. As you may have gathered, we're not doing a great job of that so far.",1293223024

2037954,comment,2036586,2037024,0,0,unoti,,,"For those of you looking at this video to get an idea of the power of vim in the hands of a serious user:  although this person is using it quickly, he is nowhere near a master.  The key to vi is that any time a user is pressing the same key multiple times, there is a faster way.  In this video I often see the user using the same keystroke multiple times to get from here to there.  Most notable, he routinely does this to get from his cursor position over to  a spot later in the line (such as when changing the word ""test"" which was in quotes), or to get to the end of a section (such as when he was copying then changing the body of a function).<p>If you're a vi user or an aspiring vi user that wants to get faster, then start consciously looking for times that you're pressing the same key more than about twice.  Each of those times is almost certainly an opportunity to get faster.<p>So in particular from watching the above video, these are two shortcuts that I use all the time that the video maker did not use.  Let's say you have a line of text like: Img.save('roberto.png') and you want to change it to x.png.  If your cursor is at the start of the line, you would never arrow over there.  You would type fr (find r, which would move your cursor to the r in Roberto).  Then you would type ""ct.x"" which means change until we get to the period and replace it with the letter x.  It sounds complex, but after a while you just do it without thinking, and it's faster to type 5 keystrokes with 2 hands than a bunch of repeated keystrokes with one hand.<p>Similarly, the } and { keys should be used to navigate to the next or previous blank line, which could have been used in this video to change the body of those functions in a couple of keystrokes instead of the arrowing around and highlighting we were seeing.<p>I'm not trying to pick apart the video, the person is clearly fast and effective.  The point is just that vi gives you the flexibility to always get faster if that's what you're into.",1293222775

I get the sense that in Blum's corner of CS, and probably also systems, it's the other way around: you get some results, and then you write them up (though what counts as getting results, and how to go about it, differs quite a bit, as you point out). Whereas in the areas I work in, in some sense the thesis <i>is</i> sometimes the result. Sure, there are a bunch of technical results in it too, but they're a supporting cast of characters, included because they bolster the main analysis/argument/proposal.<p>I suppose the model I'm thinking of is somewhat more humanities-style thesis organization, which makes some sense, since AI has always been a bit coy about whether it's a subfield of CS, of cog sci, of philosophy, of engineering, or of something else.

List is an ADT in Java and OCaml and some of the literature, an implementation in Python, C++ etc. Linked-list would have avoided that, although possibly suggests an answer.<p>Having said that, I&#x27;d be minded to look dimly on a candidate who tried to sidestep that question with &#x27;but I use Python and they&#x27;re the same there, so it&#x27;s just a question of semantics&#x27; and did not try to clarify the question with me.",1439618349

10064482,comment,10059896,10064388,0,0,JoshTriplett,,,"> One particular (very large, very important) dependency currently requires CentOS 6.5.<p>What dependency is that?  And can you run it in a single-purpose virtual machine, rather than directly on real hardware, to make it easier to manage?<p>> As much as possible, I want to treat infrastructure as a commodity, so catering to specific versions (even LTR versions) breaks that goal. As another reply notes, if we lock in at Ubuntu 12.04 and it&#x27;s predictable, that&#x27;s excellent.<p>You definitely don&#x27;t want to cater to specific versions any more than you have to; ideally you want as few versions across your entire fleet as you can.  If you could get it down to just CentOS and the latest version of some up-to-date distribution, that would help; if you could make CentOS a virtual machine under that same up-to-date distribution, that&#x27;s even better, insofar as you can then manage all the physical machines identically.<p>> As another mentions, Upstart was easy to get a handle of quickly. As an aside, it bugs me that the (otherwise excellent and detailed) Upstart docs don&#x27;t seem to mention that all of Upstart is now deprecated. Hence the original confusion!<p>The Upstart docs aren&#x27;t going to say that Upstart is deprecated.  It&#x27;s more a view of the Linux distribution ecosystem as a whole: the one distribution that primarily drove upstart usage and adoption is switching to systemd, so there won&#x27;t be further momentum or resources behind upstart in the future.  That doesn&#x27;t make it instantly obsolete, but it does mean that starting a new project today around upstart is a bad idea.<p>(In fairness, there&#x27;s one other notable distribution using upstart as well, namely Chrome OS; however, that&#x27;s a bit of a special case in several ways, and in any case I hope to change that in the future.)",1439618300

They&#x27;re capable of inventing novel tricks, and then communicating the behavior with a different dolphin, proven by them doing the same new trick in synchrony without either having seen it before.  They are also capable of communicating abstract concepts to dolphins in a separate partition of the tank who they can &quot;hear&quot; but not see.  We don&#x27;t know if their language has an equivalent of &quot;sentences&quot;, I guess, so you may be technically correct, but I find it hard to imagine a method in which the complex and abstract concepts Dolphins have been shown to communicate only have a single or small finite number of representations.<p>Captive Dolphins can also understand syntax in human sentences.  They understand the difference between &quot;get the hoop and then the ball&quot;, and &quot;get the ball and then the hoop&quot;.  And they can generalize this to different concepts and numbers of clauses, and tend to act confused if the sentence is egregiously ungrammatical.  They also understand future and past tense, and the difference between a statement and a question.  Is it likely that they would understand our language so well if they didn&#x27;t have something fairly similar of their own, if they hadn&#x27;t developed language capabilities at a young age?  They seemingly have a better ability to understand human language than feral children.<p>Finally, there is evidence that the Shannon entropy of dolphin language is at least 3-4.  Human languages are around 8-9, but not enough data has been collected to know that the Dolphin language isn&#x27;t more complex, and captive Dolphins may have less sophisticated communication than wild ones.  In any case, I think even if their language is effectively determined by only 3-4 letter sequences (their &quot;alphabet&quot; is about the same size as English - ~27 whistles) rather than 8-9, that&#x27;s still complex enough for me to doubt your claim that language capabilities are unique to humans.",1439616499

They ended up spending about half as much time in prison.  And were 72% less likely to use drugs.

I grew up in a decent, moderately sized city (300k) going to a private religious school with children whose parents were similarly strongly interested in the intellectual development of their children.<p>I had access to all the sports teams. I played soccer through Varsity, played with the golf team [but note I was not <i>on</i> the golf team, hehe], and basketball in middle school. I played piano for 8 years. I attended one of the top 5 schools of my field in the nation, and graduated into a small company with other graduates from my school, MIT, etc. From &#x27;good places&#x27;.<p>Because of this, education was always something I always took for granted. I always valued it, but always took it for granted. My education, however, took humans for granted. Your value to society was sometimes considered limited by what you could produce. Additionally, many of those I highschooled and undergraduated with held little reservation filtering people out of their life based on, I&#x27;ll call it, &#x27;being dumb&#x27;.<p>This always bothered me. I believed in the intrinsic value of the human, so I always sought to correct for it. Because I always tried my hardest, it never occurred to me how people could willfully and knowingly not aspire themselves to something greater than what required minimal effort. Everyone I grew up with did, I did, and my parents did, so naturally I assumed everyone else did, too. As such, I was regularly perplexed at the value judgements certain colleagues would place on other members of humanity.<p>So I left that company, and struck out on my own.
I have since discovered what a rare breed my background nurtured, and now understand the wisdom in filtering those you spend time with. Instead of a prideful superiority [which I certainly observed], I exercise with a cautious respect for, and in protection of, talent and time. I exercise without placing value judgements <i>on</i> the people I come in contact with, but I <i>do</i> judge the values <i>of</i> the people I spend time with. In this way I safely continue to respect their humanity, and avoid pride.<p>It&#x27;s only since I moved and became aware of my need to protect that I became aware of how hard it is to find knowledge seekers. And so, when I come across someone from a different field but similar excellence, who carries with them persuasive content helpful for advancement, I am thankful.<p>And so I am thankful to have found HackerNews, and specifically this lecture material that I can&#x27;t wait to watch.<p>It&#x27;s very important to surround yourself with excellence.

We are now considering a pivot to scale it. At the core of this pivot, we realized that people are already negotiating before they buy today. If we can incentivize them to share this knowledge (at what price and from where they are buying), probabilistically we will get the best price in our system in long run.<p>Here is how we are planning to execute it: we are now introducing an app which will be top up with virtual currency (say 3 coins). User can still ask for best price for any product (it will cost them - say 1 coin). Once they run out of coins, we will ask them to upload a receipt of any recent purchase they made - say iPhone 6. We will extract the price and seller information from the receipts. Later on, if other user is looking for best price for iPhone 6, we can surface all the information from the crowd who has submitted receipts for iPhone 6, ofcourse anonymously.

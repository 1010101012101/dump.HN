And a dedicated console has different RAM requirements than a generic OS box.  Also games have forever been making due with what RAM is available.<p>The DVD/blueray player IMHO misses the point. It's an internet download game console. It's now an all-in-one media box, it's one (cheap!) thing.  Get a separate blueray/dvd player if you need (cheap too)<p>Ok I too wonder a bit about the storage but that mostly irrelevant <i>if</i> they have an SD card slot<p>Powerful enough video card? Well, it's playing android games and the tegra is the best android video card out there right now.  I'm not sure you can just drop an off the shelf nvidia/ati card into and android/ARM setup and have it go with out some expensive driver development somewhere. The tegra already works, is ready to go, and gives the current best performance of the market and games they are targeting.<p>Controller: I'm pretty sure at over half a year out they can tweak that. And usually as with every other console there's a decent market in 3rd party controllers.<p>I think the $100 price point is one of it's best features and doubling it would be terrible.",1341964675

4226939,comment,4225811,4225811,37,0,tokenadult,,,"I took care to read the fine submitted article (based on a press release) and most of the preceding twenty-some comments before replying here. Comments to the effect that we often see stories like this based on press releases that don't translate into clinically useful treatments are correct. Anyone who has been on Hacker News as long as I have has seen dozens upon dozens of stories about breakthrough medical treatments that don't turn out to be breakthroughs.<p>As usual, here in this thread I recommend Peter Norvig's article ""Warning Signs in Experimental Design and Interpretation"" about how to read research reports in general.<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>Medical research is slow and painstaking. There has been genuine progress in medical research in my lifetime. (My mother was a nurse in our state's largest research hospital, and medical research was a subject of dinner table conversation in my home.) But false starts have been numerous. There are a great many medical treatments that have been proposed in my lifetime that have not been proven to be both safe and effective for treating what they purport to treat. Peter Norvig's article provides a good checklist of all the ways that optimistic initial reports can turn out to be wrong, of which ""too few subjects"" especially applies here.<p>I reply over and over and over again on threads like this here on Hacker News because I did grow up with a strong interest in medical research--and some anecdotes about medical research that went awry--and because I know that legitimate medical researchers sometimes find their work hyped by the university press office or funding agencies far beyond their own more cautious statements. But here on Hacker News we may as well learn how to be discerning readers. Let's not just believe what we want to believe, which is the cognitive bias all human beings have, but let's test factual statements for strong evidence and make sure that the experimental procedures reported in some new study mentioned in a press release really support a grand conclusion. It's too early here to say ""Drug made from toxic weed kills cancer"" in a way that is safe and effective for a broad range of human patients for even the one kind of cancer that is mentioned in the article submitted here. I'm glad someone is working on this, but it's way too early to declare that we've found a cancer cure through this work.",1341964512

Either would be safer than what we have now, proliferation-resistant, and produce a lot less nuclear waste with a much shorter lifetime. We could have a very energy-rich future without carbon emissions.<p>As for carbon credits, a lot of economists advocate a ""fee-and-dividend"" scheme. Instead of trading credits, major source emitters simply pay a flat fee per ton of carbon, passing on the cost to the rest of us. The money is divided among all citizens, equal amount per person. Most people come out ahead (since the median emissions are less than the average), but since the dividend is constant and the new cost variable, everyone has more incentive to conserve.<p>I've seen calculations for the contribution of waste heat and it's very minor compared to greenhouse gases. However, if our energy usage continues to grow exponentially on this planet it'll be a real problem in a couple hundred years:

Additionally, shrinking a tumour is a long way from a cure.<p>For example - The drug Ipilimumab (melanoma) was shown in clinical trials to increase median survival from 6.4 months to 10 months. Some people may have disease-free recurrence for significantly longer than they would have, some may actually be 'cured' (Disease-free survival for 5 years is a fairly standard medical definition of 'cure'), others die at the same time, or a week, or a month, later than they would have anyway.<p>For all of these drugs, there is no magic bullet, the tumour will evolve around the mechanism..

These are the same voters who voted for Gray and his crony, corrupt administration in the last mayoral election. They know very well that Rhee's ""No Child Left Behind""-style reforms were just going to screw up the school system worse for their kids.<p>And they sure as hell didn't want to re-elect Fenty, who never showed that he was willing to work on the tough problems that cause DC's entrenched poverty.

We know all of this, we are beginning to elucidate the chromosomal translocations and karyotypes that seem to appear in certain families of cancers (and a specific cancer type will have the same 'assortment' of chromosomal typings)
all that remains is to continue to design increasingly effective anti-cancer agents, one part of which this article is explaining.<p>I don't believe there will be a single magic bullet, however treatments that have an immunological basis (See this NEJM paper that offers incredible hope for CLL - <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1103849"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1103849</a> )

That's why we won.<p>That is very close to the ""fine tuning"" argument often employed by creationists. It is entirely possible that humans have, in fact, merely been phenomenally lucky to have survived so far, and that the fact that we find ourselves as members of such a phenomenally lucky species is easily explained by the anthropic principle.<p>If you take all of the intelligent critters out there in the universe that are capable of discussing their adaptability, a pretty big chunk of those critters are going to be members of civilizations that got very lucky over the ages and managed to produce large cumulative populations, while a very small proportion will be critters from short-lived civilizations. Indeed, holding constant whatever level of adaptability we actually have, it is reasonable to assume that we are among the luckier of the civilizations at that level.<p>So no, we can't just assume that we're going to leap over any hurdle that comes our way.",1341961734

Everything from ""it's too underpowered"" to straight up ""Gaming on android is a sad, laggy affair"" and calling them ""amateurs"".<p>I think there's a significant proportion of the HN userbase that responds to things like Kickstarter funding with indignation, because it neatly circumvents the VC funding process that so many of us have suffered through.

4226739,comment,4223627,4224014,13,0,KVFinn,,,">I would honestly be shocked if they can ship a console with even those specs along with a controller and all the assorted bits and pieces you need, to an end user for $99 without eating some hidden costs themselves<p>Google is selling the Nexus 7 right now for 200 dollars.  This is essentially the same hardware but:<p>1) No screen, no batteries, no cellular radio<p>2) No need to squeeze it into the tiniest and lightest possible form factor<p>3) It doesn't come out until next year.<p>While I have no idea if they are actually competent, it is a reasonable goal.  The controller apparently costs 30 dollars.<p>>Even worse, the hardware specs are just... short-sighted. 8GB of storage is not remotely enough for a console that has no physical storage medium for games<p>It's going to have an SSD slot.  They omitted that in their description but that info is available in the other news articles.  Not ideal but a perfectly okay spot to save on IMO.<p>>There's also other assorted details that just make this feel lazy... Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo all made sure that each of their buttons has a distinct shape or letter associated with it so that in-game text and UI can communicate clearly to anyone who plays.<p>Agreed.  I hope they fix this before launch.<p>>I could also rant about the fact that they think a Tegra 3 and Cortex A9 is adequate for a game console, but honestly I'm not worried about that.<p>It's a good baseline.  They can't go higher than this and sell it for 100 dollars.<p>The one hardware bit I am worried about is that they make no mention of accelerometer and gyroscope in the controller.  The Nexus 7 and pretty much any recent cellphone and tablet being have them now.  They make great low cost all in one chips for this they really need to squeeze that in there or they will be locked out of a huge amount of possible games.<p>In general, we've all seen a huge surge of awesome games and innovation on tablets and phones in recent years.  I don't think it is due to just the form factor -- it is because anyone in their garage can publish a game for the platform.  Bringing this ease of development into the formerly protected space of the console/tv gaming is the benefit of this console.",1341961556
4226738,comment,4224873,4226601,2,0,Variance,,,"Agreed on the poor choices of examples, though that Wikipedia article is terrible. There's absolutely nothing contrary to classical economics in ""cost disease"", and Baumol's stuff was more an analysis of the economics of a situation than a sudden discovery of some unforeseen phenomenon.<p>Articles like the OP link are little more than populist sensationalism. Valid and extremely strong arguments can be made for reform in the banking system, but they aren't made by expressing that banks should be ""in service of the people, not the profit."" Those are political talking points, and the most offensive is that he compared financial markets to casinos, which is where authors lose all credibility to anyone who understands economics.<p>Also:<p>>Price discovery is not a sexy function of markets<p>Hell yeah price discovery is sexy.

You just insulted over 100 years of psycological, biological study, observation, & evidence.</i><p>Not really, because there is no observation of or evidence for humans having instincts. :D<p><i>Not to mention you're completely ignoring the fact that we are wired for sex from birth and all the evidence and research that has gone into that. </i><p>That is <i>precisely</i> my point. Think about it. We <i>do not</i> have an instinct to have sex. We <i>choose</i> who to have sex with, and when. And our sexual desires are mediated by our preferences (which, in healthy well-functioning people, are chosen, although some people may not rise to that task). Sex is not an ""automatic"" behavior. Contrast this with the sexual behavior of, for example, sharks. There is a humongous difference there.<p>Now, in certain Muslim societies, it is considered a woman's fault if she is raped when she exposed some skin, because they believe that men <i>do not</i> have a choice about sex and cannot control themselves. That is abhorrent and wrong. But when you insist on humans having instincts, you are taking <i>that</i> side of this intellectual argument.<p><i>The first instinct a human has is to start sucking as soon as something touches its mouth.</i><p>It may be that pre-conceptual humans--that is, babies--have instincts. Since a lot of people use ""instinct"" sloppily, I'd have to think about it before I came down on either side. But when we talk about ""humans,"" we really mean (at least primarily) ""adult humans."" So I would not say that babies having an instinct to suckle negates my point in the least.<p>I suspect it is more an ""automatized reaction."" Calling it an instinct just doesn't seem right to me.<p><i>but I worry about your education.</i><p>Haha :D. Well, I would say I've demonstrated a lot of rational, independent thinking here. So, for that reson, I am not worried about my education. (As a sidenote, I am very highly educated in the formal sense... but that is not as important as being able to think an a rational, independent way.)",1341961260

What&#x27;s happening, broadly, is that in some places (esp. Asia), OS/phone vendors are losing in the early stages of a war between platform (iOS, Android) and meta-platform (things like WeChat, LINE, FB).<p>Yes, its central function is nominally an SMS replacement, but as a meta-platform it plasters over a bunch of gaps in the OS level. The central UI is a common, semi-hierarchical stream for notifications/news/messages with a consistent set of controls for deprioritizing/blocking things. Then you have services like payment, authentication, and social graph. A lightweight Instapaper/Evernote shared by all my apps. Handling for things like QR codes which western-designed OSes don&#x27;t do on a system level. Universal search for chat and non-chat content alike. A health/activity data feature for the various Bluetooth gizmos my friends and I use. Then, on top of that, you have tons of light-weight third-party services/apps which, while the experience can shoddier than a native app, for 50% of apps is far more convenient than actually downloading and updating so many 100MB+ apps on my phone and spotting their various red badges in a sea of icons/groups.<p>In effect, it&#x27;s a nascent vision of an OS oriented around a thread-based UI paradigm instead of an app-based UI paradigm.

So really all a lower TFSA means is that more RRSP needs to be used to get the same sheltered space.<p>The TFSA certainly has advantages: flexibility being the biggest one.  No bookkeeping, put money in whenever, and take it out with minimal restriction (aside from waiting until Jan. 1 to re-contribute).  That said, as long as you invest the tax refund you get from contributing to the RRSP (or even better, file a T1213 so you don&#x27;t pay those taxes in the first place), the RRSP is arguably a better retirement savings vehicle for most people (ie anyone who expects to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement than while they are contributing).  Also, the lack of flexibility makes it more likely that the money will still be there in retirement.<p>The TFSA is great, and selfishly I&#x27;d love to keep the extra space.

For text based approach such as Vim, it is great in fast input, text manipulations, complex searches, integrate with other tools, portability, etc.<p>But on the other hand in Xmind(or other mindmap applications), being able to see the nodes spreading out on the screen(with colors, icons and whatnot) , drag them around freely into various structures(trees, flow charts, fishbone diagrams, etc.) is really helpful to thinking and manipulation. Also you can attach a host of files(images, videos and stuff like that) to those nodes. I am torn between these two types of approaches, each with their respective advantages.",1448611762

Think iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma crossed with PageRank, which effectively wards against many types of collusion including simple sybil attacks.  Most of it hasn&#x27;t been validated in the real world on any scale, but I believe it is possible to do quite a bit better than we have seen - the only web-of-trust stuff I&#x27;ve seen in practice is ancient compared to the state of research.<p>One outstanding problem that comes to mind is certificate revocation when you have lost control of the private keys.  I think a multi-sig solution could probably mitigate this to a fair extent, so you still have some level of pseudo-trust between entities and a way to effectively call someone up and say, &quot;hey, I screwed up and need to kill this thing&quot;.",1427979558

You commit the most elementary fallacy out there, and worse, it is central to your whole argument. Worse still, you continually harp on &quot;basic errors&quot; and the difference between good and bad economists, while being a quintessential example of a bad economist who makes basic errors.<p>The most egregious, obvious, and deep-cutting error is that you equate money with wealth, which is made obvious when you contrast &quot;investing in the economy&quot; with &quot;just sitting on the money&quot; <i>as if these were two different things</i>. Money is not goods and services; money is a claim on goods and services. Therefore, hoarding or &quot;just sitting on&quot; money is not hoarding goods and services, but closer to the opposite. It is deliberately <i>not</i> commanding the goods and services one&#x27;s money could command, freeing up those goods and services to be used by others. Hoarding money is a kind of anti-hoarding of resources; it&#x27;s exactly equivalent to investing in an index fund over the entire economy.<p>For his reason, your whole argument is confused.

The one in the GPLv3 is typical: if you sue someone who uses gcc (whether it&#x27;s the FSF or a third-party user), alleging that they are infringing some of your patents through their use of gcc, then your license to gcc auto-terminates. The justification is something like: if you inhibit others&#x27; free use of this software through litigation, then you can&#x27;t use it freely either (at least, until the situation is resolved).<p>The Facebook retaliation clause differs in two respects:<p>1. It protects only Facebook, but extends that protection to disputes unrelated to the software. Your React license is terminated if you ever end up in patent litigation with Facebook or a subsidiary, regardless of whether it involves React or not. But it is <i>not</i> terminated if you initiate patent litigation against third-party React users, unlike the GPLv3 termination. So it&#x27;s not strictly a stronger or weaker retaliation clause in this respect, but I think a &quot;worse&quot; one.<p>2. Your React license is terminated if you challenge the validity of any Facebook patent, even if no lawsuit is involved (e.g. filing an USPTO challenge), and regardless of whether it involves React. As I read it, this covers even defensive patent challenges, e.g. if Facebook sues <i>you</i> over a patent, and you respond by challenging the patent&#x27;s validity, then your React license is terminated.

By 2020 I don&#x27;t expect any new platform to arise that both lacks a standards-compliant web browser and manages to <i>enforce</i> the lack of such a web browser. I also don&#x27;t expect any existing platform&#x27;s browsers to regress from the degree of standards compliance that they have at this moment. There do exist several scenarios whereby web standards could stagnate over this time period:<p>Scenario 1: A major platform allows only a single browser, that browser being produced by the platform&#x27;s parent company, and drags its feet in order to impede the standards process and promote native app development over web app development. The obvious potential candidate here is iOS, with Safari being the last major browser that has yet to commit to an &quot;evergreen&quot; model whereby features are quickly and regularly released. However, if ARC were to ever pose a threat to Apple&#x27;s app model such that they could not somehow counter it with crippling technical constraints, it would be in their best interest to rapidly advance Safari to feature parity with other browsers. In other words, if Apple were ever faced with the decision of empowering the web vs. tacitly empowering a platform backed solely by Google, they&#x27;re always going to choose the web.<p>Scenario 2: Chrome becomes dominant to the same degree that IE6 was once dominant. At this point anything that Google decides to implement (or to not implement) would de facto determine web standards, and just like Microsoft of old they could choose to leverage this power in order to advance a proprietary platform under their exclusive control. This is largely kept in check by Chrome&#x27;s inability to exist on iOS as anything other than a thin wrapper over Safari, a situation that is unlikely to ever change (at least, I don&#x27;t see any business motive to Apple making such a thing possible).<p>Scenario 3: Mozilla somehow loses its seat at the standards table. In the short term it may seem like Firefox can be ignored to a degree, but in the long term Mozilla is the Bismarck that keeps web standards moving forward in ways that are seen as beneficial to a majority of the vendors at the table. As long as there exist platforms with sizable userbases on which Firefox <i>can</i> be installed, it is in Mozilla&#x27;s interest to advance the web as quickly as possible while convincing two of the big three to play along in order to undermine the remaining mutual competitor (and hence indirectly gaining an influence over that competitor&#x27;s closed platform, using the browser as an attack vector). Mozilla&#x27;s recent contract with Yahoo will sustain their efforts at their current levels for at least another five years, but its fate beyond that time will depend on how well FirefoxOS does at keeping Firefox from being locked out of the increasingly closed platforms of the future.<p>Given all of the above, I think it&#x27;s safe to say that the web will continue to evolve rapidly for at least another five years, and the inexorable advance of mobile hardware will continue to close the gap between native performance and web performance (with projects like Mozilla&#x27;s Servo designed to accelerate the closing of this gap). In the meantime, the biggest hurdles are the process of web app development (sorely lacking compared to native development, though there appear to be tentative steps in the right direction) and the unanswered question of how to make payment on the web as frictionless as it is on mobile (seriously, someone start working on this).",1427977687

They certainly didn&#x27;t spend their budget on inventing a better tasting yogurt or one with different cultures in it, that&#x27;s for sure.<p>&quot;Sound quality&quot; is not a great reason to pick on Beats. Most headphones and speakers (under $1000 or so) aren&#x27;t even trying to sound neutral; they&#x27;re intentionally boosting certain frequencies and suppressing others. Beats headphones are obviously <i>massively</i> boosting the bass, but this isn&#x27;t any less &quot;accurate&quot; than, say, your average Grado headphones and many enthusiasts (myself included) really enjoy those things.<p>Marco Arment had the perfect analogy, I think.<p><pre><code>  &quot;Beats did to headphones what Starbucks did to coffee:

  headphones and wearing them in public.&quot;

While the changes brought by Beats and Starbucks haven&#x27;t been entirely positive, even if you don&#x27;t like them, they&#x27;ve definitely expanded the market.

They were hooked to a Yamaha RX-V373 audio receiver which in turn was optically connected to a PC so it couldn&#x27;t have been a question about the configuration. Anyway, the sound was completely flat, almost no bass - certainly no punch whatsoever, the highs were absurdly cut and the middles painfully mediocre to say the least. The entire range was so bad that I was really frustrated I couldn&#x27;t return them due to a hideous store policy at that time in RO. Not to mention that when you would pass the 75% volume mark the sound was completely distorted. What a complete disgrace. :(<p>The big takeaway: always test the product before you buy it never fall for the hype.",1427976046

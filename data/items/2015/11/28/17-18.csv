The small ones, in particular, are often extremely in need of help and the benefit gained can be enormous.<p>The biggest thing to consider up front is -- of course -- maintenance. It&#x27;s not that helpful to come in and bang out some code and then disappear. Find a topic area that you really care about, and then find one small non-profit that you think is doing great work in that area. Then, if you possibly can, build a long-term relationship with them. It doesn&#x27;t have to be a big time commitment. But it probably does need to be an ongoing commitment. At least for a reasonable length of time.",1448733581

This has killed far more people than coal mining. But most people don&#x27;t know that, as your comment illustrates. So part of the problem is that the risks of other power sources are not accurately represented.<p>(Also, btw, there is radioactivity in coal ash--more than in some types of nuclear waste.)",1448733508

We pay Mythic Beasts for a basic hosting service and they kindly provide us with a full support service in running the server and keeping the site and other services on the machine alive. That one machine runs various Raspberry Pi sub-sites, the Raspbian and NOOBS downloads server, the Raspbian apt mirror, MPEG licence key generation and more.<p>1. Why PHP?<p>We all know PHP sucks (we advocate Python in education), but WordPress is ideal for authors and contributors and that&#x27;s what we had to begin with.<p>2. Why WordPress?<p>When I joined the Foundation in 2013 they had a WordPress site Eben set up in 2011 and I wanted to keep the great user experience WordPress provides to authors and contributors so I built a bespoke theme expanding the content beyond the simple blog, keeping all former URLs working despite changes to the URL structure. Some of the newer content, like documentation and learning resources, is outside of WordPress and is pulled in from github and rendered into templates.<p>3. But why not build your own bespoke framework?<p>Firstly, if I did that, you&#x27;d tell me perfectly good web frameworks already exist. Secondly, WordPress is very mature and it&#x27;s easy to add functionality quickly. I&#x27;m not talking about BS plugins - I hardly use any. I mean it&#x27;s easy to add stuff into the templates, stuff you&#x27;re likely to want to do. Finally, I&#x27;d rather spend my time and the Foundation&#x27;s money doing educational projects.<p>4. WordPress caching plugins exist. Why don&#x27;t you just use them?<p>We use WP Super Cache. It does most of what we want, but has some pretty fatal flaws: it doesn&#x27;t go to cache for &quot;logged in users&quot; (including anyone who&#x27;s ever made a comment), it recreates the cache after every comment, it does some work to figure out of it can give the user a cached page or not (this slows it down a lot), it doesn&#x27;t cache the 404 page (more important than you&#x27;d think) and it doesn&#x27;t cache requests with any GET methods params. Mythic created their own static page generating script for the pages with the most hits which updates every minute, and that&#x27;s what kept us alive this time.<p>5. Why not use NGINX?<p>See a full article on this here: <a href=""http://blog.mythic-beasts.com/2014/11/14/hiphop-and-wordpress-if-youre-tired-of-tea-then-youre-tired-of-life/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.mythic-beasts.com/2014/11/14/hiphop-and-wordpres...</a><p>6.

And the military experience is not, in fact, &quot;really alien and uncomfortable&quot; to the &#x27;intellectual&#x27; (whatever that genre may be defined as...), but the military culture can be &#x27;uncomfortable&#x27; to the general society that the military is serving. The USMC has an extensive book-reading and continuing education requirments for both enlisted and officer. The MOS schoolhouse, wether combat arms or technical, is not a narrow, delimited curricula, and does not discuss only tactical considerations, but requires strategic thinking and emphasizes an ethical philospy not seen in anything outside of seminary school. While the previous 14 years have seen some very bad behavior by the military in SW Asia and Africa, the daily performance of the marine rifleman on combat patrol has been the best of any generation of marines that preceeded them, including WWII.<p>The downside to a tour in the military is that of distrust and isolationism. Your most trusted life-long friends will probably be those that were developed during a short four-year stint. You will have difficulty relating to those that did not share this experience.<p>Finally, few people are suited emotionally, intellectually, or physically for some military branches;and those branches having a less onerous lifestyle seem to have increased entrance requirments.

If you put critical thinking as an item on your resume, only a very small crowd would view it as information rather than noise.<p>I guess the other wrinkle is explaining to people that &quot;critical thinking&quot; encompasses a lot more than destroying opposing arguments and building secure arguments of your own; critical thinking is a necessary but not sufficient skill to engage in formal debate, but that&#x27;s not what most people use it for anyway. Critical thinking is a modality for interacting with the world, and its dictum is active engagement of ideas rather than passive reception and acceptance. Actively engaging with the world involves abstractly de-greasing the gears of their mental machinery so that they seize up and require hands-on attention more often. Rather than allowing an advertisement to blare its claims unchallenged as is default, critical thinking will consider the motives of the advertisers, their most effective methods, the target audience, the angles of human nature it is attempting to leverage, and the  explicit or insinuated claims of the advertisement. The author notes broadly that being a sucker is both the cause and result of passively accepting outside claims/advertisements and physically acting based on the assumption that those claims are true. We can not say, however, that learning critical thinking will undo suckerdom (this was discussed in depth in The Republic), but it may innoculate people against falling for some future timeshare sale.<p>I have long thought about assembling course materials to teach critical thinking, and dreamt about creating an institute for the teaching of critical thinking. Once again, the trouble is convincing people that critical thinking is essential, even though to some of us it may seem obvious. The problem with getting people to take critical thinking seriously is that critical thinking looks a lot like what you&#x27;d learn in a philosophy or English class, which people identify with being useless because they don&#x27;t translate into jobs as a skill directly. Unfortunately people seem to forget that critical thinking is practiced at a high level as part of  science, instead preferring to lump scientific cognition into its own category which is framed as inscrutable to the commoners. If I had to teach people to think critically, I&#x27;d probably use a blend of media/propaganda study, formal logic, scientific method, rhetoric, and literary deconstruction-- I imagine that&#x27;s enough to scare away all but the most determined.",1448731729

You might think you&#x27;re just writing data to a file, but you&#x27;re writing records (the OS adds the prefix for variable records or 0-pads for fixed length).

In fact, this is how new languages are created in the first place. At one point Italy, France and Romania all spoke Vulgar Latin. And French used to be considered the lingua franca to such and extent that it&#x27;s in the damned name of the thing. But no one complains that the Portugese have difficulty understanding the Spanish who can&#x27;t understand the French who can&#x27;t understand the Italians who can&#x27;t understand the Romanians. I&#x27;ve been to a few different English-speaking countries now and I can understand everyone&#x27;s English just fine unless they&#x27;re from a rural area. Doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s rural Ireland or rural Georgia, I&#x27;ll have to ask them to put on a fake accent, no matter how poor it is.<p>English is not particularly strange or unique on most measures. Phonetically it has a few unusual sounds, but every language has one or two (and our most odd sound &quot;th&quot; is found in everything from medieval Japanese to ancient Greek). Grammatically English approaches an analytic language, though nothing quite like Chinese. That means we have fairly sophisticated syntax (meaning attributed to the order of words), but our morphology (the actual words changing according to grammatical meaning like for tense or plurality) is very simple. People from countries where the speak languages with all sorts of genitive and ablative cases with verb agreement on prepositions with an animacy hierarchy (I&#x27;m exaggerating here, obviously) seem to see English as simple.<p>Of course, English isn&#x27;t particularly well-suited to be a lingua franca. If anything our shift toward analyticism is more of a result of England being repeatedly conquered in it&#x27;s early settlement by Germanic tribes followed by English speakers repeatedly conquering everyone else, while embracing multiculturalism. But like most lingua francas, they gain status because of their economic importance and then you have to learn them simply because they&#x27;ve become the lingua franca.<p>I am not optimistic on the idea that a language should emerge that is actually well-suited and designed to be a lingua franca. Esperanto has been around for, what, over a hundred years now or something? And I&#x27;m sure Amiga was technically superior to IBM and in a thousand other format wars the technically superior option never took hold.<p>I&#x27;m just glad that I don&#x27;t have to learn the bastard version of Latin that has grown up in academia and instead my own native language is the standard. There&#x27;s very little you can do to convince me that an 8-syllable compound word formed from the roots of a language that did not allow compounding using word meanings that are grossly different from their original meaning for a common, everyday concept or thing for the sake of &quot;universal standard&quot; is a superior method of doing things.",1448731532

With French, you learn it in school and when you go home.. That&#x27;s it, no more French influences.

According to the theories of language acquisition, it is processing of linguistic input (connecting form to meaning to be able to understand the meaning) that makes the internal, unconscious representation of language to develop.<p>Subtitling movies and TV shows essentially gives more opportunities to encounter linguistic input. However, as the viewers are able to get the meaning from the subtitles only, they don&#x27;t necessarily PROCESS the foreign language. Some do, so the mileage varies a lot.<p>(Watching without subtitles will force you process the meaning – or if the difficulty level is too high, just frustrate and ignore it. Or process partially.)<p>I find that even more than TV shows, kids these days are learning English from games – in Finland, they don&#x27;t translate games at all, so there&#x27;s even greater incentive to actually try to understand the English input.",1448730917

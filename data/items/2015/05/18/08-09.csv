They have frequent outages and are unapologetic when they do. There is no transparency. They have a terrible privacy record (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Se_og_H%C3%B8r_media_scandal"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Se_og_H%C3%B8r_media_scan...</a>). Until last year everyone down to their phone support staff had open access to everyone&#x27;s payment records (see <a href=""http://www.computerworld.dk/art/230818/alle-kundeservice-folk-i-nets-har-adgang-til-foelsomme-kort-data"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.computerworld.dk/art/230818/alle-kundeservice-fol...</a> -- in Danish). Despite all these issues they just laid off a bunch of people. Their only priority, it appears, it making money for the owners.<p>Money is a critical piece of infrastructure and these guys absolutely cannot be trusted to implement it. With more payment processors and a regulatory framework that forced them to provide decent service maybe cashless is not a bad idea. With the current implementation though there&#x27;s a good chance it will be a disaster. It will certainly be a gaping vulnerability for anyone who should feel like targeting us; I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if all it would take to bring the whole thing down is one lone hacker.",1431939429

The claim that you need a detailed record of all transactions in order to maximise tax revenue and stop crime is wrong; you only need a record of the financial aspect - the value of the transaction, when it happened, what was purchased, and what tax was due. You don&#x27;t need any information about <i>who</i> bought the items to ensure the tax is collected properly. You could have a cashless society that respects privacy by making a legal requirement for the details of who made a transaction to be stored separately and anonymously to the tax reporting information. If Denmark&#x27;s system doesn&#x27;t do that then they have made a choice to deliberately limit people&#x27;s privacy.

9563327,comment,9560331,9562680,0,0,waps,,,"> When and how will it end?<p>The situation is caused by the government attempting to control lending cost. This has happened before and it will happen again. Essentially governments are currently attempting to create a massive wealth transfer from, well mostly everybody, to their favored causes (firstly to government spending, and second to property values, through banks). To do this they are taking out what effectively are huge loans.<p>So central banks are painting themselves into a corner. They are making it extremely easy for the government to borrow. Why ? Because this will make it easy for those governments to pay off the debt burden that has become too much for them. Of course governments aren&#x27;t paying off debts at all, rather they are increasing spending (look past the austerity rhetoric to the actual numbers : taking into account that their debt servicing cost is decreasing by a LOT, they&#x27;re actually increasing spending by over 10%, all of them).<p>This makes those debt burdens a lot worse, because that cheap borrowing cost is temporary. Debt that is serviceable at 0.2% interest costs double as much in debt service at 0.4%, which is a tiny change.<p>So the situation becomes more and more unstable. This could last a few years though.<p>So what will happen next. Most/all of the governments in Europe (and the US) will likely end up in the position Greece was in 2 years ago, or worse, due to a tiny rise in interest rates. Then they will default on at least some debt. This will cause an enormous spike in interest rates, so it will become prohibitively expensive for governments to loan money at all, and they will lose the ability to rollover debt. So they either come up with 100% of GDP without loaning money (ie. massive inflation), or they default on more debt. This will crash banks (but don&#x27;t worry : government guarantees have been gutted so it won&#x27;t cost the government anything. Google &quot;bail-in legislation&quot;).<p>At this point interest rates will shoot up to 10%, maybe 20%. All those investment properties in Londen will suddenly be extremely costly to their investors (their monthly payments will double or triple in a year), and go on the market (the problem is not too little housing, the problem is that for the moment it&#x27;s too valuable to invest in real estate, given the rising prices).<p>And then we&#x27;re back in 1992 or so.<p>> buckling themselves in with the student debt and the mortgage to spend their entire adult life under the heel of the capitalists.<p>Sadly, you can be assured of one thing : when this story has played out, you&#x27;ll be worse off than today, for at least a few years. And God help those with student debt, or even worse : those with student debt backed by a state (US, UK, Australia, Netherlands all have large amounts of people with lots of student debt backed by the state).",1431938112

And to clarify, MicroPython targets any environment with ANSI C99 support. It will work on 8-bit or even 1-bit microcontrollers, given enough code storage and RAM.",1431936541

In this the owner of a piece of property can sell a leasehold, which is the right to exclusive use for a set period of time (nowadays it is usually 999 years for residential property, but 99 years used to be common).  At the end of the leasehold ownership rights revert to the freeholder.  This was very convenient for landed nobility, who could re-sell the same land every couple of generations.  The Duke of Westminster did very well out of it.<p>The right of a leaseholder to force sale of the freehold to themselves was introduced a few years ago, so this system will slowly fade.",1431936505

If you write C++ all day you can use C++ for file mungling if you find the libraries you need (for example html-parsing or xml-parsing).<p>I used to write scripts in Ruby since I liked the syntax, it was very easy, nowdays I have tried javascript since I use it anyway in web projects and Node/NPM has a lot of modules ready. One thing I like with scripting languages is that I usually need to tweak the script a bit over time and that is very easy to do with scripting languages, even on different computers which may or may not have a compiler.",1431936484

You don't think it is wrong for an instructor to hold such beliefs? I guess we should have doctors who don't believe in bacteria or scientists who believe in gravity.  <p>The good days of Reddit anyways were when it was comprised of just computer scientists who happen to be Atheists.",1187492267

43972,comment,43635,43753,0,0,mangodrunk,,,"What are you guys talking about? Can you list more than 10 sites in the past few months that were that informative. Yes, startup news is important, but we can't have submissions like ""how to start your company"" every day, because they tend to be the same thing. I enjoy this new take on things, starting the company is the easy part. Having the knowledge at the right time is the hard part. This is also a good way for people to get connected. I possibly need a partner for my startup (based on PG's advice) so maybe I'll find my partner here.",1187490960

Is there any other way to submit your location aside from form submit? What about a set of lat/lons, or selection by clicking on the map, or a drop down for instance?<p>There's gotta be more ways to enter than just by IP.

43967,comment,43686,43869,0,0,jsnx,,,"Public education isn't for the children -- it's for the market.<p>A modest amount of public education protects against small scale market inefficiencies -- quacks selling poison, the illiterate being defrauded by their employers -- thus liberating a lot of spending power which is gobbled up by large scale, centralized market inefficiencies -- the myth of cancer treatment, the American college system, the legally sophisticated defrauding their employees.<p>There is no incentive for the really wealthy -- the people with the people's taxes, their work hours, their confidence -- to put money into education that would only make them harder to control.<p>Knowledge arises as a sort of after thought, and scholarship is a hobby; only in cases where the information asymmetry can be turned to advantage -- in religion, in technology, even in education itself -- does the scholar become a professional. Maybe the wise would be better off hiding their talent instead of making it available for institutional use?

How does it explain soldiers, risking their lives and health for low pay and horrendous working conditions? People working on free open source projects?

In my experience people do things that pretend to be work because the pretend work is easier than the hard work...like developing leads, qualifying prospects, closing sales and developing products people want.<p>On the other hand, if the articles are actually adding value for your customers, then raise prices to keep adding value via the articles.

To me, this reads as if you are you parroting what you might have been told repeatedly. Whether or not the statements are factual is irrelevant. What is important, is that you have embraced the language and are defining yourself with it. Unless you are worshiped like a god, you are usually better off using your own language to define yourself.<p>As a corollary, and possibly not applicable to you, this type of parroting can illicit similar remarks from others, reinforcing this (maybe) incorrect assessment. When someone keeps saying that they have, for example, a lack of attention, people will start to zoom in that feature with laser focus and even the slightest hint of drop in attention will affirm the idea which was placed in their heads. Also, realize that you provide others with an &#x27;easy out&#x27; if they are uncomfortable discussing their real reasons for letting you go. Maybe you just have a bo issue, which can be solved by switching cologne?<p>I am just saying that you should take some distance from this, regain your own language/words/etc. and redefine yourself. I too can be outspoken and direct when it comes to my failings, but I never phrase them as debilitating, shameful, or even &#x27;that big of deal.&#x27; By choosing the right words, by framing things correctly, many flaws can be accepted.",1431046078

9509402,comment,9506512,9507150,0,0,jtzhou,,,"> Why, so you can avoid having to spend more time doing what you specialized in?<p>Yes. Part of enjoying life -- at least for most people -- is taking part in challenges and endeavors in a wide range of activities. If you can work for 4 hours a week and maintain a high income, this would fit the bill but probably not realistic for most people (do you have suggestions besides managing a portfolio of capital, or free-lancing?).  MMM is not saying we should do everything ourselves, but to be smart about what we do save have more time for other activities. This is how humans have been biologically desired over millions of years -- to be adaptable and have a wide range of skills.  Legs for running, hands for climbing and building and fixing physical objects, noses for smelling.  Skills that are unnecessary for simply writing code but useful to use.  The flywheel sounds a bit too mechanical and less in tune with our biological needs.<p>&quot;A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.&quot;

Part of my devotion is the fact I have this beautiful photostream which I have cultivated over almost 10 years, and represents the cream of the crop of photos that I took and chose to share.  There have been times when I thought carefully about which photos I want in my photostream and in what order.

Maybe picassa was a dumping ground, but not Flickr.<p>The initial refresh was appreciated but confusing, and my use of Flickr declined.  It took ages before any decent app at all was available for the Android and iPhone platforms.  They fumbled the Facebook app.<p>Recently my use of Flickr has picked up again, but I&#x27;ve started to consider other services.

And many successful people say, anecdotally, that this is what they do.

The second site was built at Fort Huachuca, Ariz., in 1986. Before 1992, three agencies operated the TARS network: the Air Force, U.S. Customs Service and U.S. Coast Guard. Congress in 1992 transferred management of the system to the Defense Department, with the Air Force as executive agent. Under Air Force management, through contract consolidation and system standardization, the operations and maintenance cost per site was reduced from $6 million in fiscal year 1992 to $3.5 million in 2007.[citation needed] However the Budget Control Act of 2011 slashed funding for the Air Force, which tried to shut down the project.[3] However, the Department of Homeland Security picked up the project and its funding for fiscal year 2014.[4]<p>edit: PS, the Aerostat/Blimps have been listed on aviation sectionals as well, so no, they don&#x27;t file flight plans.",1431044573

Is it worth trying to incorporate it into routine care? Yes, probably, if you have enough cash. Should a hospital pay for a black box machine learning algorithm to make recommendations from a highly polluted, often erroneous and hugely incomplete literature corpus? The alternative put forward by people actually doing the science is that we should try and develop large open source databases/repositories about the significance of genomic findings, and then collect the data about what happens to the patients.",1431044454

My goal is to find something that somebody is selling. There, ads may be relevant to my direct intent.<p>If I am reading a newspaper, I am actively trying to follow the writing on a topic. Somebody trying to sell me something is a distraction from that goal.<p>Scanning newspaper headlines is in theory in between, in that I am searching for something interesting to read. But in practice, I am scanning a particular set of headlines chosen by particular editors who have an understanding of relevancy and story quality that is similar to mine. Paid advertising bypasses that judgment. So again, it works against my goal and for the goal of the advertisers.<p>Twitter&#x27;s in-stream ads are similar to that last case. I have carefully curated list of people whose words I want to read. If I am interested in some brand, I can just follow them. If I might be interested in something not in my feed, I can search for that something or ask people who follow me for help. Ads specifically bypass my meta-editorial judgment in hopes of manipulating my purchasing behaviors.<p>I understand the theory that ads are providing new, relevant information, but I think it&#x27;s mainly false in practice. We live in an age of effectively infinite free information with everybody able to publish, edit, and meta-edit. I&#x27;ve already selected a group of people who are telling me what I think I need to hear.<p>Twitter is inserting the ads not because people are saying, &quot;Hey, I need more relevant stuff.&quot; They&#x27;re getting it whether they want it or not. If ads were really all that valuable, there would be sites where you could just get lots of ads, an online equivalent of the coupon circular.

Searching on &quot;detect IMSI catcher&quot; yields hits for Android, but I see no apps for iOS. AIMSICD looks like a good app. Maybe someone who knows this stuff well can recommend one.<p>It&#x27;s easy to make Faraday bags from aluminum foil.[0] To test, you just put the phone in the bag, and call it. If it rings, there are leaks. It&#x27;s important to turn the phone off before putting it in the Faraday bag. That will prevent rapid battery discharge through high-power attempts to reach towers.<p>The hardest aspect is getting good electrical contact on all seams, including the access flap. The maximum dimension of any hole in the bag must be small, less than 1-2 cm. A gap at the seam that&#x27;s 1-2 cm long, even if it&#x27;s very narrow, will leak (re-radiate) a lot.<p>The other thing to keep in mind is that aluminum foil gets brittle with bending, and will crack. So you need multiple layers, and the layers must be in electrical contact. Narrow strips of double-stick tape between layers are OK to provide structural stability.

If you know what magic is, it is mastery of all the elements, and a deliberate attempt to weave. If is for that reason one wouldn&#x27;t want to reveal too much, because the magic would lose its allure and wouldn&#x27;t be as effective. It seems newcomer bloggers, artists, designers...they sell us out by giving away too many secrets. Old media is quick to call them &#x27;wiz kids&#x27; and say &#x27;fair play&#x27; for making that app, but I think it&#x27;s too much too soon. There is a loose Internet rule we can apply called &#x27;lurk moar&#x27; that is the most under applied trick in the book. The premise is that you do your homework on everybody, every thing, and every trick you are about to conjure. Life is a dress rehearsal, and there are endless lives we can live to perfect it all and achieve mastery. I just think all these artists, designers, and creatives need to slow down a bit. I am not saying stop sharing tutorials, and not saying sharing is inherently bad. I just want to see some restraint. I know it can be hard to retain clients and we have to keep the game in play by sharing what we&#x27;ve learned, and telling our story, but not to such an extreme that anyone off the street can read your whole blog from start to finish and then (literally) become just as good as the next guy and perform all the same tricks...<p>Am I the only one who feels this way, or is this the new normal and I need to find somewhere else I can compete?",1431043252

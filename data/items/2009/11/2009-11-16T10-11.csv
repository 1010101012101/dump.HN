944264,comment,943910,943910,0,0,Erwin,,,"64-bit made things worse, especially if using interpreted languages which often have convenient but complexly indirect structures.<p>E.g. creating this:<p><pre><code>       d = dict((x,x * 42) for x in xrange(100000))
</code></pre>
a dictionary with 100k items in Python, takes up 10996 kB RSS memory on my 64-bit system, but 5200 kB RSS on a 32-bit Python (same Python version). You've got your dictionary hash buckets, the integer objects etc, all separately allocated objects. The integers themselves are also 64-bit.<p>Of course, if I really cared about the memory in the above case I'd create an array or even a list that fit the key/value pattern; the array array.array('i', (x*42 for x in xrange(100000))) stores the same information in the maximally compact form increasing RSS by about 500k.<p>But given a production system with 32G of memory memory optimisation is rarely being made.",1258368673

I too sometimes think, ""damn I would be much further along now if I had gotten into this stuff earlier."" But then I guess I wouldn't be the person I am in other ways and mostly, I don't mind who I am.<p><i>I'm still learning new things on regular basis</i><p>If that's the case, then I'd say you're OK at the moment.

I always try to incorporate promising new platforms/technologies into new side projects both as a way to learn and as a way to test the technology.<p>You won't use everything you play with, but over time, your toolset and skill will grow and you'll be able to deliver better and more unique solutions that will get you noticed.  Capitalize on that by doing a brown bag or by helping other teams when they follow the scent of success. Rinse/Repeat. In 7-8 years, everyone will know that you're indispensable.",1258368474
944261,comment,944040,944040,0,0,Tichy,,,"Don't follow every new trend. However, if you are stuck in .NET world, it might really pay off to look at other worlds for inspiration now and then.<p>Reading Hacker News now and then should give you enough ideas? Every now and then you could read a book or do some exercises, or best create a small project in another technology stack.<p>I think reading SICP and learning a bit of LISP might be a good start - just because it introduces a lot of concepts that might be unheard of by enterprise programmers.<p>If I was on .NET I would probably be looking at F# right now.",1258368320

944254,comment,944040,944068,0,0,jonny_noog,,,"<i>Newer technology isn't always better.</i><p>This is a great point that one would think obvious enough, except that there's usually some pretty powerful vested interests that I suspect like to try hard to obscure it in order to keep users and devs on the constant upgrade treadmill, in turn padding their bottom line.<p>Case in point: My favourite Linux distro Debian, knows newer isn't always better very well. They are sometimes criticised for their stable release being ""behind the times"", but if you want the cutting edge you can pretty easily run the Debian Testing or Unstable releases (even Unstable is pretty stable most of the time). What people don't get or perhaps don't want to accept is that Debian stable values stability over all else, it's meant for server applications and the fact that it's a bit ""behind the times"" makes it better for this role than it would be otherwise.",1258367970
944253,comment,944051,944200,0,0,snprbob86,,,"That is super interesting! Thanks for sharing.<p>Sadly, however, none of these techniques alone will work on a widely spider-able site. If you have a sufficiently large pool of visible email addresses, it suddenly becomes worth while to crack your single method and spider you specifically. I'd prefer to show email addresses in plain text, but if a client begins requesting them too quickly, replace them with a link which pops up a javascript blockade with a captcha.<p>That said, one of these methods is probably worth using for a single email address on a personal site. However, my email address has been widely distributed in plain text for several years and Gmail has more or less solved the spam problem for me.",1258367885
944252,comment,943939,943939,0,0,jacquesm,,,"If it wouldn't be for the scumbags running the media industry I'm sure file sharing would not have gotten as much traction as it did. Now that some of the more sordid details are becoming publicly known the public will find less and less reasons to be swung by the crocodile tears of the media industry.<p>For me the piece by Janis Ian was an eye opener, the movie or the music industry does not seem to make much difference in general when it comes to their attitude to the general public.<p>It's all about money, and it really doesn't matter whether they'll get it from you legally, by hook or by crook.<p>If I ever get into a really bad mood I'm going to set up a service where you can order hard drives with 'random' bits on them at cost.",1258367863

944249,comment,943939,944143,0,0,Erwin,,,"Well, if you acted in good faith I'm sure that would be a fair defense. For example, buying stolen goods is illegal in most countries. If you're buying something used for 60% of retail price off a classifieds site that turns to be stolen, that would in be good faith. You might lose the stolen item in any case, but you would not be prosecuted.<p>Similarly if you were downloading a black & white movie off some official looking site that claims to collect out-of-copyright films.<p>But if you're downloading a 2009 blockbuster off Pirate Bay using BitTorrent, that's clearly malicious. But it's not even that kind of case that's being civilly prosecuted by RIAA and its ilk -- it's only when you start uploading this material to others that they strike.<p>Personally I find the behaviour of many of the pirates pathethic. Just admit that you want ready access to material that was expensive to create for free already, don't make some nonsensical claims about free speech or restrictive copyrights or oppressive record companies.<p>Want to fight exploitive record companies? Buy only music from independents, support those band tours'. Ignore newest pop albums from RIAA companies. Tell everyone how great your independent band is, play their music at parties.<p>Want to oppose restrictive copyrights? Make everything you create true Public Domain. Microsoft using your PD code in a commercial product? Great, your work is being put to good use.",1258367577

Other than that, I think the netbook argument makes a ton of sense. Even on my fullsized screen, I hate scrolling down really long pages. I also think that it's silly that if you have a really long page the scroll ""sensitivity"" will be much higher in a traditional scrollbar. I use the mousepad scroller more often for that reason.",1258367326

I'm pretty sure the former is true, newspapers are as good as dead, but I think journalism has a glowing future, only not in the 'I'm employed by a big newspaper' sense.<p>Journalists will probably evolve to become independent professionals charging top dollar for their output with online outlets bidding up against each other for the right to 'scoop'. That way even investigative journalism has a chance to survive.<p>It will require journalists to become more business savvy.",1258367199

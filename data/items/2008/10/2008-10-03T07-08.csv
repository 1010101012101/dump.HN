322537,comment,321585,321585,0,0,psnajder,,,"I'm in the middle of the Einstein bio by Isaacson, who uses many of the documents referred to in this 2006 article to paint Einstein's private life as it complimented his public works.  (I certainly recommend the book to you all!)<p>One of Isaacson's main points is that it was not mere intellect that made Einstein superior.  Great scientists, such as Poincare, were working in the same fields at the same time, but were conditioned within the realm of university research to hold on strong to the classical beliefs of Newtonian science.  The four papers Einstein wrote in 1905 (written during his patent office period while he was essentially blacklisted from a position at a university) each had the benefit of his outsider voice.  While his work in college was above average, it did not translate into genius until Einstein had the ability to generate, on his own, a complete theory of how he intellectually envisioned the world.  More important than Einstein's given intellect was his particular perspective.<p>Anyways, I find judging intelligence by means of a test is absolutely pointless; IQ, in particular, measures only a few ways that a person can be intelligent.<p>In conclusion, as always: Genius is as genius does.",1223020622

Social networking is not an area I am interested in, but I happen to have previously listened to the eGuardian episode of the Frank Peters Show, and it popped into my head when you mentioned security problems with social-networking sites for 14-year-olds.<p>Another point about market opportunity: some high-school and college students go to same-sex institutions (which might be a good idea, since it minimizes distraction, and hence could become more popular over time).",1223019946

322530,comment,321997,322193,0,0,helveticaman,,,">It is a first time in history that such ridiculous numbers are summoned.<p>Not true.  In 1984, in Chile, there was a shitstorm that warranted a 14 billion dollar bailout.  Chile's population was ~12M, so the bailout was just over a thousand dollars per capita.  Now, the bailout in US is over two thousand dollars per capita (700B/300M), and between 1984 and today, the dollar has lost about half its purchasing power (or more, depending on who you ask).  So, it's about the same size.  Keep in mind Chileans were, and still are, much poorer than Americans are today.  So yes, there have been bailouts this size.<p>On a side note, the Chilean bailout was a success.  But then, the Chilean Ministerio de Hacienda (Fed, basically) was really big on Friedman and the Chicago School in general.  Plus, historically, it has always kept its shit together.  Don't know if this is the case with the Federal Reserve.",1223019722

Sure, and it undoubtedly does, but we recognize how rare this is, and understand that The Moment is much more likely to occur face to face.<p>FlowMingle is all about consistently providing you with a group of eligible, interested, and feasible people, helping you get to know them a bit, then facilitating some type of direct contact.  Essentially, we want to provide you with as many opportunities as possible for The Moment to occur, by lowering the cost of finding a date.  Most people do not consistently meet and interact with 10 other interested people in a week, and in this way FlowMingle is a very efficient use of your time.<p>We do not believe it is our job, or even within our ability, to 'create love', 'find your soulmate', 'provide a sure-thing hookup', etc.  Instead, we focus on leveraging what the web does best(sharing information, facilitating communication, bringing people together, organizing activity) to help you do what you do best, face to face.",1223018338

Better just to make him as self-aware as I can.<p>Actually regarding Creationism, I think the world was created in 7 days, except each day took two alternate lengths.<p>1: if you were standing in it then millions of years, and<p>2: if you were standing out of it from God's perspective, exactly 24 hours. The days may in fact run simultaneously. From God's perspective, it's a bit like running 7 DVDs players in fast forward from your couch so that each one only runs for 24 hours of viewing time, but as an actor within the film it could be a few million years story time depending on how fast it was fast-forwarded from the couch and how the scenes progressed in the storyline.<p>My point: Creationism and evolution are not mutually exclusive when one's frame-of-reference for viewing the universe's startup events can switch between alternate yet equally valid perspectives.",1223018184

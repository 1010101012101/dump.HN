I'm a 27-year-old woman and I left a cushy (read: boring) job writing for Vogue magazine so I could create a dating site that women will actually feel proud to join.  Like so many, I was under the assumption you had to have ninja coding skills, an MBA, Google on your resume, or a genius gene to become a founder.  I had none of those, and having worked as a print journalist, I missed the boat on the importance of developing your online brand.  I had nothing to give me credibility--not even a Twitter page.  And let's face it, my one laurel, ie that shiny ""Vogue"" on my resume, meant nothing to this audience.<p>I tried to get a job at a startup just to see what I was getting myself into, and no one would hire me.  I had pretty much one friend in the biz--Meetup's cofounder Matt Meeker--and once he heard my idea, he said, ""You've got to do this.""  I said, ""But I don't have experience or any sort of reputation,"" and he said, ""The best and most efficient way to get those things is to just do it.""<p>So, I'm doing it.  I probably wouldn't have if Matt hadn't offered those words of wisdom and created such an unthreatening environment in which to pitch him.  The other thing that helped me plow forward when I wanted to give in to all the judgmental haters out there was the research I did on what sort of skills investors look for in the entrepreneurs they fund.  If more women knew that it's about PERSPIRATION and PERSEVERANCE above all, I truly believe we'd have more female founders.<p>I've always had that fire in the belly that makes for a good entrepreneur.  If it weren't for the misconceptions that you have to be some sort of savant to start something, I would have, like Jessica, maybe done this at 25.  Though I've got a lot of catching up to do, I'm so thankful I realized I CAN do this, I SHOULD do this (to gain experience if nothing else), and I WANT to do this--because if I pull this off, I'll have accomplished something 100x more gratifying than anything I could have ever done working in corporate.",1296082669

Growing the market is more important than trying to maximize your share of the market. You don't want to have the smallest piece of the pie, but sacrificing a little bit of your share in exchange for a larger pie can be a win.<p>In knowledge businesses like consulting, educating customers often means educating competitors simultaneously. However, it can still be a win to share knowledge.<p>Finally, one must consider brand. Sometimes you trade knowledge for brand. If you write about programming, you may make your competitors better programmers. Some clients may feel empowered to write their own code instead of hiring a consultant. But your brand can now open opportunities for you that didn't exist before.<p>I guess what I'm saying is that knowledge is power, but sharing it can be an investment under certain circumstances.",1296082552

Do you think they would prefer to deal with online support requests from clients or talk to them in person at their store?<p>Having an in person or live conversation is almost always more costly.  Yes, it likely cuts down on the number of miniscule requests that you will receive, but you are likely to get a large number of those via telephone, unless you don't offer that as well, which would be impossible for offsite property managers.<p>So, in short, yes, I agree with you that the number of silly requests may go up, especially initially.  However, to counter this, sorting them takes all of 5 seconds a piece instead of 5 min to listen to them ramble on the phone, the benefits of online rental payments saves you time and money, and the instant organization that comes from having this all flow into one system is in our eyes, priceless.<p>Thanks for your valuable input!",1296082529

2145625,comment,2145250,2145474,0,0,unoti,,,"> Would you wager there is more software written that is not web related and that it collectively makes more money than the stuff that is?<p>Absolutely.  Software that runs warehouses. Payrolls. Manages inventory. Manages cash registers. Figures out how to optimize manufacturing across multiple vendors, multiple workstations. Robotics. Warehouse automation and robotics. Embedded systems. 3d rendering.  Automated trading.  Inventory control.  Lot control.  Pharmaceutical side effects tracking. Call centers, customer service...<p>Each of those, and ten thousand more, are all not web related, and each one of those has large communities of developers bigger than hacker news that bend their minds each and every day to the tasks at hand, and they're mostly not web related.  Obscene amounts of money change hands every year for creating, maintaining, installing, and customizing all of those kinds of software.<p>Oracle's annual revenue is something like $100 billion, and it's just one player in a few of the above markets I mentioned.  I'm not sure what SAP makes.  But then also factor in the myriad of middlemen, integrators, and contractors, and it's a really large sum of money that goes into those things.<p>Web type businesses get more buzz because there is far more comparatively easy low-hanging fruit for effort vs. reward with a typical web business than in the world of enterprise software.  Things like supply chain optimization are comparatively more mature and hashed out than things like making people's lives easier with computers, or connecting people and information in new and enriching ways.<p>There's still room for innovation in warehousing and so on, but the changes are more incremental, and you have to work harder for each advance than you do with web type companies.  The progress still comes, and impacts our lives (witness Wal-Mart, lowering prices for everyone through awesome, difficult, supply chain optimization efforts), but it takes way more work to make a difference than it does with ""web"" businesses.",1296082224

Though (and again I'm sorry for continuing to blab about this, but I don't often get the opportunity) I think it's actually a bit more tricky. When it was published, EPR showed that action by contact (the separation principle) and the _completeness_  of QM can't both be valid. At least, this was Einstein's intention with EPR - in letters to Schrodinger he expresses his chagrin with the way Podolsky, who wrote the paper, buried Einstein's main point in technicalities.<p>Now, when you say he derived conclusions he didn't believe were true, that's kind of wrong, since all he derived was a dilemma (completeness or separation, not both (but possibly neither)). He took this to show that if we maintain the separation principle, then QM needs to be viewed as a statistical account of objects with properties it can't describe (but he never took that to mean hidden variable theories like Bohm's were the answer).<p>So, my point is, he believed in the correctness of QM (just not in the completeness). He believed in QM being true - just not that is was the whole truth. He believed in the correctness of the EPR derivation and in the correctness of the dilemma at the end. When you say he used a theory he didn't believe was correct, I think that's wrong - he just didn't believe it was the finished article. And when you say he derived conclusions he didn't believe were true, I think that's wrong too, since he derived a dilemma that he very much believed in. In the end he chose the wrong side, but that's not relevant here.<p>You say Einstein believed this was a reductio ad absurdum - but that's flat out wrong I think. EPR relates to the completeness of the formalism (if the separation principle is taken to be true), not the correctness.",1296081401

I don't know many people here in the industry (just one Stanford CS professor, who is a close friend). I'm looking for intelligent, imaginative, and brave engineers who have an appreciation for irony and distaste for blind status quo. I deeply respect Graham, DeMarco, Brooks, Weinberg and Spolsky.

I did not write that the one leads to the other.<p>> This is also completely contrary to reality. If there is someone who believes that everyone not in their religion is ""evil"", it must be an incredibly small fringe group along with flat earthers and apollo mission deniers.

""Evil"" is an exaggeration, but let's say ""immoral"" or at the very least ""misguided"".<p>The point I was trying to make is this:<p>1) The primary vector for religious belief is parenting. Yes, people sometimes adopt a faith later in life, but this dwarfed by those who practice the faith of their parents.
2) This vector depends on the child having other adults and mentors (a community) around them who are also religious, or at the very least a community that doesn't mock religion as ridiculous and/or insane.
3) As more and more respectable people who are not obviously ""other"" are un- or anti-religious, it's harder to get kids to believe their religious teachings
3b) Or at least, it erodes their authority from Religion (capital R) to mere tradition.<p>> Yet you assert this is a majority belief.<p>Where? Where are you reading this stuff?<p>> This means you are irrational and believe in things that are demonstrably false, does it not?<p>Try again.

""Anything I talk about is almost certain to be something I'm resolutely against, and it seems to me the best way of opposing it is to understand it, and then you know where to turn off the button."" The popular image of McLuhan (and he was extremely popular - up there with rock stars) was definitely not that of a button-turner-offer.<p>Such a mindset in many critics would make them predictable and boring, but to me it makes McLuhan more interesting. The knock against him was always that he was glib, but this suggests a depth that isn't obvious.<p>I remember hearing that McLuhan was once at an academic conference where some professor excoriated him after his talk (McLuhan was loathed by his fellow academics). McLuhan shrugged and said, ""You don't like these ideas? I got others.""",1296080141

Indeed, the enthusiastic way that Lispers describe macros I find eerily similar to how I used to hear Forthians describe their language. Except in Forth the relevant term isn't macro but ""defining word"". Indeed, I think programmers in both camps see the proper use of macros/defining words as a sign that one has passed the beginner stage of using the language.<p>A classic compiled Forth word (ie, function) would consist of the word's name followed a string of addresses to execute; how those addresses were laid down, where they pointed, etc. were totally open to programmer control -- both during compilation and afterwards. It's been a couple of decades since I looked at Forth code, but I don't think there's anything that could be done in Lisp macros that couldn't also be done easily in Forth as well.<p>I think the big difference between the two -- at least, so far as the macro topic goes -- is that Lisp starts with an assumption that code and data can and should be interchangeable while Forth was initially developed for the machine control (embedded systems before they were called embedded systems) and thus code was merely a vehicle for creating applications.",1296079728

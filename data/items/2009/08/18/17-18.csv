771015,comment,770942,770942,0,0,ggchappell,,,"Okay, he is saying that the time required for an arithmetic operation is proportional to the number of bits operated on.<p>This is true, and it is applicable to other concepts besides hash tables. Can you sort n numbers in O(n log n)? Well a comparison is not really constant-time, in the wall-clock sense of time. If the n numbers are distinct, then each is going to need at least O(log n) bits. So a comparison is O(log n) by the clock, and our sort becomes O(n log n log n).<p>Part of the solution is to be more precise. For example, when we say that Merge Sort is O(n log n), we usually do not mean that it takes that long to run; we mean that it can require <i>that many comparisons</i>. Counting primitive operations can be useful, even if those operations are not constant-time from a wall-clock point of view. And as long as we are clear on what the primitive operations are, everything is fine.<p>By the way, there is another problem with the statement that hash-table insertion is amortized constant-time: what if all the keys end up being in the same bucket? The true statement is that HT insertion is amortized constant-time <i>for average data</i>. (So it's constant-time on average on average. :-)",1250618050

770987,comment,770735,770735,0,0,kragen,,,"This is pure hype, abusing the term ""nanotechnology"" to mean something like ""any technology depending on nanometer-scale features"". I recently made a list of such technologies:<p>Obsidian knives (Aztec empire): sharpness comes from ≈3nm edge thickness.<p>Soap bubbles (Roman empire): low average density is due to surface film of 50–1000nm thickness, as evidenced by iridescence.<p>Iron (Iron Age): stable in air because it forms a magnetite film about 5nm thick, or thicker if heated.<p>Jell-O (commercialized around WWII, but of course present in roasting pans for many centuries): its consistency is a result of a liquid-filled foam with pore sizes in the single-nanometer to hundreds-of-nanometer range.<p>Montmorillonite clay (discovered 1847): its effectiveness in expanding when it absorbs water is a result of plate-size crystal particles that may be hundreds of nanometers wide, but are only a nanometer or so thick. Currently used in my cat litter box, as a reinforcer in many plastics, for sealing landfills against leakage, and for splitting rocks, among other things.<p>Homogenized milk (1900): the milkfat doesn't separate because it's in particles that are small enough for Brownian motion to keep them from floating to the top, which means 200–2000 nanometers. Milk also naturally contains casein micelles of 10–300nm in size, but that's not ""technology"".<p>Gold leaf (ancient Egypt?): 30–100 nm in thickness.<p>Pottery (prehistoric): made of clay, which is often defined as dirt with particle size of under 2000 nm. (Some people use a stricter definition that additionally requires certain minerals.) Larger particle sizes don't form plastic colloids when mixed with water. As mentioned above under ""montmorillonite"", some clays have much smaller particle sizes.<p>Asbestos crystals will fracture into fibers down to the nanometer range; this is the problem with them.<p>(Talcum powder is much larger: 10 000 nm or so.)<p>(And of course there's all the stuff we make with X-ray lithography, and there's data on hard disks, but they don't support my point that the kind of ""nanotechnology"" being touted here is nothing fundamentally new.)",1250617453

However, we must realize that it's not just some silly idea someone dreamed up one day. Tenure has real economic value to those who get it.

770959,comment,770464,770464,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Since Javascript VMs have been making such strides lately, I've been thinking of implementing a Smalltalk VM on top of Javascript.  If you JIT bytecodes to Javascript source, you'll be running at the ""native"" speed of the Javascript, and Smalltalk without the source code is extraordinarily compact.  (About 10X and sometimes 100X over the equivalent C++ code.)  But bytecodes fully decompile into source, just without the temporary variable names.  A dictionary of the temp names for each method can be dynamically loaded later in the background, or just applied to stack traces at a later time by devs to aid debugging.  To get even more compression, you can replace the message symbols with integers.<p>This would be a relatively easy task.  A Smalltalk bytecode VM is really just a loop with a size 256 case statement, plus garbage collection.  The GC and object allocation could just use Javascript's.  Likewise, the UI could just piggyback on top of Javascript and HTML.",1250616728

If we assume for a moment that the quoted JFK speech was actually written by JFK (and not by a speechwriter), you've actually proven you're better at penning inspiring words than JFK was.  The sentiments in the JFK speech are rousing and inspiring enough that they overcame the wording at the time they were uttered to the world, but the phrasing itself is clumsy and distracting.  ""And the other things""?  Seriously?  I've never liked that speech, but I like the passion expressed in this call for a better Web, and it is not as marred as JFK's wording by a long shot.<p>2. I think a far better idea than using gateway providers is coming up with a way to store the data locally (on your own computer) and authorize (or not) particular Websites to access particular parts of it.  You have to develop a protocol that can be used by visited Websites to access the data when they are authorized to do so, anyway; why not make it a protocol that definitively keeps the stored data in your own hands?  Either way, the real challenge will be getting the visited Websites to refrain from storing the data in violation of your wishes once they get the data, but if I got to keep the data in encrypted form on my own computer I'd be much more likely to want to get on board with the idea.",1250616686

I know what you want to say, I should do this from the start, right? But then I'd end up with a bunch of useless indexes who eat up update times and space.<p>Second step is usually cache - local, in-application cache. It's pretty much auto-pilot now, writing a cache function.<p>Cache helps, but not as much as you'd think. When it gets serious though it's still useful because its shape makes it easy to go to step three: mix the cache with a bit of refactoring. This can mean simply pre-fetching: there is a huge difference from doing 20 ""select * from order_items where id=xxx"" and just one ""select * from order_items where order=yyy"". And with the cache in place it usually means only a few extra lines of code. (This example is for building reports, not for displaying orders. I'm not that of an idiot to get each order_item separately).<p>If things get heavy refactoring can go as far as breaking the abstractions in place. Last month I squeezed an extra second by sending to the browser a big table in batches, while I was computing it. Not something I want to do every day, but occasionally it's fun.<p>This is also the step when I usually realize I made a stupid mistake along the way which caused the delay.<p>The only problem I met which was mostly impervious to this was a design decision. In one app I decided (as I usually do) to compute stuff like balances and debts on-the-fly. It usually (well, always) is a good idea, because any intermediary result is a source for bugs. But this particular app grew rather unexpectedly large, with the result that computing an overall balance takes 3-10 seconds. It's not a huge problem for the client, but my pride suffers. I'm still looking into this one - I think some refactoring may make it ok.",1250616544

How long is it in your favorite language?\n</code></pre>\nSo instead of measuring lines of code, you measure the size of the AST. Works well for Lisp, at least; not sure how well it generalizes to other languages.",1250615304

However, the problem is finding motivation for regular users to sacrifice, and if they wont then you need the big corporations to sacrifice to get there.\nHow can we find motivation for either part?<p>I think this will be an extremely long process that is slowly happening on a minor scale, but that we will never see a fully open web - ever - just because of the lack of motivation from its central actors: users and providers.<p>Things like Wikipedia, OpenID/OAuth, FluidDB, more open API-s (although we don't own the data) are all pointers to the web maybe being more semi-transparent in the future. I mean, things are getting more open, but it will simply never be fully open, no matter how much us developers and geeks want it.\nIf however someone like google or apple were to find a model were they could still earn their money while being transparent and open, then I would start believing.<p>The best way to facilitate this process is by doing your part by implementing your site/service in an open and transparent way.

In fact, I think there would still be piracy if music was free behind a sign-in wall, just like I still click off nytimes.com any time it presents me with a sign-in page EVEN THOUGH I HAVE AN ACCOUNT. It simply isn't worth my trouble. Similarly, people who copy whole mp3 players worth of music will continue to do so, because it's a heck of a lot easier than going online to a website (because presumably ads would be the last hope of making money on music if it was free) and picking songs or albums out one by one.<p>2. Any song that people actually care about downloading will, by defintion, quickly reach 98 cents at Amie St. Sure, you can snag song that 15000 people care about for less, but then again, only 15000 people care.

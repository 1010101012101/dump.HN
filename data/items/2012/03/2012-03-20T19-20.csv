I can speak from personal experience about novels.<p>A common form of encumbrance is territorial rights; for example, when I sell the rights to publish my novels to my publishers, I only sell them the right to publish in a specific language, and in specified territories.<p>I can't get more money from a publisher by offering them world English language rights rather than, by splitting US/Canadian and UK/rest of world rights and selling them to different local publishers. (In fact, if I sell world rights to a US publisher, they won't sell the ebooks around the world -- they'll merely re-sell UK rights to a British publisher, who will maintain the territorial split. Because there are still no truly global publishers, despite individual members of the Big Six trying to operate on a global scale.) So I split the rights and sell them separately.<p>As noted by, well, just about everyone, this makes little or no sense in the internet age. Unfortunately trying to get book contracts re-drafted so that e-book rights are global and non-exclusive is, shall we say, an exercise in pain (we're talking about getting publishing house lawyers involved: do I need to say any more?). So that's why it persists in ebooks, and it's pretty much the same story with other forms of content.<p>That's why this goes on. It'll probably continue for a few more years before truly global distributors show up and the existing system collapses under its own weight.",1332273579

Bastards! ;-)<p>Without mentioning that whenever Apple or Microsoft (or even Canonical with Ubuntu) releases a new operating system, there's almost always hardware that ran the older version but won't run the new hotness. Or if it can run the new thing, it can't take advantage of all the new features. This has been true in the computer industry for decades; it's nothing new.<p>It's less controversial, but how about that Mountain Lion requires modern graphics capabiity and hardware that can boot a 64-bit kernel? <a href=""http://osxdaily.com/2012/02/16/os-x-10-8-mountain-lion-system-requirements/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://osxdaily.com/2012/02/16/os-x-10-8-mountain-lion-syste...</a>.

While free now, how do you plan to monetize. This is important for prospective users because time invested in your application could be wasted if you don't have an end goal in mind and end up discontinuing the product and making it unavailable for use.
I think it's important for users to know that you are getting ""something"", to avoid a gowalla situation where you sign up 1000s of users and then can't convert.<p>So basically... I think that you should provide some insight into how you plan to charge. ie. Flat rate of X per month or something.<p>2) What's the page overhead. ie, While super easy, is it all loaded AMD style and super lightweight. What dependencies do you have. ie jQuery.<p>3) As a suggestion, you shouldn't just ""encrypt"" your JS source for this. I've just ""decrypted"" in about 15 seconds. Since everything you are doing is basically just JavaScript, you should consider implementing something like Typekit/Optimizely for how they serve up their JS files. If you don't want to go through this route, which would be perfectly understandable, then you should at least build your javascript, using something like closure or shrinksafe. But what you did by wrapping it in eval() is as good as useless and pointless. (EDIT, actually I can see you have shrinksafed it. I didn't actually look passed your CSS styles).<p>Overall, It works well, quite impressive.",1332271622

I laid out my position above, but your case is that actually I accept unquestioningly the facts and opinions approved by the scientific establishment. On the contrary, I am a sceptic, in the original (non climate-related) sense.<p>If the US government ran the scientific community, that community would not have its strong consensus on climate change, because half of congress, and every other president, is committed to at least equivocating on whether that consensus exists. I'm afraid the link you posted does not cast Chris de Freitas in a positive light. If I knew of sloppy science that had been passed through peer review, I'd expect the person responsible to be excoriated, much more so if that work contradicted my own. This would not make me wrong, or the editor in question some kind of victim.<p>You have one good point though - money, be it from government or corporations, distorts the process. The procedures for the allocation of fund lead to too much being done in some areas, not enough in others. The academic economics profession has been a particular victim of this. The trouble with the idea that climate science has fallen victim to a grand counterfactual groupthink (if you don't like the 'c' word) is that the numbers, the physics, and the reasoned opinions of the vast majority of apolitical observers support the climate consensus.<p>As for Soviet science: did the Soviet Union promulgate any kind of <i>false</i> science that you're aware of?

I don't know what they were thinking when they decided not to use attributes, but come on, XML is not that bad.<p>> Java 8 is even planning on using Project Jigsaw to get rid of it (IIRC).<p><i>Wrong</i>: Jigsaw is a modularity tool, maven is a build tool. Jigsaw is intended as a competitor to OSGi, not maven. Jigsaw won't compile your project, resolve your dependencies nor deploy your product.<p>> Something like Grape or Buildr would be a better model.<p>I beg to differ. I'm no big fan of maven either, but the idea behind it is pure genius, i.e. an implicit source layout and build lifecycle. Where in imperative  tools like ant and co you'd need to repeat again and again the same snippets, compile all those files in the src dir into a bin dir, copy a bunch of resource files to the bin dir, package the whole thing in a jar or a war, place it in a target dir. Also, the dependencies management used to be a tedious task, with you hunting for the correct versions of jars, placing them in a lib directory, going as far as to version them. Most tools now tend to emulate maven's way of dependency management.<p>Nothing like this with maven: you just place your code and resources in standard locations, create a pom.xml file with just infos regarding your project (name, version and type), possibly the dependencies, and with standard commandes (mvn install for example), it will fetch the dependencies, build your porject, package it and install it.<p>Maven has its warts: verbose XML, unexpected behaviour in some cases, hard to customize (mostly when you try hard not to follow the standards), etc. But these are minor and fixable issues compared to the value it provides to countless developers who could fetch a project source and build it with one standard command.",1332270389

I'll be making more money than I've ever made, which I'm mostly very happy about but has also been a source of some unexpected stress and confusion for me. I feel like I've learned a lot about computers but not so much about managing income.<p>How can I be smart about putting away much of what I make in order to someday buy a house, send kids to college, retire, etc.? Where do I put that money? How do I decide whether to spend a paycheck on a nicer TV or bigger apartment instead of putting it in a 401k? Do I keep doing my own taxes or should I hire a professional?<p>I know many of you were once in my position, or in a similar position. What advice do you have for someone who is about to no longer be living stipend-to-stipend?<p>Thanks!",1332270244

The Drawium annotations look a bit too similar to the content. Maybe that is because the background color of the demo page is close to that of the annotations, or maybe it is because the annotations appear to be in the same layer as the highlighted content (perhaps a light-color shadow would make the annotations stand out more?). It would be more difficult to implement, but I wonder if having a softer edge around highlighted content would help (gradient fade to black). Or maybe add a shadow around the highlighted area to ""raise"" it out of the page?<p>Maybe timed transitions would help. What if the transparent overlay fades in around the content being shown before the tooltip, rather than appearing instantly and at the same time? Isolate first, then explain. I see that the API offers additional options. It would be nice if the demo tour on the homepage includes a variety of these options.<p>I also instinctively tried to use the left/right arrow keys on my keyboard navigate through the demo tour. Next/previous key bindings may helpful.<p>It's not clear how far along in the tour I was. How many elements is the tour explaining? Do I have to click ""Next"" a hundred more times? What if there is a number somewhere in each annotation showing progress (eg. ""3/8"").",1332270166

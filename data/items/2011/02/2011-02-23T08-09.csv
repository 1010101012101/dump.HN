This means the price we see for a smart phone tracks very close to its value.  You cannot do without health care.  If you get sick you will pay any and every price to get well.  If you die, your money is worthless anyway.  A market you cannot opt out of is inelastic and normal free market forces wont be able to find the correct price as they would in a more elastic market.",1298451555

2253544,comment,2253344,2253515,0,0,cscotta,,,"Absolutely - thanks, Matt. This is a very well-written, thorough article, and it provides a clear, thoughtful survey of the landscape for folks who are interested in parallelizing their programs and learning more about the advantages and tradeoffs implicit in different approaches. This piece has a lot of potential to catalyze thought within the community about how best to move forward.<p>The explosion of interest in the subject intrigues me. The work that's been going on in terms of making mainstream Ruby libraries threadsafe is great to see, along with fibers and evented approaches. MacRuby's exposure of Grand Central is especially unique. But interest and upvotes must also be followed by action. There will be a lot of false starts. We'll probably see a handful of approaches which bloom and fade from popularity. While the ""fragmentation"" issue is there, I tend to think of it in terms of spirited experimentation. In any case, people really care now, and it's that drive that forces a community forward. That's good to see.<p>Keep it up!",1298451504

I agree with your anecdotes and have observed similar events and people.<p>Still, if the highly abstract programmer competency follows a normal distribution (and I admit a leap of faith there), you'll agree with me that half of the programmers out there will end up below the average. You'll also agree with me that just above the average doesn't make a good programmer, so, most of the programmers around us will be bad ones.<p>I don't believe you were downvoted for saying painful truths (which I don't think you did), but more on the form of your statement. I believe most downvoters didn't pass the first sentence. I believe this is a good thing - poor form is bad for discussion. We shouldn't get emotional.",1298451240

If you say it's hard to measure then how do you know that get the same outcomes?<p>""Number of procedures per capita per year"" is a horrible measure. It assumes that procedures done is a good proxy for overall health, which it isn't. Public health (clean food and water, trash pickup, promoting exercise and outside activities, cutting down on smoking, etc) is also important.<p>Here's a scenario. Country A and B are identical except that country A has pushed for potable water and B has not. As a result, 10% of the procedures in country B are from dysentery, cholera, and other water-borne diseases which are relatively cheap to treat (keep hydrated with a solution of salts and sugar). As a result, country B has more doctor visits per capita, and on average these costs are cheaper than in country A. Country B also has lower life-expectancy, more days sick per year, and other measurable outcomes.<p>By your definition, country B has the better health care system but I think most people would prefer the overall health of country A. Therefore your measurement is not so useful as an indicator of overall health outcomes.",1298451211

2253534,comment,2253412,2253412,0,0,MortenK,,,"I believe the ""new mouse"" is not gesture-based control like the Kinect, but rather eye tracking such as tobii.com. Gesture-based control is great for certain things like controlling a TV or similar, but simple fatigue will be the problem in using it for more ""typical"" computing scenarios. Just try and stretch your arms in front of you for two minutes, you'll see what I mean. Eye-tracking on the other hand, can very well be used for standard computer use, and it's an amazing (dare I say magical) way of interacting with a computer. This is given the right software naturally, as a standard eye-tracked mouse cursor is not really that great. In any case, the next 5-10 years will be interesting in terms of UI and peripheral development.",1298451059

2253515,comment,2253344,2253455,0,0,mattetti,,,"@cscotta as the author of the blog post, I can only agree with the concerns you raised and thank you for your kind words.<p>Concurrency is something both Ruby and Python have to take seriously pretty quickly if both communities want to mature and play a more important role in the coming years. As you pointed out, there are different ways to get some sort of concurrency and they all present challenges and tradeoffs while none will cure all ills. But at the end of the day what matters is a community of people embracing these approaches and pushing the language further.<p>By removing the Global Interpreter Lock most of the alternative Ruby implementations are making a statement and the community seems to react. If we educate the community, commonly used code will become threadsafe over time and developers will learn what it means to write threadsafe code. If made easy, co-routines and non-blocking IO will be used. If implemented well and properly explained, actors will be used more often when it makes sense to do so.<p>My goal was to try to simplify the concurrency problem so the community as a whole can discuss the topic. I think that the concurrency challenge can be improved by increasing the awareness, getting people motivated and having an open discussion. There is a reason why Ruby and Python still have a GIL and why removing it to improve concurrency would have its downside. I want to make sure people understand that before blaming Matz for not removing the GIL already. The Ruby implementation fragmentation also hurts progress done in MRI, if you look at it, alternative implementations often have more people working on them than people working on MRI!<p>Let's hope that this article is indeed a step in the right direction.",1298450075

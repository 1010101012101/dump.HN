Someone, somewhere, will run into an ugly corner case. Or some app that has been quietly chugging along in the corner suddenly causes serious breakage.<p>That's the moment when you get all those bugs closed with WORKSFORME, INVALID or other non-solutions, because users can't get the debugging info on their production system, and the enthusiastic developers can't reproduce it on their system and are not as enthusiastic about figuring out which obscure corner case caused the sytem to misbehave.<p>As an example, see here:\n<a href=""https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ureadahead/+bug/484677"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ureadahead/+bug/48...</a>\nUnder various conditions, the boot process just gets stuck (e.g., when something has juggled the hard drive letters and what used to be /dev/sda is now /dev/sdb and vice versa, or you have a routine fdisk check, or something else), and when you switch off the splash screen (or don't have it switched on at all, for obvious reasons), all you see is the (spurious) message from ureadahead-other. Net result: this kind of spurious hangs on boot, which were reasonably easy to diagnose in the time of SysVinit, are now a serious PITA and the developers which are responsible for the boot process don't give a fart because people don't have the knowledge that's needed to debug the subtle interplay of dbus, upstart, plymouth (it's obvious that ""plymouth"" is the splash screen software and not a device driver for a CRT-based face tanning, isn't it?), and possibly others.\n(Full disclosure: I twice or thrice spent a whole morning figuring out a random boot problem without getting anywhere.  After several hours, I found out that part of the problem was caused by mountall not finding something, then asking whether you want to continue booting without actually displaying a prompt that says so. Back then, I managed to find the corresponding bug on launchpad among the 5+ bugs about weird, hard-to-diagnose boot problems where all you see is the ureadahead-other message).<p>TL/DR: if you consider moving X into the kernel, please imagine yourself in a situation where X breaks in production and you have to guide a user through the debugging of X and various assorted components that talk to X in order to find out whether it's X or Y or ABC and what exactly is breaking.

There is already a process by which developers have to get their wares certified to run on the Xbox so the review process is pretty much already in place. The barrier to entry on the 360 needs to be significantly lowered (there have been half-baked efforts, but nothing terribly inspiring). One of the most exciting rumors (that didn't happen) about the Apple TV was that it would be running iOS and allow for apps on a television. The Xbox 360 is in a great position to make this a reality. Let me write tiny games/apps for the 360, and let it be easier to get them on Live than it is to get on Apple's App Store.<p>2. The way the entire company thinks about User Interface / User Experience design is, if I may be impolite, <i>fucked</i>. What little I've been able to read regarding how MS goes about designing the parts of their software that people see and use comes down to this; We follow whatever Office does and middle management sanitizes everything. It's no wonder that something great like Courier died inside of Microsoft. Designing applications for <i>humans</i> is very, very hard. Designing applications for humans inside of a huge bureaucracy is next to impossible. There are probably people working at MS with titles like ""User Advocate"" and other nonsense, but the end product reflects that those people are incompetent, impotent, or both. A team of powerful, capable people need the ability to ""stop the line"" and say no to the bullshit. The company has coasted for far too long on UI/UX familiarity due to the pervasiveness of its products. People <i>hate</i> using MS software. My family <i>hate</i> their Windows PCs. The gloss and fresh paint of Vista/7 haven't addressed the common person's frustration. In a business environment people have an incentive to adapt to bad software and work around it. At home my mother just wants her computer to print a photo at the click of a button, at the proper resolution, with the right orientation, and exactly how she sees it on the screen. Experienced business and technical users have mentally blocked out the usability cruft of the last 20 years, but the consumer market is and will continue to be unforgiving.

In industry, you learn very quickly that everything you learned in college is minuscule compared to what you actually need to know to work.<p>I knew guys who only studied databases or only studied HTML+JavaScript+CSS. And we all expected that this level of specialization was common and even desirable! Wow. Looking back now, how silly of us. Where did we get this idea? Certainly not from anyone with significant experience in industry. We had one professor with significant industry experience... from the days of IBM mainframes. She was the head of the department. She ran two classes a year, in ""software engineering"", basically ""technical writing and project management"". They were good classes, the most like the ""real world"" of any of our courses, but only 50% of the students took it and it represented maybe 10% of our studies for those of us who did.<p>Yes, the CS degree is about preparing students for CS graduate programs. But there was never a suggestion that perhaps the CS degree was not what we needed. Or maybe there was a suggestion, one, from some guy on Teh Intarwebs, against every other person in positions of respect around us. We were consistently told that the CS degree was the path to a software development degree. Yes, internships. They are very important. We don't do enough of them. We certainly need more of an apprenticeship model. I suspect that the development of good programmers would work in a culinary school model more than a research school model.<p>College graduates are basically the first level of competency worth training to become developers, or at least are supposed to be (let's just stick to ideal situations right now, with no wind resistance and infinite point masses). It's like in the martial arts, we say that black-belt is where the learning <i>begins</i>. Once you reach black-belt/BSCS, you have only acquired the <i>tools</i> that you need to start learning.<p>Every programmer I've known thought he was a super hacker by the time he got out of college. Me included. I see it in the interviews I conduct, also. There is an air of arrogance. There is a sense of shock and personal assault when pointing out their errors. They haven't yet grocked that the code is not them. They haven't yet learned that the errors are inevitable, that it is only time and experience that teaches us how to avoid them, that programming is about the pursuit of eventual perfection and not the dogmatic defense of yesterday's code.<p>So one of two things happens. Either the degreed programmer shucks his hubris and finds humility, or he becomes a leech on his coworkers (and my use of the masculine pronoun is no mistake, the female programmers I've known don't have this pathology). Unfortunately, the latter is apparently indistinguishable from the former for most management types. Haha, but digging on the liberal arts majors aside, most people who come out of college with a BS in CS do not want to make programming their wake-to-sleep life. They want it to be their 9-to-5 career, and leeching is the easier route to that.<p>The kids mean well, I'm sure they are quite intelligent, and they've got heart. But a startup was probably the worst first endeavor for them. I think it's better to go through your male-programmer-humiliation on someone else's dollar. They're basically going into more debt to learn how to be programmers now that they've gotten out of college. They could have been earning a salary to learn how to be programmers.",1284746527

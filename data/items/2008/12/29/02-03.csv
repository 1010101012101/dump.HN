Most programmers know that Alan Kay is the author of the original quote and a simple Google search would verify that. Just because a site or two quote David Heinemeier Hansson on a variation of said quote, it doesn't mean that he claimed it was his quote.

While the topic may be provocative, I felt it was relevant, based on my observations of YC. However, because I can only provide anecdote as evidence of my case, I asked the question to discover whether my observations about YC are shared or whether I am suffering from a delusion. Textually this may seem like trollish behavior but some of the responses to the question seem to belie this suggestion.<p>As for your point about Google, some ideas are so powerful that they fall outside the conventional expectations of business practice. The fact that Google's founders have, until lately anyway, been unassertive in the manner of Microsoft, does not indicate that Bill Gates' approach ""is not worth much"". Absent some ground-shaking idea like Google's, I would argue the assertive approach of Microsoft is the norm for a successful company and a key ingredient missing in the YC environment.",1230518408

As a developer with a degree and over 15 years of varied and international experience, I'd rather be regarded as a professional than just another office worker. Most of my friends are in professions where their experience is both respected and rewarded with steadily improving pay and conditions. Taking just 3 examples - how many skilled civil engineers, optometrists and hydrogeologists have to deal with new graduates or having their work outsourced to India?<p>The low barriers to entry in IT are both a blessing and a curse. It's great in your 20s, but by your 30s the gap with most other technical <i>professions</i> that require similar levels of intelligence and skill becomes obvious. That decade of experience doesn't count for as much as a lot of it is now outdated and irrelevant.

We're working on the solution to all of this at Famigo - http://www.famigo.com<p>At Famigo, we've built a system to help find and recommend great apps for families.  We approach this problem in a lot of different ways: our staff reviews every app on the site, our rankings are crowd-sourced based on what parents actually find helpful, and then we throw some machine learning in there based on app trends over time.

The painful experience of China after defeat in the Opium Wars means that several countries of Asia view promotion of drug use among their populace as an instrument of foreign colonialist oppression. The zero-tolerance policies (including the death penalty for possession of quite small amounts of prohibited drugs) in those countries flow directly from a historical experience in which a drugged population became easier rather than harder to oppress.

[..] Bravo!<p>I like the sentiment and agree with most of it. But we are definitely not in a good place quite yet.<p>It looks like Chrome will overtake Firefox this year on desktop. It will likely also overtake IE on desktop, simply because the number of people forced to use IE - in big corporations - is small compared to the number of normal users. So IE will continue to go down quite a lot more.<p>So Chrome will be the #1 browser on desktop. But that's just one side of things. Chrome will also be the #1 mobile browser because it will be bundled on Android, the #1 mobile OS. Combine desktop and mobile, and Chrome will get a dominating majority. (ChromeBooks might also take off, making the control even more complete - but it's hard to say if they will.)<p>Chrome's rise is the result of a great product and a truly massive marketing campaign. But it looks like it will succeed far too much, potentially replacing the currently open and competitive space with one dominated once again by a single player. And just like the previous dominator, this one has other products it can and will leverage with the browser (as we saw indications of in the leaked Dart memo, and as we currently see with Chrome-only features of gmail and google docs).<p>Yes, Chrome is mostly open source, so that by itself makes it less evil than the previous browser monopoly. But even an open source project that is controlled by one company, and used to further its own ends - which legally it must as a for-profit - can be a very bad thing.

You could write a dummy function:<p><pre><code>  def extract_2(dct):\n    return dct[2]\n  x.sort(key=extract_2)\n</code></pre>\nOr, you could just use a quick lambda:<p><pre><code>  x.sort(key=lambda dct: dct[2])\n</code></pre>\nThe latter is more terse, and to a functional programmer, more clear (YMMV, of course).  Lambda is just syntactic sugar in python; it's not necessary, and a lot of places where a functional programmer uses it in python make more sense as list comprehensions, but I think it's a nice thing to have.<p>EDIT:<p>I think the biggest reason I prefer the lambda approach to the named-function approach is that I don't like seeing one-off functions defined first and then seeing them used later.

I feel just like another cog in the machine and plan to quit my job at one of the big companies listed above next week.<p>Now I am trying to figure out what to do next. I've realized that the problem is not computer science - I find it extremely beautiful to see good engineering being applied, and love to learn new things and see how my experience over the years can be applied and valuable to the business. But I need an environment that nurtures creativity, where excellence is actually valued and engineers can exercise their creativity, being autonomous. I want to deliver a solution, and be able to decide how to tackle it, not being micromanaged and having my creativity killed as the manager thinks that another solution is more in line with his experience and taste.<p>Is there life after working for big companies?

Maybe the author does this work, maybe more likely distribution maintainers do it.<p>Or in the world of a specific programming language, there is a similar story with a language specific packaging system. Maybe it gets packaged as a gem, or a jar, or an egg, or a module, or maybe the new node package manager.<p>Often, installing a package involves spreading its contents around. Some of it goes in /var, some goes in /opt, some goes in /etc. Who knows where else?<p>Many of the reasons for the unix directory layout don't apply for most people today. How many people even know what those directories' purposes are? How many have actually read the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard document?<p>Typically, those directories were established so that sysadmins could save storage space by sharing files between sets of machines (the word ""share"" seems to have about a dozen different meanings in these discussions). So you slice it one way so that machines with different architectures can ""share"" the contents of /usr/share, and you slice it another way so that things that change can be backed up more often, so they get thrown together in /var (and then you can mount /usr read-only!)<p>Most of these considerations are not worth the effort for most people. I think they are outdated. We don't generally have these directories mounted on separate partitions. We just back up the whole damn hard drive when we need a backup.<p>Here's an idea: a package should be a directory tree that stays together. Each programming language should not have its own separate packaging system. A package should be known by the url where the author publishes it. That author should also declare his/her package's dependencies by referring to other packages by their urls. Then you don't need dependency resolution systems that function as islands unto themselves (one for debian, another for node etc).<p>Software is published on the web, in things like git or mercurial or subversion repositories. These have conventions for tagging each version. The conventions are gaining adoption (see semver.org for example) but not fast enough.<p>Some middle layers just add friction to the process: distributing tarfiles, distributing packages to places like rubygems or cpan or npmjs.org. Developers usually want the source straight from the source anyway -- users might as well use a setup that very closely mirrors developers'.<p>If you want to add a package into your system, the only piece of information you should need is the url for the project's main repository, with an identifier for the exact release you need. That's a naming system shared by the entire web. If there are issues, that information can go from the user directly to the author, with no layers in between.<p>Apple has a great install/uninstall process for many applications: you move them to the applications folder, or you drag them out of the applications folder into the trash. We need to strive for this level of simplicity. Deployed software should have the same structure as the package distributed by the developer, in almost all cases.",1317399977

3057473,comment,3057159,3057366,8,0,jbail,,,"HTML5 <i>is</i> JavaScript. Without JavaScript, HTML5 is just a few semantic HTML tags (like header and section) and a few extra form input attributes (like required and placeholder).<p>As far as JavaScript frameworks go, you could use Sencha or jQuery Mobile or one of the other few dozen frameworks out there --- or you could roll your own.<p>I've been doing mobile web development for about a year now. I've done both PhoneGap and over-the-air mobile web/native apps (with embedded webviews that load HTML/CSS/JS from the web when requested). Both types of apps accepted by Apple and in the Appstore as well as in the Android Market. I would recommend rolling your own and not trying to imitate the look of native apps. One of the strengths of using HTML5 is that you can create a custom look and feel that doesn't look like every other app out there.<p>Since you mentioned Sencha and jQuery Mobile, here's what I think having used both:<p>Using Sencha is nothing at all like using HTML5. You don't even write HTML or CSS. You write JavaScript that uses Sencha's classes/methods. The look and feel very much tries to mimic native and they do a pretty good job at it...except that most widgets look like they were ripped from an iPhone, which is disorienting for users on Android. That said, you get good performance and a boatload of widgets/ui controls out of the box. The price for this is a large, multi-hundred kb framework and a commercial license.<p>jQuery Mobile doesn't really try to look native and it really doesn't ""feel"" native either. jQuery has it's own ui controls that more or less look identical on iPhone or Android. With jQuery Mobile, you do write HTML and have a more transparent view of that as well as of the CSS. But, you have to write HTML the ""jQuery Mobile way"" to utilize the UI built into the framework. You don't get as many widgets and ui-controls as you do in Sencha and overall, the look and feel is not of the same caliber either. But, it's smaller than Sencha, has your standard MIT license and is more easily modified.<p>Neither is perfect and both have pluses and minuses. If you know some HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you will absolutely get better performance and and a smoother look and feel by rolling your own light JavaScript for your app that does just what it needs to do.<p>If you'd like to see an example app I built using PhoneGap and handrolled HTML/JavaScript/CSS, you can download Easy Baby from the Android Market. It's free. You'll find a link to it on my website: <a href=""http://newbabysleep.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newbabysleep.com</a>",1317398522

Consider internal apps, for example, that don't have to be massively visually slick and polished.<p>But ... given the very large differences between even similar platforms, and even between versions of platforms, you're not going to be getting much from this if you are building ultra-slick apps in which you really do need consider, say, how hardware acceleration or browser quirks fit into the picture.",1317398510

Some people (particularly the ones who think that <i>copy</i> and <i>paste</i> were invented by God on the eighth day of creation) get it into their heads that they should redesign the emacs interface on their first day. This is particularly tempting because the ability to remap keys all over the place is one of emacs' best features.<p>Resist the temptation to do this at first. The emacs ecosystem actually makes a great deal of sense once you settle into its way of thinking. It's sometimes hard to believe, but very smart programmers have spent decades working out where to put things in emacs. If you insist on ignoring their efforts, and instead try to pretend that emacs is a lot like the Mac OS, you will never even learn the basics, like the glories of the kill ring and the mark ring, or the important distinctions between a file and a buffer.",1222221091

I can't really afford match.com because I'm trying to put money away for tuition, as I mentioned. I could afford it, I'm just trying to get back into school ASAP.\nI don't like bars, I don't like getting drunk, and I don't like the kind of women that troll bars, so that venue is out.

But I'll offer you some coaching anyway. Imagine Vince Lombardi reading this to you:<p>Stop using the mouse. If you're using emacs and you're touching the mouse, you're doing it wrong.<p>Stop fretting about the GUI. Why does your editor need a GUI? Emacs is a <i>text editor</i>, a program that is all about <i>text</i>. It's <i>text</i> all the way down. If it had more chrome, that would be wasting pixels that <i>could be devoted to text</i>. (Seriously: As Yegge will tell you, the true emacs user turns <i>off</i> the pull-down menus to make more room for text.)<p>Stop worrying about ""intuitive"". Yes, until you get to know the moves, emacs is nonintuitive, kind of like the piano. No matter how expensive and well-designed a piano I buy, I won't be able to just sit down and play some Chopin. (Well, technically you can buy player pianos that will do just that, but what would a concert pianist call such an instrument? <i>A toy</i>.) You're learning an open-source text editor that's quite possibly older than you. You will live with this software for months, years, or decades. You don't need features that make it easy to learn emacs in five minutes. You need the features that make it worthwhile to use emacs after thirty years.<p>And, yes, you haven't spent enough time. In particular, it's not just a matter of plugging away in emacs for weeks or months; it's unlike any other software you've ever used, and until you're oriented you won't find it easy to pick up things just by playing with it. You have to study it a little. Try some of the references. Try the Emacs Wiki.",1222219342

Namely keeping clients running an old version of the client-side code using the corresponding version of the server-side app. When you add in something like Gears for offline access it gets even tougher. There was a good presentation at Google IO that covered all these issues: <a href=""http://sites.google.com/site/io/taking-large-scale-applications-offline---lessons-learned-from-google-docs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sites.google.com/site/io/taking-large-scale-applicati...</a><p>We wrote a little custom code (we call it ""bake"") for deploying Cappuccino applications:<p>""bake"": <a href=""http://github.com/280north/cappuccino/tree/master/Tools/bake/bake.j"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/280north/cappuccino/tree/master/Tools/bake...</a><p>sample ""bakefile"": <a href=""http://github.com/280north/cappuccino/tree/master/Tools/bake/example.bakefile"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/280north/cappuccino/tree/master/Tools/bake...</a><p>It pulls your code from git (but could easily do local files, scp, rsync, svn, etc), runs an optional build  command (like ""ant""), copies source paths to destination paths in a deployment directory, gzips the deployment directory, scp's the code to your server(s), ungzips it, and does a little magic...<p>Each version is placed in it's entirety in a uniquely named (unix timestamp) subdirectory. We could just redirect from ""/"" to ""/1221268756/"" (for example) but that's incredibly ugly, so we use the little known HTML <base> tag to trick it. The index.html file in ""/"" is identical to the one in ""/1221268756/"" except it has a <base> tag which tells the app all URLs are relative to ""/1221268756/"" instead of the default containing directory (""/"").<p>And it actually seems to work really well. The big advantage of this is you can set your cache expire date arbitrarily far in the future, and your entire app will be cached until you change index.html to point to a new <base>. 280 Slides, which is ~2.6MB uncompressed, loads on my computer in about 1.5 seconds if it's cached. The only problem with this approach is when you deploy, all clients will have to re-download every resource, even ones that don't change.

Conservatism is a rather rational, effective strategy for systems that require high reliability.<p>Also, adding more production sites is less of a risk than changing the transmission system. If a newfangled power plant doesn't work, there are other sources of power to draw from. Worst-case scenario is a power shortage. If you fuck with the transmission system, you risk creating new types of faults, in addition to needing to replace or recalibrate your substation equipment along the line. And if the transmission system goes down for an appreciable period of time, you get unplanned, uncontrolled, uncontrollable blackouts. And then the CEO has to try to explain why exactly he crashed the power grid by installing some type of hippie-shit wind turbines to the transmission lines.<p>I'm not saying it's a bad idea or that it can't be done.

681730,comment,681458,681458,0,0,fuzzmeister,,,"This essay appears to be pointing out a problem with many, if not the majority, of philosophies and ideologies: oversimplification.<p>Objectivism states that if all humans were to pursue their own self-actualization at all times, the world would automatically become a better place. Socialism states that if every man contributed his best and received what he needed, again, the world would become a better place. Neither is possible in the real world.<p>Economic hardship, social need, and lack of opportunity prevent many in the world from coming close to achieving objectivist self-actualization, and the greed and selfishness fundamental to human nature preclude many people from working for the benefit of others. Further, other elements of human nature, such as altruism and empathy, mean that there will always be many people working for the benefit of others rather than themselves. But, social and economic status often prevent these people from doing so, and require that they work for themselves, even if not achieving self-actualization in the process.<p>Essentially, the reality is that these philosophies are interesting to think about, but should not be used to govern the real world. The real world will always need a mix of capitalism and socialism, selfishness and altruism, love for oneself and love for others.

Do you view all of those people as noble souls who would quite rather be working on a trading floor somewhere but are gritting their teeth in self-suppression as they provide social services to others?<p>Rand would argue that if someone derives meaning from solving a world problem such as homelessness, that his/her selfish <i>(self-actualized)</i> pursuit of that goal is the highest thing he/she can do.<p>note:  Rand's essay is not at all about taxation.

""Knowledge"" in this case is what you have learned and retained through high school.  I am being gracious by throwing test-taking ability in there, because I'm not entirely convinced there really is such a thing.  I only took the ACT once, as a senior, and scored a 32 (out of 36), so I certainly hadn't specifically prepared for the type of test.  I just took the test, and the questions I knew the answers to, I got right, the others I got wrong.  But since almost everyone else seems to agree that being bad at test-taking can make you ""choke"" and score lower than what you should, I will concede that your ACT test score represents the lower of those two attributes.",1246399254

I love tech but I have an a4 sized sketchpad and a good pencil I take everywhere with me. I use it for everything from meeting notes to drawings/ideas. I&#x27;ll use it to demonstrate ideas/concepts to a client or just to hlep me work out something (I&#x27;m very visual)<p>I can&#x27;t see myself ever parting with it. I love the feel - there&#x27;s something about using real pencil and paper digital can never replace, and I have a draw full of old notbooks I can look back through which is kind of nice.<p>As far as search/organisation etc well... a notepad&#x27;s not so good for that but my drawings tend to be write-only.

6448451,comment,6448194,6448194,1,0,PhasmaFelis,,,"&quot;Then comes the hardware, you know the part Intel does. It sucks too. Why? Because for the last 5 or so generations it doesnt actually do anything noticeably better for the user. Sure the CPU performance goes up 10% or so every generation, battery life gets better at a slightly faster pace, and graphics improving extra-linearly but that is irrelevant if you arent benchmarking.&quot;<p>In a sane world, this would be a feature, not a bug. PCs are now mature enough that you can buy a decent machine and expect that it will not be hopelessly outdated in two years. This is a good thing.<p>The problem is that hardware and software manufacturers have a mutually beneficial relationship whereby new software just won&#x27;t function without that extra 10% hardware capacity you get from a new computer. Even if it&#x27;s a word processor or a not-terribly-impressive game. (Remember &quot;DirectX 10 requires the power of Vista&quot;, which requires a much faster computer that XP?)<p>And the other problem is that doofuses like the article writer have been so thoroughly gulled by the planned-obsolence treadmill that they actually think that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s <i>supposed to be</i>, and throw tantrums if this year&#x27;s hardware isn&#x27;t at least 10 times shinier and more sparkly than last year&#x27;s.",1380160404

6448440,comment,6446328,6447361,1,0,pdonis,,,"<i>Your statement (1) depends on the existence of multiple electrons</i><p>No, it doesn&#x27;t. The single electron could still be acted on by various operators in the course of its twisty path through spacetime, which could make it appear in various different ways. Which operators might be acting is then deduced from the different ways electrons appear.<p>Your hypothesis amounts to the claim that the only operator that is required to act on the single electron, to explain all its different appearances, is the spin reversal operator. My point is that that hypothesis only accounts for the appearance of &quot;electrons&quot; (more precisely, different views of the single electron) with opposite spins and the same charge; it does <i>not</i> account for the appearance of &quot;electrons&quot; (different views of the single electron) with opposite charges, because no unitary operator can change the charge, and the spin reversal operator is unitary.<p><i>If this operator actually existed in reality such that a single electron&#x27;s spin can be flipped by applying it to an actual physical electron?</i><p>Sure it does; there are many different kinds of experimental setups that can realize this operator. One of the simplest is an inhomogeneous magnetic field. The &quot;operator&quot; language is just a way of linking the math describing electrons with the physical setup that does things to them.<p><i>If this operator does exist, then one could not say that there was a single electron on a path, unless all electrons in the universe changed spin direction instantly after the application such an operator.</i><p>No, this is not correct. The operator can be localized, so it only operates on one &quot;electron&quot; (i.e., one particular segment on the single electron&#x27;s entire worldline) at a time.<p>In fact, regardless of which operator acts on the electron, it <i>has</i> to be localized for the hypothesis that there is only one electron to make sense. The whole point of the hypothesis is that the single electron follows a highly twisted path through spacetime, so that it crosses any single spacelike slice of spacetime multiple times, with each crossing potentially having a different appearance (different spin, etc.). That means whatever operator acts on the electron to make its path through spacetime twist <i>has</i> to be localized--otherwise all the appearances of electrons everywhere in the universe at a given instant of time would be exactly the same, which they obviously aren&#x27;t.",1380160223

All it takes is one to issue a malicious cert, or to get hacked, to do a MITM attack on ANY domain without showing a browser warning.<p>The trustworthyness of a single CA doesn&#x27;t make a difference, because if any CA isn&#x27;t trustworthy then an attacker can use them instead the other ones.

I&#x27;ve had to send them photos of my passport and talk to them on the phone to do identity verification.

6448392,comment,6445657,6445657,4,0,e12e,,,"Thanks for summing up, concisely, why webhooks really aren&#x27;t magic at all, in the fourth paragraph:<p>&quot;All [webhooks] are is a promise by an application or API: when this thing happens, Ill send this HTTP request with this data.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s nice to see that all the hype really just boils down to generalized pingbacks[1]. Now, having a standard is great -- I&#x27;m not entirely sure we <i>have</i> a standard yet, though. It&#x27;s more like a fancy name for pingbacks that aren&#x27;t just for blog posts.<p>I&#x27;m also not entirely sure if I&#x27;d prefer webhooks for eg. processing emails. Emails are naturally &quot;push&quot; -- they get pushed via SMTP. I know that people are scared of email/SMTP -- but it seems quite a lot easier to make sure you don&#x27;t loose any &quot;events&quot; with SMTP than with HTTP(S).<p>What if your site is down for a few minutes, just as some service out there tries to &quot;ping&quot; you with a webhook? Email handles that.<p>I think what most people seem to mix up is that handling &quot;real&quot; email may be hard -- but looking for a well formed subject that exactly matches some regex, then parsing that, isn&#x27;t that hard. Everything else you can either bounce (a little dangerous) or just drop (not quite as dangerous).<p>Mailing-lists work. What you need isn&#x27;t much more complicated. Maybe allow for a mime-part with a json or xml, or some other well-formed body. Use gpg or smime to encrypt data, if you need something more than a short hash/token.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingback"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingback</a>",1380159040

6448386,comment,6447783,6448221,3,0,breckinloggins,,,"I have a prediction about where this will go:<p>First, things will continue about the way they are now: cores will stay at the same speed or get slower but there will be more of them.<p>The industry will stay this way for at least the next 5 to 10 years, and during that time we are going to get better and better figuring out how to take advantage of the increasing number of cores.<p>Finally, at some point in the future (I predict between 10 and 15 years), we are going to see an <i>explosion</i> in materials science that allows us to suddenly jump from 3 - 5GHz / core to 400 GHz - 5 THz per core (with even more cores than we have now and dramatically lower power consumption).<p>At this point we will be nicely prepared to exploit <i>both</i> the parallelism and the return of raw speed gains. We&#x27;ll also see completely different architectures like Chuck Moore&#x27;s greenArrays, quantum co-processors, &quot;memory/compute fabrics&quot; like memristor crossbar arrays, and further advancements in the GPU/APU area. These changes will continue to challenge our assumptions about what are the &quot;proper&quot; paradigms, languages, and architectures for computer programs.<p>We&#x27;ve made great progress already. I can think of myself as an example: in 2005 I, like most of the programmers here, read Herb Sutter&#x27;s essay <i>The Free Lunch Is Over</i>[1] and realized that he was correct: the era of easy speedups was giving way to the era of concurrency. And programmers were going to have to figure out how to take advantage of that concurrency or an app in 2013 was going to run at about the same speed as an app in 2005.<p>But I had <i>no idea</i> how we were going to do that. I&#x27;d used threads and mutexes and locks in my professional work so I knew that correct concurrency was hard (and correctness almost never survived past a few rounds of maintenance). But I didn&#x27;t have the first clue how we were going to get out of this mess without all becoming experts in Category Theory.<p>Fast forward to today and I find myself using things like &quot;lambda expressions&quot;, &quot;functional closures&quot;, &quot;higher order functions&quot;, &quot;map/reduce&quot;, &quot;filters&quot;, and even &quot;monads&quot; and, you know what, they now seem as natural to me as the for-loop.<p>These days, I&#x27;m much more likely to write:<p><pre><code>    stuff.select {|l| l > 23}.map(&:increment_magically).sum
</code></pre>
than I am to write the equivalent imperative loop. I&#x27;m no genius, so I consider it remarkable that I&#x27;ve been able to digest these concepts as fast as I did.<p>And I am willing to bet that many other programmers here feel the same way. Not only that, but we are beginning to <i>really understand</i> things like:<p>- Identity vs value<p>- The benefits and dangers of mutable state<p>- Impure vs pure functions<p>- Software Transactional Memory<p>- MVCC / persistent data structures<p>- Even Category Theory :)<p>None of this stuff was even remotely on my radar 8 years ago, and now it&#x27;s part of our professional lives. We may not get to <i>use</i> it all yet, but we can use more and more of it on every project.<p>And we are seeing the benefits.<p>Now fast forward to a time when we not only have hundreds or thousands of cores, but they suddenly jump up to 500 GHz. I guarantee you none of these skills will have been for nought.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm</a>",1380158898

I went pretty far down this rabbit hole a few years ago before pulling back a bit recently.  It&#x27;s a very appealing concept, but in production you often run into corner cases where your basic display classes cause unwanted cascading (especially when wielded by users without a deep knowledge of CSS), requiring you to write a bunch of reset utilities with !important attributes.  It&#x27;s also ungodly messy, as a lot of people point out, and refactoring can be a nightmare when you have to grep for class names like &quot;right&quot; and &quot;text&quot; over dozens or hundreds of templates.<p>I&#x27;ve since settled into a pattern of using generalized module definitions (list-module, list-module--header, list-module--separator, etc), which is verbose but creates highly portable and maintainable classes.  The few presentational classes that I do still use regularly are for white space (padding, margin, defined in short class names like .ptm for padding top medium, a convention borrowed from Nicole Sullivan&#x27;s OOCSS libraries), and a contextual color palette (.box-warning, .text-danger, etc).  The best of both worlds approach is to use a large library of presentational classes as sass placeholders (%color-scheme-inverse, %clearfix, etc) and @extend them where required.  This does generate slightly larger CSS files but if you are properly modularizing your style definitions it shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.  The stuff that semanticUI is doing looks great and is a step in the right direction, but way-too-generic class names and lack of namespacing are a constant source of bugs (along the lines of putting all of your variables into a single global scope and using names like &#x27;first&#x27; and &#x27;finished&#x27;).<p>EDIT: for clarity.",1380157357

This means you&#x27;ll be serving a certificate for your default site &#x27;foo.com&#x27; when you requested &#x27;bar.org&#x27;, providing the user with a domain mismatch security warning.<p>The second non-solution would be to configure every domain with self-signed certificates, but then you&#x27;d still be sending your clients an untrusted certificate. The only way to truly provide SSL on a shared host is to configure it with a UCC certificate that includes every domain you are pointing at it, or generate cheap/free certificates like StartSSL&#x27;s for every unique domain and subdomain you listen for.",1380157289

Everyone values genius, welcome to the crowd. It is a convenient excuse to obsess on others' talent as if genes and childhood were all that separated you from them. You appear to be focusing too much on outcome rather than on the hard work necessary to achieve it. Skills always look natural from the outside! But ask the honest, reflective people you admire and they'll tell you: they worked their butts off on fundamentals. <i>Psst: fundamentals are open to you too.</i><p>Don't obsess over shortcuts.

Business rules change because the nature of business changes. Over-engineering databases to account for future changes takes a lot of time and effort. If the company does not sell outside of US and does not have plans to sell outside of US anytime soon, I would not spend a week implementing Norwegian, UAE, and Indian addressing and tax/tariff system.<p>When I designed the payroll system for my company, I took into account that hourly employees can get promoted and become salaried. This happens once a quarter or two and the system can deal with it. Now if a salaried employee wants to become an hourly employee, my system cannot auto-calculate the change in their vacation days etc. It would require a considerable amount of time for me to build that functionality in. However, it is possible for this situation to happen but in five years, it has only happened once. In that instance, I manually edited the records and documented the entries. So does that mean I designed the database schema poorly? No it just means I did not want to make it so rich and extensive that it can handle every remote case, just most of them.",1232121396

I'm a professional screencaster (<a href=""http://procasts.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://procasts.co.uk</a>) - if you want to crib examples, see my Examples page, they all reflect live use of screencasts that make users happier, convert more visitors, reduce support costs etc.  
Definitely get a good mic - I prefer pro audio equipment but you'll go a long way with a decent USB mic (not 3.5mm jacks, they get electrical noise from the motherboard).  
If you can't do good audio yourself then see something like voices.com for outsourcing but melding the video+audio can be problematic.  You <i>do</i> need good audio, as others have said the easiest way to kill your presentation is muffled, noisy, volume-changing hard-to-understand audio.
Expect 1 day to do a first reasonable video of a few minutes, several days if you want a perfect cut with great audio, a bit more if you want to add effects (captions, fades, highlights, scrolls).
Look at ShowMeDo for 800+ examples of screencasts made by many users on different OSs with different tools.

Wasn't exactly what we wanted, so we used Screenflow, which is $99 and Mac only as has been mentioned. It's very easy to use and the editing options are great.<p>Once you have the video, there's obviously still the decision of how to get it onto your site. After trying a couple different methods, I settled on YouTube. My primary objection to this originally was the video quality, however there is a way to force embedded video to play in either ""High Quality"" which I found acceptable, or in HD, which is great (and what we ended up using). To do this, you append ""&ap=%2526fmt%3D22"" for HD or ""&ap=%2526fmt%3D18"" for high quality onto the back of both links in the YouTube embed code. (more here: <a href=""http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/11/20/how-to-embed-and-play-720p-hd-high-definition-youtube-videos-fmt22-code-hack/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/11/20/how-to-embed-and-pl...</a>).<p>Lastly, we used lightwindow to diplay the video (<a href=""http://www.stickmanlabs.com/lightwindow/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stickmanlabs.com/lightwindow/</a>).

436740,comment,436663,436663,0,0,chime,,,"Let me add a few more from my 16+ years of DB coding:<p>1. Many field types will change over time. Booleans will become multiple choice. Character fields will become memos/text. Date fields will start to have year, month, or day parts optional.<p>2. All tables with tax-logic will be compounded by code hacks. So just a table with county tax rates and order amount ranges will not be sufficient to calculate the applicable tax because you will need to keep adding special conditions of tax to apply when pencils are sold on 3rd week of every month when school is in session.<p>3. Management will never understand how it could be that complex to ""just change the database"" to enable payroll calculation for hourly employees who work overtime just because the database already handles the fixed payroll for salaried employees. In other words, databases with existing data, logic, triggers, and reports will always be difficult to change.<p>4. The biggest rule is that business logic never ever translates to structured database tables without lots of conditions in code and strict limitations in scope of application. I'm not talking about pretty to-do lists, address books, or blog engines. I'm talking custom ERP apps, MRP modules, production forecast algos and my favorite, scheduling for production and employees.<p>I guess the take-home message in all of this is that don't get into this field if you don't like challenges of this sort. In addition to coding up DB apps, I also make a lot of non-database apps that keep me sane and balance things out. However, in terms of sheer complexity and project planning, good DB apps are pretty high on my list of ""exciting"" things.",1232120633
436739,comment,435387,435387,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"This is a good, involved, and deep article on robotics in warfare. Some of the memes, like ""cost to go to war"" are quite frankly old chestnuts -- true for hundreds of years and just repeated here. (I'm reminded of one' historian's view of the American Civil War -- the north would have won anyway because, compared to other civil wars, the north really was never completely committed)<p>I began reading the article due to the cute title iamelgringo gave it -- here's a plug for re-editing titles for the HN audience.<p>What concerns me is what wasn't mentioned: the goal of warfare is to make the other side stop fighting. We will certainly develop and create expensive drones and such for the elimination of enemy combatants. As the  Air Force lieutenant general forecasts in the article, that ""given the growth trends, it is not unreasonable to postulate future conflicts involving tens of thousands [of drones]""<p>But that's assuming we fight wars the way we want to fight them, instead of the wars we end up with. In the article, the example is given of a little ground bot made for recon. Soldiers quickly learned that you could strap a claymore on the front of the bot and use it as sort of an intelligent roaming land mine. Cost of such a new kind of bot? About $5K.<p>To make the other side stop fighting, you don't necessarily have to engage his military or command centers. I can see non-state actors evolving cheap bots to attack civilians and instill fear. Instead of a smart bomb, I guess you'd call it a smart terrorist bomb -- perhaps hundreds of RC airplanes with intelligent chips and biological weapons as payloads, or RC cars loaded with C-4 that wait in storm drains for days or weeks on end to launch a coordinated attack.<p>Bots are coming in war, like it or not.

What I think this illustrates is the quality/value of the wiki medium itself. I remember a lot of issues from my philosophy courses about wikipedia, the tutors seemed to think that the content of an article would change from day to day, one day taking one angle, the next being rewritten to another. I guess why I like this study is it shows the clear continuity of the information. Even though it is in constant flow. (hmmm....I wonder if there are computable threshold values? i.e. the age of an article, number of views/edits/users etc.)<p>I take your point, I did mean _wikipedia_ as there is no doubt that an in house wiki is a very good way of content management. But there are a lot of preconceived prejudices about open wiki's among the less well informed. I'm preaching to the converted here on HN, but then I thought people would appreciate the pretty colours =D",1232118913

My personal experience has been that even the best video production can be quickly tarnished by a voice-over that is casual, meandering, or inconsistent. For our demo video, we first sketched out what points we wanted to make in the video, wrote a draft script, then recorded nearly an hour of screen footage. My colleague then spent a couple of days locked in a room with iMovie and a microphone. We ended up with a five minute video that I think really captured what we were trying to do with our product. We used ffmpeg for conversion to mp4+h264 (and a fallback to flv), and the very respectable JW flash video player. I think Snapz Pro X was used for video capture.",1232118865

Why drop ads on people, when you can extract from them opinion that is probably more ""valuable"" than the small change from advertising?<p>Right now, they ask one question:  ""What are you doing?""  Why not ask other questions?  Rotate them, mix it up a little bit.

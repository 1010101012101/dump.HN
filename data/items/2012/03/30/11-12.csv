You need to figure out your plans and goals, and then implement those. If you can find these goals at your current job you'll probably stay, otherwise you should think about leaving. This is the same whether you're in a company of 1 or 100,000 people.<p>One thing larger corps will expose you to is bureaucracy and politics. It's actually quite handy to learn. It becomes evident when people don't have skills like allowing a party to save face. You absolutely have to work with people that get on your nerves again, you have to network, and in a few years they could be your boss. It's just the way things go.<p>> corresponding autonomy combined with a good manager leads to a good, productive, educational experience.<p>There are actually several different career desires. While autonomy could lead to a productive experience, it is not the only way. Certainly your autonomy could cause other problems. Some of the other career desires could be work/life balance, challenges, security, or advancement. In other words, you can still have a productive experience but put value on things other than autonomy. I do not doubt that a good manager will help you significantly.<p>My corporate job is dry at times. I do learn things and solve problems with scopes that few people would. Is it enough for me? I'm not sure, and it's certainly a good question to always be considering. I have started trending towards ""ask for forgiveness"" rather than to ask permission. So far that hasn't back fired, and that lets me work on some work related topics that I find interesting.<p>Is corporate good experience to have later in life? Yes. Like another post was saying about full QA test suites, standardized release processes, etc. You need exposure to these things, and how it's done ""in the big leagues."" Then you can go to a startup if you wish and choose to ignore certain aspects. But you know them, so it's not impossible to implement them later. That makes you infinitely more valuable than someone who does not have that knowledge.",1333108311

Its layout could use quite a bit of rethinking, focusing on improving usability for those who've only stumbled onto the debate after its conclusion (as I assume most of us have). I'm guessing that the format felt more natural and threadlike to those who were along for the ride from the get-go. But there's real value in being able to read the debate, after the fact, from start to finish in an intuitive and easy-to-follow fashion.<p>As for the content of the debate: I've been following Schneier's commentary on airport security for at least a few months now. What he's saying is no surprise to me. He's preaching to a choir of which I am a fast and firm member. On the other hand, I'm actually amazed at the willingness of his opponent (Kip Hawley) to concede some points that I would have thought were held as unshakable dogma amongst the TSA-apologist set. To me, genuine progress was made in this debate. This was not a case of two people's arguing pre-fixed talking points in circles around each other. This felt more like a real discussion, with give and take.<p>Kudos to The Economist for hosting this debate, and for attempting to innovate on the printed-debate format. To date, it's a format that nobody's quite nailed. (Nor, for that matter, has The Economist here). But it's an interesting step forward.",1333108022

Concurrency is not some accidental bolt-on in Erlang<p>You might want to read my comment correctly and avoid injecting things which are not in it.

But in any case Erlang's design and VM structure does make it suitable for soft real-time (per-process shared-nothing[0] heaps independently GC'd with configurable initial heaps, allowing such things as never GC'ing a process at all).

It also gives them an easy excuse to delete troll accounts. Furthermore, having people's real names (and often address etc.) makes them a more attractive target for advertisers. Most of the Facebook biographers seem to agree that the real-name policy was one of the factors that helped it win out over MySpace and other social networks. (Among many, many others, of course.)<p>In light of how much money this policy is presumably making them, and considering that they have about a billion customers who seem to accept the policy as is, I strongly suspect they don't care in the least that the occasional person with an unusual name falls through the cracks, or that they're screwing over people who need to remain anonymous for legitimate safety reasons.<p>Do I agree with their decision?

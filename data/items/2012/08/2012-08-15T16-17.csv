I hear great things about a system in France called velib (I think).<p><i>Edit: I forgot to mention, the German bikes also have a second seat on the back.

4386856,comment,4385241,4386744,5,0,w1ntermute,,,"> As I walked out of the Van Ness MUNI station in San Francisco last night, I walked by at least 20 homeless people, just lying on the street. A couple on wheelchairs, the rest just lounging around. A few of them reeked of urine and feces.<p>> And this is in, arguably, one of the richest cities in America.<p>You're conveniently ignoring several points. First of all, San Francisco draws homeless from all over the nation because it (a) has good weather year round and (b) is quite liberal and will tolerate and help the homeless. Unlike India, in much of the US, being homeless during the winter means that you will quite literally freeze to death. So the homeless tend to congregate in places where the weather is favorable for outdoor living year round. The fact that San Francisco is rich is a result of Silicon Valley, which developed where it has because of the proximity of the Stanford campus. So the two issues are not exactly connected.<p>More importantly, attempts to help the homeless on the streets of SF have been made over and over (and are ongoing). Many of these people <i>refuse</i> to leave the streets. Some of them even enjoy it. Many others suffer from mental disorders, but we can't force them to live in asylums (which was the case until the 1980s) - that would be inhumane, or so the argument goes.<p>As for India, its level of poverty is so staggering that any comparison to America or another first world nation is entirely pointless. Let's see what UNICEF has to say about child malnutrition, for example[0]:<p>> Malnutrition is more common in India than in Sub-Saharan Africa. One in every three malnourished children in the world lives in India.<p>So India has worse child malnutrition than even <i>Africa</i>. How you can even begin to compare this to some bums on the street in SF is entirely beyond me.<p>0: <a href=""http://www.unicef.org/india/children_2356.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unicef.org/india/children_2356.htm</a>",1345049712

4386810,comment,4382824,4386567,1,0,anulman,,,"Again, you're right on the fact, but not on the interpretation. The medallion system used by most cities restricts the number of cars on the road in a city. However:<p>1) Most taxi fleets -- <i>especially</i> the larger ones -- collect monthly rent from car owners, rather than own a ton of medallions themselves. The medallion system benefits owners of medallions, not fleets. This distinction, while invisible to the masses, is incredibly important.<p>2) It's definitely not rare for new fleets to pop up. We talk with plenty of folks who own fleets that are only one or two years old. All you need is a subset of drivers (and/or owners!), a couple of regular clients, and a little gumption. New fleets <i>are</i> popping up, and trying to innovate as best they can. The new, lower-priced, often mobile-based dispatch systems I mentioned in a previous comment have really been a boon to this segment.<p>3) In most cities, black car licenses are similarly restricted to medallions. The limits may not be posted, but they exist. In fact, a great article about Uber in The Atlantic exposed this issue in DC back in May[1].<p>4) Again, fleets working with us are achieving similar results; companies like Hailo and GetTaxi (who seem to be trying to work within the system) are as well.<p>In short: the medallion system is a red herring when it comes to stifling innovation. It is definitely an issue, one that tends to marginalize drivers and unnecessarily restrict supply for passengers. But every one of the companies you and I have mentioned abide by the restrictions it imposes, so your point is moot.<p>Going back to my original issue: I have <i>no</i> problem with challenging rules, conventions, and decisions (I'm an entrepreneur, posting on HN... do you really expect me to disagree here?). My issue lies in Uber's underhanded approach, where they both flout actually sensible laws and arguably force governments to send C&Ds by refusing to engage with them when initially approached.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/05/why-you-can-8217-t-get-a-taxi/8942/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/05/why-you-...</a>",1345049075

4386756,comment,4385969,4386401,0,0,snprbob86,,,"> For non-trivial distributed systems, behaviors that are correct for network transport use cases that are built into ZeroMQ are pathological for distributed system use cases.<p>I'm not sure what you mean. Please provide one or more concrete examples.<p>> ZeroMQ is a good for moving bits over a network but it is often not a correct choice for distributed systems.<p>It seems to me that distributed systems are <i>defined</i> by moving bits over a network.<p>You're right that there is some confusion regarding what ZeroMQ actually us. This is in no small part due to it's unfortunate name: ZeroMQ isn't a queue. It is implemented with queues, but that's because it sends and receives discrete messages instead of bytes, like it's underlying protocols. The underlying transport protocols use ""buffers"" to store bytes on their way from your application to their destination. When you have a buffer of <i>messages</i>, that's called a queue!<p>ZeroMQ is a network protocol for messaging. If you need custom scheduling, load balancing, etc, you can send and receive control messages on a secondary channel. The ZeroMQ Guide [1] is extremely enlightening in this regard. It's worth reading even if you never use ZeroMQ because all of the underlying principals apply to any network transport.<p>[1] <a href=""http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all</a>",1345048429

This is an article by someone who doesn't understand Apple's unique value proposition.<p>Apple isn't really about making devices with the highest specs out there (things like retina displays are the exception, not the rule), nor are they about innovating brand-new types of devices (there were plenty of Mp3 players around before the iPod, plenty of tablet PCs around before the iPad, and plenty of Palm and Windows Mobile smartphones around before the iPhone).<p>What they are about is building things that do what they do, extremely well.<p>Part of this is design, part of this is their legendary supply chain (though that's a relatively recent advantage) but in my opinion the most important part of this is an intentional willingness to sacrifice features for user experience.<p>My first iPhone was the 4, and when it came out, I was debating between it and the Evo 4G.  On paper, the Evo 4G was a higher spec device.  Hell, it's right in the name. It had 4G.<p>I'm very glad I went with the iPhone.

Plus the low end devices have (had?) slow processors which make a lot of the fancier CSS stuff unusable.<p>On top of that, how many people will even know and use the bada app store?<p>Oh and nowhere in that mini-article is it mentioned that Bada will probably-maybe be replaced by another OS, Tizen.",1345046838

I don't understand the common mindset of the government being somehow 'special', and not shaped by the same influences and subject to the same failure modalities as every other institution in society.<p>Human society itself is a ""network effect"", and the ability to form connections within that network without artificial constraint is the <i>definition</i> of freedom.<p>Society is <i>defined</i> by what you're calling ""boundaries and entanglements"", or what less cynical people might call ""well-defined communities and relationships""; there's <i>never</i> room for completely unencumbered individual decision-making: individuals are always constrained by the laws of nature and the existence of those other people with whom they share a common social space.  Maximizing individual liberty means maximizing individuals' ability to choose whether to participate in a particular social context, whether to opt out and go it alone, or whether to attempt to forge their own new social context.  Flattening down all of the boundaries and subjecting all social contexts to monopolistic rules only reduces choice and makes one social context dominate over all others - <i>this</i> is hardly a path to freedom.<p>I admit, though, that I've got no idea what a ""burbclave"" is - I understand it's a concept from Snow Crash, which, regrettably, I have yet to read.

The part of the story where a whistleblower decides not to go public after consulting with their lawyer strikes me as totally plausible. You could think of being a whistleblower as kind of the career equivalent of firing a gun at someone who you're pretty sure is an armed intruder in your home. Yes, if you have the facts right you're probably entitled to do it and (if it will protect other people) it might well be the right thing to do. No, that doesn't mean your life won't get complicated for a while afterward -- especially if the facts aren't what you thought they were, or you miss.<p>I think whistleblowers are incredibly important to society, and there are often good laws to protect them. But they're doing something <i>brave</i>. By far the easiest and safest path is to just look the other way.

Any number of people have completely opposing ideas of what Hacker News should be. Everything one person finds interesting is completely noise to someone else.<p>You could apply user-level filters to the threads, I suppose - choose longer words over shorter, or longer posts over shorter posts, remove posts with words or phrases you object to. Hacker News could mitigate this single-channel effect by allowing tags or sub-boards, but I believe their solution so far is for the mods to manually tweak things when some stories get too popular. The site already puts high-karma posts at the top, which is supposed to act as a qualifier through consensus.<p>But to me, it seems the more you try to engineer the experience of discovery though automation, the less likely it is you&#x27;ll discover things which might be interesting, but unexpected.",1415577258

Architect your software stack properly using repositories/interfaces and develop against these if you are worried about lock-in to Azure - done correctly it will allow you to adopt a hybrid approach of mix and match of offerings between vendors.<p>Some basic considerations:<p>a) Ability to find quality .NET talent in your local area? (It&#x27;s not hard to stand out and attract quality developers in .NET simply by adopting a strong open-source usage/contribution policy. Using languages such as F# behind the scenes will make you stick out even more.)<p>b) .NET makes hiring simpler - you&#x27;ll obtain the opportunity to use and reuse the same language/code on the server-side as on the client side. Using Xamarin means you don&#x27;t need to hire a Android mobile guy to do the app, then hire a iOS guy to redo the same project in another language. You get product/feature release parity for essentially free.<p>c) Are you in this for the long haul or are you aiming for exit?

Questioning her at the airport is one means of investigation.<p>Based on the descriptions given in the two articles I linked to, she traveled out of country 40 times over the course of 6 years, went to places like Iraq and Yemen, and openly hung out with Sunni insurgents and two close associates of Osama bin Laden - on top of already being reported filming at the scene of an ambush on US troops that resulted in multiple casualties.

Sith Lord Zuck has set you free as in beer, but not in speech.  Urbit will set you free as in speech, but not as in beer.<p>The difference is simply that while there are a limited number of Urbit identities (or at least memorable identities, ie, 32-bit &quot;destroyers&quot;) in the world, and therefore they can&#x27;t possibly be made free as in beer, <i>neither I nor my evil minions</i> have any practical power over a destroyer once we create it.<p>Moreover, if you genuinely think of any individual or organization involved with Urbit as evil, there are plenty of independent carrier-holders you can get a destroyer from.  (~del, for instance, will ship destroyers when we do, I think. He&#x27;s some guy in Rochester whom I don&#x27;t know from Adam.  So, we&#x27;ll let him serve the first 16 million people who want to escape from our evil dictatorship.)<p>Yes, by default the normal way to get onto Urbit will feel like the normal way to get onto Facebook.  However, even if you are initially issued and hosted by us, you can move your image at any time to any other host, or to your own machine.  Currently there&#x27;s no way to stop using your issuing carrier for network services, such as firewall hole punching, but this is obviously a 1.0 feature.  By design, there is no sort of leverage you can&#x27;t escape from.<p>So Urbit strikes a sort of balance between governed and ungoverned networks.  The limited address space will hopefully make it economically impractical to abuse the network for profit - a spammer is always a Sybil attacker.  But as a destroyer you are not ruled by any master you can&#x27;t easily escape from.  The only thing you can&#x27;t escape is your own reputation.

What does &quot;right&quot; mean, and what is &quot;the job?&quot; If you are at the point where certain databases simply <i>won&#x27;t work</i>, then of course there&#x27;s a way to measure this, but most of us are not in this situation. There is operational and mental overhead for each data store you choose. If you end up running half a dozen data stores because for some esoteric reason they didn&#x27;t feel quite &quot;right&quot; for each individual problem, you&#x27;re going to have a much different system if you compromised on having a &quot;suboptimal&quot; general purpose data store that could be re-used for several of them. There are all sorts of negative downstream effects of introducing a new data store, which can bleed all the way up to the higher level organizational structure.<p>When you consider the fact that deciding something is the &quot;best&quot; tool is often an exercise in prediction, it&#x27;s pretty clear that it&#x27;s easy to get wrong so a strong argument can be made you should lean towards one general purpose data store for most projects until incidental complexity from &#x27;impedence mismatch&#x27; or performance needs dictate a change. If I had to choose, I&#x27;d say you should have a RDBMS and a persistent durable log. (Like Kafka.) There is something fundamental about representing your data as tables and events (one is just a projection of the other.) From there, a document store, k-v store, graph, fancy distributed sharded system, etc, are essentially optimizations or &#x27;sugar&#x27; over the same data and so YMMV as to when to introduce them.",1415575395

Border control has very broad authority to search and question anyone coming into the US, and some office at DHS may be very interested in her but the equivalent office at FBI might not have the time or inclination to pursue it further, especially if the searches and questioning keep turning up nothing.  I worked in the military in the past and have seen plenty of examples of government organizations with different but slightly overlapping missions.  They tend to step on each others&#x27; toes just as often if not more often than they work together effectively.<p>I also have no idea if the FBI pursued it further and got a warrant.  They&#x27;re under no obligation to inform someone that they&#x27;re under investigation.  They may very well have started up a case against her that&#x27;s still open, or may have investigated her and eventually dropped the case, or may not have done anything at all.

Unfortunately this is now rapidly slipping toward 20.<p>Of course, Kloc is a deceptive measure of algorithmic simplicity in a functional language, if compared to procedural.

Pages that are hot in PG&#x27;s buffer cache are likely to stay there, making the same page in the OS buffer cache cold (because there aren&#x27;t many requests for it). That&#x27;s not always true, because writes to hot pages will end up going through the OS buffer cache maybe a couple times per checkpoint cycle, but it&#x27;s still not (on average) stored twice. I don&#x27;t have empirical numbers here, unfortunately, so someone else can correct me and fill in details.<p>At least from the discussions I&#x27;ve seen, there isn&#x27;t a lot of interest in using O_DIRECT or otherwise taking on the I/O scheduling problem into postgres. It&#x27;s not particularly exciting to me, because<p>* Takes on the I/O scheduling problem, rather than the simpler method now of just handing pages to the kernel for lazy writing, and fsync&#x27;ing at checkpoint time.<p>* Requires a lot of new code, tuning, configuration, etc. with a high maintenance cost.<p>* Not portable, so it&#x27;s easy to make a tweak that helps on kernel and HW configuration X but hurts on kernel and HW configuration Y.<p>* Not very strategic: it helps some workloads with a lot of real I/O by some small constant factor; which doesn&#x27;t necessarily open up new use cases or market opportunities<p>In my opinion, it&#x27;s much better to focus on innovative features, or more low-hanging performance gains (which exist in postgres), or scale-out features. All of those will be slowed down if the code becomes bulkier (making correct patches harder to write, especially for new developers) and the maintainers become distracted by I/O scheduling issues.<p>It seems more like something to do when innovation slows enough, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t seem worth it.",1415574530

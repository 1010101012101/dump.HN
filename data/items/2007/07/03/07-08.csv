32224,comment,32165,32165,0,0,davidw,,,"Like all things, though, some moderation is probably a good idea.  Even if this argument makes perfect logical sense, it makes apes unhappy to see other apes getting way more bananas than they are, and if you start to talk politics rather than simply economics, this has practical consequences.  Better to balance things out a little bit before things get out of hand and the apes with few bananas vote in someone with truly bad ideas about redistributing wealth.<p>I once saw a not-really-serious idea by a center-left economist that having money is good and just, as the article says, but perhaps what should be taxed are the very visible bananas (fancy cars, ""bling"") that the better off apes use to flaunt their wealth.",1183447467

Still, it is an achievement if you manage to bank on that desire. <p>I for one look forward to Harry Potter VII for my dose of magic - much cheaper, and probably much better than the iPhone, too.",1183446889
32221,comment,32208,32208,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"Who are you targeting with this site - people who already use Kratom but are actively searching for a better price? How many people are searching for Kratom? I know I've never heard of it. <p>Frankly, I think this is a bit of an ill conceived plan. You're basically trying to catch people who are already using and are familiar with a niche incense, by promising to sell it at a discount. How price sensitive are people using niche incense going to be? Versus trusting a new supplier off the internet? So lets run through it - right now your page would convert someone that:<p>1) Uses Kratom\n2) Sees your advertising\n3) Is concerned about saving, er, actually, looking at your site, maybe a few percent on something that costs next to nothing\n4) Is concerned enough about that saving to buy off of a new one page site on the internet<p>All while you are presumably running razor thin margins and paying for the advertising. Razor thin margins could work when you are making up for it at a large volume, but I don't think the market is big enough for that. My father is  working on a site that does exactly what you're doing, but for 10,000 products instead of 1 and attempting to catch organic search traffic. Many products haven't ever been sold, and individually the traffic per product is very little, but it's the area under the curve that counts. It's very Web 0.2, but when selling to average people, that doesn't matter.<p>You might want to consider turning the site into a Kratom info page that only incidentally sells it. Make comparison pages with whatever else is similar to it (types of incense I guess?) that will show up in organic search under other terms. Pages of info or uses or whatever that'll show up in organic search. Your page rather snarkily tells me to learn how to search the internet. I'm sorry, but if I don't take the time to research the product you are selling and find out if I want to buy it, that's not _my_ problem, that's _YOUR_ problem. I clicked on the Wikipedia link and I still don't know what it is... I mean, I know that it's some plant from Asia that can be burned as insence... but I don't know why I would care (sell me on the benefits and maybe I'd try it).<p>There's another thing you could try, and it'll cost money and probably won't work (but if it does it'll be passive income for a long time). It'll only have a chance of working if Kratom is relatively obscure (one supplier in the world, I'm presuming it is). You'll also have to track things well.<p>But what you could do is stop selling it at a discount, and bid on ad words for words like incense, pointing to a page saying exactly the problem you're facing. Say how good it is, and that you've got the ability to supply Kratom and nobody really knows about it, but you believe in it so much that you'll personally send out a sample to anyone in the US that wants one. Full instructions how to use it etc. Fulfill 100 or 200 orders and run the numbers. You've paid maybe 1000 x 10 cents to get those people to fill out the form, maybe $100. You've paid for the samples of Kratom, maybe $5 per person. X of those people loved it and will become customers - you've got to work out the gross and net value of each customer, that is, average sale price x frequency of sale x time they stay customers (could be a hell of a long time). There is obviously a bit of guess work here. So there you'd have a $x of advertising expenditure gets you y customers who will on average bring in $z profit each. If you make decent margins (to pay for your time), keep doing this for years and you'll make a reasonable amount from the site. If you don't, try something else a bit radical, or ditch the whole thing and try something else (recommended).",1183446786

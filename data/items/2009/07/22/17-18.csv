The power and flexibility of the codebase is incredible for the high level of abstraction it's working at.<p>Granted, almost any of the architecture choices can be questioned or even ridiculed, but that's inevitable when you are trying to be all things to all people.

I can't stand Drupal and will never work with it again.  I think building a career on Drupal will severely limit your skillset, and I think time estimation and client relationship management is made much more difficult for a web developer due to the byzantine constraints it imposes.

As an engineering student we have to do a project this semester (July 20 - Nov 30) and according to me this is a great way to learn something new and interesting and also get grades out of it.<p>Well, so the requirement of the <i>University-Project</i> I'm planning to do IMO is ,<p>Platform : Unix like ( strict no to windows)<p>Language : Python, can go for other languages like Objective C but python is my primary choice<p>Orientation : Something industry-oriented so that I can boast of it, say after I graduate<p>Scalability : Can be completed within 1 semester<p>Objective : Learn a language, get familiar with my MBP<p>In a recent discussion following on the line of my requirement someone gave the idea of 'Integrating Launchpad and Wave' which I'm not sure can be practical but it was a good idea. However I'm looking forward to ideas from HN.",1248282412

This application sits in an iframe.  You want to make sure that it's only being used on sites from the *.example.com domains.<p>So, you set a cookie in the .example.com domain, and then, on the server side, you create a one-way hash of that cookie and a key phrase (a crumb), and put it on the url of the iframe.<p>The key phrase doesn't have to be particularly secret, it's mostly for convenience so that you can use the same cookie and hash function in multiple different applications without getting the same crumb everywhere for a given user.  So, if a crumb is leaked, it's only going to expose one thing, not everything.  Also, if you make it time-dependent, then it further limits the exposure.<p>The iframe validates that the crumb in the query string matches the one-way hash that it gets by performing the same one-way hash against the cookies and the key phrase.<p>Yahoo uses this technique all over the place.  It's very effective as long as the crumb function is sufficiently clever.  However, if your crumb is brute-forcible, then it can be exploited easily.",1248282361

There are tons of searches in Google that result in links to the forums where somebody is asking ""Hey, this is my situation, can anybody help me?"" only to see a response that is irrelevant or no response at all. I had to dig through the X.org wiki, which isn't terribly good documentation, to figure out how to disable mouse acceleration (after experimenting with where to put the settings).<p>Regarding the article: many of these points seem really vague or <i>really</i> nit-picky, like the bit about drive encryption.<p>I also agree with you about Ubuntu not trying to be Windows. I think they want to instill the paradigm <i>if you're going to change a setting, be prepared to do it as a superuser or root ahead of time</i>. Linux security isn't going to change to be more like Windows security.",1248282157

His involvement as the UI team lead is, however, public information. His credentials are not the main issue, of course.<p>There are serious quality issues along the entire codebase and a number of snippets that strongly suggest the team&#x27;s primary skill is not JS. Given the cost and gravity of the project, I believe it is fair to say that the American public expects (and deserves) better. It speaks to the vast inefficiencies of the RFP process and gov IT contracting in general that code quality is so far down on the priority list.<p>It&#x27;s not just aesthetic, either. There are serious functionality issues, as anybody who has used the site will attest to. And those bugs are not just limited to the backend. Backend bugs have seriously compromised the security of user accounts [1] and frontend bugs prevent major sections of the site from running at all [2].<p>It is one thing when ugly code is &quot;successfully deployed to solve problems&quot;. It is quite another when ugly code on such a high-profile, expensive project is deployed to such disastrous effect.<p>The constructive part of the post is the repository I linked to (issues are being reported and fixed, for better or worse), and in bringing attention to the fact that government IT does not follow serious engineering practices. Serious attention needs to be brought to the problem so that it can be fixed. I am not happy about it, I am not pointing fingers with glee. I just hope that it has embarrassed HHS & the administration enough to make substantive change.<p>1. <a href=""http://blog.isthereaproblemhere.com/2013/10/does-healthcaregov-violate-their-own.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.isthereaproblemhere.com/2013/10/does-healthcareg...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://blog.isthereaproblemhere.com/2013/11/stuck-in-middle-of-healthcaregov.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.isthereaproblemhere.com/2013/11/stuck-in-middle-...</a>",1383803857

I did get a close look at the whole patent suit process later, when a patent that I am a co-inventor on ended up involved in a lawsuit (not of my choice or with my approval), so I got to be deposed a couple times, answer a lot of questions from lawyers, and spend a month living in an annoying hotel in Texas for the trial, and while there got to talk a lot with the lawyers.

Their answer does not give much detail.<p>Your speculation in the last paragraph, that this is normal for answers to complaints, is also correct I believe. The complaint and answer are not where the parties start to argue the case. The complaint is to tell the court what wrong you think was done to you, and why you think the court has jurisdiction over the defendant and over the subject matter.<p>The answer is to tell the court which things in the complaint that you concede are true, which you claim are false, and which you cannot answer at this time because you do not have enough information.<p>Basically, the complaint and answer together let the court know what it is dealing with.<p>The meaty details start coming in when the suit gets to the stage where the parties are filing pre-trial motions for things like summary judgement on various parts of the complaint, and later when the trial actually gets underway.",1383802808

I don&#x27;t know enough of the details of the accident to hazard a guess as to whether this device would have worked better.)  Probably, there are some accidents where a helmet would work better, but I have no problem believing there are many where this device would perform better.  (It&#x27;s much larger, when inflated, giving it much better cushioning ability.  Helmets, as noted elsewhere in this thread, aren&#x27;t very good at preventing concussions -- I expect this device would be much better.)",1383801642

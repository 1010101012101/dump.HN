Well, sure, actually.  Check your email right now.  And every 5 minutes while you're awake for the rest of the year.<p>When you get an email from a user, reply to it.  Get into a conversation with your users.  Find out who they are.  Tell them what features you're thinking about adding next, and ask for their opinions.<p>The biggest problem you'll ever have with collecting feature requests is the people who have great ideas but are too polite to bother you with them.  If you can get those people to see you as a friendly human rather than as a faceless business, they'll be far more likely to send you their ideas.",1234519153

Often, the only ones that can be found are indirect, imprecise, and have other problems associated with them. From my point of view, these problems can be tolerated. The specific scales of measure, and meters for measuring, can always be worked on, and improved over time.

479667,comment,479165,479165,0,0,yason,,,"Where comes the notion that it were to be either this or that?<p>Why not use a relational database for data that actually suits the relational model, and an object/hierarchical/keyvalue database for complete entities that are often mapped to objects in code? Just put each kind of data to a storage that makes sense.<p>If you start with a RDBMS, there are plenty of options of how to store the objects. You can just use plain files in the simplest case. Or a good dbm style database. Or if your objects are mostly read-only you can keep the data in the RDB and cache the big joins. Or if you're really stuck with the RDB only you can even store the key-value pairs in the RDB: just make a two-column table for run-time data and keep it separate from the actual relational data. Or keep everything in the RDB but make a live copy off the RDB when the user logs in to keep the runtime data accessible and then unpack it back to the RDB lazily or when the user logs out. There are pretty much endless possibilities depending on your business and search needs.<p>Ain't easy but non-trivial databases never are.",1234517975

479656,comment,479314,479398,0,0,jefffoster,,,"Programmers are often a very poor judge of productivity.  I've seen many Java programmers say they've had a productive day, but then I find they've typed 1001 getters/setters and intricately JavaDoc'd them.  This is productive typing practice, but little more.  In a similar vein, it's easy to feel productive if you're doing refactoring all day, but what has this actually achieved?<p>One aspect of TDD that isn't often quoted is that it helps get a concrete measure of productivity (and it's one of the themes of Beck's book).  If you can see that today you've knocked out 100 tests, that's some measure of progress.  It's a running theme through agile-processes.  Small iterations / stories / code changes with measurable outcomes.",1234517721

479638,comment,479314,479398,0,0,akeefer,,,"In my experience, programmers think they know when they're being productive, but they're often wrong:  for example, coding for 5 hours straight without realizing the time has passed might feel productive, but if you've been doing the wrong thing, or writing buggy or hacked-up code that will cost you in the long run, you probably haven't been nearly as productive as you think you have.  Likewise, I often feel totally unproductive when pair programming, because everything feels slow and I'm not just cranking on something, but if I try to think about it objectively it's often the case that I get more done in that time by avoiding mistakes, finding better ways to do things, and by only doing the minimal necessary work.  Similarly, to the point of the article, productivity of a team is a different metric than productivity of an individual:  interrupting me might cost me 15 minutes of work, but if it saves someone else two hours of wasted work it's a big net win for the team.<p>That's not to say that programmers have no clue, just that our internal radar isn't exactly infallible.  People tend to feel ""productive"" when they feel like they're ""getting a lot done,"" but real productivity depends on whether you're doing the right things and whether you're doing them well.<p>And, let's face it, most programmers (myself included) really enjoy that feeling of just cranking on something and becoming so engrossed that they don't notice time pass.  So I think that people are biased towards thinking that always corresponds with maximum productivity simply because it's enjoyable, and not because it's truly always optimal.",1234515792

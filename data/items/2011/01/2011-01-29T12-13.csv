I've build a very limited prototype http://tymr.com in the last month!<p>I've build this because I believe that Social Networking should be about people interactions in real life.
And people connect through events such as a casual dinner, a music festival or a conference.<p>tymr aims to facilitate users with the task of managing and promoting events, through a social and collaborative network, in order to enhance the overall experience.
Using innovative communication solutions based on Web technologies and features and betaking the organics of the social network fostered by the interaction of the participants, the service will be an asset not only in terms of promotion, but also in the planning, creation, monitoring and sharing event of any size.
Therefore, the platform will also be a means of excellence for events publishing. In this regard, we intend to surprise the users through a system of effective recommendations, foreseeing the intended research and finding events according to their likes and geographical location.<p>Looking forward to your feedback!",1296305128

Maybe their actions are not criminal in general terms, but it's at least scammy (not to say worse) when you look at it considering only this narrow subject (getting information through the internet). Google needs to do a better job, yes, just like lawmakers need to do it IRL, but it doesn't change the fact that IRL also mostly criminals are the ones that force the law system to adjust.

2155286,comment,2154106,2154106,0,0,retube,,,"We went through a similar, albeit much smaller, acquisition process recently. However the general principles still apply:<p>1) If they are genuine bidders, then there will be room for negotiation. How much of course depends on a) how much they want to buy and b) how much you are prepared to sell for. Anyway, if they are genuine buyers they will be prepared to negotiate. If they are not, or you can not agree on a deal, then you haven't lost anything (except perhaps some lawyer fees) so don't stress.<p>2) You should negotiate both the price, the cash/stock mix and the terms. This latter is by far and away the most complex, and YOU MUST GET A GOOD LAWYER TO ADVISE. The devil is in the details, and as you mention, you must make sure they can't do something like arbitarily fire you and take away your stock.<p>3) Figure out where you are prepared to sell for. Pitch this to them. Don't be a pussy about this. After the back and forth, if you can agree on broad terms great.<p>4) They will probably want to draw up the contracts. Of course this means the deal will be weighted in their favour, hence YOU MUST HAVE A LAWTER TO ADVISE - and be prepared to haggle on the various clauses.<p>5) I would say vested stock is pretty common. But you must make sure you are protected against dilution. And you must check the details concerning the circumstances under which they can take your stock. E.g losing your stock for anything other than gross negligence is a no no.<p>Good luck!",1296303276

  Hosni Mubarak, or (presumably) whoever succeeds him as 
  head of state. It is hard to envision why a head of state 
  would want or need his own private tube full of air running 
  underneath the Sahara. The obvious guess is that the duct 
  might be used to create a secure communications system, 
  independent of the civilian and military systems (the 
  Egyptian military will own one of the six ducts, and ARENTO 
  will own three). This, in and of itself, says something 
  about the relationship between the military and the

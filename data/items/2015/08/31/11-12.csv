But those who I have come across find macroevolution very hard to believe and have no qualms with small variations among &quot;species&quot;. They say that there were different sets of creation which then something happened to one set(died out?) and another set was put in place. Also the fact that scientists admit themselves they have pretty much no idea how life first began. These are the two biggest issues of contention for most people.<p>A few other criticisms I&#x27;ve heard from people:\n- How many times have scientists claimed to be certain about something with their &quot;evidence&quot; and then switched their position at another time? I know this is seen as a plus to many but it&#x27;s not an invalid concern.\n- Science cannot nor does it claim to be something one can use to acquire certainty about anything. You can&#x27;t really prove anything with the scientific method. It&#x27;s based on observation and induction(not mathematical) which are inherently flawed. \n- From the most basic interactions people have with science is food and medicine. We&#x27;ve seen how &quot;great&quot; GMO&#x27;s have been and how many medicines have harmed people and have been taken off the shelves. It&#x27;s not strange for someone to go to 5 different doctors with one set of symptoms and get 5 different diagnoses each with a different solution.<p>Before I&#x27;m attacked, I want to mention I am conveying what I&#x27;ve heard.

As an organist, Bach was used to being heavily restrained in which keys and intervals could be used while dodging the many obstacles that were dissonances in the instrument&#x27;s tuning.<p>The purpose of Well temperament, used on the harpsichord, was to get rid of those limitations and gain the ability to transpose everything freely while remaining consonant and in-tune. In this way, the Well temperament can be seen as an approximation of equal temperament in a time when the mathematical tools to achieve it were not really known.<p>To me, it&#x27;s pretty clear that the WTC is Bach gleefully exploring the freedom of transposition-invariance and free modulation. In other words: Bach would have <i>loved</i> the equal temperament, and this article would likely give him a hearty chuckle.<p>I like natural intervals, but dividing the octave in 12 tones is a rather inappropriate way of using them. European classical music adopted this system early on, and therefore was doomed to end up on the equal temperament at some point. It&#x27;s not the ultimate system nor the end of temperaments, but it&#x27;s been really, <i>really</i> useful.",1441019002

Consider a degenerative mental disease like Alzheimer&#x27;s; does the idea of suffering from that, or someone in your family suffering from that, bother you? Why? If the disease robbed you/them of all sense of self, including any part of you/them that would be bothered by it, does that mean there&#x27;s no harm done because you/they are no longer aware of it? Assuming you find that concept as horrific as I do, then a more permanent loss of any &quot;sense of self&quot; should be quite analogous.</i><p>I like that you&#x27;re actually trying to answer my question instead of being dismissive about it.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s difficult to compare Alzheimer&#x27;s with cessation of existence in this manner.  One is the process of losing your sense of self.  I agree that must be extremely frightening.  Losing control of yourself is no doubt hard.<p>However, in discussing death, I am referring to the result, not the process.  The process of suffering leading to death can horrific, especially if disease is the cause.  The end result of not existing, I am not able to put in the same sentence like you do.  Even after carefully reading your explanation, it seems to me that you&#x27;ve done a masterful job explaining why the process is horrifying.  But I already agree with that.  You haven&#x27;t been able to explain to me why the result after the process is over is so scary.<p>It may be possible we&#x27;d just end up going in circles about this, which would be too bad.  I am seriously waiting for someone to explain to me in a manner that I can understand why cessation of existence is so terrifying to them.<p>edit addendum: Questions regarding scarcity and whether it can be resolved even with new technology and expansion to other galaxies unfortunately cannot be easily resolved until it happens.  That being said, I have little faith that humanity can have that Star Trek epiphany.  We have enough food to end world hunger today.  The problem is distribution and individuals willing to sacrifice for the greater good.  This is true for both third world nations that experience famine and inner city slums in the first world.  The political will simply isn&#x27;t there.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I really do wish I could think better of humanity.",1441018910

GUN requires no additional maintenance because it gets embedded into your app, compared to most databases which require you to run (and maintain) a database server.<p>If you do not want to even run your own app servers, I&#x27;m more then happy to let you use my free GUN backend so that way you do not even have to worry about that.<p>Consensus? Absolutely not. I definitely need to add more documentation and resources on this - in fact I&#x27;m doing a talk on how my conflict resolution algorithm works out in Berlin in a few weeks. Check the conference out at: <a href=""https://2015.distributed-matters.org/ber/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://2015.distributed-matters.org/ber/</a> . After that I should have much better materials on this available for people.<p>Briefly and naively, the way it works is a Vector Clock + Timestamp combo. Timestamps have bad exploits, and Vector Clocks don&#x27;t work well in ephemeral environments. If you combine the two together they compensate for the vulnerabilities of the other. Every peer acts as a state machine operating inside of an open-closed boundary function (nothing fancy here, this is the same stuff you learned in middle/highschool). This does NOT give you Global Consistency, as different peers might have slightly different boundaries because of clock drift (you can use a separate service to minimize this), but they will all become Eventually Consistent.<p>This helpful?

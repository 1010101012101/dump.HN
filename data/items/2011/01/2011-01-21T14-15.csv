Very sorry you had to do too much UML on that last project but it works very well for what it is: a universal way of diagramming parts of computer systems for purposes of communicating about them. Probably not so good as a universal spec system, or a runnable model, or any one of the 17 other things folks thought they could do with it. Same goes for a lot of this other stuff. We confuse the environment around a tool or technology with the tech itself.<p>Everything is overhyped. We're like that: we want magic bullets to fix all of our problems. Everything is over-applied and over-promised.<p>The more I think about it, the more this is a really bad, perhaps trollish, question. It does nothing to increase people's understanding, and only serves to have a place to gripe and complain. Nothing wrong with griping or complaining! As long as we all realize how subjective it is.

The language itself was recently open sourced, there's a VS vim plugin written in the language, and there's at least some game development going on in the language. F# is my language this year and I'm using it as an excuse to learn the environment. I've always been more impressed with .net and its attendant technologies than I have been with the JVM.<p>OSS on .net is weird in that commercial pressures and Microsoft's anchoring of the system warp it a bit. Things are located in weird places (codeplex) and discussions happen in weird places. The community is also fairly cut off from the *nix oriented OSS community.

2127467,comment,2127134,2127134,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Another problem with regular expressions is using them inappropriately. If you have elaborate, convoluted regular expressions, it's usually a sign that you should try using a parser as well. Regular expressions cannot maintain context (though some extensions have ad hoc extensions for doing this inefficiently and in a limited fashion; apparently the problem is NP-complete), so doing things like balancing parenthesis or HTML tags in a recursive expression is impossible.<p>Using regular expressions to break the input text into tokens (""tokenizing"" or ""lexing"") and then matching the sequence of tokens according to a grammar (""parsing"") is usually much simpler. The two-phase approach often factors out some complexity - only the lexer needs to care about things like whitespace, for example.<p>While most compiler textbooks cover lexing and parsing, I particularly recommend Andrew Appel's _Modern Compiler Implementation in ML_ and Niklaus Wirth's _Compiler Construction_ (free online, <a href=""http://www-old.oberon.ethz.ch/WirthPubl/CBEAll.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-old.oberon.ethz.ch/WirthPubl/CBEAll.pdf</a>).<p>More recommendations on learning parsing here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1820858"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1820858</a>",1295621250

To maximize the number of satisfied customers, you must ultimately run your product past many, many people who ultimately won't be satisfied customers.<p>Meanwhile, I can't help but fear that this poll is just another measurement of popular fashion: Once a technology has found its niche, can we really judge its ultimate importance without being experts in the niche? We can all tell when something becomes unfashionable, but it's quite hard to know just what its ongoing impact really is. Unfashionable technologies fade into the woodwork, but they do vital work nonetheless. Was COBOL overhyped? Was Perl overhyped?  Can I really claim that XML was overhyped, even as I type words into a machine built largely out of XML-based config files? When I pound the table and declare that, say, Java was overhyped, am I really saying more about myself than I am about Java?

Some database-y things are possible with XML, but you'd be crazy to replace a massive schema with it without good reason.<p>OOP is another great one. It is incredibly useful to write OOP code. However, the promise at the beginning of the OOP mania was that you could ""snap code together as easily as Legos... even normal people will be able to write complex software!"".

The same library exists there too, with the same problems, but switching to the cl-ppcre library made the problem disappear instantly.<p>One problem with Scheme itself appears to be that there is no way to examine a portion of a string. The substring function actually makes a whole new copy of the part you want to examine (which may be the remainder of the input string after the token you just lexed, as it was in my case).<p>Most of the string functions in Common Lisp are set up so that you can specify a starting index in a string so that it is possible to examine portions of a string without making a whole new copy.",1295619627

Used properly it allows you to very quickly write a 'low ceremony but high fidelity' server based system.  If you make some simplifying assumptions you can have all the Ajax you want too.<p>The other is GWT.  The authors continually harp on about saving us from Javascript inconsistencies and cross browser compatibility.  And, to be honest, I think they have a very good point.  Anyone who has done serious web work would have run into cross browser problems.  There are some other benefits to GWT, such as moving client state down to the client, where it well and truly belongs.  Also the ability to pass real, proper Java objects (or at least <i>pretend</i> that is what you're doing) means GWT would never even notice most of the 'heavy lifting' that other frameworks keep rupturing their disks over - such as parsing form parameters, or having to post forms to the server to get them validated only to have to go back to the client and recreate the failed form...  (save yourself the round trip and a square headache).<p>Now, obviously I'm clueless, but to my untrained eye as a programmer the bits I'd need to put into a Lift app look similar in some respects to the JSP tag libraries.  E.g. they are trying to get you to do the programming in the html or xml.  The problem is that xml (or any of its bastard love-children) is absolutely awful for doing logic in, which  makes it deeply unsuited for that task.  The only JSP tag library that I remember being worth mucking around with was some sort of super-duper-table-thingy.<p>Oh sure, you might not need to use weird variants on tags like <h:form> or <f:u:form> or <z:button> or whatever it was, but is moving the weirdness from the tag into the style/class really that big of an improvement?  It is still doing the programming in the wrong place, that is, in the html.",1295619374

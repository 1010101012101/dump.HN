IMHO the web's rise as the main application was as responsible to Apple's comeback as anything, eroding Windows' software range advantage.<p>2.

731655,comment,730755,731349,0,0,nocman,,,"I'll second that.  I have a relative who can stand fine, but can't walk for long distances.  The Segway makes it possible for him to travel distances that he otherwise would not be able to travel.  He doesn't look like a dork when he rides it (in my opinion).  Perhaps everyone just assumes that if you own a segway you are a pompous windbag with more money than sense.  I wouldn't be surprised if most people see it as a luxury item that only the ""elite"" can afford, and therefore they resent the device's presence (as well as the rider's).  Perhaps calling the person lazy is the best thing they can come up with which is derogatory.  ""Get that thing off the sidewalk you rich jerk"" probably doesn't seem to have as much sting.",1248925451

When I (and I'd suspect lots of others) click a link, I'd like to be taken directly to that resource.<p>In fact, a day or two back there was a story posted to HN that went to a kiw.is link. My gut reaction was, ""WTF, where's the article. Oh there it is. Wait?! That was a 3rd party interstitial? Whoever submitted that link is a jerk and a half.""<p>So I guess what it boils down to is that I believe anyone who knowingly inserts an interstitial that could otherwise be avoided is a jerk and a half.

I don't mean by that that they necessarily know they're being tricked and consciously ""undo"" the trick, but they are then trained to handle a tougher constraint, and thus are able to routinely do something they could not before, out of pure training. The whole danger/constraint/learning system is actually very elastic. The net result is that not only they end up driving at the same speed as before in the modified area, they actually drive faster than before in the other non-modified areas.",1315915178

2990976,comment,2990405,2990405,10,0,michaelochurch,,,"I think it's possible to work 60 hours per week productively. In order to do so, you need not only passion but a proper life setup. At least, it's important to have diversity not only in the work (more than one project) but in work environments. I would shrivel up and die if I had to spend 12 hours straight in an office building, especially in the winter when the days are short and 30-60 minutes/day of daylight outside time (yes, even when it's 25 F) is a mental-health necessity.<p>The issue with work hours is that most people work 55-60 hours per week including housework, commuting, in-office time, communication and lunches. That's a normal total (paid and unpaid) work week and it doesn't usually lead to burn out. (Yes, I count lunch as ""work"": there are usually social expectations that make it a lightweight form of networking.) The danger of pushing to 60 hours of ""work time"" is that the real work week becomes 75-85 hours, a level that's not sustainably productive for anyone. Personal errands go undone, housework falls behind, and these ""time debts"" pile up until they're unmanageable.<p>If you're going to work more than 40 hours per week, you have to outsource the housework. If you're doing your own cleaning and working six 10-hour days, you're destined for burnout. Car commutes, as well, are deadly. Sitting in traffic can incinerate 5-10 hours per week easily. The solution (if available) is either to get some of that work done on public transit, or replace the boring, stressful car commute with a bike commute, getting physical exercise on the way.<p>Also important is attention paid to the fact that burnout (and avoidance thereof) are not only functions of how much one works, but what one is doing outside of work. Physical exercise, keeping up friendships, leisure reading, travel, variety of cuisine, and some sort of spiritual focus (this needs not be tied to supernatural belief) are essential in order to keep perspective. <i>Not</i> doing these things, even at a 20-hour work week, is going to produce burnout over time.",1315914500

I have a project I've collaborated on for more than a year and it would be incredibly difficult to give up on it before it is in any kind of finished state. Meanwhile, other opportunities have come along that I couldn't pass up. I know that rationally the best thing to do is to prioritize and cut down my commitments, but I also want to see things through because I would like to see the project live and because I hate giving up. I am also irrationally averse to screwing over the other people involved. I know I can't possibly work this much effectively but part of me still refuses to admit it. I had plenty of time to test my limits in school and get myself into mental and emotional disasters because of that. I don't want it to happen again.",1315914498

</code></pre>
No way - it's a strength, so much so that I think you're getting downvotes because saying otherwise reads like a troll. Maybe you can support your position better.<p>Code that is battled-tested by millions of hours of runtime is extremely valuable. Consider protocol code. Or processor-optimised assembly language that has backwards compatibility and which hardware manufacturers have developed against.<p>Microsoft is a great example of a company that has been far too ready to rewrite. They could have had happier consumers for far less effort, and be in a better strategic position now if they'd followed a conservative OS strategy and tried to preserve NT and leveraged virtualisation to get the feature and security advances they needed. There was precedent for this (IBM VM) and they had experience with that kind of thing with their OS/2 v2 exposure (win32s API ran on OS/2 v2, and OS/2 1.x stuff ran on NT4), which isn't to say they would have needed to exactly mirror either of those approaches.<p>Even with near-infinite resources at their disposal they have struggled with the pace of change they've put Windows through, and significantly alienated the customer base in the process.",1315913637

My thoughts:<p>On Unity: The fact is, Canonical cannot possibly satisfy every single Ubuntu user with a single interface. They will alienate some users and acquire others with their changes. In the end, I think Unity is a good development for the Linux community as a whole as it will probably attract many users to Linux who wouldn't normally have been. The ones who really know what they want will find a way to get around it one way or another (that is a sort of universal constant in geeks).<p>I can also see why they are unwilling to provide a simple option to allow both Unity and GNOME2 (in future releases I mean). Having a single codebase for a desktop environment will probably allow them to focus on real usability issues rather than compatibility ones (and whether the usability suits us hardcore geeks or not, I suspect Canonical does usability testing on these interfaces before introducing major changes. Can anyone corroborate this?). Overall, I think it's good. I have friends who would never have touched Linux with a 10 foot pole who are now loving Ubuntu with Unity (and more importantly, the ideas and community behind it).<p>On general stability: I think the Ubuntu team is doing a better job than most can possibly hope for. There are bugs and they will take time to fix. I suspect the priorities of these bugs is different for Ubuntu developers and for us here on HN, thus the complaints.

But enforcing 3 slides per presentation is ridiculous.<p>A presentation should be balanced between content and visuals. Content should be presented in a manner supported by visuals. You liked the graph because it was essential and supporting the information being transmitted to you.<p>Also, filling a presentation with unnecessary information and talk would turn the audience off and bore them.<p>So stopping and thinking before doing any writing down or creating any slides is good behaviour leading good presentations.",1315912066

2990860,comment,2990571,2990623,8,0,lloeki,,,"> <i>It's fine for presentations at conferences</i><p>Even then, the approach taken by Lawrence Lessig (hundreds of slides, very rythmic), makes the point across. Yet the slides alone are worth nothing without the presenter.<p>The biggest mistake is to think that the slides contain the message, a mistake often shared both by the presenter and the audience. How many times have I heard ""can we get a copy of those slides?"". If I ever hear this question it means I have failed as a presenter.<p>It's useless and missing the point to ask for the slides. Slides are not the vector of the argument, you  the presenter  are; Slides are merely here to outline the point.<p>Nobody reads the bullets <i>and</i> listen to you at the same time. Nobody will read those tables projected on that small screen at a jittery resolution. It could be bogus data and no one would care yet their mind will focus on it instead of what you say. You built a table to compute a total, so only the total matters. Guess what? Just show the total. Your discourse will expose what the bullets say, your discourse will sum up what's in the tables. Then you nail it by showing the total slide. If people do want the table to check values then its place is not in the slides, it's in a report. A document with <i>content</i> that you hopefully provide when it matters. Slides on the opposite should basically have a very low content ratio in contrast with your speech, or people will simply be distracted from you and read. Worse, they will unconsciously  wonder why they're here listening to you when they could just as well read the content by themselves, and end up getting bored.",1315911825

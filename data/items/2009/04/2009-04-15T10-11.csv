563270,comment,563113,563140,0,0,troels,,,"You would never have to filter a password. In general, you shouldn't rely on filtering, but rather on escaping. Escaping always work, whereas filtering can have subtle edge cases. The only place where you should resort to filtering, is when you (for some reason) need to display input <i>as code</i>. But it's important to stress that filtering is <i>less</i> safe than escaping - it's not the other way around. That's counter-intuitive, so a lot of people get it wrong.",1239793146

563263,comment,562014,562049,0,0,Jem,,,"I made a similar mistake in a job interview once. I was interviewing for a position as IT technician, and the network manager asked me where I wanted to be in 5 years time. I responded ""in your job"".<p>It didn't go down well, and although I explained that I meant ""in a position of responsibility such as that of network manager"" rather than replacing him in his <i>actual</i> job, we never did get on. Although I got the job, I was forced to quit just over 3 months later because I couldn't stand the tension.<p>It turned out that he was an asshole to everyone, but I have a feeling I marked my cards somewhat.",1239792464

563259,comment,563190,563190,0,0,derefr,,,"Sadly, Firefox 2 isn't dead (and apparently still accounts for 40% of Firefox usage), so inline-block is even further-away than the death of IE6. I recently had to take out a bundle of inline-blocks I had put in for a client's intranet site after finding out that they wouldn't even consider updating past 2.0.0.20. Why go through the major effort of transitioning to a new browser and then doing QA and testing for all your existing web-apps, but then not put in the small amount of effort involved in keeping said browser up-to-date? I've never seen a single site, no matter how complex, break on a Firefox upgrade.",1239792216

563235,comment,560896,561277,0,0,BSousa,,,"Maybe I have a different idea of defensive programming. But for me, defensing programming is making sure that when you call a method (or something else) the data is assumed to be good or else it will go KABOOM. This is for example asserting for all the arguments that should exist and not for if (something) return;<p>For example, if I call a Draw method on an object, I assert if the object Color property hasn't been set. I don't create a default color for it. This makes sure that the Draw will work as it should, it will make no assumptions on how it is being called it just makes sure that when it was called it will have to be valid.",1239789891

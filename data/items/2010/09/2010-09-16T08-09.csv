In the real world they are often used in an anti-REST way, specified in advance instead of linked via hypermedia. If the client needs to use foreknowledge to construct URI strings, that goes against everything REST stands for.<p>REST is <i>Hypertext As The Engine Of Application State</i> — the default modus of ActionController::Routing::Routes has nothing to do with it.<p>A design that uses only opaque UUIDs as names for resources and reveals them to the client via links in the responses is perfect REST. Clean-looking URIs are a distraction, except that they tend to be easier to preserve across software rewrites.",1284627478

It has to be monolithic to be multi-platform, and it has to be multi-platform to serve as a life-support system for all the iConsumerElectronics on Windows.<p>If iTunes was OSX-only, it could spray itself all around OSX as a bunch of cute one-screen utilities with clever integration hooks:<p>1. The App Store would become part of Software Update (which would thus become a general Mac App Store and App Update manager—hopefully buying out AppFresh and giving MacPorts a GUI);<p>2. Contacts, Bookmarks, Notes, etc., and the transfer of media to the iConsumerElectronics in a friendly, GUIful manner, would all be a part of the iSync utility (yes, that exists—it's the ghetto for synching phones that aren't made by Apple);<p>3. Podcasts would just be a client program that relies on the same background-downloading daemon that System Updates do, with a modification to read arbitrary feeds, and extract enclosed media files (or torrents!); once downloaded, iSync would just see them and sync them;<p>4. iTMS would just be a website, which would expose special content types that Safari would know what to do with (audio/x-apple-ringtone = save to the Music/Ringtones folder, etc.);<p>5. and iTunes would be left to be a music library, consisting in its entirety of Playlists, Genius, and perhaps the Radio (and hooks to send events to Ping, if it likes.)<p>If iTunes was OSX-only, it wouldn't need to know how to burn CDs; it could just allow you to export a playlist as a folder of MP3s, and then integrate audio-CD burning as an option in the OSX Burn Folder menu.<p>If iTunes was OSX-only, it wouldn't need to have sections for TV Shows, Movies, Books, Ringtones; those would just be folders on your hard drive, which iTMS (through Safari) would write to, and iSync would read from.<p>There's a thousand other ways it could be better and slimmer—but, if you'll notice, none of these things could work given the restriction that they have to work on Windows as well.",1284627410

But within most of the rest of Judeo-Christian history and tradition (including most modern Jewish and Christian intellectuals), faith has been thought of in the way I described it: the triumph of reason and experience and willpower, in opposition to fickleness and forgetfulness and emotion.<p>The only ancient <i>mysticism</i> I know of surrounding Jewish or Christian ideas of faith is the idea that a person might have a supernaturally strong will, and therefore may be able to continue acting according to reason through remarkably dire circumstances.  The concept of faith itself, within those traditions, is not mystical or supernatural.<p>Kant's <i>morality</i> has mystical aspects, and therefore, by association, so does his <i>faith</i> -- as I said, it was a step toward the modern definition (and it may very well be flawed.)  Ayn Rand's definition is particularly 20th-century influenced: <i>""blind acceptance of a certain ideational content, acceptance induced by feeling in the absence of evidence or proof.""</i>  You will not find this mystical, blind conception of faith prior to about a hundred years ago; it is not what was meant by Kant, Augustine, Paul, or Moses.",1284627056

If they don't then look to see how much work they will require in custom development.  If you can easily do something with existing scripts then I would think the savings in time and getting to selling as fast as possible would be best.<p>If you start to outgrow your first CMS based solution then you could always build something totally custom with something like CodeIgniter while your store is still making sales.  You might even be able to take the time to learn Python and Django in exploring other options.<p>If nothing you find will work, then go with CodeIgniter (though Drupal is also somewhat of a framework and you could build a cart as a custom add-on) so that you can get to sales as fast as possible.",1284626970

1697255,comment,1695794,1696639,0,0,kleiba,,,"Interestingly, I often experience a somewhat opposite effect.<p>A lot of interactions with clerks are template-based, i.e., they follow the exact same flow every time. In case of McDonald's, the standard interaction for buying a burger may go roughly like this:<p><pre><code>    Customer: A big mac, please.
    Clerk: Would you like some french fries with that?
    Customer: No, thank you.
    Clerk: Would you like a soft drink with your burger?
    Customer: No, thank you.
    Clerk: For here or to go?
    Customer: To go, please.
</code></pre>
However, I found that I can't shortcut this conversation even if I give all the required information right at the beginning, which annoys me quite a bit. The interaction would then go something like this:<p><pre><code>    Customer: A big mac, please, no french fries or drink, to go.
    Clerk: Would you like some french fries with that?
    Customer: *sigh* - No, thank you.
    Clerk: Would you like a soft drink with your burger?
    Customer: No, thank you.

Further, you should concede that even if they have the epiphany that you are not well placed to help them given your own situation. The thing you should do is to let Shelter know they exist and are calling for help. There absolutely are people skilled and with resources waiting to help them as and when they want to help themselves.<p>Of course, you could just ease your conscious and throw them some money and satisfy their transient need for a little hard cash... but you probably know what this is going to do, and do it once and you will be put in the position to have to do it again.",1284626752

The trick is that Android isn't actually open for all parties concerned, only for the integrator.  The integrator may then decide to <i>make</i> the resulting device open, but that is not a foregone conclusion, as proven by some of the devices beginning to appear on the market.  But that message isn't what is being marketed - people are being told that Android is 'open', by which they naturally understand that they can do what they want with their device.

So my impression(not having been around for that era) is that extensive tape mixes like the one in the video were primarily inspired by digital samplers; since at that time, samplers couldn't hold entire songs, tape splicing technique improved to allow the same concept to be used in a longer format. The move to computer-centric editing came with multitrack editing of entire songs(e.g. Pro Tools) which happened during the 1990s.",1284626687

They're never around for more than a week.<p>The couple you described falls squarely in the last category. They're going to hit you up for money and favors in a surprisingly escalating way. Twenty quid for a hostel leads to 60 quid for a prepaid cell phone to ""apply for jobs."" That turns into a new suit, etc. Meanwhile all that money goes straight to drugs or liquor.",1284624487

CIM (Customer Information Manager) lets you store customers' payment information on Authorizenet's servers, and charge it by reference at any time. A daily cron job checks which accounts have not been billed in over 30 days and issues the charges through the CIM API. It's not terribly complicated, and a lot easier than the type of setup you need to store credit card numbers yourself while complying with PCIDSS.<p>If you ever look at the ""subscription management as a service"" companies, avoid Recurly. Chargify and Spreedly seem alright, but having implemented recurring billing with CIM and PayPal a few times already, they don't save me anything worth paying for.",1284624265

I was actually exposed to designing with contracts through this text before I was ever exposed to Eiffel. And it's approach to teaching recursion was very gentle and practical. While SICP is great in ideas and prose, it is in some ways too abstract. HTDP is more grounded and covers those details that SICP assumed you'd have. No harm in reading both though.",1315115239

I was contemplating going to graduate school for a masters in physics but I decided against it.

This is a working product that's been rock-solid for the client. Still though, at one point, I really hated the code.<p>Nevertheless, I've been able to extend bits and bobs of it over the years without major headache or breakage. And tonight I had to write a simple related utility program. I was able to grab various classes out of the code and just use them, or re-purpose them with little effort.<p>Are there issues with the code? Hell yes. I'm always learning as a programmer and I'm much better now than I was then. Does that mean the code was crap? It feels kind of hard to say this, but no it wasn't crap. It did the job and it hasn't been a maintenance nightmare.<p>So when you look at code you wrote 6 years/months/weeks/days/hours/minutes ago and think, that's total crap! Don't beat yourself up over it. It just means that #1 you care and #2 you have learned something between then and now.<p>Oh, and after looking at the first line of nirvana's post, I thought about it and realized I wrote my first bits of code about 30 years ago too.",1315113335

It has become apparent that there is a lot of variability in the nighttime sky, and we now have the technical means to discover lots of new things.<p>One major factor in this change has been the advent of wide-angle surveys, that repeat often enough to find variable sources like SN's, blazars, asteroids, lensing events, etc., while they're still interesting.  The Palomar Transient Factory (<a href=""http://www.astro.caltech.edu/ptf/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.astro.caltech.edu/ptf/</a>) is the one mentioned in the article, but there are many others.

678252,comment,677473,677616,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"Well, the ""epistemic hand wringing"" has a very serious point, which is that it spells big trouble for philosophy of science, which is (among other things) concerned with the ""problem of demarcation"". Put simply: how do you tell what is and isn't ""science""?<p>Hume's formulation of the problem of induction actually pointed to two things: one, the ""logical"" problem of induction, was simply the standard critique of inductive generalization as an unsupportable method of inference. The other, the ""psychological"" problem of induction, claimed that inductive generalization was nonetheless how human beings actually think, and so we're screwed. But in the late nineteenth century, and then again in the mid-twentieth century, you get two thinkers who challenge this.<p>Charles Saunders Peirce took a view of science and of human thought which was not based on induction: in Peirce's view, the ""average"" person simply believes something until it causes some sort of conflict (at which point, Peirce claimed, other methods of justifying belief would be developed in response, leading to a chain which eventually ends up at the scientific method). Peirce also didn't view science as being able to give ultimately true answers to questions (thus sidestepping the need to justify inductive generalization, even if it does end up as part of scientific method); rather, science can get better and better approximations to the truth over time (as more observational data becomes available and new theories are proposed to explain the data), but will never actually arrive at ""the truth"" (and we wouldn't be able to tell even if it did). In other words, Peirce's view of human knowledge and of science is based around fallibility.<p>Karl Popper, immersed in the world of German-speaking philosophy, came to very similar conclusions much later on, and proposed a solution to the problem of induction in the following form. First, he accepted in its entirety the logical problem of induction, but declared that it need not cause problems for science, because science need not be inductive in nature. Second, he proposed that the psychological problem of induction was a fiction: he asserted that the way people actually reason is far closer to fallibilism (just like Peirce), and framed it in common-sense terms as a process of trial and error.<p>Popper built a theory of demarcation around flipping the problem of induction on its head: it is true, he happily conceded, that no number of observed instances is sufficient to establish a generalization to all instances (including those as-yet-unobserved, or unobservable). But this turns out not to be such a big deal, because all it takes is <i>one observed counterexample</i> to demonstrate that a theory is false. Thus we can still proceed scientifically, but instead of speaking of theories which are ""verified"" by observation, we speak of theories which survive attempts at falsification.<p>Popper came to the same sort of conclusion as Peirce regarding the ""truth"" of scientific theories: he felt that there was no useful distinction between, say, a ""hypothesis"" or ""conjecture"", and a ""theory"", because none of them can be said to be true -- the best that can be said is that they have not yet been proven false. And so he developed a system in which ""science"" consists of those theories which can be subjected to falsification: a theory is scientific only if there is some test which, if it gives a negative result, will be taken as showing that the theory is false.<p>He talked occasionally of this system as applying a form of Darwinian selection to theories: there is never a final ""best"" or ""true"" theory, but there is a selection process at work which eliminates false theories through observation of counterexamples. The theories which stay with us and form the basis of everyday working science, then, are not those which are ""true"" but are merely those which, so far, have survived that selection process. And in judging between competing theories, Popper preferred the theory which was boldest in terms of possible falsification: theories which make assertions that are easy to test for falsity, he claimed, tend also to be those which -- if they survive such tests -- provide the broadest and most useful basis for further scientific work.<p>Of course, both Peirce and Popper are terribly unfashionable in philosophy of science these days. Peirce is reviled for having the gall to claim that science advances <i>toward</i> truth over time even if it never <i>arrives</i> at truth (a position which every good postmodern Kuhnian disciple will dogmatically reject). And Popper is often viewed as a sort of semantic charlatan whose attempt to shift from verification to falsification was merely a critique (albeit a devastating one) of communism, Freudian psychology and logical positivism.",1246232496

678247,comment,677381,677665,0,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>it's a biochemical imbalance, not a psychological reaction</i><p>To call depression a ""chemical imbalance"" is what physicians, compassionately, tell their patients to encourage them to take their medicines. But the doses of lithium, the best evidenced drug for depression, that are in the therapeutic range are many times higher than the natural level of lithium that occurs in any healthy untreated human being, and perilously close to the toxic dose.<p>The current view is that depression strikes people who have a genetic vulnerability (that much would be either biochemical or structural, perhaps a different vulnerability in different patients) who also experience certain kinds of environmental stress (perhaps not always the same kinds of stress for all patients with the same underlying vulnerability). That medicines relieve depression--as some plainly do for many patients--doesn't prove that what the patients had beforehand was a lack of those medicines, or even exactly an imbalance of the brain chemicals most influenced by those medicines.

To the old bureaucrat it may mean marrying a woman, perhaps a white woman, or a Chinese woman. To the old bureaucrat it may mean that prodigy is a bad influence on youngsters, etcetera. In short, it is none of his business and what is his business our society has been deciding since it became a collective and it could not be simpler, if it harms anyone, or anyone's property, then sure regulate their behaviour, otherwise leave society to deal with pressuring into confirmation when it comes to such issues as common human decency to have respect and empathy for the tragedy of an entire people.",1246230964

In other words, the fuel mixture may contain about 85% ethanol.  Their MPGe calculation probably only counts the gasoline in that mixture, the 15%.",1246230889

The set of such foods is a function of the environment in which the species has evolved.<p>All of these specializations/tradeoffs of an organism's design (fangs, intestinal tract length, stomach composition, etc.) are a function of the species' unique evolutionary environmental history, and should be viewed as optimizations over past environmental factors.<p>There is also the important factor of calorie scarcity as a driver of selection -- through  most of evolutionary time, simply getting enough calories was paramount for all species, including the human species.  Also note that there is significantly greater selection pressure for characteristics that facilitate survival through reproductive age even at the expense of overall longevity... so being able to eat (or even <i>craving</i>) a food that causes disease at age 60 historically offered a benefit well through the reproductive age and thus offered a net selection advantage.<p>So, if one takes the list of foods a species is capable of eating and <i>removes</i> the notion of calorie scarcity, one can determine which foods are <i>most optimal</i> for vitality and longevity...<p>Most of the arguments for why humans should eat meat, fats, etc., are based on the implicit assumption of calorie/nutrient scarcity.  Of course if you're stranded in the arctic it's a great idea to eat some seal blubber... and it makes sense from an evolutionary perspective to <i>crave</i> it or to enjoy the smell of cooking meat.<p>But when you're living in an advanced, rich society with essentially no calorie/nutrient scarcity, it becomes possible (and fun) to address the question of optimal nutrition.",1246230253

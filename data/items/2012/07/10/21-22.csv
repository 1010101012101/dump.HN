After that PC hardware outpaces them, and the only advantage is that it's easier to use and it sits in your living room. Look at the Wii, it wasn't anywhere near PC level hardware even when it came out. In fact the next gen of consoles won't really be faster than top of the line PCs even when they debut.<p>The developer is arguing that the advantage consoles have is TV access (easy TV access). So she's looking to combine the TV access of a console with the ease of development of a PC. And it looks like there is a sizable number of people who agree with her.<p>Look at the sales so far. 10k units presold in a few hours, the X-box 360 only sold 300k units its first month in North America, and that was with a huge advertising campaign and an actual product on store shelves.<p>They also don't need to beat x-box, I'd wager that almost anyone who would buy this will buy it in addition to X-box.<p>From the results, clearly there's a market here.<p>>Indie games generally also have the advantage of being very easy to port, especially if you use SDL for the graphics.<p>Why wait for the game to be ported when this thing is only $99.<p>>Just being slightly cheaper<p>It's <i>half</i> the price of the cheapest 360, and there's no xbox live subscription fee. The average game price will be much cheaper as well.<p>The other thing I think you're missing, is that most of the I know <i>run out</i> of games to play. If this thing is just provided 10% extra content over what they have now, they'd spend $99.",1341957595

In this case, the peptide recognized prostate-specific membrane antigen, which is expressed on prostate cancer cells, and the cytotoxic drug was one derived from <i>Thapsia garganica</i>, the toxic weed (cytotoxic drugs being isolated from plants is nothing new, of course).<p>A more common class of these conjugated therapies are called antibody-drug conjugates[1], where an antibody molecule (instead of a peptide) is linked to a cytotoxic drug. There is currently one of these drugs, Brentuximab vedotin, FDA-approved for the treatment of cancer[2]. There are many more under preclinical or clinical development.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody-drug_conjugate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody-drug_conjugate</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brentuximab_vedotin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brentuximab_vedotin</a>",1341957496

For example, we now know that dumping of heat and CO2 into the oceans is a bigger effect than originally modeled.  In other words, thinking about the big picture, things are worse than was thought (because it means measures like putting up giant sky-mirrors aren't going to reverse committed warming as easily as they might).<p>Ultimately, he advocates technological fixes.

4226435,comment,4224873,4226129,17,0,intended,,,"This is one of those questions where a rebuttal and an explanation would be extremely long, and would also have to work against your biases/beliefs. I hope someone more eloquent than me comes along.<p>In short it's a complicated matter, with tough constraints.<p>For one, yes banks do concentrate wealth a lot more than Facebook and google. HFT/prop desks/Cdo desks and the firms PE and IB arms are extremely well paid. They concentrate wealth very effectively.<p>They are doing something wrong, and from the emails which have come out its clear that the extent of it is literally unbelievable. As in the wrongdoing is so obvious, that people can't believe it's happening and move on.<p>I cant offer you too many links, because I don't keep a list of all the evidence the banks churn out, but the recent libor trader emails are a great start. You can follow that up by reading about the magnetar trade, or abacus - where Goldman Sachs sold their customers a CDO all the while shorting it because they knew it sucked. Edit: After that the emails where they forged ownership documents of mortgages would be illuminating.<p>The mechanisms are failing us, and the financial industry is extremely good at dancing on the edge of the words, but completely outside of the spirit of regulation.<p>Further regulation has been reduced, most notably glass steagal in 1999. We are actually seeing the crisis because of a proliferation of financial institutions and instruments caused directly by deregulation. Which is exactly what you are asking for. (edit: this also brings us to the edge of what we can discuss in general terms - you could mean deregulating so that we get a 100 bank of America's)<p>At the same time the regulators have been understaffed and weakened, so malicious actions are easier to get away with.<p>On top of all this, there is a chasm of understanding between a lay person and the rituals of wall street.<p>It was news to me that if the sec says its going to take a bank to court, it means the banks usually will settle.<p>The sec has few resources, so they choose cases where they know they can make an impact and not waste effort/respirces. when they do tell someone they are in their cross hairs, it's enough for people to realize ""ok, we better dial it down"". If they say they will take you to court, it translates as ""the sec knows they have evidence against you, likely sufficient to get a judgement""<p>To this most banks immediately plea bargain so that they pay a fine, take measures to correct it, and importantly - don't have to publicly admit to wrongdoing.<p>Banks work very hard to make sure they don't have to say they broke the law.<p>Only Goldman recently was arrogant enough to fight the sec and they lost. It was one of th largest fines in the sec's history, and yet it was a drop in the ocean for GS.<p>This matters because wall street is treated and reported in the main stream press using normal language. The reality of what's going on if translated better is hair raising.<p>As people are commenting ""anyone with a Bloomberg terminal in 2006, knew that libor was being manipulated""<p>Edit: honestly once you talk to a few traders or just keep up to date with finance news it starts becoming revolting. Many things are open secrets but are artfully reasoned away each day.<p>Also, banks is a huge term for what they do.",1341957359

However, We're looking at 90% fatality rates to get to that point due to lack of food production. Probably would be even less than that. No chance in happening, unless forced by catastrophic event.<p>Another possibility is tremendous rationing. We see what having even simple healthcare is in this country. Instead, we would look at rationing everything in the world, including determining who lives and dies by how much resources they use (carbon debt). With 2 high input/output countries, good luck on this happening either.<p>And we have to look at all the smaller ways to handle global warming. One proposal is to dump megatonnes of lime in the ocean?! Or perhaps this carbon credits scam: it makes the rich richer (Well, where DOES the money go?). At least sources of energy like solar or wind make sense... Until you realise the amount of energy to make a solar panel is greater than the total energy you will get out of it. Bummer.<p>And underlying is this assumption that global warming == CO2 peak.. I've heard of this law called thermodynamics. CO2 may trap heat, but heat generated anywhere is still heat. We generate heat via our vehicles, electric grid, generators, burn piles, and other human sources of heat. Is this not a direct consideration as well?",1341957282

Hell, in a more-perfect universe, I'd like to get an exception even if I pass 2/2 to parseInt with a radix of 19.<p>I can thereby totally feel for the argument that parseInt should throw an exception (maybe return null) if the string does not represent an integer. However, I continue to find it a stretch to claim that that is bad <i>language</i> design... maybe bad <i>library</i> design, but again that is how that function works in most languages.<p>From a language design perspective, the problem is either 1) that this function (parseInt) made sense to have been written at all, 2) that this block of code using it was allowed to be executed in the first place, or 3) that the developer was led to believe, based on other language constructs, that this was sufficiently reasonable to be typed by a developer.<p>Looking at it in this light, some languages are even well-enough designed to allow a function with the semantics of parseInt to exist and yet not allow this call at compile time: the fact that we have to wait until runtime to figure out that this code is wrong is then arguably ""bad language design"" (although, of course, has other interesting tradeoffs that people sometimes prefer).<p>This notion of ""choose the language feature that best disuades this entire class of error"" appeal is therefore why, were we to have a time machine to change JavaScript before it got entrenched, I would go with #5 (refusing to cast from a number to a string, and preferably also adding a dedicated string concatenation operator).<p>The key advantage is that #5 is a language change that fundamentally removes this kind of mistake from everywhere it could occur, while not adding a static type system or otherwise screwing with the set of data types (which would drastically change the overall character and abilities of the rest of the language ""JavaScript"").<p>(As an aside: I personally believe that the notion of ""string with specific semantics"" is something that can and should also be considered when designing type systems, but the ramifications of building something like <i>that</i> are more worthy of a PhD, or at least a Master's, thesis than a tiny post on a web forum. ;P)",1341956767

4226362,comment,4225651,4226249,11,0,bunderbunder,,,"I think the bigger thing to pull from that quote centers on the word ""prediction"".  The IPCC FAR didn't really make any predictions.  Instead, it made a series of <i>projections</i> (twelve of them, to be precise) based on running various sets of hypothetical parameters through a climate model.<p>Some of those projections were based on very pessimistic scenarios (very high CO2 sensitivity, very high future CO2 emissions).  They projected very high increase in temperature.  Other projections were based on more optimistic scenarios.  They projected a lower increase in temperature.<p>Now, the number that the author quotes (0.3C +/- 0.1C per decade) corresponds to the range for the block of projections that assumes a very high climate sensitivity - a sensitivity that turns out to be high.  Since the projection was based on a scenario that did not correspond to reality, if we assume that the models were reasonably accurate then it should not surprise us that the projection didn't end up corresponding to reality, either. So there's an interesting omission. . . and an example of how what someone doesn't say can say as much about their position as what they do say.<p>Another omission that speaks volumes is highlighted if you compare the projections for scenarios that ended up being more representative of how those parameters did evolve over the next two decades to what global temperatures have been doing over that time period. Far from the alarmist claims of gloom and doom that the author would like to suggest were made, the projection for the scenario that ended up most closely corresponding to what actually happened slightly <i>underestimated</i> the actual change in temperature.  But by an amount that was quite small in comparison to the error bars, so an honest and scientific analysis of the TAR projections would force us to conclude that in this particular respect the IPCC's analysis was actually dead on.<p>Poorly reasoned arguments are certainly unfortunate. . . but if you really want to make your position look bad, try blatantly cherry-picking the data.",1341956361

There is a vast difference between those and the banks in question. Banks should be run by accountants, doing boring accounting things, and being paid a fair wage for it. It should not be a license to extract trillions of dollars from taxpayers, without their consent or knowledge.<p>""Regardless, if banks are ""concentrating wealth"" they must be doing something right since after all, the ultimate purpose of a business is to make money. If they do so through illegal means (fraud, deception, etc.), we already have a legal system in place to deal with that.""<p>You're not grasping the situation or what actions have been taken in this example, and with the crisis and bailouts in the US. These are banks setting the rates at which governments borrow money, and the rates at which banks receive money to lend. Manipulation of those rates <i>is</i> illegal, unethical, and highly profitable. It's been abused on a monumental scale, so much so that it has begun to appear ""normal"" to the people participating in it. But, despite being the norm, it's fraud on a massive scale, and it destroys wealth and robs taxpayers.<p>I'm not at all arguing that more government/bank interaction is the solution. But, as long as banks have access to all the levers in our economy, and the ability to borrow money at rates they control and lend it out to governments at market rates (a free money funnel for taxpayer dollars), there needs to be regulation of those banks. If you can convince our government to remove that intimate connection between creating money (not wealth; we're taking about the currency that represents debts) and lending money and the rates at which banks borrow money being introduced into the economy (i.e. end or dramatically rethink the Federal Reserve in the US, and figure out a way to resolve the fraud in LIBOR in the UK, and whatever equivalent there is for the Euro), I'll sign right on for your cause. Independent currencies, like Bitcoin, are something I have high hopes for, but the Bitcoin economy is measured in millions...it'll be decades before we have an alternative economy and an ability to opt out of the horribly broken state currency markets and into a free market currency.<p>In the short term, laws need to be upheld, in London, in the US, in the world markets. People who have committed fraud worth billions or trillions of dollars need to go to jail. Just because someone is rich, well-educated, and doing what everybody else in their industry is doing, doesn't mean they should get a pass.",1341955504

How the simple graphic games can come out to be awesome, I mean we all played the classics right? Those 8-bit marathon games that gave us hours of joy, then hours more when they remade those games on the new system with the same old graphics, barely a remake in fact just a future port. And, I've sat as a gamer and watched all my friends buy those classic games over and over again, same graphics, same sound, same awesome gameplay.<p>So now we have this chance to get a lesser powered system out to nearly everyone, people that can't afford to game but wouldn't mind the hours of time and boredom that is swept away by even the most casual of games. (heard of Zuma? Plants v zombies? etc.)<p>I remember this morning seeing all the negative comments. It's 1:55 PM my time now,and OUYA is at 938,733 dollars. Clearly minutes away from being fully funded, with another 29 days they'll go over their asking by three to five times (if any of the kickstarters I've watched grow like this act as a valid indicator, which they should). So I'm left wondering, how many people will be eating the words they said today? I don't think it'll be OUYA, or any of the people that have backed the project already, waiting for the day that this console fills in a niche that the big console makers never even considered needing filled. I for one can't wait.<p>As of finishing this post, the project is fully funded at $953,325.",1341954108

A large part of the reason MMOs typically split the userbase into many shards is that the world design itself won't cope with the full userbase in a single instance of the world.  You need a lot more space, a lot more places where interactions happen, etc.  Imagine how much bigger the world of WoW would need to be to make the entire userbase work in a single world.<p>One of my favorite articles is on this very subject: <a href=""http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/114192/Opinion_Designing_a_Single_Server_MMORPG.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/114192/Opinion_Designing_...</a>",1341954045

Just being slightly cheaper won't really do it.<p>Most indie games don't really sell very well and the ones that do will be ported, Indie games generally also have the advantage of being very easy to port, especially if you use SDL for the graphics.<p>Plus anybody who's into really obscure Indie games probably has a PC already. The advantage AAA consoles have is that they can provide high end PC level graphics for much less money than a high end PC because the are subsidesed.<p>They might have more luck making something for the casual gaming market and consentrate on making an innovating controller that works well for exiting android touch screen games but can be used at a distance from the screen.",1341954026

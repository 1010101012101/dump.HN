No rational acquirer these days can expect founders to stick around very long. It may happen - YouTube guys stuck around - but the odds don't favor it.<p>Golden handcuffs and such only go so far, because if a person's mind is not fully engaged, what's the point in him or her showing up?<p>This has the effect of lowering the price acquirers would want to pay. I have seen this dynamic play out. When one of the companies I am involved with acquired a small company (note that most such deals are never publicly announced), they simply told the founders to stick around 3-6 months, hand over the technology and go. There was not even a <i>plan</i> to ask them to stick around. Of course, the price paid reflected that. This is the flip-side of the ""talent acquisition"" deals we read about - pure tech acquisitions, valued only for the code and the jump-start it gives someone else.",1288447179

You execute with the full force of your creative reserves that you've built up.  The more pent up you are - the more the ideas just pour through you as you write/code/compose - whatever.<p>And because the tap is open, eventually the waters on one side of the dam level out with those on the other.  The rate of creative execution slows down because it's not pent up.<p>But I think it's a mistake to say one is LESS creative.  You remain as creative as you ever were.

This removes payment processing, download costs and (critically) installation support and serial number issues hassles.<p>But that isn't really what you're paying Apple for. You're paying them for the creation of a new market that may (or may not) be better for you. Discovery (formerly marketing) is going to largely be their thing. Customer education will become standardized. Trust - they will teach people that apps are safe and hassle free to install & uninstall. They will teach consumers what an app is.<p>This will probably amount to far more then an increase/decrease in sales. It will determine which apps succeed and fail. These will be different from the winners and losers in the existing, ""natural"" market. It will determine aggregate demand for apps. This will also be different. It will affect consumers' expectation for what an app should be. For example, I think that learning curves will need to be reduced. The concept of learning software will be reduced.<p>A lot of existing software (the big names: MS Office, Adobe CS, etc come to mind immediately) probably won't fit into the app mold comfortably. Developers will have strong incentive to create apps that do. It will be interesting how much software can be ""apps.""",1288445995

I tend to believe that Ricardo's comparative advantage and similar economic principles established for more than 150 years are solid enough to be relied upon when dealing with a relatively large markets; I'd go with HilbertSpace about the global macroeconomic BS, however. I'm pretty sure that global markets are too complex to be described by any current model.<p>One point that particularly saddens me is the utter misunderstanding of growth by economists, because they go with the easy assumption first (GDP growth is a representative value), then with the oversimplification about the sources of growth, particularly the salient dependency of available cheap energy to sustain growth (see for instance <a href=""http://netenergy.theoildrum.com/node/7069#more"" rel=""nofollow"">http://netenergy.theoildrum.com/node/7069#more</a> ).<p>Then they generally proceed by forgetting that Adam Smith wrote his books in a time of immemorial non existent or extremely slow growth, which change radically the view.

It's really no more complex to incoporate bundling vs budget constraints and the time value of money into neoclassical economic models than it is to incorporate friction into a physical model. Appending ""<i>given no corresponding increase in supply</i>"" to a claim that the price of a commodity will rise given an increase in demand is really no more of a ""patch up"" than appending ""<i>given the absence of air resistance and other frictional forces</i>"" to a statement that the earth's gravitational field will cause a falling object to accelerate at approx 9.81ms^2. ""Demand"" being the level of quantity which would be purchased at a given price at a given point in time is as fundamental to microeconomics as the concept of <i>net</i> force to Newtonian classical mechanics.<p>Sure, a number of economists attach undue weight to some underlying assumptions which are only <i>partly</i> true, such as economic actors to some degree exhibiting ""economically rational"" (perhaps akin to a disciple Newton fan asserting the wave nature of matter has no meaningful implications for their bodies, this kind of abstraction is harmless when applied to sufficiently large numbers). But whilst this economic model appears to break down at levels as simple as individuals being ineffective at computing stochastic optimisations in their heads, it works rather well when analysing the behaviour of crowds. It's not so good at identifying when bubbles will burst, but then meteorologists can't predict the weather next year with any reasonable degree of accuracy either, and that's arguably a simpler system to model.<p>Where economists overstep the mark is not so much the tendency to oversimplify as the fusion of <i>normative</i> arguments with their models, such as the sleight of hand that dresses Pareto ""efficiency"" as a static optimisation problem rather than a rights claim made on behalf of the status quo.",1288445024

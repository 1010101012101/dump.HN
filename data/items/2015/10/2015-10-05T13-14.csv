Different frequency signals have different propagation characteristics and so only certain frequency ranges are amenable to specific use cases. For one, higher frequencies are more easily absorbed by materials, so you only get a few 100 MHz of frequencies suitable for long distance transmissions. As an example, even for home WiFi, you will note that 2.4GHz signals will travel farther in your home than 5GHz signals. With today&#x27;s tech, usable frequencies are a scarce resource.",1444053461

Or rather physical spectrum is a superset of licencable spectrum and already the physical spectrum only has so many quantum numbers to encode information in.<p>We can pretty much rule out orbital momentum encoding for satellite transmissions; the effects the atmosphere has on polarization are just too strong, for orbital momentum to survive to a degree, that it remains usable for consumer grade equipment.<p>That leaves as encodable quantum numbers:
- frequency
- amplitude
- polarization
- momentum (i.e. direction of propagation)<p>The band usable for radio satellite communication, i.e. able to pass through the atmosphere is rather narrow (compared with the whole EM spectrum): About between 100MHz up to 20GHz. That leaves you with a total usable bandwidth of about 19.9GHz.<p>Multiply that with the symbol density reachable through AM (under good conditions with a low noise floor you can encode about 5 to 6 bits). Polarization gives another bit. Spatial multiplexing gives you log2(n steerable directions) extra bits (usually not more than 4 beams you can control). Divide that by two, because existing transceiver systems (except for some lab systems) can&#x27;t do full duplex on a given channel.<p>If you multiply that up this gives you a theoretical limit of about 10TBit/s you can implement for a given satellite location (having several satellites in proximity means they have to share the spatial encoding bits).",1444053178

Most importantly I&#x27;ve found a single store/source of truth makes everything cleaner.

Not one per child but a pool for the school which are available to use in lesson time, exam time, and for the less well-off students to be borrowed for homework. Those that have their own Android tablet can just use their own and run the app on that, just needing a school one for exams (where they would not be allowed their own because they could bring notes into a closed-book exam).<p>For exam use they&#x27;d need to be locked down but that should be easy enough. Require that all students use a school provided one (so they can&#x27;t hide notes and other such on their own devices) and re-image each before the exams start (so yes, some admin time to factor in here) with a base OS plus the desired app and all wireless locked off.<p>I mentioned Android above for cheapness mainly, if you are going to target one platform then for this use the one you can get the least expensive units for should win. Having said that, you don&#x27;t need to go the native app route: build it in JS and you can run it on any device. For what the students will be needing even those cheap god-awful-slow tablets will cope quite nicely unless your JS and DOM manipulations are grossly inefficient. For the locked-down situation in an exam room &quot;run&quot; the app from local files and use the local storage options in the browser if you need to maintain state.<p>There would be an up-front cost (buying a job lot of tablets initially) and ongoing maintenance (a rolling program of replacing them as they break and some admin time updating/resetting them as needed) but you can get easily get 7&quot; tablets for less than $50 each as single units and that price should drop when buying in bulk. For a smaller device something like <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598272670/chip-the-worlds-first-9-computer/description"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598272670/chip-the-wor...</a> might be more suitable (smaller screen but easier to pocket and has physical keyboard) when they are available.<p>And of course the schools don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to provide them, if they already expect the students to have a TI calculator how is requiring them to have a cheap tablet or similar any different?<p>The key problems with this idea as I see it:<p>* Getting the new app-and-devices idea accepted as a viable alternative (the current graphing calculators are pretty entrenched).<p>* Writing the app in the first place, and then maintaining it. I doubt there would be a commercial impetus for anyone to do it so it would need to be some form of F/OSS arrangement or funded from education budgets. Maybe if I win the lottery and need a project to fill my spare time with I&#x27;ll give it a go...",1444050518

=====================<p>From: Larry Wall
Date: March 24, 2009 10:25
Subject: Re: Logo considerations<p>[...] I think there&#x27;s a tendency to
go way too abstract in most of these proposals.  I want something
with gut appeal on the order of Tux.  In particular I want a logo
for Perl 6 that is:<p><pre><code>    Fun
    Cool
    Cute
    Named
    Lively
    Punable
    Personal
    Concrete
    Symmetric
    Asymmetric
    Attractive
    Relational
    Metamorphic
    Decolorizable
    Shrinkable to textual icon
    Shrinkable to graphical icon
</code></pre>
In addition, you can extend just about anything by attaching &quot;P6&quot;
wings to it.  I also take it as a given that we want to discourage
misogyny in our community.  You of the masculine persuasion should
consider it an opportunity to show off your sensitive side.  :)<p>Hence, Camelia.<p>Larry",1444050314

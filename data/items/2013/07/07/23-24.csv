We didn&#x27;t have the most healthy job rate when times were good, let alone once the recession hit. I spent <i>five years</i> looking for a job- and didn&#x27;t find one until I got the help of a friend online in Claremore, Oklahoma, who let me move in. In a month I was working at an auto parts store, even though I knew jack shit about cars. I was making enough that I could&#x27;ve survived with that job. I&#x27;d be poor, I couldn&#x27;t go to college, but I could survive.<p>I was lucky enough that I had a nice computer I&#x27;d gotten from when there was a windfall in the family, and I&#x27;d taught myself to program enough Python and Django to get a webdev job remotely. But even if I hadn&#x27;t, I could&#x27;ve survived on this. Getting me out there cost a grand total of perhaps ~$1500, at most, and that&#x27;d get me my first month&#x27;s rent. Tack on another $1000 and I&#x27;d have 3 months rent total and enough leftover to get a cheap bed.<p>Is this economically feasible? Would it even provide good economic value? People are needed in these rural areas, but I just don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;d provide enough economic reward to actually be worth it to the country.",1373241599

Genetics shapes culture.  One of the interesting things from Mead&#x27;s &quot;research&quot; was that Samoan women were having a lot of premarital sex in the 1920&#x27;s.  Yet somehow none got pregnant but that was overlooked.<p>When you force people too far out of their natural roles, bad things happen.  There&#x27;s a whole lot more to this and its fascinating to see how people don&#x27;t realise it.<p>I respect that feminism is the moral case.  Genetics is the scientific one, which currently is not respected.  There&#x27;s a balance between the two",1373241578

6004178,comment,6003784,6003784,8,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Hmmm. I am beginning to believe any author who writes essays with the word &quot;capitalism&quot; in it neither understands capitalism or is able to work with the concept in the abstract. Usually it&#x27;s just regurgitated Marxist leftovers.<p>And let&#x27;s see what we have: &quot;A BI breaks with a fundamental principle of the welfare state. This, wrote Beveridge in 1942, is &quot;to make and keep men fit for service.*&quot; One function of the welfare state is to ensure that capital gets a big supply of labour, by making eligibity for unemployment benefit conditional upon seeking work. BI, however, breaks this principle.In its pure form, it allows folk to laze on the beach all day.&quot;<p>Okey dokey now. The welfare state is a product of the voters, not the result of one particular report in the 1940s in the United Kingdom. I can quite assure you that the voters were not interested in &quot;providing labour to capital&quot;. They were interested in being compassionate to their fellow man, just as they were in the States. The welfare state is a lot bigger than wartime England. If anything, the modern welfare nation has its roots in the late Victorian period, as large groups of people realized that they were being significantly mistreated by the system.<p>This is an important point, because if you miss it you miss the rest of it. The social safety net, as most voters understand it, is to provide a lift up to those in need, and some sort of permanent assistance to those who are incapable of leaving their present circumstances. This means that any welfare state has as its primary mission the determination of the difference between those who are temporarily downtrodden and those who will not work, either because of physical or attitudinal reasons. Voters feel differently about these different groups of people. Therefore the policies towards them are different.<p>&quot;capitalists, who want a large labour supply&quot; -- no, capitalists want to trade stuff. Sometimes, like in the 1800s, this required a large labour supply busy as beavers in the sweat shop making widgets. Sometimes nowadays it might involve really expensive robots and 5 laborers. Or 3 web programmers and some space on AWS. These old ideas of capital and labor are dead. Please let them rest in peace without digging them up so often.<p>Minimum wages and basic income policies all do the same thing -- raise the floor at which most folks can enter into productive trade with others. This raises prices and increases unemployment. These kinds of ideas sound great. Who wouldn&#x27;t want $25 per hour wages and guaranteed income for all? But all you&#x27;d end up with is $15 hamburgers and $34 gasoline. You don&#x27;t do anything but raise the table stakes for people, like certain homeless, just don&#x27;t want to participate in society. It increases poverty and suffering. Counter-intuitively, it does not make things better.<p>People need to pay special attention to those ideas which produce an emotional gut-feeling of &quot;hell yeah! Why haven&#x27;t we done that?&quot; There&#x27;s usually a really good reason that does not involve economic theories from the 1890s.",1373241298

Nobody wants to smell your feet, and even if your feet aren&#x27;t smelly, you&#x27;re at risk of developing a fungal infection, injury, etc. Wear some shoes.<p>The other aspect to picking a particular style or dress (let&#x27;s call it &quot;conservative dress&quot;) is that it makes people more comfortable.

In my experience, dressing more relaxed leads to more relaxed personalities, which has both great and horrible side-effects.

The result is a public market that is more and more just old, slow-growing companies.

Just the causality basis isn&#x27;t clearly SarbOx.<p>My current theory is the tilting of the king vs. cash towards king, as epitomized by Zuck. It&#x27;s possible that the market had started driving companies towards private control to emphasize long-term growth over short-term, quarterly stock performance, which drove the Enron-era scandals. The collapse of the tech bubble might have had an impact, too. I concur with Bilal that private audits are a more likely causal link than SarbOx, though that could be our mutual gov&#x27;t experience talking.<p>The JOBS Act created the IPO on-ramp (5 year SarbOx tapered exemption to reduce costs of public compliance), as well as 10x expanding the Reg A ($5M  $50M mini-offering cap) exemption to make it easier for startups to blend over into public exposure. However, these non-standard pathways are little known to both the investors that traditionally take early board seats and certainly early-stage founders. It&#x27;s also unclear how much of JOBS has even been implemented due to continuing backlogs from political obstruction of Dodd-Frank at the regulatory level.",1373240996

They just at the same time acknowledge that they could theoretically be wrong.<p>There&#x27;s nothing irrational with saying; &quot;Aliens did not build the Pyramids&quot;, or &quot;I know that aliens did not build the pyramids&quot;. It is assumed that a rational person acknowledges an infinitesimally small possibility that they are wrong in stating such a fact, but the reality is, all claims <i>whether negative (&quot;There is no conspiracy&quot;) or positive (&quot;There is a conspiracy&quot;)</i> are accepted by a rational person with such an acknowledgment of varying importance, so there&#x27;s no reason for a rational person to append every statement with &quot;but I could be wrong&quot;.<p>The crucial flaw I think that you (and the many, many others who have made such arguments) make is a fallacious distinction between positive and negative claims. \nLet&#x27;s take a positive claim like: &quot;There is a chair in the corner of the room&quot;. This claim, however, well supported by physical evidence (our rational subject has felt the chair, seen the chair, and seen others interact with the chair), can&#x27;t be known rationally with absolute certainty- of course, there&#x27;s always the possibility that some sufficiently advanced technology, conspiracy, mind-altering substance, or intelligent being is deceiving the rational subject, and there is no chair. This remote possibility <i>must</i> be acknowledged, but at the same time, it is dismissed by every rational agent, and rational agents do not base their actions on such possibilities. The point is, every positive claim like &quot;There is a chair&quot; can be framed as a negative claim like &quot;There is no force or phenomena deceiving me into believing there is a chair&quot;. Thus, if your suggestion that &quot;dismissing unsubstantiated negative claims is irrational&quot; is accurate, it would follow that you also cannot accept any positive claims without being irrational.<p>Rationality is having an open mind, accepting the most likely conclusion based on the available evidence, and properly estimating the degree to which you may be wrong. It works exactly like that for both positive and negative claims.<p>I hope you realize this isn&#x27;t just semantics. This difference is crucial in understanding why arguments like &quot;You don&#x27;t <i>know for certain</i> if there&#x27;s no God&quot; and &quot;You can&#x27;t prove there&#x27;s no conspiracy&quot; are flawed, and these arguments are actually used by irrational people to justify all kinds of nonsense.",1373238558

6003984,comment,6003267,6003267,6,0,Tichy,,,"I agree with his experiences, and there would be more to add. For example our baby-friend families usually were connected via my wife (from birth preparation classes for example), so it was a bit harder/more awkward for me to call them up to hang out so that our kids could play together. That&#x27;s not active discrimination, just stuff that happens.<p>I wanted to throw some other thought to HN: I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that we won&#x27;t see a big surge in &quot;stay-at-home-daddying&quot;. I have nothing against it, but ultimately I think the rationale would be &quot;why would I pay my babysitter half of my salary&quot; (which is what a stay at home dad is getting)? It seems to me a mother still has a bigger claim to her children because she invested much more physically, so society will deem it more acceptable if she does the stay-at-home thing, getting paid more than a mere babysitter.<p>Or will it become feasible in the future to speculate on becoming a stay-at-home dad? For example (extreme to make a point) instead of taking on another career, take classes in cooking and home decoration in the expectation to one day take care of a home? It seems very unlikely to me, although of course there will be (and already are) lots of women who have and want interesting careers. But would they go forth and marry a guy with no skills but home honing?\nPlease spare me the sexism comments, I want to think rationally about this. (I personally don&#x27;t care who stays at home). The point is that it is very viable to speculate on becoming a stay at home mother imo.",1373238211

6003979,comment,6003544,6003802,3,0,niveus,,,"Actually, the advice in this article is dangerous. While technically, you will burn muscle if you exercise at a high level for an extended period, this is because you aren&#x27;t getting enough calories to support your regimen. People are so afraid of calories nowadays, they don&#x27;t realize that your body needs carbs in order to perform work. The answer isn&#x27;t to eliminate cardio, which can boost your immune system and make you feel better overall (unlike what the article states). The answer is to change your diet to eliminate things like simple carbs and saturated fats. I&#x27;m under 10% body fat and I do both cardio and weight training and I feel better than I ever did in my 20s. Instead of simply taking my advice (or the idiot who wrote this article), read up on how your body&#x27;s metabolism works and how the different sources of calories are used for energy and repair. And, damnit, don&#x27;t be afraid of calories or cardio, focus on what you&#x27;re eating.",1373238133

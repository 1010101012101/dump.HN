Governments will demand it.""<p>I'm torn between thinking ""wow, that's scary"" & appreciating how much potential for good there is in a completely transparent world. I've been thinking about (genomic & medical) identity: research could benefit massively from a world of total transparency.<p>23andme is sitting on a growing collection of personal genomics data which they are trying to use for research purposes through their 23andwe program. That's great, but that is still a massive collection of data locked up in a single company.<p>Imagine a world where every single individual is sequenced at birth & his data is made publicly available for research purposes. Total transparency. Kind of the polar opposite of the current situation where the patient owns his data & permission needs to be gathered to use of that data for research purposes.<p>We're forgoing massive progress for fear of an artifact of current society (a.k.a. insurance companies).",1280998690

There are still a lot of places where having a degree is a requirement to get into the door.<p>Degree type:  For some places, having any degree would satisfy the requirement to walk in the door.  Some places may require a CS degree.  It all depends on who is doing the hiring, they can ask whatever they want.  Check job ads to get an idea.<p>Missing out:  You won't be missing out on anything you don't want to miss out on.  You don't need to take CS to learn the things a CS degree would teach you.  If you want to play with compilers, then play with compilers, you don't need to do that in a classroom.<p>Other Notes:  If you are close to being able to complete the degree, then it would be a shame to drop out.  However, some people were just never meant for school, and those people should recognize early that school is not for them and quit wasting the time and money.  If you aren't anywhere close, then it's a toss up.<p>Being forced into alternate options due to bad grades is unfortunate, but if you were to find yourself in a position where you couldn't even continue on the Mathematical Sciences track then you will have to make hard decisions.  Going into something such as business might not be a bad option if you could make that switch.  Otherwise, as you mentioned, you would likely have to find a different school for CS.<p>Important!  School is ultimately work.   You have to manage your time, your work load and be able to focus on many different tasks thrown at you.  You have to do much the same in the real world of work.<p>I had the same sort of problems in school as you are having, but I later found that those problems didn't go away when I left school.  I now face the same challenges daily as a web developer as I did in school.  Some projects are more fun and aren't as much of a problem.  Other projects are a lot of drudgery and I really have to force myself to work on them.  Had I known then what I know now, I would have either skipped school completely rather than waste the time and money or I would have done whatever it took to get through it just as I have to do with my work.<p>If you have what it takes to get through a large and complex development project, then you probably have what it takes to get through school.  In a perfect world, you shouldn't have to do anything that you aren't interested in, but life doesn't always turn out to be that perfect.  Do your best to identify the reasons you are doing terrible in school and try to figure out a way to defeat them as you will likely need those skills later in life.  Programming is a lot of finding solutions to problems, try applying that problem solving to school.<p>Good luck!",1280998071

This assumes one side is ""good"" and the other ""evil"".<p>Patriotism is well and good but it shouldn't interfere with clear thinking.<p>Why exactly should Assange take sides in this war or try to avoid setbacks to the US effort?<p>As to the fictional ""dirt poor farmer in Afghanistan"" scenario. Here is an alternate scenario.<p>I am a dirt poor farmer in Afghanistan. My  father fought in the Jihad against the evil Godless Russians and lost a leg and now I have to support him from my meagre poppy farm  - the product of which is bought for hard cash by the Taliban btw. When the Russians left (Glory be to Allah)  instead of establishing a government as sanctioned in the Holy Koran (remember I am illiterate and never read the Holy Book All I know is what the village mullah tells me)  warlords fought over my village, abducted and raped girls and young boys, taxed us mercilessly and made our lives hell. Then the Taliban came and enforced Islamic Rule and we had <i>relative</i> peace and justice. (The shadow courts of the Taliban <i>still</i> provide us Islamic justice  based on the Holy Quran and thh HAdith  as opposed to the corrupt Karzai government's ""courts"", whose judges hide behind American guns and where you can buy judgments in your favour if you are rich, and  whose writ doesn't run beyond Kabul anyway).<p>My son now fights for the Taliban against the evil  American invaders (whose drones blew up my cousin's wedding party and killed dozens of my relatives btw) just as my father fought against the evil Russian invaders. The Taliban are Afghani (and Islamic) patriots.<p>The Americans are invaders who have no business here. (Osama? Who Osama? oh you mean the great Islamic hero who struck a blow - I am fuzzy on the details, no cable TV in my village-  against the infidel West)<p>Of course I support the Taliban. You want me to be a traitor to my own people? Of course such people exist but they are all traitors and Allah's judgement will be on them soon enough.<p>More practically, the Americans will go back home in a year or two, just like the Russians did.  The Taliban will still be here.Karzai's writ (as long as the Taliban doesn't hang him from a lamp post like they did Najibullah)won't run beyond Kabul. And as long as the Pakistanis support the Taliban (with American money they say) the Taliban can never be defeated.<p>So when Habibullah, The shadow Taliban governor of my province asks me , ""What did the Americans say and do in your village?"" I tell him. Because someday NATO will be gone and the Taliban will rule and I can finally get around to growing something in the piss poor soil of my farm and get on with my life. At least they won't blow up any wedding parties looking for imaginary ""terrorists"" ""<p>So much for trying to explain the motives of people who live a world away and whom you've never met ;-). They  are easy to make for  each side of a conflict, depending on what your intended rhetorical effect is.<p>I could use your justification to defend the Russian invasion. If the welfare of <i>Afghans</i> (vs winning the cold war) was an American priority they should have just left Afghanistan alone. The Taliban were nurtured in Pakistani madrassas, armed by Americans and brainwashed by the Saudis. And now Pakistan is using them for its own ends and playing a double game with the Americans?   That was unexpected! ;-)<p>[1] I <i>personally</i> would  rather the Americans win than the Taliban. But then I am not an Afghan so I don't need to have any conflicts of loyalty.<p>In this non Afghan's opinion, a <i>successful</i>  American occupation is probably the better alternative in the long run for Afghanistan, as would probably have been the case if the Russians had ruled without being interfered with for a decade or two. But then I am a certified ""Islamophobe"" who'd rather see all religions wither and die, particularly Islam.  An (inevitable imo) Taliban victory would just empower the Islamic radicals and we in India would have another round of terrorist bombings and shootings as a result. But that can't be helped at this stage.<p>I (like much of the world) think the American effort is doomed to fail and President Obama (rightly imo) is just trying to redefine ""success"" and get out asap with some kind of face saving device - ideally the capture of Bin laden and/or Mullah Omar - which is probably where the focus should have been all along vs trying to rebuild Afghanistan as some kind of Jeffersonian democracy.<p>The idea that the American invasion is somehow for the benefit of the <i>Afghans</i> is hilarious and the apparent concern for <i>Afghan</i> informants by people of a  country that let its leadership declare two foolish wars is somewhat surreal. Hundreds of thousands of innocent people died due to American actions. Where was the outrage then?<p>And now Assange is the bad guy? Riiiight!",1280997618

For example, if you know your target site is using Rails (and if you've done Rails for more than two days you can describe the big freaking footprints most sites leave), you can identify at least one controller using action caching (look for the CMS, it is an obvious choice), write arbitrary Javascript into a cached page, and then figure out how to get someone logged into an admin account to visit that page on their site.  That shouldn't be too difficult (""Hey guys, you have a spelling mistake here, click this link to your own domain to see it."")  You now have the admin's account.<p>Action caching will vault over every built-in security measure Rails has to prevent script injection.<p>That is probably game over for most Rails applications, and all you need is <i>one</i> blind cache write to make it happen, since Rails will almost certainly give you everything you need to know in the URL to the probably-cached page (controller name, action name, object ID).<p>Happily, this is pretty easy to defend against: follow the directions that come with your memcached config file, particularly the one which says:<p><i># Specify which IP address to listen on... This parameter is one of the only security measures that memcached has, so make sure it's listening on a firewalled interface.</i>

As long as I can remember my teachers basically told me I underperformed grade wise for my intelligence. College has been no exception, and as it goes on things keep getting harder. Initially I was a computer science major, but my GPA turned out to be just barely too low so I have chosen to pursue a B.S. in mathematical sciences, which I figure is applicable in CS. I'm now in summer session to catch up and will be going into my 5th (I took some time off last year) year. I still have a serious uphill battle ahead of me before I get any degree at all. This is assuming they let me pursue the math degree.<p>Now, I am a good programmer. I have a great internship at a startup in the area which is really taking off (SaaS in RoR). I can best just about anyone who has actually graduated from the CS program at my school in an interview, and on the job, I just don't have the degree. I know a whole lot of good people in the industry, and I've got beaming recommendations from anyone who's ever seen me program.<p>I love everything about programming and it just makes sense, which is probably why I can spend some much time on it despite my concentration issues. I love to learn about new technologies, and how to solve the often intricate problems which present themselves in CS. Almost everything that I know is self taught, from about equal parts of reading and hacking around with things. I know I am good, and I want to be great, but every time I get my grades back I am discouraged.<p>What I am looking for is some advice. I know that a degree is an important thing to have in this day and age. Should I keep working towards a degree that I only partially want? Or should I try to go elsewhere (possibly a lesser school) to get the degree in CS? Would I be missing a lot of the fun stuff (like compilers and OSes) if I continue with the math degree? Is it possible to jump onto the computer science carrer path with the experience that I have? If so where should I begin? Should I ask the startup I'm working for if they would take me on full time?

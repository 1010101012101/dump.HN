To give you some insight into my behavior--I have an intuition about who is naughty or nice (maybe I&#x27;m Santa!), and I don&#x27;t spend any time on awful folks unless I&#x27;m learning from the experience. That means I can put more wood behind fewer arrows so to speak.<p>It absolutely seems creepy to read about my behavior, but I promise that with the people I reach out to, my batting average for them responding positively is probably around 0.600. I need to crunch those numbers--that&#x27;ll be a neat piece of data to use to demonstrate that I&#x27;m effective at communicating with new people, which means my fat butt is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold to companies who want to reach new clients and partners.<p>I think you might find that high touch sales is much more like what I&#x27;ve described above, than not. I love when someone treats me like I&#x27;ve described, because it demonstrates listening and understanding!

For the last 150 years, the economy has been based on man’s mind. Capitalism, it turns out, works better when people are chasing a carrot rather than being hit with a stick.

While I&#x27;m in a corp environment at the top of the market, VP&#x27;s have everything to lose and very little they can imagine that can get better (other than competitive catchup scenarios).<p>This leads to a really deadly cycle, where large companies shun real innovation because of the perceived risk being 100,000,000x higher than at a startup since one has 0 to lose, and the other has billions.<p>The net-net result here is that big corps never end up being first movers, since they need to see opportunity illustrated by a competitor before they move on it.

Take road traffic for example. Everytime I visit America I notice how much more efficient clean, distinct symbols are: Practically <i>everything</i> is conveyed by written out words &quot;Speed Limit&quot;, &quot;No Parking&quot;, &quot;No right turn on red&quot;, &quot;No U-Turns&quot; and so on. Such signs require, that I read and parse them. In fact, if one understands English it&#x27;s probably taking longer to recognize a sign, because several functional units in your brain try to take precedence on the interpretation.<p>In Europe we have very distinct symbols for each and every traffic regulation. The effect of this is that you can read them very quickly (it happens almost unconciously) and more importantly it even works if you glimpse them only in the periphery of your vision.",1450291910

The &quot;iPhone Dev Team&quot; was a group of five to ten people who built tools to jailbreak the phone and unlock the radio.

As near as I could tell at the time he worked in some capacity for a South American university. Geohot worked only on the baseband unlock and was forced out of the closed discussions when he released exploits before everyone had time to prepare.

Essentially, disagreement fosters creativity, not brainstorming platitudes like &#x27;there are no wrong ideas&#x27;.<p>An excerpt:<p><pre><code>    ...dissent stimulates new ideas because it encourages\n    us to engage more fully with the work of others and to\n    reassess our viewpoints. “There’s this Pollyannaish\n    notion that the most important thing to do when working\n    together is stay positive and get along, to not hurt\n    anyone’s feelings,” she says. “Well, that’s just wrong.\n    Maybe debate is going to be less pleasant, but it will\n    always be more productive. True creativity requires\n    some trade-offs.”\n</code></pre>\nThe article is terrific and I&#x27;m mentally made note of 3 techniques that I&#x27;ve used over the past few years:<p>1. Thinking on your own can lead to more solutions than thinking in a group.<p>2. Dissent and constraints stimulate creativity.<p>3. Insane, off-the-wall, unproductive ideas can stimulate creativity in everyone else.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/01/30/groupthink"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/01/30/groupthink</a>",1450291432

I was asked to rewrite it in Node.js.<p>Obviously, I&#x27;m not longer with that company, but still writing Node in the day job.

Or perhaps it can learn from examples of bicycles and sidewalks and driveways to do the right thing. The point is, there are millions of edge cases, so getting examples of them all for training or verification is a very large task. The alternative is to build a more general world model where it&#x27;s possible to work from the other direction and gain confidence that yes, the car senses all other obstacles correctly, and yes, it has algorithms that attempt to eliminate collisions in any circumstances.

I like your example with colors, which shows that there is a difference between seeing (i.e. experiencing) colors and producing symbols which give the impression that an entity can see colors.<p>I don&#x27;t follow any argument that proposed that computers can be conscious but other machines (e.g. car engines) cannot. In the end, symbols don&#x27;t really exist in physical reality - all that exists is physical &#x27;stuff&#x27; - atoms, electrons, photons etc. interacting with each other. So how can we say that one ball of stuff is conscious but another is not? And why isn&#x27;t all of the stuff together also conscious? Why not just admit we don&#x27;t know yet?<p>Consciousness may be hard to define, but lets take something simpler - experience, or even more specifically - pain. I can feel pain. While I can&#x27;t be 100% sure, I believe other humans feel pain as well. However I don&#x27;t believe my laptop has the capacity to feel pain, irrespective of how many times and in how many languages it can say &#x27;I feel pain&#x27;.<p>Perhaps the ability to experience is the defining  characteristic of consciousness?",1450289744

When steam shovels replaced humans, it&#x27;s not that only steam-shovel-makers had jobs anymore. Instead, new humans who would have been employed breaking rocks, were instead free to go invent or work in entirely new industries.<p>Entertainment, health care, and communications are industries that have exploded, in terms of economic value and employment, since the industrial revolution. One thing these industries have in common is that the value they provide is dependent on humans. People want to talk to people, see stories about people, and be healthy themselves. Technology enables these industries but technology does not replace the heart of the value.<p>Maybe someday if AI evolves into artifical persons, then AI could take part in conversations, be entertained, and wish to prevent it&#x27;s own death. But that is probably a long way off, and might never come. It&#x27;s not like people are working on artificial personalities now. No one is working on car AI that will tell its owner to fuck off, it&#x27;s watching Mad Men and doesn&#x27;t feel like driving.<p>The industrial approach to AI is to build better tools. Not to build new independent beings. Maybe it&#x27;s possible that a tool can become a being, but we have no evidence at all that such a thing can happen.<p>So the future of employment will probably not be unemployment, it will be different employment. Truck driver jobs will get replaced by truck-driving AI, but the children of truck drivers won&#x27;t miss it.

That point is tripping me up in these discussions.

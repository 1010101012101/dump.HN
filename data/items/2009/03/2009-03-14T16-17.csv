515957,comment,515749,515749,0,0,bokonist,,,"People tend to overestimate the value of newspaper journalism.  Paul Graham does a great job of exploding the myth of business journalism in his ""submarine"" essay.  Financial journalism has obviously been just as bad.<p>The worst, though, is political journalism.  Most ""journalism"" is simply writers being a conduit for leaks and bureaucratic turf wars.  Woodward and Bernstein did not uncover Watergate.   They were tools of one branch of power ( the FBI ) that wanted to strike against another branch ( the Nixon White House).  The crime was not discovered by journalists, but by illegal FBI surveillance.

515956,comment,515855,515855,0,0,Brushfire,,,"This is interesting. However, having been intimately acquainted with the mobile world, I'm a little skeptical.<p>1 - <i>month-to-month with no contracts or credit checks.</i>
This is the very same thing that caused the death of many of the MVNO's. Unfortunately, a lot of the people who really care about 'credit checks' are the very same people who dont tend to pay their bills. Collections costs money.<p>2 - There is no mention of SMS. Personally, I use SMS more than voice. SMS routing is a little trickier, and there are carrier interconnect agreements that they might be using, but I'm curious as to the cost structure. Also, its unlikely that, if they do have SMS, that it will be able to work on commercial SMS services anytime soon.<p>3 - I use VOIP for my business telephone lines. Even when you turn the call quality down to cell-phone-quality, things can still get choppy or jittery. This is over business grade DSL. I can only imagine the call quality and drops using any of the wireless carriers data networks.<p>4 - Lock-In / Trust. People are hesitant to switch to new carriers becuase of contract lock in, but also trust. I might switch from Verizon to AT&T or back (but never sprint, they are horrible). But will I switch to a noname provider? No. AT&T rollover is, for all intensive purposes, just like having unlimited.<p>I do really think the mobile VPN bypass is neat, but I'm not entirely sold their business can work in the long run.  Good luck to them.",1237049714

California would be the only state with legalization and would pull interested tourists from across the country.  Their market would effectively be the entire US with no legal means of competition for tax revenue.<p>The same thing happens with alcohol and cigarette taxation: a lot of people will cross state lines for the cheap smokes of NC or better alcohol of nearby states, if they are within proximity to the states border.  This effect is particularly noticable in driving across the country and having the chance to see the businesses that exist next to state lines selling these items.<p>Another similar situation is that of casinos.

Let me know what you think.<p>1.  Build a social news site for local stuff.  Gather an audience of local news junkies who like sharing, rating and discussing the best links from across the city.  This is a somewhat efficient way to generate pageviews and gather like-minded folks together.  Exhibit A: <a href=""http://www.windycitizen.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.windycitizen.com</a> the first local, social news site.<p>2.  When you find crazy power-users of your social news site who have specific passions for topics, create blogs for them and nurture their interest in writing about these niche subjects.  Exhibit B: <a href=""http://dailydaley.windycitizen.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dailydaley.windycitizen.com</a> a group blog written by a handful of our power users that posts a daily briefing on the mayor of Chicago's appearances, schedule, comments and coverage.  We have 40 more blogs where that came from, of varying quality but with some really good ones here and there <a href=""http://www.windycitizen.com/blogs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.windycitizen.com/blogs</a><p>3.  Team up with local hackers for the occasional special project that scorches the local sites.  Exhibit C: <a href=""http://election.windycitizen.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://election.windycitizen.com</a>, a rails app built by HN member collint<p>4.  When you feel the social news site is growing consistently and having an influence in the community, hire a part-time ad sales person to develop relationships with local businesses who want to reach your audience. Exhibit  B: The Craigslist ad I posted last week: <a href=""http://chicago.craigslist.org/chc/sls/1071989015.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chicago.craigslist.org/chc/sls/1071989015.html</a>  I've had 5 great resumes sent my way so far and am excited to put this piece of the plan into motion.<p>5. Once you get $300-400 dollars a week in profit coming in, you can afford to hire an honest-to-goodness pro journalist to cover whatever it is your community is interested in that week, scooping the dying local papers at least once a week.  If the story has national implications, you pitch it to Gawker, Politico and the HuffPo and rack up the backlinks and google mojo, making your social news aggregator even more powerful.<p>6.  Add more writers to your blogs, which are essentially open source journalism projects.  Some may grow to be powerful/influential in their own right, letting you sell more niche advertising or get direct donations.<p>7.  Get to the point where your front page links are driving 1,500-2,000 readers to the stories that make them (which would make you the most powerful traffic-supplier for local sites), your blogs are breaking news every now and then and doing a great job of covering ongoing stories a la TPM.  And your special reports, directed in part by the votes and story submissions of your users are setting the agenda in your community.<p>8. Repeat elsewhere.<p>Am curious to hear what folks think.  The limiting agent for us is always technical development.  We're using Drupal and I've learned that 9 out of 10 contributed modules either don't work or are so poorly-designed you'd never want to use them on a production site.  This has meant paying and begging friends for custom dev work and me having to learn a lot more Drupal than I want.  But that's the thing that I'm trying out here in Chicago.

BTW I know I don't comment here often, but I read you posts regularly and share your link's as well. Congrats, I have a feeling this is going to take off.",1237046923

Standing in front of a group of people with your attention fixed on a communication device is not good presentation. If it were glancing down at a clock sitting on a podium or table, that would be fine. This is not how it happens in practice. The biggest difference between a cell phone and a watch or other timepiece on a surface is that a cell phone requires interaction to extract the time. The extent of that interaction really doesn't matter. It goes from a momentary action of pulling a phone out and pressing a wake button to a nervous speaker confounded by a single button press and a screen too dim to see without making a spectacle of the action. This is the more common of the cell phone users I witness. The trouble is that every minute thing a speaker does is on display and just as a speaker expects (or hopes for) respect from the audience, I as an audience member expect the speaker to be attentive and professional.<p>So can it be done gracefully without my ire? Probably. I have yet to be pleasantly surprised.",1334279418

But I will say that I believe XML has a better ecosystem around it;  with things like XSD, XSLT, XQuery/XPath, etc., and some pretty easy to use data-binding frameworks like JAX-B.   My feeling is that XML makes it a lot easier to do certain classes of things that I want to do, like taking a business event message off a queue, match it against an XQuery expression, route it to the appropriate place based on that matching, store it in an XML database where I can later locate it using XQuery, and then render it into a web-based activity stream by applying an XSLT transform.<p>Sure, you could get there from here with JSON as well, but it sure seems more natural using XML.",1334279215

The tmux technical setup prior may have inhibited some developers out there.<p>The importance of remote pair programming seems to be slowly making its way to the forefront.  I've been toying with the idea of a high level protocol specifically for pair programming that would support the notification of high level programming tasks (switching tab, syncing file changes, showing highlights, cursor movement).   This protocol would be light enough that latency should be a mine issue.  It would have to be supported in all major editors (via a plugin?).  This supported would give each remote dev the freedom to work in their favorite editor with their own key bindings.<p>Here are some of my additional thoughts on the topic..

I took a look at the latest 1.* and 2.* version; they look to be using the libsrtp prng for their key generation, so it should be good.  The behaviour I was seeing was that the keys coming from the client I was testing with did not <i>ever</i> have any null characters in them, which lead me to believe the keys were only in the ascii range.  I'm not sure what type of freedom pjsip gives for key generation; maybe it was a problem with the client I was testing.  Looking over the pjsip code it looks to be ok (see generate_crypto_attr_value in trannsport_srtp.c to see the key generation using crypto_get_random).",1334278865

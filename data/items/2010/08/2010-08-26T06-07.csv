I had done decent and was in the top 1000 worldwide, but wanted to really see how I could do. I had the rest of the year in eligibility (it was June when I graduated, and you can play until the year you turned 19, which started the next January), so I packed my bags and played something like 25 tournaments that fall in a number of different countries.<p>I did poorly. I made it inside the top 650 or so, far from my goal or realizing any potential I thought I had. It seemed that I just didn't have quite the talent necessary to make it, nor do anything noteworthy with my tennis.<p>This was disheartening, but I had six more months before I would have to go off to college while keeping full eligibility, so it seemed like my best bet was to practice- with a new perspective that I didn't quite have years earlier.<p>So this time I got a private coach along with the normal academy practices. Every afternoon when everyone else was in school, we'd keep working. I figured that even though I wasn't a natural talent like some of those guys, a few hours' edge on them every day would help my case. My coach was great, super intense and helped push me when I was tired. I hit my physical capacity a few times and had to take a day or afternoon off every once in a while, but the fact that I was doing more than those supposedly untouchable <i>natural talents</i> was ACTUALLY working. I was noticeably better, a ""friggin' moose on the court"" as my coach would say, and I started really competing with and even beating some of the guys ranked in the top 100.<p>I think too few people really work very, very hard, which is what's required to make up for natural talent. This causes the huge amount of naysayers, who never see anyone with little talent exceed expectation. Because of that, too few of the untalented work hard. It's a vicious cycle.",1282804509

Don't let the excitement of talking to a VC lead to sharing information you'd prefer to keep confidential.<p>My advice is:<p>- Ask plenty of questions up front: what exactly is his interest, are they actively looking to invest in this space, what is their typical investment profile, who else are they talking to, how did they find you, what made them interested in you, and so forth.<p>- Keep it brief. Give enough to show you are serious and have real traction, but don't get overexcited and go overboard.<p>- Spend as much time showing why your team is worth investing in as you do showing off your business.

That would require as much engineering and quality control work as Apple, plus you'd have to market the hell out of it so that people understood why it was cool, and then, after all that, still sell the product for way less than Apple's because no one is going to pay an Apple price for a Dell product. No, the way to make money is by paying a couple devs to hack up something that looks really wiz-bang cool in demos with very little regard to the problem it solves.

Yet my experience is that a 100% increase in initial conversions typically results in approximately a 100% increase in sales.<p>My further experience from doing A/B testing for many years is that lots of people are eager to grab any numbers you give them, then run with them and form grand theories that aren't backed up by the actual statistics.  Those theories have a remarkably low success rate in explaining the results of the <i>next</i> A/B test you run.

True, I've learned to be cautious of attractively presented theories which aren't actually backed by data.  But it was definitely attractively presented.<p>However no evidence was offered that the people progressing in group A were actually significantly different than the people progressing in group B.  And if the test truly was letting crappier traffic through, and the crappiness of that traffic was the primary cause of trends in subsequent behavior, then that traffic has to be REALLY crappy to explain the difference.  Occam's razor says that random chance was the cause of the data, or at least a large enough contributor that there is no immediate need to think too hard about other possibilities.  And so until better data becomes available, I'm going to suggest that ""chance fluctuation"" deserves a hearing.<p>Medicine sometimes calls these zebras.  Why?

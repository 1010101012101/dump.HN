Being in Delaware provides them with more legal protection as investors and the C structure gives them more control. Some VCs will ask founders to restructure as C-Corps as a condition of investment, so pg recommends that Y Combinator startups just start out as C-Corps from the start (anticipating further investment).<p>If you're looking for VC money or major investment, it's probably a good idea.

244156,comment,244009,244009,0,0,sachinag,,,"At first glance, I wanted to say your lawyer is an idiot.  But then I took a deep breath and came to my senses.  He's not an idiot, but he doesn't know what a startup (in the HN/YC sense) is.  Most ""small businesses"" are never candidates for VC funding, etc.  A startup, in my mind, is different than a typical small biz precisely in that it is considered as a potential VC investment from the get-go.<p>Here's why you do a DE C-corp: it gives you the most flexibility and the most certainty of outcome.  Only C corps can have different classes of stock (a necessity for the preferred stock that VCs prefer), and DE is the best because they provide very wide latitude to management and have a great and well-understood corporate legal system with lots of caselaw.  This means that everyone knows what the rules of engagement are going in, and the judges in the Chancery Court (if it ever gets that far) know what they're doing.<p>An example: when I was in VC, we negotiated a term sheet with a non-DE C-corp.  The term sheet was accepted, and we drafted the amended and restated articles, investors rights agreement, blah blah.  But, when we filed the amended articles with the non-DE Secretary of State, the SOS office rejected them.  We had negotiated a voting structure that offended this state's rules for voting vis a vis ownership.  This held back closing for months, as we had to re-incorporate in DE, and tens of thousands extra in legal fees.  In DE, never would have been a problem.  And because in VC, almost everything is DE, it never occurred to us to think that the SOS office would reject the Articles.",1215819849

244136,comment,243920,243920,0,0,fallentimes,,,"Wow that story sounds familiar. I was out of school for two years working as a financial analyst before getting accepted in to YC this summer.<p>Right out of school and six months in to my job I knew I wasn't really cut out for finance and preferred to not work for someone else. I started a business on the side and learned more in 3 months than I did all through college. Fast forward a year. A childhood friend of mine and I began collaborating on an idea I had whenever we had spare time. However, we were eventually faced with a Catch22 situation: we needed more time to work on our startup, but we also needed money to live on (my other side business was making decent money, but not enough to live off of). We were OK with this and planned on doing the startup on the side until it was making money, or at least launched.<p>On a whim we applied to YC as we figured ""why the hell not?"" YC accepted us even though I was a non-technical. I'm not exactly sure why as I've never actually asked them, but I will offer some speculation: my partner is a genius and I was extremely familiar with the market we were trying to get in to.<p>Looking back, if we would have been rejected, I would have learned to code. Even now I plan on doing so (and have already done some) once things are a little less hectic. \nObviously, YC has sped up the creation process considerably and we've gotten more done in ~1.5 months than all the previous time combined.<p>So I guess my advice to you is this:\n1. Start a business on the side if you can\n2. Learn to hack\n3. Follow aaronblohowiak's advice\n4. Forget the mock business plans - I've run/ran 3 small to micro sized businesses and the closest thing I've done to completing a business plan is a YC Summer 08 application. At some point, you have to stop planning and start doing.<p>Good luck and feel free to email me anytime.",1215818899

244116,comment,243918,243954,0,0,schtog,,,"""During the twentieth century, thinkers such as Karl Popper and David Miller have disputed the existence, necessity and validity of any inductive reasoning, including probabilistic (Bayesian) reasoning[citation n""\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning</a><p>On the other hand E Yudkowsky claims Poppers philosophy is a subset of Bayes Theorem(or wait dont take my words for that I might have misinterpretad), here is the link and quote:\n<a href=""http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/bayes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/bayes.html</a><p>The Bayesian revolution in the sciences is fueled, not only by more and more cognitive scientists suddenly noticing that mental phenomena have Bayesian structure in them; not only by scientists in every field learning to judge their statistical methods by comparison with the Bayesian method; but also by the idea that science itself is a special case of Bayes' Theorem; experimental evidence is Bayesian evidence.  The Bayesian revolutionaries hold that when you perform an experiment and get evidence that ""confirms"" or ""disconfirms"" your theory, this confirmation and disconfirmation is governed by the Bayesian rules.  For example, you have to take into account, not only whether your theory predicts the phenomenon, but whether other possible explanations also predict the phenomenon.  Previously, the most popular philosophy of science was probably Karl Popper's falsificationism - this is the old philosophy that the Bayesian revolution is currently dethroning.  Karl Popper's idea that theories can be definitely falsified, but never definitely confirmed, is yet another special case of the Bayesian rules; if p(X|A) ~ 1 - if the theory makes a definite prediction - then observing ~X very strongly falsifies A.  On the other hand, if p(X|A) ~ 1,  and we observe X, this doesn't definitely confirm the theory; there might be some other condition B such that p(X|B) ~ 1, in which case observing X doesn't favor A over B.  For observing X to definitely confirm A, we would have to know, not that p(X|A) ~ 1, but that p(X|~A) ~ 0, which is something that we can't know because we can't range over all possible alternative explanations.  For example, when Einstein's theory of General Relativity toppled Newton's incredibly well-confirmed theory of gravity, it turned out that all of Newton's predictions were just a special case of Einstein's predictions.<p>You can even formalize Popper's philosophy mathematically.  The likelihood ratio for X, p(X|A)/p(X|~A), determines how much observing X slides the probability for A; the likelihood ratio is what says how strong X is as evidence.  Well, in your theory A, you can predict X with probability 1, if you like; but you can't control the denominator of the likelihood ratio, p(X|~A) - there will always be some alternative theories that also predict X, and while we go with the simplest theory that fits the current evidence, you may someday encounter some evidence that an alternative theory predicts but your theory does not.  That's the hidden gotcha that toppled Newton's theory of gravity.  So there's a limit on how much mileage you can get from successful predictions; there's a limit on how high the likelihood ratio goes for confirmatory evidence.<p>On the other hand, if you encounter some piece of evidence Y that is definitely not predicted by your theory, this is enormously strong evidence against your theory.  If p(Y|A) is infinitesimal, then the likelihood ratio will also be infinitesimal.  For example, if p(Y|A) is 0.0001%, and p(Y|~A) is 1%, then the likelihood ratio p(Y|A)/p(Y|~A) will be 1:10000.  -40 decibels of evidence!  Or flipping the likelihood ratio, if p(Y|A) is very small, then p(Y|~A)/p(Y|A) will be very large, meaning that observing Y greatly favors ~A over A.  Falsification is much stronger than confirmation.  This is a consequence of the earlier point that very strong evidence is not the product of a very high probability that A leads to X, but the product of a very low probability that not-A could have led to X.  This is the precise Bayesian rule that underlies the heuristic value of Popper's falsificationism.<p>Similarly, Popper's dictum that an idea must be falsifiable can be interpreted as a manifestation of the Bayesian conservation-of-probability rule; if a result X is positive evidence for the theory, then the result ~X would have disconfirmed the theory to some extent.  If you try to interpret both X and ~X as ""confirming"" the theory, the Bayesian rules say this is impossible!  To increase the probability of a theory you must expose it to tests that can potentially decrease its probability; this is not just a rule for detecting would-be cheaters in the social process of science, but a consequence of Bayesian probability theory.  On the other hand, Popper's idea that there is only falsification and no such thing as confirmation turns out to be incorrect.  Bayes' Theorem shows that falsification is very strong evidence compared to confirmation, but falsification is still probabilistic in nature; it is not governed by fundamentally different rules from confirmation, as Popper argued.<p>So we find that many phenomena in the cognitive sciences, plus the statistical methods used by scientists, plus the scientific method itself, are all turning out to be special cases of Bayes' Theorem.  Hence the Bayesian revolution.",1215817237

The way this is done is to make the oscillator's frequency dependent on the parameter you want to measure (normally a voltage) and the A/D conversion is done by measuring the osc. frequency. There are temperature sensors and accelerometers that provide output as a varying frequency so they can be fed straight into a digital input.I've been playing with a Maxim temperature sensor that works this way and it works really well.<p>Alternately, there is an old technique that generates a PWM-like output that is added with the signal-under-test (the thing you want to measure :-) and the output of that addition is monitored by an input pin. Measure the on vs. off time (PWM) at the input pin and you have a fairly accurate ADC. Low resolution, but it works.<p>But honestly, with so many precise, accurate and cheap ADCs available these days, doing conversions like this in software is relegated to designs where pennies are significant and the manufacturing costs dwarf the development time.",1233343545

It's great that the ""scratch your own itch"" has significantly reduced production costs, but consumption is important too.<p>Consider web search (which I'm not working on).  I think that search engines are technological marvels, but is the search box really the best possible interface?  I'm pretty sure that it isn't.<p>Consider Word/Outlook, two heavily used applications that ""provoke"" searches.  (That is, while folks do things in word/outlook, they often find themselves needing to do searches.)  The steps ""select, copy, paste into a search box"" are at least two steps too many, even if the search box is in the application (as it is in Excel).  (Yes, I'm aware of ""lazy search box"" - it's two steps.)<p>Moreover, when those steps are completed, they only get the searcher to a results page - said person still has to make use of the search result, which typically involves select/paste and the like.<p>At a bare minimum, applications should find reasonable search terms and provide shortcuts for using them.  Note that this alone can significantly improve search results because the document has information that can be used to improve said results.  (For example, the appropriate meaning of ""dolphin"" is usually unambiguous in the context of a given document.)<p>The next step is to make it easier for folks to use search results.  Google Spreadsheets allows one to ""link to"" data extracted from a web page, but is that sort of ""do it each time"" programmatic interface the best that we can do?<p>Instead, we're getting things like ""Enterprise search"" that give us the same clunky interface to internal information sources.<p>Yes, I know that the ""Semantic Web"" (and Xanadu before that) will to address these issues ""any day now"", so folks could more easily incorporate outside information, but search engines are way ahead in terms of finding and extracting meaning.",1233343417

You are basically making their job much easier...<p>If this site gets <i>at all</i> popular, domain squatters are going to scrape your site for domains that have <i>any value whatsoever</i> and register them.  That's how they operate.  They are set up to register domain names quickly and cheaply, and squeeze any profit from them at all.<p>For example, it used to be the case (might still be) that if you did a search on GoDaddy.com for some domain, and did not register that domain within X hours, GoDaddy would sell their searches to squatters which would then often register the domain you just searched for.  My guess is their whole process is automated based on how long the domain is, which dictionary words it contains, etc.  Shitty, right?<p>You are a dream come true to them:  more than just data on if the domain was searched, but actually tracking non-registered domains' popularities... and posting it for all the public to see!  All it takes is one of these self proclaimed ""web real estate guru"" assholes to come along and see your site has decent domain names listed, and tell his programmer crony to scrape and register them.<p>I see your only option being using images to display domain names, and mangling up the URLs, to hopefully stifle anyone trying to scrape your site.  Then, if you have a lack of morals and want money really bad, you can sell a feed of popular domains to squatters from some good money.<p>Good luck.",1233342701
458499,comment,457499,458368,0,0,trjordan,,,"First point: consider that if the only people that are smart and motivated have something to show for it, then there are vastly fewer smart, motivated poor people than there are in the middle and upper classes. Intelligence and motivation may be necessary to learning, but they are certainly not sufficent.<p>It's hard to say objectively whether anything is worth it. However, I don't think that hiking and paying for school are that similar - with hiking, you put the work in up front, and with school, you receive the diploma (and ostensibly the benefits of 4 years of learning) before you even have to start paying back your student loans. That said, doesn't it say something if all those who have done it say it's valuable?<p>In any case, I guess the fundamental issue that I see is the relationship between learning and applicable skills. Picking up skills is certainly learning, but learing is not always economically valuable. Schools do not exist to create wealth in their students - they exist to pass on knowledge. If schools are not passing on real-world skills, they are not intrinsically failing, nor is the real world somehow broken. I value learing for its own sake and am actually willing to forgo some matarial comfort for it. I suppose it all depends on your definitions of success.<p>I will admit that if people are going to school with no clear path and no motivation, and expecting to come out on the other side more employable, that's a problem. But again, it's a problem of expectations, not institutional reality.",1233342619

3697323,comment,3696486,3696486,1,0,nikcub,,,"Good post. Both HT and via have been part of blogging since the beginning. Creating a new icon and standards page won't stop the re-bloggers from re-blogging and not attributing.<p>I have started working on a technical solution to news attribution. The original Atom spec had a definition for a 'source', which isn't being used. It didn't get adapted into hNews. I am working on extending Microdata so that links to the main source of the story can be attributed and read by search engines and aggregators.<p>The idea is that with the support of search engines blogs and websites that don't properly attribute with microdata markup can be penalized as duplicate content. A lot of the re-blogging content networks rely on search referrals for traffic and revenue, and referrals from aggregators for readers. This would also solve the problem where stories from wire sources such as Reuters and AP are republished hundreds of times on hundreds of different news sites and pollute search results.<p>The standards already exist, they just need to be documented and adapted (and added to the BlogPost schema[1]). It just as important for applications to be able to read attribution links as it is for readers.<p>for eg. at the moment when Business Insider reposts one of Marco's posts there is no way for a crawler to know which is the original. Microdata can help that and help keep mirrored or ripped content out of search engines and aggregators (like Google News, etc.)<p>The other problem I have with this group is that the entire committee is made up of representatives from large media companies, and they are all writers. Not a single independent blog, or indy blogger represented, or part-time blogger, or designer, or programmer, or software implementor, etc.<p>[1] <a href=""http://schema.org/BlogPosting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://schema.org/BlogPosting</a>",1331621915

Frankly, this approach is almost always wrong and results in confusing interfaces and repetitive, difficult to maintain implementations.<p>Simplifying an experience to it's essence and ensuring that users learn quickly through consistency is key to design.<p>Bad designers are often quick to justify why two similar functions need different interfaces. Good designers understand that combining similar functions eliminates cognitive noise and creates the opportunity to add more features more easily and more understandably.<p>The author of this post strikes me as the bad sort of designer, one who views design as anything other than engineering and who justifies bad design with tortured ""emotional"" arguments.<p>Users are emotionally happy when they accomplish what they intend, understand and learn quickly, and feel confident they can repeat their result. Users are not happy when you force a single course of action through one-off behavior driven tunnel visioned design, leaving them confused and disoriented afterwards.<p>I've seen this before, and it is the product of egotistical designers caught up in their art instead of their users' experience.<p>Bill was right on this one.

We know how to sustainably produce large amounts of food from a given amount of arable land, and we have plenty of arable land to feed not just the current global population, but the projected maximum global population. It's true! We already have the ability to feed the largest population we'll ever have. True, Africa currently has food shortages, but as soon as Africa stops relying on peasant farming, that problem goes away. We can argue about when (or if) Africa is going to finally have their own Green Revolution[0], but...upcoming shortages? Do you know something the rest of us don't? :)</i><p>(I had a strong personal reaction to your tone; I find your tone really unpleasant.  I recognise this is my problem.

The only other option was to not have a ""px"" unit in the spec at all.<p>I mean, think about it.  Say you have a 600dpi printer.  Take a typical web page that sets its body element to be 1000px wide, because the person writing it was using a 96dpi display.  If ""px"" really meant ""smallest controllable dot"", that web page would print about 1.66 inches wide.  Which is obviously undesirable.  On the other hand, if ""px"" means ""the length that looks about as long as one pixel on a 96dpi display"" then the same web page would print about 8 inches wide, which is probably much closer to what both author and user wanted.<p>This is also exactly why Apple did the ""pixel doubling"" thing on iPhone 4 and iPad 3: it was done to prevent existing content that made certain assumptions about the visible size of ""px"" from breaking.",1331619105

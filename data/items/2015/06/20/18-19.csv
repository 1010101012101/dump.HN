Rebasing is a requirement here, and truthfully an operation with less mental overhead, since it&#x27;s actually just &quot;copy all of those commits over to here, then put the branch marker at the end of the new copy&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not even sure what you&#x27;re trying to say here. In general we don&#x27;t rewrite history of shared branches thus rebasing is certainly not a requirement.<p>> It kind of sounds to me as if you&#x27;re saying &quot;i don&#x27;t want my developers to not learn rebase because it&#x27;s easier if they learn a little less&quot;. Is that a correct understanding? If so, then you&#x27;re trading a little upfront work for a lot of cleanup work later on.<p>They&#x27;re not my developers. I&#x27;m one of the developers. I&#x27;m trying to educate my coworkers more in the ways of the git, but it&#x27;s slow progress. There has been no cleanup work so far, mostly because we&#x27;re not obsessive over having a &quot;clean history&quot;, and are instead more than happy with a realistic one.<p>> Depends on how shared they are and how big the fuck-up is. Everything is relative.<p>It&#x27;s not a fuck-up. Bugs happen, noticing and fixing them is progress. The revert commit references the issue tracker, and this itself is valuable history. Instead of the commits simply disappearing for a time.<p>> That developer gets a notice to get his shit together and gets fired if he persists.

After all the administrative fluff, the prof open his pdf and the first slide reads: &quot;Induction&quot;<p>I remember thinking &quot;Is this a maths or a CS course?&quot;<p>The second slide defined the set of natural numbers. As the prof start explaining the syntax and its meaning, I slowly start to realize the beauty of those few words:<p>Data Nat = Z | S Nat<p>where Z represent 0 and S the successor function.<p>We define the data type &quot;Nat&quot; to be either zero or the successor function applied to a &quot;Nat&quot;.<p>It was my &quot;ahah&quot; moment.

9750691,comment,9749660,9749660,0,0,fpgaminer,,,"Thank you for this article; very thought provoking.<p>My nitpick:<p>> When each student was given a heavy book of MNIST database, hundreds of pages filled with endless hand-written digit series, 60000 total, written in different styles, bold or italic, distinctly or sketchy.\n> ...\n> So, are you going to say that was not the case?<p>I understand the point the author is making.  Human brains are really good at taking limited examples and correctly extrapolating them to new cases.  That is, of course, the goal of intelligence.  Machine Learning has gotten better at this generalization, but has a long way to go.  And ConvNets as they exist today will not achieve that, no matter how much training you perform on them.<p>This specific example is inaccurate though.  Let us aggressively simplify and low-ball by saying that humans see at 24fps.  Humans of course don&#x27;t see in discrete frames, but this simplification doesn&#x27;t detract from my argument and makes quantifying easier.  So, if you give a human a single page of numbers, and they look at it for an hour, they have now seen >86k examples.  That&#x27;s 86k examples with twitching saccades, and from both eyes.  That&#x27;s in just an hour of looking at numbers.<p>Prior to being given that page of numbers, most children will have been alive for 4-5 years.  That&#x27;s 3 billion examples from a wide variety of subjects (we ignore sleeping cycles, because we&#x27;re already low-balling this fps figure, and because the brain is still learning and visualizing during sleep).<p>And humans are born with a pre-built visual cortex.  Edge detection, gradient detection, etc. are all already built for us.  CNNs learn that from scratch.<p>The author&#x27;s real point is still valid, though, don&#x27;t get me wrong.

That&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve tried in the past, and it can work. However, it has downsides as well. In particular, having the in-progress changes in component A around actually helps by providing the context to guide the changes in component B. So you avoid situations where, after you&#x27;ve continued working on component A, you realize that there&#x27;s still something missing to component B after all (which may be something as silly as an incorrect const-qualifier).<p>It&#x27;s also possible that our preferences depend on the kind of projects we&#x27;re working on.

It is impossible to point to what specifically is causing it, but I feel like people have gotten so used to ceding their identities, data, and privacy to massive organizations like Facebook (and those organizations engage in actions like tracking anyway) that culture in general just doesn&#x27;t care. The Internet used to be and still is a decentralized system which can empower people, but as it continues to get more and more centralized and governments and organizations don&#x27;t see broad resistance against invasions of privacy, the Internet becomes less and less something that empowers and more like something that can trap people. And that&#x27;s not even considering the Idiocracy-style apps and games that are getting pumped out on a daily basis that people are literally wasting their lives away on.<p>I imagine this comes off as a bit snobbish or melodramatic, but the very audience that uses this site are the people creating this future.

In which case it was a good thing to go against the will of the people.<p>Serious.  I&#x27;m not saying this particular decision was bad.  I&#x27;m just saying it was undemocratic.<p>---<p>One last thing: you say our &quot;democratically elected&quot; parliament had, among other things, a mandate to ratifying European treaties.  Only problem was, the <i>entire</i> political class wanted this particular treaty to happen.  Very few thought otherwise.  And those had other opinions about other subjects that often made them a big no-no for most people (extreme right and extreme left, mostly).<p>We did not have much choice when we elected our officials.  It was like, this guy who wanted the treaty to happen, and that gal who also wanted the treaty to happen, and <i>maybe</i> that crazy fellow who did not want this, but had also a couple insane ideas we did not endorse.",1434824086

9750591,comment,9746051,9750329,0,0,defen,,,"The equations of geometric algebra can be represented using matrices (perhaps with a non-euclidean metric for the inner product depending on application), so in that sense you don&#x27;t gain the ability to do anything that you couldn&#x27;t do with regular linear algebra.<p>The &quot;big wins&quot; are that the notation is simpler and easier to reason about, and everything is coordinate-free.  As an example, there is a model of 3 dimensional euclidean space that can be represented using a 5-dimensional GA (with 4,1 metric signature). Within this model, you have lines, planes, circles, spheres, etc; but you also have rotations, reflections, translations; and all of these things are just standard elements of the mathematics with no special cases. So you can multiply a translation and a  rotation and you get back the composition of those two things. Or you can multiply a sphere by a translation and you get back a sphere that has been translated by the specified amount. Or if you want to smoothly interpolate a rigid body motion (translation+rotation) between two points, you can take the logarithm of that motion. And again, this can all be done symbolically without resorting to coordinates - except at the very end, perhaps, if you want to map it onto an actual coordinate system :)<p>In terms of people applying it to more &quot;advanced&quot; subjects like Minkowski space or differential geometry - I&#x27;m not so sure.

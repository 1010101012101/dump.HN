2589256,comment,2588278,2588852,7,0,potatolicious,,,"There are a few killer features that come to mind (though I'm not sure if Google is already looking at them):<p>- no paper receipts. Do I want my receipts? In an ideal world, of course, but in real-life that just means more paper junk. Receipts are also awfully easy to lose - making returns onerous. Imagine having an electronic receipt instead of juggling all of that paper!<p>- doubling up on loyalty cards and payment. Instead of swiping a loyalty card once, and then again for actual payment, a NFC transaction can potentially do both at once. This also reduces the number of cards I have to carry around <i>dramatically</i>. Bonus points if they can make this work with my library card (with the added bonus: if I'm late returning a book, they can just <i>charge me</i>).<p>- more fine-grained budgeting. Right now Mint knows if I spent $50 at Staples. It doesn't know <i>what</i>, though. An itemized electronic transaction record would tell my budgeting software that the $50 was spent on printer ink, instead of, say, a new gadget.<p>- immediate feedback <i>without</i> extensive POS modification. I've noticed some grocery store checkouts now have a secondary printer that spits out special offers to you (assuming you scan your frequent shopper card). This can be expanded upon greatly <i>without</i> modifying POS hardware - i.e., pushing promotions directly to your phone.",1306440889

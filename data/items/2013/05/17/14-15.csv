I created this web app as a simple tool to automatically build a schedule for a list of selected movies at the festival. This tool takes the pain out of building a schedule--just select films that are interesting and let the tool do the rest.<p>If you're curious for more details, the scheduling algorithm uses some simple heuristics to generate a schedule since there's an exponential increase in potential schedules as you select more movies. Specifically I pick films that have no conflicts and use a lookup table of movies being shown each hour to more quickly check for conflicts. There's also some logic to weight the decision of a showtime based on different criteria like if the showtime occurs on weekends, early in the day, late in the day, etc. The algorithm isn't perfect and specifically doesn't try to schedule two films that only occur at the same time (I'd rather defer to the user to pick films that resolve conflict).<p>And yes, the tool uses a painfully stock Bootstrap CSS.

You actually seem to be against capitalism and an unregulated free market society. That is, you are against a world without regulation where the free market is allowed to run freely unchecked by government. However, this is not corporatism as it has nothing to do with corporations. In fact, corporations could be made illegal in capitalistic society by stating that business can only be conducted between individuals. One(capitalism and the free market) does not imply the other(corporations). I'm not sure if you'd still be against this(free market capitalism without corporations), but I imagine you would.<p>I think you might need to read up a bit more on capitalism, classical liberalism, libertarianism, crony capitalism, and perhaps marxism or communism. It might help you make your points better. There's a bit of each(and possibly others) mixed in your views.<p>Ron and Rand are libertarians. Also, Rand is more moderate and conservative(AKA republican in this case) than Ron. They don't always share the same views. For example, I doubt Rand would push the gold standard like Ron has in the past. This is one of the reasons I'd support Rand, but had my concerns about Ron. To be clear though, they are not corporatists. In fact, they(like most libertarians) very much believe that crony capitalism through extensive lobbying and regulation that prevents new markets from being created is precisely what's caused the somewhat recent rise of corporatism in the US.<p>As I'm merely trying to educate and not criticize you, so I won't go into why I disagree with your viewpoints.

One company finds a vulnerability or comes up with a new security solution, shares that information with other companies, and then everyone benefits. The idea is that many companies would assume that others will put in the resources to solve these problems, and that they can benefit from the resulting information.<p>Overall expenditure in cybersecurity may be increasing, however, I'm curious what the distribution of spending looks like across various industries. Are there a few players that make up the large portion of spending, or is it spread out among more companies. In the former, a free rider problem seems more likely, while in the latter I don't really see a problem.<p>Personally, I'd assume that many companies are very worried about cybersecurity and free riding is a minor issue.

The problem comes when you automatically generalize what happens to be offensive in your part of the world to the world at large.  It seems conceivable that in a foreign culture, such as the parent poster's France, this type of criticism might be considered a path to a sincere and personal relationship because it shows that you're willing to interact with your host on a personal level.  And it might not even be offensive if the criticism is normal and expected.  The host might even join in mocking his own ""foolish"" purchase.<p>The larger issue is that there's no conceivable way to know all of the ways you could offend someone else without spending a significant portion of your life immersed in their culture.  I lived in a major city in Spain for a couple of years, and there's a seriously pluralistic culture there with large immigrant populations from a number of continents.  My observation was that they tended to sidestep the unintentional-offense problem by limiting inter-cultural contacts.  Their interactions tended to focus around well-defined interfaces like buying something from a store.  It's a sad state of affairs but I'm not aware of an effective solution.",1368801371

I wouldn't ever talk about them as if they have similar principles.<p>I am not trying to defend Ron Paul or Rand here. I will tell you my own views on your list of things. Perhaps this will help you understand Ron better.<p>- Civil rights: I don't want my government to have colour-specific laws. I believe in individual rights. When I start a company, I reserve the right to discriminate against blacks, browns or whites. I am brown myself, and don't really care if a potential employer rejects me for my skin colour.<p>- Environmental regulation: I believe in the right to property. I pay money (tax) to agencies to protect these rights. If my neighbour cooks meth, it makes my own home smelly. The police, to protect my property rights, should prevent it. If he is cooking whatever crap he wants on his own farm, and there is no house or person in sight, why should the government make laws to have regulations about stinking the place up?<p>- Finance regulation: regulation and protection lead to corporatism. Your claiming Ron is corporatist based on this seems contrived, to put it mildly.<p>- Right to choose: I disagree with Ron on this. But then Ron  wants to leave it up to the state. Fine by me. I'll just walk out of the states I don't like.<p>- Equal pay: see my first note on individual rights. If I find an employer who values my skill enough to pay me more, I'll go there. My employees are free to do the same. I'll discriminate as I please. It's <i>my</i> company.<p>- Food inspection: why isn't the court system enough for this?<p>- Health care: Remember the days when Canadians crossed the border to pay for the service they get? Heck, I'm sure the healthcare industry loves these regulations: they can charge a million bucks to fix your common cold. The government will pay them with your tax or by printing more money. The problem in the US is not universal healthcare. The problem is expensive drugs. Fix your patent laws, and your regulatory hoops, and poor people will be able to afford most drugs themselves. And charities can cover the gap when the drugs are too expensive. That's how it works in India. (Actually, India has other problems: corruption and illiteracy.)<p>- Worker's rights: covered earlier.<p>- Immigration: easy immigration makes no sense in a welfare state.",1368801149

That is an absurd interpretation of the tax rules, and the logical endpoint of this thinking would be that no country in the world would receive any corporation tax save one, since all sales could be instantly sent through the lowest tax country, regardless of where they are actually processed, booked, or who they are sold to.<p>So the debate is whether what Google is doing <i>is legal</i>, or whether they are misrepresenting their position in saying that they don't conduct this business in the UK. Having watched the exchange, I'm inclined to say that Google are dissembling and trying to hide the truth about their activities in the UK in an attempt to pay no tax.

Shell companies are a serious problem for all tax regimes, and it's only going to get worse as globalisation spreads and moving companies becomes easier.<p>As to your comment on whether governments spend intelligently, there's no discount on taxes (and rightly so) depending on whether you agree with the current government or their spending decisions.

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 extended the federal government's authority to legislating morality through a stretched-to-the-max definition of the Commerce Clause.  It is that same Commerce Clause the government has since abused to all ends, and is why medical marijuana grow-houses and dispensaries are raided by the federal government in California, even though California has deemed it legal.  Given that there is no Constitutional provision for marijuana either way, that should de facto remain within the purview of the state.  The Civil Rights Act, and the New Deal before it began the malevolent precedent that was set.<p>My opinion is mixed on the matter.  Yes, I believe that it is an overreach of federal authority, but I also believe that it needed to be done to uphold the Constitution.  That said, there would have been many smaller ways to implement its tenets without allowing the federal government so much power to abuse, especially knowing that they have done so to much woe.<p>The Paul's <i>are</i> against a woman's right to choose, however, that should be tempered with the knowledge that they also believe that the federal government has no authority on the matter.  Even Ron Paul's ""Sanctity of Life Act"" would simply grant the states the authority to disallow abortion (or allow it, however they chose).  This is, I think, how we expect our federal government to run, wherein it meddles less with the lives of American citizens and prefers to leave those choices to the states, as the Constitution allows for.<p>On Health Care, I personally find their beliefs to be the right one.  In today's economic system, it would be hard to do, but considering the steps that got us to our inflated health care system, and how cheap and efficient it was before those steps were taken, I think it's the right way to go.  In short, the federal government, once upon a time, wrongly capped salaries for employees of all sorts.  Companies, looking for ways to entice workers, found a loophole - I can pay you the agreed upon max allowed, but I can augment that pay by taking care of your health care, life ensurance, etc., as perks.  Now that health care was being paid out of 'big pockets', costs rose because of the additional abstraction between the actual costs and those paying for the care.  Since then, the federal government has repealed salary limitations, but companies still provide perks, and health care is still ridiculous.  The bar on competition is set so arbitrarily high that it persists.  If individuals were to pay for health care out of their own pockets, I have little doubt (though no proof, except history) that costs would baseline back to affordable.<p>I think that Obamacare worsens the situation by adding yet another layer of abstraction to even deeper pockets, FYI, but that is my own personal belief.<p>Regarding immigration, I think you exaggerate.  Yes, they want to tighten the borders.  Yes, they want to regulate immigration more.  The United States currently has some of the most permissive immigration laws in the first world, and those laws are routinely exploited to benefit the exploiters.  If we didn't have the social safety net that we had, it would be a non-issue, but as the social safety net that exists is taxpayer funded, it <i>is</i> unfair.  That is an opinion, naturally, but it is a generally accepted truth by both major parties, which is why immigration reform is such a hot-button issue.  Sadly, it has devolved into an election issue, as whoever can grant amnesty first will likely win the largest number of new voters to their party.<p>All that said, I do agree that your rationale isn't ""contrarian bullshit"", and I appreciate you taking the time to educate others to your opinion.  Obviously, these are <i>complicated</i> issues, with a myriad of possible solutions, some of which likely haven't even been considered (or even thought up) yet.  Regardless, neither your opinion nor mine are certain to be 'right'.  At best, they're both varying degrees of both right and wrong.",1368800400

For example, on my team of ~15 people there were plenty of individuals doing interesting stuff, but if you were SWE 2-3 you were fucked. Your boss could take advantage of the fact that SWE 3's are pretty much considered to be parasites not worthy of consideration as humans. You'd never get to work on a green field and actually have an opportunity to prove yourself.<p>The only thing that matters at Google is your rank and your ""calibration score"". That, and nothing else, determines what projects are available to you. If you're willing to spend 5+ years playing politics and trading favors in order to get promo story you need, then you can get something passably interesting.",1368799723

The perl community developed something specific to perl again, and something that was more intimate, casual, and affordable. There are YAPC conferences all over the world, like YAPC::EU and YAPC::Asia and others.<p>My experience is only with the North American one, and it's typically 3 days of technical sessions with one or more optional days of more formal classes before or after it.<p>A conference ticket is cheap, say $100, and you can get a dorm room for cheaper than a hotel room if you like. That's part of the effort to make the conference affordable and open to anyone.<p>Another, more recent part of that effort seems to be adopting a more formal code of conduct. I think that's popular with a lot of technical conferences these days. Recently, Schwern, one of the prominent members of the perl community withdrew from the conference and described why here: <a href=""http://blog.schwern.net/2013/05/15/yapcna-2013-withdrawal/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.schwern.net/2013/05/15/yapcna-2013-withdrawal/</a> The article linked from this HN post seems to be a reaction to that.<p>Anyway, YAPC::NA is in Austin this year, and should be a great conference.

The lawsuit is almost certainly motivated by the FDA action and trying to grab a bad-faith payday, but the existence of various other BS products where the management actually bothered to talk to a lawyer doesn&#x27;t mean that 23andme was exempt from talking to a lawyer themselves.",1386032387

Read the response of the guy who rejected it here:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/joyent/libuv/pull/1015#issuecomment-29538615\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/joyent/libuv/pull/1015#issuecomment-29538...</a><p><i>Hi all, let me try to clear up a few things.<p>Why I rejected the pull request. Us maintainers tend to \n reject tiny doc changes because they&#x27;re often more trouble \n than they&#x27;re worth. You have to collect and check the CLA, \n it makes git blame less effective, etc.<p>That&#x27;s why the usual approach to such pull requests is \n &#x27;no, unless&#x27; - in this case the &#x27;unless&#x27; should probably \n have applied. To me as a non-native speaker, the \n difference between &#x27;him&#x27; and &#x27;them&#x27; seems academic but \n hey, if it gets us scores of female contributors, who am I \n to object?<p>Why I reverted the commit. In hindsight, I should have \n given Isaac the benefit of the doubt because I don&#x27;t doubt \n that he acted with the best of intentions. On the other \n hand, if another committer jumped the line like that, I \n would have done the same thing. We have procedures in \n place and no one is exempt from them.<p>To the people that felt it necessary to call me a \n misogynist: I volunteer in a mentorship program that gets \n young people - especially young women - involved in \n technology. How many of you go out and actively try to \n increase the number of women in the field?<p>I&#x27;m probably going to step back from libuv and node.js \n core development. I do it more out a sense of duty than \n anything else. If this is what I have to deal with, then \n I&#x27;d just as rather do something else. Hope that clears\n things up. Thanks.</i>",1386032385

Even aside from the myriad edge cases around date arithmetic, an administrator (or NTP) can always reset the clock between the endpoints of your interval, and your computation may be very wrong.<p>If you want a human timestamp, use gettimeofday[0] and related functions.  If you want something to compute actual elapsed seconds with, use high-resolution timestamps([2] and [3]).

To me, that insistence can only come from one \n    place: that gender—specifically, masculinity—is inextricably \n    linked to software, and that&#x27;s not an attitude that Joyent \n    tolerates.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nSeriously? You&#x27;re attributing this insistence to malice without considering another viewpoint: This could be simple grammar nazism from someone who takes a prescriptionist (as opposed to a descriptionist) viewpoint on English grammar. For a very long time, gendered pronouns have been considered the grammatically correct form. Acceptance of gender neutral form is relatively new, maybe one to three decades old in common use. There are other possibilities than this being a case of active overt sexism. At the end of the day, you need to remember that we are in an industry where we all rubberneck at a huge debate over the proper use of the semicolon in Javascript to cite one example.<p>Gendered pronouns becoming an issue of sexism entered the discussion the same way that the concepts of double negatives entered the English language. Someone simple decided to make a stink about it until everyone believed it. I don&#x27;t know who was responsible for making gendered pronouns a sexism issue in English, but in the case of double negatives, you can attribute that popular language change to Bishop Robert Lowth, when he published A Short Introduction to English Grammar with Critical Notes in 1762.<p>At the end of the day most romance languages are inextricably linked to a linguistic concept of gender, but you don&#x27;t see any speakers of those languages making a big issue about the political correctness of their mother tongue. Why? Because linguistic gender and sexual gender are extremely weakly related and they are only strongly related in English because a strong relationship has been argued for by people with nothing better to do until it is a popular concept.",1386031234

That article is old and I really wish it wasn&#x27;t on the front page. If I remember correctly, at the time this was written, there were some pretty big outages and failures that originated from apps assuming time was pretty much a linear monotonic value. So the motivation to write this was not only for myself, but to attempt and find a better solution for timestamps as needed by many apps.<p>There is no technical reason for the timestamp to jump around, and to convert to and from &quot;human&quot; time we already need libraries (especially if we&#x27;re looking at points in the past or the future), so the argument that system timestamps <i>MUST</i> map to actual time of day is somewhat moot. As it is, the Unix timestamp attempts to be somewhat in the middle, in the end satisfying neither computer nor human requirements.

I wrote this post a long time ago to suggest a strict(er) divide between computer timestamps and human timestamps, because Unix timestamps are in effect neither.<p>There are countless apps that implicitly assume timestamps are linearly counted upwards. Most people would say those are bugs, but they&#x27;d only be right on superficial grounds. What most applications rightly want is a monotonic, predictable way to count the passing of time and to exchange that data with other apps.<p>My idea was to introduce such a linear counter for apps that want it, not (as some people here obtusely suggested) replacing the Unix timestamp with this no matter the ecosystem breakage.",1386029478

Between those who just don&#x27;t want a smartphone, and those who carry enough computing power to not want yet another Cray 2 in a pocket, there&#x27;s a large niche for a phone that is just a phone, syncs contacts effortlessly, eliminates every unnecessary/redundant call step, is just the right size & shape, uses every available network aggressively & seamlessly, leverages every service to save money, and has as clear & pristine a sound as makes audiophiles drool.

I received <i>that</i> call 15 minutes later, and worked with the manager (submitting specific emails and identifying where on their network the problems were manifesting) for a couple of months during which time the spam volumes fell well over 90%.<p>Part of the trick is knowing how to navigate / manipulate the system, and finding a problem they acknowledge as theirs.  But in that particular case (and a small handful of others) I found the company highly responsive.<p>Now, several years later when I&#x27;d bought both a shrinkwrap product and support contract to specifically resolve a data issue with a product of theirs, I got sandbagged.  Demanded my money back for the contract.<p>And no, I&#x27;m not a fan of Microsoft.  But they do (at times at least) know how to run a business.",1386029022

Testing now on the two laptops, both have a built-in microphone.  I was expecting the microphone would be dependent upon the built-in webcam and at least light up the webcam light when it was &quot;turned on&quot; but that is apparently not the case with either one.  I used the built-in Windows Sound Recorder to record ambient sound in the room I&#x27;m in just now and there was no indication that it was recording anything.  Scary stuff.",1386028953

They invented this thing called the &quot;paragraph&quot; some thousand years ago.[1] It lets you organize several or more sentences into coherent blocks of text expressing complex thoughts. Paragraphs allow you to get across multiple simpler points, expressed as individual sentences, in a succinct way that allows your reader to avoid excessive and unnecessary scrolling.<p>Also, for something that apparently involves Africa,[2] the loading speed of that page over my iPad&#x27;s LTE is shameful.<p>[1] The paragraph was already in use in English by the time of  Beowulf, between the 8th and 11th century.<p>[2] Apparently.

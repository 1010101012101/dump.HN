But the size of the vegan movement is totally out of proportion to its veracity.<p>Take the whole ""meat is murder"" slogan.  It's ridiculous from the outset and completely ignores our existence within the earth's ecosystem.  I mean industrialized animal farming is fairly horrific, but the way to stop that is by advocating and <i>paying the premium</i> for more sustainably raised meat.  Opting out of meat entirely does nothing to change the industry, because most people will always eat some meat if they can afford it.<p>Meanwhile, as vegans focus on the elimination of meat from our diets, they practically ignore the industrialized food that wreaks direct reproducible havoc on our metabolisms causing epidemic obesity and diabetes.  Consider the effect of refined and reconstituted carbohydrates made from federally subsidized crops that make the most devastatingly unhealthy food items also the cheapest.  Just the effects of soda pop alone are worthy of an international movement.",1290484732

Python is ten times easier and you can go from zero to ninja in one day.

Webapp can do it all with a couple of utilities and the template engine (same as django) in a couple of lines.<p>You'll be amazed at how simple it is to build an app, of any size, once you master the basics about models, sessions, authentication, etc.<p>You don't need sql connections, chmod configs, apache htaccess, and stuff like that. Just get some data and render it with a template. Fucking easy!<p>Don't believe me? You lose, not me. Give it a try, you'll be surprised.<p>I am a happy GAE user and my next startup (which I hope will have a million visits a day) runs on AppEngine and no worries at all about handling them all. Google will be there for me.<p>GAE 1.4 will come with Channel API, an easy way to send messages back and forth, we just got multitenancy, longer task queues and cron jobs, xmpp, etc.<p>You get it all at no cost, you pay only a couple of dollars when you need it, when you get slashdotted, dugg or techcrunched.

Americans and, in particular, Americans with hiring authority <i>do not respond well</i> to excessive modesty.  You should stop saying things like ""I have to admit that I am not the smartest person"" and ""My brain has been dumb for several years.""<p>Saying things like this will make Americans with hiring authority think that either you are being sincere and are stupid (no hire), that you have severe personality issues which will make you difficult to work with (no hire), or that you are culturally inept and will be difficult to work with (no hire).  There is a fairly easy way to avoid these difficulties: find a model of culturally correct behavior and act like they do.  Your model person would likely a) be confident that they are well-qualified with regards to what they want to be hired to do and b) not brag <i>excessively</i> about their competence.  Don't worry about where the exact balancing point between confidence and bragging is -- any attempt to move closer to it will make you more successful at locating employment than you are currently.<p>Also, getting employed is a matter of selling something (selling your future employers on the notion that they should employ you).  Successful sales is more about them and their needs than it is about you and your story.  Your relationship with your parents, your home culture, the laptop you bought, etc, do not constitute reasons why a particular company should hire you.  You should not talk about them.  Instead, you should figure out what the company needs and point to specific, identifiable experiences which demonstrate that you will successfully be able to meet that need.",1290482845

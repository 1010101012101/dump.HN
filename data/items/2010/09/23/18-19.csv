One of the nice things about RoR is that a model class can be as short as two lines:<p><pre><code>    class MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base\n    end\n</code></pre>\nand everything else happens by ""magic"".  Our system has a few classes like that.  OTOH, we also have model classes with thousands of lines of complicated business logic.

He’s amazingly talented, I can’t even explain how talented he is.  But all is not rosy... His story thus far is a story of tragedy and wasted potential.  I assumed he was a successful chessplayer.

Then I read this comment Sebastian wrote earlier today:<p>""I like chess, but I wish my dad would stop bragging when he beats me (I'm not even a C-class player.)""<p>WTF?  Sebastian, dude, with your focus and brains, you could be an international master.  Even if you don't fully appreciate the beauty of chess, your tournament games would entertain hundreds of players online, and help educate and inspire young players.

1720819,comment,1719975,1720050,0,0,m104,,,"Seriously, Joel, Facebook just needs to ""optimize"" a bit and they'll be more profitable?  Really?  With a valuation of $33 billion, Facebook needs to make a bit more than a dime or two extra from their users.  They need a ton of real dollars from each and every user or (more likely) dozens or hundreds of dollars from some users and nothing from the rest.  How are they going to do that, exactly?<p>How will Facebook change its platform to convert its hundreds of millions of users, who signed up for a free party, into billions of dollars per year <i>without</i> spoiling the party?  No one likes getting invited to a party with their friends only to find that the beer isn't free after 11:30, or worse, they've been tricked into attending an MLM meeting.  If Facebook could convert eyeballs to dollars the way Google can, there was no reason not to do so when they had 50 million users, or 100 million, or 200 million... It hasn't been done, though, because it would spoil the party and stop that lovely flow of VC money.<p>I am just gobsmacked that, within just a few years of the US housing market bubble popping and the financial empires getting caught with their pants down, you would continue to support the speculators' fantasy of pre-IPO tech valuations.  These types of valuations aren't just irresponsible or insane, they're scams!  The consumers have no money or credit left, so the easy money is going to come from gullible investors.",1285268172

Notch (of minecraft fame) spent several years making little java applet games with barely any fanfare and barely eking out an earning if at all (he had a few day jobs prior to breaking free and founding Mojang Specifications).<p>There's no time limit in creating or running your own business, and there is no marker of success except those defined by the founder's goals.

Underlying their disagreement are two opposing startup philosophies: 1) the ""37 signals"" way, i.e. run your startup like a business, worry about real profits and losses, and don't bother trying to become the next ""Facebook"" or ""Google"" and 2) the ""VC"" way, which in a sense Joel happens to be representing here, i.e. build a great idea, attract funding, worry about profit when you've gained traction, etc.<p>These are hugely important themes in nearly every discussion that takes place about entrepreneurship here on HN. And while you may have observed only ""fighting,"" speaking personally I learned a lot about secondary markets etc. from hearing Joel's side. It cost me all of two minutes time, during any point of which I could have clicked away and done something else.<p>I think it speaks volumes about the community that PG and others have built here that to this day you'll find ""big shots"" like DHH and Joel coming here to air out their difference. I don't know of many other communities that have fostered such an environment within their niche for so long.  Discussions like this remind me of how <i>awesome</i> HN is and continues to be.<p>Lastly, if you're not interested in a discussion, just don't read it.

That project eventually had 200Mhz MIPS SMP boxes moving data through NFS at close to 1Gbyte/sec 24x7.\nSo far as I know, nobody else has ever come close to that even with 10x faster CPUs.<p>Most of the people in this thread pretty clearly don't understand the issues involved, Rob included (sorry, Rob, go talk to Greg).  Moving lots and lots of data very quickly precludes looking at each byte by the CPU.  The only thing that should look at each byte is a DMA engine.<p>Sendfile(2) is a hack, that's true.  It is a subset of what I imagined splice(2) could be (actually splice(3), the syscalls are pull(2) and push(2)).

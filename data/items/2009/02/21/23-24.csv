I think each of us was a little shy at first, but once that faded we didn't feel held back by the pairing.<p>We used it mostly for collaborative design. It was helpful for bringing a new team member up to speed on our code base.

We were approached with the intent to acquire, but the management team there was - to put it mildly - a little strange, so we declined. After 3 years they had burned through the whole wad and the plug was pulled.<p>It was the weirdest experience, to out-compete a company that has such enormous backing with a team of very few but very dedicated people in two small offices (one in Toronto, another near Amsterdam).",1235260350

490198,comment,489778,490068,0,0,davidw,,,"> where are your examples of companies taking that code and ""closing it up"", making significant money off of that work, and without giving anything back?<p>Sun Microsystems and BSD?  They have given stuff back, but basically, they did take BSD proprietary in a way that it took years to 'recover' from, in terms of a purely open source system.<p>This debate doesn't have one 'winner'.  I suspect if you wanted to do some sort of rigorous, formal, analysis, you would turn to game theory.  Barring that, though, I think that there are situations where the GPL is best: everyone can contribute knowing that no one will ""run away with the pot"", by, say, hiring up the core developers and taking the system proprietary.  In other cases, BSD is best - with lots of software that gets used as a library, if it's under the GPL, even if companies want to contribute and be good open source citizens, they really can't, and so you lose any possibility of getting good work from companies.  Even the FSF realized this and created the LGPL.  So, like many things, it can't be boiled down to a simplistic ""this one is better"" type answer.  It really does depend on the situation.",1235260280

However, it's probably worth mentioning here what I've understood from economists: the banks are not nearly as broke as they say they are -- the ones that are still in business, anyway. If they were really that broke, they wouldn't have taken the TARP money to buy out competitors and give upper management the fat bonuses. The banks that <i>are</i> going out of business ... well, they aren't, really. They're being bought out (e.g. WaMu) and the assets are now held by the parent bank.

Hackers consider themselves something of an elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new members are gladly welcome.

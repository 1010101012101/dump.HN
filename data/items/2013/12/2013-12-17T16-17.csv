6922075,comment,6920453,6921924,6,0,hsitz,,,"There is no legal requirement that contracting parties give equal value in exchange.  What you&#x27;re referring to is commonly referred to as the &quot;consideration&quot; required for a valid contract, but it is easily satisfied.  It does not require equal value, it requires merely that &quot;something&quot; be given by both sides.  E.g., if the author of an article desires to have it published, a publisher&#x27;s mere promise to publish could serve as consideration for the author&#x27;s transfer of copyright.  &quot;We&#x27;ll promise to publish this if you transfer copyright to us.&quot;  That would be a perfectly valid agreement.<p>Also, you say &quot;The authors pay Elsevier to coordinate peer review and publish using their brand names. This necessarily includes granting a license to Elsevier to copy and distribute the author&#x27;s work.&quot;  Well, transfer of copyright by author could be seen as simply part of the payment to Elsevier to coordinate peer review and publish the article.  Consideration need not be, and very frequently is not, in the form of money.  In fact, even in contracts where one party provides consideration in the form of money, the other party usually provides its consideration by promising to perform a service, or to transfer goods other than money.<p>There is a doctrine wherein otherwise valid contracts can be voided because of &quot;unconscionability&quot;.  Although the term is thrown about a lot, contracts -- even very one-sided contracts -- are almost never voided for unconscionability.  The whole idea of contracts is that two private parties agree to terms to apply between themselves.  Courts are thus very hesitant to intrude, unless there is a specific legal reason to do so, not just a general charge of &#x27;unconscionability&#x27;.",1387298804

But it will be formed regardless of the abilities, personalities, or intentions of the people involved. The very fact that we are individuals, with different talents, predispositions, and backgrounds, makes this inevitable.

It makes dependency management a gigantic pain in the ass and forces you to target your code to a specific version of an operating system. You can&#x27;t take a system that works just fine in Fedora and move it to Debian without making sure the gem version differences don&#x27;t break anything.<p>In today&#x27;s cloud-based hosting environment, you want to preserve mobility whenever possible, and Bundler does a better job of managing Ruby dependencies than dpkg/yum does. You can then use configuration management to get a system bootstrapped to a base where all your Ruby projects can run, then Bundler can take care of project-specific dependencies. It&#x27;s not perfect, a lot of times a project gem will require system dependencies, like MySQL, but the separation of concerns does help a bit.<p>You should, however, use system Ruby because using RVM / Rbenv in production vastly increases complexity, and because the system dependencies that your gems have will be the right versions.

There is no typical lag time, it&#x27;s updated whenever the packager feels like it. You can file bugs at redhat bugzilla to try and motivate them to update packages sooner, if you want something specific.<p>On the plus side, you get security updates, and any gems that are packaged should be compatible with each other to some extent. In general, I think ruby packages are good for end-users, but maybe not great for developing ruby applications or other gems.<p>(I don&#x27;t mean to rag on Fedora packaging here — I&#x27;m a Fedora packager!

Inefficient routing, unstable communication, high latency and low bandwidth. You have to do a lot more work to achieve things that would otherwise be simple and straightforward.<p>Take human communications, for example. They&#x27;re largely decentralized by default, but we use centralized services to improve efficiency. If some piece of information needs to be disseminated to a large population over a period of time, we first record the message, then we post it in a centralized location viewable by lots of clients[1]. Those clients can then go back and distribute the information to its connected peers[2], but technology also allows us to distribute subscriptions of this information to a wider population in a variety of media[3]. ([1]stone tablets, [2]town crier, [3]newspapers/television)<p>Modern people are afraid of centralization in the Internet because they are suddenly realizing they have no real control over the content or medium. But this is the case with all other forms of centralized mass communication, too. People are also afraid of their lack of control over their data, which is tantamount in these days to a form of property. Anyone would freak out if the contents of their house were suddenly only available at the discretion of some conglomerate!<p>But you don&#x27;t need &quot;decentralization&quot; to keep a backup of your data. Most of it originates from you anyway, and you can store it before you publish it. Some service providers even provide methods to download all your data, though obviously you can&#x27;t rely on everyone providing you that option (unless someone passes a law...)<p>On top of all this, the internet is already a system of decentralized networks and services. You can just hook in your own services into the network at any point therein and maintain them yourself. The only restriction is really by the ISP, and there&#x27;s lots of those to choose from in most developed countries. Personally I think we should consider the internet a combination of utility and public highway, since at this point we all need access, but we also need competition due to the sensitivity of limits on network access.",1387296843

Forgive me for pasting such a large portion of the Esquire article cited in another comment:<p>&quot;In the late 1980s, a new counterfeit hundred, the most perfect counterfeit yet made, began appearing in circulation. It looked identical to the real thing, betrayed visually, at least, under only the most rigorous forensic testing. (Some minor flaws were visible after enormous copies of the bills were made, but these were probably purposeful. Its makers didn&#x27;t want to be suckered by their own handiwork.) Although the counterfeit came to America mostly on boats from gangs in China, it was eventually traced to North Korea, where it was believed to have been manufactured by the North Korean government on its own presses. Since then, new generations of the same counterfeit have appeared, including a big-head version, mimicking the redesigned hundred that entered circulation in 1996. This family of bogus notes has been given its own title, one that befits its almost mythical stature: the North Korean supernote.<p>Some stories about the supernote sound more like legend than fact — like its being laundered by a bank in Macao called the Banco Delta Asia, or several thousand of them somehow appearing overnight in Lima, threatening to tip over the entire Peruvian economy. But there remains one truth in the supernote&#x27;s history that has never been forgotten: It was first detected at the Central Bank of the Philippines by a teller, given pause only by the same nebulous flaw that betrays the majority of counterfeits. It just didn&#x27;t feel right.&quot;",1387296013

1361531,comment,1358889,1359667,0,0,ABrandt,,,"This is true, we did put quite a bit of effort into properly forecasting demand. At the end of each day I'd count every piece of food we had left, feed that into some software along with some variables such as weather, and try to calculate what we needed to bake that night. Turns out even with an extremely short forecasting horizon, it's damn near impossible to accurately predict how much fresh bread people want in any given day at a particular store. (I'm not sure if we did use one standard deviation, and if we did that would only account for 68.3% of variation anyways). I've literally been screamed at for not having any whole-grain bread left 10 mins. before closing time.<p>If I was to manage this non-profit store, I wouldn't bake according to expected demand. In this particular scenario, a reasonable amount of stock-outs would mean that you have more money left at the end of the day to donate to charity rather than covering the production costs of waste. (Of course you would want to avoid creating ill-will with <i>too much</i> stock-out).<p>But the real reason this makes sense for Panera is that they're already donating a ton of goods to charity everyday. For this store, instead of donating bread, they'll be donating cold hard cash that people fork over. Great PR and great for the community.",1274288344

1361507,comment,1360863,1361265,0,0,lmkg,,,"At my college, the ""gatekeeper"" CS course was notorious, even among non-CS majors. Your code could compile, pass all the unit tests, have optimal algorithmic efficiency and highly optimized runtime... and you could still get a C- because you used inconsistent capitalization for your variable names, or had misspellings in your comments[1]. May  the ghost of Dijkstra have mercy on you if you did anything ""clever"" at the high level.<p>The goal, of course, is not that later on you will spend half your coding time thinking about variable capitalization. The goal is that when you're writing your code, you pick good variable names automatically because you've built up the reflex, by having the idea pounded into your head with the wrath of an angry god. Anecdotally, the class was largely successful in its goal of setting up good habits before the bad ones settled in. After taking that class, people wrote code that was significantly more readable and maintainable than they had written before, and the habits tended to stick.<p>I suspect that at least part of the problems with effective communications is that we develop our early communications largely ad-hoc, and tend to build up a lot of bad habits in the process. Without concentrated effort to correct this habits, they remain and reinforce themselves through repetition. And of course, concentrated effort doesn't scale well.<p>[1] Granted, part of this was because the class was graded on a negative curve. If everyone got 145/150, then 145 is the average, which means a C.",1274287915

1361498,comment,1361163,1361328,0,0,jamesbritt,,,"""The patent system's primary goal seems to have become protecting patent holders, which really ought to be only a secondary function. The original purpose of patents was to encourage innovations that would benefit society. It was a simple trade: if you invent something that will help society, society will give you protection against competition for some period of time.""<p>Exactly.   How do you have one without the other?  Should Microsoft (or any other patent holder) go to court and  argue on the basis that society is not being well served?<p>The patent owner needs to show harm, which is what patent law was supposed to protect them from.  The stated reason for such laws is ""to promote the progress of science and useful arts"", but if you are a patent or copyright holder your argument needs to be that you are not being provided the protection you had expected under the law.<p>""And in the case of software patents like the ones in this suit, society receives very little benefit for the protection it provides.""<p>That may be.  Some patents are for essentially trivial ideas, or ideas that have been in the ether for quite some time.

Assuming this continuous deployment is something like ""developer picks up bug, hacks out whatever solution works, deploys it five minutes later"", then you are punting on any issue that may require a bit more introspection. This most notably includes security, but there's other things that this procedure will fry too, like longterm maintainability and such. Not to mention offloading QA onto your customers, which may work for a free webservice holding nothing of particular value but hardly works for everybody. (And I hope they have good backups.)<p>With this logic, it's perfectly fair to point out that WordPress's security record is absolute shit (tptacek: ""There are unforced errors in Wordpress. Every web application will have a cross-site scripting mistake. It takes a special one to have ""anonymous commenter"" -> ""admin"" privilege escalation, or executable style templates."" - <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1328583"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1328583</a>) and it's fair to conclude that this ""We systematically and deliberately fail to check our code before deploying it!"" approach to development may be a contributing factor.<p>Now, nothing stops you from implementing ""take bug, code solution, run it through code review and QA, deploy"" on a patch-by-patch basis, but I have a hard time imagining making 20 releases a day with that procedure, so I'm assuming that's not what they are doing with some reason.<p>Basically, what I'm saying here is that hearing WordPress advocate this model is a strong argument against it. If they honestly think it's not costing them anything, or even just a net benefit, then I call their judgment into question. Or perhaps rather, further into question, since I think their security track record was already calling their judgment into question.",1274287547

A nice aspect of targeting C is that it's portable to pretty much everywhere, has multiple good compilers, and is low-level enough that you can compile a lot of different constructs to it efficiently (though not everything). But you'll end up reimplementing nontrivial infrastructure and a runtime if you're compiling a high-level language; e.g., does your source language have garbage collection? Any sort of dynamic features? If yes, are they similar enough to the semantics of any existing language that if you targeted that language you might be able to piggyback on its features, e.g. use the target language's GC to do your GC?

That's a clear user-centric decision process.<p>As for forking Firefox, it's not something being done explicitly and it's not a clear team, but people are playing around with ideas along those lines and the culture is very open to that process.  Jetpack actually has some basis in a split like that (then being brought back to the mainline).<p>No fault to the author, these things are by no means obvious (and I myself can only claim to have a vague sense of what's going on)... but I feel more optimistic the more I know about how decisions and experimentation is done at Mozilla.<p>Sometimes Firefox people come off as very defensive... which I find a little off-putting, but I think it's also a matter of avoiding panic.

It's shocking how many students are admitted that do not know how to write an essay.  I find that I spend <i>at least</i> half an hour per 10-page essay and almost always end up drowning them (even the good ones) in red ink.<p>Perhaps this is due to growing up with a mother who worked as an editor, but I tend to think that I'm not being overly harsh when I have to repeat the same comments over and over again: proofread for typos, needs a strong introduction, put your thesis up front, number your pages, use consistent formatting, punctuation inside quote marks, footnotes outside quote marks, don't use big fonts / extra spacing to pad the paper's length, use a (correctly formatted) bibliography, don't cite Wikipedia (or any encyclopedia), give the reader a roadmap up front, etc.",1274284944

This past January I completed a Ph.D. in physics in an interfacial science/polymer physics/biophysics group.  During my time I found that one of the aspects that I really enjoyed was performing data analysis.  A large part of my work involved writing custom scripts in Matlab to model experiments or to analyze experimental data.  As I'm not particularly interested in continuing on in academia, I'm really beginning to consider the idea that rebranding or retraining myself in areas of data mining and analysis may be the way to go.  I'm not sure how best to accomplish this either.  I let the thought of doing a quick Masters enter my mind but that's not ideal for me.  I think I can quickly come up to speed on theoretical considerations I might be lacking so another option may be to just convince a company to give me a shot.",1274284936

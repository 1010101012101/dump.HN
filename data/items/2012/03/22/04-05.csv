This seems like a more easily updated model than really unique interactive content in each issue because the artwork can be generic.<p>The iPad would probably be more usable for this than the web, because it is easier, more natural, and is a more common interaction paradigm to interact with sliders and such on the iPad versus the web.

YOU NEED TO TALK TO A PROFESSIONAL! there is someone that loves you that will be hurt very bad if they loose you, keep your mind fixed on that fact until you are better.<p>As for the other issues many developers are bad at extracting their worth from a company, but remember if you don't ask no one will give it to you. Think about it this way if you are at the point that you feel like you have nothing left to loose and could kill yourself, then what do you have to loose in asking for more money and if they don't give it to you, talk to another company don't convince yourself that no one will pay what you are asking you would be surprised at how many that will if they believe that you can deliver.<p>You are in a high growth country where things are projected to get better and better keep focused on that.<p>Front-end skills are in high demand, try to find some remote US work and charge US rates, get a US PO Box and bill from that address have it forward to your address in Brazil.

Apart from that I also get few requests from other hackers/startups to be their co-founder.<p>I have been thinking about it from some time now and have found a way around. I will do something similar to ycombinator minus funding. I will give my full attention as a founder to only one startup at a time but for other startup ideas (mine or other people's) I will work as technology/business adviser for 5%-10% equity. I will give them technology/business related advice or will code/design on weekends. Networking with other hackers/founders will be important as I would need people who can give their full time and take these startups forward with little guidance and help from me. I'm sure there are many hackers looking for good ideas for startup or stuck with wrong ideas.<p>For my own ideas, I will quickly develop a functional prototype using bootstrap/django and will look for hackers who can take the work forward.<p>I'm not sure whether this strategy will work or not but there is no harm trying it.",1332391971

But at higher PPIs, the aliasing effects of rasterization are much less, you could almost turn anti-aliasing off at retina display levels, so vectors begin to make more sense.<p>Of course, the problem is that there are still a lot of displays out there where anti-aliasing is necessary, and for some reasons our algorithms always screw it up if done in real time. Perhaps we just need better algorithms (e.g., see Direct2D).<p>The final problem they mention is one of physical size, but it makes sense that you'd have a lesser detailed vector for something that is really small vs. something that is very big; its a design issue.",1332391968

I imagine salary/compensation will make the short list for most commonly occurring response to the original question.<p>My rationale is based on the sentiment that I see repeated around HN and the blogosphere that surrounds it. Granted, this may be a case of people who spend so much time talking about X aren't out doing X, but its a pretty clear impression that anyone who expresses salary as being overly important is not ""passionate"" enough or just sees programming as a job. I think anyone who regularly parses these blogs for hiring advice, and thus who would actually ask this question in an interview, are precisely the ones to eat up the sentiment that ""the best programmers don't care much about salary"". And since every startup thinks they need rockstars or ninjas, they'll happily write off anyone who seemingly expresses this sentiment. Admittedly, I don't really have any first hand experience interviewing for the typical Silicon Valley startup, so I'd be happy to hear that my impression is totally wrong.",1332391641

What's funny to me is that people really do expect me to answer it....I put that cut there at the end, imposing an ambiguity from outside the film.""<p>:)<p>I agree that resolving the entire film as simply a dream would be a huge let down.  If it were another film, would be content to stop there.  For my money though, resolving that the ending puts Cobb firmly back into reality is also highly unsatisfactory.  The more interesting (and I believe) intended result is force the viewer to question their <i>own</i> sense of reality.  Haven't you ever had a dream that was so realistic that you were certain it was real - until you woke up?  How do know for sure that we are not simply living a dream that we will one day wake up from?<p>There is a book by Stanislaw Lem that beautifully explores this sort of idea.  In the story, there is mad scientist fellow that has a room full of electronic brains, each being slowly fed a life story via a series of slowly rotating magnetic drums.  To the individual brains, the story that they are being told IS their life - they have no idea that they are simply boxes in some mad scientist's laboratory.  The book goes onto suggest that our own lives may simply be programmed by a mad scientist who exists a level up from us.<p>I believe this it is this sort questioning of reality that Nolan is trying to impress upon the viewer.  Reducing the whole thing to just a sci-fi film about a couple of dreamwalkers makes it seem frankly one-dimensional and uninteresting.",1332391495

The point is that in China, everything gets cloned really quickly and the big players keep winning the market by pushing the new services out to their existing users, who don't seem to care that much about not letting one company dominate. It's a horrible model that I believe is entrenched by the big boys having influence with those in power.<p>How come this doesn't happen in the US, where copying does take place, but less directly and quickly? It's not like quickly copying a startup idea is illegal, and anyone can claim they've been working on something similar to a new idea for a while. Is it perhaps because there's a diversity of channels and forums by which new startups can market themselves, whereas in China everyone uses Baidu/QQ/Renren/Weibo and some of those sites possibly block out competitors' marketing?<p>I don't know, just thinking out loud and looking for more-informed opinions.",1332391417

There are so many essential features (no matter how simple the site is) that are missing. What if someone guesses my URL? What if I don't want anyone else to see my note(s)? I tried signing up and got ""Thank You for signing up. We will notify you when user-specific features become available.""<p>2. The ability to edit other peoples notes can create value with collaboration but it needs to be real time. If I open a note in another tab, edit it then switch back to the first tab and edit it I've just overwritten everything that the other edits contained. This is a big problem.<p>3. (Personal opinion with no real justification beyond personal preference) why have you put adverts on this? For me if you're building something that is ""simple"" and then putting adverts on it seems a contradiction, now instead of a basic notepad I have a basic notepad with a flash advert distracting me from the actual purpose of the site: typing. Yes, if you had large costs to cover it would be understandable, but you don't.<p>This isn't a bad start, the design is nice but ""simple"" is not synonymous for ""lack of features"", it means something is easy to use but has enough depth to make it usable, this doesn't. A very basic revision history is necessary at the very least, although personally I'd use one of the already existing text tools (pastebin, pastie, hastebin) or for collaboration google docs.<p>Personally I think if you were to expand this into having real time collaboration, customisation of permissions (using the ""account"" system?) and revision history it would become something worth having bookmarked :)<p>Edit: seems this is just a resubmit from a couple of days ago, not sure why it seems to match the previous comments, have you made any changes? <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3719057"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3719057</a>",1332389982

How you <i>choose</i> to act, what conclusions you draw about the other person, are the important things in this context.<p>Sexism would be if your attraction influenced your professional behavior towards your prospective client in any way, negatively or positively.<p>As you hinted, being able to be less distracted by an attractive figure is a matter of self-mastery, which often comes more easily with maturity, and to some degree familiarity. But a modern gentleman knows to treat others as <i>persons</i> first, not as sexual beings, especially in a professional context.",1332389374

They accidentally stumble onto the site, almost always from Google, and click out to a merchant before they even realize they're on a comparison shopping engine.  There are like three guys who actually type the URL of a shopping engine into their address bar and intentionally search on that site for the product they're looking for.  This holds across basically all of the top comparison shopping engines.  Their direct traffic is almost non-existant, and they are utterly dependent upon search and paid traffic to survive.<p>And it's all the users' fault.  The various engines have spent nearly a decade and literally millions of dollars trying to figure out how to get people to come to them when they want to buy something, and they just don't want to.  Users can't deal with remembering a <i>second</i> URL to go to to find something on the internet.  They want to go to Google and type in what they're looking for and find it.",1332389183

All the men, myself included, treat them with respect... meaning, we tease the shit out of them.<p>To do otherwise would exclude them from the team. Have you ever seen a cohesive group that didn't joke around? A tiny fraction of the jabs traded by men are HR-approved... if we filtered that for the women who work with us, we would be treating them as if they're too weak or too sensitive to be a part of the group.<p>So instead, we treat them no differently than any other team member. If one of the other coders were to arrive unusually dressed up, I would absolutely comment on it, regardless of whether it's a suit or a dress, but one of the ladies would probably beat me to it. Frankly, the women push the HR line harder than any of us guys, and we love them for it.<p>If you find that people are consistently telling you to ""lighten up,"" whether you're male or female, you shouldn't assume that the world is conspiring to put you down.

3738314,comment,3737856,3737856,15,0,Terretta,,,"I think his point is the least of the problems with magazines.  In fact, I strongly disagree that fast moving blog-style content is a good thing for magazines.  I want to wait for the right mix of browsability and depth, and I want a ""periodic"" relationship with my periodicals.<p>I subscribe to a variety of magazines in print and iPad editions.  Wired, Mens Health, Economist, Car and Driver, National Geographic, and Popular Photography, to name a few.<p>I haven't opened a print edition in over a year.  That said, I also am not opening these on the iPad, except when stuck on a plane waiting for the flight attendant to finish his seatbelt dance.<p>Why not?<p>1. Every time there's an iOS update, the apps forget who I am, and I have to re-register.  This usually results in me just ignoring magazines for a quarter or two.<p>2. They notify of new content, but do not pre-download it.  They're huge, 500MB for a magazine, but I have a 64GB iPad -- a lot more memory than patience.  When I launch the magazine and see I'll have to wait 5 minutes to download the latest issue, I close it again, and that magazine is lost to me.<p>3. <i>Some</i> make me scroll around too much. Economist does not.  Economist is actually even easier to navigate on the iPad than in print.  Of the magazines I do get, GQ is the worst at trying to leverage ""new media"".  I have to paw at the screen 20 times to skim one factoid page, and it's ridiculous.  Popular Photography is similar, and I have finished issues only to realize I'd missed entire sections.<p>4. The pricing model is stupid, and too many magazines don't give a digital subscription along with the print.  I can see why most want their print circulation numbers higher -- they're a whole different set of ads and ad pricing. But to have ""digital only"" subscriptions cost 4x the wholesale print price is ridiculous.  Every magazine I mentioned, I buy in print, copy the subscriber ID off the label, and get the digital.  I chuck the printed copy or leave it in the company lobby.  It's a waste, but when it costs $5/year for print+digital instead of $50 for just digital, I suspect I'm doing exactly what they want.  If, however, the publishers that don't have this kind of offer were to let me subscribe digitally for a reasonable price (no more than $1/month since I still have to see the ads and they don't have to handle printing and mailing it), I'd subscribe to a lot more titles.<p>So, these are the problems, and they're fixable.  What he is proposing, however, I disagree with, strongly.  Fast moving content is not what magazines are for.<p>DPReview is a fantastic photo blog, but it's a fundamentally different experience than browsing an issue of Popular Photography.  The issue has a theme, a connective binding that ties all its articles together.  There's a comfortable familiarity with the voice of the editor.  You enjoy a sense of expectation when waiting for the next issue.  You go back and revisit a prior month's issue when you're considering a certain kind of gear.  These are all very different from the ephemera of the journo-blogs.  Each has its place.  Blogs replaced the daily newspaper, essentially giving me my Tech section, my Startup News section, instead of whatever my local paper had.  But magazines and newspapers coexisted for over a century and it's because they're fundamentally different experiences.<p>With magazines on the iPad, it's fantastic to travel with 50 magazines at hand, not taking any space.  The color images in National Geographic are spectacular, and I don't miss the paper edition. (Mine are all still in their plastic.)  The article typography and minimalist layout on Economist is a joy to read.<p>When done wrong, I can't be bothered to wait for a download, to paw around to find the end of a story, or to pay 5x as much as I would for print.<p>When done right, I'm convinced these digital editions are the future of periodicals, and blogs are the future of newspapers.",1332388949

9589914,comment,9587947,9588640,0,0,toomuchtodo,,,"> As far as I can tell, Uber&#x27;s argument is that its drivers are independent contractors, and if anybody&#x27;s breaking the law it&#x27;s the drivers and not Uber (because, frankly, that&#x27;s always Uber&#x27;s argument).<p>I have a fun experiment. Let&#x27;s ask the IRS if Uber&#x27;s drivers truly are &quot;independent contractors&quot; as they argue, despite the regulations they impose on drivers which are surprisingly close to regulations you&#x27;d impose on an employee.<p>This has happened before, with costly consequences (Fedex Ground attempted to (illegally) label its drivers as independent contracts: <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/10/23/how-fedex-is-trying-to-save-the-business-model-that-saved-it-millions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/10/23/h...</a>",1432317562

The news undoubtedly came as a gut-punch to the VR faithful. The lack of universal platform support means that any dreams people might have had about VR for the masses will have to be put on hold — either that or it’s time to look elsewhere for salvation.<p>Oculus isn&#x27;t the only VR on the market. I&#x27;m sure other VR companies will support UNIX. If they don&#x27;t - someone will fill that market. Why? Because it&#x27;s a market. Markets that have no competition will inevitably obtain competition if it is profitable to fill the market.<p>>At least we can stop deluding ourselves about one thing. The Oculus Rift is for games — period; full stop<p>The two largest markets for VR are Gaming and Porn. Education probably comes as a close 3rd. I don&#x27;t see why anyone would have ever thought otherwise; unless they don&#x27;t understand economics. Two of the largest markets within entertainment will obviously be the markets targeted with a new technology. Wait until it takes over the major markets before expecting it to fit any niche markets.<p>>foreshadowed GamerGate<p>Have to shoehorn that in there somewhere somehow. It&#x27;s a requirement if you write anything and are from SanFran it seems. Is anyone else sick of seeing this shoehorned in everywhere?<p>>Oculus has made a choice which ultimately will benefit the industry — by all means go forth and make VR gaming a mainstream category!<p>Does the author mean the VR industry or the Gaming industry at this point? It&#x27;s difficult to tell.<p>> — but in the short term they have broadened the gap between game developers and everyone else<p>How? No really... how?

9589857,comment,9588175,9588175,0,0,fit2rule,,,"As a 45 year old with 30 years of experience in the computer industry, such titles interest me, immensely.<p>I grew up with Unix.<p>I remember the days when Unix was a seriously advanced topic, available only to the elite privileged (adults) who were granted access to it as a technological resource only through machinations that were out of my scope of influence, as a 13 year old learning computing in 1983.  It was a vast mystery.<p>It was only with great effort on my part that access was eventually granted in the form of a login over a slow modem.  That was enough for me to move to the next phase.<p>Then, it was a mystery in terms of taxology.  I had a near-infinite, seemingly overwhelming number of things to learn - more than what was in my high school curriculum, more than my little home 8-bit computer could teach me, more .. it seemed at the time .. than all the books on my shelf.<p>Well, it was only a few years - actually probably less than 10 months - until I was able to grasp at least a <i>little bit</i> of the subject, and do something with it.  That was enough to propel me into the professional sphere - where I was able to move from a clueless teenager into the clued-up programmer zone.<p>And then (late 80&#x27;s) it became a game of &quot;which Unix do you want to know?&quot;, and that game was as thorny as any other.  I chose Risc/OS (from MIPS, pre-SGI) and it worked out: I gained my own machine (physical hardware) as a result of commercial delivery of products - a few files of .c/.h - which I&#x27;d managed to build as a result of eager learning applied to real application.<p>And then: Linux.  This changed the world completely, at least for me at the time.  When I first saw Linus&#x27; post on the minix-list, announcing his sharing of work I thought completely inapproachable and beyond the horizon, I immediately applied myself to catching up.  And then, through the 90&#x27;s, the commercial applications of these skills gave me an even deeper understanding of the subject - and Unix became less of a mystery and more of a resource for living.  And so it was: for a decade I built Unix software, like no other, which resulted in many great things for many great people.<p>Then, we flipped the century bit, and Unix - in spite of all the predictions from industry experts - was still with us. It didn&#x27;t just go away because of pop-culture desires and mores, it was seriously entrenched.  That 80&#x27;s decision seemed all the more wise in 2001, when it became clear to me that Unix was not going away.<p>So I kept at it.  I coded all I could.  I got a tiBook - astounded, but content nevertheless, that Apple (of all companies) was producing a portable Unix workstation - something that I&#x27;d dreamed of for over a decade. And there it was, the tiBook.  So I&#x27;ve upgraded my way from there, to my current extremely satisfying device (MBP Retina) .. and beyond that, even beyond my wildest teenage dreams: here we are today - I carry around a Unix workstation in my pocket.<p>Its my primary means of communication, just like I always knew it would be.  It does all the things that I used to do with the Risc/OS pizza box.  It does it in a way that makes total sense - a simple interface, like the embodiment of the holy pipe, but at my fingertips.<p>It has been a challenge, a fantasy, and a real desire to see Unix become what it is today - but its also been a privilege.  I think that all of my fellow hackers who professed faith in the technology, must feel the same - at least those who have watched it happen over decades.  Truly, a unique human experience.<p>And therefore I&#x27;m really glad to see this article.  It has been very enlightening - and as well, personally satisfying - to see that others recognize the power of this technology, which took decades to become the force of power that it is today.",1432316918

Most had garages, some had driveways but no garage. Now I suspect that we are unusual in being a two-adult household with one car. A neighbor across the way has four vehicles--three cars and a pickup truck, all of which they must park on the street.<p>The increase in cars per household means that for a good ways in every direction, any side street will have cars parked on both sides. Two ordinary sized American cars can pass each other in what is left, but drivers usually find it safer to look for an unparked space where one can pull over a little. Twenty-five miles per hour does not feel slow on these streets (particularly from the right front seat).<p>You are completely correct about the residents wishing to slow things down.

9589791,comment,9588547,9588547,0,0,snowwrestler,,,"> Bearings work to help one surface slide along another by minimizing the points of friction between the two. Imagine sliding a book across a desk. There&#x27;s friction at all points where the book is touching the surface. But if you put that book on top of some pencils, there&#x27;s only friction where the book touches the pencils and where the pencils touch the desk. Suddenly that book is practically racing across the table if you so much as nudge it.<p>This description of why bearings work is terrible. If the advantage is just reducing surface area, then that would be a runner: pushing the book along the pencils long-ways. This actually does not reduce friction, since the equation for the force of friction does not include a term for surface area. (There are some real-world exceptions--runners on ice for example.)<p>Bearings work because they replace sliding friction with static friction. Static friction is actually higher than sliding friction (otherwise things would never stop sliding), but it never comes into play because the load-bearing surfaces don&#x27;t slide relative to one another. This is also why antilock brakes tend to reduce stopping distances for cars.<p>Bearing cages do experience sliding friction, but not on load-bearing surfaces. Since the normal force is therefore much lower, so is amount of sliding friction.<p>It&#x27;s true that in theory, eliminating the cage would reduce overall friction in a bearing. However bearings have to live in the real world, where materials are ductile or friable. Small indentations in the load-bearing race will only be durable if the load at that point is well under the yield strength of the materials. Otherwise the balls or the race will just deform and lose the advantage.",1432316188

These initial folks will pepper you with feature requests while still paying you money for what you&#x27;ve got, which <i>can</i> give you feedback about which complexities you&#x27;re missing that you really need to implement. If you choose which things to implement carefully, you end up making your product more useful to larger customers and you&#x27;ll start closing some larger deals. (E.g. $500/mo.) Rinse and repeat and before too long you&#x27;ve got a product with all the bells and whistles and you&#x27;re closing enterprise deals. (E.g. $2,500+/mo.) The numbers here are all relative, but the point is that the smaller customers end up subsidizing the development of what becomes an enterprise product.<p>(I think the advantage this approach has over the one you&#x27;ve suggested is that the product is always capable of making money even from the very beginning, just on a smaller scale at first. I think this is a critical feedback mechanism so that folks know whether what they&#x27;re developing is actually useful to folks.)",1432315534

9589727,comment,9583196,9586268,0,0,stygiansonic,,,"Consider the effect of this - effectively this is saying the company should put in a huge limit SELL limit order at the IPO price (&quot;Limit SELL 100,000,000, @ $10.00&quot;) and leave it open all day. This would almost certainly bias the price movement on the stock downward because:<p>1) In order for the price to rise above $10.00, there would have to be enough buyers out there to fill the entire limit order. There&#x27;s no guarantee of that.<p>2) Consequently, if the first few buyers start to trade their stock and the price falls below $10.00, the initial &quot;IPO Limit Order&quot; could never get filled. Essentially, the company does not know how much capital they would raise.<p>The standard underwriting/IPO process aims to remove this risk. It&#x27;s not really removed, however, and really just transferred to the underwriters. However, the underwriters have better ability to deal with/mitigate the risk because of their abilities in this area. (Gauging investor sentiment through roadshows, use of greenshoe/reverse greenshoe options, etc.)<p>The idea is that the IPO price is set conservatively to ensure the underwriters don&#x27;t take a loss. This &quot;spread&quot; between the IPO price and the &quot;true&quot; price is part of the fee they take. (I&#x27;m not arguing whether it&#x27;s a lot of money, just providing the details) The key part of this is that it&#x27;s hard to know what the &quot;true&quot; price will be on IPO day, and hence, what your IPO price should be. It&#x27;s the underwriters&#x27; job to help determine this.<p>Note that in your example, you could just set the IPO/Limit price so low that you know the entire sell order will get filled. But this naturally leads to the question: What should I set the IPO price to, to ensure the most amount of capital (&quot;don&#x27;t leave any money on the table&quot;) while still ensuring the order is filled? Again, this is a service that the underwriters would provide and is something that most companies probably don&#x27;t know how to do.<p>(Note that the situation in (1) and (2) is also why you would never want to put in a huge standing limit order; it will push the price away from you and effectively acts as an option for other traders to &quot;lean on&quot;)",1432315334
9589725,comment,9588128,9588985,0,0,floppydisk,,,"A bit more pushback on both points.<p>> I would not wish startup lifestyle on anyone and I don&#x27;t advocate for that. I may have been unclear, but the engineers in question are exactly the kind of people who don&#x27;t need to take outside investments and are able to bootstrap (as in use their own funds and rely on immediate/eventual cashflow).<p>The provide data is gross income, not net. Subtract federal and state taxes and you&#x27;re at a more realistic figure for net income. Then subtract cost of living (i.e. property taxes, utilities) etc., and you&#x27;re at a much lower figure for net expendable income than the numbers here. Your argument also assumes they&#x27;re in a position personally to take on the associated risks of leaving stable employment and pursue a &quot;moonshot&quot; relying on savings and hopeful future cashflow. They might not be there. Also, running a business/organization is a far cry from slinging code and architecting and requires a different temperament, personality, and skill set. The individuals we&#x27;re speaking of might be lacking in those or the desire to pursue such an activity. They might rather solve problems than deal with GAAP vs non-GAAP compliance issues, HR policies, marketing, or revenue generation. All things a corporate leader must address that an engineer solving problems might only ever have to address tangentially.<p>> They would have the independence, resources and authority to create self-sustaining social enterprises ( maximizing social impact rather than profits for external shareholders.), rallying supporters around their mission.<p>There are a lot of assumptions rolled into that sentence that I want to unpack.<p>First, what you&#x27;re describing sounds incredibly similar to a non-profit and we&#x27;re swimming in them. Why would engineers do a better job at building organizations that maximize social impact than people who spend their entire lives doing nothing but? The only comparative advantages I see are (possible) money and engineering acumen.<p>Second, how are we defining &quot;social impact&quot;? That&#x27;s an incredibly nebulous term and one could argue that being part of a business generates social impact. Think of profit and revenue as an indicator of value provided. The more people buying and using my services generally implies I&#x27;m providing something of value. Ergo, pursuit of a profit and providing services people will expend money to pay for might be indicative of activities having a &quot;social impact&quot;. People are willing to expend money for your solution to $PROBLEM over the possible alternatives indicating you&#x27;re providing some value. As an engineer if I help the company solve a problem that lets them scale services to increase the number of people who can use it, offer new features, etc. I&#x27;m increasing the corporation&#x27;s value proposition and providing a service to people to help solve their problems and meet their needs, I would argue that is a positive social impact.<p>Third, what is a &quot;self-sustaining social enterprise&quot;? Generally, I&#x27;ve heard those called corporations and they resemble normal every day businesses. What is different about your notion other than they&#x27;re privately held? They&#x27;ll still need to generate a profit in order to grow and increase revenues to meet growing payroll and expenses. I&#x27;m having a hard time understanding how you&#x27;re seeing social impact as different from bringing in $$$ in exchange for providing a solution to problems.<p>The other assumption here I think we need to address is the notion that the individuals possess the charisma to rally people to the cause. You&#x27;re describing someone with an incredibly charismatic personality that draws people in, that&#x27;s a significant minority of the population. Why is that skill set attributed to engineers making big figures? Generally, I&#x27;ve found the opposite to be true, the charismatics and visionaries tend to not be engineers -- engineering is generally too rigid for the charismatics and the people stuff can be too squishy and shades of grey for the engineering types.<p>> Seeding acquired knowledge back into the ecosystem is an orthogonal/complementary activity and depends more on their employer. I am not sure we can encourage the engineers to do that. Also, while sharing innovation &quot;blueprints&quot; is definitely a net positive for the ecosystem, I think it disproportionally benefits the megacorps, while indies and middle-sized tech businesses are being slowly squeezed out. The web is becoming more centralized and I am wary of that trend.<p>The open source culture is booming compared to what it was a few years ago. More people are involved in OSS and more companies are pulling in OSS software to solve their problems. Is the system perfect? No. Will it ever be perfect? No. Is it better than what it has been or could have been? Heck yes.<p>How does it overly benefit megacorps? Yes, they might have the resources to pursue implementations faster, but a ton of the innovation on those systems is happening at the small to medium sized corporate level where the engineers have the freedom to innovate. I&#x27;m missing the link between the web being centralized and small to medium sized businesses getting squeezed. Generally, if there&#x27;s a &quot;squeeze&quot; it&#x27;s the small to mid sized businesses getting bought out by megacorps to fill needs, which, is usually an encouraged outcome for some of them because they aren&#x27;t going to &quot;get big&quot; otherwise and scale up to the point where they have more than minute impact. Being inside megacorp gives them the opportunity to tap resources they would lack otherwise and get their tech into way more people&#x27;s hands. I&#x27;ll raise the case of the Storm processor. It started as a side project at Backtype and become Nathan Martz&#x27;s full time gig when Twitter bought them out. It&#x27;s one of the &quot;big&quot; open source data processors on the market and they&#x27;re still innovating on it.<p>Ideally there&#x27;s a balanced ecosystem. Big corporations have resources and manpower, but are prone to inertia and lack responsiveness in the face of new technology<i>. Smaller corps lack resources and manpower but try to get an edge through creating new technology or adopting it, proving it out, and extending it. Big corps finally come around and either adopt the new tech along with the rest of the people in the ecosystem or buy out small corp to get the people who built or are extremely experienced with the tech/platform/framework. These people then get the resources + manpower to work on their projects. Eventually some of them get bored or hampered by the inertia, drop out of megacorp, and start or return another small corp and repeat the process. That&#x27;s the trend I see playing out over and over again.<p></i>Yes, there ARE exceptions to the rule. I.E. LinkedIn + Kafka etc.",1432315312

Personally, I am beginning to replace Dropbox with BitTorrent Sync and keeping a close eye on syncthing.net.

If an employee has a 0.05% stake in a company that pulls in $100m/year in profits, that&#x27;s an extra $50k if you do straight-up profit sharing.

Our microservices are currently listening to everything and only taking action on things they care about. As such, they are also storing data about things they care about. This makes it so that no single datastore is a bottle neck in a distributed architecture. This doesn&#x27;t mean we don&#x27;t have a centralize DB, but in the heat of operation it doesn&#x27;t rely on a centralized DB. Using event sourcing makes it very easy to take this distributed data and store it in a consumable way for reporting, etc.<p>Another thing being it&#x27;s a much different metric you have to worry about than traditional apps. Instead of worrying about load on a server, your main concern is messages processed per time frame. This can vary depending on what the service is doing, but in general you can simply monitor RabbitMQ&#x27;s queue processing rate to determine if you need to scale a particular service or not.<p>It&#x27;s a bit hard to debug some concurrency problems, but is normally solved by asking: &quot;Who&#x27;s responsibility is this?&quot; and then adjusting who emits what.<p>They mention planning out events; we go a bit further and use json schema to describe exactly what is expected in that event. We actually have a dedicated development microservice that simply listens to all events and validates them against the json schema and records/notifies what events (and the source) is not being compliant.<p>In the beginning of development, our throughput was dreadful, but now that we have all the tools in place, adding a new service or handler of an event in a service is incredibly fast.",1432315024

He only got his second bowl win in a good while last year, after many failures.<p>Again with UF, I am assuming you are talking about 2013 when they lost to GA Southern. The problem is, they lost to a lot of teams that year (4-8). They were a fundamentally bad team in the midst of a five game losing streak when they lost to GA Southern (not to take away from what the Eagles accomplished).<p>That GA Southern loss wasn&#x27;t because of their offensive scheme. It was more about a team feeling that they failed fantastically, that some of their coaches were going to be removed, and that it&#x27;s going to be seen as a lost season. The only two offensively strong teams they played wore them out (Missou 36-17 and FSU 37-7). Throw in a loss to an awful Miami (21-16) and an even worse Vandy (34-17!?!?).",1432314094

Perl is totally a serious language. I do most of my work in it, in fact. I qualify it with &quot;serious language&quot; because when I say it&#x27;s one of the slowest serious languages, it&#x27;s no fair to counter that by pointing out somebody&#x27;s hobby implementation of Lispcheme that&#x27;s a hundred time slower.<p>&quot;In its class of languages Perl is one of the fastest.&quot;<p>Well... I suppose... since essentially all original C-interpreter implementations of the 1990s-style dynamic scripting languages have performance within about 20% of each other, that&#x27;s not <i>false</i>... but the marketing-style implication that Perl is the <i>fastest</i> certainly is false. (Also LuaJIT is way faster, but does &quot;compromise&quot; relative to some Perl features to get there.) Drop the &quot;C-interpreter&quot; clause and Perl&#x27;s in real trouble... Javascript isn&#x27;t the C-speed language it sometimes gets presented as but JIT&#x27;ed JS really will handily beat Perl, and PyPy is... weirdly complicated from a performance perspective.<p>The point is still that talking about Perl as a perfomant language on almost any measure is... very weird. It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s possible to name several serious languages which are <i>as</i> slow, but not one that clearly slower.",1432314060

Have they genuinely changed or are they just being forced by their new market positions to behave better? None of your examples point to a MS doing things for the right reasons and trying to regain trust, they point to a MS that ran out of options. I don&#x27;t trust a dog to not run away while he&#x27;s locked in a kennel, I trust him to not run away because <i>he has no choice</i>.<p>What happens if they gain a dominant or monopoly position in something again, are we just supposed to trust that they won&#x27;t behave badly once their market pressure is gone? A new CEO and a company the size of MS won&#x27;t magically change their company culture overnight (especially with a CEO who was previously a longstanding MS employee who participated in past wrongdoings).

Not only that, but while Amazon must seek economies of scale and efficiency at every point of the distribution network, Google can leverage the irrationality and inefficiency inherent in a distribution network composed of individual retail outlets.  In the same way that eBay doesn't have to worry about packing up and shipping millions of disparate items, it just takes a fee off the top for delivering the sale.<p>I wonder about the benefits versus the costs to stores.  Though you can already walk into a retail store and Google up an item on your phone to see if it's cheaper somewhere else... and you can already search for reviews of an item online, etc.  I guess what is interesting here is that Google is delivering the physicality of a store to your screen; so conceivably some walk-ins that might have occurred just to check a place out will now occur online.  On the flip side, turning every retail outlet into a 24 hour business has got to have some appeal.<p>Going really crazy with this, looking ahead to Google's driverless cars getting approval to run without a safety driver on board, you could Store View to your favorite cafe, put in your order for the caffeinated beverage of your choice, have the Google car drop by, the barista puts the drinks in a carrier in the back seat, the car picks up some Chinese food, energy bars, and a pair of earphones for you on the way back, you get a text telling you to go outside to pick everything up, you scan your GoogleID into the car, get your stuff, head back into the office and prepare to code all night.  If you are so inclined, you drop a few bucks into the online tip jars of the coffee shop and restaurant.

You need to concentrate on making it work well for 1 demographic, as he says, but keep an eye out that you aren't excluding others or making meaningless decisions that hurt your product on the global scale.<p>If you concentrate on ""indie bands and their music videos"", sure, you'll hit the sweet spot for them.  But you might have decided that limiting uploads to 8 minutes made sense because no music video will be longer than that.  It makes sense from other standpoints, too, because it's easier to store, stream, and otherwise handle smaller videos.<p>But what about indie movie producers?  Or kids with cats?  Or ...  Well, the billions of other video producers out there.<p>A friend of mine was recently upset that YouTube was limiting him to 15 minutes.  He wanted to upload gameplay recordings, and splitting them into 15 minute chunks was a real pain.<p>Notch's Ludum Dare coding videos would also not have been allowed, and they were excellent watching.

The author doesn't seem to introduce the concept of training/testing datasets which absolutely critical to obtaining any reasonable model.  So I don't buy the author's thesis that economic models are always wrong.<p>The solution to the hypothetical problem posed in the article is to separate the historical dataset into training and testing groups.  The models should be generated while only 'seeing' the training data.  You will, as the author mentioned, get many models that appear to fit the data.  Most of these models will be garbage.<p>The fun part is when the testing data is introduced against the many models generated above.  Most of the models will completely bomb, but a handful may actually predict the previously 'unseen' testing data with high accuracy.  Those few models which pass the testing stage are the ones worth their salt.<p>Due to the self-aware nature of the markets, successful models probably will not be true indefinitely, but it's very possible they may be true long enough to be profitable.  The less known your successful models are, the longer they will be successful predictors of the market.  Hence why successful quant funds are notoriously secretive with their approaches.

Example: a Amex customer tells amex 'I never paid company X money'.  Amex looks and doesn't see any payment to company X but a payment from Stripe which aggregated payments from Company X.  This creates problems which typically yield in Amex refunding the customer but taking the hit because they can't prove it to the aggregator.

The reality we have today is, the first practitioner to think of a given problem can straightforwardly produce, using standard techniques, a solution to that problem, and patent it.  It's considered an invention because the solution, let's suppose, didn't previously exist, but that's <i>only</i> because no one had attempted to solve that particular problem before.  The patent teaches nothing new; another practitioner, unaware of the patent, coming upon the same problem, is likely to solve it in a similar way and with no great difficulty.<p>I'm not saying all software patents are in this category, but I think the great majority of them are.  And the reasons are not hard to find.  First, software is, by its nature, a fantastically generative medium.  All that is required to build a machine of any degree of complexity is to write down, in the mathematical formalism called ""code"", a sufficiently precise specification of how that machine should work.<p>And secondly, as has been lamented many times, when the PTO first started to grant patents on software under orders from the U.S. Supreme Court (in Diamond v. Diehr), they had no software experts.  Even now, as I understand, they tend to hire new graduates who have little industry experience.  What's more, patent examiners have no incentive to reject patents on the basis of obviousness; that's not how their performance is measured.<p>These two factors together are a recipe for disaster.",1319649352

I am only sharing them because I feel that the ""experts"" do not have enough evidence in their field to make what they say too much more authoritative. Please take it with a grain of salt.<p>Obsessive thoughts are associated with OCD just as much as with depression. A lot of them happen because of pathways in the brain get strengthened over time so that a trigger will cause a particular thought pattern to occur. The triggers can be many different things, or a combination, from diet related, to amount of sleep, to words you heard and your subconscious brain started thinking about, to concepts you were exposed to. For example almost all of us have obsessive sexual fantasies which get triggered by exposure to porn. We have been conditioned by our society and advertising to have various cravings, etc.<p>Now, if you want control over these -- it will be a LONG TERM process because your brain gets wired like ""hardware"", some pathways get stronger over time and you can't re-wire it instantly. (Unless of course you are Phineas Gage, which you don't want.)<p>There is no 100% solution that works for everyone obviously. Sometimes you can't get from here to there. But if you use the model above, you can almost always make a number of serious changes in what you think about.<p>Try to identify your triggers by paying attention to specific things that happen before you get the obsessive thoughts. Try to isolate the parts of your mind that are engaged by these things. What commonality do these have? Learning more about your triggers helps you avoid them while you re-condition your brain.<p>Look at your expectations, which are internal pressures you put on yourself. You set yourself up for disappointment when something doesn't happen, when you find yourself in a certain state where the thing you expected didn't happen. This is a massive trigger, because it is set by yourself, and you self-identify with it. The worst triggers are the ones that you identify with having caused yourself.<p>Work on breaking bad associations. When I you to complete this two word phrase: ""peanut-"" do you think ""-butter""? If this is negative to you, then try to introduce a competing association that doesn't give you negative triggers, and doesn't cause obsessive thoughts. For example, ""peanut-taste"". It certainly is a silly example (think of whatever is in your ACTUAL situation, it may not involve just two words but entire thoughts). But the point is, rather than saying ""don't think about the pink elephant"" and hoping it'll work, you try to associate one or more competing pathways with your triggers, and eventually, through the competition, you may remove the pathway that leads to suicidal thoughts or other obsessive thoughts.<p>Also you can set up competing pathways that lead OUT of your obsessive thoughts. These may be things you feel strongly about, such as your kids, pleasant associations from your childhood, or things you really want to accomplish in your life. Once you find yourself already thinking about suicidal thoughts, find ways out that worked for you, and write them down. They may lose their power over time, so it is important to find good reasons to believe in them. Notice this matches exactly what you did with the ""Get busy living, or get busy dying."" You used to say, ""Suicidal thoughts? Stop thinking about them or just do it already."" And it used to snap you out, but in the long term it just lost its authority just like anything else that fails to deliver on its promise for a long period of time. The best way is to have this combination of<p>competing pathways that AVOID leading into obsessive / depressing thoughts<p>and<p>competing pathways that lead OUT of obsessive / depressing thoughts<p>work together. Because, if you find that your episodes of having obsessive / depressing thoughts get more and more rare, you will find that you can TRUST the competing pathways to get you out, and unlike ""stopping believing"" (as you described above), you and your unconscious mind will trust them and follow them, and eventually you will minimize the problem.<p>Also, people are motivated by contrasts. When you have too much of X, or you get tired / bored of it, you start wanting an alternative to X, or perhaps even ""not X"". This is what can cause, for example, people who have everything to go and try something completely wacky, that would leave others saying, ""what were they thinking?"" This is only somewhat related, but if you want to motivate yourself to do something, artificially hold yourself back from the thing you want to do. You will feel the absence and the space and will be glad when given the chance to start doing it.<p>Finally, HABITS in the real world affects how often triggers come up. The ultimate prevention is by instilling better habits. As one example, some people with chronic joint pain avoid wheat products and find that their chronic joint pain goes away. In general, I would say getting lots of sleep and physical exercise -- especially assuming you are on the computer a lot, since you are here -- will effect positive PHYSICAL changes and can once again be something you can come to trust as a method to have a better life. This trust is important, and if you break your ""good habit"" out of laziness, your results won't be as pronounced and your trust won't be as strong. You have to let the habit earn its trust.

3159481,comment,3157208,3157208,1,0,jeffdechambeau,,,"Morality tends to be governed by two views: you can either judge an action by its outcomes (consequentialism), or by its motivating principles (deontology).<p>From the consequentialist perspective, Walt's pretty clearly a bad guy: meth is a brutal drug with very little social upside. Sure he's able to bring about good for his family, but I'm sure there's a whole network of people who's lives are worse off because of his work. Overall he's probably created more bad than good in the world. Because meth tends to tear you down in the long run, I don't think it's fair to say he's responsible for the goodness of the high that his customers feel, as in the end it's a destructive addiction and not a recreation.<p>A fair response to this is that if Walt didn't cook the meth, someone else would, so there's the same amount of ""bad"" whether he does it or not, so why not take the money and run? I think the simple answer is that something doesn't magically become not-bad if someone else is willing to do it. Walt can still cook meth, but it's hard to say it's ethical from this first point of view.<p>From the deontological point of view, it's a bit murky. If you boil this down the view to its core, it's a moral test that's summarized as: ""I can only do this if I'm ok with other people doing it too.""<p>So, has Walt acted in ways that he (or we) would be alright with people doing broadly? Here's a couple spins on what he's doing:<p>1. ""A man should be able to do whatever he needs to to provide for his family."" While I might feel like I should be able to do whatever I need to to feed my wife and kids (provided they existed), I clearly wouldn't want someone else exploiting my family to feed theirs. So this fails the test and is immoral.<p>2. ""I can profit off of goods that are addictive and destructive."" This one is tricky, unless you're a libertarian and think that everyone is free to make their own good or bad decisions and that they own the consequences. I'm sure people will advocate this (and I assume the linked article will too, given the line ""rational decision to provide a product to people whom have voluntarily decided to consume it"") but I think it lacks nuance and legitimacy. Nonetheless, what Walt is doing would at least be internally consistent so long as he's okay with other people selling equally bad goods, and making them available to, for instance, his son. The argument here is the generic one about why stuff should be illegal or not.<p>So where does this leave us? I don't think there's a strong case to be made that Walt is a moral guy. No matter which of the two lenses we use, his actions look pretty bad. But I think that's what makes the character and the show so compelling: Our morals are an abstraction that we've placed upon the world to make it easier to navigate, and he's moved into a darker world where these rules don't matter, and what's more is that he's thriving.<p>I think that's the hook, that somehow this meek and mild guy who played by the rules his entire life was able to shed them entirely and find himself completely at home--and the audience is along for the ride, assuring themselves that they could thrive in a world without rules just as Walt has.",1319648987

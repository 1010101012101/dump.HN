After all if you can't be <i>contacted</i> you really can't be identified, and the universal way of contacting someone online is through email.<p>Now, you should definitely try and provide some redundancy (store multiple email addresses, long living sessions, whatever) and make your anonymous/unauthenticated/drive-by user experience stellar.  But when push comes to shove if you can't send them a ""forgot your username/password/open-id/samoflange"" email, you've lost that user.<p>(anecdote: I've had the same primary email for >7 years)",1310687979

2765710,comment,2765014,2765415,1,0,timwiseman,,,"It would be hard to do this for a coal company because few coal companies deal too directly with the consumer, and even people who buy charcoal to grill with at home often do not get too attached to one brand since charcoal is close to being a commodity (yes, there are some people with strong opinions on this, but most people do not have them).<p>But I suspect you will find this in every field where a consumer will be highly invested in the product, and especially in fields where their use of the product can be publicly seen, and even more so when it is publicly seen and thought (rightly or wrongly) to say something about the user.  Many people are very proud of the type of car they drive.  Most people who ride motorcycles have very strong opinions about the different brands and styles available.  Many people (certainly not all, but many) who drive a Prius do so as much because they think it says something about them as for any other reason.<p>As others have said, people will find different forms of tribalism in just about any public activity.",1310687951

2765707,comment,2765318,2765427,1,0,JoshTriplett,,,"That's a common opinion, yes.  Some users prefer to actually take advantage of their screen width to read more content at a time.  It also proves particularly convenient when trying to skim for particular information without reading everything.<p>Part of the justification for using narrow columns relates to the difficulty of finding the starting point of the next line when your eyes jump a large distance to the left.  That advice applies quite well to books, and much less well to more structured content.  For instance, on Hacker News, most comments don't have a wall of text with no paragraph breaks, and comments have strong delineation, so a narrow text width doesn't actually help.<p>That said, if you have the type of content for which a narrow text width does help (which TechCrunch sometimes does), please don't limit it to a specific pixel width; please use em instead, so that the width gets larger with the font size.  That way, when users hit Ctrl-+ to override a site's smaller-than-the-browser's-default font size, the site will show about the same amount of text on each line, rather than producing narrower lines as the font grows.",1310687933

Maybe you haven't met enough of these programmers, but there's a shit ton of them in the corporate world.<p>>  If there isn't a term for something, you just make one and say what you mean by it. That's what we've always done and it's what programmers not under the influence of ""design patterns"" always still do.<p>Yes, and it doesn't work well when you don't have a common vocabulary; you spend all your time trying to grok their little custom names for everything.<p>Everything else you said is what happens when people mis-apply patterns and think they're code templates, they're not and were never intended to be.",1310687908

Hotmail and Yahoo both had much bigger shares.<p>It's difficult to imagine an authentication system that doesn't have some kind of centralized mechanism for making sure identities aren't duplicated. In this case, delegating that to a combination of two existing technologies (DNS for the domain, then email for the username) that are open, well understood and easy to implement seems appropriate.<p>What's the alternative? Using some kind of pseudo-GUID and then maybe a derivative of the Paxos distributed consensus algorithm to decide if it is to be trusted? I'd imagine there would be a good number of PhDs in that approach before a system like that would be close to being ready for actual implementation.<p>This system seems just about as decentralized as is practical.

Google controls their Internet experience, not to mention their Emacs, Docs, and Calendar.  As to why they comment on Larry Page's report to the investors... it's probably because they can.  Larry Page is a celebrity, and people like celebrities.  When you can send a message to him for all to see, you feel some innate desire to do so.  (I don't do this, because I know that Larry Page should not give a fuck about what I think.

Now, when you authenticate against any BrowserID auth site, you simply sign with your private key and provide the e-mail address. Since the browser stores both, that's a trivial interaction.<p>The site then verifies your signature with the mail host.

First symptoms of infection are usually a high fever and very sick -- like a really bad flu (after this initial spike, you can go asymptomatic for years).<p>So you go to the doctor with flu-like symptoms, and they give you an HIV test.  Now if you haven't had unprotected sex or blood transfusion with an at risk partner the odds of you having contracted HIV is extremely low.  So the general recommendation is not to test you for HIV. But you say, ""I want to rule it out.  Give me the HIV test.""  Modern medical testing is rarely 100%.  The HIV test is 99% accurate, but 1% of the time you won't have HIV, but it will say you do.<p>So imagine a population of 1000 zero risk people who take the test.  On average 10 are going to come back as HIV positive.  And maybe start an HIV regimine, rather than just realizing that its just the flu, which would have gone away in another day.<p>The point is you try to focus on what is common first.

I spent a fair amount of time with Drupal and it was technically very impressive even though ultimately it was not for me because the tradeoffs were not where I wanted to be as a developer.<p>The thing is, what a CMS does is cater to a site which does not have the budget for custom software.  A system like Drupal gives a tremendous amount of bang for the buck, and of the open source CMSes, it's hook system is definitely the most powerful once you really understand how to drive it.  In the end you're hitting the Drupal sweet spot when you write just a bit of glue code here and there to tune the functionality of existing modules to what you need.<p>In short Drupal and other CMSes let you build sites with a scope of functionality which would be impossible to do custom development for.  In this type of market cost is such a factor that anything less ubiquitous than PHP would be a strike against the system.  Furthermore, as the number of modules grow, you need a very large community to keep everything working smoothly, so you don't want to go with a language that has lesser adoption.<p>Personally I can't stand CMSes because I feel like the abstraction is at the wrong level.  To me it's mediocrity by 1000 tiny assumption mismatches.  Using Rails or Django I feel like I can craft a minimal, excellent and highly tuned UX <i>exactly</i> to my vision with a better language and lower overhead.  Making a CMS in Ruby or Python doesn't address the root pain of living within a heavy and immobile scaffolding.  There's a reason you don't hear much about the many open-source Rails CMSes that have been floated over the years.",1310685850

However, if you use a COW based virtual disk layout like QCOW2 which I guess is standard in KVM, you may see additional scattered IO.<p>I think it is weird to be using COW virtual disk layouts on a file system that natively supports COW as is the case with BTRFS. I would be curious to see what the performance of raw sparse files on BTRFS is vs. qcow2 etc.",1310685224

I likened it to know what the compiler is doing when you build say a recursive tree walk. If you don't know how compilers work, and you decide to pass your tree node structures on the stack, you suddenly 'blow up' the stack when your tree gets above a certain (unpredicted!) size.

For instance, if our brains are adapting to the fact that we can look up information, could we possibly be improving the breadth of knowledge we are aware of.<p>As an example, say we have X objects. Of X objects, there are Y properties. There are also N folders. We have two classes of subjects participating in the experiment. \nSubject class A is tasked with memorizing the Y properties of X objects. \nSubject class B is tasked with memorizing which folder of N the Y properties of X object is located.<p>If for example, X = 100 and Y = 5 then N = 100.\nAn example result for A subjects might be an average of 5 objects where each of the 5 properties were memorized correctly. [That's 5 properties x 5 objects = 25 memory units]. The question I have, is if B subjects would remember an average of 25 objects stored in which folders correctly, or might they remember less/more correctly? If the Y properties vary in type (from color, to weight, to appearance, etc) do they require more memory power than a consistent X is in N folder memorization?<p>If it turns out you can memorize more about where information can be found, than you can about the actual information then it would seem that [for so long as the information can be looked up] it is more practical to catalog that information exists and where it can be found, than to engage in memorizing the information itself.<p>Then the idea of ""being a jack of trades, master of none"" has a slightly different caveat.

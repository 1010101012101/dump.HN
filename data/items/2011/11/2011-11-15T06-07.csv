seeing and hearing about the next big
product to hit ClickBank...<p>It's all about a system to automate your
traffic and Ive been given exclusive details 
about it, and wanted you to have the lowdown.<p>So here it goes...what it is, what it does, 
and anything else you might want to know<p> and pay attention, because this product could 
create for you ""your moment"" where you either 
finally start making money for the first time, or 
your sales finally explode to the level you've
been hoping for.<p><i></i><i>What IS Automated Traffic?<p>Its an arsenal of scripts and software tools that 
allow you to automate your traffic and, ultimately,
your sales. Every month you continue to get more
scripts and they're all web based, so you don't 
have to worry about losing software and data if 
your computer crashes.  Plus all upgrades to the 
scripts can be done automatically without messy 
codes and other hassles.<p></i><i></i>What can these scripts and software tools do?<p>Let me give you some examples of the scripts
coming out the very first month or two:<p>1.  Blogger SEO Tool -- a cool script that
automatically takes any Blogger blog (don't 
worry, they'll teach you how to set one up in 
seconds!), and once it runs through the blogger 
SEO tool, it automatically ""hacks"" the blog to 
make it very SEO friendly to rank for  almost 
any easy to semi-competitive keyword almost 
instantly.<p>2.  List Building and Sales Grabbing Contact 
Form Tool -- (Sales and Lead Generator)  -- this 
tool is basically a super cool contact form where 
you can create any kind of contact form with it, 
but it also does a few cool things...<p>It can have the lead email you information directly, 
it can also have it so it automatically has them 
sign up in the background to your autoresponder 
(like Aweber, GetResponse, etc. already built in) 
as well as stuffs any cookies / affiliate links you 
want when they hit submit.  You'll be taught 
how to turn this into some easy money for 
reviews, bonuses, services, or your own products.<p>3.  Exclusive Buyer Keyword Tools -- this is 
actually several different keyword tools that 
are designed to find very lucrative keywords 
that are not only easy to rank for with our 
other tools, but are more likely to lead to sales 
by targeting people already at the end of the 
buying cycle.<p>You'll target keywords that not only are more 
likely to bring in larger sales, but are also 
being ignored by the competition.  It's also 
worth noting that this is based on an exclusive 
formula and these keywords can't be grabbed 
by any other keyword tool out there. (Others 
rely on the same sources, which aren't the best.)<p>4.  Survey Lead Generator -- this tool basically 
allows you to create surveys of multiple choice, 
true and false, survey reply, etc. and based on 
the answers they give, you can show any 
text, html, videos, links, etc. you want (and 
stuff the cookies at the same time as well).<p>It's great for convincing customers that your 
answer (like which product / service to buy) is 
tailored specifically to them, as well as sending 
the survey to your list for higher conversions 
on whatever you promote.<p>5. Automated Ads Elite - banner rotator  - this tool 
is like the open-x script that big time CPA people 
and sites use and it's pre-loaded with hot Clickbank
products. This does so many things that I don't even
have time to list it all.<p>Plus...you get ongoing cutting edge training, so 
you always know how to get the most out of 
each tool.<p><i></i>*How much does it cost?<p>Good question. This is the actual personal
software that the owner of the scripts uses. His
identity is being kept a secret, but I guess
he's made millions behind the scenes using
this stuff.<p>Plus, I've heard he's the current record holder at
ClickBank for members sticking around the longest
for one of his other sites... I anticipate this product 
being no different.<p>So even though I don't know the actual
cost yet, it would appear to be in the ""very
affordable"" range for members to be able to
stick around for a long time.<p>It goes live at 11 AM Eastern, on Tuesday May 11th.
Write that down. This could change the scope
of your business forever.<p>Check It Out Here:<p>http://dutchy33.auttraffic.hop.clickbank.net",1321340325

The encoded message in most of the replies fall in to a few categories: 1) to understand the technical feasibility of their vision and 2) as a way of showing initiative.<p>#2 is what code jockeys want to see and the natural way for a coder to measure initiative is in lines of code. What non-technical founders don't seem to realize is that you can begin building the product without writing code: 
- Make a landing page. 
- Do A/B testing on marketing and company names. 
- Talk with customers. (this is huge)
- Weigh the pros and cons of different business models.
- Tied in very closely with the above but plan features.
- Do everything BUT the code.<p>In other words, execute.",1321340276

3237323,comment,3234196,3236542,0,0,danbmil99,,,"How many startups come from NZ?  The point here isn't ""employment law"", it's the fact that in the USA (generally, in the private sector) employment is considered a contract, not an entitlement.<p>If people at Square don't like the environment, they are free to find another job.  Similarly, if Dorsey doesn't like an employee's output for any reason, or ""the cut of his jib"" for that matter, he pays him up to the day and fires him.  If it can't be shown to be due to discrimination (race, gender etc), and there was no employment contract, that's that.<p>Without this culture, starting a company would be nearly impossible.  You can see evidence of this in the number of innovative startups out of more heavily regulated countries vs. the US.<p>[edit: I would add that there is a perverse incentive here: I believe US startups under-hire women and people of color _precisely_ because it is not that difficult to make a case for discrimination in promotion, compensation, and treatment of employees here.  Hiring white, upper-middle-class males greatly reduces that risk.  I think it's an unfortunate unintended consequence of the desire to redress discrimination.]",1321339895

The code is as far as I can tell a simplest way to handle an index out of bounds, but to also handle a 'slice out of bounds' it would need to also compare to the string value ""runtime error: slice bounds out of range"" -- not helping the case for error handling in Google Go.<p>This code strikingly shows deficiencies in Google Go non-local error handling:<p>- Tons of boilerplate (defer, recover, re-panic, type check, value check)<p>- Not scoped so can only handle an error once per function<p>- Have to do value tests in addition since types are very generic due to implicit interfaces<p>- Error values are poorly defined<p>- Result for higher-level caller is buried deep in the function and non-obvious<p>These problems extend to all non-local error handling in Google Go, not just for this specific case of array and string indexes.

3237307,comment,3236820,3236979,5,0,Joeri,,,"You don't need to involve the server in generating the UI at all. You can have a static index.html, that bootstraps a javascript environment from static js files, whose first order of business is to contact a web service to fetch the initial content and configuration as JSON data. This makes all content static except that which is truly dynamic, which offers amazing CDN and caching possibilities. The JSON data can be cached in local storage, for easy offline support without constantly revving manifest files.<p>Once you get at that point, the dev experience starts to look a lot like traditional desktop client-server app development. Except desktop apps are built using components instead of templates, components that combine rendering and behavior into one encapsulated entity that you can treat like a black box. There's nothing preventing a web app from using that same architecture. In fact, ExtJS does just this.<p>But I don't think it stops there. I think we're going to get meta-configuration languages like mxml to send the layout of these components to the javascript environment, which will, essentially, mean that we're building another browser inside the browser.

From p. 35:<p><pre><code>  Both sides of (7) end up equal to the same matrix U,

What is the importance of ""and the steps to get there are all reversible""?

But the entertainment industry is a large part of the US economy and has some legitimate concerns about how to protect its cash flow in an age where the marginal cost of copyright infringement is asymptotically approaching zero. <i>Naturally</i> the industry is going to argue for an extremely narrow interpretation of property rights under such circumstances, and copyright radicals don't help themselves with rallying cries such as 'information wants to be free' which sounds suspiciously like welfare socialism for couch potatoes. So far the best argument from the reform side is 'make better content and people will willingly throw money at you' which is on a par with demanding that government or captains of industry create more jobs or cut spending or pay more taxes.<p>It takes little account of the producers' economic dilemma, which is unreasonable, and in policy arguments the least reasonable-sounding participant <i>usually loses</i>. Notice how the best public wins against the RIAA and its ilk have come as a result of unreasonable overreach, eg the contention that LimeWire users owe RIAA members $75 trillion in damages. SOPA can be sold to a largely indifferent and ignorant public as a reasonable response to the objective fact of industrialized copyright infringement. As you might have noticed, the public is not too hot on free trade and related concepts at the moment, because unemployment is so high and wage growth is so low. So the Techdirt crowd end up sounding like the digital equivalent of Occupy Content - even where people may agree with it, there's a certain air of entitlement to the whole thing, the public has a limited appetite for the Chicken Little story, and the ongoing failure of the sky to fall (ie of innovation to halt despite the lamentable flaws of the copyright and patent systems) eventually causes them to stop listening.<p>This is rapidly turning into a philosophical argument, and we're probably not going to agree about methods. My question to you (and indirectly, to Techdirt) is this: what/where is the alternative to the IP <i>status quo</i> that will increase cash flow and jobs? A nice simple easy-to-understand alternative is a necessity, because although I personally believe in creative destruction and the marketplace of ideas, 'leave it to the market' is <i>not</i> a winning argument with the general public right now. What's needed is a positive alternative that offers an obviously bigger payoff than SOPA.",1321338404

I certainly am not aware of any way of proving it either way in this life, and indeed the evidence I am aware of (in either direction) is highly ambigious.  And of course, even if you decide you personally beleive there is a God (or a multitude of them) that does not indicate which (if any!) of the currently available religions is closest to correct.<p>I arrived at my decision to believe in Christianity by a leap of faith.  I think there is some evidence I can bring to bear to support it, but I am the first to admit that it would not stand up in most courts of law much less in the arena of science.  I believe it because on an intuitive emotional level, it seems right.<p>Thus, I try to respect all religious beliefs.  I cannot prove my beliefs are correct.  I cannot disprove someone else's beliefs (excluding a very few fringe groups that make provably false claims, and even then it is those specific claims not the religion as a whole I could disprove).<p>But, while my <i>belief</i> in God is a personal thing, the existence or nonexistence of God is a fact.

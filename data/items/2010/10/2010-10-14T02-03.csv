1789661,comment,1789435,1789644,0,0,michaelchisari,,,"First off, your feed won't provide a full copy of your data, just a summary and a link.  Other protocols may not work that way, though, but that's how Appleseed's protocol works.  If access is rescinded, that user loses access to view that data.  If I post a journal update or a photo, and it shows up in your feed, and then I restrict access to it, if your feed doesn't properly delete the entry, then you can still see the summary or the thumbnail, but clicking on it results in an access denied error.<p>Well, let's focus on your premise:  This is all based on a node turning evil.  That's a very big problem, and one not easily solved.<p>There is a basic issue here, in that users, when they trust other users, they also, on some level, trust the that user's community (node).  I'm open to suggestions on how to mitigate that.<p>With social networking, there is always a level of trust that has to be human-based, not tech-based.  But tools can be used to help humans determine trust.<p>Appleseed has node control, which means that administrators can ""block"" whole nodes if they're behaving badly.  This usually means spam, but it can also mean if a node is acting in bad faith (ie, it's revealed that AppleBook is selling non-local user data), or if they're abusing the protocol.  That can act as a certain type of social ""shunning"" on a node-to-node basis.<p>Admins can also ""trust"" nodes, which means you inherit their block list.  This means, theoretically, if a node goes bad, and some nodes realize this, it'll propagate through the Appleseed network until that node is isolated.<p>I think there are other approaches, and some we haven't thought up yet, but one thing I'm most interested in is social pressure, and how it can easily be applied to bad nodes.<p>I think encryption is interesting, but I think we'll actually have to move into the browser space in order to have a reasonable UX.",1287024990

1789651,comment,1789358,1789580,0,0,starpilot,,,"Proprietary trading does not necessarily involve insider information.  ""Insider"" refers to those privy to exclusive data about a public corporation that have not been publicly released.  Insider trading laws do not preclude trading on independently drawn ideas, and do not entail publicizing one's own reasons for deciding to invest, because those ideas do not originate within the company being considered for investment.  An investment bank may trade away with whatever methods they have in-house, as long as they have not gained via information about the company that is not publicly available.  “Private commercial sources” is vague, but if you mean paid databases like LexisNexis, Hoovers, or even 10kwizard, those just consolidate already public information in a more convenient formats.  They don’t draw from insiders.<p>Of course, it's an open secret that insider trading is rampant in all major stock markets.  You can’t police every pair of CEO golf buddies.  I can’t provide a cite, but a study done a few years ago confirmed major movements shortly before (hours) major announcements with the vast majority of stocks in the Canadian exchanges.  I’d expect the problem to be greater in the US markets.",1287024808

Here's an example.  Let's say that I'm on MySeed and you're on Applebook.  We friend each other and, lovely, now my posts get aggregated to your feed and your posts get aggregated to my feed.  Life is good.  Then Applebook turns evil and decides that it's going to make all posts open (they have the source code and the data).  Well, now I no longer have privacy.  Heck, let's say I post something and it gets aggregated to your feed.  Then I delete it.  Does Applebook then delete it?  There's no real way to force a deletion.  And I realize that anyone who saw it could have just done a copy/paste and saved the post, but it's different when it's happening automatically.<p>The only way I could see this working is through public key encryption.  When we friend each other, I get your public key and you get mine.  You can then make your postings available encrypted with my public key and when I get them I can decrypt them with my private key.  BUT I must not store my private key with MySeed since then MySeed could decrypt your posts and you no longer have privacy.  Right now, browsers don't have support for encryption like this where part of a web page will be encrypted not by the server, but in the data storage.<p>But even that has problems.  It means that if you're friends with 500 people, 500 copies of any status message you post have to be encrypted and stored separately for each of those 500 people.  Considering the scaling issues that Facebook has to contend with, I think adding a step where everything people post gets encrypted and stored N times (N being the number of friends you have) would be troublesome.<p>Heck, what about pictures?  It's one thing to encrypt and store a short 140byte status 500 times.  It's another to do that for an 80k photo.<p>tl;dr: If we're friends and you're on another service, what stops your service from aggregating my postings and then making them public to the world against my wishes?",1287024390

However, it needs to be read very carefully.<p>The founders referenced in the study are not the typical venture/angel funded technology startups. According to Krisztina Holly, one of the reports authors, “only 11% and 9% for VC and angel financing.” It’s those 20% that I would classify as “Scalable Startups” and where I am really interested in understanding the founders ages.<p>The rest of the enterprenuers fall into a category I would call “small business.” Nothing wrong with that, but it makes the age comparison an Apples and Oranges discussion.<p>In summary, the Kauffman report, which lots of people now use to point to the fact that entreprenuers average age is 39, may say that. But it may not. There is not enough information in the current report to understand the founders age in technology startups who get risk capital.<p>steve",1287022380

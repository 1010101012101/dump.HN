I will grant that it&#x27;s more verbose than Haskell.<p>But I am not doing maps and filters all the time in my code.<p>> It&#x27;s not possible to write a generic container without casts to interface{}, which is a shame imo.<p>My point is that generic containers are <i>the</i> feature where generics are genuinely needed. And in those cases interface{} makes it possible. Not super-awesome, but possible. I actually like that the language doesn&#x27;t bend over to fulfill something that looks almost like an edge case.

You can easily backup it. Access from different machine won&#x27;t give you data that you stored on other machine, unless syncing between them is implemented.<p>- Keeping your data remotely?<p>Biggest advantage is that you can conveniently access data from any machine (connected to internet). Biggest drawback is lack of full control over data. If server (or cloud, if you insist) is down, there is nothing you can do, unless local full off-line caching is implemented.<p>I prefer keeping stuff locally. If you use desktop and mobile apps for instance, then syncing apps on LAN, without need for additional server, is nice and very efficient, even if a bit less convenient.<p>---<p>Context (only for curious):<p>I want to create standalone desktop (maybe Android later too) SoundCloud client that will solve most of my problems regarding bad UX in their current web UI. SC API doesn&#x27;t provide all the functions you have on site (at least officially), so such client may not provide exactly the same functionality, but I still believe I&#x27;ll be able to deliver (if time will allow that) something that will bring actual UX improvement, especially to devoted-listener-and-commentator workflow. Discovery and uploading features will be post-poned for later.<p>What would be stored by this client? All user&#x27;s data from SC, i.e. tracks, playlists, comments, so it would be kind of SC user account backup, but there would be also additional stuff too, like number of your plays of others&#x27; tracks. By keeping all your SC user&#x27;s data outside of SC, you&#x27;ll never lose any trace of your comment that track owner deleted or deleted the track it was left on.<p>Hopefully in upcoming weeks I&#x27;ll post on HN link to email + SC login signup page for those interested in being informed about availability of first alphas.",1404474339

If communication is too granular there&#x27;s too much synchronization overhead, which can be fixed by buffering, which in turn increases latency. Game engines have been swinging back and forth over the past 10 years on this a lot. First the trend was to have a few &quot;fat threads&quot; (maybe input+gamelogic->physics->visibility->rendering) which ran in parallel but which were coupled like a pipeline working on the previous frame&#x27;s data. Each pipeline stage meant one frame more latency. Add the rendering API/driver latency, plus whatever the display device adds, and suddenly games had something like 100ms latency or even more which is very noticeable. Then people started to make the game loop a simple sequence of subsystem stages again, but subsystems split their work on the current frame internally into small parallel tasks. It will be interesting what the perfect game engine architecture will look like for VR with its ultra-low latency requirements from sensory input to display update.",1404472520

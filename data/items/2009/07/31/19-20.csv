The PHP devs focus has clearly been stability and integrating the most widely used extensions into the core.<p>As you yourself said, ""so goes the life of a language whose design is driven by demand and not theory.""",1249070307

There's an old saying about how you can make <i>any</i> program run quickly if there's no requirement for it to be correct. I don't care how small your processor is or how special your embeddedness makes you; ample evidence says that letting input data segfault your or worse, get executed as code, is a real and pressing problem, vs. the almost-always hypothetical problems of a little bit of overhead when dealing with buffers (to do it <i>properly</i>, no less). <i>Start</i> with correct code.<p>By the way, as I use this word ""correct"" I'm feeling a bit like an academic wonk, but bear in mind that I'm not talking ""provable"" or anything.

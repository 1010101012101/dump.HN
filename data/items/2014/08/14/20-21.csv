8179830,comment,8176921,8176921,1,0,tedchs,,,"> sometimes amounting to over 100 gigabytes each second.<p>So that&#x27;s 800 gigabits per second, nearly a Tbps.  Which is a <i>lot</i> of network throughput.  Although this is not impossible, it seems surprisingly high, and I wonder if the article should have said &quot;100 gigabits each second&quot;, which is still a lot of bandwidth but a little more reasonable.<p>The article describes the data being transmitted as largely telemetry.  Let&#x27;s say they are sampling each of their metrics every 10 milliseconds (100/second), and they need a 32 bit integer to store each value.  So, that&#x27;s 100 * 32 / 8 = 400 bytes per second per metric.  Divided into 100 gigabytes, that would be 250 <i>million</i> metrics.  Even if you change these assumptions, clearly this link is used for more than telemetry.<p>800 Gbps requires a large number of computers to generate and transmit, then another large set of machines at HQ to ingest all that data and then run analytical models against it.  Just to handle the network traffic, without any data analysis, if you assume servers have a pair of 10 Gbps network interfaces, that&#x27;s 40 machines.<p>If you assume hard drives can write at about 100 megabytes per second, that&#x27;s 1,000 disks just to handle the write IOPS.  But, with those 40 machines, that&#x27;s an average of 25 disks per machine, so not unreasonable.  With SSD&#x27;s it would be fewer devices.<p>I do not know if a way to get this much network throughput over a radio link, so I can&#x27;t imagine it&#x27;s all coming from the car itself.<p>It would be interested to know what other data is transmitted over this link during a race other than telemetry.",1408049976

8179813,comment,8178475,8178475,4,0,araes,,,"I used to live in Idaho, and its interesting to me to be able to track back trends that we anecdotally could see happening, but had no hard numbers on.  For example, one of the major trends has been the population volatility, and particularly California immigration due to the lack of population and low land cost.<p>In 1950, 1% of Idahoans were from California.  In 1960, 2%.  In 1970, 4%.  In 1980, 7%.  In 1990, 7%.  In 2000, 9%.  In 2012, 12%.<p>To me, this is particularly cool when compared to a state like Alabama or Tennessee.  Literally no change in relative immigration from neighbors except for a slow loss of native children.<p>In fact, you could create a volatility scale for states (how homogeneous is their immigration over time) and it would go from almost zero in the East to crazy in the West.  Oregon, Arizona, and Nevada being particularly interesting / volatile states.<p>I wonder if there&#x27;s a correlation to the volatility and the general political leanings of those locations.  IE, does politics diffuse along these same lines?  If California, was 75% &quot;liberal&quot; and 25% &quot;conservative&quot; over time, could we estimate that Idaho has gotten about 7% more liberal in the last 40 years? or is the immigration self selecting?

8179805,comment,8178940,8179442,8,0,ryanpardieck,,,"If native advertising is nothing more than brands attaching their names to articles, why don&#x27;t these publications simply implement a way to buy ads on specific articles, or on articles with certain very specific subjects? As in something like, &quot;Whenever you run an article whose main subject is adult ADHD, we will pay a premium to occupy all of the available ad placements on that article.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve never understood about native advertising. If it&#x27;s as pure as its proponents say, why is it even needed? Why does a print magazine need a &quot;native&quot; article when they could sell a massive, full-page ad on the page right across from that article? Doesn&#x27;t it accomplish the same thing? And if advertisers <i>aren&#x27;t</i> somehow exerting an editorial influence, then what exactly has been gained here?<p>It seems to me that there are two options: 1) &quot;native advertising&quot; is merely a hypeword that makes it easier to charge a premium for ad space, because it gets buyers irrationally excited. 2) The thing of value being sold w/ native advertising is actually a very tiny amount of editorial influence, something which otherwise is incredibly scarce and, ethics aside, would understandably carry a very high pricetag.<p>edit - of course there is the other option, which most likely is the real-life case: 3) Native advertising is valuable because it is not a traditional ad-space, consumers aren&#x27;t used to it, and most readers will not recognize it as an ad unless they read carefully (and how many publications are read carefully, really?).",1408049653

If Dell purchases a traditional banner ad on Mashable I can reasonably assume that they had no input on the article, even minimal input about the article subject.<p>But native advertising, for the lack of a better work, is sneaky. For all I know Dell may have simply suggested the article subject. Or they may have submitted spelling or grammar revisions. Or written the entire article at Dell corporate headquarters.<p>The only bulwark I have, as a reader, is your word. A promise that your editorial process will not be compromised by advertiser interests. The editorial process is a black box that I can&#x27;t open or inspect. And that should concern me.<p>I recently watched a PBS Frontline documentary on the creation of the mass-surveillance programs under Bush and continued under Obama. One scene stood out in my mind. The editor of the New York Times had a story, maybe as early as 2003, that contained Snowden-esque revelations about the burgeoning mass-surveillance programs. After a meeting with top-level officials, including members of the President&#x27;s cabinet, he decided to axe the story. The NYT editor had an opportunity to bring the public into the discussion about mass-surveillance. But he made a mistake - he held back. His poor judgement allowed the program to continue to grow unchecked for nearly a decade.<p>The point is, if the editorial process of the nation&#x27;s &quot;paper of record&quot; is so amendable to the interests of the state, why should anyone believe a tech publication like Mashable is any less amendable to corporate interests?<p>The only way to restore trust is to verify. Add good start is to embrace technology like the AdDetector plugin. Publish a list of URIs of all articles that contain native advertising, so tools like AdDetector can easily identify and label such articles. Let us know how many words are written by staff, how many are written by the advertiser, and who decides the subject matter. Give us transparency.<p>On one level I really don&#x27;t care if Mashable or any other publication re-prints corporate-written articles whole cloth.

Stupid bite-size pieces of low-effort content more reliably convert into advertising dollars, and everyone knows it. Readers have attention spans that require that you grab them within the first half second of a page load, or they&#x27;re gone. A 12-page expose that took a journalist 8 months of intense investigative work to produce isn&#x27;t likely to return even that journalist&#x27;s salary on &quot;dumb&quot; advertising, let alone make any money. As a result, outlets have had to stretch and bend to try to find ways to pay the bills.<p>I actually think that&#x27;s why native advertising is a ray of hope for the industry - by allowing advertisers to fund (but critically, not direct) the creation of content up-front, it actually opens up the financial means to produce content that might otherwise be unprofitable. In a perfect world, it would be unnecessary, but media is a low-margin industry already, and the bills have to get paid somehow. If you have better ideas on how to do it, there&#x27;s a lot of money waiting to be made. :)",1408048523

How well that is actually maintained is up to the sales and editorial teams striking the deal, of course.<p>A good team won&#x27;t take a deal that will tie their hands; if BP says &quot;We want a solar energy series, but you can&#x27;t say anything bad about us&quot;, then that deal isn&#x27;t likely to be struck. We might pitch them on an alternate series that doesn&#x27;t risk putting them in the crosshairs, but letting the brand have any say in the content is a big no-no, and the sales team works to try to find advertising opportunities that work well with advertisers, rather than working against them.<p>Just personally, I think it&#x27;s healthy to assume that any sponsored content is influenced by the sponsor, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s valid to write off any content that happens to have a sponsorship attached to it as invalid, inaccurate, or biased.

It might be a bit disingenuous to use such a script, but that slight is less important if the conversation doesnt feel disingenuous. The only difference to the other participant is whether or not he knows of the disingenuousness. That is a cost which, however, can also be offset by potential gains. In this case, the gain is sympathy. People, in most conversations today, remain remarkably distant and non caring.<p>For example, contrast how the following two sentences make you feel: &quot;That sounds hard&quot; and &quot;I don&#x27;t know much about that line of work, what sort of challenges do you face?&quot; The first sympathizes with you whereas the second is more interrogatory which distances the speaker. The first is something a friend might say and the second is something an interviewer might say. Lastly, the line isnt meant to be a literal script pages long, but rather as an icebreaker to make this person feel like they can talk to you without being interrogated. Where the conversation goes after that is completely unknown. This is also the logic behind trying to put off asking &quot;what do you do&quot;, because you again become an interviewer.",1408047289

8179523,comment,8176616,8176616,21,0,byuu,,,"> I did some research and this seems to be an original idea. Why hasn’t anyone tired this before?<p>I&#x27;ve done it. Making the emulator, debugger, and hooks to extend games is the easy part. The really hard part is getting people to then go back and enhance games.<p>In my case, I created some new I/O registers for the SNES. One set is called MSU1, which lets you read in up to 4GB from a data file, and also lets you mix in CD-quality audio (which you can use for voice acting, or replacing audio tracks while keeping sound effects.) Particularly nice about the MSU1, was that it was designed to be possible on real hardware. And a flash cart called sd2snes implements it.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past with a remastered audio soundtrack: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnAg2T7d6uU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnAg2T7d6uU</a><p>And here&#x27;s an example where the Playstation full-motion video intro was inserted into the SNES version: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_jXf7FHGA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_jXf7FHGA</a>  (yes, that full motion video really is possible on a real SNES.)<p>Not an enhancement, but d4s ported Road Blaster (a full FMV game) to the SNES, even: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THJvsIezXrQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THJvsIezXrQ</a><p>Another I/O register set I put in place was called HSU1. This one lets your SNES game send and receive network packets. I&#x27;ve used it to implement a high-score leaderboard in Campus Challenge &#x27;92 and Powerfest &#x27;94. You play the game in the emulator, and your score shows up on a website. But it&#x27;s bi-directional. You could take this concept a lot further, with dynamic content in games, special events on certain days, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve also toyed with adding rumble support to the controllers. Although I was beaten to the punch there by some patches a guy made for the Xbox port of ZSNES a few years prior.<p>Lastly, in our community, we have some pretty sophisticated OpenGL pixel shaders. One person implemented a real-time map display of Super Metroid where the shader read in the player position from the SNES&#x27; RAM. You could utilize that concept to show any kind of additional information to the player.",1408046450

I know a lot about the MySQL database (and a little about PostgreSQL), enough to write failover software, automate deployments, write guardian crons which slap down problematic queries & pre-emptively, automate backups, do vip failover and haproxy configuration... and I still have to go to my boss for most of the hard questions.<p>His knowledge encapsulates 12 years of working with and around MySQL, and it&#x27;s proven invaluable to our customers. Knowing when to force certain optimizations, how to make subqueries run O(1) vs O(n), how to rebuild a complete database from binary logs, how to configure MySQL to work with SSD caches... these problems don&#x27;t come up often, but when they do, not having a DBA available to you means contracting out to one at exorbitant rates.<p>It&#x27;s the difference between a few minutes of downtime when the proverbial dung hits the fan, versus a few hours or days.",1386950385

There&#x27;s no single &quot;global optimum&quot; that lifeforms are evolving towards; there&#x27;s no final hilltop; there&#x27;s no intent. This notion of &quot;Evolutionary Teleology&quot; is how we get things like X-Men (which I enjoy for the record, it&#x27;s not like X-Men is taught in biology class). If there <i>were</i> some global optimum, we&#x27;d all have eyesight like Legolas and the color-pallete of a Mantis-Shrimp, instead of a blind spot in the center of our retina.<p>Evolution just happens, and it is what it is. E.g. Natural Selection didn&#x27;t &quot;optimize&quot; giraffes so they could reach leaves. Natural Selection is simply a way of explaining that some giraffes had long necks, some had short, and the shorter just happened to die out. Similarly, NBA players didn&#x27;t &quot;evolve&quot; to play basketball. Some people are tall, and some are short, and the short people just didn&#x27;t make the cut. &quot;Select&quot; != &quot;Optimize&quot;. Evolution is better thought of as a historical accident.

6901136,comment,6899654,6900492,1,0,KMag,,,"Oh, and the right way for Alice and Bob to prove to each other that the holders of their public keys both know the secret password is to use an Augmented PAKE [1] (Password Authenticated Key Exchange) protocol, replacing the password with Scrypt( Concatenate(Alice&#x27;s public key, Bob&#x27;s public key), Password ).  (The concatenation of the public keys is used for the Scrypt salt.)  That way, at the successful conclusion of the Augmented PAKE exchange, Alice and Bob haven&#x27;t proved to each other knowledge of the password, but rather have tied the proof to their two public keys, and each can be assured that the holder of the other public key knows the password.  If there&#x27;s later a flaw found in the Augmented PAKE algorithm you choose that leaks the &quot;password&quot; used for the Augmented PAKE protocol, at least you&#x27;ve only leaked a memory-hard password hash of the real Password.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password-authenticated_key_agreement\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password-authenticated_key_agre...</a><p>Don&#x27;t get creative and start rolling your own zero-knowledge proof of passwords here.  It&#x27;s really easy to get wrong.  Use a very-well peer-reviewed Augmented PAKE algorithm.<p>THE NAIVE WRONG WAY for Alice to prove to Bob that she knows the Password (but might look good at first glance) is for Alice to send to Bob HMAC(Password, Alice&#x27;s Public Key) because then if Bob doesn&#x27;t know Password, he can still start bruit-forcing guesses without further interaction with Alice.  On average, it will take the Stasi an afternoon to bruit-force Password after pretending once to be Bob, and after that they can impersonate Alice when talking to Bob.  It&#x27;s very unlikely Alice will ever mention to Bob the one failed authentication, and nearly impossible that she&#x27;ll mention it within the window of time they have before the Stasi bruit-force the password.<p>Use an Augmented PAKE instead of a balanced PAKE, because you should use an Augmented PAKE for users to authenticate themselves to you, and that way you can share one implementation for both purposes and expose yourself to half the potential bugs.  With a Balanced PAKE, if an attacker gets read-only access to your server&#x27;s password store, they could immediately authenticate themselves to your service and upload more public keys as the user.  An Augmented PAKE in this case would slow down an attacker by forcing the attacker to bruit-force the passwords, and would completely save the 1% of your users who use passwords with 80 or more bits of entropy.",1386950283

But yeah, back in the day, tranched rounds with company performance targets were not unusual. In fact, they&#x27;re still practiced today -- typically by big corporate investors, as opposed to angels or VCs.<p>My personal opinion is that performance targets specifically, if not tranched payments in general, are bad for all concerned. Ostensibly they cover some downside for the investor, but startup investing is abot maximizing upside, not covering downside per se. At their worst, tranches and targets hold the company hostage to goals that are often arbitrary, and are almost always gamed accordingly. As a result, you have a company that is checking boxes and focusing on its arbitrary numbers, and you&#x27;ve got investors who don&#x27;t realize they&#x27;re creating perverse incentives. Also, it&#x27;s basically impossible to run any variant of the Lean Startup methodology when under the gun of performance-based tranches.<p>I say this having worked for a startup that accepted big corporate money on a tranch-based system with performance goals.

So after my trip I put my wife up for a night at a Weston, she agreed about the bed, and that&#x27;s what we ended up with.

If I lived there, well, making/selling mattresses must be a profitable business  from the retail pricing I could see. Mind you I was on Silicon Valley which I imagine must be very pricy.<p>The website is really beautiful. Well done. It almost makes you feel I have to buy this!!! I think that&#x27;s the key point.<p>Because apart from that... well... there&#x27;s a rule in business that is you get what you pay for. Even if mattress retailers are making a fortune on margins, well you guys also have margins too. And a retail price of $299..to..$499-king tells me that your mattresses are very low end.<p>So the website is beautiful but very misleading. Like the infographic about the cost of making a mattress. It probably should title it &quot;Here is how a <i>cheap</i> mattress is marked up&quot;. Because there is mattresses and mattresses. Tons of variations, fabrics and qualities. And well.. you&#x27;re not even selling mattresses or at least we don&#x27;t call that a mattress here ( Spain ) but a mat instead. It is just too thin. Less than half the thickness of a regular mattress. Then of course, the fact that is made of foam only makes it worse as with that thickness it will unavoidable deform with usage. Who tells otherwise is lying or just very new to the business plainly because all foam mattresses deform to some degree.<p>Then there is the foam density, that I can&#x27;t see anywhere in the specs. And as you can guess when you import materials the bigger the density the more expensive the foam sheets are. But hey, people today demand cheap prices. But anyways, mattresses these days tend to have lesser foam densities as people want cheaper prices. But of course that comes with the cost of deformability and that&#x27;s why mattresses these days don&#x27;t last that much as they used to in the past.<p>One thing that tells how good your marketing efforts are is that the mattress is foldable. Someone not used to mattress would think: AWESOME. Some used would think, oh no another crappy sofa-bed mat. I&#x27;d never recommend anyone to buy a foldable bed unless for an apartment with very low space and of course... for a sofa-bed!<p>So my summary would be: really well done making attractive a low-end product. The marketing is excellent and you definitely found a market out there. The website is beautiful but well.... you sell what you sell, tons of half-truths on it.",1386949102

My productivity _appeared_ to go down, while he was always ready to take on a new project (before handing it off to me in a mess).

I discovered that the _user_ font folder had simply been replaced with a shortcut to the _system_ font folder, and we didn&#x27;t have the permission to restore it. So they had deleted every users custom fonts already, and now after I discovered and proved their error they had to restore it to the way it was. They looked like _heros_ for fixing the big problem on the worst day, but ultimately it was only their incompetence that created the problem in the first place. Their reasoning was that TTF fonts can sometimes carry viruses within them that infect Windows computers… (And we use OTF fonts on OS X)",1386948744

This comes with benefits and curses.<p>It is freakishly powerful.  If you want, you can roll back just your view of the database to three hours ago.  You can show different versions of the same schemas to different clients.  You can dynamically scale out your database to hundreds of servers without having to manually shard.  You can do multi-master replication, master-to-slave, master-to-slave-to-master, any combination you can think of.<p>Your database clients can automatically detect when a primary has gone down and fail over to a standby, which will automatically be brought online, no admin intervention necessary.<p>If you give Oracle raw disks, you can tell it to automatically use the faster parts of the spindles for more commonly used data.  Or give it some SSDs, and it&#x27;ll use it for cache.  Or, if you buy Oracle storage servers, it&#x27;ll actually offload basic query execution to the storage.<p>With that power comes great cost and complexity, which is why many web companies don&#x27;t bother with it - when you get to google or facebook scale you build these types of capabilities into your application tier.<p>But I know of a ton of multi-petabyte Oracle implementations at big traditional companies, and they love it.

6900971,comment,6899363,6899363,3,0,davesims,,,"Been thinking about this a lot lately, and I think one of the problems is the language and metaphors we use to describe the quality of the code.<p>Words like &#x27;clean&#x27;, &#x27;elegant&#x27;, &#x27;well-structured&#x27;, even SOLID are qualities of objects we want to consider at a distance, like statues or paintings. They are words of repose and reflection. You know: business death.<p>Here&#x27;s an example from this essay:<p>&quot;There is a reason good code is considered to be a form of poetry. It&#x27;s elegant, clean, easy to read, and fun to write. These are all exceptional qualities that we should strive for every single day.&quot;<p>Try telling a product manager or CEO or other stakeholder how &#x27;clean&#x27;, &#x27;easy to read&#x27;, or -- God forbid -- &quot;fun!&quot; your code is, and watch their eyes roll back in their head. (I exaggerate for effect.)<p>These ideas make sense to us as developers because that&#x27;s what we spend our entire day doing: considering, reflecting and thinking about code. But I think what we should be talking about is the inherent <i>speed</i> of the codebase. I&#x27;m not talking about my velocity as a developer, or the velocity of the team and how many story points they deliver per sprint, but the inherent velocity of the codebase as a function of its technical debt. Codebases, from a business standpoint, should not be &quot;clean&quot; or &quot;dirty&quot;, but rather &quot;fast&quot; or &quot;slow&quot;.<p>Technical debt should be surfaced to the stakeholders using language that conveys the dollar value, the fiscal liability, of technical debt. The most accurate way to describe that and show how debt is slowing your team down, is to talk about its inherent speed.<p>&quot;Our codebase is getting slower&quot; makes business sense to a Product Manager. &quot;Refactoring this will make our codebase faster&quot; is a phrase that conveys the worth of initiatives that otherwise seem to have no immediate effect on the bottom line.<p>All of the tools and agile methods we have talk about velocity in terms of what a team is delivering, and can parse that down to the sprint and developer level. But in my experience, the most significant contributor to a team&#x27;s relative speed is the (intertia|speed|velocity|momentum) of the codebase itself, as a function of its technical debt. I think we need to start using language that intuitively and constantly surfaces the dollar value of technical debt to the stakeholders, so that &quot;just ship it!&quot; no longer sounds like a sound business strategy.",1386948676

Such as Virgin Galactic. I think if innovation in these fields were brought into the responsibility of private investment, investors would see it as their job and not the state. In other words the state monopolises on grandiose scientific projects, making it too difficult for the average enterprise to compete.<p>This is probably due to the states mechanism of &#x27;bigging up&#x27; its own achievements in order to justify its own existence.<p>I think there&#x27;s a bright future for technology and science in the private sphere. Facebook working on AI is another recent example. Google have been funding scientific studies mostly in tech for years. We need to embrace this.<p>Big businesses understand that scientific breakthrough could well be the next biggest product on the market, even on a simple basis of materials. Producing newer, stronger, more durable materials is not just benefit to the producers, but to the consumers. State science rarely deals with practical innovation that we as consumers can benefit directly from either.<p>Almost every business, big and small has some form of R&D department or group, and more are following suite. It&#x27;s becoming a standard and I think in this model, we will see our species&#x27;s biggest gains in advancement.<p>I think another important point is that consumers have a choice when it comes to private enterprise, whereas they don&#x27;t when these funds are forcibly extorted through taxation. Those on minimum wage can barely afford essentials, let alone the money to fund space programs.<p>Long live private enterprise, long live Capitalism!",1386947242

The amount of intellectual hubris and arrogance we can develop is staggering.  Sheldon Cooper is not really a parody, it&#x27;s what many theoretical physicists actually think (but are to socially adapted to say out loud), as in: &quot;Penny - I&#x27;m a physicist. I have a working knowledge of the entire universe and everything it contains.&quot;   Deutsch may think he knows things about &quot;the mind&quot; but he shows in this article that, like many who like to speculate wildly about the mind, he&#x27;s basing his claim mostly on armchairing about how he <i>feels</i> about certain phenomena.   Things he says about behaviourism are indicative that he doesn&#x27;t <i>really</i> know what he&#x27;s talking about.  Or he does but is extremely bad at communicating his ideas.  It would just take too long to comment on each and every empty claim this article makes.  It&#x27;s mostly a rehash of same old boring arguments about how special we are, this time because of our &quot;creativity&quot;.  Yawn, there is nothing special about &quot;creativity&quot;, it&#x27;s an active area of research, has been for decades, and it&#x27;s actually very boring.  He does make a few good points, like the one that quantum phenomena do not give rise to mental processes, but that is trivial in the sense it&#x27;s obvious to anyone with some knowledge of quantum mechanics on one hand, and what neurons are and how they work on the other.",1386946851

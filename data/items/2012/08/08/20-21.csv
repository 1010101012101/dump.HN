4358033,comment,4357037,4357895,4,0,ak39,,,"While I would agree that meditation helps to introspect and obtain perspective, I don't think that <i>aiming</i> for happiness (of itself) is meaningful at all.<p>Yikes, I meant ... you cannot pursue happiness for happiness' sake.  It's a byproduct of living. Happiness is an oblique outcome of being - of existing.<p>I like what Robert Oppenheimer wrote to his brother Frank in one of his letters:<p>""Everyone wants rather to be pleasing to women and that desire is not altogether, though it is very largely, a manifestation of vanity. But one cannot aim to be pleasing to women any more than one can aim to have taste, or beauty of expression, or happiness; for these things are not specific aims which one may learn to attain; they are descriptions of the adequacy of one's living. To try to be happy is to try to build a machine with no other specification than that it shall run noiselessly.""\n~ Robert Oppenheimer",1344459543

I might implement a couple in a future post.<p>Numpy can handle a 10k by 10k matrix - in this case, you wouldn't want to print it to the spreadsheet, but you could still run the optimization.  I've tested to 100 tickers and there isn't a noticeable increase in computation time.  (I'm sure there would be at 10,000, but it's probably doable; the  constraint here might be fetching that much data.)<p>The optimization is done with a Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm [1], but SciPy has a lot of different functionality built in.  There's a different function, fmin_bgfs[2], that does use BFGS optimization.<p>Computations as a service is something we're definitely looking into; if there's enough demand we'll do it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder%E2%80%93Mead_method"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder%E2%80%93Mead_method</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.fmin_bfgs.html#scipy.optimize.fmin_bfgs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.op...</a>",1344459541

I know multiplayer between the two platforms has been ruled out, but transferring from one to another might be attractive. It also makes you wonder why they haven't done it. Games built for the XBLA are written in XNA and can be played with minimal adjustment on Windows.

4357994,comment,4356163,4356163,10,0,ocharles,,,"When I initially saw this posted here, I was irritated. The tone grates with me, and yes - I would prefer a much drier, concise explanation if I were to receive such a pull request for my projects. I kept this to myself though, and had a look at the comments here, and I've had time to mull on why I think this is potentially dangerous behaviour.<p>The tone and humour in that post requires a large amount of confidence in the changes being made, in order to write about the humorously, but also in the author themselves to actually present their work in such a tone. vmg is perfectly entitled to do both of these; the pull request is detailed, shows clear motivation and research, and vmg seems to know his stuff. The problem is that GitHub encourages networking. The damage comes when other people who are less experienced, or frankly, less knowledgeable, copy his style and do produce noise.<p>I worry about a risk of imitation of this culture, but missing the crucial underlying detail and explanation that's hidden in vmg's writing. I worry reasoning with this people will be difficult because they have trained themselves to have such arrogance in their work.<p>I prefer a dry report not only because it is succinct, not only because it makes my life easier to understand, but also because it encourages a disciplined state of mind. If you aren't able to write about something in a mature dry tone and back it up (that is, not cover up with humour), then you should doubt your work until you can amply support it. Yes, life is short, but it's also so short that I would like to get things done; rather than have to potentially argue past people to get important points across. Lets put this creativity into making great stuff, not making great pull request comments, eh?<p>Finally, all of this stuff builds a record for the project. A succinct, yet detailed, pull request is much more accessible a year down the line to understand the changes in more detail. Of course, this detail should be in the commit messages (and I <i>do</i> criticise vmg on poor commit messages here), but every bit of writing contributes towards project documentation, at some level. The more we can create a habit to create mature, if somewhat monotonous, technical writing, I do think the better.<p>So no, it's not just a ""I HATE HIS FUN"" argument; there are more reaching concerns, no matter how exaggerated you might think they are.",1344459011

Mostly it's just engineering.<p>Bootstrapping colonization is a slightly harder problem but there are some promising signs for that. First, research on reusable launch vehicles is coming along (at SpaceX for example), and if that works out it should lower launch costs by a factor of 10 to 100. Add to that the ability to use local resources on Mars and things start to get a lot easier. Within the earliest generation of manned missions to Mars we will likely have infrastructure for manufacturing rocket fuel (methane + oxygen) as well as producing building materials (concrete) and iron based materials (such as sintering iron rich regolith to manufacture rectenna arrays). That infrastructure will develop fairly rapidly and in a few years we'll start to see a real industrial and agricultural base develop on Mars. Of course the more mass we can throw at the problem early on the easier it will be to bootstrap.<p>One of the exciting things about Mars colonization is that it would likely serve as a proving ground for many technologies that could have applications on Earth. For example, solar power satellites are one of the best methods for providing power to a Mars base/colony. They're also one of the most promising technologies for Earth-based power generation, but the barrier to entry and the perceived financial risk has been too high.",1344456748

One can feel sad about that feedback or, after properly weighting it, parse it as the valuable guidance it is.<p>The markets provide cruel, ruthless feedback in the form of buy/pass behaviour. Getting that feedback as early as possible on one's MVP is insightful, albeit painful. Criticism can be more valuable than atomistically binary market activity by providing insight into <i>why</i> the market is behaving as it is (or will be).<p>Given the specific case, if the founders are working on a feature to fill the hole discussed, great - they have a bit of validation. If not, they have the opportunity to consider it. Either way, I don't see why there is a reason to get beaten up about it.<p>Negative feedback is as much a drag on innovation as market rejection. At worst, it should be a non-factor.",1344456446

It was, ""How do we make a more convenient service than the pirates?"" And that's where they won. In the early days, people pushed back. But then the brand of Valve as people won out over the brand of Valve as the makers of Half-Life. If you make a good product that has convenience over the alternative (piracy) and charge a reasonable amount, people will pay when they used to pirate. The DRM is incidental to the experience.

The fear that people will make fun of the first thing they launch.<p>Good.<p>The software world is absolutely flooded with half baked crap backed by expensive marketing. As a software user it's a waste of my time when somebody releases ""A Simply Remarkable Spreadsheet"" that allows you to ""organize and work with them in a whole new intuitive way"" and it lacks the basic features I expect from a spreadsheet (I suppose that is indeed remarkable). Worse, it leads to a situation where customers don't trust software developers to provide the things they say they are providing.<p>What would you have us do? Not criticize massively hyped app releases that are backed by millions of dollars of VC money because we might hurt somebodies feelings? If you are going to make a big fanfare about your new 'spreadsheet' app, then you have to be prepared for the (predictable) negative reaction when it turns out it isn't actually a spreadsheet at all. Don't get pissed off when it gets criticism after you flood all the tech news sites with press releases and submit your site to all the aggregators and email dozens of bloggers.<p>The people doing this are savvy and know what they are doing, which is basically conning users with false promises. They know it will earn them criticism from people who are paying attention, they don't care, they are in it for the money.  Your portrayal of the innocent, uncertain, timid startup CEO is pretty laughable. These are business graduates that decided to go into software startups because they think there is more money in it than investment banking at the moment, many have never written any software themselves.<p>You can whine all you want but customers are always going to complain when the product does not meet the description. It's really quite simple to avoid this though: stop lying in your marketing.<p>Edit: I didn't mean to make it sound like I think the Grid folks themselves are actually upset about this criticism, I'm sure they are not. They must have had many meetings trying to decide if they should call it a spreadsheet even though it isn't, and they obviously decided to do it because they feel they will get more attention as a 'mobile spreadsheet' rather than some vaguely defined data organiser. It was a calculated move that seems to be paying off at the initial launch at least, since the app is getting far more attention than most.",1344456111

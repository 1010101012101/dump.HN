Remember the 1999 movie EDtv ...'</i><p>Lets go way back to wearcomp  [0] with steve mann [1]  and cyberman [2] before we get all misty eyed.  I'd really like to see something more than just a camera. Mann has gone a step beyond mere transmission with augmentation. Better still go look what students & mann are looking at now. [3]  The tech details are here. [4]<p>Q. Does jtv have the ability for users to communicate? Or is it unicast?<p>

In a way, you could argue that this is great for them in that they get so much PR for angering users (for free) even though they were so careful checking with users before the change, and that bad PR gets them more users who are curious to see what all the fuss is about, etc.",1176374610

There is a huge cost involved in keeping track of all those tiny loans manually, and thus they need inexpensive and effective technology to manage their operations.<p>Mifos is an open-source microcredit banking system, and they need volunteers:

If the person defaults or runs away, the entire village's ""credit score"" is affected.<p>This is not theory: Millions of loans were granted worldwide, and in fact the default rate is actually lower than traditional banks in developed countries.<p>Note: My comments above are about microcredit in general, and not specifically about Kiva (which I don't know much about it)",1176374077

Dilemma.<p>You give me an internship and I'll work half the day on your startup, the other half on my project. For free, of course.<p>Of course, I can't do internships in 1 or 2 men companies, it has to be a bigger company than that, which leads me back to the original problem.",1176373481

The value of the PR they've received to date is unbelievable - I'm interested to see how they convert all this fame into a business model, which I'm sure they'll be able to do.  Nice job believing in their radical idea PG.",1176373336

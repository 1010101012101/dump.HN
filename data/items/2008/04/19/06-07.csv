Luckily I've had pretty good jobs for the last few years, and managed to put a bit away, and also lucky that my Wife is fully supportive of me doing this.... I think it would be impossible without that support.<p>I must say though, as cperciva said above, leaving a well paid job is very motivational too. And the fact that I'm 34, have a mortgage and am about to start a family ... there's no time to be unmotivated :)",1208587322

Ive been working by myself since the start of the year, and gave myself a deadline of 3 months to have something i could launch.<p>I finally setup my site on the production servers this week, and am in the process of testing it with some friends and making small changes. I think ill be ready to go more public with my site in a week or two ... so i'm a bit later than my initial goal ... but without that 3 month figure pushing me on, i think it would have been even harder.",1208586017
167903,comment,167753,167753,0,0,witten,,,"I run a subscription personal wiki service (<a href=""http://luminotes.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://luminotes.com</a>), and I open sourced the software that runs it from the start.. Mostly because I was sick of working on proprietary software for a living. And then two interesting things happened. First, people started signing up for paid subscriptions. And second, no one made a competing service from my source code (yet).<p>I think in general people overestimate the value of their source code. There are so many other things that you can bring to a business that any copy-cats wouldn't necessarily have (e.g. your knowledge of the source code, your vision for the product, etc). So don't flatter yourself into thinking that as soon as you release the source, a dozen competitors will spring up using your software. And even if they do, you'll still likely out-compete them.<p>So like making any business decision, weigh the advantages and disadvantages of open sourcing and make a decision based on those. But don't make the common mistake of overestimating the disadvantages.",1208585909
167902,comment,167848,167848,0,0,zkinion,,,"Alot of people here are referring to fear of messing up and failing as a means to gain motivation for a startup, whether its letting yourself down or letting others down.  I hope people don't get stress confused with actually working hard.  Yes, worrying about stuff can make you certainly work hard, but also getting into a good frame of mind every day and getting into a ""flow"" of completion of tasks works much better.<p>Running towards something good and being happy while your doing it works just as good, if not better than running away from something bad and being stressed at the same time.",1208585406

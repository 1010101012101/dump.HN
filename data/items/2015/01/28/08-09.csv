The iPad Air 2, for example, has a huge amount of power in it&#x27;s CPU and it&#x27;s not by far being used on OS level functionality like multitasking. Until Apple makes iOS more appealing and functional for tablets people will find it boring or &quot;just another version of an iPhone/iPod with big screen&quot;. Also there are some good and cheaper Android tablets in the market. For these reasons people don&#x27;t feel excited about iPad as they were before.<p>I owned an iPad 3 and now an Air 2 and i can say that the hardware is top notch and it still continues to be probably the best tablet of the market overall.

8958784,comment,8958731,8958731,0,0,skrebbel,,,"Nice! I think that if you use vanilla JS (even ES6), the class support adds more hassle than the gains it provides. For example, setting proptypes completely at the bottom of the file seems, well, cumbersome. It&#x27;s a bit like putting a function signature after the function body. From that perspective, using the old React.createClass syntax seems to keep everything together a bit nicer.<p>However, if you want to use e.g. TypeScript with React, than this is a very big thing! Up until now, it was always a bit of a hassle, and with this change, it&#x27;s completely straightforward (especially if you don&#x27;t want JSX). You&#x27;ll also need propTypes less because you can just use TypeScript interfaces for the `props` constructor parameter. Plus, TypeScript already has property initializers and all that, so all the other annoyances that you get when doing this with plain ES6 classes disappear with TypeScript.<p>I&#x27;m currently really considering porting my current project back to TypeScript for this single reason. The bad mix of TypeScript and JSX is what mostly holds me back. I&#x27;d like my view code to be somewhat understandable/hackable by designers and JSX really matters there.

Then I sometimes stare at objects in half-dark conditions and wonder if my eyesight is still not perfect or if this is the way &quot;normal&quot; eyes see such things (according to all tests my eyes are perfect, so what I see is normal .. just unexpected maybe?). In the end, the most profound change is that I don&#x27;t have to take care of my glasses anymore and they cannot fault in the worst situations.

Solaris 2 (the sysv one; the BSD SunOS 4 was after-the-fact renamed to Solaris 1) didn&#x27;t ship until 1993, not the 80s.  Also he says that gcc&#x27;s support for 68k was important but Solaris never ran on that platform -- Sun made the switch from 68k->SPARC a few years before the BSD->sysv change.<p>The wider point is correct, but it isn&#x27;t limited to just Sun.  The decision for many UNIX vendors to charge extra for the C compiler was a big reason that gcc caught needed momentum.  If that hadn&#x27;t happened the whole free *nix history might have been very different.",1422432436

Though amazingly experts will also learn many things and find it useful too.<p>I took the Physics 123 class at Harvard, from which this book developed from the original  course notes, and uses this as the textbook (the class is still taught by Horowitz who has encyclopediac knowledge of electronics and Hayes who replaced Hill when he left Harvard. These guys also wrote the accompanying lab manual which I also highly recommend). You had all sorts of non-scientific people in the class.<p>To give some context, one semester is split into two halves. The first half covers analog electronics, and ends with a lab where the whole class designed and built a system to take analog audio signal, pulse-width modulate it to an IR transmitter, broadcast across the room to another receiver circuit that demodulates, amplifies, and plays it. Designed by students that originally never knew what a resistor or transistor was.<p>Second half is all digital, starts with glue logic and ends with the building of a breadboard computer (68008, the 8-bit external bus flavor of 68008). We&#x27;d write assembly programs into an EEPROM and program it to do all kinds of things. Again, students that had no idea what a NAND gate was nor ever wrote a line of code.",1422432154

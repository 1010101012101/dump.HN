Aside from the fact that they currently cost more as Khosla points out -- just because a car or SUV is a hybrid, doesn't make it truly energy efficient. Auto makers are slapping hybrid engines in cars to appeal to the growing buzz about going green, when in fact, many of the hybrids out there are only a very dull shade of green.<p>Take the Ford Escape hybrid, for example. It's currently considered the most efficient SUV on the market ... getting a whopping 30mpg. 30mpg! Big friggin deal! You can get better mileage in a regular gasoline Civic.<p>The worst part about hybrids is that THEY STILL USE GASOLINE! Sure, maybe a little bit less, but as long as we are driving hybrids, we're still dependent on burning fossil fuels, contributing to CO2 in the atmosphere, and making the oil companies richer.<p>Hybrids are a marginal improvement in fuel efficiency. Marginal is not good enough to make any difference worldwide. We need to focus on orders of magnitude of increased efficiency. I believe that one day, hydrogen will be our answer. Solar electric is on a good path, too ... but still far from being feasible.<p>What can you do right now? Save your money on the fancy-shmancy hybrid, and buy a diesel car, and fill 'er up with biodiesel. It's carbon neutral, totally renewable, and requires no special modification to your car.",1189760166

Like I think I have heard that Menus are actually faster on Linux than on Windows, but on Windows it feels faster because they are animated immediately. <p>I also read somewhere of a case where designers solved the waiting problem by putting up mirrors next to the elevators. That way, people were busy looking at themselves and didn't notice the wait time as much.",1189759990

She works for a company that demands a lot (starts with G and ends with oogle), and she escapes as fast as she can at the end of the day, and so me being intent on my work when she leaves in the morning (or sleeping off a late night) and well past when she arrives home at night bugs her.  So, given that I don't want to inspire jealousy, or poke fun, or whatever, my answer is generally, ""I'm sorry.  It's just the way I am.  I'll take some time off this weekend.""",1189757887

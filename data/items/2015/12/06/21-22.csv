This reply is much more eloquent and puts it into perspective, so I&#x27;ve upvoted it. I think this is a completely valid and interesting opinion on the &quot;worth&quot; of a programmer, and it&#x27;s not one that is ever really explored. Our industry tends to focus too much on the general &quot;market value&quot; of developers without considering that they are more than the sum of their skills.<p>That said, I think you&#x27;re drawing a line where one does not exist in practice. Very few developers these days are paid to just crank out lines of code. At work, I&#x27;m not asked to write a function that takes certain inputs and returns a certain output; I&#x27;m tasked with building a feature for a product. This requires much more than the skill of knowing how to code: I have to have a good understanding of the product as a whole, how everything fits together from a technical perspective, and the end users&#x27; needs. The titles of &quot;programmer&quot; and &quot;software developer&quot; (and all the other variations) are used interchangeably because the distinction essentially doesn&#x27;t exist anymore—if you hire a programmer, you&#x27;re expecting them to know more than just how to write code.",1449438916

And it&#x27;s increasingly becoming this elephant in the room nobody wants to talk about.<p>I used to be totally in the bandwagon of &quot;those annoying vegans trying to make people feel bad for eating meat&quot;. Now I agree - why shouldn&#x27;t you shame someone for doing something bad? Buying and consuming animal products is bad for everyone involved: bad for the person eating them, the environment and the animals. We would shame corporations for polluting the environment and we would shame a person for abusing their pets in the way factory farming does animals, so why is it ok if they do it by proxy?<p>I read a nutrition book called &quot;The China Study&quot; about 6 months ago and it was the push I needed to seriously give veganism a try. I don&#x27;t deny it, I love the taste of certain meats and at times I do miss them and I do occasionally still eat fish (sushi is my favourite food).<p>I&#x27;m feeling better in every sense. I was surprised to see that my body composition is actually better now, even though my protein intake is markedly lower (I was 95kg and ~14% body fat before and am 87kg and ~10% now, judging BF% with calipers so not exactly precise), my weightlifting strength is up, my cardio endurance is improved, my skin is _hugely_ clearer and I anecdotally seem to have more energy - I definitely feel less lethargic after eating. My biggest concern was loss of muscle mass given lower protein intake, somehow I am looking better and feeling stronger than before. I&#x27;m eating around 3-600g of carbs per day (!) which is all coming from whole fruit and veg, which seemed totally ridiculous to me before coming from a close-to-paleo high fat high protein diet.<p>FWIW I&#x27;m a 22 y/o male and consume around 3-4000 cals/day and work out 5-6 times per week so YMMV.",1449438846

10686718,comment,10685641,10686634,0,0,lmm,,,"> For example, comcast uses prefix delegation to give you are /60 which your router (pfsense in my case) then uses for the internet network (it carves out a /64). However, this prefix changes! As it is not a statically assigned prefix, my internal devices renumber whenever it changes, it would make it a huge pain to get a consistent mapping for my internal devices (media server, printer, etc) were I to go ipv6 only.<p>Part of the point of IPv6 is that your addresses reflect the real network topology - when your upstream changes, your addresses change. The right thing is to ensure that your router is also updating DNS for your internal devices, and use names to refer to them. You shouldn&#x27;t expect anything to have a truly static IPv6 address.",1449437465

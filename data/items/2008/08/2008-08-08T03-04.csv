Emacs (in tuareg mode for OCaml), gnu screen with ncmpc & mpd (music), dwm window manager.<p>I merged workspaces 1 and 8 onto 4, otherwise it'd just be full-screen Emacs. (Which is how I hack, but makes for boring screenshots.)",1218167908

It was just an example.<p>I don't know a damn thing about CutCo, but having people buy their own equipment isn't just the signature of a pyramid scheme...  It's the signature of franchising as well.  Hrm.  Is McDonalds a pyramid scheme?<p>Either way, high commission ""eat what you kill and pay your own expenses"" aren't inherently evil.",1218165520

It&#x27;s quite intuitive to use, and for those rare times where a menu item is not self-explanatory, every function is well-documented online. Also, it is very good at 3D workflows - you can define your board shape from a STEP model (the easiest way to define a curvy board shape), you can have a 3D model for every component, and you can export the board to a STEP model (with or without components).",1394467177

7373650,comment,7367243,7371140,3,0,imjk,,,"What about direct media buying? With a product as niche as yours, it may be worthwhile to identify specific sites (ie candy enthusiast forums/blogs) and work out a deal for a monthly banner ad. Start negotiating with an estimated price based on their traffic numbers and your LTV, and if after a month you&#x27;re not profitable, go back and negotiate a more favorable price.<p>But aside from that, I don&#x27;t think you should necessarily give up on advertising on the larger platforms you&#x27;ve been working with. As someone with extensive experience in online advertising, I will tell you that campaigns that are break even from the start or even lose a little money often have huge potential for becoming profitable. Just getting conversions is a positive sign. Consider the full path from advertisement to checkout. There&#x27;s almost infinite room for improvement from the copy on your advertisements, to the images, to layout of your landing page, placement of buttons, size of form fields, background colors, etc etc. Then there&#x27;s all the backend changes such as lifetime value and product costs that you can create additional margin. Combine all these things and you can swing a losing campaign to a hugely profitable one. Then with additional margin you create, you have the potential to focus on scaling. G&#x27;luck to you.",1394467153

While the ones who went into management merely lamented the loss of their hard earned technical skills.<p>Anecdotal, and I know there are lots of people on HN with counter anecdotes, but think forward 10 or 20 years and see if the things you <i>don&#x27;t</i> like about your role are things you can continue to tolerate or not. The grass isn&#x27;t greener on the other side, but sometimes new problems are easier to handle than the same old problems over and over again.<p>Also, don&#x27;t make the mistake of thinking going into management will give you more agency as an employee. From a non-management position it feels like those &quot;higher&quot; than you get to call the shots, but quite often a good manager is creating space for you to get to run your day-to-day and is boxed around almost daily by those higher than they are.",1394467077

And why label all other languages as short-lived, low quality fads? Because that&#x27;s what reading the two &quot;tl;dr&quot; sections at the top indicate. He&#x27;s not doing himself any favours with that kind of statement.<p>When people (recruiters or otherwise) ask me what I do, I&#x27;m a developer. Not a C programmer, not a Rubyist, or any subset of software development. I know how to program, I know how to solve problems, and I know how to learn new languages, libraries or frameworks. Sticking to your guns in an industry as ever-changing, for better or worse, as ours, is a bad idea.<p>When I was a student, I was interested in trying out tons of new languages. I eventually ended up sticking to Ruby for most of my own projects. At university, we used Java almost exclusively. My two last jobs however, have been C and C++. I&#x27;m fond of C, but not a big fan of C++. If I had stuck to Ruby or Java, I doubt I&#x27;d have a job as interesting as the one I have now, as those to languages seem to be restricted to web development and things like low quality internal applications used by banks in my area.<p>(Unrelated: odd, I&#x27;d never hear of this guy chromatic before today.

With that viewpoint, we&#x27;re just now seeing a ~30 year mark from the start of that time period - people who started in their 20s or 30s in software are now hitting their 50s and 60s.  Watching and learning from what their careers have been will be instructive for people, although I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a whole lot of lessons we can draw conclusively from that yet.  It&#x27;s only one generation, and the world of tech changed dramatically during that generation.<p>Will this always be a problem?  I don&#x27;t know - embeddable bio-devices may be the next seismic shift, but &quot;the internet&quot; - the idea of billions of people always connected to services - this was little more than a dream in the eyes of a few people back in the 80s.  Given <i>that</i> viewpoint, the career of software developers in the &quot;always connected&quot; age of the internet has been not even 20 years.<p>Unrelated, I&#x27;ve had pretty gray hair since my early 20s, and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve been too affected by ageism, but I know it&#x27;s been a factor during some hiring - people assuming I was in my 40s or 50s when I was ... 31.  :)",1394466835

7373618,comment,7372997,7372997,4,0,moron4hire,,,"I&#x27;m 31 and I worry a lot about this issue. I live in the Washington DC area, which is extremely expensive. I am a freelance consultant, but my hourly rates are not very high. I have one client, and if someone in official IRS capacity were to look at us, they&#x27;d make my client make me a wage employee, the relationship we have is clearly not a subcontracting position. But this arrangement makes it possible for me to earn more from them than I would have as an employee. I don&#x27;t now how that works, health insurance can&#x27;t cost <i>that</i> much (I&#x27;m on my wife&#x27;s now), but everywhere I&#x27;ve been has acted like a $50k employee == $100k subcontractor. Even paying for my own health insurance, my own vacations, and deducting my own taxes, I&#x27;m still netting more than I&#x27;d gross as an employee. I don&#x27;t get it, but I&#x27;m not going to complain too loudly. And that not even getting into the cost savings I have from not driving, not eating out all the time, not getting sick all the time, etc.<p>My wife has a fulltime engineering job working for the government. We have a small condo that is just about the cheapest sort of place you can get around here without living in a rathole. We have one new car between the two of us, which works because I work from home and don&#x27;t drive (I have a 15 year old car). Between our two salaries and the fact that we cook better than most restaurants, we live comfortably.<p>But I worry about what having kids will do to us. We would certainly have to buy a house. The condo is almost too small even for the two of us right now, but &quot;fortunately&quot; I didn&#x27;t have a lot of stuff to begin with because I&#x27;ve never been paid very well. I have always risen to a head leadership position amongst developers wherever I&#x27;ve worked, but it has never turned into anything meaningful. &quot;We appreciate your work!&quot; would have a lot more meaning if it came with greenbacks.<p>If she decided to stay home, it would cut our income in half. Not to mention that we&#x27;d have to find private health insurance. I just don&#x27;t see a bigger place plus half-income working. We need to either move in-state (which she doesn&#x27;t want to do) or I need to make more money.<p>I&#x27;m reluctant to look for a job because I&#x27;ve not had good experiences working in offices. I don&#x27;t enjoy the type of work I&#x27;m doing or would get hired to do. I like programming, a lot, just not this same, old, bullshit CRUD all the time.<p>I had good grades in college. I&#x27;ve always had strong programming, math, and science skills. I&#x27;ve always had lots of interesting side projects. I get along with people really easily. And I&#x27;ve never been able to find a good match for a job. The only places that ever call me back are shotgun recruiters and consultoware dungeons. It&#x27;s disheartening.<p>I got really depressed with the consultoware field about three years ago. I lived off cash for a month while I looked for a new job, and ended up taking a huge salary cut to get into the only product-based startup that has every returned my emails. Turns out, they stuck me in their own consultoware project. After a year, they fired me without telling me why. I&#x27;m pretty sure it was because I was very unhappy, had worked it out so that none of my work was very much effort, and fell back to only putting in as much effort as was required of me, which was less than the 60 hours a week they expected.<p>I was on unemployment for a couple of months. I applied to everywhere I had ever wanted to work. I figured I had a bit of a time window and, at least in the first 2 months, wasn&#x27;t terribly desperate to have a job right away. I reasoned I could &quot;hold out for my dream job.&quot; Out of 30 job applications, not a single person called me back.<p>Eventually, a friend got me an introduction to the company he worked for at the time. I started contract-to-hire with them, and when the intro period was up, I took a chance on an ultimatum of letting me stay freelance or letting me leave, I would not take a salaried position. I&#x27;ve been working for them for 2 years now and it&#x27;s been decent. I have a good working relationship with my client, he loves my work, they pay me, I don&#x27;t go in to any offices, and sometimes the work is a little interesting. But, it still doesn&#x27;t pay very well, in the grand scheme of things. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m being paid what I&#x27;m worth.<p>It feels like the only out for me is to start my own company. I think I would really like to do that, but I don&#x27;t have the funding for it and I don&#x27;t know the right people to get funding.",1394466797

First is that the consumer web is relatively young and that our generation was the first to adopt it on a mass scale. And second, the most prominent and visible tech success stories of the past decade have revolved around social media, in which the most innovative products were heavily driven by younger demographics. This is still true; the more &quot;innovative&quot; social media products, or most widely adopted (ie Instagram, Snapchat, etc) are still heavily driven by younger demographic users. In these cases, it was important to have employees get the product, which seemed to be most adopted early by &quot;our&quot; young generation. I think as we move past the social media dominant consumer web, we&#x27;ll see less of this age discrimination.",1394466130

Most companies don&#x27;t let you take your source code with you, schools do.

At one point, he says:<p>> have the correct tools (most of which are not free)<p>One of the reasons the free software movement is so exciting is because it put professional quality software development tools into the hands of ... well, everyone, and let them unleash their creativity.  This is why Stallman started with emacs, gcc, gdb, and the unix tools.  A whole generation of programmers grew up using tools that a generation earlier would have been prohibitively expensive or inaccessible.  The frameworks, tools and libraries the OP is so excited about are the continued product of that movement.  They are free (as in beer) and, more importantly, free as in speech.<p>However, this hasn&#x27;t happened to hardware development tools yet, except for a few exceptions.  It might be starting.  (I have my pessimistic days and my optimistic ones.)  There are two classes of tools: software design tools (and firmware for hardware tools) and hardware tools themselves.  Of course, we can&#x27;t expect hardware tools to be free as in beer, but we can aspire to make them free as in speech.  Kicad (a free PCB design tool) is light years behind the industry standard Altium.  Free versions of tools for high-speed design, signal integrity analysis, etc. are basically unheard of.  The on exception might be Spice, the circuit simulator.  There are free designs for primitive hardware tools (e.g., power supplies, precision DMMs, oscilloscopes, logic analyzers), but they are nowhere near entry-level professional offerings, and many, even tho they call themselves &quot;open&quot;, don&#x27;t make design files available.<p><a href=""http://www.phenoptix.com/blogs/news/12550621-testing-the-ten-minute-open-source-test-with-kickstarters"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phenoptix.com/blogs/news/12550621-testing-the-ten...</a><p>Forget about RF-level stuff like RF signal generators and signal analyzers.

A suit of open tools (software and hardware) that benefited from community improvement would truely be transformative.  It would create an enormous amount of social value.  I can see why it hasn&#x27;t been done yet.  Building open versions of these tools would require a huge amount of work, and they are incredibly valuable, so whoever does it would have to forgo a huge amount of value.<p>I&#x27;m finishing up something else in the short term, but I&#x27;ve been thinking about this a lot.

It annoys me that I need to go back and add unnecessary explicit casting in 100 places in my project to keep Clang quiet, or face real warnings being lost in a sea of false warnings every single time I build my project. I know you can do if(var) { ... } else { ... } ... I don&#x27;t care. I want to use switch, and I legally am allowed to. Don&#x27;t bug me about it, Clang.<p>It also really hates empty statements, eg while(do_something()); warns that there&#x27;s nothing inside the while loop. I know, the important part is do_something() and its return value. Same for if&#x27;s, for&#x27;s, etc. It wants me to put the ; on its own line. Uh, no. That&#x27;s not my style at all.<p>And at the same time ... Clang caught a few bugs that GCC overlooked.<p>So, my current strategy is to build WIPs with GCC at default warnings and Clang with the sledgehammer of -w; and then before any releases, build with maximum warnings on both compilers and analyze each one for legitimate issues. I also run with valgrind to catch many other types of issues, like using uninitialized variables and memory leaks.",1394465625

They are valuing risk takers, people who know modern tech, people who don&#x27;t expect to be paid so much just because they know more less useful to the current situation skills and knowledge. The quality of a low age itself is irrelevant. It will be the same 15 years from now. Current younger people will feel more entitled to higher pay, will feel less willing to compromise or settle for jobs which their younger peers would be happy to get. Ultimately if someone brings value to a job it&#x27;s the stupidity of the employer to not understand their value. If a company can make 10x more from hiring someone why wouldn&#x27;t they? Companies which don&#x27;t hire the best value makers don&#x27;t do as well, which allows those companies which do hire those people to float to the top. It is the same thing with women. Any sane businessperson would hire people no matter their gender if those people can make them more money, and anyone who is leaving value on the table by being discriminatory despite the lost potential leaves room for their competitors to destroy them.

At some point, influence means managing. If not in title, certainly in actions.<p>> Is there a plateau in pay?\nYes and no. If you stay in the same qualification range at a given company, your pay will stagnate modulo annual increases. Move up or out to improve.<p>> Is there a drop in pay switching jobs after a certain number of years experience because places are looking for 5+ instead of 20+?<p>There can be. If you can, trade the drop for something you care about that advances your career. E.g.  2 jobs ago I took a pay-cut, but that translated into being given the responsibility to build a new team from scratch. It was something I wanted enough to take the cut, and it was a great learning experience. I subsequently traded back for money ;)<p>> Are older devs not looking for new jobs because they have families and want more stability/are focussed elsewhere?<p>Can&#x27;t speak for all - I usually pick jobs I like, at companies I like, for pay I&#x27;m OK with.

In general, the ones who want to write code do so. The ones who want to manage do so.

In the last 18 years I was happy being a developer, but over the course of the last few years I have come to the personal realization that I would need to eventually move in to a different role - I didn&#x27;t want to wait too long either. I recently got the opportunity to move in to management and don&#x27;t regret the decision. Sadly, it&#x27;s brought me to 100% management, 0% development - but I make sure to review every pull request, knowing exactly what is going on. Additionally, I still work on little side projects of my own at night/weekends - it takes care of the itch to want to code, and it&#x27;s stuff I am really passionate about.<p>As for salary - I believe I was getting close to plateauing as a developer in my area (for jobs I would want to do), and I have opened up my career and salary path a bit more.<p>Regarding looking for jobs - I moved from the agency world in my early 30&#x27;s to the startup world.

To me the real challenge in technology has always been at the intersection of business and tech, that spot where you have people with a need meeting people with capability. The business side alone is pretty boring, and the tech side at the end of the day just amounts to variations on bits and bytes. Puzzle books. (Although, like I said, I love it)<p>Being a consultant, I see a lot of older developers around. I think there&#x27;s a significant bias in the industry towards younger guys -- mainly because younger guys are the hotshots moving through development into management, and people like hiring people that look like them. [Insert long discussion here about age bias if you must. I prefer to just acknowledge it and move on.]<p>The &quot;mistakes&quot; I&#x27;ve seen from older developers come in two flavors: not specializing enough and not moving around enough. Some guys will &quot;float to the top&quot;, and become more of a surface-level generalist. This is the path I see my own technical skills leading. That&#x27;s great, but many times companies specifically want some kind of bullshit new technology because somebody thought it looked hot on HN. In that case, you&#x27;re at a disadvantage. And after a few years pass like that, sure, you&#x27;re the guy that can do anything, but only in C. That has real, solid, useful business value -- but it sucks to try to sell in the labor marketplace. I have a feeling there are going to be a lot of older startup founders over the next 30 years that fit into this mold.<p>The second way to kill yourself is to stay at one company, working on one product and one technology, longer than a couple of years or so. Pretty soon you&#x27;re the master of C++11 as it applies to real-time embedded weasel-hunting robots -- in other words, you are truly the master of something nobody else on the planet cares about. That works great until they stop making weasel-hunting robots, then it sucks.<p>I think the problem with age as a developer is the same problem you have at 22: you have to wisely balance the time and energy you spend on learning new things. You can&#x27;t learn everything and move around every other month, but you can&#x27;t stagnate either. Instead, you have to carefully watch the market and anticipate where it&#x27;s going to be in 3-4 years. As you get older, sadly, it&#x27;s just easy to stop giving a shit as much as you used to. Sure, in five years everybody will be using X, but what will they be doing with it? I&#x27;ll tell you what. In 99% of cases, they&#x27;ll be doing the same kinds of things they&#x27;re doing right now, that&#x27;s what. So after a couple of dozen rides on the &quot;Gee whiz! Is this cool tech or what!&quot; wagon, it gets tougher to get back on again.",1394464133
7373316,comment,7370912,7373045,2,0,chas,,,"I&#x27;m sorry that my explanation was so alienating to you. It was intended to be practical, but clearly I missed that mark for people without a certain amount of Haskell experience. Is there anything particularly confusing there that you would like explained?<p>The reason that I used the phrase &quot;computational context&quot; is because functors are very general. A Functor can be thought of as something that lets you translate functions with nothing special about them, just a function from a value to a value, into functions that operate correctly on non-vanilla values. Some examples of non-vanilla values (values with a computational context) are any value in a data structure (this is regular mapping over lists of values and trees of values), values that depend on external configuration or storing internal state (more useful for pure FP), operating on streaming data with functions that don&#x27;t know about how you are streaming data, operating on data that might be missing without needing a null check, operating on data that might be actual data or an error code, operating on the results of a parser.<p>To give a python example, the lift function would be a decorator that made the function it was applied to correctly operate on almost any input value you gave it. If you give it a data structure, it is applied to all values in the data structure. If you give it a generator, it creates a new generator that runs the function over each element as it is generated, something like:<p><pre><code>    return (f(x) for x in argument_generator)\n</code></pre>\nwhere f is the function that the decorator was applied to. This isn&#x27;t as popular in Python, but .then() in promises/futures is a lifting function that lifts functions operating on data to functions operating on data that may asynchronously arrive in the future or fail to arrive at all.<p>This is very practical because it allows you to write code with very little repetition or boilerplate. When someone makes a data structure or processing technique (streaming, parsing, non-determinism), they write the code to operate on values inside of the data structure or process. This code is now only located in the definition of lift/map instead of being spread between every function that wants to work with that data structure, but not take advantage of anything special about the data structure. This removes boilerplates from functions and makes them easier to read and understand. In addition, this makes functions more extensible with less work. Anyone who comes along with a new data structure or processing technique can use all of the existing functions they have without having to write a new compatibility layer between the new data structure or processing technique and their old functions. Writing lifting functions separates particular data structure or processing techniques from general functions. A function can be lifted into many different contexts without any changes. This decouples specific implementations from general functions.",1394464131

7373301,comment,7372997,7372997,236,0,bane,,,"It seems that they go a few directions:<p>The most common seems to be to try and generalize, because relearning most of your job skills every few years starts to get annoying the 20th time you&#x27;ve had to do it. It&#x27;s different when you are younger and <i>everything</i> is new, you just chalk up a major tooling change as just something else to learn. But when the next hot platform or architecture or whatever comes out you get tired of running in exactly the same place. You also start to get a long view on things, where all these <i>new</i> things coming out don&#x27;t really seem to offer any advantage to you that keeps development fun. It&#x27;s just more and more layers of abstraction and you start to see the nth demo of WebGL maxing out a 4 core modern GPU system doing exactly what you did 20 years ago with a single 32-bit core, 1/5th the transistor count and all in software. So how do you generalize? One word: management. You start to take over running things at a meta-level. You don&#x27;t program, you manage people who program. You don&#x27;t program, you design architectures that need to be programmed. You don&#x27;t program, you manage standards bodies that people will be programming against. It&#x27;s not a higher level, more abstract, language you go for, it&#x27;s a higher level, more abstract job function. The pay is usually better and it&#x27;s a natural career progression most organizations are built around. There&#x27;s lots of different &quot;meta&quot; paths you can take. And because most of the skills in them will be new to you in your late 30s, 40s or 50s, they&#x27;re at least interesting to learn.<p>The problem for some people is that these kinds of more generalized roles put you in charge of systems that do not have the sort of clear-cut deterministic behavior  you remember from your programming days. Some folks like this, and look at it as a new challenge. Some hate it and wish for their programming days again. YMMV<p>So the next most common path is to just become more and more senior as a developer, keeping down in the weeds and using decades of experience to cut through trendy BS to build solid performant stuff. These folks sometimes take on &quot;thought leader&quot; positions, act as architects or whatnot. Quite often though industry biases will engage and they&#x27;ll be put on duty keeping some legacy system alive because their deep knowledge of the system lets the company put 1 guy maintaining half a million lines of code in perpetuity vs. 10 young guys maintaining the same, who all wanting to leave after a few years to build more skills. The phenomenon is best seen as the ancient grey beard COBOL mainframe guys. Some people love this work, they can stay useful and &quot;in the game&quot;, but some hate it because it comes with the cachet of being stale and not keeping up with the times. YMMV<p>Probably the third most common path is to simply branch out and start your own gig. A consultancy or something where you get to work on different things in different places on short engagements. The money is good while it&#x27;s coming in and you get to make your own hours. At some point you decide to keep doing this till retirement (if you can keep finding work) or to grow your business, in which case you generally end up doing the meta-management thing. There are thousands of these little one-man development shops like this and I wouldn&#x27;t be at all surprised if this is more common than third on my list.<p>Probably the next most common path is to just get out of development entirely. The kinds of logic, planning and reasoning skills, plus the attention to detail required to be even a half-assed developer, can be extremely valuable in other fields. Lots of developers go into Systems security, Business Analysis, Hardware, etc. With a little schooling you can get into various Finance, Scientific or Engineering disciplines without too much fuss. The money isn&#x27;t always better in these other fields, but sometimes the job satisfaction is. Again YMMV.",1394464015

I also worry about ageism but so far I don&#x27;t feel that it has affected me yet.<p>> Do you have to go into management to continue progressing upwards in pay and influence? I know this isn&#x27;t the case at some companies (e.g. Google), but is it rare or common to progress as an individual contributor?<p>That has not been the case for me. I&#x27;m currently doing software development for a startup - the same thing I&#x27;ve done my whole career. I do get asked to provide guidance and help for younger devs sometimes, but I don&#x27;t mind that one bit, it&#x27;s actually very personally fulfilling.<p>> Is there a plateau in pay? Is there a drop in pay switching jobs after a certain number of years experience because places are looking for 5+ instead of 20+?<p>For me, so far no. I&#x27;m currently making the highest salary I&#x27;ve made yet in my career. I&#x27;ve been here for a year and a half.<p>My age has not been an obstacle to finding a job yet; I&#x27;ve had plenty of interviews and offers over the last 5 years and have chosen the places I <i>wanted</i> to work, rather than the places where I <i>had</i> to. It&#x27;s worth noting that I&#x27;m white, male and American, so I realize I&#x27;m less likely to suffer from workplace/interview discrimination with US companies than people in other demographics.<p>> Is becoming a specialist rather than a generalist the answer?<p>I&#x27;m pretty much a generalist web developer, I do backend and front end work, On a nearly daily basis I work with Ruby, Javascript, Postgres, Haml, Chef, CSS, Sass, Shell scripting, etc. I didn&#x27;t have to become a specialist to get my job, although the fact that I&#x27;ve been doing Ruby for about 10 years did help me get it. I think the answer is, just to be good at what you do, whether that&#x27;s as a specialist or a generalist.<p>> Are older devs not looking for new jobs because they have families and want more stability/are focussed elsewhere?<p>> What are the older people in your workplace doing?<p>I have two kids, 5 and 2. My coworkers are evenly split between man and women, are mostly in their 30&#x27;s to 50&#x27;s and most of them have kids too. A coworker of mine recently returned from a ~5 month maternity leave after having triplets, and we&#x27;ve been flexible about her work hours/conditions because we didn&#x27;t want to lose her. So we&#x27;re definitely not averse to having employees with families. I look for companies that have this kind of attitude to work at. It&#x27;s not as hard to find as you might think; as long as you&#x27;re good at what you do people will probably want to hire you.<p>I&#x27;m not sure to what extent my company is &quot;typical&quot; but you can at least count me as one &quot;older&quot; developer who is happily still working as a developer, was able to have a family without harming my career, and didn&#x27;t get pushed into management.<p>All in all I would say, your early 30&#x27;s is still young. Statistically you&#x27;ve got more than half of your life ahead of you, likely the best part, too. As we get older I suspect the demographics of our profession will change along with us, and there will be more older people in roles we stereotype as being for younger people.\nAt least that&#x27;s what I keep telling myself!",1394463819

I have no college experience, have been in IT for 19 years, and am now 42.<p>I was hired to my current gig 11 years ago to fill an emergency need for someone with perl and B2B experience, where I showed myself to be competent and approachable, and received a token promotion and consistent merit raises.<p>I have made all my IT hires in a similar way. In 1995 CompuServe had an immediate need for anyone who could tell a mouse from a keyboard, and due to my experience troubleshooting modem connections to play better dial-up Doom, I was put right into tech support in the ailing company. Before they imploded, I was hired at an ecommerce VAN to troubleshoot comm problems and write comm scripts for some of their software packages when they were very short on good comm help.<p>At each of the companies I&#x27;ve worked for over the last 19 years, I&#x27;ve dodged layoffs, demonstrated competence and agility, been given a single token promotion, and have been paid below the market average for my position due to not having a college degree.<p>Pluses: Haven&#x27;t been fired, laid off, aged out, or put out to pasture. I have had consistent employment, taking only two contracting gigs over the years, both while still employed full time. Plus no one gripes that I wear jeans in a business casual environment, or that I look like a hippy with my 21&quot; hair.<p>Minuses: Fewer promotions, lower average pay.<p>If I did the math of some of my peers who negotiated more pay from employers, but were then laid off during low profit years, I would either break even or end up in the black by comparison.<p>By showing competence, a sense of urgency, and willingness to keep an enterprise system healthy for the long game, I&#x27;ve done pretty well, plus no pesky student loans to pay off.<p>...but on the other hand, I haven&#x27;t written that killer app, founded my own tech firm, or otherwise found my way to riches. As 50 gets nearer, and as I cost my company more, any of that may change.

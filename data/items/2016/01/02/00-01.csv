Since I had a little free time I decided to put something together and see if anyone else thinks it is a useful idea. The idea is kind of like GlassDoor but stricly for software attributes. I think most programmers have certain attributes they want in a job (maybe they only want to work with git, or they only want to work some place that practices TDD, etc), but it&#x27;s not always easy to know what the company programming philosophy is. If you don&#x27;t know any employees you&#x27;d have to go through the interview process and try to decipher what the place is really like. It&#x27;d be better if we could get a pretty good idea before wasting time in an interview for a place we don&#x27;t want to work.<p>The way it works is you fill out a survey for the place you work (we start with questions from the Joel Test and then we&#x27;ve added some more that we could think of). You can search for a company and see all the results that have been submitted (for example <a href=""http://codehappy.info/report?company=MomCorp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codehappy.info/report?company=MomCorp</a>). All the data is anonymous and we only require a github login to prevent spamming. We chose a github account since we figured it was something many developers would already have, but this is something else we&#x27;d like feedback on. We don&#x27;t want to rank companies as many questions don&#x27;t have a correct answer, we just want to make the information easier to find.<p>The site is pretty crude as it is now as this is a true MVP since I&#x27;m not sure if enough other people want something like this. We just launched it so there isn&#x27;t really any data to search yet and so I need to see if people will fill out the survey. I&#x27;d really like some feedback especially on the questions asked in the survey and/or ideas for more questions. If this catches on I have some ideas for improvements and an advanced search option. Let me know what you think!",1451696335

10824394,comment,10823747,10823926,0,0,briandear,,,"The author of the article is your typical naïve liberal. They seriously chose to effectively be a sharecropper in Northern California? Had they actually spent any time on real working farms before they decided to jump in? The irony is that these types of people look down upon the &#x27;rednecks&#x27; of flyover country and have the audacity to think that ten measly acres is going to support two people in Northern California. They have this dream of &#x27;organic&#x27; agriculture while implicitly criticizing non organic farming. These people don&#x27;t really know the first thing about farming -- obviously. If they did, they would have had at least the common sense to do the math.<p>For the two to make a small (by Northern CA standards,) salary of $80k per year that would mean they&#x27;d have to get a profit of $8000 per acre.<p>Carrots yield about 19,000 pounds per acre grown conventionally. Organic yields are less but the higher prices roughly offset the differential. NorCal wholesaler prices are at most .32 per pound for carrots sold in 50 pound boxes. (San Fran wholesale market price as of Dec 31.)<p>That&#x27;s about $6000 yearly income (using carrots as a representative crop) per acre. That&#x27;s $60k gross. That&#x27;s assuming maximal efficiency which, given the obvious inexperience of these &#x27;farmers,&#x27; would be irrationally optimistic to expect.<p>So now you&#x27;re looking at a maximum of $60k gross for two people on ten acres. Even assuming they had zero overhead, that&#x27;s $30k per year per person. They aren&#x27;t picking ten acres of crops by themselves. They have to pay some help. They also don&#x27;t plow the fields with shovels, so they have to have equipment, fuel, etc. So their profit is pretty much poverty wage. They don&#x27;t apparently understand that 1 tractor can plow 100 acres and that same tractor could plow 10 acres. Economies of scale! That isn&#x27;t some Monsanto conspiracy, it&#x27;s just a fact of business. One they choose to ignore.<p>Are these people just stupid? Unless your ten acres are in Napa and you&#x27;re growing grapes, you aren&#x27;t making a living from renting 10 acres and growing beets.<p>The implicitly argument is that something ought to be done about this unfairness of how economics don&#x27;t treat the 10 acre farmer very well. However, as a consumer, that isn&#x27;t my problem. I don&#x27;t care if a carrot has a parchment birth certificate and a pedigree or if it&#x27;s just a carrot grown on a super farm somewhere. I don&#x27;t have a responsibility to subsidize vanity farmers. I didn&#x27;t make them rent land and try to grow stuff. They obviously don&#x27;t think through the economics before they pulled the trigger -- I&#x27;m not feeling sorry for them at all. The interesting thing is that they blame the factory farms and the &#x27;lack of a living wage&#x27; for their failure. While these same exact people are unopposed to illegal immigration which is the primary source of labor for these farms they abhor!<p>Am I assuming their politics? Yes, obviously.. But anyone who read the article knows these are the kind of people that would vote for anyone but the most liberal candidates on the ballot; the same liberals that want to increase the very immigration that results in the inexpensive labor that ultimately is putting them out of business.",1451696083

A good point to start reading there is the Japanese microbiologist that popularized the approach - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masanobu_Fukuoka"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masanobu_Fukuoka</a><p>On the output side, direct supply deals with restaurants or consumers in higher income areas (ie. possibly not local, but a large city nearby ... SF comes to mind) could be an excellent way to get higher return on individual crops by volume. Yes, this would necessitate a drive. But they probably do it now and then anyway, and it might just pay for itself. As a bonus, the article mentioned that the author&#x27;s husband was a woodworker: knocking together some rustic wooden crates for deliveries to look the part is not something difficult at scale.<p>As a bonus, these type of delivery deals can be worded &quot;by the crate&quot; and &quot;in-season&quot;, allowing more reliable distribution of crops and releasing pressure to grow things on the edge of or out of their natural season, which can necessitate higher investment, time inputs and risk on a per-crop basis.<p>I firmly believe that being relatively close to SF, it must be possible to distribute organic crops and make money.

You don&#x27;t have issues that exist in some people&#x27;s repositories and not others. You don&#x27;t have a question of who has the authoritative repository; either GitHub does, or GitHub doesn&#x27;t and there&#x27;s a note saying it&#x27;s not authoritative. You can support things like have cross-site forks, but it&#x27;s actively good for UX to have a single authoritative server for the current state of the project. (And you certainly don&#x27;t want to <i>require</i> cross-site forks, since that would make it far more burdensome to submit a single patch.)",1451695207

Core focuses is on the following:\n1) Accelerating the genome alignment process from ~45 min to <1 min. (completed)\n2) Database that allows users to compare up to 10 genomes for their differences/similarities with basepair mutations (in progress)\n3) Ability to overlay data science-y stuff (H20 framework) against up to 10 genome mutation datasets to run clustering algos (or other methods). (Q2/Q3 2016)<p>I just got a basic prototype up and running that overlays a visual interface on top of a full human genome mutation data set. Currently wrapping up a disease comparison table so that user can run intersections to find potential areas of diseases.<p>There&#x27;s lots of tools out there that do stuff like this already but they&#x27;re often in terminal, require lots of coding exp. or stats, and are really technical to use. Additionally, lots of challenges on the data front since these data sets can be between 3gb to 150gb per human genome. This makes doing comparative genomics at scale hard.<p>My hope is to build a basic prototype that is visually easy to use, straight forward, fast, and provides proper insight. The ultimate goal would be to create a platform that allows users to do massive population-based genomics (10,000 genomes+). Reason? Because it&#x27;s super fascinating and once I get my genome sequence, it will be really fun to dive into the software of me.",1451695162

I&#x27;ve been studying both GitHub and GitLab&#x27;s design in detail, because I want to incorporate my technology into their branches and commits page, and I&#x27;ve found the user experience between both quite striking.<p>When I get some time this week, I would like to submit an issue with GitLab to let them know in more detail what I think they can do better, but here is just a synopsis:<p>- I still can&#x27;t put my finger on it, but there is something off about the font.<p>- Avatars with 50% border radius is a bad design choice in my opinion.  The problem with creating circular avatars is they hide too much of the image and they create a focal point towards the center of the image.  If your avatar doesn&#x27;t have a natural center focus, it will look bad and create unnecessary eye strain, since your mind will naturally try to fill in cropped areas.  Keep it simple and use a simple border radius of 8 or less.<p>- Avatars on the commits page are too small.  I&#x27;m not sure if this design decision was the result of the Gitorious acquisition, but Gitorious had this problem as well.  Using small avatars has its place, but not on the commits page since this page is designed to help you better understand who did what quickly.<p>- How the commit message is revealed in the commits page is too jarring.  If you click on the ellipses at<p><a href=""https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/commits/master"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/commits/master</a><p>and<p><a href=""https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/commits/master"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/commits/master</a><p>you&#x27;ll better understand.  The problem with GitLab&#x27;s implementation is the strong focal point is the avatar and when you click on the ellipsis, your eyes will get dragged down with it when the message is revealed.  Just copy GitHub and use a bigger avatar and have the commits message reveal below the strong focal point (avatar)<p>- The calendar icon on the commits page is visually too strong and should be removed.<p>- The clipboard and other elements on the commits rows creates an unnatural balance/flow.  If you look at GitHub&#x27;s commits page, the clipboard, commit sha and browse tree icon are equally balanced in size and weight, which creates a natural horizontal flow.  You can sweep from left to right and it won&#x27;t create any unnecessary jarring effect.<p>This is just some of the things that I&#x27;ve thought about when I was looking at the commits page and I really don&#x27;t understand why they aren&#x27;t copying GitHub&#x27;s UI in a lot of places.  The amount of money that GitHub is investing in their UI vs GitLab&#x27;s is quite significant, and it should be obvious that GitHub is way more capable of producing a better user experience, so why not copy it?",1451694864

10824241,comment,10812332,10812332,0,0,gotchange,,,"&quot;There’s a story in the Qur’an that I thought about a lot during my first eight months in solitary confinement. In it, a group of persecuted Christians find refuge in a cave. They, and a dog they have with them, fall into a deep sleep and wake up under the impression that they have taken a nap: in fact, it’s 300 years later. One version of the story tells of how one of them goes out to buy food – and I can only imagine how hungry they must have been after 300 years – and discovers that his money is obsolete now, a museum item. That’s when he realises how long they have been absent.&quot;<p>Slightly off-topic, does he realize that this was a fable and not a true story as human beings can&#x27;t live for 300 years much less without food, water and a way to expel waste?",1451693013

10824239,comment,10822479,10824208,0,0,pcwalton,,,">  Even C programs can be kept reasonably secure by following the MISRA-C standard. You might also consider Ada, designed with type and memory safety in mind and used in defence and avionics.<p>The problem with these older systems is that they don&#x27;t support heap allocation while remaining memory-safe. (A quick Google search seems to confirm that MISRA-C is in this category.) Or, if they do support heap allocation, they use a GC to manage it. Both of these restrictions are often considered undesirable for a kernel, except in specific embedded situations in which you can get away with statically allocating all your variables. Rust&#x27;s lifetime system can ensure that you use malloc/free correctly, so it doesn&#x27;t have to wall dynamic memory allocation off into unsafe code.",1451693000

The fact that people aren&#x27;t willing to pay for it tells us that they don&#x27;t actually care as much as they claimed. This is normal: most people will tell you they care deeply about something up until the point when you ask them to open their wallet, and then they remember that they don&#x27;t care all that much.</i><p>That&#x27;s something I felt was missing from the article: No talk about their pricing.

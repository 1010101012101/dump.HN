UX, XHTML, CSS, JS, SEO and other assorted acronyms are my bailiwick (though I can dork around a bit with rails/PHP/etc).  Of course, I've also dabbled in accounting, sales, etc.<p>In my experience, a solid designer can easier keep pace with 2-3 coders (it's just that much harder to code something than it is to design it)...  Which means (in my book), that a non-coder had better be prepared to do other stuff in the early phase of the project (notably SEO, SMM, and public relations).<p>(by the way, checked out your portfolio-- nice design work!)",1192351166

We recently added Chinese translations to a pretty big chunk of our product, but it's still a long way from being a comprehensive answer for Chinese customers--so it's only a few technically savvy hosting providers that are using our stuff.<p>But, after the US and Europe (French being the most popular non-English language, so far), it's where we spend most of our internationalization efforts.<p>I'd be curious how folks reach the Chinese market in a reasonable way and on a small scale.  Our current Chinese customers found us, but since we don't speak Mandarin, we have no capacity to reach out and find new ones.",1192351118

You know what else you can't do? Thwart velociraptors. When is someone going to release a social news site which allows me, the user, to outwit a raptor? Google is, as usual, our only hope.""<p>I dunno, maybe I wouldn't be so flippant if I had invented RSS and was, apparently, in constant contact with Robert Scoble ;)",1192351080

67602,comment,58025,58025,0,0,tigerthink,,,"How does self-improvement (ala lifehack.org) fit it?  I personally think it fits very well.  The trouble is that these sorts of personal development blogs are still mainly in it for the money and they aren't scientific enough (e.g. they'll tell you what to do and maybe how to do it, but not necessarily why to do it.)<p>Also, they often focus on superficial behaviors instead of underlying thinking patterns.  For instance, here's a way of thinking that I've found to be useful: 99% of the time, there's no logical reason to feel fear in any social situation.  Whatever happens, when all is said and done, <i>it really doesn't matter what other people think of you</i>.  If that seems like a ""no-duh"" way of thinking to you, think back to when you were in high school.<p>A superficial example of this behavior is learning to meet new people.  But someone who hasn't grasped the underlying concept will have a hard time meeting people, no matter how often they read about how to meet people on personal development blogs.<p>Besides money, another reason for this personal development blog bullshit is that a lot of the bloggers are themselves in the process of figuring out how to be successful, etc.  It's much easier to write instructions for someone else than yourself, so they start blogging about what they <i>think</i> will work for them without necessarily having tried it for very long.  Thus the field of personal development can be something like an echo chamber, where the same ideas are repeated over and over.\n",1192349310

I do have some ideas for Italian things I'd like to import to the US, but that will have to wait for when/if we return there.",1192349153

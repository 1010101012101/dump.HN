But given that large, complex software projects take time and manpower to create, there is a subset of games and genres that simply cannot be developed and hope to break even.<p>It's not just the publishers 'at fault'. Developers don't want to downsize or go bankrupt, therefore they won't tend to develop games that won't let them pay wages in future.<p>There are alternative funding methods, but before kickstarter it was mostly arts grants and the like. Tale of Tales have developed several small art games on art grants, IIRC.<p>> If you have a large publisher funding your project, then you aren't an indie title.<p>No, not at all. ThatGameCompany are an indie company but Journey was bankrolled by Sony. Does that mean that it's not an indie title? Fez was created by Polytron, published by Trapdoor and distributed by Microsoft. I wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft at least partially funded the XBLA version of Minecraft. DoubleFine's Brutal Legend was paid for by Activision, then dropped and picked up by EA (a big court case ensued). As I mentioned above, Tale of Tales have developed games using government money.

It somehow says in a very obtrusive way that you want to f$%#, that you are anytime ready to f$%#, yeah it just says that you are so desperate and unf$%#$% that any f$%# is welcome. And that's definitely not the way to get laid (for men at least).<p>Sorry, but who should buy this? 12yr old kids?<p>However, I think that the OP learned a lot, so it should have been a good entrepreneurial experience in any case.",1357358685

If I ever have issues, I'm meet personally with them to straighten them out.<p>But to be perfectly clear, the best thing I could ever ask for is the ability to see my professors work live. One of my professors was a high-up manager for a very large insurance company, and the other was a good friend of Edsger Dijkstra, among others. One is an immense source of advice in practical software engineering, and the other can usually teach me a pattern to solve a problem in ten-times less code and more efficiently.<p>And, due to the small size of my school, my semester-ly tuition is less than $2k. It might not look like much on a resume, but I've hit the jackpot of schools.",1357358676

5011515,comment,5011198,5011198,5,0,mark242,,,"Since June, when the presentation was created, Play has gone through a few big revisions. The primary method of accessing a database is Anorm (which, if you aren't a Hibernate fan, Anorm is a huge win) although you can also use Hibernate, or you also have the choice of using Slick, which is Typesafe's ORM (and a lot easier to use). IntelliJ 12 has better support for Play as well, and the overall performance has improved a great amount.<p>It's too bad that the presentation doesn't include sample Scala code for Play; imho this is the number one reason to use Play. The saveRating() controller method that they use as Play's example, which is some twenty lines of Java code, could be done in one or two lines of Scala code. Similarly, running a job in Play is essentially just spinning up an Akka actor and scheduling messages to send to it-- very very straightforward.<p>Play has been extremely easy to work with, especially with writing Scala code, and it's much more lightweight compared to, say, the Lift framework.",1357358541

Lower inputs of resources (including time) and higher output (meaning, hopefully, less hunger and lower food prices) would seem to translate to the higher availability of resources to allocate to other ventures.<p>If communities are freed from the pressure of scraping together their next meal, doesn't that fundamentally change their health and economic prospects?<p>[1] Or any specialized cultivar, for that matter.",1357358489

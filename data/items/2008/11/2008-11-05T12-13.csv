I could say the same thing to you about the ""human slaves"" problem, do you just not care? Why don't you do something about it instead of wasting your time making this thread here.<p>For things like this it's pointless to go out and convince people to help solve these ""problems"". The kind of individuals that would work on these problems are already doing so, and those that aren't already won't work on them even if you ask them. Kinda funny how free will works like that.<p>Now if you really want to make a difference, think before you post. Go to some chemical engineering entrepreneurial conference and make a speech there instead. Programmers aren't going to be able to solve the ""water problem"" no matter how much you want them to.",1225889571

I do understand the ""water problem"" as you call it is enormous and multifaceted.  There are people and groups that care about it and are doing things.<p>If your frustration in posting ""here"" is that HN seems to be focused on Web 2.0 stuff that has little direct effect on ""real problems"", well, you are somewhat correct.  HN, just because it has lots of smart people willing to take entrepreneurial risks doesn't mean those people come here to figure out how to use their ""charity time"" to great effect.<p>I really think that the best place to find people passionate about the water problem is with groups already organized on it.  Believe me, you _will_ find some very smart and courageous people in those groups.  Don't get discouraged because HN may not be the best outlet for you to plug into.<p>BTW, I have thought about various aspects of clean water issues.

I usually ignore critique from people who are not a personal example of what they are preaching. So would you please tell us how you put your money/brain/lifestyle where your mouth is or else just SHUT UP!
Oh and by the way entrepreneurs are people who try to create a profitable business. It might save the world or it might produce toilet paper, but if it's not making money, they can't be called entrepreneurs. So if you want them to solve any problem you consider important, don't ask them to give away money, tell them how to make more money by solving it.",1225888117

Realistically more like approaching $1.<p>So let me get this straight - pick n companies that are the most effective at sucking up to the govt, give them grant money, while hurting the rest of the (total - n) companies in the country, some of which will actually be profitable.<p>I don't have an intrinsic problem with the govt investing in start ups, getting their returns as tax dollars (I don't think it's the governments role, but if they were profitable I wouldn't have a problem with it), but when will they wake up and realise that they're no good at it?",1225888107

354430,comment,354406,354406,0,0,numair,,,"Here's the thing.  Problems that can be solved via software are problems for which we can sit in our bedroom/office/deck on the beach and work out a solution.  In fact, with the advent of virtualized servers, we can plan, create, implement and scale these solutions without leaving our chair.  Physical problems, such as the water problem, are not so easily solved - you have to deal with people and physical goods and regulations and politics.  This means it costs a lot, both in money and in effort - and, as a result, it also means there is an order of magnitude more risk associated with it.  Of course, the guy who goes out and solves these problems receives [or should receive] outsized rewards for going where few men dare to go (either monetarily, or in terms of social significance), so there's still a group of people focused on such problems.  Maybe not as many as are focused on this tech-Internet stuff, but again - there's simply not the same sort of automated, virtualized systems available to make toying around with such tasks easier.<p>Also, we haven't even begun to discuss the high level of social skill needed in order to successfully execute an on-the-ground, real-world, third-world venture; I'm personally not sure I would put awkward geeks in charge of such a thing.  (And yes, I'm making a gross generalization, but it's 4:00am, so cut me some slack!)",1225887646

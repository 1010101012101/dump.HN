Obviously, has not been effective.<p>I would posit the reason phone manufacturers are <i>paying</i> royalties as opposed to <i>cross licensing patents</i> is because Microsoft doesn't have enough market share for HTC, LG, (Google?), etc. to make it worth while for manufacturers to trade their patents for.<p>In other words, phone manufacturers see $10 (a guess) per phone payed to Microsoft today is cheaper <i>in the big picture</i> than licensing WP7 instead of Android on those phones.  In addition, it implies they value their own patents more than that amount and thus refuse to cross license their own patents to instead of paying the Microsoft royalty.<p>The logical conclusion is that phone manufacturers have looked in their crystal balls and bet strongly against Microsoft.  They are betting that, in five years (a guess), Microsoft will be out of the phone software business and their patents will be irrelevant because they have either expired or been worked around.<p>The phone manufacturers are also remembering the iPhone vs. Windows Mobile / Windows Phone timeline and remembering how long they were getting buried by Apple because <i>Microsoft</i> was not able to sell them a credible alternative to the iPhone.

Given certain axioms, you might be able to logically derive the answer that ""piracy"" should not be punished.<p>If I understand you correctly, you're arguing that piracy is illegal, and prevents authors to be payed.<p>But just because something is illegal, doesn't mean it's right. Provided a law is morally wrong, for instance, punishment for breaking said law would also be morally wrong, and should not be supported. You'll probably also cheer to the freedom fighter breaking laws to overcome a dictator.<p>Interestingly, most Americans would probably deny that anybody has a right to have income, or a minimum level of wealth and health in every other profession (for this would be ""socialism""). So, why should authors and investors in creative works have that right?<p>After all, the authors of most works have been payed. Most of the time, even the investors in these works have been paid as well. What you argue is basically that authors and investors haven't been paid 'enough'. But how do we rationally determine what payment is 'enough' or not?<p>Of course, these ""pirates"" are fooling themselves if they think their moral arguments hold.

They understand that content is a non-rival good, that unlike an apple, they can consume it without diminishing anyone else’s ability to consume the same thing. They know that the content owner paid nothing to reproduce or distribute the content on the Internet. They also know that the artists who created the original content get a tiny fraction of the revenue. So they are making a moral judgement that the content owners are pricing their product to extract unjustifiable profits and they feel morally justified taking the content they find out there on the web."" <a href=""http://bradburnham.tumblr.com/post/12739727902/i-believe-in-the-internet-the-content-industry"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bradburnham.tumblr.com/post/12739727902/i-believe-in-...</a><p>File sharing has just been recognized as a religion in Sweden too and all.<p>In any case, something is very, very wrong here.

I don't know. Maybe she violated a direct court order. Once a judge tells you to do something, after hearing you out, you have a limited time to get a case started in a higher court, or comply. If you don't go to a higher court, the decision of the judge actually takes precedence to any law for you personally.<p>If you don't obey that court order, force can and will be used to make you comply. The law states that this force should be reasonable considering the offence (the offence in this case would be disobeying a judge, not copyright infringement. This is a very serious offence, and it's a criminal offence, not a civil one). If a certain amount of force does not work to make you comply, stronger force will be used until you comply.<p>E.g. enforcing a restraining order. Starts with a polite request. That doesn't work, they do it in writing. If you still don't, the police is authorized to stop you physically a few times (like pulling you over).

The main argument being that they transit the route faster overall because they have a much shorter dwell time at stops. The introduction of bendy buses was a rational evidence based decision, the campaign against them was mostly emotional hubris, which resulted in them being replaced early at vast expense to the taxpayer. The main reasonable complaint against them was that you were more likely to have to stand up, but you often couldn't even get on the bus (e.g's routes 73,38) before they were introduced so I don't know what's worse.",1326550273

If you're going to stop international piracy, you need to encourage other countries to pass DMCA style laws, not anything more draconian like 3-strikes laws. The DMCA has allowed innovation in technology to happen while still providing a method for take-down that results in a judge seeing it if it is contested.<p>I understand they're trying to find middle ground, but there really is no middle ground to be had. I also contest the idea that it's actually harming jobs. During the economic downturn the media industries have been doing just fine, much better than the rest of the economy.

Basically, she had to resort to a copyright infringement lawsuit because copyright holders are the only group with more lobbying power than online service providers.<p>The courts have apparently interpreted it broadly enough to bar people from getting an injunction requiring the site to take down the offending content when they would otherwise have a basis for doing so. There&#x27;s a whole bunch of entirely legal online extortion businesses built on this simple fact; the most prominent lawyer fighting these revenge porn sites - Marc Randazza, who advised her - is actually doing so on behalf of one of them and so has incentive to preserve Section 230 of the CDA.",1385272517

6788851,comment,6787807,6787807,13,0,ohmygodel,,,"I think it&#x27;s cool that you&#x27;re making usable security software.<p>I do worry that &quot;usable&quot; has gotten more thought than &quot;security&quot;, and providing a system that doesn&#x27;t deliver the security it promises could be worse than not having the software at all. It may end up conveniently serving up those at most risk to their adversaries.<p>As others have noted, anonymity is hard to get right, and the approach here has some serious flaws:<p>1. It seems that the pseudonymous author of posts can easily be determined by connecting a bunch of Sybils (i.e. multiple clients) to as many other peers as possible and observing who is the first to send new posts by the target pseudonym. And you really can&#x27;t have a forum without pseudonyms. Users will create them on their own (by including a nickname in their posts) even if you don&#x27;t build it in.<p>2. There is an easy so-called &quot;intersection attack&quot; in which the sets of users that are connected at any given time a pseudonymous entity posts are intersected. The actual author will always be present, and the other participants won&#x27;t be static, and so eventually only the author will remain in the intersection.<p>3. There is no apparent protocol obfuscation. Despite the use of TLS, the protocol traffic patterns of this new protocol are likely to be highly identifying. They can then be easily confirmed by an active attacker directly connecting to the suspected participant. In addition, it doesn&#x27;t seem that the list of participants is protected, and so an adversary can just connect to the network to discover who to block or punish. Tor will not solve the problem here if users have to be able to receive incoming connections. And if you&#x27;re using Tor, then you are relying on an external system that has censorship issues of its own (e.g. access from China is currently extremely limited) and <i>does</i> rely on servers.<p>4. The bootstrap IPs can obviously be easily blocked.<p>5. The votes are not anonymous, which is unlikely to be clear to users and which are nearly as sensitive as authorship itself.<p>6. Denial-of-service here is as simple as flooding the network with &quot;forwarded&quot; posts and votes.<p>Here are some suggestions for designing a system that is secure and that people can <i>trust</i> as being secure:<p>1. Write a white paper describing the design! This is not a detailed protocol spec - it&#x27;s a description of how the protocol works at a higher level along with arguments establishing its security properties. This allows others to understand and critique the design.<p>2. Check out some of the related system designs [0-6]. They have had to deal with the same issues, and you can learn from them. You can get all these papers and more at <<a href=""http://freehaven.net/anonbib/>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freehaven.net/anonbib/></a>. As you can see at that site, people have been thinking about these issues for a while and have figured out a lot!<p>3. Submit your white paper to a computer security conference. Even if it doesn&#x27;t get in, you will get feedback from experts.<p>As it is currently, I wouldn&#x27;t trust my communication to this system. You really need a large and diverse user base to provide anonymity, and so you will have to work at convincing people that this is something they can trust.

If the left doesn&#x27;t talk about statism, I think it is a testimony to either their pragmatism or their shortsightedness. If one sees the state as the wielder of the monopoly on &quot;legitimate&quot; violence, then conceding to its existence makes it rational to expect that such violence will be used in the interest of one&#x27;s self within the vaguely agreed constraints of moral conventions. Thus the poor can expect the taxing of some real estate as a way to keep housing affordable, while the rich can expect the police to keep the homeless off their property. True anarchists see a compromise in both instances, and a form of short-term progress in the first one.",1385271737

I realize that this is the stock definition, but I find it unconvincing and dangerously misleading.<p>Humans are good at rationalization, and bad at self-reporting. &quot;No guilt&quot; and &quot;no empathy&quot; can be explained by bravado and self-delusion.<p>Instead, my model goes something like this: there&#x27;s a spectrum of selfishness. The people we label psychopaths have certain selfish desires that outweigh (for them, sometimes) your human rights. E.g. in an extreme case, an abuser&#x27;s desire for sexual gratification is more important to them than your right to not be molested.<p>Dialing it back, consider people who text while driving, or who rush through a yellow light when they could easily stop. In that moment, they aren&#x27;t seeing the vehicles around them as  being occupied by people with all the same rights as themselves. They see vehicles ... nuisances ... obstacles to be routed around. They temporarily lack empathy.<p>If you go looking for it, there&#x27;s a lot of sociopathic behaviour on display in daily life, from people who we would never label psychopaths, nor completely lacking empathy.<p>So, I think that psychopaths are people who are extremely selfish in some specific ways, but that they are not fundamentally &quot;other&quot;.",1385270324

It also helps immensely that you can be confident about your privacy. Just getting it out sometimes is what you need. None of the therapists I dealt with when going through anxiety/depression issues really grokked what was going on in my head (my impression, but perhaps, like a parent, they really did know all along). However, a few 45 minute sessions of speaking and prompting got things off my chest, and my mind redirected on far more positive things than &quot;I&#x27;m not good enough&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m going to die alone&quot;, &quot;No one would miss me if I didn&#x27;t wake up tomorrow&quot; and other delightful thoughts.",1385269724

Even if you are very very very sure that the service is not going to make you into a Christian, that does not matter since the church will be pretty sure of the opposite. Plus you&#x27;re not taking anything away from anyone, there is no reason to feel guilty.<p>As shorthand advice: try to find a mission church in your area. A mission church expects newcomers from the area and should be welcoming. If on the off chance the church you attend feels unwelcoming for any reason you should try a different church. All churches are run by sinful humans and sometimes that works out better than others, sometimes not.",1385269623

Those might be easier to participate in. For instance, in the area I&#x27;m in, the local Roman Catholic community has a young adult group. They do the bible study things, but also pure social activities and service activities. Joining that group led to joining a soccer team which greatly expanded my social circle in the area outside of coworkers (all <i>much</i> older than me at that job, 20+ years) and a small group of RPG buddies. Who I mostly didn&#x27;t interact with outside the Saturday game, again mostly the age difference. Two were 5-10 years younger, the rest were 10-20 years older.",1385269300

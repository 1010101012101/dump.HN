They're unhelpful and they always push back!  They're arrogant!""<p>While these traits might describe <i>some</i> programmers.  They also describe some accountants, and some architects, and some mechanics, and some janitors, and some widget makers.<p>It's frustrating sometimes that the burden falls on the programmer (or tech) to try and find a metaphor that the user understands, rather than the user trying to have a <i>basic</i> understanding of their computer.<p>I'm currently working on a project that involves processing some really big datasets (okay, probably not that big for some people around here...but bear with me..).  It starts as some text files with ~260 million rows of data.  We're just in the beginning/test/planning phase, and this will eventually grow to >1 billion.  People (non-tech) people in our group keep INSISTING that we use <i>this</i> database engine, or THIS hardware configuration (raid 0...which as already failed).  They refuse to listen to those of us that know what we're doing.  They insist that all of this data should live in one huge table (rather than our suggestion of either scaling it our horizontally, or using a directory tree and supplementing it with an index that lives in a database).<p>Does this mean that we're bad communicators?  I think not.  I think that there is SOME burden to make sure that everyone understands everything that falls on us, but certainly not all of it.  We need to be met halfway.<p>The same goes for the ego.  Do I have a huge ego?  No, but I know for 100% certain that I'm more knowledgeable about these things than some of my colleagues.  I also know that I am no expert on it.  I'm open to suggestions, just not those that aren't based in any sort of basic understanding.",1247072309

Sometimes these sites will require ongoing maintenance, but many times these are one-off creations that have no requirement for future enhancement.  I've hosted some of these sites in my own shared hosting account ... but for these 'build-it-and-forget-it' sites with no prospect of future development I'd prefer to setup the site's hosting so that the web site owner is responsible for the hosting account and I don't need to maintain the relationship with the client.  In other words, I don't want to have to go back to these clients a year from now, and ask them to pay the annual hosting charge that just hit my credit card for the hosting account I setup for their site.  On the flip-side, I've found it difficult to have non-technical clients order the correct hosting since they usually don't know what they need, and it's not an ideal solution to be asking them for their credit card information so that I can place the order myself.<p>An alternate solution is to order the hosting myself, then transfer everything over to their name and credit card ... but that still feels like a less than elegant solution to what must be a very common problem .... and even with that solution, I've experienced cases where the hosting company still charges my card despite telling me they had switched everything to the client's name.<p>Without hosting these sites in your own accounts, how do you guys go about getting the hosting-angle of thigs setup for clients in these types of scenarios?",1247071191

There exist some pretty exciting technologies for cheap, namely FPGA boards and SOC (system on a chip... and/or nano-itx).  These make a very large portion of hardware design much simpler. We can suddenly apply software rapid development techniques to board design with the FPGAs. Further the SOC makes much functionality within a product just software development.<p>Further, there are many exciting ""hobby kits"" which make gadgets very creatable and testable, since they allow for easy plug-and-play hardware creation. This sort of thing makes prototyping very very easy, and the rest can be outsourced pretty well. Sure there are complications that I know nothing of, but I think there is an abundance of supply chain for a lot of projects, making small hardware companies totally possible.<p>A slightly different perspective on the above: I beleive there exists at least one market that can be exploited by putting together existing big components in fun new ways.",1247070081

Basically because we were able to quickly patch and release in order to fix high-profile BBC pages. This isn't a criticism of jQuery, but it shows the benefit of us being devoted to the BBC.<p>The BBC will always have to support older browsers because of our users. I think it would be unfair to ask other libraries to hang back with us (I'd much rather they advanced actually), and I wouldn't want to be using a library that left us behind.<p>At the moment, our support table is actually closer to other libraries' than it has ever been, that support gap will naturally increase and decrease over time.<p>We're not trying to steal your thunder at all, although I can see why it may have came across like that. My advice to developers is: use the library which has the most features you require. Whichever you pick, request the features that are missing.<p>With all the libraries innovating and others taking note, the quality of all libraries increases. Having one library to rule them all doesn't drive things forward, a good example of this is when IE6 was the only major browser, browser development stagnated.<p>We're not about filling a void in the market, but filling a void at the BBC.

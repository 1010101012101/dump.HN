For the kinds of elections that are currently conducted, the current ballot systems may be sufficient, and even preferable, as other posters have argued.<p>In my opinion, research into new, more technical voting systems are not about our existing elections, but about new types of &#x27;assessments of opinion&#x27; (AOO) differentiated from the current understanding of an &#x27;election&#x27;.<p>For example, current systems assume that &#x27;elections&#x27; occur relatively infrequently, are restricted to a certain number of choices, and that the person voting is sharing only their own opinion.<p>However, if we wanted to implement a system in which legislative decisions (proposing and passing laws, let&#x27;s say) were made by the population as a whole, possibly several times per day, in a geographically distributed manner and supporting both direct and indirect delegation, any system that is intrinsically based on a paper ballot is not a feasible solution. Perhaps we&#x27;d also want to support conditional delegation as well; for example, this person receives my vote for topics localized to a 30 mile radius, while person B receives my vote for topics related to privacy protections, and so on (with additional rules for preemption/disambiguation, etc).<p>It wouldn&#x27;t even necessarily have to be used for traditional governance - it could scale to be used for voting with a group of friends, a business, a shared-interest group, etc.<p>This is obviously a very tricky problem to solve, particularly if you add (optionally?) other requirements such as verifiability, secrecy, and so on. I haven&#x27;t read the full PDF posted by the author, but I think it&#x27;s likely that the proposed system solves only a portion of the problems described above, given the complexity of the requirements.<p>That being said, I certainly don&#x27;t think saying &quot;paper is always the way to go, because it&#x27;s the simplest&quot; or &quot;these kinds of developments are solutions in search of a problem&quot; are constructive. Addressing the weaknesses of a specific solution is one thing, but saying that the existing ballot system is optimal (particularly given the audience of HN) is a surprising sentiment to see here. Sufficiently long-standing problems (are capitols necessary?) may not be immediately visible to us, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they aren&#x27;t there, and we should strive to be open-minded - even towards imperfect solutions.<p>Just my 3 cents.",1445705822

The college offers 26 different study programs to students in the Maldives, from short term courses to internationally recognized diplomas, and is growing rapidly.\nThe Maldives is an archipelago of 1,192 islands dispersed across a 34,749 square mile territory. Great distances between the islands makes transportation within the country complicated. Maldivian students would have to spend hours making their way to a single educational institution and full-time tertiary education is not widely available. Mandhu College have taken an innovative approach to this challenge and created a specialized &#x27;Virtual Campus&#x27; to facilitate distance learning.\nMandhu College&#x27;s Virtual Campus required a number of specific features in a video conferencing solution. The solution had to be very stable, have the features to teach classes in video conference mode using collaboration tools, and be easily scalable. After exploring the market for video conferencing products providing distance learning, college IT experts decided on TrueConf Server.\nEvery day more than 50 teachers give distance classes in video conference mode from two cities – Malé and Laamu Gan. The most widely used conference types are symmetric 25-to-25 participant conferences, asymmetric conferences with one host, and role-based conferences (1 host and 20 participants). In order to improve the learning process, collaboration tools are used during online lectures: slide shows, screen sharing and a whiteboard. Lectures are recorded so that students have the opportunity to revise the lesson material when the classes are over.\nBadruddeen Naseem, Head of IT at Mandhu College says: “TrueConf implementation saves us time on troubleshooting and gives us more time to teach. TrueConf is a reliable video conferencing solution which we do not hesitate to recommend.",1445705227

Especially for someone who went from a lower middle class family in one of the poorest states in India to becoming the CEO of Google.<p>When a group of very smart people get together, there is a tendency for them to try to show themselves as being the smartest. This can lead to less-desirable situations where people don&#x27;t share or cooperate as freely as they should. In the worst cases the situation could become antagonistic with individuals or entire teams and departments refusing to talk to each other. Now in a group of smart people, walks in a person like Sundar Pichai, someone without ego,  who always defers to the other person, who might put himself/herself down to make the other person feel better. When two people in the group get into a conflict on an issue (remember this is a group that can get into religious wars over which brace style to use), it will be that person who mediates and gets the team going again. When the team has to vote on a new leader, that person is likely to get the most votes because he/she is the person everyone has the least issues with. Such a person who avoids conflict is able to act as <i></i>transcendental<i></i> force. People are more willing to listen to such a person or do what he/she says because they don&#x27;t feel threatened by him/her.<p>Someone like Steve Jobs who always puts himself above everyone else, could also act as a transcendental force as long as people agree to that. But if someone like Steve Jobs was to start at the bottom of the organisation, and moves up the ladder to its top position, it would be by putting other people and teams down. These people might harbour a grudge or ill-will and be less likely to do what the new boss says. It is not a strategy  without its downsides  (For example why did someone as incredibly gifted as Steve Wozniak end up leaving Apple?).<p>By promoting similar people to leadership positions, Pichai is creating a environment where people with great talent but less taste for politics can also get their voice heard. I think such an environment is good for creativity to flourish.<p>&quot;A good leader takes a little more than his share of the blame, a little less than his share of the credit.&quot;",1445704567

This can be interesting performance wise because instead some setters can be quite costly. Text is an obvious example, it might seem trivial but correctly rendering text is very complex, so if you can skip a setText instruction, you might gain some time on your UI computation, allowing you to more easily stay in the 16 ms timeframe. Even very good UI code usually does not optimize that much.<p>-binding code is often not very interesting : &#x27;if name not empty then setText, otherwise set visibility to gone&#x27;.  Reducing the number of code needed to achieve this is a good win, productivity wise.<p>If I am entirely fair, there are 2 things I strongly dislike about DataBinding :<p>-The binding code appears in the layout files. Keeping code and layout separates was a very good idea. It seems that the UI Frameworks team thinks that it is an acceptable compromise though, so I am ready to give them the benefit of the doubt.<p>-I wish to use something better than XML for layouts. Performance wise it does not matter since the compiler transcodes the XML layouts files in a more optimal binary format, but it is unwieldy at best for human writers & readers. The noise/signal ratio is just very poor and it lacks some features, for example letting us make some operations in the layout declarations &#x27;width = dimensionA + dimensionB&#x27; would be very useful (it is of course doable in a custom view&#x27;s code, but it would save us some boilerplate code to directly allow us to do this declaratively in a layout).",1445702642

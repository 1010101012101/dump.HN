7226005,comment,7225363,7225834,3,0,RyanZAG,,,"Is this still a limitation? I haven&#x27;t run into any use cases where this has been a problem yet. Since the default shards are 10 and 2 replicas, does that not mean each index should be able to scale up to 20 servers? I&#x27;d think that if your data grew enough that 1/10th does not fit on a server, you could do a one time maintenance and rebuild all your servers.<p>I have my doubts mongodb would scale up that well to 20+ servers without some maintenance as well. So I&#x27;m not sure how that&#x27;s really a limitation anyone should use for choosing mongodb or ES. If you&#x27;re expecting that kind of data, just make a large number of shards in your index creation as it will work fine on fewer servers too?",1392227988

There is no natural right to vote — not in the same way we have a natural right to speech or defense or anything else of that manner.<p>Democracy is dangerous. Our founding fathers despised true democracies, which is why they founded this country as a Constitutional Republic, and notably one that not everyone <i>could</i> vote. Many call them racist and sexist, and no doubt that was part of it, but they also understood that having a bunch of uneducated people voting could be disastrous. NO ONE should be allowed to vote your natural rights away, yet you see this in democracies all the time. You&#x27;re right, though, the trick is figuring out an acceptable way to proof voting privileges.<p>Even the word &quot;democracy&quot; didn&#x27;t come into popular use until the progressive era.<p>So yes, when we follow true Constitutionalism, voting is important because we should be selecting our leaders to uphold that limited government. But in our current system, we&#x27;ve given government so much power that we allow people to elect leaders that are going to give them the most, all whilst selling off the power they have taken from us to companies that want to protect their business model.<p>And once again, you really need to stop doing the whole, &quot;I&#x27;m surprised you aren&#x27;t smarter&quot; bit.",1392227971

You can capture massive numbers of passwords trivially by simply logging and unencrypted stream, but full MitM requires more time, effort, and resources to accomplish.<p>2) MitM attacks can sometimes be detected, either at the time of the attack or in the future due to repeated opportunities for the attack discovered.

This makes the upgrade path to full, properly authenticated crypto much smaller.<p>All of these benefits are worthwhile, so please, stop encouraging the use of plaintext. The proper way of handling this is not to scare people away like Firefox currently does, but to encrypt everything automagically, so it works just like unencrypted HTTP, and only <i>show the lock icon if full authentication has happened</i>.

For example, a recent tweet [1] by musician Lorde ended with the words &quot;o i am laffin&quot; which has since become a sort of alternative to &quot;lol&quot; on 4chan&#x27;s music board (especially when a given thread is about Lorde herself). It became a meme not because karma reinforced its popularity and not because moot or any other admin endorsed it, but because enough anonymous people thought that it was funny that they ALL want to keep posting it for no good reason.<p>moot mentions snapchat in the article, which I think is related in a fundamental way to what has made 4chan successful. I&#x27;ve had snapchat since June, and the way I use it with my friends is to share small jokes and the tiny frustrations of modern life. This is stuff that is amusing enough that I want a few people to see what I&#x27;ve written once, but not so funny that I think it should exist for eternity online. But it&#x27;s always been more about the jokes for my friends and me than about security.<p>Apparently I&#x27;m not alone. When news got out about the snapchat leaks[2], many people thought that this would be a damaging blow to Snapchat. These were people who I assume don&#x27;t use snapchat very frequently. To me, it never mattered that the photos leaked, because there&#x27;s so much noise in the snapchats that it&#x27;d be difficult, I am thinking, to use the data maliciously. The worst thing is that the database of snapchat ids leaked, so people can spam snaps to people they don&#x27;t know. But this is not a problem that is difficult to deal with.<p>Point is, moot is right about nobody in silicon valley really understanding the value of anonymity. While the Mr. Altman was discussing the negative face of people shedding their identity (e.g. people with bones to pick doing so anonymously in public) he didn&#x27;t see the positive benefits that moot describes. Perhaps a gossip app is not the best place to see creativity blossom on the internet.<p>I want to relay one last anecdote from my time on 4chan:<p>4chan has an advice board (/adv/[3]) that is as anonymous as the rest of 4chan[4]. On this board, people ask for advice. Often it&#x27;s relationship problems, even more often it&#x27;s the problems of sad men who like girls but have no idea how to transition from that point to a relationship with one of them. If Mr. Altman&#x27;s hypothesis that &quot;Anonymity breads meanness&quot;[5] were true, one would expect this board to be full of people just trolling depressed neets. While that does happen from time to time, more often than not it&#x27;s full of people genuinely trying to help these people that they don&#x27;t know and have never met. They expect nothing in return, but they are a fully anonymous community that just tries to help people who feel they don&#x27;t have anywhere better to ask for help.<p>Maybe anonymity isn&#x27;t so bad.<p>[1] <a href=""https://twitter.com/lordemusic/status/430186358930292736"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/lordemusic/status/430186358930292736</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/46-million-snapchat-usernames-phone-numbers-reportedly-leaked/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/46-million-snapchat-usernames-ph...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://boards.4chan.org/adv/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boards.4chan.org/adv/</a> (probably NSFW)<p>[4] there are actually different levels of anonymity on 4chan, but, for the most part, everybody is more or less completely anonymous with each post.<p>[5] <a href=""http://blog.samaltman.com/anonymity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.samaltman.com/anonymity</a>",1392226855

Timelines are very important in understanding how knowledge flows from group to group and from generation to generation. In particular, these things need to be highlighted:<p>- Computers became commercialized around 1952-54. Immediately prior to that, physicists hired programmers for the clerk work of coding up their problems (interesting note: they usually were women. You can find the story online of the programmers who worked with von Neumann. It&#x27;s very interesting).<p>- Business adoption was pretty good! In fact, by the late 60s, software was exhibiting its standard characteristics - buggy, late, expensive, hard to control. See the NATO conference on software engineering, 1968.<p>- In the early 60s, dynamic languages came about in the form of Lisp. This did not take off until, AFAIK, Perl started making headway in the 90s.<p>- Cobol, Fortran, and others that I don&#x27;t remember were standard in the 50s & 60s. And everywhere. These preceded the foundation of computer science as an academic discipline, which became institutionalized in 1969, give or take.<p>- Where did these business developers come from? I don&#x27;t have job ads, but in my readings from the journals of the times, academic work seems to have gone on fairly apart from the line of business development.",1392226342

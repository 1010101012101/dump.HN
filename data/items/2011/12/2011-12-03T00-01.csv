3306490,comment,3304847,3305569,7,0,JoshTriplett,,,"One way to look at it: in some ways Git provides a framework for almost any workflow you could possibly want.  It optimizes for workflows that major users of Git care about, such as the model followed by the Linux kernel and adopted by many other projects.  But Git won't enforce very much structure on you; you impose that on yourself.  As a result, you can use it almost exactly like SVN, at which point it'll feel like a gratuitously different SVN.  However, as you find and make use of the other possibilities available to you, you'll have more success using Git.<p>Some of the first things you'll want to look at: doing many small commits, using many lightweight branches, and using commit --amend or rebase -i on local changes to fiddle with them before pushing them.  Think of each branch as the result of your work, despite it containing many commits; you can edit the branch as a whole until you get it right, and then push it, much like you'd edit the SVN working copy until ready to run ""svn commit"".  You get to have more structure in your working copy, and keep that structure when you push to the public repository.<p>One big recommendation, though: learning Git works a lot like learning the UNIX command line.  You can learn a pile of individual tools, but it also helps to know the philosophy of how they fit together, so you can more easily string together impressive ad-hoc solutions when you need to.  I'd suggest reading more about Git's repository structure, and thinking about it more as a DAG, and how the commands fit in that model.",1322873913

3306475,comment,3304512,3305222,39,0,dissident,,,"Public info also makes it easier to steal a domain.<p>Long ago, I (being childish) stole a domain from some random person who pissed me off in a video game. I spent three days calling the registrar's offices (along with a friend) over fifty times, writing the name of each service representative down so that we didn't dupe up on anyone and raise any red flags. (It was a huge registrar, though not GoDaddy.)<p>We were able to use the public info available on their whois records to weasel our way into getting additional account information from the employees. We'd simply call and ask for a small piece of the account information in a nonchalant manner, they'd ask for info we've already obtained from previous calls, and usually they'd either give us the info or say ""we don't have access to that information"".<p>The hardest part was getting the last four digits of the credit card on the account. Since we had all the rest of the user's information, we called maybe twenty times trying to get those numbers. Some employees would say they can't see them, but they could. All it took was one really stupid representative:<p>""Yes, I'd like to confirm the credit card on my account before I file a form to retrieve my account back. I have two cards that end with the same last two digits, what are the first two digits of the last four digits""<p>[she doesn't understand so we confuse the hell out of her for minutes on end]<p>""uh... 2... 6.""<p>""And the last two?""<p>""82""<p>""Thank you, I have the right card. Good day.""<p>Had a good laugh, filed a form, emailed it in, stole their domain before they noticed, and never gave it back. I talked to the owner and eventually redirected his website back, and he forgave me.<p>Keep your whois info private if you're on a crappy registrar. Likely, the OP uses the same password everywhere and some random kid stumbled on his godaddy account and took the domain from under his nose.",1322873504

I constantly run into the limits of my working memory; problems too complex to grasp.<p>If I immerse myself in the problem for a while (e.g. 3 days), it often becomes clear. I think that some aspects transfer into long-term memory, until what remains fits into short-term memory. Another deeper effect is when I see a new way of looking at the problem that makes it simpler; a way to divide it into parts, or layers, or aspects that <i>can</i> be dealt with independently.<p>It's frustrating to have limited working memory, but I console myself with the fundamental truth that <i>everyone</i> has limited working memory. A far more important ability is being able to handle problems that exceed one's working memory - with a few steps, you easily exceed the working memory of anyone.
Another benefit is that this division into parts/layers/aspects is a <i>theory</i> of the problem, which can be transfered to others. By finding a simpler, better way to think about this problem, you can save everyone time and effort (including super-geniuses, because it frees up their working memory). Even wrap it up in a product and sell it, which saves even more. And even if a super-genius could effortlessly grasp it in working memory, he/she would have no interest in finding a simplifying theory of something already trivial, would feel no value in it if they did see it, and couldn't believe there's be any value in bringing a ""solution to a non-problem"" to others. It takes someone like me. And of course, the <i>real</i> super-geniuses end up working at <i>their</i> limits, same as me.<p>Of course, it would always be nice to have just a little bit more working memory.

They idea of not being able to share books, to not ""own"" what I had paid for, etc. really bothered me. Last year, someone bought be a Kindle for Christmas, so I figured I may as well give it a try. The Kindle quickly became one of my most cherished possessions.<p>Some observations:<p>1) Yes, the DRM sucks, philosophically speaking. I would even pay a little more just to get DRM-free versions, but unfortunately that's not an option (yet?).<p>2) Over time, you save money on books. A dollar here, two dollars there; it quickly adds up. Pretty soon, even if you ever had some book removed from your Kindle, you would have saved more than enough money to just go buy the physical copy.<p>3) That said, the horror stories about books getting removed (like the ironic '1984' fiasco from a few years ago) or accounts being locked are extremely rare. Out of millions or tens of millions of Kindle owners, there are only a handful of stories about people being screwed by DRM.<p>4) Because of the convenient form factor, the ease of taking the Kindle everywhere I go, and the ease of buying books (a double-edged sword), I read 2x as much as I used to. In 2010, I read just under 40 books; for 2011, I'm on track for about 70. For me, this alone makes the Kindle worth it, regardless of DRM.<p>5) You can have several Kindles under one Amazon account. This means my wife and I can buy 1 book and read it at the same time on our individual Kindles. That's pretty sweet.<p>6) As others in this thread have mentioned, you don't have to buy books through Amazon. That lets you potentially sidestep the DRM issue depending on the availability of what you like to read.<p>So yes, in theory, DRM sucks, and I would happily pay higher prices to truly own everything that I purchase. In practice, the cons of DRM are outweighed by everything else.",1322871656

The ads are pretty great! As the blog post says, they are unobtrusive and only displayed when the Kindle is off. More importantly, though, they are sometimes useful. The first few ads that I ended up clicking on were ""$5 off any Amazon purchase"" and ""Buy any one of these 100 bestselling business eBooks for $1."" Yes, there are ads that have nothing to do with Amazon or books, but the fact that I occasionally see an ad that makes me go ""Wow, I will use this!"" is pretty unexpected and pleasant.

It was also a matter of people having way more disposable income and leisure time than ever before, as well as the means of production becoming readily available to the masses.<p>You're also mostly talking about an era during which the marginal cost of distribution was significantly greater than zero. That's not the case anymore.<p>""our worry should be ensuring that artists and the creative industries have economically viable roles""<p>I disagree with this. I think most of our enduring works of art come from a time before copyright. Some, e.g. works of oral tradition like Homer, the Ramayana, the Bible, Gilgamesh, etc. actually depend on the unrestricted free exchange of ideas.<p>We just passed through a historical window in which the confluence of surplus disposable income and leisure and scarce distribution models made a few artists very rich (but a few corporations even richer).

The intelligence which lets me write code at a level well beyond most of the population is not the same kind of intelligence that would make me succeed in business.

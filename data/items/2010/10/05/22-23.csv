If the core group of accident-causing people drive fast/drunk/etc regardless of the rules, then lowering limits/changing rules must have limited effect.<p>Underlying all this is the government love of speeding taxes.  The only problem is, the marginal return on speeding tax decreases as the tax take goes up.  Because people decide to obey the limit, the tax take starts to go down.  Thus the conundrum for governments - do they set the fines at a level where people are annoyed but don't mind, or do they increase the fines to the point where revenue steeply drops.",1286319097

A big part of the reason for this is its userland.  The truth of the matter is that BSD tools are often much more consistent and less overly complex, and have better thought out basic functionality and interfaces, than GNU tools.<p>BSD Unix systems also resist the influence of the GNU project where many Linux distributions do not.  For instance, in some distributions you will find far too many pieces of software that have nothing for man pages except a reference to how the real information is in a GNU Info page.  The GNU project very much as a ""not invented here"" problem, where it not only wants to replace everything in the world -- even when it's ""free software"" -- with something weird and less usable that bears the GNU stamp on it.  Meanwhile, the various BSD Unix systems insist on standardized tools and documentation that is easy to use, like man pages instead of Info pages.<p>Speaking of documentation, that's another good reason to use FreeBSD (or OpenBSD, for that matter).  The big BSD Unix systems are among the best-documented OSes I have ever seen, and I have seen quite a few operating systems.

1761762,comment,1761609,1761609,0,0,mjfern,,,"Sorry for the self promotion, but I wrote a blog post that is related to this discussion about passion for work. The post is a reflection on my own thought process, as I transitioned from academia to starting my own company (and creating a custom career that I would be passionate about). For convenience, here is some relevant text from my post:<p>""The way that we choose careers is strange. We often choose a career based on opportunism (e.g., expected salary) or fear (e.g., what family may think). The result is that we end up in a place that’s not fully satisfying. That we pick careers in a haphazard manner is stunning given the fact that we spend nearly 100,000 hours working over our lifetimes.<p>So if opportunism or fear are not the best ways to choose a career, then what’s a better approach? I believe three main factors should drive a choice of career. The first factor is goals. What are your short-, medium- and long-term goals in life? And it’s very important to think about goals beyond just your career. The second factor is pleasure. What activities do you derive real enjoyment from? The third and final factor is skill or expertise. Where do your innate and learned skills and talents lie?<p>Consider a Venn diagram comprised of these three factors — goals, pleasures, and skills — and a fulfilling career likely resides at the center.<p>Finding a career at the center of this Venn diagram is simple in theory, but difficult in practice. The first challenge is to overcome inertia, moving beyond opportunism or fear as your selection criteria. The second challenge is managing and balancing other commitments in your life, such as financial or family obligations. The third challenge is to know yourself deeply. It’s surprising how few people take the time to truly understand their goals, pleasures, and skills. The fourth challenge is to identify a career that aligns to these three factors. Many careers will satisfy one factor, some two, but few will satisfy all three. For some people there may be no established career path that aligns to all three factors, which means you have to create a “custom” career.<p>How does one learn about their goals, pleasures, and skills, and a matching career? Through a process of contemplation, trial and error, and growth. You must contemplate and be deliberate in your actions, but allow your perspective to evolve over time, as you attain more experience in work and life. You must try a lot of different things to learn about yourself and how you respond to different activities and settings. As you hone your understanding of yourself, you must undertake deliberate practice within a specific domain for an extended period to advance your expertise and skill. Imagine starting your working life at the top of a funnel, and as you contemplate, experiment, and grow, you move down the funnel, and towards a better understanding of yourself and an ideal career.""<p>(<a href=""http://www.fernstrategy.com/2010/09/18/choosing-your-career/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fernstrategy.com/2010/09/18/choosing-your-career/</a>)",1286317007

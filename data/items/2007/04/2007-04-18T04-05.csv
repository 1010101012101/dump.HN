Good to see some critical thinking and conflict over one of PG's essays -- much more interesting than just a biographical interview or unnecessary flattery.<p>My favorite part:<p>""If you want to date a painting -- like in the sense of to identify its origin, not to have a relationship with it...""<p>Thanks for the clarification there... ;-)",1176871881
13966,comment,13608,13608,0,0,rms,,,"I made the interview! My team was one of the ""We're doing X  but easy to use"" people. We didn't have a functioning demo but we did have graphical mockups of the design. I thought we nailed it, but apparently Paul didn't get it because we didn't have an animated demo. I've been kicking around an essay for a while about just how trivial easy-to-use design can be, it'll be on here eventually.",1176871677
13965,comment,13608,13609,0,0,akkartik,,,"I disagree. It is true that:<p>1. Video is a slow way to process information in the internet era.<p>2. Weinberger doesn't come off well. The frequent interruptions at the start are irritating. What starts out seeming like a talk turns into a debate between two people, and the change in format is jarring for a bit. And it is hard to understand what Weinberger is getting at. This might have to do with our disparate vocabularies, and the wide disparity in the worlds he and I live in.<p>In spite of these, W does have a point. It is non-trivial to separate the fashionable from the timeless in a thing of beauty. 'Space aliens' may require a human-like visual cortex to appreciate the Mona Lisa. Does that make it just a narrow fad as well, or is a visual cortex a protocol prerequisite to evaluating it? As I asked PG over email, where does fashion end and convention begin?<p>A lot of the ancient philosophical arguments are between polar opposites like these. Should we find out about the world with reason or the senses? Is mind or matter supreme? Is it ok to abort foetuses or not? We know that one can exaggerate anything to make a point, and yet it is easy to fall into the trap of ending up with an extreme viewpoint because one can't decide where to draw the line. Eventually we (will) figure out for each of these issues that there can be richer answers than the obvious black-or-white.<p>So beauty can be timeless, but also tightly bound to a context. It is not clear that all of the latter is bad. How to separate the two? Open question. Relativism is no worse than believing passionately in the wrong anwer.<p>---<p>So much for the academic debate; PG's outlook is more utilitarian[1]. The problem of building beautiful things is a hard one, and it makes more sense for a builder to 'flow timeless' rather than to follow fashions. The alternative may work too, but there's less percentage in it. This is perfectly reasonable, it's just not the same question W is grappling with. Both of them are right, they're just asking slightly different questions. They don't ever figure this out in the video, IMO.<p>BTW, I believe this conversation contributed to a PG essay:

Make them want you, make them think that they are about to lose because everyone else recognizes how valuable you are. Make them <i>think</i> that they could not go on without you.<p>More importantly though, working like a dog for years just to impress your for your employer!?! This is not the startup way.",1176871504

The first thing I asked him was ""are you spying for Google"", and he hemmed and hawed actually.  He gave no indication at all that he was interested in doing a startup himself, but wanted to figure out what we were doing.",1176870929

That compiler became a full fledged dBase dialect that even spawned an active third party tools market.  Not to bad for a first project.

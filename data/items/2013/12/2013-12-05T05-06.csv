I used to work in the medical laboratory business before getting into software development. I do not think 23 and me is going to escape enforcement from the FDA. The comments they made to NYT were about the fact that the FDA has to look at each test individually to determine if it can be CLIA waived. They imply that this is an archaic way of doing things as they are testing millions of correlations, and compare it with the challenges in the tech community with slow regulatory change.<p>They are wrong about this. The FDA does have to evaluate every diagnosis that they are making as it is that.. a diagnosis.  Diagnoses that are going straight to the consumer have an even higher bar to meet not unlike a drug becoming OTC.  Medical laboratories are not allowed to perform direct to patient testing for non waived tests.<p>The purpose of this is that they do not want patients to interpret tests incorrectly where there is gray area, and possibly make adverse decisions based on the diagnosis.<p><a href=\"http://wwwn.cdc.gov/CLIA/Resources/WaivedTests/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wwwn.cdc.gov/CLIA/Resources/WaivedTests/default.aspx</a>",1386223169

There have been few, if any, documented cases of HIV transmission to medical professional from patients that did not involve sharps incidents.  My wife, and several close friends, worked for multiple years among people living with HIV/AIDS in W.

There is much about programming languages and functional programming that one might read interspersed with these books. Other than following references in the backs of many of these books, the Haskell wiki is a good place for starting to dig into literature on functional programming, as many articles link to important and interesting papers.<p>On that note it&#x27;s a bit strange not to see a few books on semantics, such as Transitions and Trees or Semantics Engineering with PLT Redex, listed among books like TAPL and Barendregt&#x27;s Lambda Calculus. Especially now that DSL design is something many programmers are dabbling in, it makes sense to gain some background on operational semantics.

Regular escrow puts the funds under the full control of the escrow provider, where he _could_ do something else with the money, regardless of the buyer and seller wishes.

We could and should add some form of max() for comparator functions, which we already have for sorting.<p>P.S. By the way, there <i>are</i> examples of functions where type classes are nice, for example sum(), where the type class lets you correctly express the sum of zero elements. (But max() is not one of these functions.) So in fact, we would definitely like to experiment with type classes in a future version of Ceylon, especially since the idea probably meshes very nicely with our reified generics.<p>> What am I missing?<p>You&#x27;re missing that the definition of compose() is abstracted over the arity of the second argument function in Ceylon. It&#x27;s _one_ function, not a different method defined for each Fi type. Which means that I can write similarly-abstracted functions that use compose().<p>> Is there also stuff for filtering elements by type, mapping, grouping?<p>Sure. Tuple is a subtype of List, which is a subtype of Iterable, which defines all stream-processing functions. FTR, an [Integer,String,Float] is a List<Integer|String|Float>.",1386221402

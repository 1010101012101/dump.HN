For example, starting teaching with quantum computer science might be really beneficial because qubits bypass some of the difficulties (differential equations, waves vs particles, tunneling) while keeping most of the weird (superposition, entanglement, measurement, interference, counterfactuals).",1406638789

Ironically, it&#x27;s probably most like the thing free markets were &quot;designed&quot; to fix than anything else - things called &quot;royal patents&quot;.<p>What this works out to in reality, divested of all the religious narrative, is that free markets are better than what were called &quot;royal patents&quot;. This goes directly back to Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; and SFAIK, nobody&#x27;s really improved on it.<p>&quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; was an expansion on economics from his &quot;Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot;.<p>I would submit that a reasonable comparison between the U.K. and the U.S. is vanishingly close to impossible. Especially with the NHS; that was formed after the War when the country was in pretty poor shape. People had trouble getting 1500 calories a day. In the US around the same time, we ensconced employer based insurance. That was fine so long as large, monolithic corporations ruled.<p>The people you are probably decrying the most are those who hold that the Efficient Markets Hypothesis ( see, it&#x27;s not even a <i>theory</i> yet ) always holds no matter what. We dunno. Modulo the EMH, free markets generally perform better. The only debate is whether or not health care is a public good. SFAIK, <i>that</i> is unsettled, too.",1406638571

There&#x27;s room for improvement. Scala-refactoring is a great example of community contribution.<p>Scala style checking is on our roadmap for 2.12. I&#x27;m procrastinating reviewing the first PR for the tool (abide) right now.<p>Finally, I would like to clarify we are doing everything we can think of to encourage the community to help shape the design and implementation of Scala. We publish roadmaps, review (and even rework) community PRs, do most of our team comms publicly (we are a distributed team), solicit proposals for language changes (e.g., <a href=""http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/pending/42.type.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/pending/42.type.html</a>). We spun out library modules that are now being maintained by the community. I spent last year simplifying the core build, so that we can move to a standard sbt build this year, which should also make it easier to contribute. As a first step towards updating the [spec](<a href=""http://scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/</a>), we converted it to [markdown](<a href=""https://github.com/scala/scala/tree/2.11.x/spec"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/scala/scala/tree/2.11.x/spec</a>).<p>That said, I think it&#x27;s only natural that the Scala committers on Typesafe&#x27;s payroll are more inclined to work on customer support issues / internal Typesafe support. We always try to strike a fair balance to give back to the community.<p>Please let me know how we can do better, here or via contact info in my about.",1406638360

8101920,comment,8101216,8101852,2,0,kaoD,,,"> For all intents and purposes, E-Mail (assuming you are in control of your own domain name) and Bitcoin are equally decentralized.<p>I completely disagree.<p>If your system isn&#x27;t fully peer-to-peer, it&#x27;s not decentralized. Period.<p>The central servers might federate with each other, but it&#x27;s still not decentralized since you&#x27;re still relying on central third parties.<p>Even if you set up your own server, the recipient&#x27;s server is still a third party you have to rely on.<p>> Bitcoin uses DNS seeds to bootstrap new peers.<p>You focus too much on DNS (which I purposely skimmed over in your parent comment, just a single sentence) while I&#x27;m talking about the system itself.<p>In the first place, Bitcoin relies on DNS much less than email: it&#x27;s easier to replace DNS for Bitcoin (e.g. using list of known seeds, as you said) and it&#x27;s something you do once (when connecting to the network for the first time), while email relies entirely on DNS for normal operation.<p>- If you want to send email to a new unknown domain, you must fetch it&#x27;s mail server from DNS if you don&#x27;t know its IP already. And you still have to rely on the destination server proper operation!<p>- If you want to send some BTC to a new Bitcoin address, you&#x27;re good to go as long as you&#x27;re already connected to the network.<p>Let&#x27;s level it: even if you avoid using DNSs both on email and Bitcoin, Bitcoin is still way more decentralized (since it&#x27;s peer-to-peer) compared to email (which is peer-to-server-to-server-to-peer).<p>If there&#x27;s a server inbetween, it&#x27;s not decentralized.<p>Also: Bitcoin addresses are not tied to single providers, while email addresses are.<p>> Bitcoin miners may choose not to include messages in the block chain.<p>But because it is a decentralized protocol, someone else may choose to include it. That&#x27;s the magic! If a single peer refuses to do something, there are still thousands of peers which might not refuse! In email, you rely on two authoritative servers, the sender and the recipient. If any of those two fail, communication is interrupted.<p>Even you can include the transaction (with enough horsepower) or offer some compelling reason for others to include it, such as a huge fee.<p>In email, if the server you rely on refuses to do something (think of a judicial order)... you can&#x27;t do anything about it other than changing providers, updating your addresses, sharing your address with your recipient (which you might not be able to), etc.<p>> Once the destination host is known, E-Mail can transport messages directly through SMTP. Bitcoin can broadcast to any nodes, including the desired recipient.<p>Exactly! Quoting you: <i>Bitcoin can broadcast to any nodes!</i> Even if the recipient isn&#x27;t even connected, the system keeps working!<p>That&#x27;s what makes Bitcoin more decentralized than email.<p>I&#x27;ll quote you again: <i>Bitcoin can broadcast to any nodes!</i><p>> And it avoids the problem of having to rely on unreliable peers and picky miners.<p>So you&#x27;d rather rely on <i>a few</i> unreliable and picky servers which might be subject to coercion, instead of <i>a lot</i> of unreliable and picky peers which are easily repleaceable without damage or any burden to the system or its users?<p>The key here is <i>a few</i> vs. <i>a lot</i>, and replaceability of nodes without burden for the users.",1406638063

There were certainly a few quirks, but it was nothing compared to web development in &quot;the old days&quot;.  Without any library the whole DnD song and dance is implemented as part of a React component that&#x27;s only about 100 lines of JavaScript.<p>There are two places likely to trip you up.  One of them is as mentioned in the original article: it&#x27;s hard to remember which events need to have their default prevented.  At the moment we&#x27;re calling `preventDefault` in `onDragOver` which is required to identify the element as a drop target, and `stopPropagation` in `onDrop` which I believe is to prevent many browsers&#x27; default attempts to navigate to a dropped url-like thing.<p>The other potential pitfall is that, for security reasons, the data can only be read in `onDrop`, not in `onDragOver`.  If you have a string id you don&#x27;t mind being downcased you can just use the hack of sending that through the data transfer types (eg. as type &quot;id/12345&quot;), with a &quot;text/plain&quot; fallback.",1406637421

KPIs reveal patterns, force you attention towards certain issues and create a base for discussion. They can also pidgeon whole you into misunderstanding what is happening though.<p>In my experience, KPIs work better as a tool for communication and as input for analysis rather than for optimization of goals. In a previous job I worked with aggregating the Balanced Scorecard for a 10,000 employee corporation. On such an aggregate level where the KPIs are composites of many underlying decisions there is less of a risk of perverse incentives.

8101835,comment,8101717,8101742,1,0,jvickers,,,"I&#x27;ve done some drag and drop programming, but not using the HTML5 API. I may have read that article quite a few years ago, but another problem was that HTML5 was not considered ready for use all those years ago. Recently (well, within the past year or so) I have found clients&#x27; requirements have been far less strict in terms of supporting older browsers, so I have been making use of more HTML5 features. I still have not used HTML5 drag-and-drop.<p>The basics of drag-and-drop only take a few lines to implement, but it&#x27;s important to do extensive testing to find the edge cases. I found (one year ago) there were problems with jQuery UI that stopped me from making full use of it. I wound up using it for the basic dragging - it would reliably tell me mouse move events, clicks, buttons, and the mouse position, but because the droppables system would miss some events I implemented the logic surrounding detecting where the item was being dragged. Basically, whenever the item got moved, a whole bunch of calculations would run to see what object it&#x27;s positioned over or near, and it&#x27;s position within whatever object it&#x27;s over.<p>If you want to do drag-and-drop programming in the browser, I recommend you write some code that allows you to pick up a DIV and drop it elsewhere on the screen. It&#x27;s not trivial to do the first time, but once you understand the patterns it becomes so much easier. The techniques are useful for other similar things, like creating resize handles.",1406636704

Its onset each evening is called the dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO).<p>It is principally blue light, around 460 to 480 nm, that suppresses melatonin, proportional to the light intensity and length of exposure. Until recent history, humans in temperate climates were exposed to few hours of (blue) daylight in the winter; their fires gave predominantly yellow light. The incandescent light bulb widely used in the twentieth century produced relatively little blue light. Wearing glasses that block blue light in the hours before bedtime may decrease melatonin loss. Kayumov et al. showed that light containing only wavelengths greater than 530 nm does not suppress melatonin in bright-light conditions. Use of blue-blocking goggles the last hours before bedtime has also been advised for people who need to adjust to an earlier bedtime, as melatonin promotes sleepiness.<p>When used several hours before sleep according to the phase response curve for melatonin in humans, small amounts (0.3 mg) of melatonin shift the circadian clock earlier, thus promoting earlier sleep onset and morning awakening.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin#Light_dependence"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin#Light_dependence</a>",1406636259

No. Breaching copyright is not a crime, except in a few circumstances (which vary from place to place, but often include e.g. commercial exploitation). It&#x27;s generally a civil wrong.<p>And it&#x27;s probably not even a civil wrong. The acts restricted by copyright are limited and enumerated. E.g. you generally need a copyright licence to perform a work in public, to communicate it to the public, to lend it to the public, and of course to copy it (among others).

The priority at that time was ensuring higher availability and providing multiple data centers with worldwide loadbalancing.<p>On our first CDN provider, they could not perform SSL certificate validation and thus were themselves susceptible to a MITM attack. So the decision at that point was to run SSL off of the origin server. We wanted to make it essentially free but wanted to ensure that the bandwidth was available for those that cared to use it, hence the small donation.<p>The situation is different today with our new CDN, they can validate the certificates all the way through and that&#x27;s how we intend to deploy it.<p>We won&#x27;t be able to enable full https redirections for all traffic since this would cause havok in organizations that are firewall locked and for tools that don&#x27;t follow redirects.

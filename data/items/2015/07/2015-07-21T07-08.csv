Usually naming stuff is pretty easy for me but...well, it is hard to make a snail simulation sound interesting and cool (because it&#x27;s not). But I sure as hell was going to try!<p>One of my big rules was that I didn&#x27;t want it to sound too _gamey_. This is a _simulation_, not a _game_. I also wanted it to sound kind of unique. The other thing is...the .com. You wouldn&#x27;t think .com domain names related to snails would be very popular, but all the <i>snail</i>.com stuff I tried had already been snagged! My list of brainstormed names included, but was not limited to, the following:<p>* Snails<p>* Snail Simulator (sounded too gamey because of all the other <i>simulator games, but I registered the domain just in case)<p></i> SnailWorld.com (unavailable)<p>* SnailTales (too gamey and cutesy sounding)<p>* TheSnails<p>In the end I settled on...wait for it...Gastropoda.<p>It sounded unusual and the use of the name of the snails&#x27; taxonomic class kind of promoted the simulation over the game aspect. Ignore the fact that slugs should then also fall into this...and are not included in the simulation. But as for the .com - even gastropoda.com was already taken!! I ended up registering gastropodasim.com and learning to live with it.<p>But it never quite felt right. I kind of resigned myself to not being 100% happy with the name - I just needed _a_ name. And then...I learned of the .life TLD. Screw the long _gastropodasim.com_! I saw that snail.life was available!<p>And, urged by the sheer appropriateness of this name and domain name to the thing I am actually making, I learned to drop the .com and renamed the project to SnailLife.<p>In the end availability of domains and some hard rules on the message I wanted to get across (unique, not too gamey-sounding) was what drove the naming of my simulation for me.",1437465213

Same here. On my daily dev system (Debian), frequent updates were sporadically breaking different bits of system -- sound would stop working, then would work again but something else would glitch -- and eventually I got busy enough that I just couldn&#x27;t sink the time into troubleshooting things if the next round of updates happened to break anything I really relied on.<p>Time passed.<p>I now have something like 2,000+ updates to apply via apt and I am terrified. I have this sinking feeling that if I try to update now, my laptop will grow legs in the middle of the update and try to run out into the street to put itself out of its misery.<p>I think -- I hope! -- we&#x27;re very close to completely reversible software updates in Linux environments. Between containers and VM snapshots and ZFS and efforts like Nexenta (<a href=""http://www.osnews.com/story/19180/Transactional_Debian_Upgrades_with_ZFS_on_Nexenta"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.osnews.com/story/19180/Transactional_Debian_Upgra...</a> -- amusingly, the link to the page on nexenta.com is no longer available and I can&#x27;t find a newer version of it on their site), I&#x27;m hoping that updates will become a little less of a time sink in the future.",1437464934

A lot of the time, making a custom type be a monad simplifies the logic - that is, you&#x27;d want to implement the monad operations (and support do notation) anyway. Calling them by their standard names makes it easier for other people to read your code, and being able to use generic library functions like traverse (which work for any monad) with your custom type is just a bonus.",1437464729

8794059,comment,8793733,8793915,0,0,zzzeek,,,"> Now the problem is that Lenovo is trying to be more like Apple and this does not go well with them. You can ask how much people are pleased with the new single button touchpads or how they like 16:9 screens instead of 16:10 screens or how they like the lack of Delete button.<p>I have one of those newer lenovos, and if the trackpad is their attempt to &quot;be more like&quot; Apple, they really have a very long way to go in terms of copying functionality.  For one thing, Apple correctly understands that we humans have our thumbs (which, lenovo, is the part that most comfortably moves <i>independently</i> of the rest of our hand) on the <i>inside</i> of our hands, so perhaps that&#x27;s why the buttons are supposed to be on the <i>bottom</i> and not the top, where pretty much any scroll + click activity requires two hands with the lenovo.  It&#x27;s a UX disaster.",1419447534

Below that price, all sorts of noticeable compromises are made; from screen resolution to overall build quality.<p>[0]I do a <i>lot</i> of procurement in my current job and spec for spec, Macbook Pros actually sit in the middle of the market place based on cost and I argue that they are placed higher in terms of build quality than most other brands too. Extensibility is where they fall down massively, but then after 3 year, all our machines are retired anyway, by which time they are financially written off.

Sadly, hardly anyone making core business software actually does.

It&#x27;s just not that important when you have email and text messages.<p>Same thing with factory work. Yeah, you still need people.. but you need less people.

You see this all the time: a manager will hire someone to do something that they just don&#x27;t like to do themselves. A convenience hire, basically. As long as the budget is there, everyone feels good.<p>For instance: &quot;project managers&quot; (Different places call them different things). I&#x27;d define this role as people that don&#x27;t actually have any hiring or firing authority, or significant design role, but rather, they&#x27;re mostly in charge of client relationships. Useful? Sure. But mostly that role exists so that the people doing the actual work have a buffer between them and the client/customer. If the economy fell of a cliff again, we&#x27;d probably not have that many project managers.<p>I just think different economic systems make sense in different contexts. Capitalism was a pretty good idea when growth was the most important factor, but now the US Government literally sets extra wheat on fire to keep prices at a certain level.

It&#x27;s true that a camera will capture the image during a certain interval of time instead of a definite point in time (obviously) but the length of that exposition time is not necessarily connected to the framerate.<p>For instance if you have a digital camera where you can select the framerate (pretty common these days) and if the exposition time was simply the frame period, it would mean that the image at 30fps would be exposed twice as long as 60fps and the resulting picture would look very differently.<p>Of course you can mitigate that by changing the aperture and other parameters but in my experience in practice you can select the exposition time and framerate independently on digital cameras. With very sensitive sensor and/or good lighting you can achieve very small exposition times, much smaller than the frame period. If you&#x27;re filming something that moves and unless you want to be blurry on purpose you probably want to reduce the exposition time as much as possible in order to have a clean image, just like in the video games.",1419446723

If I&#x27;m remembering correctly, this was the first high profile corporate OSS dump (years before Java, for example) and shortly thereafter was largely considered a failure since Netscape became irrelevant and the Mozilla project didn&#x27;t stop the MS juggernaut. Therefore it would be a number of years before a company was willing to take a risk like that again.<p>Of course with hindsight we can see that the Mozilla folks played the long game. Quietly working in the background they produced a product (Firefox) that actually did largely kill IE dominance. You can argue the role that Chrome had in this, but my opinion is that Firefox created the market for non-IE browsers.

What it&#x27;s saying is that when you render a frame in a game, say the frame at t=1.0 in a game running at 60 FPS, what you&#x27;re doing is capturing and displaying the visual state of the world at a discrete point in time (i.e. t=1.0). Doing the analogous operation with an analogous physical video camera means you are capturing and compositing the &quot;set of images&quot; between t=1.0 and t=1.016667, because the physical camera doesn&#x27;t capture a discrete point in time, but rather opens its shutter for 1/60th of a second (0.16667 seconds) and captures for that entire interval. This is why physical cameras have motion blur, but virtual cameras do not (without additional processing, anyway).<p>This is obvious to anyone with knowledge of 3D graphics or real-world cameras, but it was a cool little revelation for me.

For example: throw away your TV. This will significantly reduce your exposure to advertising. Similarly, subscribe to a good music service: you&#x27;ll avoid the ads and your taste will drift away from the mainstream toward whatever you genuinely enjoy. Avoid the news. There&#x27;s so much news that someone else will know whatever&#x27;s going on and you&#x27;re ignorance will give them an opportunity to tell you.

This situation mimics the micro-movements of the eye during fixation and shows that these movements could enhance the performance of the cells&quot;[1]<p>So if I understand right, since the biological systems are tuned to extract extra detail via supersampling across time, and a small amount of noise/grain can enhance that ability (mimicking natural movement of the eye), it actually helps our visual system extract more <i>real</i> detail.<p>It seems counterintuitive to add noise for more detail, but the explanation is fascinating.<p>[1] Stochastic resonance in visual cortical neurons: does the eye-tremor actually improve visual acuity? – Hennig, Kerscher, Funke, Wörgötter; Neurocomputing Vol 44-46, June 2002, p.115-120",1419444707

Media began heavily speculating it was tied to The Interview about 1-2 days after the hack was initially reported, but the hackers waited until Dec. 15 before explicitly mentioning it. If they wanted to take advantage of the sensationalism, why continue releasing messages and threats that clearly acknowledge Sony and the media between Nov. 24 and Dec. 15 while not mentioning The Interview until the most likely motive essentially became obvious?<p>Second, I think the group name &quot;Guardians of Peace&quot; is a fairly obvious allusion to &quot;guarding international peace by preventing Sony from releasing The Interview&quot;, and is in line with just about everything they&#x27;ve been saying. And of course they were using that group name on day 1.<p>I&#x27;m not saying North Korea necessarily did it, but I think the actors either intended to stop the movie from the beginning, or intentionally framed North Korea by using a pretext of trying to stop the movie. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re a group of hacktivists who only appropriated The Interview as a motive after media speculation.",1419444668

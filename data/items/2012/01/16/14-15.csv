But for all the people who express sentiments like yours and all the people who read it and all the people priding themselves on being the smartest people in the room, somehow stupidity still slips by under our noses. How? And, just as a hypothetical, you can find a comment much like yours then look back through that person's history and see they're a chronic fluff contributor. How is it that we know not to do something, speak out against it, and then do it anyway?<p>Also, I don't like your proposed solution. It assumes the worst in people. I tend to believe that if you cater to the lowest common denominator then that's what you get but when you assume the best in people they'll try to live up to that expectation.

If you look at the comments in the thread in question, there's really only one person who's behavior is lamentable, and it's clear by his continuous statements in the topic that he isn't even aware of it...DunningKruger is spot on. I was even so pissed I took the bait and fed the troll when I probably should have thought better of it.<p>However, looking back at the thread a day later, I see that the community policing <i>worked</i>. That vast majority of the really despicable comments were downvoted into negative territory. The poster's statements were tossed out into the trash they were.<p>The truth is, we shouldn't extrapolate the behavior of one attention starved malcontent to the entire community. I'm personally <i>impressed</i> with the community. To me at least, the community worked hard to keep the discussion appropriate and positive, elbowing out the bad sort of folks who shouldn't be participating in a forum like this.<p>Yeah sure, there were a few other questionable top level posts, but nothing entirely inappropriate, most of the ugliness centered around one person (I'm including myself regrettably as a participant in responding to this troll). So it's no the community that necessarily behaved badly, in fact the community behaved quite well.<p><i>edit</i> Something I thought I'd add after reading through a few more comments discussing how the quality of discussion here appears to be going down. I have to disagree. I'd say that the comments and discussions here are extremely strong, better than they were about a year ago (or whenever pg turned off comment voting). At that time, HN seemed to be suffering from an outrageous echo chamber where a select group of superstars were automatically the top comment in every thread they participated in, the cult of Apple was going through all kinds of absurd egocentric narcissism, a Haskell and a Daring Fireball post was guaranteed to be on the front page, and any comments pointing this out were mercilessly downvoted and their users flagged - and comments supporting the echo chamber group think were guaranteed karma earners.<p>Since the simple switch to turn off comment points, this trend seems to have dissipated. Superstars no longer squat at the top of the mountain, Haskell no longer dominates the front page, we still love Apple, but only as a product company that makes cool stuff, not as a cult, and dissenting opinions and reasonable debate seems to have returned. The front page is dominated by tech tips and business ideas most days, even in the shadow of SOPA. In short HN has returned with a vengeance.",1326725570

It had almost no furnishing at the time. The only things I had to buy were an airbed and basic cooking supplies (pot, pan, nominal silverware) and I was able to live basically the same way again.<p>(Of course it helped that I was living in a place with great public transportation and lots of things to do. I also long ago replaced my books/music/movies/etc with digital versions, so I didn't have to carry anything but a hard drive for those.)<p>For what it's worth, I did not have the benefit of a large bank balance like the OP presumably did (I was fortunately debt-free, but had almost no money saved away). To maintain this lifestyle, I had no choice but to live frugally (thankfully, I never get tired of cheap home-cooked pasta).<p>It's not for everyone, but I like living this way.

3470783,comment,3469863,3469863,1,0,leslyn,,,"I think one of the most difficult aspects of being a founder is attempting to find balance with your life. There is a fine line between driving passion for an idea and 'living' life. Entroyneur's comment here is valuable hindsight - I think many of us put ourselves 'over the edge' because we are so passionate about our projects. I suspect that you have expectations of yourselves and one another that have yet to be discussed. My recommendation would be to sit down and develop a clear understanding of what you 'expect' from him, what you feel you can/are contributing and define how that looks.<p>I would also encourage you to communicate more with him. Conversations that begin with ""I am really frustrated because..."" will help you vent your anger constructively without pointing a finger. It may be that you didn't communicate exactly what your expectations were. ""I need to know that you are willing to ...."" is a good way to let him know what you expect.<p>Try to define what his needs are and how much time he is willing to dedicate - does it match yours? Put it on paper so that it is visual. Develop a contract of sorts that you both are accountable for.<p>In the meantime - step back and take a long deep breath. You are not going to 'change' him. Perhaps he has a better understanding of balance than you do at the moment. Understand that this is a trap that many of us fall into when we get excited and passionate. Patience is one of the most difficult lessons that I ..continue.. to learn being a founder.",1326725371

It's not possible to mandate the usage of keyword attributes in Python 2, this function could be called with<p><pre><code>    do_send_mail(""some@email.com"", ""another@email.com"", ""Hello!"", ""hi!"")\n</code></pre>\nJS/Ruby's low-fi version of using hashes actually helps there as you have to provide hash arguments via the hash.<p>Python 3 lets you fix this issue (a great reason to switch, by the way) by using a [0] argument (not a -arg, which you can use in Python 2 but which will simply make your stuff fall into a black hole unless the creator of the function asserts no positional argument was passed via e.g. `assert not arg`; furthermore Python 2 would require that a default value  to check for  be given for each keyword argument):<p><pre><code>    >>> def foo(*, a, b):\n    ...     print(a, b)\n    ... \n    >>> foo()\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n      File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>\n    TypeError: foo() needs keyword-only argument a\n    >>> foo(1, 2)\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n      File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>\n    TypeError: foo() takes exactly 0 positional arguments     (2 given)\n    >>> foo(a=1, b=2)\n    1 2\n</code></pre>\n2. the arguments are separate from the method name in Python, in your example the method is `do_send_mail`, in Smalltalk and Objective-C it's `doSendMailToRecipient:cc:subject:body:` which has advantages and inconvenients. Python is easier for default values (you need a new method in Smalltalk or Obj-C), but the Smalltalk/Obj-C method is simpler for behavioral differences (as the dispatch is done at callsite, Python will need internal soup)<p>3. There is no order in Python's argument (whereas changing the order in Smalltalk/Obj-C changes the method called), which means callers can lower the call's readability by swapping arguments around in... less than sensible ways.<p>(nb: I love Python, don't interpret my comment as a put down of it, just pointing out fundamental and important difference between Python's keyword arguments and Smalltalk's keyword <i>messages</i>)<p>[0] I hate HN's markup.",1326724450

In 1972, an estimated 642,000 people signed ASL at home, and about 375,000 of those were deaf. It's somewhat likely that the number of signers has gone down since then, due to the decrease in rubella (a significant cause of childhood deafness), the oral deaf and cochlear implant movements, et cetera. It's unlikely that the number of signers has increased. So assuming there are still around 375,000 deaf/HoH signers in the country, that's 375,000 out of 35 million people with hearing loss, or just about 1%.

Tab-complete requires that you pause for a short time to read your options while you flip through them. Steno is entirely deterministic; you can implement the command in one stroke without twisting your hands around (unlike metacommands, especially those used in emacs, which can result in the dreaded emacs claw), and you know exactly what the result is going to be. Because you're writing entire words with each stroke, if you accidentally hit the wrong key, you'll be able to reverse the error in a single ""delete last stroke"" command, rather than having to backspace 20 times to correct a letter transposition error you made several words ago. Qwerty requires commands and variables to be broken down into minuscule portions, with the potential for error occurring each time a key is deployed. Steno reduces that error potential drastically by chunking words and variables into single-stroke entities, requiring less vigilance for error and allowing for a much smoother flow of thought and composition.",1326723385

337140,comment,336526,336734,0,0,wallflower,,,"I don't know much about football (and my friends corroborate), and you may be surprised to learn that the forward pass itself was actually an innovation that was introduced into American football over 100 years ago. Before the forward pass, teams simply brute-forced the ball forward.<p>“John Heisman, a noted historian, wrote 30 years later that, indeed, the Tar Heels had given birth to the forward pass against the Bulldogs (UGA). It was conceived to break a scoreless deadlock and give UNC a 6-0 win. The Carolinians were in a punting situation and a Georgia rush seemed destined to block the ball. The punter, with an impromptu dash to his right, tossed the ball and it was caught by George Stephens, who ran 70 yards for a touchdown.<p>Heisman wrote he was at the game standing near the action on the sidelines. He is emphatic that Pop Warner, who was coaching Georgia, protested to the referee to no avail. And he adds that he personally wrote Walter Camp, the final authority on football, of the possibilities of the ‘forward pass’ making football a new and more exciting game.”<p><a href=""http://tarheelmania.wordpress.com/2007/09/13/unc-invented-the-forward-pass/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tarheelmania.wordpress.com/2007/09/13/unc-invented-th...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_pass"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_pass</a>",1224432818
337139,comment,336698,336796,0,0,time_management,,,"Any location can become desirable. As the population rises, so does the supply of desirable places to live. Chicago and San Francisco weren't even on the map two centuries ago. Within the U.S., differences in levels of ""excitement"" and cultural amenity between cities are narrowing due to modern technology, to the point where the decision of whether to live in New York, Chicago, Seattle, or Minneapolis has more to do with personal tastes and situations than with one city being more desirable.<p>As for existing houses becoming more central, I tend to disagree that this is inevitable. Many suburban and exurban houses are going to be abandoned as oil becomes scarce. Many towns and locations have died instead of developing. We tend to assume that existing houses will age well, but this is driven by survivor bias as we forget about those that are abandoned and die.<p>As for the long-term influence of population trends, if the population continues to grow, it will be too large for the planet's resources long before we run out of physical space.",1224432800

We've been coding furiously throughout the past few weeks, to flesh out in a demo what we thought would be the key differiantiators of our idea.

We have no business model, just trying to make our own lives easier. (tmedweb.tulane.edu). We went from bluehost to our own server on the university's network, and we stayed with CentOS along the way. The box is a spare dual-core dell desktop (highest load I've seen was about (0.30 0.14 0.10)), we have a 10 Mbps card and 100Mbps card (our current bottleneck), a little 500 GB RAID from G-Tech (total used ~ 8.4 GB, but if we take on lecture audio or video, this will get eaten fast), UPS (enough to drive in if needed), etc. We end up working a lot with the university's very helpful netsec guy for ports, bandwidth throttles, that sort of thing. We get about 500-600 visits a day.<p>I'm also getting ready for a different project, to take on the military's medical records system, which could get huge fast. So the tmedweb project is also a bit of a sandbox for what to do for that bigger project.<p>Gigabit ethernet is probably next on the todo list; what else should we be getting ready for? In what order to people generally arrive at which scaling issues? From where we're at now to ""big"". Not Google big, but, let's say, Navy big.",1224432131

Our food production and transportation are highly dependent upon oil, and we don't have enough domestic oil to sustain the system in place.<p><i>non-existent property structure: nobody owns anything, so nobody has the incentive to maintain things or use things to turn profit, etc (doesn't appear to be a huge problem in u.s.)</i><p>I agree that we don't have this problem in the US. Our housing infrastructure is decaying because of poor, unsustainable design (sprawl) and because people lack the time and money to maintain it, not because they lack incentive.<p><i>no preexisting contracts, markets, distribution channels, etc; almost no preexisting social network of business relationships, since all operations were run by the state (not a problem in u.s.)</i><p>The ""preexisting social network"" of people who actually run American society is small, exclusive, and unambiguously an enemy. These people won't be relevant in an economic collapse, but I can't see them doing anything to help out average people. They'll fly off in their private jets. As for the suburbanized hoipolloi, they're already culturally and emotionally alienated, and they'll be physically dispersed once gas is expensive/unreliable.<p><i>the main issue: it was 3rd or 4th generation of people raised in the world where ""business"", ""profit"", ""property"", etc were all synonyms for ""crime"". ""doing something people want/need"" was unthinkable. the only people who dared to think about it were criminals [and that's how we got the country we have now] (and no, i can't imagine that being a problem in u.s.)</i><p>This is one crucial difference, and the US will be served well by the difference in attitude. Although the corporate elite are rightly viewed as a parasitic, criminal class, people harbor positive views of small business, and are largely comfortable with markets, capitalism, and profit. This might enable us to recover well.",1224432026

I am by no means anti-flash; I know the SWF and FLV specs like the back of my hand. I have annotated wireshark logs of RTP that are almost faithful to the ""spec"". And most importantly, I am an Adobe fan, and sided with them against Apple.<p>But this is one of those ""top idea in your head"" things. Now, after seeing those demos, my mental model of ""what flash can do"" has been diminished. I will still use flash for microphone capture, sockets, and persistent cookies. But I know now that I don't need flash for audio, video, and interactive eye candy.<p>Flash has always been a last resort, and seeing HTML5, in this light, is like discovering Qafiya in English:<p><a href=""http://www.ghazalpage.net/prose/notes/arabic_rhymes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ghazalpage.net/prose/notes/arabic_rhymes.html</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qaafiyaa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qaafiyaa</a>",1282459876

1624330,comment,1624027,1624224,0,0,ekiru,,,"Hi. I'm the author of the post.<p>> The Perl 6 article is about all of the syntax that you need to understand before you can read the equivalent piece of code.<p>I think it's more that the Clojure article just shows the code with very little explanation. Whereas my post was intended to demonstrate some of the basic capabilities of Perl 6's multiple dispatch and type system for people who aren't very, if at all, familiar with Perl 6. People unfamiliar with Clojure can probably guess what the code in the Clojure post does. I think I was able to (although I've dabbled in Clojure and Common Lisp, so I can't speak from the viewpoint of a total newbie to those languages). Some of the Perl 6 syntax I devoted paragraphs to explain were probably as clear as (defrecord Person [name age]), but I chose to explain them exactly to be sure that any readers unfamiliar with Perl 6 were able to know the exact semantics(e.g., that readonly attributes are the default). Some of the syntax is not something someone who has never heard of Perl 6 will be able to look at and know the meaning of immediately. Is that really such a problem, if the meaning of such features(sans bugs in the implementations) can be explained and fully understood in a couple of paragraphs and make things much more convenient for the person who does know the language? You learn them in a day or two and benefit from them for the entire time you use the language.<p>In addition: the two pieces of code are not equivalent. The Perl 6 functions validate the types of their arguments. The age-group function can tell you the age-group of both a Person and an age. As well, if you want to write another multi dispatching on the age group of a Person, it's easier with the Perl 6, because you just have to do ""multi can-have-kids-meal (Child $kid) { True }"" and ""multi can-have-kids-meal ($person) { False }"".<p>> But, I wonder, what does ""generally"" mean?\nIt means that you should read the rest of the paragraph to see some examples of its uses. Don't worry, though, the actual spec (<a href=""http://perlcabal.org/syn/S02.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perlcabal.org/syn/S02.html</a>, grep for ""The * character"") is much more detailed. My explanation was a bit lackluster, I suppose, but I was trying to not devote much time to it, since the post is about multiple dispatch and the type system, not about the philosophy of DWIM as expressed in the simplicity and usefulness of Whatever.<p>> Oh. It means that sometimes -- even in the context of a trivial nine-line example -- the damned asterisk will mysteriously fail and will force me to bang my head against the keyboard for half an hour until I finally figure out that I just can't use it. \nWell, more like five minutes (from time that I noticed the problem until the time that I had figured out the cause of the bug in Rakudo). But, yes, there are still bugs in Rakudo. I doubt this particular one will be around much longer(although it'll probably still be in this month's Rakudo *, since the compiler release was Thursday).",1282459517

Just as an entrepreneur can create a business plan and analyze the market, a blogger can do the same. Except with a blogger, it's much easier; if your blog only gets a few hundred visits a day, you know you're in the $10/year range without having to turn on ads or pay the licensing fee.<p><i>Not exempting low-revenue blogs from the $300 fee is also absurd.</i><p>I agree.",1282458797

You would have the same municipal overhead whether someone runs a blog or not.<p>It's not reasonable to tax anything that can potentially bring in money as a business. Do I have to get such a license to sell something on eBay or run a garage sale? What if I sell something on craigslist? It would make more sense to charge for any of these because they have more impact on municipal services than just running a blog because I at least have to transport the goods. A blog just requires a visit to a web page.<p>This is obviously a move of desperation on a group that Philly still believes can be marginalized without disruptive public outcry.

If they're lucky.<p>Seriously, though, this article had a lot of random details strewn about, but not enough thread to connect them. Can cites and states declare bankruptcy? Yes. No. Well kinda, but it doesn't help. Are structural issues like union contracts for future payments in terms of benefits a problem? Yes, but not really: the author just makes a passing reference to ""political will"" as being a problem, whatever that means.<p>All I got from the article was the unsaid conclusion that governments can simply not pay their debts without defaulting.

These concepts are <i>all</i> descriptions of fundamental relationships between people and other people, and between people and their physical environment.<p>The idea that social conventions exist for the benefit of society is something of a tautology.  Obviously, anything that anyone creates or does is something they're doing because they've judged that it will be of benefit to them.  The ideas of 'law' and 'government' follow the same rule - these are also just conventions that people established, in the expectation that they will somehow benefit.<p>But the real question, the empirical question, is this: what are the actual motivations that have led people to establish these conventions?  I suspect that the idea of law emerged <i>after</i> the idea of property, as people sought to maintain the relationships they established with physical objects in the context of their relationships with other human beings, and sought a structured and formal way to do so without violence (or perhaps merely dissension and group harmony, given that cooperation is as essential to our nature as competition).<p>Fast-forwarding to today, with all of that in mind, I think it's reasonable to make a distinction between the conventions that arose from a 'natural' social context and those conventions which are the product of positive law, the latter being a kind of 'secondary' experimental thing, intentionally designed by the mechanisms of the earlier first-order convention.<p>In my mind, 'theft' is a violation of the first kind of convention, while 'copyright infringement' is a violation of the latter.",1299174382

So where's that political will?<p>And if cities and states start declaring bankruptcy it will impact the country in two important ways:<p>1.  All the state workers will see their pensions evaporate to the bare minimum which will cause them to cut their spending to the bare minimum.<p>2.  All the 401(k) plans that are filled with supposedly safe muni bonds are going to see their investments evaporate which will cause the holders of those 401(k) plans to cut their spending to the bare minimum.<p>My argument is the net effect of this is all those people are essentially unemployed as far as the economy's concerned.  Because unemployed people are provided the bare minimum by the state so a person who is working but living on a bare minimum budget has the same economic impact.<p>Suddenly you have a society that consists of people who don't have money and people who have money but put it all in savings which does next to nothing to spur the economy.<p>Meaning the nation is going to be faced with a scenario that mimics an unemployment rate of 60% or more and I can't imagine what will happen then.",1299173905

Help them solve part of their problem in a small way, prove you're an expert and then when you launch you can let them know that you can solve a much bigger portion of their problem\n--Segment your list. Find out who's opening up & clicking through your emails and who isn't. Send the people who are opening & clicking more email. Send those who aren't less. There's a lot of talk about sending too often or not sending enough, but that's a bunch of crap. Fuel the fully interested customers with more content. Don't harass those customers who are partially interested with daily emails. Segment, segment, segment.\n--Make your news Newsworthy. When you do have something to say, make sure it's worth saying. Just sending something because you think it's newsworthy, doesn't mean it is. Make sure it's something you would actually want to know about the company. Your list's attention is precious. Don't abuse it.\n--Have a personality. Get someone to read the next word.

The internet has been mainstream (and I use the word loosely) for the last 10 years or so. Hell, I'm in my mid-20s and I remember using Internet when I was eight (hi Prodigy...haven't seen you around in a while!).<p>I was wondering if the internet has become so widespread that some regulation (but very little, since it is indeed very difficult to regulate). For example, last October, Congress passed the 21st Centry Video Accessibility Act, which among other things, requires pass-through captioning for videos on the internet (<a href=""http://www.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2010/db1207/DOC-303071A1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2010/db1207...</a>).<p>I'm undecided on the matter. More than any other industries, internet-based companies seem to respond to privacy and security concerns. Of course, the issue is that there are usually big screw-ups inspire such responses, such as leaking personal data by mistake.<p>Well, I do think some regulation is inevitable though - considering how important the internet is becoming. Once something becomes crucial to a segment of America's economy, the government wants to step in and protect people's interests (or at least what they perceive to be people's interests).

2284813,story,,,7,2,beeeph,"Show HN: My HN November App (Quotiac) is finished. Better late than never?",,"Back in October, the ""HN Make November Launch an App Month"" discussion was started and it sounded like a great opportunity, so I joined the Facebook group and decided to build my take on an iOS version of the classic Quotefalls puzzle game, thinking I would learn a ton and it would be a great way to get my feet wet with making, marketing, and managing my own software.  A week before the group presentation (end of Nov.), I took my project off the project list because I was nowhere near finished.  One of the many great things I’ve learned in all this is how easy it is to justify all the feature creep that bloated the design for my original MVP.  Every time I decided to include a new, major chunk of functionality in the first version of my app, I convinced myself that it had to be in there otherwise it would make the wrong first impression and people would never give it another try.  I still think that’s partially true, but only now that the first version is finished and in the wild am I’m realizing the incredible value of early feedback. It’s still early, but my early metrics show people aren’t really playing it and, if it turns that people don’t find the game as fun as I do (or at all), then sticking with the original, lean design for the MVP would have at least allowed me to recognize that early on and stop there rather than spend another three months tacking on all the single player and multiplayer functionality.<p>But I’m obviously still seeking feedback and I would love to hear what you all think, since HN is what got me started down this road.  Specifically, I’d like your feedback on the tutorial.  Does it explain how to play the game?  Is it a roadblock?  Are there any other aspects of the game that need to be explained better?  And most importantly, is the game any fun?  Brutal honestly is happily accepted!<p>The game is called Quotiac and it’s available for free on the App Store.  I even added a puzzle pack for the HN community, it’s called “The Hack Pack” and I think you’ll all enjoy puzzle #9 especially (http://quotiac.com/images/puzzle9.png).<p>Here’s a link to the app,\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quotiac/id400583719?mt=8<p>Thanks gang, I hope you like it.",1299172568

Also, it seems like their price point is a bit low and nearly unsustainable given the numbers in the article. If Artsicle buys an original piece for $1500 and rents it out for $50 a month, that piece needs to be actively circulated for 30 months before they see a profit on it. An unpopular piece may never become profitable, meaning Artsicle is stuck with upkeep and storage costs for an expensive mistake.<p>Let's contrast this with Netflix. Assume that Netflix pays an average of $15 for each DVD they hold (probably on the high end). Also, assume that each member pays an average of $12 a month for rental privileges, and that each member holds a DVD out for an average of 3 days. Each member's ""rental"" costs them $1.20 on average. This means that each DVD Netflix buys becomes profitable after 13 rentals, or just over a month. If a DVD never becomes popular enough to be profitable, Netflix is just on the hook for $15 plus negligible storage costs in case someone decides to rent it down the road.<p>tl; dr - What works for Netflix might not translate away from the DVD world.",1299172149

However we were proud of turning an idea into a site in 10 days and we really enjoyed doing it. We don't want to give up and we would love for people to use the site. The only way that will happen is if we can get the site and idea out there but in a completely unique way.<p>This is where you guys come in!

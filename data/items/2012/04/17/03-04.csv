I spent about 20 seconds on the website so sorry if you already have this, but I didn't notice it. The users could have the ability to do interactive jam sessions, even if they are miles apart. Maybe something like a high fidelity audio only version of Google Hangouts.Each participant would need some headphones and a resonable quality microphone. I guess if you were looking for a way to squeeze some money out of this, perhaps you could sell recorded copies of the jam sessions to the participans or anyone else willing to pay for them I guess.

3850978,comment,3850007,3850887,6,0,potatolicious,,,"> <i>""Being someone that was alive long before Facebook got big I can assure you this statement is wrong.""</i><p>Funny, you seem to know a lot about the experiences of myself and my friends - all of whom predate Facebook by a pretty wide margin.<p>This reminds me of the age-old and tired argument that Apple wasn't first to the smartphone game, as if that somehow robs their accomplishment of any weight. LJ never transcended being a niche online community, FriendFeed is a footnote, Friendster was well-known but not widely used... The only social network that had any real claim to popularity in your list is MySpace, and it was steamrolled by Facebook so quickly I'm sure their heads are still spinning.<p>Likewise, Nokia was first - but does it matter? ""Smartphone"" didn't enter the common vernacular until the iPhone. The fact that similar functionality (available with much poorer relative usability) existed prior to the game-changing product is supposed to prove... what? Remember ""No wireless. Less space than a Nomad. Lame.""? The execution of an idea is as important (no, <i>more</i> important) than the idea itself, and is worthy of recognition. Similarly, Henry Ford didn't invent the automobile, but he certainly was the one who brought it to the masses - and that is well worth recognition and respect.<p>So yeah, you're right, niche proto-social-networks existed prior to Facebook. So what? Facebook was the first mass-market social network that had any significant traction, and it remains the king of the hill. It has changed the way people interact, even if it wasn't the first to come up with the idea of it.<p>What's with the blithe dismissals of Facebook and Zuck-hate? This isn't a zero-sum game - there is plenty of space for Musk and Zuckerberg to both do their thing, and impact the things they will.",1334634474

3850908,comment,3847517,3847517,1,0,Lazare,,,"Of course they do.  Benford's Law is just an artifact of how counting works.<p>Let's say we are measuring widget production.  Right now we're making 1 widget per period.  Each period we increase production by 10%.  After a random number of periods, what do we expect the MSD (most significant or left-most digit) to be?  After a random (large) number of periods, if we add up how frequently different numbers show up as the MSD, what will the distribution be?<p>Well, let's think about it.  It takes 8 periods before our production number gets over two (and thus stops having an MSD of 1), and another 4 periods before our production number gets over three (and thus stops having an MSD of 2).  If we keep going, the results look like this:<p><pre><code>  1 -> 8 periods\n  2 -> 4 periods\n  3 -> 3 periods\n  4 -> 2 periods\n  5 -> 2 periods\n  6 -> 2 periods\n  7 -> 1 periods\n  8 -> 1 periods\n  9 -> 2 periods\n  1 -> 7 periods\n  2 -> 4 periods\n  3 -> 3 periods\n  4 -> 3 periods\n</code></pre>\nAnd so on.  If we were to stop there, we have counted 41 periods.  The most common MSD is 1 (taking place 36% of the time), followed by 2 (19%), 3 (14%), 4, and so on.  Benford's Law!  Of course, you might say, that just shows up because I chose to stop there.<p>But actually, it works to a greater or lesser extent, pretty much regardless of when we stop (or where we start).  It works regardless of the units being used.  It also works if we're adding a flat amount instead of a percentage increase, or if we're adding a random amount, or if the number is not monotonically increasing.  It also works in other bases.  (In fact, thinking about the example of binary may be illuminating.  The MSD is <i>always</i> 1 for any number > than 0.)<p>It also works if we're generating random samples between 1 and some BIG_NUM.  If you generate 1000 numbers between 1 and, say, 2^24, you might find that that the MSD of 48% of those samples is 1, while no other digit is found as the MSD in more than 7% of samples.  Pick a different BIG_NUM, and you'll see a different distibution.  2^20 gives you a much flatter distribution; in the test I just ran I saw 16% with a MSD of 1, versus 9-12% for all other digits.  But the point is, lots of potential BIG_NUMs produce samples which skew heavily towards having an MSD of 1, and thus a random BIG_NUM has a highly skewed expected distribution.<p>And so on. :)  It's actually kind of fun to play with.  But at the end of the day, this is just a product of using a positional number system.",1334633363

Figuring out how to keep it simple and non ugly, useful, sure. Keeping it cool early by only allowing Harvard kids, then other Ivy League kids, then other colleges, etc. But is that invention?

3850862,comment,3850007,3850625,36,0,mkn,,,"I find your comment amusing in light of my particular frustration with the near anonymity of SpaceX in relation to its accomplishments, especially in addition to the nearly universally unfavorable press it gets over at AviationWeek.com. And never mind that Orbital is not ""working on the same thing"" by any reasonable understanding of the phrase.<p>Let's get one thing out of the way up front: SpaceX launched, orbited, reentered, and retrieved a fully reusable capsule, one with an ablative heat shield that can be used hundreds, if not thousands, of times over. Disregarding the reusable aspects of the design, they're in the company of 3 nations. Include the reusability aspect and they're in the company only of the United States and the former Soviet Union. I have a degree in engineering. I have engineering friends, some of whom work in aerospace companies. Until this recent PR push, I hadn't found one of them who'd even heard of SpaceX, to say nothing of their groundbreaking and historical flight and recovery of a capsule with private funds. If that's ""all the press,"" then I have ""all the press,"" too. Go ahead. Ask me how it feels to be so famous!<p>The little press that they do get within the ossified aerospace industry has been terrible. AvWeek recently ran a piece which was focused on how SpaceX had ""lost some of its luster"" (not a direct quote, but close) with the slip from February to April for the Space Station rendezvous launch, as if any government-run space technology was ever delivered on time. A while ago, they found some blow-hard ""space policy expert"" to opine about how space was hard and how it was absolutely obvious that SpaceX was over-promising and destined to radically under-deliver. They ran another piece about how congress was unhappy with COTS. Only recently did they have to give some ground with a piece about how commercial space was ""already having benefits"" now that the launch is so near, and I was overjoyed with schadenfreude when they had to provide neutral coverage of the uninteresting and everyday fact that Space Station astronauts were rehearsing for SpaceX's visit to the station. There's a reason, I'm sure, that SpaceX chose Muse's <i>Uprising</i> as the theme song for their animation about their plans for full reusability. It fits.<p>Further, Orbital's offering is not even close. Orbital's vehicle is not reusable. It burns up on reentry, and therefore has no capacity to bring cargo back from ISS. And their price point is nowhere near Musk's. In case you're keeping track--and I mean the hypothetical ""you"", I'm not pissed at you, Metapony--that's less for more. Less than SpaceX for more money. Furthermore, the floor on Orbital's costs is the same trifecta that's always been around in aerospace: expendability, costs of disparate components, and integration costs. I'd love to see a viable competitor to SpaceX, but Orbital isn't even close.<p>Make no mistake, the battle is not between ""government"" vehicles and private industry. There are no ""government"" vehicles: Every vehicle gets built by private contractors. The battle is actually between the established aerospace industry, built around expendables and cost-plus contracting, and SpaceX, an innovative and disruptive aerospace company based around competition, reusables, and fixed-price contracts, with Orbital taking up the rear with the worst aspects of both models.<p>I know. I come across as a strident cheerleader. I hope that has less to do with any inherent fanboyism in my makeup than it does with my absolute perplexity at and frustration with the bare fact that SpaceX has done unprecedented, amazing, historic things, and hardly anyone knows about them at all.",1334632693

What I really have yet to see is AAA games put effort into making human behavior realistic (in real time, I mean, not in a cutscene). Like, would it kill ya to actually make the sound match up with the mouth once in a while?? This is 2012 and still there are only a handful of games that get even remotely close (Mass Effect, Battlefield 3 and then of course L.A. Noire and other mocapped games - I'm sure there are others, I don't play games but they're all the same to some extent). I think the thing about graphics game companies don't realize is, the better you make the graphics, the better you have to make everything around it to match -- character behavior, gameplay mechanics, etc. -- because the differences between the different parts of games are exaggerated -- you leave out some detail and the magic disappears. Games are just multi-faceted magic tricks, same for TV shows. The better you can hide the magic -- that's where the realism lies. Better graphics is just one part of the puzzle.",1334632097

A place to find gigs?<p>- See if there's a way you can help musicians find and take their next step.  This could have some sort of value, as nebulous as it sounds. Kind of like Mixergy.<p>- Group buy deals that you can target to your team.  You get to keep a cut of the deals.<p>- Adding musician tools that would be valuable.  I don't want to go all cdbaby, but maybe there's something there to help musicians learn about and manage the business side of their music.  I'm not sure if that means courses, a subscription, etc.<p>- If you can replace existing services musicians pay for, they will probably be open to paying you instead.  An example of this might be voicemail, or domain hosting (very basic and cookie cut with their own email address.",1334631944

8209014,comment,8206038,8208704,1,0,wes-exp,,,"Still ahead of mainstream programming languages, which are typically imperative by design, and usually overly &quot;noun&quot; focused compared to the &quot;verb&quot;-friendly nature of Lisp. Adding map/reduce/etc. to the noun languages is a bolt-on that is not exactly ideal.<p>Take Java 8 which now has map: sure, you can pass a lambda expression with a custom function body, but is using functions (particularly side-effect-free ones) as arguments idiomatic otherwise? I can only imagine the amount of ceremony code that ensues when trying to merge those worlds. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, having map/reduce/etc. is an improvement to Java for sure, but Lisp is still well ahead on the overall cohesion and utility of such things within the context of the rest of the language.",1408647587

Compile time is just the compiler&#x27;s run time, and we need access to the language at that time, and has to be type-safe also, and we would like that comile-time code to itself be compiled (and to have access to the language during that code&#x27;s compilation ...).",1408647541

It has taken me 10 mins just to figure out how to structure the require()&#x27;s so that it doesn&#x27;t error out, and that&#x27;s with only requiring two packages.<p>For example I created a quick index.js file and required angular and restangular. It immediately errored out because the angular.js repo doesn&#x27;t use semver on it&#x27;s master branch. Ok fine, switch to angular/bower-angular, nope, it looks for index.js so my require now has to read: require(&#x27;angular/bower-angular:angular.js&#x27;). Run again, error, same issue with restangular, it&#x27;s looking for index.js. That require now reads: require(&#x27;mgonto/restangular:dist/restangular.js&#x27;). I had to actually find where the files are that I wanted to require and explicitly state them in the require. Shouldn&#x27;t this automatically parse bower/component/package.json files for this info, especially if you&#x27;re touting the &#x27;No Manifest&#x27; thing.",1408647512

They are yet to appear in court where they face criminal charges, they are able to this by taking shelter behind sovereignty laws, the US govt has itself fully supported this. You seem to have conveniently forgotten to mention that, some axe to grind ?<p>I could add more, the Bhopal plant was supposed to be a replica of UCC&#x27;s MIC plant in West Virginia and UCC was in charge of design and construction. Strangely enough they thought the plant in India could do without most of the safety systems in place in the Virginia plant. Further, discovery process of litigation has brought forth gobs of documentation that shows that cost cutting measures were enforced by the US side of the corporation. Yes the ownership was indeed shared, but as is often the case control and power leaned overwhelmingly on the UCC side. Scientists employed by UCC wrote to Indian counterparts to help deal medically with the tragedy, in particular they mentioned people should be injected with thiocynate salts to chelate out the active poison. This in itself would have saved thousands of lives. However, since the success of this intervention would have proved that the leaked MIC is more than &quot;just tear gas, just wash your face&quot; they not only took a heavy handed approach to totally discredit the advice with FUD but instructed the Indian government to demolish stores of thiocynate that were being used by local clinics, which they did. They were aware of the long term affects of the leaked gas, but concealed all information about it, and knowledge of how the medical effects could be mitigated. They spread rumors about disgruntled employee precipitating the disaster on purpose, but to this day it remains just an allegation, no corroborating evidence of that has been found or substantiated. DOW, as well as the US government officials have several times pressured the Indian government to drop the charges in lieu of setting up a foundation provided that they are absolved of all liability.<p>If you care to know more there are enough resources on the internet and just a few google searches away, or else you can take a &#x27;post a driving ticket&#x27; smear approach to it.<p>The Indian govt had little to no real operational control over the plant but they are very far from fee of blame. They worked actively to shield UCC so as to make Indian economy look attractive to foreign investors. Warren Anderson was personally given a safe passage out rather then being detained/arrested. They suppressed, and continue to do so govt funded research on the health effects of the MIC gas conducted by its national medical lab ICMAR, purportedly because the findings are so damaging. They have taken no steps to corral the premises of the plant where children go to play habitually. However the moment there is a spike of interest in the national news the premises are heavily guarded to deny journalists and environmentalists access to the conditions.",1408647476

8209002,comment,8206124,8207355,1,0,briantakita,,,"I appreciate your coverage on type systems. One thing I want to point out is type systems are &quot;a way&quot; to model an information system. Type systems have become the dominant way in the past 30 or so years, but Type systems are not the only way.<p>For example, lets look at genetics. Genetics are based on the lineage of reproduction & mutations. The genetics of each organism in the lineage tree is essentially information. This information can be combined with another organism (sexual reproduction) to create a new organism. Also, an organism&#x27;s genetics change over the lifetime of the organism.<p>A Type system could model the lineage of each organism in the tree, however it does not seem beneficial to model it in such a way from an abstract point of view. There may be practical reasons to model genetic lineage with types, but I can&#x27;t think of any. My main reason is types ultimately reduce the resolution of the genetic information.<p>I feel like Type systems are akin to imposing a bureaucracy on individuals.",1408647409

8208962,comment,8208244,8208244,34,0,dperfect,,,"This is <i>not</i> the default behavior for a UIWebView. It relies on a practice that is very common among developers of iOS apps with web content.<p>Specifically: every click/interaction that loads content in your custom web view sends the webView:shouldStartLoadWithRequest:navigationType: message to your web view delegate. Without implementing that method, clicking a tel: link <i>will</i> prompt first. However, many apps throw some logic in there to detect any URI schemes that don&#x27;t match the standard HTTP/HTTPS schemes used in normal websites, and trying to do something &quot;nice&quot; for the user, they handle requests for those URIs by calling:<p>[[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:request.URL];<p>This is a reasonable thing to do (outside the context of tel: links) because it allows the app to spawn an external app for custom URIs.<p>Therein lies the problem: not that UIWebView opens tel: links without prompting (it doesn&#x27;t), but that many app developers are just trying to improve the inter-app experience, and unknowingly open tel: links directly with that openURL: method.<p>EDIT: Just my opinion, but I think it&#x27;s actually pretty cool that Apple gives developers the ability to dial phone numbers without an extra prompt. It makes third-party contact/phone apps much more useful (imagine having to confirm every phone number to dial after tapping the contact in the built-in phone app). In a way, this is the kind of trust / freedom that iOS developers rarely enjoy without a fight. It&#x27;s just unfortunate that in this instance, it also happens to be very easy to overlook this pitfall when implementing web view logic that handles non-http links.",1408646921

Fossil fuels and nukes are bad.  Soon the world will have nearly all energy on the grid, for cars, home HVAC, etc. from just wind and solar.<p>(8) Private cars are bad.  Trains are good.  If the US had any sense at all, then it would have 300+ MPH trains connecting all medium to large cities with really good service and really cheap tickets.  Otherwise we just need bicycles, and they are very, very good.  There need be only a few years of meager government subsidies to permit such trains, and then the trains would be economically self supporting just from the cheap ticket sales.<p>(9) Gluten is bad.  Sugar is much worse, is a poison and should be made illegal.  People should drink only pure rain water and pure grain alcohol.  Drinking anything else is giving in to a plot to pollute our precious bodily fluids.  We should not eat red meat because it is poison, and the animals are ruining the pure, pristine, precious, delicate, 100% natural environment.  We should not eat fish because fishing has nearly destroyed the oceans, and when the oceans have been destroyed humans will be destroyed.  Instead we should eat only organic fruits and vegetables bought in farmers markets directly from the growers.

8208936,comment,8206700,8208714,5,0,Amezarak,,,"> I also cannot help but see plot holes. For example, why does the emperor not take complete control of the spice production?<p>To expand on what the sibling poster said, the Emperor cannot take complete control of spice production - the Guild would never allow it. He has what he thinks is necessary and sufficient control. Remember that it was the Emperor who gave stewardship of the planet to the Atreides, in collaboration with his lackeys, the Harkonnens, and that the Emperor and his allies had amassed huge stockpiles of spice while planning to intentionally disrupt spice production and thereby make the Atreides unpopular.<p>He could not assume further control than he had for a variety of reasons. One reason is the ecology of Dune - remember that most of the Fremen were so adapted to the environment that neither the Harkonnens nor the Emperor apparently even realized most of them existed, because they considered huge swaths of the planet to be uninhabitable, and for good reason. Let alone the desert itself, remember the huge storms and the sandworms were pretty frequently destroying even massive industrial equipment and killing people daily. (The Fremen were also involved, but it seems that this was downplayed and often attributed to the environment.) The second reason is that the Guild has a very specific political agenda that  principally involved their access to spice and keeping the extent of their dependency on it a secret.<p>The Guild was totally aware the power that someone who controlled the spice would have - that&#x27;s why they went to great lengths to prevent anyone from gaining total control over spice production and export. As you see at the end of Dune, the Guild have a very limited political agenda, but in the end, they hold real power in the Dune universe. The Emperor and the Landsraad are helpless without the Guild, and the Guild knows it.<p>Additionally, remember that the Fremen were paying huge bribes to the Guild to keep certain secrets.<p>> The whole story is painted against a great backdrop of this struggle between the different houses, and the emperor.<p>The Landsraad is not exactly in conflict with the Emperor. The Landsraad is subordinate to the Emperor and part of his power structure in a way that say, the Guild or the Bene Gesserit are not. The Landsraad and the Emperor control CHOAM, the prime economic mover and shaker, together. What the Landsraad <i>would</i> fear, if it came to pass, is if the Emperor tried to consolidate his power by taking out the Houses one by one, which he does not try until <i>Dune</i> (in part because he fears the consolidation of the Landsraad power under the Atreides), and then only cautiously under the Harkonnen banner. The Landsraad are perfectly content to go along with the Emperor as long as they believe he&#x27;s not going after them.",1408646578

In Ember, most of the logic is in the javascript, templates merely serving the final result in a presentable way. In Angular I dislike to see the angular specific programming logic molded into HTML. In my opinion HTML is just a presentation layer. An example from angular:<p><li ng-repeat=&quot;phone in phones | filter:query | orderBy:orderProp&quot;> for me this is too much programming logic in html. Same goes for React.js too. Too much html + logic mixup, that requires two parsers to work in your head in parallel (html + javascript, and maybe even some css?). I find it messy.<p>None of it in ember. Logic is neatly separated. In ember I also really enjoy how you separate functionality on a single page into neatly defined controllers/routes/ and components.<p>Also the article says you add lots of <script> tags to your code.

8208807,comment,8205043,8206315,1,0,graycat,,,"I thought that the question was, why didn&#x27;t the universe collapse into one black hole right at the beginning?<p>With the argument I tried to outline, there was no black hole.  The reason is, in short, the <i>situation</i> was not like where black holes are formed since then.<p>The big difference is that, (1), now, the matter-energy for a black hole is in some region of space in our universe where that region is surrounded by the rest of the universe, and (2), then, the matter-energy filled the entire universe that there was, even if it was only the size of a baseball.  Then, that matter-energy filled the <i>whole thing</i>.  For that whole thing to have created some small black holes, the thing would have had to have partitioned into separate chunks.  But apparently what happened is that the space expanded explosively, really before anything could collapse.  Or, maybe the expansion was so fast that quarks, as close together as in protons now, soon were being separated faster than the speed of light and, thus, had no choice but to generate more quarks and, thus, more matter.  We&#x27;re talking really <i>explosively</i> rapid expansion.<p>Or maybe the gravitational field of some matter-energy wanted to propagate at the speed of light, reach out, and connect with more matter-energy, but before that gravitational field had moved even 1 mm, space had expanded so much that the other matter-energy to be reached had already move to a few light years away.  We&#x27;re talking <i>explosive</i>, so fast that speed of light is so slow as to be nearly standing still and irrelevant.  At least that is my intuitive understanding.",1408645412

In an unchecked language, the type can be something else (in BCPL, for example, it&#x27;s simply <i>word</i>; in the untyped lambda calculus, it&#x27;s <i>function</i>).  It&#x27;s important to note that, according to type theory, types are a <i>syntactic</i> feature, not a semantic one.<p>It&#x27;s just an observation rather than a judgment, and -- again from a type-theoretic perspective -- it&#x27;s true.

So you need to have a Unicode-aware locale for the functions in <locale> to do anything sensible with Unicode.  Of course, that&#x27;s something of a tautology, but I&#x27;m not sure what the standard requires for locales.  So, yes, if your implementation is Unicode aware, you can call a standard C++ function to get what you want, but be sure to call the right one.

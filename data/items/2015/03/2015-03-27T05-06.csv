Except, if clients maintain the tree, there must be some &quot;maintenance&quot; client, or each client must do some maintenance (find and fix things that go wrong).<p>My issue is, indeed, the cumulative failure rate; and I have enough experience with faulty hardware, especially memory, to know that important data needs reliable memory (e.g. ECC), and a &quot;client does maintenance&quot; model basically makes that impossible, unless you can mandate that all connecting clients have ECC memory - essentially, server class machines.<p>The problem with clients maintaining indices runs very deep: Uniqueness constraints are often implemented through index. If the index integrity is violated (easy to do - you have 1000 clients, anything that goes wrong in any of them - power surge, virus, ..., may corrupt the index), then it is possible for the entire database integrity to be violated.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are way to mitigate this, reducing the probability down to negligible (which is what ECC does - it reduces memory error probability to negligible, not to zero which is impossible); for example, you could have every client maintain their own index, not relying on any other client&#x27;s index but only on their immutable rows. That would still let a client violate database integrity, but any other client would immediately notice and refuse to work with the database.<p>However, I have so far not seen any reference to these issues by the ZeroDB guys.

But honestly, it&#x27;s just damn fun to play with, and especially for solving small logic puzzles.<p>For example, a friend and I were playing a board game where each player had hit points, which they represented with two types of cards: type A had &quot;5&quot; on one side and &quot;1&quot; on the other, and type B had a &quot;20&quot; on one side and a &quot;10&quot; on the other. You&#x27;d represent your current hitpoints by displaying some number of these cards (out of 6 of the first type and 3 of the second type) face up, and adding up the totals. So, I wanted to find out: what&#x27;s the smallest hit point value that I can&#x27;t represent with some combination of cards?

If you run this for different values of i (using push and pop if you&#x27;re clever; I just called Z3 100 times), you can get a &quot;sat&quot; or &quot;unsat&quot; which tells you whether a particular total is reachable.",1427432703

Aside from the big one (compiler enforced memory safety), some of the best Rust features are on their way into C++. For example:<p>- Traits: C++ concepts are on their way - there is even a working implementation in a gcc branch.<p>- Iterators: See Eric Niebler&#x27;s range proposal and accompanying range-v3 library.<p>- Monadic error types (including do-notation!) proposal: <a href=""http://www.hyc.io/boost/expected-proposal.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hyc.io/boost/expected-proposal.pdf</a><p>Other great stuff coming to C++ over the next few years:<p>- ASIO in the standard library - see prototype here: <a href=""https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/asio"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/asio</a><p>- Resumable functions<p>- Composable futures<p>- Parallel algorithms + concurrent containers<p>... much much more<p>2) Clang/Libc++ development is unbelievably rapid and it has greatly improved the tooling available to C++ developers.<p>Some highlights here:<p>- Clang-format and clang-tidy to help developers write cleaner code<p>- Sanitizers like AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer, ThreadSanitizer, UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer that instrument binaries to find bugs at runtime<p>- Much better error messages for template heavy code<p>- an API for easy development of custom tools that parse/consume C++ code<p>... much more",1427432543

When you&#x27;re ready to share it, just merge it into the development branch and push it. If you and your colleague are working on a topic together, you do the same, just push to some common remote branch for that topic.<p>> What happens when I type &quot;git push&quot;?<p>In Git 2.0, it pushes the current branch iff it tracks a remote upstream one; otherwise it prints an error explaining how to set the upstream branch for the current branch.<p>> So, is that before or after having been gc&#x27;d?<p>GCing only removes garbage. Since you&#x27;re creating branches to keep track of your topics, this shouldn&#x27;t ever be a problem. If you had no references to a commit, it must not have been important!<p>> Which branches did you get? etc.<p>As far as I know, cloning gets every branch from a remote; not all branches will automatically have tracking branches, but making those is easy enough.<p>> Worst, they are ways that you can corrupt your repository or blow your code away.<p>Do you mean making incompatible commits via rebasing by &quot;corruption,&quot; or are you referring to actual repository data loss due to bugs? I&#x27;m unaware of the latter. If you consistently make temporary private branches, it should be impossible to lose work.<p>Is graph theory really that complicated? I always thought it was one of the more intuitive compsci topics, since it&#x27;s very visual. Maybe that&#x27;s my bias, though.<p>I try Mercurial every once in a while, so I&#x27;m not basing my opinion only on old versions (in fact, I just played around with it again today.) I always feel constrained--like it&#x27;s trying to prevent me from doing what I want to do. A lot of it is familiarity, I&#x27;m sure, and differences in nomenclature (though, I&#x27;ll say, &quot;checkout&quot; makes a lot more sense than &quot;update&quot; to me--I would assume that &quot;update&quot; would be analogous to &quot;fetch&quot;).",1427432441

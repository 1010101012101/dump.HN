In your given example (daughter visits friend whose parent is high) you can punish cases if your underage daughter gets offered drugs, as currently would happen if she&#x27;d get offered alcohol or sex;  but saying that your neighbor should be imprisoned for what he&#x27;s doing in his own home simply because &quot;my daughter might visit...&quot; seems a bit ridiculous reason.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly okay for your neighbors (and parents of your daughters classmates) to do all kinds of wierd sh*t that you wouldn&#x27;t allow your underage daughter to do - they can practice crazy religions, have freaky sex including blood and bondage, do near-suicidal acts for thrills, implant horns in their foreheads, whatever.

6691579,comment,6690124,6690909,3,0,aestra,,,"Health insurance is weird in the US. In World War II we had wage controls which kept wages tight. When the War Labor Board declared that fringe benefits, such as sick leave and health insurance, did not count as wages for the purpose of wage controls, employers responded with significantly increased offers of fringe benefits, especially health care coverage, to attract workers. As a result it became the defacto standard to get your insurance through your employer and your employer picks a company and group plan that spreads the risks over everyone and pays most or all of the premiums with before tax dollars. Employees can usually pick from a few plans (individual or family, maybe two levels of coverage) For example, my employer pays 2/3rds of my premiums and I pay 1/3rd. They would rather give me health insurance than money for my own health insurance because they don&#x27;t have to pay taxes on the health insurance premiums they pay for me. Nobody gets a choice in what your employer picks as a health insurance. If I wanted my own insurance of my choice I would have to opt out my that extra money my employer kicks into my health insurance (I would lose it, I couldn&#x27;t apply it to my own plan, and it is a substantial amount of money)",1383850787

6691576,comment,6691312,6691534,1,0,kevingadd,,,"FP64 is more expensive on GPUs than FP32 (the cost gap depends on the particular architecture, but I&#x27;ve seen 1/8 and 1/4 ratios listed for recent parts) - so even if all modern desktop CPUs don&#x27;t pay an extra cost for FP64, it&#x27;s still worth thinking about the size of your floats for GPU compute.<p>Also, it&#x27;s important to keep in mind that even if the <i>cycle count</i> is the same, you&#x27;re using twice as much memory which means you&#x27;re occupying twice as much space in cache. If your buffers suddenly get twice as large to represent the same data, that&#x27;s going to negatively impact performance, just like how 64-bit pointers result in a perf penalty vs 32-bit pointers.

I went from Haskell to Clojure to JavaScript.<p>I loved Haskell <i></i>the language<i></i>.  What I don&#x27;t is third party libraries are usually directly or indirectly (through a dependency) tied to an OS.  I&#x27;ve heard, even on irc&#x27;s #haskell, that it&#x27;s hard to reuse code unless you&#x27;re on linux.  Coming from Java, this is a deal breaker for me.<p>Then I tried Clojure.  I liked it, but I found it very challenging to refactor and mentally debug my code.  I missed all the benefits of static typing.  core.typed seemed like an answer, but when you compare it to other languages it seems to triple the verbosity which is a real turn off.<p>JavaScript (via CoffeeScript) is a pretty good middle ground, but immutable state is nearly impossible.  If I get lazy, it&#x27;s so easy to go back to a OO/procedural style and I don&#x27;t like that.  That probably does have its benefits, but not when you&#x27;re trying to learn a new programming paradigm.<p>I know very little about Scala, but I get a terrible impression from it.  Where Clojure is about simplicity, Scala seems to be about complexity.<p>Since I learned Haskell, I wished there was a way I could use it and have it &quot;just work&quot; when I decide to use a library.

I get angry because the old way (vertical alignment on table cells) just works. As much as the CSS purists (some might call them &quot;anti-table zealots&quot;), it&#x27;s hard to argue with something that works all the way back to IE4 and probably beyond (well valign=&quot;middle&quot; probably does, CSS vertical-align: middle is probably IE5/6).<p>But beyond this there are so many things in HTML/CSS that should be simple but are hard. This is just one of them.<p>Consider spacing between table cells. There&#x27;s (still) actually no way to do this... if you want no spacing between the leftmost and rightmost cells and the edge of the table, which I find is a pretty good use case. People end up doing things like:<p><pre><code>    td { margin-right: 0.3em; }
    td:last { margin-right: 0; }
</code></pre>
Any such solutions had varying backwards compatibility issues, a problem we&#x27;re now largely getting behind us, but still...<p>Why can&#x27;t I specify (separately if need be) the vertical and horizontal spacing between cells separately to the edge of the table (which should really be a property of the table rather than the cells IMHO).<p>The problem here is that the CSS WG seems to have started with a model and then just run with it without running it through very common use cases.<p>Looking at the article, it looks fine. One thing I&#x27;ll say is it starts off with the &quot;margin: 0 auto&quot; trick, which everyone who does anything with CSS needs to know. Why is centering that hard? Why can&#x27;t I just say &quot;put this in the center&quot;? Why can&#x27;t I then use margins to offset from center or something?<p>Also FWIW, the margin: 0 auto thing didn&#x27;t work in older versions of IE if you didn&#x27;t specify a DOCTYPE and force &quot;standards compatibility mode&quot; (rather than the euphemistic &quot;backwards compatibility mode&quot;.",1383849994

Re: my example of the large media company I worked at:<p>In 2007, it was a very small minority of employees who could afford the $599 device and wanted extra support for it outside of BlackBerry Enterprise Server. By 2010, there were a lot of iPhones and the case could be made that it would meet the needs of a significant portion of the company while pushing device costs to the employee as a BYOD, thus saving money while still being able to enforce some security policies thanks to iOS 4. The head of IT wasn&#x27;t being a stodgy old fart (ok maybe a little) -- he/she made a rational policy decision that I think was correct at the time. Today I think they&#x27;re on Google Apps.<p>The problem I&#x27;m seeing now is that dozens of employees are sharing logins for the same SaaS tools.

At the same time we&#x27;re negotiating with our courier services to get discounts because of economics of scale. Right now, our discounts are not very high yet.

Nobody is getting &quot;ripped off&quot; as long as everyone is following the rules set down by the SEC.<p>Investors put money at risk. You know that because you&#x27;ve been here on HN a couple of years and no doubt read the <foo> is shutting down. stories. For each of those there is usually one or more investors who have put in thousands if not millions of dollars who get anywhere from $0 to some fraction of their investment back. Sometimes, their investment &#x27;bet&#x27; pays off and they get back multiple times their investment. The trick is you blend all of those $0 and multi-X returns and you get their &quot;effective&quot; return.<p>&quot;Joe Public&quot; and by that I assume you mean an unsophisticated retail investor (they aren&#x27;t investing anyone&#x27;s money but their own). Can achieve a similar result by buying &quot;shares&quot; in a fund managed by a banker. When folks ask me where I would put some extra savings I tell them I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the Vanguard funds.  You make more than then .8% return that a Bank savings account pays, and your risk is relatively moderate (but if it is not zero like it is with the savings account). But this unsophisticated person should <i>never</i> be investing in an IPO stock.<p>The professional managers who invest in an IPO stock may have hundreds of millions of dollars under management. They spread some of those over a number of IPOs as a way to provide &#x27;long kicks&#x27; (which is that the stock is held for a long time and the success provides a large return many years later). Clearly they aren&#x27;t putting their kids college fund in there. And most of the <i>other</i> dollars in their fund are on much &#x27;safer&#x27; sorts of things, like Coca Cola or Alcoa.<p>So this is the &#x27;cycle of life&#x27; for many new tech companies, and if these investors in Twitter do well their Venture Funds will have a reasonable rate of return, and more rich people will give them some of their &#x27;excess&#x27; funds to invest in other tech companies, and you and I can go get some of that by pitching them a great team and a great idea.<p>So for the 11 times smart people came to them and they gave them millions and got nothing back, this 12th time they got a lot back. Nobody gets hurt as long as the people who don&#x27;t know what they are doing stay out of the game. That didn&#x27;t happen in the late 90&#x27;s lets hope it doesn&#x27;t happen again.",1383849639

I think it was February 2013 when the results came out.<p>This does have a tendency to happen in various degrees in larger enterprise environments where configuration problems of the IDE and the systems you are building become costly to maintain.  The way we think about it is that organizations have invested in DevOps technologies to automate the entire release process post-commit of the code.  But that once the changes make their way out into complex staging / production environments, there are config + code changes that do not synchronize cleanly back into the developer&#x27;s workspace.   So, as the number of commits increases, and the size of the team increases, there are many more synchronizations that need to occur to keep development systems ready for the coders.<p>So the time suck shows up in mysterious ways:
1) Maintenance of the IDE install, especially with Eclipse which has had plug-in versioning & interoperability challenges at times.<p>2) Synchronizing configurations across teams, commits, and machines.<p>3) Collaborative / human costs, from the time spent in having large teams figure out the best way to operate & use their development workbenches consistently.<p>4) The environment problem, which is partly due to the production environment configuration is not exactly identical to what can be run on the desktop, so managing that in an automated way poses time issues.",1383849415

Every time I read another article about how somebody just maybe has figured out a kludgy way to vertically center things with CSS, I just shake my head.  Aren&#x27;t there any graphic designers on any of the W3C working groups surrounding CSS?  Back in the old days when everything was a table-based layout, there was a clean, one-to-one mapping between the grid framework that your graphic designer created and the code underlying the page.<p>Then the semantic web pedants came along and decreed that tables shall never be used for layout.  Fine -- but nobody ever bothered to come up with a DIVs+CSS replacement for the grid-based layout that any serious graphic designer uses to build a page.<p>And do you know what happened to the web?  Debate cause and effect all you want, but webpage designs are far more boring now than they were 10 years ago.  Now it&#x27;s all just blocks of large-print scrollable text, some images here and there (or maybe a wall of them), and a cute logo.  It&#x27;s like everything is a Geocities page with better fonts and color choices, minus the gifs.  I feel like I never see anything really cutting edge or creative in the design space on the web.<p>The internet is a really young medium of course, and it will naturally go through phases, where certain types of design come into fashion while others go out.  And I would love it if somebody would prove me wrong by posting some links to some really kick-ass-looking sites.  But from where I&#x27;m sitting these days, from a design perspective the web is a big yawnfest.

The outcome is obvious.<p>The Fed intentionally re-inflated assets, because it&#x27;s the only gimmick they have left. Once you lower interest rates to zero, there&#x27;s nowhere else to go but to intentionally try to spur asset inflation and generate a fake wealth effect, which the Fed has done two other times in the prior decades. They use their POMO program, along with mortgage purchases and cheap interest rates to inflate the stock market and the real estate market. It&#x27;s real simple.<p>There has been no job recovery. There has been no manufacturing boom. There has been no improvement in the welfare and poverty picture. There has been no improvement in incomes. And we&#x27;re still missing seven million full time jobs, and millions have fallen out of the labor force.<p>So why are asset prices booming? The answer to that is obvious as well.",1383849251
6691317,comment,6689421,6689421,6,0,blisterpeanuts,,,"My full time job in technology morphed into work-from-home after about eighteen months.  It happened for two reasons:  #1, they knew me and trusted me to get the work done, and #2, I was literally the last person on my team still on site.  My team&#x27;s spread all over the world at this point.<p>I kept going to the office for a while, then realized that, aside from having three monitors on my desk, there was no advantage for me going there, and there are disadvantages.  After two years, this is what I&#x27;ve learned.<p><i>Advantages of remote work:</i><p>- Time:  I save 2-3 hours daily from getting dressed up, making lunch, and commuting.<p>- Efficiency:  it&#x27;s quiet in my home office (the family knows to leave me alone while the door&#x27;s closed).  I&#x27;ve got 16 gigs of RAM on my home computer, plenty of disk space, and it&#x27;s actually faster and better than my work computer.  The work computer required so much bureaucratic rigmarole to get it updated that I gave up.<p>- Comfort:  my chair is always where I left it, unlike at the office :(.  My coffee is made the way I like it, unlike the crappy K-Cup thing at the office which never has decaf (I can&#x27;t drink full caffeine).  Lunch consists of pulling a piece of cold chicken out of the fridge 10 feet away.  I can walk outside into the conservation land across the street while thinking about a problem.<p>- Quiet:  I don&#x27;t have to listen to nonstop irrelevant conversation, computer noises, phones ringing.<p>- Financial:  We took a trip to Nova Scotia and I managed to work every day from my laptop in wifi hotspots, avoiding using any vacation hours.  Of course, it was not a vacation for me during the working day, but the family got to enjoy a nice trip.  I do the same when visiting the parents at Thanksgiving--we land Monday or Tuesday evening and I work before the holiday begins.  My vacation time has accordingly piled up and I&#x27;m going to cash some of it in.<p>- Family-friendly:  I can pick up and drop off my kid to school, and be at home for her while my wife&#x27;s at work.  No need to pay for after-school or a nanny.<p>- Healthy:  no stress from commuting.  I can go jogging at lunchtime, grab a shower later on in the day.  It&#x27;s just an hour out of my day, whereas there&#x27;s not even a shower at the office, let alone a gym.<p><i>Disadvantages:</i><p>- The fridge, as noted above, is only 10 feet away.  Even worse is the bowl of surplus Halloween candy sitting on the counter nearby.<p>- Always available means never offline.  My manager knows I&#x27;m probably at my computer at 9pm or 10pm, so he&#x27;ll text me with questions.  (I always answer.  To me, this is the price of WFH:  out of fear that some small minded executive will some day say, &quot;You should be in the office from now on so we can better track you&quot;, I make sure that they never have reason to doubt my productivity and availability.  I&#x27;m overcompensating of course, but then I enjoy my work and I am grateful for the flexibility so I return the favor.  We&#x27;re kind of a start-up within a big corporation anyway, so long hours are the norm.)<p>- The family sees me sitting there and talks to me.  I have to fend them off.<p>- Very tempting to spend time on Facebook and other sites such as Hacker News :)  I rationalize it as blowing off steam, but jogging&#x27;s better, really.",1383849239

6691311,comment,6690124,6690734,5,0,jeremyt,,,"Sure.<p>The health care system was structured poorly before any of this got started. Basically, how health insurance worked in the US is that about 90% of people get health insurance through their employer. This happened for two reasons: during the wage freezes around World War II, companies started offering fringe benefits to get around it, and there is a standard tax deduction for companies to offer health insurance. Individuals cannot claim this deduction.<p>For the remaining 10%, about half of them buy insurance on the open market, which is really cheap and easy for people that are young and healthy, expensive for older people, and pretty much impossible if you have an existing condition.<p>The remaining 5% go uninsured either by choice or because they can&#x27;t afford insurance at all. That doesn&#x27;t mean they can&#x27;t get health care, that just means they use free clinics and pay cash at places like urgent care centers.<p>The ACA made changes to the insurance market. Among the changes were new minimum requirements for what companies could sell as &quot;health insurance&quot;. For example, even if you are a single 25-year-old male, you now have to pay for maternity coverage, mental health coverage, childhood mental health care, and other things that you&#x27;re very unlikely to need. Further, health insurance is no longer allowed to have a cap on coverage, and companies are not allowed to charge old, sick people more than a small multiple of what they charge young and healthy people.<p>Mind you, a key campaign promise while passing the bill was that &quot;if you like your health insurance you can keep it&quot;.<p>After the bill was passed in rules were promulgated, it turns out that if health insurance companies make any change at all in a plan (even changing the deductible by five dollars), then they are no longer able to offer the old plan and have to switch to a plan that qualifies.<p>This rule is resulting in millions of people having their health insurance canceled, and they are being forced to go on to the (nonworking) exchanges to buy health insurance that in most cases is much more expensive (if you&#x27;re relatively healthy and young). New insurance results in you having to pick all new doctors, most likely, also.<p>So the main opposition comes from conservatives who oppose it on the grounds that government is interfering in the healthcare market, healthy people who are now being forced to pay sometimes more than twice as much, and young people who now get to subsidize the insurance of old people.<p>An additional philosophical objection comes from the individual mandate, which technically was upheld by the Supreme Court but many conservatives think that the Chief Justice had to contort himself into a pretzel to do it. Essentially, the ruling said that the government doesn&#x27;t have the power to force you to buy something but they do have the ability, under the taxing power to tax you for not buying something. This was not written into the law, and the Supreme Court had to, in effect, change a clause in the law to make this work.<p>There is a populist opposition to the law because there are many large companies and labor unions (and Congress itself, including the president) that have been exempted from the law... And there are rumors that the president is going to further exempt certain well-connected labor unions from the tax on high-cost health plans.<p>There are legal objections to the law because the president decided to postpone a tax on employers that was written into the law. Many legal conservatives don&#x27;t believe that the president has the power to rewrite portions of a law after it&#x27;s been passed by Congress.<p>There are religious objections the law because it requires private companies run by very religious people to offer abortion and contraception coverage in the health insurance they offer their employees.<p>And finally, because the Democrats and the President decided to pass this law without any Republican votes (And using a questionable tactic called reconciliation that enabled them to pass it with 50 votes instead of 60 in the Senate), there is no political downside to opposing the law on the Republican side. Mostly, Republicans dislike the law and therefore their representatives in Congress get more kudos as their objections to the law get louder and louder.<p>And there is no end in sight.",1383849210

It&#x27;s not. IE11 is a regression in comparison.<p>The browser quirks aren&#x27;t things like &quot;Oh, you need a vendor prefix here.&quot; They are things like, &quot;no matter what, keyframe animations will never work at all in the presence of the Facebook API, and transition animations will work sometimes (but not always!) because reasons, and sometimes (but not always!) animated elements will reset back to their original position after the animation completes.&quot;<p>Because of these browser-specific quirks, you&#x27;ll be spending a fair amount of time in the IE11 developer tools, which are very nearly unchanged since interns wrote them in IE7. Worse, they frequently crash and take the browser down with it. Or, they get out of sync with the browser, and &quot;Inspect Element&quot; stops working until you restart the browser. You&#x27;ll be restarting IE and staring at the &quot;Searching for solutions...&quot; dialog quite a bit.<p>When the tools DO work, you&#x27;ll find they&#x27;ve added a bunch of new stuff like the &quot;UI Responsiveness Wizard&quot;, but that&#x27;s a poor consolation prize for losing the great debugging features of other browsers, like &quot;Break on attribute modification&quot; and &quot;stabililty.&quot;<p>And, after spending days poring through JS, trying to find any sort of IE11-specific bug or behavior on these complex sites that work in very nearly every other browser, including IE10 and an array of mobile browsers going back to Android 2, you&#x27;ll find that adding random timeouts will start fixing some of these weird behaviors.<p>I&#x27;ve been mired in IE11 support for the past several months.

So the ideal max verification time should be about 60 minutes (6 blocks) on average, although you should see your transaction included in the next block mined (in 10 minutes-ish, assuming the miner included your transaction, which they have an incentive to do if you included a fee) but to stop a double spending attack, it would be unwise to consider a transaction verified after 1 block, 6 blocks makes sure your transaction is not lost in a blockchain fork or part of a double spending attack.

Correct.<p>It all depends on who is attempting the search.<p>City/County/State entities have their respective jurisdiction and all must comply with state law, and therefore some states no longer have reasonable grounds to search based purely on cannabis scent. It would be equivalent to police coming to your house and smelling alcohol on your breathe and attempting a search based purely on that.<p>Federal entities, such as DEA and Dept of Justice maintain federal jurisdiction and can come in and trump state law (by definition).

IPOs are fundraising events. Growth companies use money to invest in the business for growth, not profits (yet).<p>Second, it&#x27;s rare for early investors to cash out on the IPO (Facebook was an exception). Instead, they usually wait for a secondary or for the lockup expiration.<p>Third, yes, there is frequently an artificial &quot;pop&quot; on the day of the IPO because of the pent-up demand but that usually tempers quickly. Investors should definitely be careful and know what they are getting into. If they bought into Yelp, LinkedIn or even Facebook at the popped price and hung on as long term (read: every) investors should, they are doing fine.<p>Fourth, yeah, the investment banks get to dole out typically underpriced shares to their top clients.

Hundreds of millions in users and hundreds of millions in revenue is decidedly different than very few users and no revenue.<p>As for your numbers, there is no reason that a company needs to match their valuation with revenue each. That would likely be extremely undervalued. Apple had 170 billion revenue in the last 12 months and a market cap of 465 billion that many people think is undervalued. 63x is excessive, but 1x is silly.<p>>But what investors are interested in is not revenue 
That&#x27;s not always true. See AMZN<p>Profit is what I am interested in, and it is what a lot of people are interested though. Why are we comparing it to Apple, a hardware company with huge costs? It makes a lot more sense to compare to Facebook, which enjoys 50% margins. Also, why are we expecting it to have profits = to market cap? Really, 1x pe? Market average is ~15, with lots of companies being higher.<p>If, in 7 years Twitter has profit = to it&#x27;s current market cap, it is an absolute steal at this price. Like unfathomably good deal. I&#x27;m not convinced they will keep growing revenue at 100%, certainly not for 7 years, but I am convinced that they will become profitable due to their low cost structure.

I am in the fortunate position of writing an in house Django app, so basically it is in a constant beta state, and I have around 40 beta testers to tell me when things go wrong.<p>Now I see that unit testing would have caught a few of the bugs over the last couple of years  (but not that many of them) but in our case, adding new features and adjusting the data model to the constantly changing requirements is more important. My code does get tested, just not automatically.<p>I am not saying that it is a bad idea to unit test, and that I never intend to use it, but for the time being the time costs dont outweigh the benefits.<p>Also whenever I look at tutorials there is no advice on how to test the parts I want to test. Instead they demonstrate how to test 2 + 2 = 4. I don see the point in that when my application is mainly outputting a moderately complex SQL query results. I can generate a load of objects in the database, and set up unit tests, and have them run each time I update a completely unrelated part of the application, or I can use the real data, and check the results are as expected on my development machine.

Let&#x27;s continue that logic and apply it everywhere else in life:<p>The relationship between your neighbors and you is a matter solely between them and you. The government should not interfere. So, if for example your neighbor were to choose to rob your house, or murder a loved one, clearly, the government should not get involved.<p>When you&#x27;re driving, that&#x27;s a matter between you, your car, and perhaps the road. And your relationship with other drivers or pedestrians is solely up to you and them. You should all be able to do whatever you want and/or work out any disputes between each other as they come up. Laws would be pesky and just be government interference.<p>And by the way, as to your point about disrupting your insurance for reasons not relevant to your treatment. That&#x27;s a big <i>whoosh</i> that misses the point of the ACA. The whole core point of the ACA was in reaction to private insurance companies which would <i>deny</i> or <i>drop</i> people who were seriously sick. Thus, effectively denying <i>treatment</i>, or forcing them to rely on rush-to-emergency-room treatment, rather than cheaper and less stressful preventative care, or experience catastrophic costs, which then either bankrupt them and/or get passed on to all other taxpayers and customers, against those others parties wishes, anyway. Making sure more people get more and better treatment, more consistently, is the whole point of the ACA. It&#x27;s not perfect, nobody claims that.

The bank&#x27;s job consists of choosing a sensible price point for all parties involved and advertising the offering so as to generate interest in the shares. Once the actual IPO happens, the public is able to see whether or not the bank did a good job. This in turn is important for the bank&#x27;s reputation and ability to acquire future deals.<p>The FB IPO was widely considered a failure because the initial share price was unsustainable. The underwriters had to buy massive amounts of shares on the IPO day to stabilise the price above the initial level.

In this scenario, you take the difference in price, less the premium you paid the owner for the right to borrow. To give an example, say stock A is trading at $100, but you think it is going to fall. Say you find someone who is willing to let you borrow a share of stock A for a week for the premium of $1. You agree, and then immediately sell this share back to the market for $100. You now have $99. If the stock falls, as you hope it does, say to $90, you spend $90 to repurchase the share and return it. You now earned $9 on a short.<p>Consider the opposite scenario: you short, but the price goes up.  Again, borrowing a share of stock A for $1, trading at $100. You sell that share to the market and wait for the price to fall, so you can buy and return. But, suddenly the market learns that company A is insanely profitable in a previously unknown way, and the price of the stock skyrockets. At the end of the borrowing term, you are obligated to return a share of stock A to the person you borrowed from. How much will you have to pay to get it back? This is theoretically unlimited, depending on how high the market goes. If the market goes to $200, you have lost $101 on the short. If the market goes to $200,100 (and does not fall below this before the end of the borrowing term), you have lost $200,001 on the short.<p>Now imagine you have borrowed a LOT of shares on high leverage (value of what you borrow exceeds what you actually have on hand to pay it back) and you can see how shorting and being wrong can wipe you out.<p>Good point from svachalek[<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6690938"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6690938</a>] below: if the borrowed stock rises high enough, eventually the lender is going to margin call you..<p><a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortmarginrequirements.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortmarginrequir...</a>",1383847586

This is a complete nitpick but whatever.<p>More importantly, this shows a lack of understanding about the framework being used, not an issue with the framework. The example has a programmer basically assuming the default is False when it was True, or more correctly that the default was not True. That is an issue with the programmer (and testing) not with the framework, unless it was undocumented. Django is documented quite well. The programmer here assumed something worked one way that was clearly documented to work the other.<p>Booleans defaulting to False is not unusual, but not universal either. Django has chosen to go the path of explicitness, which is a fine choice to make, as opposed to defaulting to False which is often considered to be a safe choice. I don&#x27;t see a problem with not assigning a default, but I also don&#x27;t see a problem with the default being False.<p>Defaulting to NULL could cause other problems, at least for the programmer above who didn&#x27;t read documentation and worked on assumption.",1383847468

This vertical was a good fit for me because I would do anything to avoid making a phone call (too introverted for that.)<p>I honestly don&#x27;t remember my success rate as it&#x27;s been a long while, but I want to say it was at least 25%. Keep in mind I was pitching a free product that vendors are already used to (there are TONS of wedding vendor directories.)<p>As for scaling, no idea. Some CRMs allow you to mass-send email but I worry about those - feels scummy, though maybe I should just get over that feeling and try it out.<p>Good luck!",1437555598

9928440,comment,9924632,9927181,0,0,thraxil,,,"It&#x27;s useful as part of a layered strategy. Your passwords still need to be secure enough that they can&#x27;t be guessed easily. If they&#x27;re easily brute-forced, fail2ban might slow things down, but it won&#x27;t stop it.<p>Once you have that though, fail2ban does do a nice job of making the perpetual brute force attacks significantly less obnoxious. I&#x27;ve seen machines effectively DDoSed by brute-force ssh attempts, either with the network overloaded or filling up disk with ssh&#x27;s logs of the failed attempts. Not as bad as getting hacked, but still annoying. A serious botnet attack will be able to spread it over thousands of IP addresses, but IME, those are relatively rare. Most attacks are still coming from a handful of hosts at a time and fail2ban basically stops them dead in their tracks.<p>The other useful thing to do with fail2ban is to use it along with a whitelisted range of networks. Even if you aren&#x27;t on a private network, not every server needs ssh open to the entire world. You can often get away with whitelisting the local network and maybe a few ISPs&#x27; ranges where admins are likely to access it from. I run fail2ban even on machines on private networks. If one of the other machines gets hacked, one of the first things they&#x27;ll usually do is start trying to brute-force other machines on the network. Since it will probably only be a couple compromised machines, fail2ban is useful here.<p>I find that it does also give me useful data as well. Eg, I have simple graphite metrics based on the number of bans/minute. If it gets unusually high, I can get an alert and perhaps notice that other hosts have been compromised, or do a quick firewall rule or two to drop packets from an entire network for a while.",1437555575

Not a single French player could explain what the word meant, it was just in the official dictionary, that&#x27;s all.<p>When you organize a Scrabble competition, you need to have an official dictionary or people start inventing non-sense words to get points.

As you &quot;zoom in&quot; on the coast this is what happens to the length:<p>100km > 120km > 128km > 129.5km > 129.52km > 129.528km > 129.6281km > ...<p>If you have to &quot;zoom in&quot; to see a length feature it means that the length feature is small and therefore the contribution to the overall length that these features provide diminishes. Something like a sigmoid[1], it would approach a limit (except in the case of some fractals, but not coastlines) - it can increase infinitely but at tinier and tinier increments. Eventually you reach the size of atoms and you are now talking about fractals and not real-life coastlines.<p>While it would technically apply to rivers as well, the website seems to be using a single significant digit. The above example becomes:<p>100km > 120km > 128km > 129.5km > 129.5km > 129.5km > 129.6km > ...<p>So we can accurately measure a coast/river length up to a specific significant digit.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Sigmoid_curve_for_an_autocatalytical_reaction.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Sigmoid_...</a>",1437554412

The principle is that bends in rivers tend to grow as erosion happens on the outside of the bend and soil deposition on the inside.  This increases sinuosity until the point at which the bend comes full circle, forms an oxbox lake, and returns the local region of the river to a straight line with sinuosity of 1.  The value of pi is supposed to come out when you consider all of a river&#x27;s curves and wiggles on all length scales.<p>The right answer may not be pi, but the data shown make a compelling case that rivers do tend to some average value.<p>As a sidenote, there are active human efforts to keep certain rivers, like the Mississippi, from meandering too far from their current locations.  I don&#x27;t know how many of the world&#x27;s rivers have such efforts being applied to them, but it&#x27;s not unreasonable to think that this could have some effect.",1437554287

Many people also sharpen with sand paper.<p>Carbon steel is completely different than stainless steel which is very difficult to sharpen well.  That is the entire point of buying a good carbon steel knife.  If you send your knife in to the shop to be sharpened, it will basically be dull (or in transit) all of the time.<p>Also, get in the habit of cleaning your knife and putting it away immediately.

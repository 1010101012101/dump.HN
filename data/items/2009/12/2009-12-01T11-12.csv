969597,comment,969526,969526,0,0,smutticus,,,"I get the feeling that the entire purpose of the CRU email leak is to create FUD leading up to Copenhagen.  What exactly was the motive of this anonymous whistleblower?  If the person who leaked these emails had the best interest of climate research in mind why were they conveniently leaked right before Copenhagen?  I do not believe this leak was  done in the interests of clarity because I believe the timing of this leak was significant to the whistleblower.   I do hope this leak leads to more openness in climate research.  But I don't think openness was the motive of the leaker.<p>I also doubt any analysis of these emails and their conclusions so close after the leak.  It will take time and analysis to understand how the supposed infractions and rigged data actually affected the dialogue surrounding climate change.  It's not enough to say someone fudged data.  What we need to see is how that fudged data affected the actual debate over the climate's change.  And that analysis should take longer than a week.",1259668693
969595,story,,,10,18,Towelie,"Ask HN: Clojure as a first progamming language?",,"Hey everyone,<p>Thanks for taking the time to read. I’m interested in trying out Clojure for my first programming language--at least, the first programming language in which I intend to commit myself to becoming proficient. This might make more sense if I give a bit of background on my situation.<p>I have minimal experience (a couple college courses) with Java and C++, and I’ve tinkered with HTML, PHP, et al. on my own time. For a while, I’ve been intent on picking a language to learn for web application development, since got the startup itch. But being the person I am, I had to survey all the possible options first, since this is my first programming language we’re talking about. That wouldn’t matter to a lot of people, and maybe it shouldn’t to anyone, but I feel there’s a chance an experienced programmer has a certain connection with his/her ""native"" programming language, and if so, I want to choose a language worthy of that--none of this Java/C++ nonsense.<p>So after a few months of general web information gathering, I found and became intrigued by the ideas and concepts behind the Lisp family of languages. Being a math guy myself, I felt Lisp might be a more natural fit for my mind, that I might have a stronger natural connection with the language than I would with anything else.
That said, of all the Lisps, I’m leaning toward Clojure at the moment due to its many features which make it far more ideal than most Lisps for say, web applications--which are what I intend to code once I’ve achieved the level of skill necessary.<p>With all that in mind, what do the readers of HN think about choosing Clojure for a first language? Are there any reasons I may want to consider going in a different direction? How necessary is it to be proficient with, for example, Common Lisp or Scheme, before picking up Clojure, for somebody whose mind hasn’t been molded to think in terms of C or Python or Java or whatever?<p>Thanks again for reading. I appreciate any and all responses.",1259668528

969577,comment,968018,968393,0,0,vidarh,,,"I was involved in a similar project <i>ten years ago</i>. At the time we had no problems getting to ca. $500 with a 10.9"" LCD/touch combo, obviously otherwise with very modest specs (a NS x86 clone, 32MB RAM, 16MB flash) but enough to get Opera running on a stripped down Linux with a number of other apps. Sourcing a reasonably priced touch screen was definitively not what killed that project.<p>I'd be very surprised if $300 would've been impossible today, even with a larger screen, though of course that depends on the rest of the specs. Especially given the specs of my new $500 laptop. Sure, it lacks a touch layer, but its also spec'ed far higher than you'd need for a pad like this.",1259667319
969576,comment,967340,969541,0,0,chrischen,,,"> ...but you can't really know until you build the product.
I agree with you completely and this is exactly what I originally said.<p>> If you have a suggestion on how to iterate this type of project, I'm all ears :)
In the end you'll have to answer to reality right? Iteration is a process that's as valid for you as it is for a web startup. It may be a longer process for you because you're working on cutting edge technology, but in the end you still have to answer to reality.<p>Let's say I am designing a user interface. This is something easily testable. I could try a blue colored button and see how users react. Now I must figure out how to change the color of the button to blue. I figure out that if I add background-color:##0000EE to the CSS it accomplishes this. Great! Technical feat accomplished. I think in your situation you want to figure out a) do users want our new database and b) how to create this new database. This would be analogous to a) do users want blue buttons and b) how do I make blue buttons. In web development changing the buttons to blue is trivial, so we can easily test if users actually want blue buttons. Iteration is so much easier in web-development because a lot of the stuff isn't technically challenging. But this doesn't mean other industries like department stores, electronics companies, and database companies don't have to answer to what ultimately works. Your database company, if it largely exists to implement one single idea, and test one single idea, is then simply at the stage of the iteration process where I was figuring out how to technically achieve that one iterative change.<p>But I do agree with you in that in this type of startup, you would probably have to get a little more detailed as to how you operate. I would liken your effort to one of creating a time machine, or a fusion energy engine. If you're implementing something as new and innovative as a time machine, or fusion energy, I would imagine that at this point iteration is of non-concern, because you have yet to even complete one iteration of the idea. But I'm assuming your idea is not as technically challenging or revolutionary as a time machine or fusion energy (no offense!), and that you're getting into the implementation details already (since you mentioned talking to customers and focus groups, I'm guess you've already overcome the majority of the technical challenge).<p>If you don't have a completed product to release and are still in the process of conceptualizing an idea and <i>guiding</i> the evolution about to take place, then you're a little more zoomed into the picture. In this case you don't iterate the idea just yet, but you would iterate the developing idea. In my opinion the best preparation is to look at <i>history.</i> Examine what worked in the past and identify patterns and roots of problems, not just examine the present. History is the combined repository of knowledge acquired from everyone else about what worked and what didn't. You could possibly gain access to some guy who already iterated many things for you and is telling you what he knows. I'm sure it's obvious, but so many of my friends undervalue the importance of history education. Learning from other's mistakes is probably more valuable from learning from your own, since other people, combined, have made way more mistakes. By obtaining past knowledge, this would be the best way to revise your idea before it's completely solidified for the first iteration.<p>If you already completed the core of your product, then there's little recourse to salvaging a faulty product without morphing it completely.
I'm assuming most of your money is spent developing <i>one</i> important technology, and that is the reason why you won't have room to change if it doesn't work? If it doesn't work, then it doesn't work. The point of iteration is to swap out what doesn't work. If it so just happens to be the foundation of all your improvements, then there's no helping that. You could identify a specific reason why it didn't work, and iterate again by replacing that huge undertaking that didn't work. It would still technically be an iteration, from your perspective, even if it means starting a new company with new investors. That core idea may not have worked, but that wouldn't necessarily mean the improvements you got right along the way were bad. They can still be applied to a new core technology that you swap in that works.<p>Iteration is what the people in a business do. The idea is what gets revised in the process. An idea can <i>always</i> get revised, and always should be in order to conform to reality.",1259666946

It's pocket change.<p>My guess is that at the bottom of this there's actual data that shows worrying trends that the involved scientists think are important to continue doing research on, and that some of them fudged it, exaggerated a bit, and polished it a bit to make it easier to ""sell"" it to the politicians in charge of handing out the grant money.<p>But that there's some sort of malicious conspiracy to fool then entire world that everything is going to hell? For what's practically pocket change that pays the salaries of a large group of scientists? No, that makes no sense.<p>And what have they spent the research money on? Hookers and blow? Of course not, it's been spent on climate research and taking us closer to understanding what's happening and what, if anything, we can do about it. Spin-off effects of this is that money has been going into research projects for cleaner energy, more efficient energy use, alternatives to fossil fuel, and all these things are undeniably good.<p>The media hype, that I could live without, and the Copenhagen Climate Conference is becoming I don't know what, but I hope that cooler heads prevail and that actual non-fudged data and science is used there, because there is of course a lot of that, just because the leak showed one instance of bad data, it doesn't mean that the entire thing is bad.",1259666783

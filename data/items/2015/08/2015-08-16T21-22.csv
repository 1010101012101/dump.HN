10070399,comment,10069581,10070265,0,0,danso,,,"OP here: I don&#x27;t necessarily disagree with what you&#x27;ve said here. The &quot;Computational Journalism&quot; class is an elective at Stanford, and while some of the students are from the journalism program, others come from more technical fields such as CS or MSE. The programming part for them is not a huge challenge...but besides the exposure to civic issues and data policy, for some of them, this is the first time they&#x27;ve worked with things like webscraping and public-facing APIs (as was the case for me in my computer engineering degree program, though that was years ago).<p>So there&#x27;s a decent sized group of technically-apt students at Stanford who are interested in journalism. And my advice to them would be to at least intern as traditional reporters, as there&#x27;s no better way to learn the work of developing access and sources (as well as interviewing and writing on deadline!).<p>That said, there are opportunities to quickly explore a domain if you&#x27;re skilled at data collection and analysis. One of the best examples I can think of is this writeup by a couple of data reporters about their investigation into Florida cops:<p><a href=""http://ire.org/blog/on-the-road/2011/12/20/behind-story-tracking-police/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ire.org/blog/on-the-road/2011/12/20/behind-story-trac...</a><p>> <i>This was a case where the government had this wonderful, informative dataset and they weren’t using it at all except to compile the information. I remember talking to one person at an office and saying: “How could you guys not know some of this? In five minutes of (SQL) queries you know everything about these officers?” They basically said it wasn&#x27;t their job. That left a huge opportunity for us.</i><p>This scenario -- in which the data is freely available but no one thinks to simply collect it into a spreadsheet -- is just the tip of the iceberg of data work that needs to be done...but I&#x27;d be lying if I said that this kind of low-hanging fruit was rare...There&#x27;s plenty of information out there that&#x27;s just begging for efficient examination...to paraphrase a classic adage, the problem today is not that we lack information, but we lack ways of filtering and understanding it.<p>I&#x27;ll leave aside the debate of how worthwhile it is to try to teach programming to traditional journalists -- it&#x27;s definitely not easy work...but there&#x27;s a great deal of potential in teaching comsci students about civic and journalistic issues and how specifically to apply their skills. I turned out OK after first spending a few years as a newspaper reporter, but I think I missed some opportunities to hit bigger...but back then, I had no concept of mixing my programming background with my journalism.",1439761920
10070398,comment,10069706,10069706,0,0,gruez,,,">What this means is that if you use sudo to give yourself root privileges, your sudo authentication is not bound to the TTY in which you ran sudo.  It applies to any process you (or malware running as you) start after authentication.  The way Apple ships sudo it is, essentially, a giant privilege escalation vulnerability.<p>But even if you enable TTY tickets, a malicious process on your system can still elevate itself by patching the shell (in memory, using /proc/id/mem) to inject commands alongside the original sudo command. For example:<p>User types:<p><pre><code>    sudo apt-get update
</code></pre>
shell executes:<p><pre><code>    sudo bash -c &quot;apt-get update; evil.sh&quot;</code></pre>",1439761913

10070389,comment,10069884,10069884,0,0,cweagans,,,"I went down the route of trying to build one, and it&#x27;s simply not worth it. To get to a point where you can <i>easily</i> adjust the height on a homemade desk is really, really difficult. You&#x27;re much better off (both in terms of time and finances) with going with a prebuilt solution.<p>Here&#x27;s a few of the commercial options that I considered:<p>* Crank-adjustable desk frame: www.amazon.com/Ergo-Elements-Adjustable-Standing-Black/dp/B00YE6CRY8  with an IKEA desk top, perhaps. I also considered using a solid wood door that a friend was going to give me, but it was quite heavy and looked pretty bad.<p>* The IKEA electric standing desk (Bekant): <a href=""http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S19022530/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S19022530/</a> A couple friends have had mixed success with this one. If you live near an IKEA, go check it out in person.<p>* A fixed standing desk and a tall stool (this is likely the cheapest option and would be the easiest to build yourself). Nothing in particular that I can link to on this one, but if you can find something that has the desk top at > 40&quot; from the ground, that&#x27;s probably a good candidate. I&#x27;m 6&#x27;0&quot; and my standing preset is at 43.5&quot; (sitting is 27&quot; if you&#x27;re curious).<p>* NextDesk - this is the one I ended up going with. I got the Terra (<a href=""http://www.nextdesks.com/terra"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nextdesks.com/terra</a>) and I&#x27;m <i>very</i> happy with it. It&#x27;s expensive, but it felt a lot more solid than many of the other options that I looked into, and at the end of the day, it&#x27;s holding a lot of expensive things. I don&#x27;t want any issues with it, particularly those that result in the damage or destruction of my electronics.<p>A question, though: you said you didn&#x27;t want electronics or a motor. I&#x27;m curious - why not? I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re a developer, and you&#x27;re going to have a computer at your desk, so there&#x27;s likely power nearby.

I could take a gig there at $300k+ if I chose to (a specific offer, which was recently re-extended to me), and most who work for large companies probably approach $200k in total compensation. I know some who are making ~$450k -- not famous developers, so you&#x27;ve probably never heard of them, but good ones.<p>I left the Bay Area a decade ago because, in order to buy a four bedroom house (2 kids+home office) in a good school district, the <i>cheapest</i>, <i>crappiest</i> house would have set me back $1M. A nice house started at $1.2M or so. In the suburbs. And I just didn&#x27;t want to be tied to one of those high-paying jobs. I wanted to be able to quit and do my own thing. So I left that market behind.<p>For Bay Area prices in general, those are typical. Period. The fact that I see a few ~$700k prices on that map means to me that yes, there are some bargains to be had in that area.<p>The only exception is if you have a high tolerance for run-down areas and/or poor schools; lots of cheaper houses in Oakland, for instance, even near Bart stations. THAT&#x27;s where the people who can&#x27;t afford San Francisco, but who work there, should be (and are!) looking. I did a San Francisco commute on Bart for nearly four years, and it&#x27;s not bad. Or live in Alameda and commute on the ferry; that is an <i>awesome</i> commute. Did that for a year as well.<p>But I have a house near Boulder/Denver, Colorado now. Cost: ~$360k. Coming from the Bay Area, I had enough equity to pay cash. Transit: Short walk to two busses that could take me to different parts of Boulder or Longmont (though traffic is low here and I typically drive my Volt, charged with the solar panels on my house). Neighborhood: Short walk to a library, grocery store, about ten restaurants, and two cafes (not counting the Starbucks embedded in the grocery store). Eighteen minute drive to Boulder or Longmont or the north part of Denver.<p>All that and no mortgage. The recruiters who email me face an uphill battle trying to convince me that I want to live in the Bay Area again. I miss my Bay Area friends, for sure. But it would take something really compelling to make me want to return.",1439761354
10070370,comment,10069007,10069414,0,0,TheOtherHobbes,,,"Folk tunes are more complicated than they sound. Jigs, reels, etc are all <i>classes</i> of tune, with broadly similar features. But there are further sub-groupings based on date of composition, composer, and even location.<p>So if you feed an ML system a generic mix of folk tunes without understanding how the subgroupings work, you&#x27;ll get a messy blob of musical data out. It will sound sort-of interesting in a work-in-progress way, but you will always have to hand-edit it to get something acceptable. And even then it will probably be mediocre rather than memorably great. And if it sounds at all good, you&#x27;ll likely find you&#x27;ve created a mashup machine, not a true composer.<p>Really, it&#x27;s like training an ML on &quot;ballads&quot;. You&#x27;ll get a few features that are similar, but everything else will be too noisy to be anything other than a crude attempt.<p>So I think good musical imitation is probably a lost cause, because the rules are so complex and contingent, even for &quot;simple&quot; music, that there simply isn&#x27;t enough consistency to do the job.<p>At the same time the differences from the template create recognisable styles, which have emotional and other associations.

However, there is a twist to this which takes into the time of evaluation, t, of any proposition, x, that a liar would purport.  Basically, as t increases a liar is further incentivised to lie. In fact  t approaching infinity could be considered a non-sequitur. So if there exists the potential to introduce non-sequiturs, your statement can not be evaluated, and therefore you have a continuing incentive to lie and any cumulative lies thereafter have no impedance to their creation. One non-sequitur based lie provokes another, provokes another, ad infinitum (reflect on thoughts of religion or many political stances). *This is actually represented in first order logic simply as False->False = True.<p>What a large t also does, is give a liar the ability to evaluate the value of proposition x given to another person and change p(x) - where p(x) is the probability of actually changing the value of x from false to true before evaluation is performed by the other person. In other words, actually doing what you said you would do in proposition x. This is an immense power. For you can actually decide the value of your next move based on the a response to proposition x from the other person without having to actually do x. Also, the value of x that is found (if past the &#x27;doability&#x27; threshold) can actually dictate the level of quality (and therefore the amount of time required) in which you perform the acts to turn x from false to true.<p>This is the basis for selling a product before it&#x27;s built to evaluate the market demand, &#x27;alias&#x27; writing, and many other such things which require value evaluation prior to execution or attribution. So consider this fact the next time you are thinking of lying. If t is considerably small, then don&#x27;t do it. However if t is fairly large, lie like a rug and use the results to your advantage.",1439760118

I think the main reason for bikers do behave &quot;irresponsible&quot; is to maintain the speed.<p>Like most other modes of transportation, riding a bike means that the most energy is exerted to go from zero to commute-speed. Maintaining the speed requires a lot less energy. Unlike most other modes of transportation that energy comes from your own muscles so you are painfully aware of how much energy each stop costs.<p>I read that in Copenhagen, Denmark, they have designated blue bike lanes and if the rider goes >25kph they will never see a red light, the cars will stop instead.

My fingerprints are easily obtainable by a determined attacker. No question at all; I leave a trail of them around me everywhere I go. What you mentioned being worried about is mass mining of fingerprints–that hashes are being uploaded to some big database. The design of the system is to prevent that. We&#x27;d know if Apple were wholesale uploading fingerprints to its servers. There is no way that someone would not have noticed that happening.<p>Note that the secure enclave is a <i>separate co-processor</i> with its own memory. It&#x27;s secure even if the entire OS kernel is compromised.<p>> Each Secure Enclave is provisioned during fabrication with its own UID (Unique ID)  that is not accessible to other parts of the system and is <i>not known to Apple</i>. [my emphasis] When the device starts up, an ephemeral key is created, entangled with its UID, and used to encrypt the Secure Enclave’s portion of the device’s memory space.
Additionally, data that is saved to the file system by the Secure Enclave is encrypted with a key entangled with the UID and an anti-replay counter.<p>Note that for the &#x27;rogue engineer&#x27; attack, you have to assume that other people at Apple are either colluding with this person or incompetent. Which is not impossible, but it&#x27;s a little more than just blind faith. Note that the secure enclave has existed for over two years now, since the A7 chip was introduced, and we&#x27;re yet to see an attack, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not for lack of trying.

And even the 35mm and 70mm prints in 1977 differed at least in the sound mix.
And the fanedit/despeacialized editions are hard to not find on the internet. I would not call that “Deep Web” :-/",1439758815

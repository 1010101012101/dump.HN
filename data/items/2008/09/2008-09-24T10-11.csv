Would love to hear the thoughts of any angel investors/PG/etc on HN. I know if I'm ever fortunate enough to become an angel investor I'll prefer the companies to be acquired via DCF :).<p>I could be wrong, but with only $21 million in total funding I highly doubt the acquisition price was over $10 MM, and even that seems generous. After taxes, fees and other TPS that 10 turns to 6 or 7 rather quickly.<p>Or if they went the non-liquid route, hopefully they all received a nice chunk of equity in ShareThis. Either way, a multi million dollar payout per founder (there's 3) for a ~year of work is quite nice.",1222253876

313369,comment,313025,313067,0,0,jbert,,,"> the article actually suggestes swapping the caps lock key and the ctrl key to have it better positioned for emacs use...<p>I'd argue that this is ergonmically essential for long-term emacs use, otherwise you run the risk of 'emacs claw'.<p>Took me less than a week to get used to it. If you regularly use other people's machines then it's not a good idea (but then, neither is emacs unless you are carrying around your .emacs file, since you'll miss all your personal keybindings).",1222252550

wet field: a combo of rice+azolla+sheep+duck+fish
dry field: a combo of rice+white clover<p>Similarly, i wanted to play with microcontrolled fish-keeping, pump, filter, aerator, heater, fertilizer ... fancy stuff<p>Simpler, no-tech natural solution again exists:
just use soil+aqua plant+sunlight<p>Really, nature amazes me to no end, to the point that i hate my engineering knowledge ... i truly concern that my creation will be inferior to nature<p>For reference, the natural books:

A couple of times I've imagined a really cool feature that vim could have... and it turned out it <i>already has it</i> ... along with additional features and extensions to that idea that I hadn't begun to imagine... whoa... That's a rare and impressive experience (for me), and it gave vim a special place in my heart.<p>But I agree with you that the same thing would be true of emacs too.<p>Vim is a huge mess/mass of features, and if you don't already know about a feature, the help isn't very helpful (googling works better). Emacs scripting is probably more regular, being based on a full language.",1222252108

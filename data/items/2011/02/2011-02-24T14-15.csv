2, A thunderstorm knocked out the power to our datacenter, the backup UPS and generators both failed to engage. (lasted a day, we also took our business elsewhere)<p>After the 2nd outage we decided to take up additional colo space elsewhere in the country.  This has worked for years and any failures in our life datacenter have quickly been switched over to a hot backup datacenter.<p>We have had around a half dozen minor interruptions caused by server component failures ( psu / hard drive).  This is because it takes a few minutes to detect the failure and switch over to a backup.<p>3, The last major failure was with our DNS hosting.  They decided to scratch our main zone from there records because of a billing error.  Luckily for us it happened on the Friday before a weeks school holiday.  Needless to say we took our business elsewhere.<p>I'm sure we have had other instances of downtime I can't remember, but that's pretty much us in a nutshell.  No idea what our uptime on paper would be, funnily.",1298559581

2258076,comment,2257327,2257789,0,0,soulclap,,,"When I said PEAR I referred to the pear.php.net packages being PHP4 style and dependent on PEAR_Error and all. I am aware of the fact that Symfony and a couple of other large projects are available via PEAR distribution servers.<p>Haven't seen pear2.php.net before though but after a quick look just now - with just a couple of libs and hardly any updates in 2011, it doesn't look like it's doing very well. And again it seems to have dependencies and wants you to use custom error libraries.<p>And I am not sure what you mean to say regarding most code being jailed and this being a 'misconception'. If you aren't on PHP 5.3, you can't even find a lightweight (means not Doctrine) working standalone implementation of ActiveRecord, although lots of frameworks provide similar functionality. Just one example. And looking at the other comments here I don't seem to be the only one who noticed this.<p>And it's not that I am not seeing what's going on. I see that Symfony2 is making an effort but haven't worked with it yet.

Get people to buy their first app and you've opened up a whole new level of potential. The first purchase is probably the biggest hurdle to repeat business...take an app that a lot of people will talk about, that a lot of people will say is worth it, and charge $0.99.<p>Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but it seems genius to me.",1298556266

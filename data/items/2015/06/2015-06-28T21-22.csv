9795253,comment,9792234,9793362,0,0,bitmapbrother,,,"These are also from the Snowden leaks and they detail far more than just methodology, but rather examples of the actual information they&#x27;re collecting - courtesy of Microsoft.<p>July 31, 2012<p>Microsoft (MS) began encrypting web-based chat with the introduction of the new outlook.com service. This new Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption effectively cut off collection of the new service for FAA 702 and likely 12333 (to some degree) for the Intelligence Community (IC). MS, working with the FBI, developed a surveillance capability to deal with the new SSL. These solutions were successfully tested and went live 12 Dec 2012. The SSL solution was applied to all current FISA and 702/PRISM requirements - no changes to UTT tasking procedures were required. The SSL solution does not collect server-based voice/video or file transfers. The MS legacy collection system will remain in place to collect voice/video and file transfers. As a result there will be some duplicate collection of text-based chat from the new and legacy systems which will be addressed at a later date. An increase in collection volume as a result of this solution has already been noted by CES.<p>March 15, 2013<p>SSO&#x27;s PRISM program began tasking all Microsoft PRISM selectors to Skype because Skype allows users to log in using account identifiers in addition to Skype usernames. Until now, PRISM would not collect any Skype data when a user logged in using anything other than the Skype username which resulted in missing collection; this action will mitigate that. In fact, a user can create a Skype account using any e-mail address with any domain in the world. UTT does not currently allow analysts to task these non-Microsoft e-mail addresses to PRISM, however, SSO intends to fix that this summer. In the meantime, NSA, FBI and Dept of Justice coordinated over the last six months to gain approval for PRINTAURA to send all current and future Microsoft PRISM selectors to Skype. This resulted in about 9800 selectors being sent to Skype and successful collection has been received which otherwise would have been missed.<p>March 7, 2014<p>PRISM now collects Microsoft Skydrive data as part of PRISM&#x27;S standard Stored Communications collection package for a tasked FISA Amendments Act Section 702 (FAA702) selector. This means that analysts will no longer have to make a special request to SSO for this - a process step that many analysts may not have known about. This new capability will result in a much more complete and timely collection response from SSO for our Enterprise customers. This success is the result of the FBI working for many months with Microsoft to get this tasking and collection solution established.",1435528314

GNOME, Unity, Pantheon, XFCE, LXDE, Mate, Cinnamon, etc. all work best with GTK. With some of the heavier weight desktops, Qt apps look quite out of place, kind of like how cross platform UI apps look on Mac and Windows.<p>Since most Qt apps on linux come from the KDE ecosystem, they often pull in a lot of KDE dependancies, which means a lot of extra packages lying around your system, creating clutter, which might bother some people. The relatively heavyweight nature of most Qt apps makes them less appropriate on systems that use just a window manager rather than a full desktop environment.<p>Sure, a lot of GTK apps pull in a bunch of GNOME dependancies, but there&#x27;s also a large contingent of GTK apps from the lighter-weight XFCE world that don&#x27;t.<p>Outside of linux, Qt has won pretty decisively, mostly because the GTK developers aren&#x27;t interested in making GTK apps look good on Mac/Windows, so long as they run.",1435528051

9795176,comment,9794694,9794694,0,0,bobjordan,,,"Shenzhen China factory owner here.<p>The costs are definitely rising in China for English speaking technical labor such as the engineers we need. We compete with companies like Apple and all the other foreign companies rushing to China these days to keep them employed. But we are still talking much lower salaries overall, for example,  $30,000 USD/year for a degreed Sr. Electrical design engineer with 20 years experience.<p>Regarding rents, the Shenzhen central business section rents are expensive now and cost/sqft comparable to anywhere else. However, good industrial space is still far cheaper, for example, I just leased an additional 12,000 sqft high quality assembly space with low ESD floors in a technical park along with 8 dorm rooms to sleep up to 32 people (4 per room - last owner had 8 per room).   Lease on this new space cost me $3500 per month. There is also a kitchen ran by the tech park where they serve 3 hot buffet style meals per day for $2/day/worker.  I&#x27;m not aware of anyplace in USA where you can lease a space like this for $0.29 per square foot nor get a buffet meal for $0.66 cents nor have door rooms for workers.  Now, it is competitive to find this space and you need to lease when you find it not wait 1 day, it took us 4 months searching and we lost several spaces waiting 1-2 days, but it exists.<p>But ultimately what is far cheaper here in China and the main reason I must remain here to make money is for the lower cost of the materials required to actually build the products.<p>There is a critical mass of suppliers here where you can find half dozen capable suppliers for nearly anything you&#x27;d need to buy.  For example we do a lot of custom molded plastic parts and many times I can make multiple cavity hard (300K shot life) injection mold tools for plastics for $3K-$5K USD and it would cost 5x or even 10x as much to buy them in USA.  No less, bolts, nuts, screws, electronics all vastly cheaper here.<p>Lastly, as someone else noted, the cost of shipping is much cheaper when you originate your shipping quotes from a Chinese account, especially for air shipping to USA, rates originating from my China company&#x27;s Fedex account is routinely 50% cheaper than what Fedex quotes in the USA. This really adds up when you need to ship stuff around the world quickly.",1435526882

You need 10.000 connections, each running 3 req/s for 30.000 req/s. So we are not trying to maximize the system. We are trying to saturate it over a long period with a constant load. And you need to use wrk2 (also from Gil Tene) because otherwise the load generator and the System-under-test ends up coordinating among themselves, hiding the fact that some of the 10.000 connections are starved to get more req/s through on a subset.<p>The Java frameworks are very very good at handling 512 connections and throwing as many requests through those as possible. What they fail at, is 10.000 connections. What usually happens in bad load generators is that they allow the Java code to starve, say 9500 of those connections while getting all the good numbers on the last 500. wrk2 doesn&#x27;t allow that to happen, and starvation is counted against the SUT.<p>As for the source, you would have to wait.

These people are willing to defend it even if they are burned by it -- the &quot;temporarily embarrassed millionaires&quot; syndrome.<p>Yes, being brought up on the east side of Warsaw in a crime-ridden neighborhood with a family struggling from paycheck to paycheck can easily make a man jaded and grim. Here he is right.<p>But you, jwr, are right, he&#x27;s grossly exaggerating. Poland has moved really far and really fast over last 11 years -- thanks to all the EU money. I fear the times the money would run out.<p>Still, it&#x27;s a bit foolish (no offence intended) to even attempt praising it over Western Europe. Poland is still at the beginning on the road to a real democratic, prosperous country. Most of all we need to finally shed this conservative clot that&#x27;s holding us back and sometimes even making us and object of ridicule in Europe.<p>To come back to the original topic, for me personally it has been really worrying for years that we look towards US with these dreamy, hungry eyes. Ever since the big transformation of the 90&#x27;s we blindly copy and import wholesome their ideas never asking if we should.<p>We should really look more to our Western European friends or even more successful countries from our &quot;bloc&quot; (Slovenia, Czech Republic). There&#x27;s still much to be done to improve our workers&#x27; rights, health care, social security, etc.<p>It&#x27;s a false dichotomy between the US and Poland as we&#x27;re basically gravitating to their end with the EU actually being on the opposite one.",1435525559

11002,comment,10748,10914,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"You're asking ""why not add complexity?""  Not a good place to start.<p>If a project needs a database you'll know it pretty quickly...and it's easy to convert to using a database at that point.  The only time I've ever regretted a decision about databases was when I designed a log processor that didn't immediately have relational needs...over a couple of weeks of implementing the requirements I ended up writing a relational layer in Perl against a Berkeley DB backend.  That was stupid, and I should have thought a little harder about the requirements.  But it was my first big solo project, so I blame inexperience for not recognizing a relational problem from the start.  Luckily, SQLite had just been released, and converting my app to use it (and losing a hundred lines of code) was a one day operation.  It made the app approximately 100 times faster for my data set.<p>But, well over half of my applications since then have not required a database and have been well-served by flat files.",1176159509

10999,comment,10748,10748,0,0,philc,,,"Rails + Mysql<p>My webapps are requiring a lot of client side logic to be really interactive, so I've found that the biggest producivity factor is what I'm doing with Javascript. The Rails code I've been writing is mostly trivial; as long as it lets me talk to the database easily, I feel like any language could be used on the backend. However, I do love scripting in Ruby, and Rails makes it easy to use its DB abstractions in external scripts.<p>The best gains on the client-side come from using a good library. I've gone from Prototype/scriptaculous to YUI-ext to Mootools. I love Mootools. I've never been able to bring myself to try Dojo; it seems like it's trying to put the Java back into Javascript. What do you think?",1176159113

10992,comment,10781,10855,0,0,papersmith,,,"I agree that HTML+javascript has serious limitations.  But eventually GUI complexity can be managed through good APIs (XUL, flex), and high-bandwidth apps can be delivered through plugins that use lower-level protocols (flash).  The current state of these technologies still seem less-than-optimal, but I can see a lot of effort being put into making things more transparent and efficient.",1176157599

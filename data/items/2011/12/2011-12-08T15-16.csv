It's not an argument for adding more. I would also agree that in the hypothetical case of Dart support being added to WebKit that Google would be expected to maintain their code, just as Apple would be expected to maintain OS X stuff.<p>But again, I think the original conversation was had at cross-purposes. What started as a conversation about hosting a branch of WebKit to do some innovating turned into a conversation about standards and the broader web. In the former case it's a purely technical question of where the work is done, but in the latter, I think the ""participate in the web standards community"" bit comes in to play. Why did Google come directly to WebKit to ask about integrating Dart instead of talking to e.g. the W3C or WHATWG?",1323359944

3329545,comment,3328030,3328030,6,0,bphogan,,,"I teach Rails a <i>lot</i>. I've ranted and raved for the last year how Rails 3 is much harder for a beginner to grasp than previous versions, but the things that make it difficult for the beginners are not specifically Rails itself. Usually the  difficulties come from a few specific things:<p>First, it's the absolutely fragmented ecosystem, made up of everyone who has opinions on the best way to do Rails development. ""You need this gem, and this gem, and ZOMG you're using that library? So last week! Use this one!""<p>Sure, it's funny to exaggerate that, but if you joined a community, you'd probably look around. A person who does daily work in Rails is going to have a preferred development stack. They may write tests with Rspec, they may use Cucumber. They may even use CoffeeScript. And they'll tell a newbie that they should too.<p>But a wide-eyed developer who thinks Rails will solve all his or her problems will get freaked out at all of the options available.<p>When I teach beginners, I don't teach RSpec or Cucumber, and I try to even avoid talking about Bundler. I stick with the core components of Rails. I stay on the happy path.  
Rails has all these hooks for experts that you can unravel after a few months (or years) of daily work. But a beginner can understand ActiveRecord, controllers, and views easily.<p>I love the Dreyfus Model. It basically says newbies don't need choices in the beginning. They need clear instruction, clear tutorials. Once they master those, they can move on to reading the docs, exploring the options, etc.<p>I've been pretty successful teaching Rails to folks who know how to program.<p>Where Rails falls flat on its face for the beginner is when the beginner doesn't know SQL or HTML. That's a whole different ballgame. Then something like Sinatra is a nice slow introduction.",1323359684

At what point do humans controlling their environment cease being humans? So yes, you could sit absolutely still and live a tremendously-rewarding virtual life because you have designed a world that emotionally compels you to never leave. To the rest of us, you look like a potted plant. Does that make you less human? Or, to put differently, if you were completely paralyzed, yet were able to think (I believe they call it ""locked in"") is there anything wrong with you that the rest of us should care about and fix? Is how we define being a human inexorably linked to physical social participation? I believe so, but I'm not comfortable with my own line of reasoning here.<p>Note that I don't have a problem with us evolving into something else. My only concern is that we acknowledge what's happening so that we can realistically talk about it. If we are evolving, then there will be a selection function that we had get pretty damn good at meeting. I imagine that function is going to be the ability to turn the system off from time to time. What I see instead is millions of folks who spend more time than even they are happy with plugged in and are in a great bit of denial as to exactly what social effect that is having. If you ask me, the singularity is already here. We just can't see it.",1323359213

It's true that we have to know the political climate, but the political climate you're looking at is only a small part of it.<p>If this bill is passed, it will not only hurt people of a particular ethnicity, but everyone and the whole IT industry in the country.<p>Given the track record of the incumbent political party, I strongly believe that most of the 'registered' people will be the people who are very close to them. The 'registered' people will make use of their status to get themselves into rent-seeking activities to take advantages of the companies/people who genuinely want to start up an IT company or involve in an IT project. This will in turn hurt the IT industry in Malaysia, which is already very weak due to current rent-seeking activities. What will happen eventually? More brain drain to the country, and not to forget a stagnant, if not backward-moving, IT industry in Malaysia.<p>You only see the racial thing here because you are not looking at the bigger picture. It's true enough that the 'registered' people will most probably be ethnic Malays, but those are ethnic Malays who are close to the incumbent party. The majority of the ethnic Malay will get as little as the ethnic Chinese get.<p>EDIT:<p>> University places are allocated based on racial quotas. Therefore, the people who are most concerned by this legislation are ethnic Chinese, who are more likely find themselves disqualified from doing certain work due to their inability to access higher education places.<p>It's true that qualified ethnic Chinese are having less chance to enter the public colleges, but most of them who can't get into public colleges go for private colleges or study abroad instead. In average, the literacy and qualification of ethnic Chinese is higher than other ethnics in Malaysia. So it's untrue to say that they are concerned due to their inability to access higher education. While there probably is an issue of education equality but the bill does not relate to the issue.",1323359212

  WebKit aims for compliance with relevant web standards,

  new standards are practical to implement in our engine.
  We use regression testing to maintain our standards compliance
  gains.

Clearly, one of their goals is to help bring new technologies into standards, as evidenced by first implementing CSS animations, transitions, and transforms, and other various -webkit- things, and then submitting them to standard bodies. Plus there are some code paths in WebKit that only apply to OS X Dashboard, which are really the maintenance burden, given that some OS X relevant bugs are kept in Apple's closed rdar system (I know this because I helped find a bug in canvas).

3329432,comment,3326425,3328234,1,0,shadowfiend,,,"Well, a few thoughts. I haven't looked into this in detail, of course, but some general ones:
 - In this particular case, the issue in question was that one justice's wife (Justice Breyer) owned stock in Nestl, which acquired Prometheus Laboratories, one of the parties in the case, this year. This fact seems to have come out during the case, and the justice's wife ultimately sold her stock before the case began. Nestl has pretty powerful brand recognition, so it seems silly to read foul play in that particular interaction. Asking justices to never engage in stock trade and, worse, never allow their families to do so, just in case a situation like this should arise, would be somewhat foolish. We rely instead on disclosure of interests and the ability to recuse oneself if a justice chooses not to clear a conflict of interest.
 - I don't know of too many <i>financial</i> conflicts that have arisen in the court, particularly recently, that haven't been solved either by something like the above or by recusal.
 - It's possible you're referring to the issues regarding the healthcare law and the fact that Justice Thomas's wife has campaigned against it. If so, I'd like to see the evidence that she has taken hundreds of thousands of dollars in lobbying money. I'm not saying it hasn't happened, just that I haven't seen anyone mention money changing handspeople are mentioning a potential conflict of interest that she's advocating against it, but that's a different matter entirely.",1323358209

For each new type of data structure, a vendor would provide a pattern library identifying the basic structure of the data, which the software would then use to ""extract the constructs of interest from the document,"" Weaver said.<p>So how does the above fit into the Unix Philosophy's dictum that ""Everything is just a stream of bytes (of text)?""

It works in Ubuntu (Chrome or Firefox).<p>Playing with: <a href=""http://ipinfo.info/netrenderer/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ipinfo.info/netrenderer/index.php</a> it seems that Internet Explorer won't display the strikeout characters because the font on HN is set to Verdana, which doesn't have the combining character. If I create a page without specifying the font, it works fine.<p>I have Verdana on my system, but the browsers and font libraries I have installed mean that the glyph is taken from another font when one is missing. I'm surprised Windows 7 browsers don't do the same. Or maybe you don't have the glyph in <i>any</i> font, which would also be disappointing.<p>Of course, a real webpage would use <strike> or CSS, and strikeouts are usually poor typography anyway, except as part of lame jokes. But other unicode combining-characters can be of real use.",1323356811

I can guarantee that were we to establish a mandatory governing body, a degree would be required.<p>Hell, in Florida they require <i>Interior Decorators</i> to have  an approved degree (very narrow definition of approved degree too, I might add).<p>In Georgia (where I live), the board who overseas General Contractors, ruled they have $1,000,000 in assets in addition to the insurance they were already required to have to cover damages.

3329308,story,,,12,32,whatdoyouthink,"Ask HN: Please Review My Startup: What Do You Really Think About Me?",,"Hello HN! We are about to launch a new site and would welcome feedback. The site can be found here: www.whatdoyoureallythinkabout.me?<p>Overview: Feedback helps us learn how other people see and experience us. The problem is we are not great at giving or getting feedback. We struggle with giving feedback because it is often against the rules of our society to give honest feedback. We fear that we might risk the relationship or hurt the other persons feelings, so we avoid it. This is often to the detriment of the other person. It can be a minor thing like your boss having terrible breath, but no one telling him. Or, it can be more serious like a friend with an abusive girlfriend or boyfriend. Everyone around them knows that the relationship is bad for them and is hurting them, but no one can risk telling the person. Consequently, the person stays in the bad relationship for months or years. Then, when it finally ends and they <i>see</i> how they were being treated they ask, ""Why didn't you tell me?"" We stumble and say that we didn't want to hurt their feelings or we say we ""hinted"" at it, but were not too clear. Well, this site solves that problem. It allows us to give anonymous feedback to people who need to hear it without jeopardizing the relationship with them. Moreover, it provides a framework to help people learn from the feedback.<p>Getting feedback can also be awkward. We all want it and need it, but don't know how to ask for it. This site provides an easy way to ask for feedback from people you trust and/or others you do not yet know.<p>Items we could use specific feedback on include:<p>1. Concept/Idea of the site<p>2. Virality - We were modeling the viral mechanics of the site after www.threewords.me and felt particularly validated when epi0Bauqu recommended that strategy (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2168220). The aim of the site is significantly different, but we thought itd be a good starting point. Any thoughts on ways we can increase traction?<p>3. Design/flow<p>4. Minimizing Harassment  - Perhaps the greatest problem is that people could use the site to give wrong and/or harmful feedback to others (e.g., they could give feedback bombs instead of feedback gifts). We have clearly spelled out in our Terms of Service, and before they can send feedback, that this type of behavior is not allowed or tolerated. Additionally, we have made the site only available to those 18 and older, because kids often don't have the best judgment when it comes to interacting with others. We believe that the positives outweigh the negatives and that we can work towards minimizing these challenges, while maximizing opportunities for people to learn from others. That said, wed especially welcome feedback on how to limit this type of behavior.",1323356626

You're not going to be able to calculate your airspeed from the groundspeed within that margin.  (FWIW, I'm pretty sure this GPS speed information is available in the cockpit already.  If not, you can get it off your iPhone if you really care.)<p>Finally, the flaps-down speed range of a Cessna 152 is 35-85 kts.  So if you're facing into 85kt winds with the flaps down, you're flying backwards and are overspeed.  (This can happen with the flaps up too, of course, but winds of 149 kts are a little hard to believe :)",1323356590

Second, not sure I'd call FF or Chrome niche.<p>Not paying too much attention to IE (IE8 specifically) is a strategy worth doing. It's a pain in the ass to support IE8 and not worth the extra development time in the short term. Plus, not sure if this applies to this startup (I'd say it does), users like those in HN (the majority of whom use FF or Chrome) are the users you want initially to use and support your startup. If they like it, they become quite the dedicated user, which really helps to get your startup off the ground initially. So targeting FF and Chrome users is hardly a bad strategy for release 1. Adding IE8 in the mix is way more frustration than it's worth.",1323356528

169257,comment,169197,169197,0,0,inovica,,,"There are LOADS of companies like this.  I run a few small ones myself that generate good revenue.  Software-related is our www.sourceguardian.com site.  Like most things we solved a problem for our own needs and then turned it into a product.  We have a healthy income from this which isn't far from being 'passive income'.  My suggestion would be to look at a problem that hasn't been solved, or hasn't been solved well.  We pick niche markets for what we do and that works well for us.  I know of many companies like this.",1208771708

169253,comment,168635,169095,0,0,wheels,,,"This is quite inaccurate.  There exist jobs for which the above are true, but not most.<p><i>If you're concerned about learning...</i>  Sure, but it'll be completely different stuff.<p><i>If you're concerned about having a mentor...</i> Or not.  Real leaders in the corporate world are rare.<p><i>If you're concerned about money...</i>  Not really.  If you've worked and then go back and got an MBA you come back at mid-management.<p>I'm hardly a cheerleader for MBAs, but the stuff that you've written here is a little too typical, ""hacker with a chip on his shoulder"".  I've seen a lot of people learn good stuff in MBA programs and I've seen more waste their time.  It's not one size fits all.",1208771131

169251,comment,169197,169228,0,0,RyanGWU82,,,"I'm a paid subscriber of Remember the Milk, but I don't think they do a good job differentiating their paid product from the free product.  I subscribed because I felt that $24.95 was a fair price for a superior mobile interface, but there aren't many other benefits for paid customers.<p>37signals does this differently.  Their free products are far more limited, and their paid products offer quite a few more features than their free products.  This limits the value to the freeloading customer, but I think this makes for a more sustainable business in the long-run.",1208770403
169250,comment,169197,169245,0,0,RyanGWU82,,,"The term ""enterprise software"" usually refers to software products sold to very large companies, or at least ""small and medium businesses"" which have 200-500 employees. David's examples were geared more toward the ""Fortune 5,000,000"" -- the much larger market of small businesses with a handful of employees.<p>The economics of the ""Fortune 5,000,000"" are very different than true enterprise software, as it avoids employing a direct sales force.  Obviously 37signals wouldn't turn away a team from General Motors who wanted to use Basecamp, but they don't actively market their products to large companies.<p>You're right about the difficulty of charging for online products in the consumer market.  DHH said that they were having trouble getting customers for their personal organization product, Backpack, even at $5 a month. After they repositioned Backpack to be used by small businesses, they were able to increase the price and sales still grew tremendously.",1208770184

169236,story,,,5,5,mstefff,"Ask HN: Legality of RSS Feed Usage in Web Apps?",,"I cannot seem to find a solid answer to this question, so where better to turn? I am in the middle of developing a web application that utilizes a number of RSS feeds from the leading sites in a given industry. Just to point out, these feeds are all partial feeds and usually nothing more than the title/link is displayed. About 90% of the websites providing the RSS feeds display some sort of disclaimer regarding the feeds: ""for personal, non-commercial use by individuals only. The feeds are free of charge for use by individuals, as long as the feeds are used for such individual’s personal, non-commercial use.""<p>Now I can't help but notice the endless amount of commercial (some form of advertising) websites that use RSS feeds from other sites, as well as web-based RSS readers which are basically profiting from the same thing.<p>So, what exactly is the legality here? Wouldn't these sites encourage commercial sites to utilize their feeds to direct traffic back to them?<p>Thanks..",1208768904

It’s a big change for people used to keyboards. Why the mouse?<p>>Jobs: If I want to tell you there is a spot on your shirt, I’m not going to do it linguistically: “There’s a spot on your shirt 14 centimeters down from the collar and three centimeters to the left of your button.” If you have a spot—“There!” [he points]—I’ll point to it. Pointing is a metaphor we all know. We’ve done a lot of studies and tests on that, and it’s much faster to do all kinds of functions, such as cutting and pasting, with a mouse, so it’s not only easier to use but more efficient.<p>Amazing.

&quot;In other operating systems, I hated learning one language for command line scripts and another for programming.  With TempleOS, the command line feeds right into the HolyC compiler, line by line, and it places code into memory it MAlloc()s. The compiler is paused at the command line, waiting for input. Naturally, you #include a program to load it into memory and, usually, start it. 
 During the boot process, many files get compiled before you have access to the command line. (Don&#x27;t worry, booting takes only a couple of seconds.) All the header declarations for the operating system are compiled and are available for use in your programs without needing to #include them.  Everything is truly  compiled to native x86_64 machine code, nothing is interpreted and there is no byte code.&quot;",1427068628

I&#x27;ll admit unions played a <i>significant</i> role in improving the workplace for everyone, and we should all be thankful for their contributions 50+ years ago. But they are now primarily self-serving organizations that exist for the benefit of the union itself.<p>Before becoming a developer I worked in hotels (as a banquet manager), let me give you some examples of the types of things unions now fight for:<p>* a dishwasher cannot wash pots and a potwasher cannot wash dishes<p>* only an electrician can change the batteries in a TV remote or change a lightbulb<p>* when it&#x27;s busy your manager(s) cannot help you<p>* re-hiring of employees who were terminated because they were caught stealing or physically assaulting other employees<p>The better an employee is the less they benefit from a union. It results in good employees not getting paid as well as they could be and bad employees sticking around because it&#x27;s difficult (or impossible) to fire them.<p>We could certainly benefit from the types of professional association lawyers[1] and doctors[2] have, but those are quite different than unions.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Bar_Association"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Bar_Association</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Medical_Association"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Medical_Association</a>",1427068619

Aristotle’s main study of Homer did not survive. It is listed in Diogenes Laertius&#x27; &quot;Life of Aristotle&quot; as &quot;Six books of Homeric problems.&quot;<p>> Many ancient Greek writers discussed topics and problems in the Homeric epics, but the development of scholarship <i>per se</i> revolved around three goals: (1) Analyzing internal inconsistencies within the epics; (2) Producing editions of the epics&#x27; authentic text, free of interpolations and errors; [and] (3) Interpretation: both explaining archaic words, and exegetical interpretation of the epics as literature.<p>> there was also a fashion for allegory, especially among the Stoics. The most notable passage is a scholion on Iliad 20.67, which gives an extended allegorical interpretation of the battle of the gods, explaining each god as symbolic of various elements and principles in conflict with one another, e.g., Apollo is opposed to Poseidon because fire is opposed to water.",1427068302

He discusses specifically the problem of unions... and the problem of capital. If you have the time, please watch and/or read this essay.<p>A very, very brief summary:<p>Unions are absolutely necessary, but not because of some specific feature they might achieve. Instead, they are a <i>check</i> on capital. (and vice versa). Similar to our &quot;adversarial&quot; judicial system - where each side is <i>expected</i> to fight hard for their own interests - it is the struggle between labor and capital that produces a working economy. If either side actually gets what they want, the system becomes pathological.<p>So yes, unions are an inefficiency. That was the intended effect. There is a lot of hostility in this very thread to the idea that &quot;those people&quot; - in this case, &quot;people I see as &#x27;lower-quality engineers&#x27;&quot; - might be getting something they &quot;don&#x27;t deserve&quot;. Or the fear might be that helping the bottom end would require taking from someone else, as if the economy was some zero-sum game. Yes, <i>some amount</i> of those effect was the <i>goal</i>.<p>The alternative that says some variation of &quot;fsck you, I&#x27;ve got mine&quot; may betray a lack of empathy in the speaker, but in most cases I suspect it betrays a belief in one of our most damaging cultural myths: the &quot;just world&quot; fallacy we call the &quot;free market&quot;.<p>The question isn&#x27;t really about unions. Instead, the question to ask yourself is &quot;are we in this together?&quot; Do you want a society with a functioning economy or not? Or do you want to let us continue our slide back into feudalism... and probably some sort of violent rebellion in the long run.<p>To make society work, it might require occasionally <i>helping</i> those that are less fortunate. Just like we do with &quot;taxes&quot; and &quot;health insurance&quot;. Forming a union <i>and participating in it</i> might be one of the ways you can provide input on how these issues should be managed.",1427068161

For example, you can say that edge A has the same length as edge B, and it mirrors across plane C, which is 10 cm away from the primary XY plane.<p>This is essential to my workflow in 3D modeling and makes most geometry based operations (such as specifying that edge A is 10cm and starts at 3,4) obsolete. It also allows easy assemblies: you can specify the axis of shaft A need to be coincidental with the axis of hole B.<p>Plain text based 3D modelling would be awesome as you can use reasonable revision controls and have reasonable merge strategies.. but the lack of parametric modelling, at least for me, is a deal breaker.

For what are essentially fragile but persistent bubbles, transparency is bad.<p>Dealers want to be able to tell stories about pieces and their rarity, without a large market to let buyers verify them, and want to be able to hide sales, letting them inflate prices as much as possible. They certainly don&#x27;t want anyone to be able to compare prices. Buyers want to be able to get special access to sales of pieces (or what they think is special access), or want to find people who don&#x27;t know the value of what they have.<p>It&#x27;s interesting hearing people in the hobby talk about these things. Dealers will rant about eBay and its dangers, or about buyers who &quot;don&#x27;t want to pay enough&quot; (meaning they didn&#x27;t sell that piece at all). Buyers will talk about how so-and-so contacted them first about a new piece, or about the amazing rarity of pieces that nevertheless seem to show up pretty often, or about how values appreciate with time. Unsurprisingly, doing painstaking research on auction sales over the last several decades, my friend found that values of most pieces did not even outpace inflation. Somehow, this didn&#x27;t dissuade him. The hobby/bubble in its current form, though, is dying, and that&#x27;s a good thing.<p>This is even more the case for collecting bubbles that are based around items currently being manufactured, as there is always the possibility of just creating more, and that risk is highest when everyone knows what is going on. In this case, for example, the manufacturer was easily able to destroy the dealer&#x27;s business, but did so because the pieces were being very publicly sold. Had he instead kept everything quiet, and sold privately, he could have kept up what was essentially a scam for much longer.",1427066551

There&#x27;s a range of what vectorization might mean (you can vectorize code and do a bad job with it, only marginally beating out the scalar code), so you&#x27;d still need to check the generated code for the situations where you care.<p>And honestly, it&#x27;s not worth the effort.

For example, authors may make claims without sufficient data to support their arguments or they might not explain a particular anomaly in their results. There are nuances in papers everywhere, try to pick these these out as you read them.<p>Secondly, you will at times read papers which assume a particular level of prior background knowledge. For example, I&#x27;ve had to read papers on rateless codes (Spinal Codes), indoor passive radar and full duplex radio with zero background in electrical engineering or physics. 6 months ago I would look at some of the equations and think &quot;nope, not even going to try and understand that&quot;. This is bad, don&#x27;t do it. If you don&#x27;t understand the equation at first glance (and I would be surprised if you did) break it down piece by piece. Annotate what each variable/Greek letter represents, how it fits together with their explaination of the equation and how it might fit a trend shown in their results. Sometimes you might find that you have to do extensive Googling to understand whole papers, don&#x27;t worry, in my experience this is perfectly normal.<p>Finally, if you don&#x27;t understand something, don&#x27;t continue reading. Try to understand it before progressing. Only continue reading if you absolutely cannot get it. If you find that a lack of understanding of an earlier part of the paper starts to limit your understanding of later parts, stop! Go back and re-read the earlier parts. Quite often, material later in the paper can adequately explain concepts earlier on.<p>Best of luck!",1427066002

Optimizations might clutter up the code and make the intent not clear. Writing idiomatic code and hoping that the compiler figures it out is also suboptimal, as noted by the grandparent.<p>I think the best solution is to be able to make some kind of annotation, or other way of declaration, on a function that says &quot;this function should be no worse than this&quot;. In Scala&#x27;s case, for example tailrec. I&#x27;m unfortunately having a hard time with coming up with other, specific examples, but the gist of it is that the compiler either manages to do all the work on the function itself and the functions that that function calls, or errors out and reports what it <i>couldn&#x27;t</i> do. Ideally I would want to make 10 functions which are all pure and referentially transparent, call all those functions from a top function with some kind of annotation that gives some demands with regards to optimizations, and then have that function be transformed to a single, efficient, fused loop with no allocations or intermediary values that are unnecessary.

They do not necessarily do this thing, and some do not. The common failure mode is that an entrenched union is run by a group of people who act very much like company management, profit immensely from this arrangement, and remain in power by employing forms of the pirate ship loot splitting strategy.<p>(The pirate ship captain must propose a split of the loot, which the crew votes on. If they vote in favour, the loot split goes ahead, and if not then the captain is thrown overboard. The correct solution is to divide the loot equally between 51% of the crew including the captain, and allocate none to the rest.)<p>The worst unions are definitely not a framework for laziness, but they do tend to be bad for businesses as their primary function is to suck money out of the company and give it to union leaders. The best unions make everybody better off, including the employers. Some companies have internalised the functions of the best unions, because they realised that this makes everybody better off, so don&#x27;t have any real need for unions. Some companies have internalised the functions of the worst unions and are engaged in an asset-stripping operation.<p>There is a tendency for older unions to be worse than newer ones. Setting up a union will almost certainly be good for the people who set it up. Joining an established union may or may not be good for you; if you&#x27;re thinking about joining a union then research <i>this</i> union carefully and figure out if they&#x27;re going to be good for you. Keep in mind that bad unions tend to be extremely political and will be surrounded by propaganda - look for clear evidence of outcomes.<p>If you&#x27;re thinking about unionising in your workplace, please think carefully about this problem and how you&#x27;re going to make sure that your union is one of the good ones.

It didn&#x27;t work.<p>--------<p>... You would be willing to trust what you put into your body to Consumer Reports?  A magazine where, for a small fee, you can buy a positive review?<p>Your argument would be sound if, and only if, we could assume that the public would or could be fully informed as to the validity / accuracy of the various services that would pop up to replace the FDA.<p>Instead what would happen is the various services would simply find it more profitable to pend good reviews most of the time, just enough to be seen as good or slightly better than their peers for their particular advertising demographic.  All of their peers, of course, would also take money to buy good reviews, so no single agency, or group of agencies could be trust worthy for any real amount of the time.<p>And while the FDA may fall into some similar traps as the above, the biggest difference would be that the FDA, by being seperate from the marketplace, has only its reputation and fear of its wrath to keep its value and budget.  By contrast, the free market agencies that would pop up would have as a primary tool the ability to use advertising and marketing to ensure that even if their service is completely illegitimate, a portion of the marketplace would be convinced of its validity, because customers are not 100% knowledgeable on every matter.<p>And the best part, why would any of these agencies ever spend research money on their products?  Sure, enough for the marketing to sound legitimate, perhaps, but not enough to thoroughly test their products, that could only shrink out number of corporate clients.  So you can say goodbye to any science that might have come from agencies like the FDA actually conducting investigations.<p>So in short, all you would have created is a group of competing standards, non of which would have their customer&#x27;s health as a primary concern, all actively advertising potential poisons to consumers, while simultaneously hurting agricultural research.",1398826709

There is great value to the relationship between a pet and its owner during both feeding and training.

I don&#x27;t believe it is true.&quot;<p>This is one central premise of TDD and is not proven or disproven yet.  What we can say is that previous software methodologies were lacking, and cannot prove or disprove their superiority over TDD with regards to this statement.  If you distill all debates about TDD down to their essence, it revolves around this premise.<p>I am fine with someone being skeptical of this claim, but I would prefer if they offered A) a measure we can use to test this hypothesis and B) a contrasting methodology that performs better with regards to the measurements provided in A.  The single biggest outstanding problem in software engineering is finding a metric by which we can judge software quality objectively.  Because it is such an elusive goal other less precise proxies for software quality have been proposed to stand in for the more complex metric.  TDD hangs it&#x27;s shingle on &quot;testability&quot;.  Even though this has obvious defects, I&#x27;ve seen no evidence for any other objective measure as a more precise indicator of software quality and quite a few advantages to &quot;testability&quot;.  Namely, it is measurable.<p>&quot;Why do you think so many of us feel that it is an ideology? Are we seeing ghosts and imagining the whole thing?&quot;<p>No, I&#x27;m sure that you have encountered well meaning but flawed practitioners of TDD.  Your skepticism of their process doesn&#x27;t bother me.  What bothers me is your (and DHH&#x27;s) painting of all TDD folks as cultists. I don&#x27;t believe this stuff because Uncle Bob told me to believe it.  I believe it because my experience shows that rigorous use of TDD practices trend toward better software than a lack of rigor outside of an objective measure for software quality.<p>If you have an alternate rigorous approach that you believe trends (or better yet is provably) better in software quality, by all means outline it.  I know that TDD is flawed and am happy to find its successor.<p>Let me ask you this, prior to the rise of TDD, how prevalent do you think automated testing was?  If it was very prevalent why is it only after the rise of TDD that automated testing became a central part of any build workflow and the entire concept of Continuous Integration/Deployment developed?<p>In my experience, automated testing prior to the rise of TDD was not wide spread.  But maybe I was seeing ghosts and imagining that.",1398826456

Those people would be willing to pay a small price to ensure that what they eat is not poison. Without the FDA, there would probably be numerous entities that evaluate food products and place their mark of approval on those products that pass a rigorous set of tests. Consumers that care about food quality will be willing to spend more to buy food with that mark of approval. If the company approves too many bad products, they lose reputation and go out of business.<p>In fact, there are already organizations that test the quality of products, like Consumer Reports.

7671315,comment,7659524,7665240,1,0,brc,,,">I will never understand why people think insurance companies will be a barrier to adoption. Insurance companies are going to love this. I think the tipping point will be when insurance rates on driving your own car skyrocket.<p>Yes.  The logic goes like this. &#x27;Currently I&#x27;m an insured driver&#x27;.  I will have a car with no driver.  It therefore cannot be insured.<p>Where I live cars are <i>already</i> insured for third-party personal damages, regardless of who is driving them.  It&#x27;s a fixed-cost premium attached and paid at vehicle registration time.  Thus, if you are injured in a motor vehicle accident, regardless of who is at fault, you (or your heirs) will be paid compensation in a regulated environment.  This is a functioning market which doesn&#x27;t adjust for driver age or experience, but instead collectively insures all vehicles on the road, and pays out when a claim is made.  Periodically, when more than one insurer is involved, they will negotiate an &#x27;at fault&#x27; percentage in order to work out which ratio at which the claims are attributed to each insurer.  This may involve discussion of the drivers actions (to determine fault), but the payout is always made - because the <i>vehicle itself</i> is the thing that is insured.<p>In this system, the only way the driver can become liable for the claim is if they specifically and deliberately engaged in a criminal act, such as driving an unregistered vehicle, or driving under influence.  Mere speeding or red-light running doesn&#x27;t void the insurance (as these are traffic infringements rather than criminal acts).  And in these cases, the insurance company still pays out the compensation, but may proceed to recover the compensation from the driver that broke the law.<p>This type of system would easily be translated to driverless vehicles.  The owner of the vehicle would pay a registration fee, and a portion of that fee would be passed onto the owners choice of insurer (or a valid certificate of insurance would need to be presented for registration, which is the same thing).  As long as the insurance was paid, then third-party personal and property damage would be paid out to any accident claimants.  If the insurance company then decided someone was directly liable for causing the claim (such as tampering with vehicle systems or negligent coding) then they could recover the claim money.<p>Such a system would be a vast improvement on the current situation, whereby it&#x27;s the driver that is insured, and because of the various risk factors, insurance premiums are all over the place.  As a result, the riskiest drivers also tend to be the ones lacking insurance, which is the worst case for someone who needs to make a claim.<p>But then insurance is one of the most misunderstood products around, so I guess it&#x27;s not surprising that ignorance of how it works abounds.",1398826169

Who wants to give to their infant son or daughter to later monitor and find out if they&#x27;ll get cancer by the time their are 5 or not... Because the thing is, you don&#x27;t get a do-over like you do with other things. &quot;Oh the program segfaulted. Darn,..., fix bug, recompile and restart&quot;.<p>Those are a few of the reasons. So as the article points out people try to figure out it on their own and kind of feel around in the dark. Facebook groups. Friend of a friend found out about this new superfood item or something. Or I read on Facebook that pickles have lead in them. Whole Foods type place and other &quot;health&quot; food places take advantage of this fear and uncertainty. Others make fun that. Gee so and so is such a hippie eating sprouted beans or thinking GMOs are going to kill you. They don&#x27;t know science, haha! The other side is making fun of those that don&#x27;t eat organic hand massaged free range cows and how they are poisoning their kids with pesticides.<p>There are those who want to live the libertarian dream. Just abolish the FDA and let everyone go shopping with a radiological, chemical and bacteriological assay kit. Gee I would buy this cabbage but my portable DNA sequencer shows its DNA structures has been modified and it has been spliced with a DNA of a frog. I am afraid, I&#x27;ll have to find another seller.  Funny thing is -- these places exist. Just go to any poor country where government regulation is even more non-existent.

They&#x27;re also the oldest consonances, described supposedly by Pythagoras but extant in the Euclidean &quot;Sectio canonis&quot; (~3rd C. BCE).<p>The other intervals weren&#x27;t considered consonant until much later (the middle ages), and didn&#x27;t get their &quot;major/minor&quot; names until a bit later, in the Renaissance. Before this, they were known by their Latin names (M3 = ditone, m3 = semiditone, and so on). The m2 was found in (at least) two forms until the advent of equal temperament, usually known as the major and minor semitones.<p>The &quot;major&quot; intervals are those found in the major scale (M2, M3, M6, M7). The minor intervals aren&#x27;t named in relation to the minor scale, but rather in relation to their major equivalents (a minor second is lower than a major second). &quot;Minor&quot; comes from &quot;molle,&quot; which is &quot;soft&quot;: the major third is &quot;softened&quot; to become the minor third, and so on.",1398823282

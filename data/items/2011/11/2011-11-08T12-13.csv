It's not someone else processing the data, it's you getting around the topic ins and outs.<p>Here is a long story if you want to know how I discovered this method.<p>When I was young (12 year old), I usually go to school to learn things. The process is simple. You start from the basics and you build upon this knowledge. In the end of the trimester, you accumulate knowledge which is pretty much limited to what teachers taught you. This is because you (I) don't go and read books or articles.<p>This knowledge quickly evaporates. I usually find myself learning and learning the same stuff again and reviewing it every-time I have an exam. It went like that and I succeeded every year.<p>When I was 17, I noticed an interesting fact: I'm quite good at programming. I have been doing it since 10 and reading anything that just comes in my way. Article about programming? Just read and think about it, discuss it on communities, read comments and contribute to coding forums.<p>Why I'm better/different than the other guys? Simply: I have a wider and deeper knowledge. When I read a programming book about Ruby On Rails, it doesn't take 30 days to write my first program. I can do it from the first hour. This is because I already know how to install a program, what a server is, what a HTTP request is, and have a good coding knowledge.<p>What you are doing is exactly this: You are broadening your spectrum of knowledge about that particular topic so when you read the said book, you get the gist out of it quickly and easily. No one/thing is doing the work for you, you are just using a different method.<p>For me, and the reason why I use this is because the book/resources are quite boring to read. They don't also cover lot of topics that I don't know about and reading them will make the topic feel like quite difficult to master and understand.",1320757194

So to make a big difference you essentially have to attract developers who would otherwise not be looking for a job.<p>StackOverflow does this through it's stack exchange sites where they have a captive audience, CoderStack does this through a huge amount of advertising and marketing (we've bought roughly 30 million ad impressions this year - that's about 90 impressions for every developer in the UK).<p>You need to ask yourself what is it that you're going to do differently that will allow you to attract these developers.<p>If I was building something in this space from scratch I'd be much more inclined to go the route someone else suggested in this thread of the daily deal email route, because that is a feasible way of tackling the attracting passive developer problem.",1320757044

    How is it not scaling for you?
</code></pre>
On scaling it is tedious because things we take for granted are suddenly hard. Some example of that, but not limited to:<p>---<p>The transactional support in GAE is really awful. Something which I take for granted when working in Django or Rails with a RDBMS: I want the writes I did to be reverted in case my request failed for some stupid reason and triggers an exception. It's nothing much, but I want this basic functionality that should be a no-brainer.<p>Transactions in GAE work on trees. Basically GAE puts a lock on a parent entity (every entity can have a parent entity) and every operation done on an entity with that parent will be inside the transaction (and reverted in case of rollback). But THE PROBLEM is that you cannot abuse this functionality, because once a lock is made on parent, the whole tree is completely blocked. Which means that concurrent requests to the same entities from another request will wait until the transaction holding the lock finishes, with a freaking timeout and an exception if it fails.<p>Even SQLite is smarter than that. Programming like it's freaking 1970.<p>---<p>Even on GAE you do have to keep a normalized copy of your data, unless your data is really dumb. That's because you do not know the kind of queries you will do in advance and it is better to have a single-source of truth that is normalized and then build views asynchronously around that for whatever queries you want ... but in doing so, adding a single dumb view to your app is a huge PITA.<p>And even denormalization is a problem, because surely you can store the comments on an article for a stupid blog in a single entity as a list, or tags, or whatever, but then GAE places hard limits on the amount of data stored in a single entity (1 MB or something). Every step of the way you'll have to think about the query you want and about how big your dataset is. You just can't throw the data in there and optimize it later.<p>In case of MySQL missing an index your app will just be slower. But in case of GAE, it won't run.<p>---<p>Many simple queries become really complex, like in case you want to do a radius search, for which with MYSQL you can just do a stupid haversine-based search like <i>lat BETWEEN (LatX, LatY) AND lon BETWEEN (LonX, LonY)</i>, but this is not possible to optimize on GAE and instead have to go and experiment with bounding box searches.<p>And even if you have a perfectly optimizeable query, GAE places hard limits on what you can retrieve. For example you can retrieve only the first 5000 items of a dataset (that number is up from 1000 last time I tried it). This is again problematic -- with MySQL sometimes I want the first 20000 items and it isn't a problem. What if you want to update all items in an entity somehow? What if you want not the first 5000 items in an index, but the last 5000, something which isn't a problem with a classical RDBMS? Yeah, you have to do special gymnastics.<p>Go ahead and try building a classic admin, like the one Django provides, in which you have a paginated view of all the data you have in a single table, with filters applicable and ordering on any column you want. Something that is trivial in a classical environment will suck your soul out until your eyes will bleed.<p>---<p>GAE puts hard limits on the amount of time allocated for each request or background task. And surely they raised those limits but it is not enough.<p>The fact of the matter is that you have absolutely no guarantee that processing from 1 to X items from the datastore will succeed in the time allocated. When I had to solve this, a background task sometimes processed 500 entities in a row, sometimes it managed to process only 10, sometimes it managed to process only 5 -- I shit you not. That's because the time GAE spends on other tasks like waking up an instance, initializing your framework and other things is factored in. Not only that but the datastore can have a really high latency, which is a problem GAE users have been bitching about since GAE was launched.<p>And so you have to do your own book-keeping of where you left off and whether the processing of an item succeeded and it case it didn't you have to revert and start again (developing your own transactions mechanism that can rollback changes after the fact, like with the Memento pattern or shit like that -- again, like it is freaking 1970).<p>---<p>GAE puts hard limits on what you can actually do with it. The apis are severily restricted.<p>If your app does anything interesting, other than (1) serving content from the datastore, (2) fetches content from an external URL (but good luck doing crawling, hope you have enough money), (3) makes thumbnails of images, (4) sends emails but only using the <i>special</i> API as you can't do SMTP or (5) sends XMPP messages using their <i>special</i> API, then you're shit out of luck.<p>And it's also a problem offloading whatever you can't do on your own Linux instance. That's because the datastore has severe limits on the number of requests you make or on the amount of data transfered and if you're going through hundreds of thousands of entities, which is really not that many, updating them with fresh content from an external instance, then you need to prepare yourself for a really fat monthly bill.",1320754422

3210406,comment,3209385,3209385,36,0,nadam,,,"I liked these essays when I was young, because these were so encouraging. It treated us programmers as special snow flakes, and advertised us the romantic super exciting world of startups.
Now as I got older and more experienced I find these essays trivial, boring or simply not true.
I realized I no longer gain anything 'usable' for my life from such essays.
(I find less and less interesting most essays from Joel and others also. I am more and more interested in actual business opportunities and connections,  and less and less interested in general essays about enterpreneurship and programming.)<p>Creating wealth is relatively easy, but I don't care about it anymore (except as a hobby), I care about creating money, which is much harder.
All the stuff about programmer productivity in this essay is first not true but more importantly not really important anymore in my opinion.
At most startups and big companies programming is a commodity. By 2011 we programers are good enough, programming became matrue enough that it is really a commodity now. Not a cheap commodity, but a commodity: a $100.000 per year commodity. I argue that in 2011 (maybe not in 2004) you can find really good people for $100.000 per year if you know how to find these people. You can find much cheaper in Eastern Europe (where I live) if you are not so snob that you think programmers in the West are so special. So unless you work on something very deeply technical or technicall revolutionary (so you are not John Carmack working on the fastest rendering engine on the planet or you are not the engineer behind Gogle's superfast javascript engine) your value as a programmer is someting like $100.000 or something. There is no '36x multiplier because of programmer productivity.' I think if the market is quasy efficient that means if your startup would be about programming then the expected value of your earnings would be sometinng like this value ($100.000) in your startup. 
What kind of multipliers there really are:<p>- There can be a multiplier because of your idea, your product, your marketing, and your connections. But not programming (in case of not technically deep startups. Technically deep startups are quite rare.)
- There is a factor which is related to how popular it is to create a startup. If it is super popular because of marketing essays like this, then it is possible that there are too much startups of constant sized markets, so that your expected value of earning could be even less than $100.000. At the time of this essay, when starting-up was not that popular we could not really speak of saturated markets, so that your expected value of earning was probably more than $100.000. The more people start-up the less attractive it will be to start-up. So the more successful PG's essays will be the less true they will be.",1320754095

All the money that was in Gox that was going to get out already did. The rest is already deflated from the death of confidence in Gox. All the rest of the money is going into a black hole of whatever the US fed got and whatever MtGox dies with.<p>Unless people start panic selling their coins on the other exchanges (which I don&#x27;t even get why you would - Gox is dead, the greatest blemish of incompetence in the trading scene is no more, that is a good thing), I don&#x27;t see how this would impact the general btc price any more. If anything, I&#x27;d hope it would rally, but that malleable transactions nonsense probably is going to keep people scared for a while.",1393300798

I said that I could already read as fast as I could think, and he rolled his eyes and said, &quot;You people who think.&quot; I believe that this skill might be useful to some people, but I prefer to avoid reading things that could profitably be speed read, because life is too short for that.

7295384,comment,7293512,7295215,5,0,colmmacc,,,"The problem doesn&#x27;t have much to do with particular mail servers, but rather with the order in which queries may be made. Let&#x27;s say the following two records are allowed to co-exist:<p><pre><code>    example.com 60 IN MX mail.example.com\n    example.com 60 IN CNAME foo.example.org\n</code></pre>\nand that the MX record takes precedence over the CNAME when queried. Imagine a client, C, behind resolver R, and it makes the following queries;<p><pre><code>    1. C looks up qname=example.com qtype=MX, R returns the MX record\n    2. C Looks up qname=example.com qtype=A, R follows the CNAME\n    3. C looks up qname=example.com qtype=MX, R follows the CNAME\n</code></pre>\nThe resolver will first resolve the MX record, and cache that correctly, passing the result back to the client. The second query though will result in a CNAME, which will likely invalidate the cached MX record, and the resolver will then follow the CNAME and chase that. The third query may now also follow the CNAME, even though there may not be an MX record at the CNAME target (foo.example.org).<p>Any non-MX query behind resolver R effectively poisons R&#x27;s cache, and the MX becomes unreachable. If R gets no queries other than MX queries, or if the MX and CNAME target answers are cacheable for identical periods of time, then it can sometimes work - but it&#x27;s a tenuous and non-deterministic stroke of luck. If there&#x27;s even one lookup behind R - from any of its clients for a non-MX, things break again. Some mail servers do perform an A lookup before an MX lookup (which is valid RFC822) and so things never work for those mail servers, as they always poison the cache, but that correlation isn&#x27;t really the cause of the problem. The configuration is unreliable even in the best of circumstances.<p>Full disclosure: I work on Route 53.",1393300715

Then I reread it again :)<p>Conversely, a lot of fiction, especially fiction on the lighter side, tends to repeat itself, or provide more narrative clues as to what&#x27;s going on, so you can usually pick up what you missed in the context.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s a really high level recollection of something I&#x27;m not an expert in :P<p>I also might just be trying to convince myself that I&#x27;m not a slow reader, heh<p>If anyone has any research or info to the contrary, I&#x27;d love to hear about it, because I&#x27;d definitely like to be able to absorb meaningful/dense information more quickly, even if it were just a small percent increase.<p>I&#x27;d also really like to see some third party research/tests with stuff like this and spreeder",1393300582

I know of games that with all the localization had over 40,000 dialog audio files (yes, that&#x27;s four zero k).<p><i>Content First</i> doesn&#x27;t work on big projects IMO. In fact with &quot;agile&quot; you won&#x27;t even know what content you need until you get there.<p>That said, with a little forethought it would certainly be possible to try to design some system so you could at least kind of auto verify that at least all your placeholder stuff has been replaced with something not placeholder. For example if you prefixed all placeholder text with &quot;PLACEHOLDER: &quot; and then had a script that would check. Could probably do similar things for audio files though it might be a little harder.<p>Unfortunately for people adding new text or audio if they forgot to follow the rules you&#x27;d have a hole.

In this respect, central bank money-printing and the speculative bubbles it creates can be seen to be both deflationary (i.e., creates unemployment and puts downward pressure on wages) and inflationary (i.e., creates shortages and higher prices for consumer goods as well as higher prices for speculative assets) at the same time.",1393298530

This is known as a &quot;collective action problem&quot; - where any individual may benefit if they defect, but each individual benefits more if everyone cooperates than if everyone defects.<p>How about a toy example:<p>Say we&#x27;re living in a small coastal village, and storm season is approaching.  If we don&#x27;t build a levee, we&#x27;re all going to lose a lot more - in total - than the cost of building the levee.  But the levee is expensive (more than we can collectively come up with up front) and will take a long time to build (we don&#x27;t have time to save, before we need to start construction).  So we all agree to pay monthly.  Come the second month, I&#x27;m thinking &quot;Well, I want the levee built, but the value <i>my portion</i> of the funds adds to the levee really isn&#x27;t worth as much to me as the funds themselves...&quot;  If the choice is &quot;Everyone pays or no one pays&quot; I clearly prefer &quot;everyone pays&quot;.  I prefer &quot;everyone but me pays&quot; even more, but everyone else is only going to pay if we all credibly commit to paying, which means we commit to be forced if we later decide we don&#x27;t want to pay.",1393298011

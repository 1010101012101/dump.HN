8286224,comment,8285744,8285744,10,0,smacktoward,,,"Two thoughts:<p>1) You&#x27;re absolutely right that writing extensions for Firefox is harder than writing extensions for Chrome. But that&#x27;s in no small part because Firefox has been around for something like twice as long as Chrome has; and really, Firefox&#x27;s add-on infrastructure goes back even further, all the way back to the original Mozilla suite. Which means Firefox is carting around something like 15+ years&#x27; worth of legacy infrastructure with it. There are lots of bits of technology that Made Sense At The Time™ (XUL and RDF manifests, for instance) that just seem needlessly baroque today.<p>It&#x27;s possible to imagine them ripping all that out and starting from a clean sheet of paper, but that wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be an unalloyed good for developers. After all, backwards compatibility is a Good Thing for developers too; just for developers who have already gotten into the platform, rather than those seeking to get in now.<p>Rather than have a Great Break and throw out all those years&#x27; worth of extension developers&#x27; work, Mozilla has instead been making incremental improvements to extension development -- creating things like bootstrapped extensions (<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Bootstrapped_extensions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Bootstrapped_ext...</a>) and reducing the dependency on things like RDF that nobody wants to work with anymore. This is a pragmatic approach, but it will require a very long time for it to get Firefox to a place where it can compete directly with Chrome on this front.<p>Which leads me to point 2...<p>2) Imagine that Firefox <i>didn&#x27;t</i> have to worry about all that legacy support, and really could start from a clean sheet of paper.<p>Would it be worth it?<p>My personal sense is that browser extensions <i>in general</i> are a technology that&#x27;s on the far side of the adoption bell curve. As the Web itself becomes a more capable platform, many scenarios that used to require an extension can now be handled quite well by sites on their own. And anecdotally, I see a lot less interest in extensions among the &quot;normal users&quot; I interact with these days than I did, say, 10 years ago.<p>So, if you&#x27;re Mozilla, maybe you <i>could</i> make extension development cleaner, but it&#x27;s just not worth the effort to do so. Why plow developer time into improving something that few people care about today and fewer will care about tomorrow? Maybe it&#x27;s best to just remove the most obnoxious problems by tweaking around the edges, and let time take care of the rest.<p>Which, come to think of it, sounds a lot like what they are already doing...",1410199165

Most other accelerators are smaller with class sizes around 10. If YC is shooting for 40, and gets 37, it&#x27;s maybe not a huge deal (8% under target). You could even make 42 or 44 offers and plan for a certain acceptance rate, end up with 44 probably isn&#x27;t the end of the world (110% capacity).<p>If another is shooting for 10 and gets 7, that&#x27;s a 30% drop which is probably enough to mess with the economics of the accelerator. Similarly, if they make 12 offers planning for a certain acceptance rate and end up with all 12, they&#x27;re at 120% capacity, which also might be enough to mess with the economics.<p>I still think exploding offers suck, but YC is in a much stronger position to be relaxed about them than others.",1410199141

The trajectory is not periodic, ie. it doesn&#x27;t repeat more than once.

8286194,comment,8285744,8285744,19,0,sroussey,,,"Five years ago or so, you could debug extensions with Chromebug, based on Firebug. It is what we used to debug Firebug itself. But when Mozilla decided to go and split out its own DevTools about three years ago, the writing was on the wall, and the lead developer John left. Unfortunately, he was the only one that really understood Chromebug, and Mozilla kept changing things that broke it with each new version of Firefox.<p>If you think debugging your extension is hard, imagine debugging Firebug. We built our own tracing/logging extension a long time ago to help, and I think it predates Chromebug. But it is not the same.<p>Fact is, Mozilla extensions are going to have some issues when e10s ships in final form. It can give then the opportunity to redo things. I&#x27;m not a fan of JetPack, btw, as I think python is a requirement. And not the version I have on my machine. Talk about a non-starter.<p>At least the built in tools are finally getting to a useable state. They are made for e10s. They have some nice features. I haven&#x27;t noticed them breaking sites that you debug by being them being turned on (my fault for waiting so long to file a bug). They have some great UI choices (yet some bad ones).

Also, ag prints line numbers by default, which can be an expensive operation on larger files.<p>I think most of the slowdown you&#x27;re seeing with &quot;find -exec | cat&quot; is forking at least two processes (ag and cat) for each file. Also, each process has to be run sequentially (to prevent garbled output), which makes use of only one CPU core most of the time. I&#x27;ve tried to keep ag&#x27;s startup time fast so that classic find-style commands still run quickly. (This is why ag doesn&#x27;t support a ~/.agrc or similar.)<p>Just FYI, you can use ag --stat to see how many files/bytes were searched, how long it took, etc. I think I&#x27;ll add some stats about obeying ignore rules, since some of those can be outright pathological in terms of runtime cost.

8286044,comment,8282124,8285434,3,0,616c,,,"(Part 3)<p>> - No school of Islam has emerged that takes back on these opinions. The best of enlightenment you get is people claiming that people should get a second chance, but thought crime still leads to death.<p>There are five schools of Islam (technically speaking, there are four, until the Jafriyyah School of Shi&#x27;a Islam, as recognized by the prominent scholars and figures in the Sunni schools in modern history quite late at a date I do not recall, which is an interesting political gesture by itself).  I am not sure what you are referring to, but if it is bida&#x27;a, I somehow doubt that they have a consistent view on this.  They are all hundreds of years old, and specializing in one of them is an academic lifetime all to itself.  I assume some, probably the Hanbalist as you guessed from earlier, would demand death. The others, probably not.  But I cannot be sure and that ironically is not easy to research in a short period (I just tried, haha).  But rest assured you have a point: there orthodox bigots in Islam, just like fudamnetalist Christians and hardcore Orthodox Jews.<p>> Because of these issues, mainstream Islamic thinking is less open to deviating opinion, critical thinking, sensitivities, or at least the open discussion of topics. These issues make it easier to justify totalitarianism or elements thereof in an Islamic context. There is no &quot;Reformed Judaism&quot; version of Islam that is openly and widely practiced. And that appears to be a burden for every Muslim who wants to be a critical thinker and wants to build a society on freedom and progress.<p>Maybe in the sense they do not have a name.  But there are many progressive Islamic scholars (I use that term as someone specializing in religion, not any academic of Muslim background).  Tariq Ramadan comes to mind (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariq_Ramadan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariq_Ramadan</a>), and he is very well-known in MENA and out.  There are others as well. The difference is Islam, because of perceived attack, encourages believers to emphasize unity and not discuss differences.  The schools of Islamic law you mention are academic mainly, and any believer would not be concerned as it barely impacts their belief or praxis.  In terms of practice, the only real dividie is between Sunni and Shi&#x27;a, and almost people when question about which one they are get cagey and will tell you they are Muslim, for the reasons they described.  You are not supposed to make the difference between you and others a big issue.  Only zealots, for political reasons, encourage this crap and you see the civil war it causes in Iraq and Lebanon.  Many open people talk about it, but largely in Arabic, and I suppose you do not know it.<p>This has been a cool discussion though. I am sorry if you think I am ignoring your comments are being insulting in my dealing with you, but I am glad someone questions and asks.

But I am sure we are not going to enjoy where this is going.<p>> First up: do not interpret what I&#x27;m saying next as any sort of defence of Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism or Hinduism. Religion is a bad place to start building a society from in the first place. I&#x27;ll limit my commentary to mainstream religions as they tend not to affect geopolitics.<p>Haha.  So Christianity Judaism Islam Buddhism and Hinduism do not cause geopolitical issues?  I point to the Middle East (Judaism and Islam: Palestinian conflict is unavoidable in any issue of any size in geopolitical negotations in the region, and has been so since the 50&#x27;s), South Asia (Islam and Hinduism, specifcally Kashmir, beyond the whole Parition and Pakistan-Indian aggression at large since the partition), Buddhism (Japan, Aum Shinrikyo for specific example, but I will admit Buddhism has far fewer occurrences and I have always been intrigued if there is a really observable reason as to why beyond my bias, I am sure someone here has better examples) off the top of my head.  Do you know of any place where religion is no co-opted that does not cause geo-political instability?  Because, again, I believe that is the shitty nature of hunanity rearing its ugly head.<p>> Islam does a worse job of building an effective critical-thinking society than other mainstream religions. Some things that are uniquely combined Islam are the following:<p>That is not Islam, that is the respective governance and culture of the regions where Islam is the majority faith.  I can go into the history of the regions, specifically the Middle East (you do remember the Wikipedia article that this discussion is tied to, yes?) but the &quot;Islamic Empire&quot; (and I mean when it defined itself as a such, during the Ummayad, Abbasid, etc. Caliphates) saw great strides in intellectual development.  The bulk of education you likely received is built on critical thinking you honed through Phillenic knowledge inherited and improved upon by Caliphate&#x27;s acquisition and funding of foreign scholarship and translation.  But, I digress.<p>> - Islam has a text that is the literal word of God; not &quot;words inspired&quot; by God as is the case in many others. Since the word is taken to be literal, it is easier to commit apostasy as it is more difficult to hide behind interpretation.<p>This is not a definitive thing.  As a matter of fact, the reactionary nature of post-modern Muslim socieities is rooted in rediscovering the people (Hanbalis) who followed Ibn Hanbal, the guy who asserted it was the direct word of  \nGod, and that reasoning about it or analyzing theologically was heresy.  The other view, that of 3lm-al Kalam, Science of Discourse (notice the name) were the dominant camp supported by the Abbasid Caliphs when he came to being.  Hanbal and company were able to find themselves politically convenient and then removed any Kalamist opposition.<p>I will let you guess what happened to the Kalamists politically and socially over time as they were targeted by the politically expedient Hanbalists?  As you might guess from my opinions of religion and politics mixing, this was detrimental and lead to serious decay in Kalamist and Mutazlite scholarship on Islam.<p>This is historical, of course.  You will say it does not matter.  My point is that this is a majority view, and was not always.  Political circumstances allowed people in power to change the popular view in religion and then interpretations changed and you see the reactionary Islam you are familiar with in the Gulf and with nutjobs in Iraq and Syria.  That is a problem.  It was not always that way, and I hope this brief history analysis will clear some of that up.  If you do not care for it, it is ok.  But you should read about the Hanbalis and Kalamists if you want to know what happens when politics controls intellectual endeavor.  Spolier alert: it is a sad read.<p>> - The penalty for deviating thought is death in all schools of Islam. Other holy texts also claim this, but certainly not all schools of other religions claim the same.<p>Do you mean bid&#x27;a when you say deviation?  Deviation from what?  These terms were not made concrete way outside the scope of the Quran and this is all based on socio-political developments that are far more about Arab and Turkish history than specifically with the religion.<p>Again, you need to read the texts.  The Quran, the one that matters, does not mention the word from a quick search.  Also Wikipedia (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bid%E2%80%98ah"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bid%E2%80%98ah</a>) has a citation needed point on the page of this concept in Islam, but no citation in the Quran can be offerred.  With any treatise on Islam, no quote to the Quran = dead end.  I would not even read it, personally, as I know the source is iffy at best.  I understand if that is not good enough for you, but this socio-political manipulation of the religion at its best.  Bidah was ued to shut people up, and it worked.  This is not only a universal thing, Wikipeda also hints that no one group can agree on what it is, what it means, and how to handle it.",1410197512

You have great talent for making arrogance and ad hominems sound polite and subtle, which is something I can strangely appreciate in a twisted sense. Well played.<p>Ok, I am not trying to play you, but I have to be honest, I do not see how you find so much offense with my general tone here.  You flat out called me rude the first time around.  I would usually not engage in such games, but I think it is fair to talk to you because you are putting a lot of time or effort into this.  I do not think I have attacked you, but I guess I am coming up much ruder than you meant.  So, ok.  Sorry.  I would rather take this as a good conversation, instead of turning it into a flame.<p>> There are many with that capability. The quintessential one is Kantian ethics. One other method I will mention simply because I happen to have read it recently, is outlined in &quot;The Moral Landscape&quot; by Sam Harris.<p>I think maybe I was confusing in what I mean.  I think anyone, Kant or otherwise, can go around saying religion X or Y is right or wrong, or any elements of belief structures independent of that structure.  That does not make it empirical, scientific, or rational.  There will never be a mathematical proof that God exists, there is a heaven, that the rape is bad, usury is bad, etc.  Should I stop being ethical in light of my belief there is mathematical proof for religion?  No.  But I notice you refer to ethics.  I am not interested in ethics when discussing this topic.  I mean beliefs, ideas, and religious prescriptions.  I mean proving scienfically whether or not sleeping with another man&#x27;s wife is the will of God or not?  I understand I can reason about this, but I am putting a higher burden on myself (when thinking of reason) than &quot;because it is bad.&quot;  Even addition requires a proof in mathematics, and that is rigorous and difficult.  Some people claim they have done so, but I do not see this as reason or rationality or whatever they call it.  You can believe if you choose; that is OK.  But I do not think ethicists are scientists with a rigorous scientific platform.  That is why it is philosophy, and philosophy and theology are not part of the sciences.  They work differently, and I oppose in Western history the Divine Watchmaker Theory (creation is so perfect, like a well-constructed watch, so there must a divine being, the Watchmaker/God, who created it) like I am disgusted by people who have told me years ago, before I even was interested in Islam, that the Quran refers to certain scientific facts well-established now that were certainly yet to be determined by contemporary science and therefore the book is divined from God. I think Kant might be more advanced with his proof of God (I studied it in college stateside years ago, and I do not remember it so well), but there is something silly about the whole process.  There is no science or rationality to faith, why must me prove it exists with rationality or scientific analysis?  You seem to be insulted by this notion, but that is just my opinion I suppose.  I thought it was more common, but when I was taught about proofs of God (ironically I went to a Catholic university that taught a whole freshmen seminar on the topic called Problem of God), I thought I was not in the minority to see such endeavors as well-intentioned but pointless.  Maybe I am out of touch.  I do not mean to offend you, but I guess I misunderstood my position is not common like I believed it to be.<p>> I did not claim that the whole of Muslim society wants this, and I find it insulting that you put those words in my mouth. I was pointing out that opinions on upturning society are an important opinion in Muslim (sub)societies, as evidenced by opinion polls [1].<p>Yes, it is important.  But that is my point.  A radical minority opinion should represent the whole faith?  I am not intending to put words in your mouth, but I rountinely encounter people, in the US and elsewhere like expats who live in the MENA region, that believe everyone thinks this.  Not everyone does.  Ironically, I live in a country in the Gulf that is one of the few that tries to put this into practice.  Maybe the local community, ironically greatly outnumbered by Muslim and non-Muslim expat population that holds the country together, routinely complain about and disapprove of it.  That is anecdote.  But to me, polling information shows me people talk about, and some want it.  Is all of America murderous because some of them support the dealth penalty?  I know you, by now, are pretty clear you dislike my analogies.  But drawing these kinds of lines is not reason with me.",1410197353

For example, testing a new mail server, a client website, etc. Most systems will show an alert, and many just refuse to work entirely (e.g. SMTP relaying) without a significant amount of configuration change (which then has to be undone later).<p>But isn&#x27;t that better than nothing? Even if my blog has a self-signed certificate and you can&#x27;t say for sure that &#x27;this blog is run by so-and-so&#x27;, isn&#x27;t that better than a wholly unencrypted connection? SSL seems to be used for two purposes, namely encrypted connections and validating the remote server, but surely encrypted connections alone are a sufficient benefit? And yet, if all I want to do is have a secure channel, I have to (theoretically) pay a certificate issuer yearly to prove that I am who I am, as if encryption requires I prove my identity.<p>It would make a great deal more sense to me to treat self-signed certificates the same way we treat HTTP sites: give no notification to the user whatsoever, unless they go looking for it. Browsers could also have a &#x27;strict mode&#x27; enforcing the current behaviour (require authentication) for environments or users which prefer it.<p>The major problem I see here is that sites where you <i>do</i> want to guarantee certificates (e.g. Facebook.com, google.com, bank of america, etc) would be difficult to guarantee that you were connecting to the correct site, since MITM attacks against your SSL connection would be treated like HTTP connections and the browser would let them proceed as if nothing was wrong.

Third, have you gone through all the verses personally in the Quran that &quot;define&quot; &quot;God&quot;?<p>Why do you ask me those questions? Why do the answers to them matter? Do you really think anyone believes that the details of Arabic change the interpretation so much that the general meaning of the text changes? Why would I have to go through <i>all</i> the verses <i>personally</i>? It seems one verse of a reasonable translation describing a general contradiction with scientific knowledge would be enough. I mean, if this truly was the literal word of an all-knowing being, a single verse disagreeing with real-world knowledge would bring into question the claimed origin of such a text?<p>> If you haven&#x27;t done these, how can you come to that conclusion.

More robust system performance is likely to arise in systems where operators can discern the “edge of the envelope”.</i><p>This maps interestingly to the work of strategic thinker John Boyd (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boyd_%28military_strategist%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boyd_%28military_strategis...</a>). (I summarized the general thrust of Boyd&#x27;s thought in a blog post here: <a href=""http://jasonlefkowitz.net/2013/03/how-winners-win-john-boyd-and-the-four-qualities-of-victorious-organizations/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jasonlefkowitz.net/2013/03/how-winners-win-john-boyd-...</a>)<p>In analyzing what separates organizations that win victories from those that do not, Boyd wrote of a quality he called <i>Fingerspitzengefühl</i> -- a German word that can be understood as something like &quot;intuition.&quot; (The literal translation of the German word is &quot;fingertip feeling,&quot; as in how a successful baseball pitcher can tell where the ball is going to go solely from how it feels rolling out of his hand.) His point was that winning organizations exposed their people to both training (good) and experience (better!) enough so that they could learn to react to emergent situations on instinct, rather than by consulting a manual or waiting for instructions from above. The point quoted above sounds like a call for people working on complex systems to get opportunities to develop their own <i>Fingerspitzengefühl</i>.<p>Which leads to the thought that maybe a <i>completely</i> failure-free system is not something we should strive for. After all, in a completely failure-free system, nobody would ever get enough experience groping around the edge of the envelope to learn how to intuit where the other edges are. All they&#x27;d have is &quot;here there be Dragons!&quot; warnings from the past, which would become less compelling the farther into the past they come from. People are quick to discount warnings that contrast with their personal experience, and if your experience is that the System never fails, it&#x27;s not hard to imagine people starting to believe that the System <i>cannot</i> fail. Which is fine, until it <i>does</i> fail, and nobody has any idea what to do to fix it.<p>It&#x27;s sort of the same thing that happened to the financial sector in the US. After the Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression, a whole set of legal and institutional safeguards were put in place to prevent those things from happening again. But as time passed and generations grew up that had not experienced those crises directly, people began to decry those safeguards as needless bureaucracy. Eventually enough people did so that most of the safeguards were stripped away; at which point the system promptly collapsed again.",1410196669

GA is indeed far more dangerous than commerical aviation although a well-maintained 30-year old airplane can be perfectly airworthy. We in the skydiving community are used to flying old planes & as long as the maintenance is ok & the airplane has not been pushed too many times outside of its performance envelope everything should be fine.

And you do seem like you're confusing my 'this is how it is' statement with a 'this is how it should be' statement, and getting quite angry about the latter.  I actually agree with you completely - users of a free service shouldn't have any cause to complain about what's in the TOS.<p>But that isn't the way things actually work.  Instead, if your company does something that users don't like - whether they've consented to it in your terms of service or not - the users will react by creating a big public relations nightmare for you, which will ultimately damage the value of your company.

He starts by saying that AGW has the ball, but then carries that on through the rest of  his reasoning as a proxy for ""global temperatures will be 6 degrees higher in 2100 hundred has the ball"", although he doesn't come out and say it.<p>Few educated people disbelieve in the evidence for some AGW. There are a few things that many of us <i>don't</i> believe.<p>We don't believe that there is any reasonable evidence that the magnitude and impact of AGW will be dire. When the IPCC reports come out, there is tons of evidence for weak AGW. But that tons of evidence applies to weak AGW. Each of those studies is evidence for modest claims. It doesn't matter if you accumulate 10 times as many studies supporting those modest claims, it will not be evidence for the incredibly less likely hypotheses that they are made to do work for by the press and politically-motivated scientists.<p>In fact, there's plenty of reason to believe increased temperatures will be a net benefit to humanity. Humanists, but not reactionaries, should be open to this. There is no reason to believe we're currently at our ""ideal temperature"", and there's no reason to freeze our current ecosystems in time as if they're sanctified objects of a disorganized but fervent religion. Regardless, the claim that rising temperatures will leave us worse off isn't remotely proven.<p>The author waves his hands by the ""cost-effective things we can do to mitigate global warming"" as if such a thing exists in the current public debate. Almost every proposal normally under discussion in the public venue have overwhelming costs.[1]<p>This is a costs/benefits judgment, and you can't make that judgement without knowing the benefits. On an episode of Mad Men, Don Draper is standing in the living room with his wife and the interior decorator. His wife asks him what he thinks about the new furniture and its arrangement. He says, ""Well, it's kind of hard to judge without knowing the price."" People seem to forget that.<p>Concerning the benefits, there is no plausible, let alone tested, theory of risk prediction for climate temperatures in 2100. At all. So we're not talking about science here anymore. When you say, well, we can't calculate the risks, but the worst case is the extinction of mankind, you're getting dangerously close to the St. Petersburg paradox. Spreading FUD is a principal mechanism by which con men of all stripes manipulate.<p>[1] Although I'm all for as many nuclear reactors as we can build.

This is the divide: those who've had the ultimate social family tree preserved in a convenient database, and those who go on a road trip to search public records for traces of genealogy. Any effort an oldster takes today to preserve 'who they were' will pale next to a lifetime of crowdsourced social biography.",1266434471

Marco seems to be extolling the virtues of doing nothing in high school instead of explaining why grades are broken or even why not doing schoolwork may be a good decision.<p>Why do people treat not doing schoolwork as being inherently virtuous? The view that the activities required to do well in school are a waste of time(though I believe that it wastes very little time) is valid, and I agree, for the most part. There are also some who believe that the potential benefits of doing well in high school(for example, going to a good university) are not worth the cost. I disagree with them, but if they make a considered decision that attending MIT or Stanford or the like is not worth the opportunity cost of doing well in high school and that their time would be better spent doing something else, then I'd respect their decision and them for giving more thought than most people to the consequences of their actions.<p>However, even in this community that I consider to have noticeably above-average intelligence, I sometimes see people almost boasting of how they did nothing in high school. This is somewhat understandable when they are explaining what they did instead of their schoolwork that was a more useful use of their time, but I simply cannot understand why people will brag solely of their inaction during high school without describing what they did instead. If you don't have something else you did in the time that was a better use of your time, doesn't that mean that you wasted the time even more than if you had done all of the work?",1266434242

This is the approach the author advocates.  I will admit, I had similar thinking when I first started college.  However doing down that road can really limit (although not remove) opportunities later in life that you deserve.  I've seen many extraordinarily intelligent friends get rejected from graduate schools because they took the scorched earth approach towards busywork.<p>Being completely subservient to the system and rejecting it outright are not the only two options you have a student.  Personally I found the most effective method was to maintain a GPA over 3.25 with minimal effort and make my real focus undergraduate research.  This has worked out incredibly well so far. I have a blast doing research because I get to work on intellectually stimulating problems and I only spend the minimum amount of time necessary on busywork for courses.<p>The concrete results in terms of awards and internships has been excellent.  I've never once had an interviewer ask about GPA; it's high enough to be acceptable and is overshadowed by research experience.

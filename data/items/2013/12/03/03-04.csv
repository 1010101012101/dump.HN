6838378,comment,6837148,6837148,5,0,karoramj23,,,"As a restaurant owner, I know this is something that has been coming, we will eventually all use tablets in someway shape or form. I don&#x27;t believe that this company is the one that has cracked tablet use in restaurants because they are not helping me with my most pressing need - driving more customers into the restaurant.<p>These are my thoughts:<p>1) Faster table turn times (and why they don&#x27;t matter) - Yes, faster table turn times will occur with the tablets on the table because people can pay much more quickly when they are done with their meal. The big problem that people forget about is 90% of the time restaurants are not interested in faster table turn times. They need more people in the establishment. When was the last time you went to Applebees and they were slammed with people and had a huge wait? Odd&#x27;s are that it doesn&#x27;t occur that often.<p>2) People Dine out to be treated (waited on hand and foot) - Usually when you have made a conscious decision to dine out, you are doing so for the experience. When you decide to dine at your favorite restaurant, part of the experience is being waited on hand and foot by someone else. If these tablets start to replace people, it will certainly hurt the experience of being waited on. You are now going out for food, and not the experience. When people are looking strictly for food, we have seen that they tend to go to fast-casual restaurants (Chipotle, Potbellys, Noodles & Co. Etc.).<p>3) Menu on tablet (Higher App sales + lower costs) - This to me is a large long-term benefit for the restaurant. They can really create some powerful images for their menu items, which is correlated with higher sales. Also, you have eliminated the costs of printing menus every time you have a change.<p>Overall Impressions: This is a company that has created a product for an interesting niche. I don&#x27;t ever see fine dining establishments using this because it detracts from the experience (#2). It does effect table turn time, but the large majority of restaurants wish they had table turn time issues, most are looking for customers (see initial success of groupon in restaurants). The Applebee&#x27;s of the world are fighting hard with the fast-casual establishments and almost seem like they are in a race to the bottom.<p>I also don&#x27;t see independent restaurant owners ever using a product like this because it has 1) high implementation costs (time/effort/cash) and 2) has some effect on sales but not because of the ordering platform, only because it has allowed me to create essentially a moving slideshow for a menu that entices customers while they are at the restaurant.<p>In my opinion, the person/business that successfully implements tablets in a restaurant will do these two things very well. \n1) Allows servers to use tablets to take orders (lowers restaurants costs) - This will essentially allow a restaurant owner to decrease the amount of people on staff, yet still maintain high quality experience for guests, because a server that does not have to walk back to the POS system can handle more tables.<p>2) Creates a tablet menu that entices guests to order more items - The appeal of tablets on the table is the fact that people will be more enticed to order apps/desserts because of the power of high-quality enticing pictures. This has already been done by plenty of companies, but no one company has dominated.",1386043084

James Risen, AFAIK, entered his current legal situation quite a time after the publishing of his story...and this seems to pretty much always be the case with journalism that ends up on in a courtroom. If the NSA had been using its full wiretapping powers to &quot;inspect&quot; Risen, a well known national affairs reporter, then it would&#x27;ve not gotten to the probe stage, or to the publication stage.<p>Risen of course is facing an intrusive probe, but that is ostensibly part of a post-publication investigation to root out the leakers who are ostensibly breaking laws.<p>What is happening to Bloomberg, and what purportedly happens to typical Chinese news outlets, is a preventive, chilling action...and while you may argue that the thought of being targeted in a prosecutor&#x27;s probe can be just as chilling...I&#x27;d argue that it&#x27;s the frequency and the seeming arbitrariness of drop-in inspections is what makes the difference.<p>And so why doesn&#x27;t the NSA or even just the local police station doing occasional inspections? Because even if that were legal (which it probably isn&#x27;t), the public penalty for such actions is so high that most U.S. agencies seem content to duke it out post-publication. I don&#x27;t know how things are exactly in China, but I think you have to accept that not all intrusions on journalists&#x27; work are equal out of principle.<p>Note: there&#x27;s obviously selection bias at work here...presumably, we don&#x27;t hear about the journalism projects that are killed pre-publication, and we only know about the ones like Risen who sneaked their stories through.  But I have to seriously doubt there&#x27;s a significant number of secretly squelched stories, because again, the risk of an agency doing so is that it blows up in their faces, a la Barbara Streisand.",1386041314

I would <i>guess</i> that the way this worked in practice is that for lower resolutions they were effectively partially lighting up multiple phosphors per pixel on each pass? I imagine the difference between this an an LCD is that the amount of time a single pixel was lit by the beam on a CRT is far, far lower than the refresh rate of an LCD.<p>I believe there were monitors that went both ways with this, not just letting you run lower than native but also higher than native (I had a 17&quot; CRT that claimed to support 1600x1200, but not without a lot of blurriness, for instance).<p>edit: man, it&#x27;s really hard to find specific info about how exactly that worked online these days",1386041305

The value isn&#x27;t about (slightly) unique ways of thinking/talking <i>about</i> things, but (slightly) unique ways of expressing those thoughts. That is, without at least a good description of as many of the various grammars that exist, we lose a lot of data that can help us to understand language as a whole. F&#x27;rinstance, if languages like Hixkaryana had died out before being described, then the prevailing belief that OVS was an &quot;impossible&quot; regular order (as opposed to a special construction) would likely have become &quot;truth&quot;, and the possibilities only explored in artificial languages like Klingon. Losing that data means that we are losing the ability to make inferences as to how language works at the most fundamental level in the human brain.<p>On the other hand, it is rather inconvenient (from the perspective of a great global society) to have as many &quot;pure&quot; languages on the ground as we have (and have had). But while linguae francae bridge gaps across culture, full-time bilingualism and multilingualism tend to cross-fertilize grammars (and, of course, vocabularies), which has the effect of eroding the more interesting (and the most difficult) aspects of grammars in the smaller languages.",1386040707

Unfortunately many modern developers do not go beyond big O notation, which in many cases is totally irrelevant because they are talking about memory accesses which are light years faster than disk.<p>Actually, it is also useful these days to thing of whether work is done all in registers, all in L1 cache, all in L2 cache, all in RAM, all in disk cache(a form of RAM), all in disk interface cache(RAM on the hard drive controller), disk, or somewhere across a network connection which could be in the data center, across town, across the country or across the world.<p>It would be useful if training courses moved that big-O stuff off the the sidelines as a little historical note because it really is a theoretical analysis of algorithms, all things being equal. But in the real world, all things are NOT equal.<p>Similarly the issues around threading an locks on mutable state which can consume 50% or more of CPU time on a modern processer when an developer tries to roll their own multithreading.

I agree we would have eventually become a target regardless, but hopefully this would be because we have a well-known product.",1386039763

I got an itch to write some posts recently and wanted to set up a new site. This time around I decided I would do it with something git friendly, so that I could throw it on github and forget about it if I lost interest. I wrote a &quot;from scratch&quot; site with this in mind and it was working well, so I open sourced the core engine today. It runs on express and is about as bare bones as it gets. <a href=\"http://morganherlocker.com/post/badblog\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://morganherlocker.com/post/badblog</a>",1386039610

What do they look like in meta-SNE?<p>Well, it turns out that when you only have a very small number of neurons, they latch on to random useful features! These randomly selected features don&#x27;t tend to be the same, so you end up with the models horribly disagreeing on what is similar and what is different.<p>As you increase the number of neurons, the space of features they look at, if not the features of individual neurons, becomes similar across models. And so the models agree more, and cluster more tightly.<p>...<p>Another fun idea for using meta-SNE is ensemble models. We know that training a bunch of models and then averaging their results (ensembling) can improve results a lot. When is this helpful? My guess is that the farther apart compatibly good models are in meta-SNE space, the more ensembling will help, because they&#x27;ve learned different things.",1421431146

I think it&#x27;s <i>completely</i> relevant.<p>If a LEO mishandles evidence or otherwise makes a mistake (henceforth referred to as &quot;screw-up&quot;), and then admits such a thing under cross-examination, it&#x27;s <i>perfectly relevant</i> to the trial. In nearly all circumstances, those sorts of screw-ups are <i>completely</i> accidental (stress, overworked, etc.), and are extremely important to the jury&#x27;s decision-making process.<p>You know, I just read back through my original comment, and it seems to me that you&#x27;re conflating two separate points I made. So, perhaps I should reiterate and clarify in case my original comment was misleading:<p>1) DerYeghiayan&#x27;s admission was not a screw-up. You were confusing this with an example I used for purposes of illustration in my second paragraph. The agent is going to tell the truth, obviously, but he is <i>not</i> going to volunteer that information without first being asked while under oath (it&#x27;s not his obligation to do so). Again, not a screw-up. He just happened to share a detail that may possibly affect the jury&#x27;s decision.<p>This is also unrelated to point #2.<p>2) Where I mentioned screw-up was with regards to a trial <i>I</i> sat on, which I offered up tangentially as an example of mistakes law enforcement can make that undoubtedly change the direction of the trial toward an acquittal. During that specific trial, DHS border patrol agents admitted they handled the evidence without gloves--that was a complete and total <i>screw-up</i>. In fact, it was so much so, that I distinctly remember a comment made during cross-examination of the special agent assigned by the sheriff&#x27;s office. When he caught wind of what the DHS agents did, his first reaction was &quot;Crap! We screwed up.&quot;<p>So yes, mistakes can be made, and yes they&#x27;re <i>completely relevant</i> to the decision-making process of a jury.<p>Another example comes from the same jury pool I was assigned to, but on a trial I wasn&#x27;t part of. The trial lasted, as I understand from other jurors, for the whole of about 3-4 hours. During cross-examination, one of the LEOs involved inadvertently admitted details related to another case or circumstance involving the defendant (the exact details I can&#x27;t remember), and resulted in the defense attorney immediately seeking council with the judge, and the judge declaring a mistrial due to the nature of the material the officer shared while under oath.<p>So, no, I don&#x27;t agree. It&#x27;s completely relevant, <i>especially when mistakes are admitted or committed under cross-examination</i>.

To create a brush that behaves the way you want do the following: open brush settings panel (located on the upper right of the screen), go to the &quot;flow&quot; tab, change &quot;flow pressure&quot; to 100%, go to the opacity tab and change &quot;opacity pressure&quot; to 0%.<p>(we need to improve the brush settings)<p>2.

And interesting thing is, according to <a href=""https://www.mangaupdates.com/genres.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mangaupdates.com/genres.html</a> - there is more series targeted at girls than boys:  shoujo - ~17K, shounen - almost 9K.
Though it&#x27;s almost reversed for 18-30 age group: josei - ~7K, seinen - ~12K. In sum female oriented works trump male oriented (24 vs 21).<p>If only Japanese publishers (or it&#x27;s laws?) were not so narrow minded and hired fans that translate those mangas to fill something like iTunes/Steam library, any human being of any age and sex would have something to read their whole life.",1421428717

Naturally the culture and values of the company are going revolve around developers. But for a huge chunk of the companies out there everything revolves around sales and marketing. The actual role and importance of developers varies from company to company but very few of them are going to revolve around them in the same way. At many they&#x27;re an afterthought.<p>While there is no &quot;typical manager&quot; it&#x27;s safe to say that if you sample any given company and take all their managers and executives you won&#x27;t find a lot of coders. Executives don&#x27;t sit around talking about Rust vs Go, because it really isn&#x27;t that important to their business most of the time. So they really have no idea what it&#x27;s like to be a coder, and probably don&#x27;t take up a lot of cycles thinking about it.<p>Most jobs do benefit from collaboration. Development is no exception, however too much socialization and interruptions kill us. This is what they fail to understand on most levels. They see sales, marketing, and other groups that benefit from being able to swivel a chair and ask a question and automatically assume that it will help developers, since they &quot;never meet their deadlines&quot; anyway.<p>So in my opinion the push for open offices for coders is mostly out of touch thinking, a little need for micromanagement, and of course being able to show off work being done for people taking a walk through.

8900073,comment,8894902,8899763,0,0,xorcist,,,"> the CA system already exists and DNSSEC TLSA does not in any meaningful way.<p>Well, DNS exists. Most of what makes you uncomfortable with DNSSEC are really issues with DNS. But as long as DNS names are what you wish to secure, no alternative system could do that in a way you would be comfortable with. Unless you wish to replace the domain name system itself?<p>I guess what we disagree about here is if we need an alternative to the CA model. I believe we do, and I believe the most sound way is to cryptographically assert domain ownership. Such a model would be transparent in operation, not add any failure points except for the ones we already have in the domain name system, and be very clear to the end user in what it is we really secure.<p>(A common point made in the SSL CA system is that we want to secure &quot;entities&quot; and not domain names, and that is why a world wide PKI system should never sign keys based on domain names alone. I believe that is completely and utterly wrong. Most users actually do want to know that they are talking to the domain name bigbank.com, not the entity &quot;Big Bang Co. Ltd.&quot;.)<p>Given that premise, DNSSEC at least solves the right problem. One could argue that its cryptographic implementation is not great, and it&#x27;s not, but it&#x27;s pretty much identical to TLS and IPsec which is what we will use for the forseeable future.<p>> Not only am I right about RSA-1024 in DNSSEC, but I&#x27;m obviously and empirically right about it, as a trip to DNSviz will show you.<p>I do not follow at all. We will be &quot;stuck with RSA-1024 for the forseeable future&quot; because that is what people use today. That does not follow at all.<p>You could just as easily have said &quot;we will be stuck with SHA1 for the forseeable future&quot; one year ago, but reality just 12 months later looks very different.<p>> It would instead be based on online-signing,<p>This is a point you can make, but I disagree. We have seen more and more centralization in DNS serving infrastructure. Amazon and Cloudfront and the other big players serve more and more of the domain name space.<p>I think giving them complete powers to fully sign replies on behalf of the domain owners would be a mistake. It would clearly be a step to a more centralized PKI.<p>(And if government interference is what you fear, you should absolutely want offline signing. Amazon has yielded to government interference more times than I can count, while ICANN has not. Not that an online signing model would free you from ICANN of course.)<p>> Software today gets away with a shortcut in which it can assume that failed DNS lookups are the result either of user error or lack of connectivity.<p>No, you missed the point here, which is that all reasonable alternatives are worse off.

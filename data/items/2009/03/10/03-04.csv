For example, if the person is talking about their favorite dog. Ask 'How old is the dog?', 'Do they like cats?', 'Is it 730 already?' - then excuse yourself politely. It's not the most tactful way to extricate oneself from a running-over conversational hog but it works effectively.",1236657154

509459,comment,509283,509283,0,0,bbuffone,,,"I had the exact same problem a while back. It was while working full time and creating a startup on the side.  The stress of every thing resulted in the same symptoms. Every day I needed to resist the urge to go to the emergency room because I thought I was going to die of a heart attack. This lasted for about 7 months and I didn't tell anyone until eventually I couldn't take it and one night drove myself to the hospital.  After a series of unpleasant tests, it was just to much stress.<p>So what did I do to fix it?<p>1.) Realized the deadlines and pressure I was putting on myself were self imposed and definitely didn't need to be that aggressive.  One thing I have learned, all time lines and deadlines are made up (know one really knows, its just a best guess), unless there is a contract attached.  Doesn't mean be lazy and slack off.<p>2.) Better time management, context switching in life is aa expensive as it is on a computer, Set aside time for each thing.<p>3.) Task lists, every day create a list of tasks you want to complete and cross items off when done.  The sense of accomplishment creates a good feeling.  Tomorrow create a new task list, don't add to the old one, this is a good way to clear the list of all the shit that doesn't matter or has changed.  You are going to be behind schedule, the goals is to make progress and create milestones that can be reached.<p>3.) Balance your life, being heads down can only last for so long. Enjoy family, friends, people on the street, talk about what you are doing, get ideas and feedback. Get a way for a weekend, see #1 shit can wait a weekend.<p>4.) As soon as possible find someone that can start to use the software and give you feedback. It is amazing how one person giving feedback will help energize you. They will think the progress you are making is far better than you.  This is because what you are doing will hopefully help them in some way.<p>5.) Started exercising, eating better and stopped drinking Coke. Caffeine increases heart rate and only added to the problem, but I was drinking Coke to cope with the sleeping issues.  Exercise is always positive, don't need to run a marathon just get out and walk around, enjoy the sun.<p>6.) Massages, I made my wife start giving me massages and that worked really well. No wife, no worries, you can pay money for a professional.",1236655571

Again, you are passing your perception as absolute truth. What you may see is few comments that have a negative score. <i>Few downvotes and few negative-score comments are two completely different beasts</i>, and you're inferring wrong things with the information you have available.<p>3) <a href=""http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/inflammatory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/inflammatory</a> : tending to excite anger, disorder, or tumult.<p>My comment was a response to your post. It comes off as angry, but it is a reaction to the sort of thing that <i>you</i> write. The post has more than 100 comments, few of them actually accomplishing anything except discussing with you and pointing out why <i>you</i> are wrong.<p>So, the answer to your question is <i>no</i>; it's your articles that provoke reactions in others and excite disorder. It's your article that is inflammatory, not my comment.<p><pre><code>  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n</code></pre>\nAs a side note about what you write... I get it, Jeff. You're the textbook example of an extroverted person: you need to externalize things to process information. To you, doing supports thinking. For introverts like me (and most of HN, by the way) it's thinking that supports doing.<p>There is no ""right way"" here, no ""better side"" to belong to. The problem lies in taking these opposites to radical extremes, and this is what is happening to you. While hardcore introverts end up suffering from analysis paralysis and never get anything done, you end up doing things carelessly and using ""social brute-force"": you say whatever comes to mind and expect people to throw you ""warning messages"" and point you to a better solution.<p>Your blogging style is the equivalent of the guy that trolls in IRC channels (<a href=""http://bash.org/?152037"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bash.org/?152037</a>) to see if he gets responses from the gurus. This is seriously irritating: not everyone wants to be your ""idea compiler"", and you consume much of other people's time and energy that could be better used elsewhere.<p>You may even think that you are being successful with your approach: each post you write will probably make your readership increase more than decrease. But if you believe that, you'd be again relying on the idea that Quantity always trumps Quality, and again you'll be wrong by missing the point about the purpose of something like Hacker News.<p>Quantity trumps Quality on SO - you are more interested in having hordes of beginner and intermediate techies to drive traffic than lots of experts that don't need to seek technical help as often - but HN is about <i>insightful</i> news and comments, and for that you need the participation of above-average and like-minded people; it's all about quality, not quantity.",1236654314

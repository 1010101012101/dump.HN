The fact that we have been driven to madness by the horrible design of the web does not, in any way, mean that it&#x27;s not still madness to do it.<p>The ultimate goal is to deliver functionality to users.  Users don&#x27;t give a damn what the platform is.  They want application functionality which is as easy to access as typing an easy to remember name in an address bar.  The means of achieving this goal taken by developers have been convoluted in the extreme.  Each step has its own &#x27;reasonable argument&#x27; defending the decision made, but it still adds up to madness.",1410314350

I&#x27;d used Outlook for years never giving this more than a cursory glance. A few months back our entire office was placed on an outlook training course. I went in thinking this would be a waste of a day, yes a whole day on Outlook! It was worth it and I came out a convert for some functionality i&#x27;d not explored properly, tasks being one. You have to spend the time to restructure the layouts  (best thing is open task view next to the calendar and default to this view not email) and build categories. Then have the discipline to put things in tasks (Ctrl-shift-k). If in a team you can allocate them task too. The latter is great for me as I tend to pass on jobs, assume they will be done and then forget about them til I need it. This helps track these smaller easily forgotten tasks well. I&#x27;d really recommend giving it a go.<p>With OneNote, this is quite powerful but you have to take the time to structure & set it up. But once done it is super efficient to store loads of notes.<p>I realised I sound like a bit of a MS fan-boy, but I have tried loads of the usual suggestions and found these 2 products work really well together.

Then one of the main developers got pissed about the fact that he&#x27;d been secretly working for Mojang for free and used the DMCA to kill the whole thing off - something he could do because his code, and all of Bukkit, was licensed under the GPL and using it for modding Minecraft was a GPL violation(!).

They came to a fundamentally different conclusion for what a smartwatch should do, and I really enjoy the experience. The contextual information from Google Now is incredibly useful and it feels like my watch tells me not only what time it is, but information personally tailored to my lifestyle. For example, I always go out after work on Tuesdays, and right now my watch is telling me that there is lots of traffic on the way to my favorite bar. In the morning, it tells me how long my commute will be and what the weather will be that day. I can start navigation from my watch with my voice and get every direction as I need it. I can control any music player with notification support. I don&#x27;t run any interaction-heavy apps on my watch, and I can&#x27;t imagine ever wanting to do so.

And then also probably something to do with wiping out the parity blocks in a specific order.<p>This is a weird precision scenario. That&#x27;s not a random defect (bit-flip, which is what ECC fixes) - that&#x27;s a systematic error.

Energy drained to a point where the developers realized  that <i>as fun as Bukkit was</i> they might like to work on other things after so many years.<p>This point has been almost entirely lost on the reddit lynch mob.

8294372,comment,8290441,8293850,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>Convolutional neural nets have been around for a long, long time (early 90s? or maybe late 80s) and they just needed more data (and a few training tricks :) ).</i><p>The state of the art has become a lot better in terms of training deep (multi-layer) neural networks. The naive approach (start at a &quot;random&quot; weight setting, use gradient descent) that works on a convex error surface fails catastrophically on deep, complex neural nets. (Shallow neural net training is a non-convex problem as well, but seems to be &quot;less non-convex&quot; in practice.) In the past 10 years, people have become better at getting past that.<p>Theoretically, only one hidden layer is necessary for neural nets to be universal. Thus, for a long time, most research focused on single-layer networks because those were &quot;good enough&quot; to model any mathematical function. The problem is that convergence, for single-layer nets, can be very slow (especially given that you&#x27;re often doing <i>stochastic</i> gradient descent when working large data sets). Single-layer nets are often very difficult to audit. There&#x27;s a lot of &quot;cross talk&quot; where unrelated features are mapped to the same &quot;space&quot; in the network. So you have a &quot;black box&quot; that is hard to interpret.<p>Deep neural nets (which is what ML researchers call &quot;deep learning&quot;, until MBAs start abusing the latter term, as they have with &quot;big data&quot;) have come back into style over the past few years, due to recent research into how to make them actually perform, and findings about superior convergence with the right conditions. In deep nets, there&#x27;s often a problem of signals either amplifying or vanishing as they propagate throughout the net. The former leads to saturation (the neural net moves very slowly from a suboptimal but flat place on the error surface) and the latter is too linear and unlikely to pick up interesting features. Even now, making deep neural nets <i>not</i> sensitive to initial starting conditions is an unsolved problem, but there&#x27;s been a lot of progress.<p>I would hazard the guess that the convolutional technique is a lot more useful in deep neural networks than it is in single-hidden-layer neural nets.",1410311697

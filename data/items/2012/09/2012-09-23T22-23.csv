I don't know why you'd want to ignore the returned value and possible error on a GET request - given that 1) it can fail for so many reasons, and 2) the suggestion that you might be ""GETTING"" something. Ignoring the error of a print statement is more acceptable since it's unlikely to occur and there's rarely a lot you can do about it anyway.<p>Error handling is explicit, like the quote you quoted said it should be. If you ignore the returns (either explicitly or implicitly) you pay the price in debugging.<p>""leaving me confused as to which error happens when"" Panics happen when something very bad happens. You shouldn't be accessing off the end of an array, it signals that you've probably programmed it incorrectly, rather than it being a problem with your input (~ish).

Mypy differs in the following aspects, among others:<p>Mypy will have a powerful type system that can detect many type errors while supporting a very Python-like programming model. Cython has simpler types that primarily serve to speed up code.<p>Mypy will be able to speed up most programs, even programs that heavily use object-oriented features. Cython is primarily focused on speeding up numerical code and tight loops.<p>Mypy will have new virtual machine that allows speeding up all parts of the VM, including standard libraries and the garbage collector. Cython uses the normal Python VM.<p>Cython supports accessing C functions directly and many features are defined in terms of translating them to C. Mypy is not bound to any particular target language and can support both C and Java backends, for example.

The problem is not a lack of progress, but a very perceptible slowdown.<p>If you prefer to take it that way, we are no longer accelerating. Trace our economic progress on a plot, and the derivative will not be positive.<p>The problem is not so much in social programs or the leftist liberals, it's the burden they now represent and that we may not be able to afford for long if we do not start accelerating again.<p>Watch the parallel with the decline of the Roman empire:<p>""The historian Lactantius, who lived from 240 to 320, tells us that the problem was a bloated welfare state:
The number of [welfare] recipients began to exceed the number of contributors [taxpayers] by so much that, with farmers' resources exhausted by the enormous size of the requisitions, fields became deserted""

In Atlas Shrugged, behind the libertarianism, you can see the same very dim view of the future when fascism and communism seemed like the only ways forward for the masses, a moment which must have frightened a lot of people (I sure would have been frightened!)<p>Maybe our problem is the lack of hope in the future, which is reducing our will to live? I like the author conclusion a lot, because it catches the moment in our time when this happened - the hippies.<p>He may be wrong in framing it on their political views - the ignition of culturals wars may have been a strong factor, but at least it contained a hope for a better future.",1348440045

Let's suppose for sake of argument that major governments are prepared to recognize a new country's sovereignty and let them exist. Putting that country in the middle of the ocean is pointless.

The value of the currency comes from a foundation, and through many convoluted layers of society, that is built on education, discovery, and passionate individuals. We have many such people in America, but that population has not been growing fast enough to hold up the rest of the country. The economy is simply a way to try and measure the value of those individuals and the advancements they create for everyone else. The problem starts once we assume that more money fixes the economic measurement. It depends on where the funds are directed, and I believe that supplementing these funds to banks is how the Fed tries to create ""perceived"" value and growth. This creates a loop in the financial world that comes in the form of inflation. Inflation isn't good or bad, it is a by product of the real problem: trying to increase the value of an economy without actually supporting the creation of economic value. Economy is a measure of growth and innovation, and using fiat currency to increase the value of the economy, or more simply put, the ""measurement"" of economy, is a convenient way of fudging the numbers. The value or measure of economy then becomes based on societal beliefs instead tangible truths (increase in knowledge, health, etc).",1348439206

That's a common problem in machine learning and data mining as well (my area of research), where a large amount of nominal data can be misleading if what you're really trying to model isn't that common.<p>In this case the relevant event is sector-wide shifts in employment, of the farms->factories variety. We have very little data on those, because they occur once or perhaps twice in our data set. So we can't really generalize with any confidence about them: which features of that particular transition are general features of a sector-to-sector transition, and which ones depend on idiosyncracies of farms or factories or the particular time? Will factories->X look the same as farms->factories? We do have somewhat better data on which depend on idiosyncracies of place, since you can look at the industrial revolution in the U.S. versus in the UK or Germany or Japan (though those aren't independent data sets).<p>We have a lot of data in raw terms, but I think of that as just having data on a small number of macro-scale events, but at high resolution (monthly or better for many years). Now if we had observed 4 or 5 such macro-scale shifts (at least), that's the kind of data that would be needed to build a good model of how such transitions work. So I don't think we can say with much confidence, certainly not statistically valid confidence, how market mechanisms handle such shifts. What we have very good data on is how market mechanisms work in the ""normal"" case, within a largely stable paradigm. But for farm->factory type transitions, we have basically small-N case studies that people are trying to extrapolate from. The ""market will sort it outit always does"" view is certainly one possible extrapolation, but I don't think the evidence confirming it is very strong.",1348438089

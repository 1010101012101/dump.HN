749942,comment,749676,749768,0,0,kamme,,,"First of all, we have coffee places, just like in the US. But as far as I know, we tend not to bring our laptop along. I certainly never did it and I never saw it either. I must admit I'd rather read a book then take my laptop along...<p>Now, about the politics, yes it's true there where a lot of political problems concerning the separation of Belgium into 2 separate countries. Today (almost) nothing has changed. The issues the news reported about back then are still not 'solved'. It's just old news for the media and the people got tired of it so nothing happens anymore. But to give my personal opinion, there never was any problem. To me all the fuss was just to get some media attention for the elections back then and things got a bit out of control. The big problem should be between flanders and walloon, the 2 big parts of the country. But many of my colleagues are walloon and I have absolutely no problem with them at all, why should I? So my opinion about the whole issue is: it was just some publicity stunt. Sure we hear all the time there are 'issues' and flanders is giving (some politicians even call it wasting) a large sum of money to the walloon but I see it in a bigger picture. And as far as I know, that's the main issue about politics.<p>The last answer, the startup culture. To be honest, as I see it, there are 2 big cities with startups at the moment in flanders: Antwerp and Ghent. You also have Brussels but it's really expensive to live there, if you want to live in a 'better part' of the city. Starting up is not so hard, just get a BTW number (it's a special tax number), fill in some papers and you are working for yourself. The thing is, taxes are rather high so you tend to have less money left. Of course you have an upside too, if you should fail, you can apply for unemployment benefits and even take courses for free (they even pay you to do it in some instances). The typical startup here is different in the sense that here you don't make a web application that attracts a lot of people/investors, you make applications for clients. A group of people I worked with recently started their own little company ( <a href=""http://1md.be/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://1md.be/</a> ) and as you can see they follow that principle. I guess Belgium is just too small to do it the US way, it's even worse if you know websites from flanders who are immensely popular are not popular at all in walloon and the other way around. So in conclusion, I don't think we have the same startup environment as 'you guys'. If you should move only for that, I think you're in for a bit of a disappointment. Of course that's from my point of view!<p>Hope this answers your questions, if not let me know!",1249771358

When you make your first big mistake, open the #1 envelope and follow the instructions. When you make your second big mistake, open the #2 envelope and likewise follow those instructions.""<p>The new CEO was young, handsome and an accomplished public speaker. He and his family were featured in business magazines and were invited to speak throughout the business world at home and abroad.\nFor the first few months, things seemed to go along smoothly in spite of the CEO's frequent criticisms of the company's founders, business practices and employee performances. The new CEO seemed to relish pointing out the company's mistakes and perceived weaknesses.\nOne day, the new CEO committed a huge gaffe that headlined business newsletters and newspapers nationwide! He remembered the two envelopes given to him by his predecessor.<p>He rushed to his desk, seized the #1 envelope, tore it open and read it. The message was printed in bold black letters. ""Blame your predecessor.""\nImmediately, he convened a series of press conferences, blamed his predecessor and things seemed to calm down for a few months.<p>About three months later, he made another gaffe of greater significance than the first one. Before meeting with the board of directors, he opened his desk drawer and read the #2 letter. It stated, in bold, black letters, ""Prepare two envelopes!""",1249770571

749911,comment,749559,749559,0,0,grellas,,,"As a lawyer who has been doing this sort of work in Silicon Valley for quite a while, let me add my thoughts:<p>1. The Orrick docs are very helpful templates to assist founders in setting up a corporate startup. Orrick is an excellent firm and the quality of the templates is very good.<p>2. Founders should do their utmost to cut early-stage costs and this includes not overpaying for legal services. They should also do their best to educate themselves about the legal points associated with their startups. I believe strongly in this and have done what I call a Startup Law 101 series (<a href=""http://www.grellas.com/faq_business_startup.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grellas.com/faq_business_startup.html</a>) of articles whose very purpose is to help educate founders on such issues.<p>3. The key to any legal help you receive in setting up your startup lies in the expertise the lawyer provides. There is no substitute for this and there is no amount of study you will do as a founder that can possibly match it.<p>4. I know this from years of experience because, even with founders who have been through the full set-up process under good lawyer guidance, I have routinely seen them try to use the same forms to do subsequent documentation on their own only to have it come back in botched fashion. This often is not critical and can easily be fixed but it is another way of saying that such things do not consist merely of filling in blanks. There is a lot of underlying knowledge and experience involved in doing it right, especially where a founding team is involved with a variety of issues possibly arising among the founders.<p>5. For the same reason that founders have trouble managing such documents without expert guidance, so too would an unemployed law grad who really doesn't know this area. Basically, this is a specialty area and is often not well-done by inexperienced attorneys. Again, from experience, I can easily recall young attorneys I hired in my own office for the purpose of assisting me with getting such documents prepared. Skilled ones can do it with proper guidance but others cannot. They come back with work that might appear fine on the service but, scratch it a little and it falls apart (of course, such work would never be seen by the client - it would be redone altogether).<p>6. That said, I sympathize with your point about overpaying for lawyers. The larger firms practice a high-caliber form of law but it needs to fit with the needs of your startup for it to make sense for you. If it does not, it is an expensive mismatch. This is true for bootstrap companies in particular. It is important for such startups to minimize legal fees and looking for lawyers who will not cost as much (but who can still do the job well) is important.<p>7. Lawyers will not just give out templates, however, because this does leave them exposed in taking responsibility for a project. It is one thing for a founder group to want to ""do it themselves"" while being prepared to absorb any losses that might result from their not doing it right. It is quite another to do it yourself and then say that a lawyer was responsible because you used his template. Lawyers are paid to customize documents to fit the deal before them. A template is a startup point only. If it is to be used properly, it must be customized. This necessarily takes some effort that will cost money. And, take it from someone who has seen it all over the years, it is worth paying for the right expertise where needed, even as you try to minimize costs along the way. The process is a cooperative teaming and a good lawyer will work with you to so minimize your costs. But being frugal is not the same as being foolish. Where you do need the expertise, you need to be prepared to pay for it.<p>The startup world is becoming more and more an open field with fewer barriers to entry than ever before. The liberation of the legal side represents one part of this and is a good development. Just be smart about how you as a founder treat your new-found freedom!",1249769970

These days, laptop zombies tend to convert third spaces into glorified cubicles.  Wi-fi has taken formerly social environments, and made them creepy and dull.<p>I remember the first time I visited a coffee shop, long Before wi-fi was invented:  it was a social place that had big couches, plants, books and games.  People gathered there, played chess and cards over coffee, and there were even live performances of various sorts at night and on weekends.  Contrast to your typical coffee shop scene today:  rows of tables and uncomfortable chairs, doubled-up with dudes at laptops who have been camped out for hours, nursing a small cup of coffee.<p>Once upon a time, coffee houses were about relaxation and social life; today, they're basically about work.  So personally, I'm thrilled that cafes are starting to cover up power outlets, and I hope that they soon follow this trend with <i>paid</i> hourly wi-fi access -- or even eliminating the wireless access entirely.",1249769584

There are usually up to a few hundred questions from several categories that all come together in a single executive summary that should not run beyond a single page.<p>The 'recommendations and conclusions' section is the most important of this and lots of stuff doesn't make the cut in an explicit way but has to be represented somehow. Especially if the advise is not clear cut (this fortunately does not happen often but it has occurred).<p>Others than make the decision to go ahead or not in part on the information in this document, so it had better be weighted correctly.<p>I'm not sure if that is the kind of input you are looking for, but if it doesn't help I hope it doesn't hurt either :)<p>Best of luck with your search, if you find something outstanding please be sure to post it here.",1249769506

Whatever ""unconventional"" obscenities it may contain: <i>it's a dictionary</i>. Dictionaries (apart from weirdly bowdlerized ones) contain naughty words, and words that describe Very Nasty Things. A user is only likely to see those if they deliberately go looking for them. It doesn't seem difficult to me to understand why some people might find it odd for those words to require the thing to be given a 17+ rating; real dictionaries (which probably offer more opportunities for people to find ""cocksucker"" or ""genocide"" -- and, incidentally, isn't it bizarre to worry more about children finding the former than the latter? -- by accident than electronic ones like Ninjawords) don't generally carry age warnings or restrictions.",1249769228

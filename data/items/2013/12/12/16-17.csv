The examples I didn&#x27;t recognize as being specifically Taleb&#x27;s (and I have read all his books). These popular science examples get regurgitated over and over on websites, blogs and so on. Perhaps Taleb was the first to think of these examples, perhaps he was not.<p>For example the comparison between wall street investors and monkeys and the subsequent selection bias was featured in A Random Walk Down Wall Street - 1973.<p>So I&#x27;m not convinced there was malice involved here.",1386867572

Not to mention the fact that Dobelli reviewed Taleb&#x27;s book, and that other authors have noticed similarities.<p>Also this paragraph:<p><i>Note that correspondence of content doesn&#x27;t imply plagiarism. There is a book EXTREMELY similar to Fooled by Randomness called The Drunkard&#x27;s Walk. Yet not a shade of plagiarism. Why? the examples and terminology were very different. Some ideas can be rediscovered by two people. And when asked, the author said: Had I known about FBR I wouldn&#x27;t have written that book. An honorable man.</i><p>EDIT in reply to above edit: Note that Taleb isn&#x27;t saying he&#x27;s the originator of all the examples. Many are attributed in his footnotes, and he&#x27;s not claming authorship of them. Many of the examples, as you say, are already in the common consciousness. Taleb is using these examples to drive other points. The only thing he is saying - in this article - is showing how Dobelli is obviously plagiarizing what he has written.",1386867483

Here&#x27;s Taleb:<p>&quot;I was thinking about calling my third cousin Antiochus this morning when the phone rang. Miracle! It was him on the other line; this confirms my developed sixth sense! This is a great omen except that perhaps I should wake up and take into account the number of times when I thought about calling him without his calling me; the times when he called me without my thinking about calling him; and, most significantly, the numerous occurrences of my not thinking about him, and him not trying to call me.&quot;<p>Feynman has several variations on this theme.  Here&#x27;s one:<p>&quot;I remembered the time I was in my fraternity house at MIT when the idea came into my head completely out of the blue that my grandmother was dead. Right after that there was a telephone call, just like that. It was for Pete Bernays-- my grandmother wasn&#x27;t dead. So I remembered that, in case somebody told me a story that ended the other way. I figured that such things can sometimes happen by luck--after all, my grandmother was  very old--although people might think they happened by some sort of supernatural phenomenon.&quot;<p>And another:<p>&quot;You know, the most amazing thing happened to me tonight. I was coming here, on the way to the lecture, and I came in through the parking lot. And you won&#x27;t believe what happened. I saw a car with the license plate ARW 357. Can you imagine? Of all the millions of license plates in the state, what was the chance that I would see that particular one tonight? Amazing! &quot;<p>There&#x27;s an extended quote in the Feynman biography &quot;Genius&quot; (by James Gleick) which is a closer match than both these.

Taleb&#x27;s article is embarassingly bad.  Half his &quot;original examples&quot; I&#x27;d heard before from statisticians and other scientists, often years before Taleb&#x27;s books.  I will say this: there are a few instances in there where Dobelli should be genuinely embarassed.  But Taleb should be at least equally embarassed by presenting, Wolfram-like, well-known truths as his deep original thought.",1386866966

I quit cold by banning the offending websites using my linksys router:<p>● Go to http:192.168.1.1 using your browser, the default name and password is &quot;admin&quot; and &quot;admin&quot; (please change the password to a REALLY long one and write it down on a sticky note next to the router (if you haven&#x27;t already)<p>● Click the &quot;Access Restrictions&quot; tab | Enter a policy name and select &quot;Enable&quot; |  ignore &quot;applied PCs&quot;&#x27;s edit list | Set Access Restriction to &quot;Allow&quot; | Make sure the Schedule portion has &quot;everyday&quot; checked and &quot;24 hours&quot; selected | Enter the URLs of the 4 websites you&#x27;d like to block | and click &quot;save settings&quot; at the bottom.<p>● Sure you can come back here and disable the access restrictions, but it requires extra steps, requires you to get up, requires you to type in a long password. And by that time you&#x27;ll have realized what you&#x27;re doing isn&#x27;t good and stopped yourself. The whole point is to stop the bad habit of subconsciously typing in Reddit.com every 5 minutes. It took me a month and after whatever chemical high I had in my brain that was addicting me to Reddit/HuffPo/etc. wore off I just disabled the bans and haven&#x27;t been a Redditor ever since. I&#x27;ve visited Reddit months later maybe twice but didn&#x27;t care and haven&#x27;t been back since. I&#x27;m free.",1386865707

6895273,comment,6882107,6891457,1,0,graycat,,,"Two of the biggest &#x27;branches&#x27; of mathematics are\nanalysis and algebra.  Essentially the first course\nin &#x27;analysis&#x27; is calculus.<p>As in Simmons (in this list), the two most important\npillars of analysis are continuity and linearity.<p>The first place to learn linearity well is &#x27;linear\nalgebra&#x27; -- or, much the same thing, matrix theory\nor finite dimensional vector spaces.<p>Then the algebraic aspects can be emphasized and can\nlead to applications in, say, the theory of error\ncorrecting codes.<p>For the analysis aspects, can continue with Hilbert\nand Banach spaces and more and also various\napplications.<p>Much of the mathematics in applied mathematics,\nscience, engineering, and technology is linear\nalgebra.<p>Here is a list of books relevant to linear algebra\nand/or to the course I took from Roger Horn.  This\nlist also contains maybe 60% of what I&#x27;d worked from\nbefore Horn&#x27;s course that let me do well in that\ncourse.<p>========================================<p>Linear Algebra<p>----------------------------------------<p>Horn&#x27;s course was close to<p>Roger A. Horn, Charles R. Johnson,\n&#x27;Matrix Analysis&#x27;,\n0-521-38632-2,\nCambridge University Press, 1990.<p>with also a few topics from<p>Roger A. Horn, Charles R. Johnson,\n&#x27;Topics in Matrix Analysis&#x27;,\n0-521-46713-6,\nCambridge University Press, 1994.<p>----------------------------------------<p>The course also used for reference and some topics\nand exercises<p>Richard Bellman,\n&#x27;Introduction to Matrix Analysis:\nSecond Edition&#x27;,\nMcGraw-Hill,\nNew York,\n1970.<p>This book is just packed with little results; at\nsome point can get the impression that the author\nwent on and on ... writing.  Bellman was a very\nbright guy in mathematics, engineering, and\nmedicine.<p>----------------------------------------<p>Relatively easy to read and relatively close to\napplications, and another book Horn&#x27;s course used as\na reference, is<p>Ben Noble,\n&#x27;Applied Linear Algebra&#x27;,\nPrentice-Hall,\nEnglewood Cliffs, NJ,\n1969.<p>Some edition of this book may be a good place to\nstart for a student interested in applications now.<p>----------------------------------------<p>About the easiest reading in this list, and my first\ntext on linear algebra, was<p>D. C. Murdoch,\n&#x27;Linear Algebra for Undergraduates&#x27;,\nJohn Wiley and Sons,\nNew York,\n1957.<p>This book is awfully old, but what it has are still\nthe basics.<p>----------------------------------------<p>For my undergraduate honors paper I made some use\nof, and later read carefully nearly all of,<p>Evar D.

The book also has in the back a collection of\nadvanced topics, some of which might be quite good\nto know at some point and difficult to get\nelsewhere.<p>One of the topics in the back is linear programming,\nand for that I&#x27;d recommend something else, e.g.,\nChv&#x27;atal and/or Bazaraa and Jarvis in this list.<p>----------------------------------------<p>Likely the crown jewel of books on linear algebra is<p>Paul R.

Van Nostrand Company, Inc.,\nPrinceton, New Jersey,\n1958.<p>Halmos wrote this in about 1942 when he was an\nassistant to von Neumann at the Institute for\nAdvanced Study.  The book is intended to be a finite\ndimensional introduction to Hilbert space theory, or\nhow to do linear algebra using mostly only what also\nworks in Hilbert space.  It&#x27;s likely fair to credit\nvon Neumann with Hilbert space.<p>The book is elegant.<p>Apparently at one time Harvard&#x27;s course Math 55,\nwith a colorful description at,<p><a href=\"http://www.american.com/archive/2008/march-april-magazine-contents/why-can2019t-a-woman-be-more-like-a-man/?searchterm-Sommers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.american.com/archive/2008/march-april-magazine-co...</a><p>used this text by Halmos and also, as also in this\nlist, Rudin&#x27;s &#x27;Principles&#x27; and Spivak.<p>----------------------------------------<p>Long highly regarded as a linear algebra text is<p>Hoffman and Kunze,\n&#x27;Linear Algebra, Second Edition&#x27;,\nPrentice-Hall,\nEnglewood Cliffs,\nNew Jersey,\n1971.<p>========================================<p>Numerical Methods<p>----------------------------------------<p>If want to take numerical computations in linear\nalgebra seriously, then consider the next book or\nsomething better if can find it<p>George E.

Yes, we people were and are concerned, but as you may have heard in the media response. Otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t keep aired for so long, just because of honest journalism. They need money too.<p>Keep in mind that the &quot;Snowden Affair&quot; only reflects the morale of the citizen, not that of the government ruling their citizen. And the media can show it as often as they wish, but the German folk is the last to stand up for it. That&#x27;s really no pessimism. I can see that there are protests in almost every country in the world against Governments, for all kinds of reasons. I don&#x27;t know exactly why, but protests in Germany are much smaller and less frequent. I wish I knew why. Friends keep telling me that the folk is numb and doesn&#x27;t care anymore, but I can&#x27;t believe that. The situation is far worse in Italy and France where the entire media is ruled and owned by just one person for each country. However, that doesn&#x27;t really help us.<p>We&#x27;re probably the first nation, that officially &quot;fired&quot; it&#x27;s president (Wulff). According to him, it&#x27;s all because he called and threatened the Media, which started the anti Wulff campaign. That resulted in the media humiliating his credibility publicly. However, he wasn&#x27;t without fault, because he was cheapish and accepted offers from the industry. Now he&#x27;s at court, because of this! You can see this kind selfishness spread through the whole political landscape in Germany.<p>We have many parties, but only two that count: The red & The black party. Other parties are just their allies or help them to rip votes from their enemies. These main parties are very similar to the USA and represent the democrats vs conservatists.<p><pre><code>     * The Red (SPD) party originally represented &quot;The Workers&quot;..\n     * The Green (Grüne) party originally stood for the &quot;The Environment & Green Energy&quot;.\n     * The Black (CDU & CSU) party still represent the &quot;Conservative pro Economy & Industry opportunists&quot;.\n     * The Left party originally represented &quot;leftism&quot;, but now just fights for survival and represents popular ideas.\n</code></pre>\nThat back-story was needed, so that you can imagine how lost the fight is. Currently it&#x27;s as clear as never before, that all political parties agree on most points. Interestingly, they keep their meetings and agreements secret from the public. But announce things like agreements between the Green, Black and Red party. Should be shocking, but you can&#x27;t be shocked when it&#x27;s slowly introduced like this.",1386865248

Although it is not perfect, NPR seems to focus on the delivery of information in a balanced (if that is possible) way allowing me to draw my own conclusions.  My problem with the big news outlets (cnn, msnbc, fox, etc) is that they are clearly a business and focused on profitability (I have much empathy for them as I do the same when I am at work).  The problem is when editorial decisions are made not by what is news worthy but by what will draw the most eye balls.  For me it feels presenters are trying to one up each other with outrageous comments as their personal views become the story at the expense of the news.  I am sorry but I want the news presented in a sterile/factual way.  But instead it feels like American Idol with the presenters angling for a book deal, more twitter followers or other forms of personal enrichment.   Of course there is nothing wrong with self-promotion, I do it every day at work, but maybe I am old fashion in my longing for the days of Ted Koppel who for the most part delivered the facts as he knew them and purposely tried not to show emotion one way or another.  So I don’t think consuming news is bad but the self-promotion/echo chamber creating delivery of that news is another thing entirely.",1386865221

Most of these products don&#x27;t have images from the manufacturer. Why? Well there lots of reasons but it boils down to different configurations. It would be too time consuming to take an image of every product in every configuration for every model they sell. So they may have a generic picture of an exhaust system, that may or may not be the product you&#x27;re paying for.<p>I know that consumers like to see what they buy. I want to have pictures of every image I sell. To do that, I need to order 1 of everything I plan to sell so I can take photos of each item. As you can see it gets pretty costly. I&#x27;m spending time, money and effort, to give the best possible shopping experience. All while letting the customer know I have a product in my hands that my competitors don&#x27;t.<p>My competitors on the other hand. They just signed up for a new drop shipping account with the same distributor but guess what? They have no images of the items they sell and have no capital to order the item in. So where do they get those images? You guessed it, from everyone else.<p>When I first started I remember giving discounts to customers who would allow me to open their package and take showcase photos before sending them. I would be upset if someone used my photos without my permission. I don&#x27;t have time or money to police the internet. So I protect my investment through the use of the water mark. If not, it&#x27;d be like Ebay where you see 40 different sellers using the same exact product image, atrocious.",1386864772

Approaching it, fine, but at that specific velocity it&#x27;s downhill from here.<p>For definitions here let&#x27;s have Wikipedia[0] and Oxford dictionary[1]<p>0. &quot;escape velocity is the speed at which the kinetic energy plus the gravitational potential energy of an object is zero. It is the speed needed to &quot;break free&quot; from the gravitational attraction of a massive body, without further propulsion.&quot;<p>1. &quot;a speed for a particular vehicle, ship, or aircraft, usually somewhat below maximum, that is comfortable and economical&quot;<p>An object travelling at escape velocity without further propulsion will just (only just) escape the gravitational pull of the contextual body. That means by the time it&#x27;s distant enough from the body for the gravitational forces to be trivially weak, it&#x27;s going damn slowly.<p>This means the company is slowing down continually, relative to that body.<p>In terms of whether you can &quot;cruise&quot; at escape velocity, I don&#x27;t think so. Going at escape velocity for as much of the journey as possible would require a huge propulsion at the start, with a very high initial speed and use of fuel. I suggest cruising would actually be when you spend most of the journey below escape velocity by applying propulsion more steadily. The maximum velocity experienced in the company would be lower (comfort) and less fuel would be used.<p>The other downside of always being at escape velocity, unless the destination lies at a distance from the body where there&#x27;s still a relatively non-trivial gravitational pull left, there&#x27;s a good chance you&#x27;ll die before you get there.<p>[0] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity</a><p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cruising-speed\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cruisin...</a>",1386864522

We did some basic math on how much it&#x27;ll scale with our architecture (which I too agree wasn&#x27;t that good), and thought it would work reasonably until we grow quite big (at least half a million locations). I was/am new to app engine and was learning along the way.<p>The problem was when it started giving trouble even before 10K records, and not even more than 60 requests per second, which even a very low resource PC would handle without a problem since it won&#x27;t even take a few milliseconds to compute (probably even without an index, just a sequential search). And we had to make changes to fix this.<p>It went on and on; every few weeks, users and content would grow and our app would fail. We didn&#x27;t want to move away; just like you said, we thought the solution wasn&#x27;t to avoid it, but to solve it.<p>Finally, after changing/improving the design a number of times, we considered using app engine backends to do central stuff such as maintaining the main index. At the same time, looking back at what we&#x27;ve been doing so far, it was quite clear that we were spending our time, which for sure we should have spent on building something that adds value to users, on learning some platform and trying to alter our architecture to fit into it. And we were going deeper and deeper in the hole, and we knew it would be hard to move.<p>Our vision is simple, and it has nothing to do with picking up some technology and figuring out how to make use of it. Instead, we try to start from the customer and work backwards. While on app engine, we once stopped taking new low paying customers (listings), until we fixed issues - I think this was a terrible.<p>Decision of moving away from app engine wasn&#x27;t easy. We had to literally rewrite everything, and the fear of similar problems coming up was there.<p>Also, I never recommended anyone not to use it, I was just telling our story. In fact, I still use app engine for some work, and we would switch back to app engine if we are convinced that it&#x27;s the way to give a better user experience.<p>About data store being slow, they charge us per data store read. It slowing down as the number of reads increase, for me, sounds like saying it&#x27;s your fault if your calls drop because you are making a lot of calls.<p>About search API, we didn&#x27;t use it for auto completion; we maintain a small dictionary for that.<p>Just to clarify we were building the index at the start up.<p>About scaling, we have given some thought to it. But not so much since it&#x27;s not something we will require in the near future. We can create multiple instances and balance the load as long as the index is small enough to fit in memory.<p>I&#x27;m sure there is a way to get this working on app engine. But we are glad that we moved, and it runs smoothly. And more importantly, we have been able to give the users a lot more benefits during the past couple of months than during an year on app engine, because we had more time to focus on users.

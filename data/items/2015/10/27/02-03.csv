When one group is infamous for dragging the other through the trash, issuing death threats, bomb threats, etc. there is no &#x27;neutrality&#x27; to be found.<p>> And I guess people from both sides made sure neither could have nice things.<p>Again, bullshit. One side is know for getting death threats for existing, the other for sending death threats. One side is clearly to blame.<p>> (SXSW didn&#x27;t blame anyone, but that&#x27;s my guess.)<p>Clearly.<p>Now I know that the anti-GG people I know of have been VERY critical of SXSW for giving GG a panel in the first place. I know they&#x27;ve been campaigning and complaining. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ve expressed disappointment and probably personally boycotted the events.<p>But I seriously doubt the anti-GG people sent death threats.<p>On the other hand I can easily see the pro-GGers waning they would send them if their panel was cancelled, or the anti-GG panel wasn&#x27;t cancelled, or because of some other perceived issue (such as one getting a better time slot or bigger room).<p>And now that SXSW was cowered to the hate mob, I imagine they&#x27;ll get threats for for cancelling the pro-GG panel and letting the anti-GG people &#x27;win&#x27; (despite losing their own panel too).<p>It&#x27;s clear which side I&#x27;m on. I&#x27;m not trying to hide that I think GG is ruining my hobby. I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re setting our image back 20-30 years but I don&#x27;t remember death threats over NES games.<p>If SXSW wanted to be &#x27;neutral&#x27; and stay out of it they could have.

It was initially built on Shopify but I am currently looking to invest some money into rebuilding the website and am considering all my options.<p>I assumed it would be cheaper in the long-term to invest in having it custom made, but with the new Shopify online processing fees it seems this is not the case.[1] Shopify payment fees are 1.8% + 20p compared to Paypal which is 2.9% + 30p and Stripe which is similar. Even with the unlimited Shopify plan which works out at $2148 a year it&#x27;s still cheaper for me to use Shopify as I save ~$5000 on online processing fees.<p>My questions are:<p>1. If Shopify payment fees are nearly 1% lower than Paypal/Stripe, why does anyone still build their own custom website outside the Shopify platform? Is there some kind of catch I&#x27;m missing?<p>2. Are there any other platforms I should be considering building my website on?<p>Would really appreciate any thoughts or feedback you might have. If you need any more information please ask and I&#x27;ll be happy to answer.<p>Thanks in advance for your time,<p>[1] https://www.shopify.co.uk/pricing",1445914063

It had never occurred to me to use Ruby for scripting until I paired with a well rounded Rubyist. With the influx of people learning Rails, I&#x27;ve talked to many people who know much less about Ruby than I did when I was starting out.  This isn&#x27;t mentioned in the article at all, but it was definitely something I thought about when I decided to write it.  Honestly, if this helps push one new dev to go out and decided to actually learn some extra Ruby outside of Rails, I&#x27;ll be happy.<p>I agree 100% about the shell comments. I know enough shell to do my job, but for me it&#x27;s quicker to write a Ruby script.  Not saying it&#x27;s the most efficient way, but it is a way, and it&#x27;s more efficient than doing it by hand.  As much as I&#x27;d love to be a unix shell wizard, I&#x27;d rather be improving my Javascript, or learning more Elixir.<p>As for the namespace vs scope:  The example was just a way to end up with a scenario where we needed to change some text.  Plus, for clarity, if I don&#x27;t want my controllers or URL namespaced, my routes and files should reflect that, not work around it with a scope unless necessary for some reason(in my opinion).

235210,comment,234777,234827,0,0,krschultz,,,"Do what you love is not ""do what you would do if you had infinite money"". If I had infinite money I would be heli-skiing every day. That is not monetizeable. I could be a ski instructor for a lot less, but that is not what I want to do. So moving down to one of my interests, robotics, I work for a company doing close to that. Thus I'm happy at work.<p>I guess by extension if you did what you loved most we'd all be porn stars. It is more about doing something you like.",1215096801

Is Powerset's search technology really better than Google's? I'm not too sure.<p>It's a good acquisition for msft, but Google is usually better when it comes to choosing startups to buy that are real winners. I honestly think that Google would have scooped them up sometime over the last 3 years if they really thought they were a threat. Just my hunch.",1215096756

235202,comment,234637,234637,0,0,solost,,,"I think there are two factors you need to use to decide for yourself.<p>One, what would you rather be doing?  You're young you have time so you cannot go wrong in either direction.<p>Two, what opportunities are available to you?  Can you go to a really good MBA program?  Is there a start up you are going to join that you are passionate about?  Are you going to start your own business?  If so do you really know what that entails?<p>So my advice analyze your opportunities, decide what it is you really want to do, but unless you have a killer idea and some people to help both technical, marketing, and business wise don't start your own start up yet.",1215096426

That's for 1 TB of data transfer in and 1/10 of that out (presumably one would pull down only sorted indices, not the entire sorted dataset), and 910 Extra Large compute instances for an hour.  The price goes up pretty quickly if you spend longer than an hour setting up your many nodes.  Obviously feel free to check my assumptions.",1215094556
235181,comment,235074,235152,0,0,jcl,,,"I think lawsuits against <i>viewers</i> is purely speculation by TechCrunch.  IANAL, but I think pinning a copyright violation on a viewer would be very difficult, because the viewer is in a poor position to know the legality of a given clip -- especially prior to downloading it -- which implies that the uploader, not the downloader, is responsible for any violation.  I'd guess this is why to date the RIAA and MPAA have only gone after P2P uploaders and BitTorrent users (where each user is both an uploader and downloader).<p>Just think... if merely clicking on a link were a copyright violation, Rick Astley would be a billionaire. :)",1215094546

And thats irritating.<p>But like some people mentioned, there are a lot of SEO tips that people should be aware of, and quite a lot that programmers should be aware of if they're going to program a good site. Some simple programming choices in the beginning can make a big difference to your site's ranking, so if you're not aware of what those are, then you're not being a good programmer.

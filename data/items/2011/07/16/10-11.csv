Some descendants think still that the Empire did net good, but they are ignorant of many of the details.<p>The example I gave shows starkly their attitude towards those they subjugated, and if you go to the wiki linked, you will see it was a popular viewpoint. It's an effective example exposing the views popularly maintained by those holding power in the Empire. How can people holding these views do more good than harm, overall?<p>A famine on the doorstep of a superpower is not forgiveable, no amount of scientific progress or engineering prowess can forgive it. Many of the things they credit themselves with improving they initially instigated and promoted, e.g. opium trade, slave trade, penal colonies, regional wars arising out of 'divide and conquer' tactics. They were not a civilising force.",1310813532

This is not about Facebook's legal rights to do stuff: it's about whether it's a smart business decision to exercise those rights in certain ways.<p>Facebook wants to be a useful platform for its users, including companies as users. A platform is not useful if any nitwit can file an infringement claim and get a page taken down. It's in Facebook's best interest to review such claims closely enough to notice that, for instance, they have no reason whatsoever to assume that the 'Mr. Stevens' from the story is actually a laywer representing anyone. At a bare minimum, infringement claims should come on good old paper or should be cryptographically signed, in order for them to be taken seriously.<p>As such, this shows a serious problem with Facebooks proposition to small companies. If you use them, and use them successfully, you open yourself up for extortion. That can not possibly be something they want.",1310811344

Comparing the two and claiming that it is entirely due to Britain's involvement with India is ridiculous.<p>2) Famines have a long history in India. During the British-led period, they were particularly bad. However, the strong system of government instilled by the British did pave the way for an organised, united Indian government that heaped resources into agricultural research in the post-war period.<p>3) It's not just British people that are racist. That's a feature of almost every culture and society. This is pretty much beyond dispute - take a look at the Indian caste system, for example.<p>4) This was done pretty much at the insistence of contemporary Muslims and Hindus. That it was done poorly is not disputed - that it is entirely the fault of Brits is a ridiculous proposition. India and Pakistan have been free from British rule for decades - there doesn't seem to have been any increased tendency for detente and diplomatic relations now that the British are inconsequential, does there?<p>You are also completely ignoring any effect that British rule had outside of the Indian region, aren't you? British ships were instrumental in stopping the slave trade in Europe, and British rule brought all kinds of scientific, engineering and medical progress to countries that, at the time of arrival, were still practising human sacrifice and had life expectancies in their mid-30s or younger.

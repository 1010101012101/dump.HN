A raindrop only has some simple function that completely describes it, and this function likely has only some bytes. You can't take any information out of a raindrop, because the particles within it are random.<p>A raindrop is made up of a certain number of atoms, but these atoms are all the same, and cannot store any information. To store information, you need items that are dissimilar to each other. So the comparisons he makes are not correct.",1226529310

362420,comment,362029,362212,0,0,tdavis,,,"I don't say this very often, but: Are you <i>insane</i>?! First of all, any argument that starts with ""Once you have kids"" isn't an argument at all; I knew I should have stopped there and saved myself money on blood pressure medication.<p>Secondly, why is it the Government's job (or <i>anyone's</i> job) to ""protect vulnerable people who might--"" okay, I can't even do this. That phrase means the same thing as ""protect them from themselves"" -- the <i>individual</i> makes a poor decision which affects <i>the individual</i>.  Since it falls to a parent to make responsible decisions for an ignorant child, you've once again failed to make a point.  ""Once"" I have kids (I like your finality), I will probably make sure to avoid having them <i>raped</i> to save $10.  I could be wrong.<p>As for smoking, it is once again an individual choice.  Were there no smokers, I'm sure there would be others ready and willing to use tax dollars to pay their medical expenses (which I have never done, and since I've given years of service to this country everyone can fuck off anyway).  If a private establishment decides they wish, for whatever reason, to permit smoking on their property, that is a right the company rationally deserves and in no way warrants regulation by the Government or any other regulatory body.<p>If you prefer non-smoking establishments, show it with your wallet.  If such a time came when it was detrimental to a business to afford said luxury to smokers, they would stop.  What you feel is ""kinda nice"" should not warrant a <i>law</i>.  It's called personal preference and we all have it.  If all of my personal preferences were turned into law, there would be many changes to the world, most of which many people would conservatively call ""cruel and unusual.""",1226529149

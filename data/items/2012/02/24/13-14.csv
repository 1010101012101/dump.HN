I had to switch my proxy configuration all the time due to the company firewall and I remember had lots of throttle making Git recognize it.<p>Integration with other tools:\nSince the windows Git requires a custom shell, its harder to integrate with other tools E.g.

This isn't to say you shouldn't dabble in new languages and frameworks as they come out, but unless you're willing to cross bridges, the amount of time you'll spend learning the language, getting accustomed to new tools etc. will cost you more in time than is worth it to keep up to date with your core languages (especially if they're as fast-paced as Ruby).",1330089642

We use languages to solve problems. Working in an unfamiliar language makes the problem harder to solve, not easier. Unless the new language is a much better fit to the problem at hand.

There is no problem with the internet, but the industries, that see internet as a potential new source of (parasitic) revenue, are <i></i>creating<i></i> a problem so that the politicians ca <i></i>solve<i></i> it.<p>> but then how do we make money without intellectual property rights<p>I really don't know. But maybe you should ask Paulo Coelho, the developers behind The Indie Bundle, or Monty Python (<a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/kit-eaton/technomix/monty-python-youtube-move-boosts-dvd-sales-23000"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/kit-eaton/technomix/monty-py...</a>).<p>> We talk of freedom, artistic expression, and creativity, but at the end of the day, someone has to get paid.<p>Well, who said that art must be paid for, and that it must be paid for by the customer? In my opinion, art made for profit is not art, true art comes from within, and is expression of the soul, which would need to be expressed even if there was no money coming from creating art. Even so, the politicians and lobbyists emphasise the ""successful"" artists, those earning big bucks, but really there are many artists that are only losing/spending money doing their art, but still do it. After all, we're all artists.<p>Furthermore, that artists have to ""make a living"" is a relatively new idea. In the past, artists had donnors, rich people who financed them so that they could create in peace, without worries.",1330089057

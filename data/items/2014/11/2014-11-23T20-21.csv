8649909,comment,8649579,8649579,0,0,badgersandjam,,,"Don&#x27;t bother running a mail server. It&#x27;s hell. I did from 1998 until about last week. I started running it on a cable modem with an old Compaq desktop, migrated to a dedicated server (which hosted a load of other stuff) and finally onto VMs.<p>I have spent hours getting myself of blacklists after entire IP ranges were reported. I&#x27;ve spent hours working out why the hell Postfix won&#x27;t talk to dovecot on a local socket, upgrading Linux distributions, postfix and dovecot and being fucked over by config format changes and periodically losing entire mailboxes to IMAP bugs. Oh and SELinux - hours of it.<p>The thing that finally killed it for me was Yahoo. My landlord uses Yahoo mail for comms and Yahoo just decided to stop accepting delivery from my server. It took a phone call from me asking him why he hadn&#x27;t sorted something for me and for him to tell me that he didn&#x27;t get the email to discover this. So I dredged through the logs, found an error from yahoo&#x27;s mail servers saying I need to hit a web form to prove I was a legitimate sender. So I did that, and nothing, not a sausage happened. Googling around says I need to wait 6 months before submitting the request again.<p>I have no power in this situation. I can&#x27;t email my landlord. I need to do business, not piss around with politics.<p>So in a fit of anger, I blasted my VM on Linode, went to my local supermarket, bought a Moto G2 in cash to replace my Lumia 630 (which was doing IMAP) that I just smashed the screen on, signed up for Google Apps free trial and just moved the domain over to that.<p>Just can&#x27;t be fucked with it any more. I run &quot;inbox zero&quot; (i.e. I delete religiously) so there is no cost for me to migrate.<p>I don&#x27;t care if they read my email or shop me to the feds; I&#x27;m tired of herding servers and software these days. A decade ago I could quite happily spend all day doing it but I have better things to do now.",1416776380

8649906,comment,8648680,8649190,0,0,justifier,,,"there is a great story about the construction of the dome of the duomo in firenze,
the commission was given to brunelleschi but due his unconventional pitch and revolutionary ideas he was required to coopt the work with ghiberti,
a contemporary who defaulted a different commission that was refused to brunelleschi due to his ideas being ahead of their time<p>brunelleschi protested but eventually agreed to allow ghiberti to be on site and help with the work,
and though brunelleschi laid some of the most dangerous bricks himself, ghiberti was said to have spent his time drinking and lazing off,
this infuriated brunelleschi who knew ghiberti was unable to do the work necessary but would eventually share in the credit,
and after some time brunelleschi fell ill and tended his bed,
ghiberti was then forced to take lead on the project but being as he was unqualified to lead the project the project began to fall apart<p>before it was completely scrapped the city fired ghiberti and the next day brunelleschi&#x27;s illness lifted,
he returned to finish the job and the dome still stands to this day",1416776313

He can probably fund a bunch of startups to tackle most instead of complaining.<p>You know what I miss most? While there are plenty of online courses, some even for particular specializations, noone offers &quot;synthesizable&quot; courses targeted at arbitrary special fields with arbitrary preexisting skills. For example, I want to learn everything about state-of-the-art battery production (e.g. how factories operate, what the scaling issues are etc.). I have a background mostly in IT, physics from school, strong in mathematics. I should be able to choose this specialized topic and then &quot;add&quot; prerequisite courses until I&#x27;m confident that I can build on my existing knowledge and get exactly what I need to know to become proficient in battery production.<p>My current choices are either to study physics at a major university and try to find courses that cover my target topic to specialize towards the end (realistically, I&#x27;d have to read 100+ publications to cover recent advances), or to find books on the topic and whenever I feel I lack knowledge to understand a book, other books to cover these holes. Very difficult, trial-and-error and slow. Or I could hire a personal trainer(?) proficient in the field (how to find?) to get me there.<p>Neither of these seem very attractive and efficient and having a flexible online course system for this purpose would really help. Any takers? Don&#x27;t you want a simple, effective way to become proficient in a particular field without wading knee-deep through useless material for years?",1416776182

8649891,comment,8649361,8649574,0,0,Attic,,,"Signal can be closely compared to the IO Monad in Haskell. The point of the IO Monad is to have a clear separation of pure and impure values. When a function returns a non IO value (Or Signal) it is pure, this means that no matter how many times you run that particular function with the same arguments, you will always get the same result back. Of course you can still achieve this through careful programming but people make mistakes.<p>So why lift? If we receive a value through IO (e.g. Mouse.x) we can&#x27;t determine the value beforehand, thus it is impure. Let&#x27;s say we create a function to increase Mouse.x by a certain number, it&#x27;s signature would be this: Signal a -> a -> Signal a. If a function takes a Signal as argument it must return a Signal as well. So now we&#x27;re writing impure functions thus losing a lot of safety. Instead we can write pure functions where we don&#x27;t have to worry about outside input and still apply impure value to it through lift. I&#x27;m not writing Haskell professionally, however I try to apply this technique in my daily work with other languages. Create as many modular functions that don&#x27;t interact with IO as possible, and try to limit yourself of retrieving IO values in too many different places in your code.<p>I personally love IO Monad / Signal, they taught me how to write better code in other languages. It might seems like a hassle at first but if you get into it you&#x27;ll see their charm :)",1416775956

Virtually the entire map from the spawn point to 5km from spawn is a desolate wasteland littered with ruins griefed bases, castles, and megastructures.<p>With the introduction of the hunger system everything got a lot more interesting, requiring new players to make a mad scramble from spawn and try to find some source of sustenance. It&#x27;s not uncommon for new players searching for food to duck into a 2-3 year old base that&#x27;s been long abandoned but has a few precious pieces of bread left in a chest.<p>Typically players will build their bases anywhere between 10-500km away from spawn, and when they do, they build some of the most impressive bases I&#x27;ve seen in the game.

8649774,comment,8648220,8648664,0,0,jandrewrogers,,,"The Xeon Phi uses a different computing architecture than either a CPU or a GPU so some intuitions about using it will be off. The Phi is essentially a modern barrel processor that uses the AMD64 ISA (it does not understand legacy x86 modes), a really nice vector ALU implementation, and memory bandwidth that is more like a GPU than a CPU. While it will run normal 64-bit software reasonably well with no special considerations, it will not be efficient without tweaking code design. CPU-targeted code attempts to optimize IPC in a single thread; barrel processors are designed to hide latency and <i>can&#x27;t</i> drive IPC through single thread optimization.<p>The reason barrel processors are interesting is that they can be incredibly efficient with their clock cycles. Unlike either CPUs or GPUs, it is relatively easy to get sustained throughput that approaches the theoretical IPC of the silicon for diverse software. The Xeon Phi mentioned in the article has 114 ALUs; it is possible to ensure all of those ALUs are doing useful work every single clock cycle, unlike the much smaller number of ALUs in your CPU. CPUs and GPUs have higher theoretical throughput in some cases but various parts of their ALUs typically spend a significant part of their time idle.<p>Contrary to marketing, you do not want to program these like an ordinary CPU even though the cores are truly general purpose (unlike a GPU). Thread behavior is unlike CPUs or GPUs. Barrel processors cannot saturate a single core with a single thread! The Xeon Phi has 228 independent threads and you need to use them all the time.<p>The way barrel processors work is if the hardware supports N threads then each clock cycle you can saturate all the ALUs if some subset M of those threads are not stalled. The M-of-N ratio varies by barrel processor design but is typically 20-50% in my experience. Each clock cycle, a core selects an immediately runnable operation from the basket of threads it can see and executes it; as long as <i>something</i> is runnable in that basket, the core will do real work that clock cycle. Xeon Phi has a 50% M-of-N requirement, so you need a <i>minimum</i> of 114 threads that are not stalled every clock cycle to saturate the processor. The way you ensure that you hit the 114 threshold is to schedule all 228 hardware thread slots with useful work.<p>For programming, this changes the way you reason about locality and concurrency. If we assume that some percentage of threads can be safely stalled or blocked with no impact on throughput then it changes the way you design your algorithms and data structures. A little additional latency on a subset of threads won&#x27;t hurt performance, especially if it increases task concurrency. On a CPU stalled threads are expensive, as it leads to idle cores or context switches. For architectures like Phi, you design your data structures and algorithms around relatively small, semi-independently work units so that there is always a large number of tasks that can be assigned to a thread even though this reduces locality. Below a certain threshold, thread concurrency is approximately free because the cores will schedule around stalls due to contention.<p>I like barrel processors quite a lot. Once you get used to the model, it is an easier architecture with which to achieve efficient massively threaded parallelism and throughput than either CPUs or GPUs. More importantly, they are hard to beat for efficiency for general purpose computing when software is designed for the architecture since so few clock cycles are wasted.",1416773762

They take a large amount of investment before they start to pay off, unlike most buildings, and they can&#x27;t really be fully appreciated except from map views like this site, so they&#x27;re kind of low-reward for the people doing the work, too.<p>I only run a vanilla server, so I don&#x27;t know how mods might affect that.

Specialization is required to make progress, but it means that nobody really understands the choices we have when it comes to technology.

The main reasons for their naiveness are: most of them are extremely junior, most of them come from different countries with a different cost of living, and most of them are under a visa so there&#x27;s the lock-in effect.<p>Now, the company recently got a very significant round of funding, so now it seems like the compensation will be brought to a market-ish level (probably a bit lower than that), and the raise will come from a performance bonus at the end of the year instead of a base salary increase.<p>For a professional like me this is just complete bullshit: getting a bonus of 30-40% your base salary is wrong for so many reasons, such as:<p>- you get the money at the end of the year, so you have a huge cost opportunity lost<p>- the bonus is under employer&#x27;s control, next year it might disappear<p>- the base salary will remain low and this will jeopardize salary negotiations with future employers<p>- if you leave say in June, you effectively lose next_year_bonus/2<p>How should I approach this problem, considering that the rest of the employees are simply amazed and extremely grateful for this bonus?",1416773055

We eventually narrowed down on a problem everyone was discussing and was trying to build various home grown solutions to.<p>After reading all the great posts by Jason Grigsby (<a href=""http://blog.cloudfour.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.cloudfour.com/</a>) the problems with sending one-size-fits-all images to mobile and tablet devices was obvious. Additionally, most existing solutions require you to pre-scale/crop multiple versions of the same image which is tedious and labor intensive. Even the proposed srcset attribute and picture element have this requirement.<p>Next, we looked at any existing players in the space and found that a few where starting to crop and getting traction which further validated our premise that people where looking for a robust solution.<p>So, we considered it worth at least building an MVP and will soon be looking for interested parties to try it out (drop me a line if interested - and yes, our site is butt ugly).",1378241960

I mean, looking back at the article, the spoils of this program are incredibly paltry given the enormity of the data set. Criminalization of drugs and Militarization of enforcement groups is not significantly deterring usage because they are so ineffective even with so many resources and so little respect for the civil rights of users and non-users alike. All these programs have been effective at is raising the bar for drug distribution organizations to a point where militarization and violence is necessary for operation.<p>>Coffee addictions don&#x27;t lead to more violent crime or robbery, as far as I know.<p>Perhaps they would if they were criminalized.

It&#x27;s a matter of wanting things to make life fun/interesting.  &quot;Normal middle-class people&quot;, whatever those are, are always going to want things/experiences/what-have-you -- it&#x27;s part of the human condition.  Conversation, libraries, art galleries have been around for thousands of years, so that&#x27;s not really going to change things at all.  The internet certainly has changed the pattern of behavior for humans as a whole, and made access to information much less skewed towards the upper classes, but I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s going to make the &quot;middle class&quot; disappear.<p>In a sense, I don&#x27;t think most people&#x27;s happiness is limited by money.  Surely the lack of money can bring unhappiness, but I think generally the middle class is happy, and has been for the recent past (just for the sake of argument, the last 3-4 generations).<p>Maybe my definition of &quot;middle class&quot; is wrong?  To me, the &quot;middle class&quot; encompasses the people who still have to work a job, but are able to pay all of their bills in a timely fashion, save some money, and generally support themselves and their dependents.  Lower class would mean people living paycheck-to-paycheck or maybe slightly below: just existing means going backwards.

Morals come in when he recognizes that this is wrong, and can be solved by society as whole. Not specific people.<p>>Why do you think it&#x27;s ok to take care of your family and friends less and care about strangers more?<p>This safety net isn&#x27;t exclusive to &#x27;everyone else&#x27;. It is in place to catch everyone, including your family and friends, and their family and friends, and those who might not have family and friends. How is paying a measly some annually/quarterly caring about strangers more? It doesn&#x27;t necessitate taking care of your own less, and is a straw man on your part. To me, it is a pittance of a tribute to the fact that &#x27;others exist, ugghhh&#x27;.<p>> if somebody forces you to help the poor, are you really becoming a better person?<p>That does not matter. What matters is that someone isn&#x27;t starving, homeless, or without medical care.",1378238423

By &quot;optional&quot;, I presume that means at added cost. By &quot;supports&quot;, I think that means you&#x27;re on your own as to distro (though I suspect a device-specific distro would come out in short order). The $45 version only ships with 512mb RAM - I run servers without windowing environment in that space all the time, but perhaps one of the smarter Linux gurus can comment as to suitability for running XBMC, etc?",1378238406

Although IBM says they formed through a merger of three companies in 1911, it&#x27;s origins started in the 1880s and I count that as the true beginning of IBM. Note that in 1911 the company was called CTR and they kept that name until 1924, so either way I don&#x27;t think 1911 accurately reflects the founding year of IBM.",1378238405

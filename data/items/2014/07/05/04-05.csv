7991082,comment,7970366,7970366,1,0,nonagonal,,,"Edge, Inc. - Boston, MA - REMOTE possible\nedge.recruiting.boston@gmail.com<p>About Us:\nWe’re a small company founded by MIT grads that is taking a data-driven approach to online retail. We buy and sell goods in online marketplaces at a large scale based on mathematical models and our solutions to a set of optimization problems. We employ more than 50 workers around the world, but the core team has only a few engineers who have automated most of our process. Our infrastructure is built completely in Python and runs on AWS.<p>Our core team is very small, so our culture is laid back and fun, but we’re all driven and work very hard. We’d like to find a candidate who can thrive in such an environment.<p>About the Job:\nWe’re looking for a full-stack Python developer to create the next generation of our infrastructure. It’s running on a single AWS server, but we’d like to move to a more scalable distributed model. The infrastructure mostly consists of a backend framework that generates very large datasets, organizes & processes the data, and makes decisions in realtime. There is also a front end written with Flask that will need to be redesigned eventually.<p>The new infrastructure will need to rely on test automation throughout the code, so we’re looking for someone who really understands best practices when it comes to testing. We can handle controlled downtime, but data integrity and the decisions our algorithms make are critical to our business, so we need to build up several layers of testing to ensure correctness.<p>Responsibilities will include:\n- Rewriting our Python-based backend and frontend so it’s more maintainable and scalable\n- Deploying the new infrastructure on AWS\n- Helping us migrate from the existing codebase to the new one\n- Modifying the new codebase as we move forward and develop our mathematical models and algorithms<p>Required Qualifications:\n- Strong Python development experience\n- A solid grasp of test automation, and more importantly some real enthusiasm for it\n- Experience designing and deploying on cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services\n- Familiarity with both SQL and NoSQL databases, especially relating to their performance\n- BS Computer Science or equivalent<p>Preferred Qualifications:\n- Experience working both single-handedly and in small groups (2-4 developers)\n- Experience with popular Python frameworks and the ability to learn new Python frameworks quickly<p>Email edge.recruiting.boston@gmail.com to learn more.",1404536263

Selling something for $1 hurts you more than it helps you because it attracts the &quot;wrong&quot; customers and also lowers the perceived value of the product.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if there is a market need (don&#x27;t know much about Bitcoin) but you can&#x27;t expect to find any customers without putting significant effort into marketing it. Maybe try content marketing, writing about Bitcoin security and how to protect oneself. One problem I see is that people may not be actively looking for a solution. People don&#x27;t care about securing their wallet until (like you) they have been bitten by malware. Convincing existing Bitcoin users that securing their wallet is important seems like a difficult task because you need to educate them. That&#x27;s the problem of being the first-mover in a market (I assume there aren&#x27;t lots of competing products). If you have competitors they can do the educating for you.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to put your efforts into marketing maybe just leave it there for a while. As Bitcoin becomes more popular it may well be that people come realize the need to secure their wallet. Maybe it&#x27;s just a bit too early?",1404535792

If he had been as trained in knife fighting as I was in hand combat, he would have been able to destroy me. But he had a tool that he felt gave him an advantage (...)</i><p>You can have a false sense of confidence that because you possess a particular tool, you&#x27;re safe, even though you have no idea how to use it. If the first time you discover how the tool works is in a dangerous situation, you&#x27;d likely be much better of if you didn&#x27;t have that tool in the first place.<p>I applied this lesson many times in my life. For example, after a theoretical worplace safety course at my job I realized I have no clue how fire extinguishers actually work, so I bought one and fired it outside in an area where it wouldn&#x27;t disturb anybody. And now I know how extinguishers behave and what to expect from them. Another time, a friend of mine was planning to buy pepper spray, because she was often returning late at night from university. I told her to buy two cans, because just having a spray will instill a false sense of confidence in her. We used up the second spray for &quot;training&quot;, for her to see how it actually works, so that in case of real danger, she wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about how to use the gas and how it actually works.",1404535712

I have some opinions on what leads people to ultimately get divorced; however, without any evidence to back them up, those thoughts aren&#x27;t even worth mentioning.<p>My belief is that marriage (at least for me personally) is a lifelong commitment, and divorce is only an option in the cases of abuse or cheating.  In that sense, my biggest fear toward getting married is that the person I marry would at some point change who they are (&quot;get bored&quot; in modern parlance) and divorce me.<p>At this stage in my life (24 years old), I&#x27;m slowly realizing that I probably won&#x27;t ever get married even though I would really like to... I just can&#x27;t imagine meeting a person I feel so certain and comfortable about.  Heck, I can barely even find someone I want to date.<p>I was speaking with my sister (engaged) the other day and asked her how she knew she had met the right person, and she told me that her fiancé is the only guy ever that she felt like she wasn&#x27;t playing &quot;mind games&quot; with.

They had a lot of good ideas and frankly they were right on a lot of issues that helped win Obama the election when the rest of the Republican party was still gunning for more war in the Middle East the public no longer supported. Oh, and the economy.<p>Here&#x27;s what happened...<p>Even with millions raised, the Republican nomination went to John McCain who brought us Sarah Palin. Months after a sound defeat, Fox News and Glen Beck co-opted the Ron Paul/Tea Party movement, which they previously spent 2 years making fun of, into the corporate political machine that it is now. The Tea Party of current times has little in common with the Tea Party that tried to get Ron Paul the nomination, twice.<p>This is a very long winded way of saying I&#x27;ve seen political movements pop up online before and they tend to fizzle and die, or have the energy co-opted into something that is not the same thing at all.<p>I fully expect if this becomes a big enough deal for some Democrats and Republicans to once again crow about campaign finance reform (because it sounds good, just ask John McCain),  that it will get co-opted by big money into somehow reinforcing the current system or otherwise giving big moneu politics further advantages.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that any of us fully grasp how much money truly controls the political process at every level.

It also offers (configurable) data compression and a non-fragmenting storage mechanism, which means <i>tremendous</i> disk usage savings in update-heavy workloads. It&#x27;s quite a lot faster both reading and writing in many cases (particularly when you can take advantage of clustering keys). It&#x27;s not without its faults, but the things it has over vanilla MongoDB far outweigh its faults, IMO.<p>It would be nice to have geo-indices and full-text search (we use ElasticSearch for the latter in concert with TokuMX, and it supports geoindices too), but  &quot;server doesn&#x27;t fall over under high load&quot; is a lot more important to us (as users, I don&#x27;t work for Tokutek). 2.8 promises to bring MongoDB up to speed in a lot of respects, but it&#x27;s definitely not accurate to think of TokuMX as &quot;MongoDB 2.4 except with faster writes&quot;.",1404534540

The effect is to emphasise presentation over content, which doesn&#x27;t please those who are more interested in the latter and certainly isn&#x27;t any better for accessibility.

The child is asked if they did the bad thing, just exactly as George Washington was asked in the story. A very young child will be able to make the connection between what is happening and the story they just heard because the exact same thing is going down.<p>The other stories are more abstract. They are not stories of someone doing a bad thing and then being asked if they did the bad thing.<p>It&#x27;s a more reasonable conclusion, in my opinion, that what we are seeing is an effect of how close the story is to the experience, without having to rely on abstraction skills a very young child does not possess. And not whether the outcome was good or bad.<p>In general the study design is poor and more people should have seen that. There are numerous differences between these stories, hundreds of differences, not just outcome. And one of the stories being much closer to what they are testing is obviously relevant and confounding.<p>A better study design would be able to explore this. For example, tell the children one of the following stories:<p>1. George Washington does a bad thing and is asked if he did it. When he says yes, he is rewarded.<p>2. George Washington does a bad thing and is asked if he did it. When he says yes, he is punished.<p>3. George Washington does a bad thing. He is not asked if he did it, but is rewarded by fate.<p>4. George Washington does a bad thing. He is not asked if he did it, but is punished by fate.<p>5. George Washington does a good thing and is asked if he did it. When he says yes, he is rewarded.<p>6. George Washington does a good thing and is asked if he did it. When he says yes, he is punished.<p>7. George Washington does a good thing. He is not asked if he did it, but is rewarded by fate.<p>8.

You can deposit (from PayPal), pledge, get paid, and withdraw (via PayPal). All real dollars.<p>2) If you've got projects you've already mostly finished, you can easily start a project as sole developer. If you just want a simple donations-only project, type in $0 for the quote amount after you've created it (it shows you how). Yes, we know this is klunky -- fix coming soon. :-)

Predicting how long it will take to implement a totally new program with lots of unknowns is crazy in itself. Trying to estimate how many LOC it will take _another_ programmer and then estimating a schedule on the fly like that is just pure fantasy. It's also <i>unbelievably</i> aggravating to be on the receiving end.<p>John Carmack's permanent answer on projects is ""When it's done"". The only truthful answer when developing anything new and interesting.",1185439815

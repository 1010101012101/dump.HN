Close to 15 000 0000 times as much. <<<<p>Hm, I made a big mistake in that comment. I should have added that we have access to this much, but the real catch is energy and how we are currently limited to tapping into it and the total resource we can access is X.<p>Thank you so much for pointing this out.<p>>>> it mostly just requires more energy <<<<p>Yeah as I argued in another comment, that really is the unmentioned catch over here. I should have elaborated upon that in the parent. Sorry.<p>Even if most of humanity doesn't reach that level of consumption, we will need to start unlocking some of this resource sooner or later. What really worries me is the amount of energy we need to unlock all of this water locked away in glaciers, ice caps and so on and then actually manage to process and distribute it for final use.<p>That's a really interesting but hard engineering problem.<p>>>> Technology which is clearly within our reach would allow the earth to support trillions of humans -- admittedly at a more crowded level than I would prefer. :) <<<<p>Can you please elaborate more?",1319990391

They treat it like a magic solution that will cure all their scaling issues. Node.js is useful for I/O bound apps which are not CPU intensive because then your event loop is nothing but a ""manager"" which manages multiple incoming requests, and hooks them upto the I/O in an asynchronous manner and when the I/O finishes, sends the result back. For such use cases, node.js is very efficient and scales well (in the sense that with just one node.js process, you can handle many requests).",1319989767

By and large, men still run the country. Politicians, bankers, and judges are all overwhelmingly male. Make fun of a man in a commercial for being stupid? It's funny because the CEO of the advertising is almost certainly a man. Make fun of a woman for being stupid? It's less funny because as recently as when our parents were growing up we actually did make such commercials, except we meant it and actively excluded women from the workforce.

3174604,comment,3174062,3174210,7,0,nandemo,,,"My impression is that programmers who work in the gaming industry programmer in the US accept poor work conditions because they love games, they love writing games, they feel there's a certain ""glamour"" to it, and also (sort of recursively) because of peer pressure. Similar to aspiring Hollywood actors and film makers. So the employers take full advantage of that. But it's really the programmers' choice. I'm quite sure anyone working on writing games (as opposed to actors) could get a job with better conditions in a MegaCorp very easily, if only they could bring themselves to write ""boring"" apps in a corporate environment. And I suppose after a certain age, getting married and having kids, many game programmers will eventually do that anyway.<p>Here in Japan the problem is deeper. It's not limited to a subset of IT/software companies, so there's not much choice. The difference between working in a big company and in a so-called ""black company"" is not <i>that</i> big. It's mostly perceived prestige and stability, not so much actual work conditions like hours, pay and career path.<p>To make things worse, this is a country where social change happens very slowly. Technological novelties are readily embraced, but companies would rather slowly sink than give equal opportunities to women or foreigners or otherwise change their modus operandi. Some examples:<p>* companies expect hand-written resumes. You're a student applying to 10 companies? Write 10 resumes by hand. Oh, and include a picture.<p>* if you're a woman, things you should expect to be asked in a job interview: ""Are you planning to get married? Are you planning to have kids? If so, are you leaving the company?""<p>* are you 30 years old and already changed jobs twice? Job hopper.<p>* are you over 35 and want to change jobs? Too old.",1319989404

This is part of why (last time I checked such statistics), on average, women who defend themselves with lethal force (usually premeditated and with a weapon) against an abusive husband do more jail time than men who finally beat their wives to death (""heat of the moment"", with their bare hands) after years of abusing them.<p>I think electromagnetic makes some good points.  That doesn't justify a woman slapping a man but a) it does put it in a different light and b) there are many forms of abuse, so just focusing on who got slapped hardly tells the whole picture. I will note that I read somewhere (probably many years ago) that when men were asked what they most feared from a woman, the consensus was ""being laughed at"".

Nobody has support staff for SysAdmins, and yeah, while I recognize the need for bureaucracy and tight bookkeeping, I don't enjoy dealing with those things and I'm not very good at it.  It's really nice to hand a wad of receipts to someone else and say ""yeah, this was for the conference last week""  and have them handle the paperwork.",1319987142

Some possibilities are laser launching, space elevators, launch loops, and electromagnetic guns.<p>Some of these have much higher startup costs (to be effective for human launching, a gun would have to be very, very long and possibly cost the most of any of these, but shorter ones could launch material at very high acceleration with much less up-front cost), and some of them have awful failure modes (the space elevator could spread destruction in a narrow path wrapped all the way around the earth if it failed in the wrong way, via separation from the counterweight), but they're feasible.<p>The cheapest ways of getting to orbit, therefore, approach the cost in electricity of the task, which is less than 10 KwH per kilogram, or about $2USD per kilo.  A recent flight from coast to coast cost more than that for me.",1319986920

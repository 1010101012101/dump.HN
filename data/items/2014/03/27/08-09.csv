Any sufficiently big organization will be fragmented into groups that hardly talk to each other.  At that point, if you want code that&#x27;s usable by several groups, you must publish it as if it were Open Source (and have it compete with <i>actual</i> Open Source code).  That is so much effort that most simply won&#x27;t do it.  It may not be even worth the trouble since the different groups are probably working on different software anyway.<p>While it makes sense to follow some unified standard <i>as a team</i>, it makes much less sense <i>across</i> teams.  With few exceptions, there is no &quot;grand scale&quot;.",1395910738

By directly, I guess you mean by crawling the web ? You&#x27;re right about the fact that it would give access to more data, but, as Klout measure is people-centric, a social graph API is a more straightforward data source. Associating web pages to unique identity of persons is a challenge of its own.<p>> Klout were never going to gain the level of access the needed to the graphs on the various networks they utilized<p>Given their scale, access to twitter graph data should not have been a problem (they have enough users not to be bothered by the API&#x27;s rate limits).

7479238,comment,7478367,7478872,6,0,bad_user,,,"&quot;Production environment&quot; is a very relative and subjective notion. We used Scala on the server-side for basically real-time bidding, with the servers receiving several thousands of requests per second per server instance, with a total of about 30,000 reqs per sec of real traffic coming in, to which we had to reply in a maximum of 100ms which included the network roundtrip. Without Scala, without the ease with which I could juggle with concurrency issues and asynchronous processing of streams, I couldn&#x27;t have pulled it off. So in other words, Java is unfit for a production environment from my perspective.<p>> <i>one of the biggest is IntelliJ&#x27;s capability as Java IDE</i><p>That&#x27;s a pretty shallow reason if you ask me, because the speed of writing code is not the point and IntelliJ IDEA 13 is also very, very good for Scala development.<p>> <i>I just dislike Scala&#x27;s monstrosity. I have high hopes for Kotlin</i><p>Well, there&#x27;s your problem. You thought that Scala is something that it isn&#x27;t, like a &quot;better Java&quot;. If you approached it like that, without delving in its FP capabilities that Java 8, Kotlin, Ceylon, Groovy cannot match (or whatever &quot;better Java&quot; is the fad du jour), then of course it was a bad experience.<p>Next time you&#x27;ll have some time to burn, start here: <a href=""http://www.manning.com/bjarnason/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.manning.com/bjarnason/</a>",1395910085

In principle, that&#x27;s exactly what the IRS wants to tax. A currency system should generally preclude any barter by assigning reliable values to both parties&#x27; goods, such that the one whose stuff is assigned a higher monetary value by the market will be unwilling to make the trade, since they could do better by just selling their stuff and buying the other party&#x27;s. (A raw trade could still happen where the market value of each party&#x27;s offering is somewhere within the bid/ask spread of the other&#x27;s.)  But that&#x27;s independent of what &quot;barter&quot; <i>is</i>.  Barter is just trade unmediated by a currency. You can realize taxable gains through barter in just the same way that my uncle once paid his rent for a month by selling an art object he bought at a garage sale for under $100.  Despite being mediated by cash, that was a highly uneven trade, and barter is no different.<p>In a happy coincidence for the IRS, assigning monetary values to everything makes it trivial to assign a value to the trade for the gaining party to pay tax on. Again, not relevant to what barter is.",1395908352

As assessed on pathological analysis, an excess of neurons in the prefrontal cortex among children with autism signals a disturbance in prenatal development and may be concomitant with abnormal cell type and laminar development.\nMethods<p>To systematically examine neocortical architecture during the early years after the onset of autism, we used RNA in situ hybridization with a panel of layer- and cell-typeâ€“specific molecular markers to phenotype cortical microstructure. We assayed markers for neurons and glia, along with genes that have been implicated in the risk of autism, in prefrontal, temporal, and occipital neocortical tissue from postmortem samples obtained from children with autism and unaffected children between the ages of 2 and 15 years.\nResults<p>We observed focal patches of abnormal laminar cytoarchitecture and cortical disorganization of neurons, but not glia, in prefrontal and temporal cortical tissue from 10 of 11 children with autism and from 1 of 11 unaffected children. We observed heterogeneity between cases with respect to cell types that were most abnormal in the patches and the layers that were most affected by the pathological features. No cortical layer was uniformly spared, with the clearest signs of abnormal expression in layers 4 and 5. Three-dimensional reconstruction of layer markers confirmed the focal geometry and size of patches.\nConclusions<p>In this small, explorative study, we found focal disruption of cortical laminar architecture in the cortexes of a majority of young children with autism. Our data support a probable dysregulation of layer formation and layer-specific neuronal differentiation at prenatal developmental stages. (Funded by the Simons Foundation and others.)",1395907218

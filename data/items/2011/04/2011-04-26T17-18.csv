We are talking specifically about paying programmers by their ""productivity."" If you want to say that ""productivity"" is defined as the correlation between a person and project success regardless of whether there is a causal relationship or not, and regardless of whether they engage in programming activities, project management activities, picking good project activities, discussion activities, or even just making everyone else espresso so they can produce working code, that's fine.<p>But what we're saying in that case is that we can't measure the productivity of a programmer, we can't establish a relationship between programming activities on the scale of a single person. I agree that the correlations you can observe are perfectly useful for management and that one can deliver great (or working, or valuable) software without an objective metric of programmer productivity. I agree that this elusive metric may not be necessary. It may not even be useful, as I tried to demonstrate elsewhere when I discussed Ned, Fred, Ed, and Jed.<p>But that really underscores my point: We can't tie compensation to programmer productivity because we can't measure it. Your point seems to be that we don't have to tie compensation to programmer productivity, that we can tie it to correlation with project success, for example.<p>Fine with me, I'd say we're in violent agreement and that our stances are compatible.",1303839070

2486248,comment,2484677,2484677,17,0,lmkg,,,"Some background on the problem this is trying to solve:<p>There are a handful of mathematical theorems that basically say ""there is no perfect voting system."" More rigorously, they enumerate a list of desirable properties that you would like voting systems to have, and show that <i>NO</i> voting system can have all of these properties, because they are actually contradictory.<p>Some of these properties are things that are ""obvious"" ones that any practical voting system should satisfy: voting matters, there is no dictator, candidates can win, determinism. Two of them are non-trivial: absence of tactical voting, and irrelevance of independent alternatives (IIA). Tactical voting basically means you have a game-theoretic incentive to vote in a way that differs from your true desires. IIA basically means that if Gore would win a 2-man election against Bush, adding Nader to the race should not make Bush the winner. These properties are related, but not the same.<p>All of these properties are desirable, and a ""perfect"" voting system would have all of them, but you <i>can't</i> have all of them. You have to pick at least one to give up. Tactical voting in particular is extremely hard to remove, even if you give up IIA, while systems that satisfy IIA are somewhat complicated. The article suggests that it is very easy to satisfy all of the other criteria, if we let go of one of the ""obvious"" criteria: determinism.<p>So it's basically a question of picking your poison. You can have determinism, or you can get rid of tactical voting, but you can't do both. The author is contending that determinism is the best property to give up.<p>Further reading: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrows_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrows_theorem</a> is one of the mentioned theorems, dealing with ranked-preference voting systems (vote-for-one-candidate is a special case). There are a few others for different classes of voting systems.",1303838827

Your statement <i>""Depreciation isn't further payment due,...""</i> is correct but this part <i>""...it's an asset write-off""</i> misses the point.<p>Assets have ""lifetimes"", which is to say that if you are using something in your business venture, it will eventually be ""used up."" In the case of computers they don't generally break but historically they get faster and can do more for the same amount of power approximately, historically doubling in performance every 18 months or so but now more like every 30 months or so. When an asset is ""used up"" you are going to have to replace it to keep your business running. So you're going to 'buy it again'.<p>Consider an alternate strategy, lets say there was a company that had a credit card that charged no interest and had a 60 month (5yr) payment plan (kind of like some car deals I guess). If the payment is 1/60th of the price of the gear each month, then that is clearly a bill that we pay every month. Now at the end of 5 years we ""own"" our equipment outright, except its 5 years old.<p>Do you remember what was 'hot' in the PC business in 2006? Sure you do, go to blekko.com and type 'site:pcworld.com /date=2006' and one of the results is ""Hot technology in 2006"" [1]. Looks like 750G drives, and ""the fastest desktop chips we've ever tested, the Intel Core 2 Duo."" So if you had bought gear in 2006 you would probably have machines based on the Core 2 Duo architecture which is pig dog slow compared to a decent i5 or i7 motherboard today. Guess what? You need to buy new machines to stay competitive. (or as this is a web enterprise at least 'add' machines to stay competitive).<p>Depreciation is a way of capturing a ""future"" expense in today's revenues. If you are profitable, even after including your depreciation costs, then you should be 'banking' those costs so that in five years when your gear needs to be replaced or added too, you've got the capital you need to do that. If on the other hand you aren't profitable when you include depreciation (a state known as being 'under capitalized') when the time comes to replace your gear you won't have the money (capital) to do that, and you will either have to raise money, go into debt, or fade into obscurity with increasingly out of date gear.<p>The bottom line is that rather than being ""an accounting trick,"" including depreciation in your cost structure helps you understand the total cost of owning, and operating, a bunch of gear which is powering your business.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.pcworld.com/article/128176/the_20_most_innovative_products_of_the_year.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pcworld.com/article/128176/the_20_most_innovative...</a>",1303838485

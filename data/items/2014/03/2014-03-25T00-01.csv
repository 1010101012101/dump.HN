7462963,comment,7459435,7460308,5,0,userbinator,,,"That reminds me, I stumbled upon some <i>very</i> interesting discussion here while doing some research on lion characteristics a few weeks ago:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lithium-ion_battery/Archive_1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lithium-ion_battery/Archiv...</a><p><i>But real batteries are obviously unaware of these sources because there are numerous examples in the wild that have been regularly fully discharged (to 2.8 to 3.0 volts), stored at around 20 °C and kept fully charged in between times. These batteries are over 12 years old and are fully functional. The data in the article suggests that these batteries would have expired years ago, so something is clearly wrong.</i><p><i>In fact, real world batteries can last 15 years or more. The one thing on that site that I can positively say is false is the claim that batteries degrade if discharged below 30% charge. I can say this because myself and 2 colleagues made this defect up and deliberately planted it for the guy who actually runs BatteryUniversity to find and incorporate into the site (and he did it within 2 weeks). It was about the most harmles thing we could think of, but several manufacturers did incorporate features in their products to warn of impending discharge below 30% charge (and to be fair, probably did it with the best of intentions).</i><p><i>Actually, most lithium-ion cells have excellent shelf lives (10% loss of charge in 8 years, and military cells still delivering full capacity after 20 years of collecting dust</i><p><i>Li-ion batteries are only dead after 2 years if they are abused or their charge/discharge life is used up. Properly cared for real world Li-ion batteries last for 10 years or more (in spite of Isador Buchmann&#x27;s claim to the contrary).</i>",1395708833

To make up for this, the way you have to match 1s and 2s together (as opposed to simply matching the values, as you can in 2048) makes organizing the lowest level of the board slightly more complicated.<p>I frankly bet if we asked the developer of Threes about the 1st and 2st thing he&#x27;d say he toyed with the idea of a game where the matching was more direct (as its pretty obvious consider it) and realized that it felt &quot;too easy&quot;: the only thing making 2048 continue to be difficult is the lack of explicit control over the tiles; though, that also makes it easier, as you can move items much more quickly around the board without more clutter appearing.<p>I would say this is similar to how in Tetris Attack you can horizontally swap any two tiles, but in Bejeweled you can swap tiles vertically or horizontally, but only temporarily: they have effectively the same mechanic (you need to match tiles of similar color), the same overall physics (items drop to fill in gaps), the same kinds of tactics, but the amount of control you have over the game board and what moves you have are quite different in feel due to the seemingly minor control changes.<p>(FWIW, I find Tetris Attack and 2048 &quot;fun&quot;, and I find Bejeweled and Threes &quot;infuriating&quot;. This is likely somewhat to do with the fact that I find Tetris Attack and 2048 &quot;easier&quot; than Bejeweled and Threes, but I would hope that it is more to do with some of the things I really enjoyed about Tetris Attack--the speed of movement, the building of structure, and the intricacy of &quot;skill chains&quot;--not being tactically relevant in Bejeweled, and in the case of Threes that the 1s and 2s are randomized in such a way where I often feel &quot;this game isn&#x27;t even winnable: I have a board full of 1s... this isn&#x27;t even fair&quot;, which is a situation fundamentally impossible in 2048.)",1395708719

To me, this community is still one of the absolute best for impartial, high level, and overall <i>courteous</i> discussions about a lot of hot button and polarizing issues among some very smart and influential people (and this is completely setting aside the wonderful technical/startup aspect). Very often you find those who lose their cool downvoted to oblivion for the sake of rational discourse, whether people agree or not, and every day that warms my heart and gives me hope for the future of humanity. The greater internet has evolved into a global phenomenon, and with that has come an Eternal September of those who believe that anonymously shouting as loud as they can in comment sections and forums is a substitute for high level reasoning and discourse, thus I am driven to ever smaller enclaves, HN being one of those.<p>For people that pride themselves on seeking out and eradicating cognitive biases both within themselves and within others I saw a dis-heartening amount of group think and cognitive dissonance among many earlier today. People who have been trusted as linchpins of our community for many years were immediately attacked <i>for simply not being vitriolic towards BE, and even more worrying, his supporters</i>.<p>I will lay down my life for you to exercise your freedom of opinion and speech (this is not hyperbole... I see no point in living if I may not live freely), and some days I honestly wonder about whether my children (should I chose to have progeny) will enjoy those same freedoms, thanks to the fine people at the NSA. Yet never once was I ever afraid of being silenced on my home turf, if you will. Never could I have fathomed the amount of simple hate that came <i>from both sides</i> today. It shook a lot of my belief in this community, and made me finally realize that maybe PG has been right to tighten the moderating screws.<p>As I&#x27;m sure a lot of you were, I was frequently bullied and insulted as a child and teen. Being different made me an easy target, and I still suffer from both the physical and emotional scars that I received. I would hope that many of you would remember a time you too were the target of a larger group simply for not conforming to what they expected. I would hope that many of you who were so quick to spew insults and acrid words would take a step back to remember that we are all human beings, that we are all different in so many wonderful ways, and diversity of thought, opinion and person is what makes us strong.<p>Marriage equality is a large issue in our society today, and fortunately we still live in a country that gives us the right to freely express our political and social beliefs. We still have the right to change our government for the better. We still are able to mold our society as we see fit. Please, take your righteous anger and use it for the better good. If BE infuriates you, then go out there and start getting signatures on ballots in the various states where marriage equality is either ill defined or non-existent. If you subscribe to BE&#x27;s views then start calling your representatives. Show your &quot;hacker&quot; spirit and build a website that provides literature on your beliefs, no matter what they were. But for the love of all that is good, and true, and beautiful, do <i>not</i> tear down a fellow human for simply exercising their God given (as per the Constitution and Human Rights charters) rights by voicing their beliefs, however repugnant they may be. Pain and suffering is a zero sum game, and the increase of it does our whole species a disfavor.<p>If you must find a direct release to your anger please aim it at those who seek to incite this kind of partisan behavior for their own good. It would treat us all well to remember most of us have either purchased goods from companies that have given donations to both sides of the aisle on this issue, and yet we do not tear their representatives limb from limb when the topic arises. Being equitable in your dealings will never hurt you, I can assure you of that.<p>These are my two cents.

That catch was that they&#x27;d have to do so under oath, meaning that any known falsehoods presented as truth could lead to charges of perjury.<p>The supporters ended up saying nothing. So while it turned out that these supposedly religious people had no real concern about bearing false witness in the eyes of God (who is, perhaps, more forgiving) they were a lot more circumspect about doing so before the State of California.<p>In terms of lingering ill-will, it&#x27;s not just the cause people are upset about.

And the worst part is that now, after taking such an unambiguous stand against the values of moderation, diversity, and tolerance, Brendan is appealing to those exact values when defending himself against the backlash.<p>Most reasonable people know that tolerance cannot extend to intolerance, and that preserving a society that is generally inclusive and respectful means getting pretty intolerant with those who attack its ground rules.

They want it because of <i>State granted privileges bestowed upon married couples</i>. Those <i>aren&#x27;t</i> rights.<p>Unfortunately, some of those privileges <i>restrict the rights</i> of <i>all unmarried persons</i>. Particularly with respect to hospital visitation.

I won&#x27;t go down that road...<p>With that said, you&#x27;re basically telling me that I oppose something that I don&#x27;t think even exists in the first place. To me, rights are much more fundamental than constructs like marriage.<p>The problem is that the debate is framed in terms of gay marriage. One&#x27;s position against marriage in general can subsume one&#x27;s position on gay marriage. But the lynch mob lacks perspective and can only imagine that being against gay marriage means being against gays.<p>Once you finally recognize that, &quot;oh gee whiz, yeah, being against marriage in general is cool, but still, you aren&#x27;t pragmatic enough for me.&quot;<p>OK.

If you don&#x27;t trust the Sandstorm team to host your server, then by all means, don&#x27;t get hosting from us.

We absolutely should do that over the long term, but it requires a fundamental policy shift, and a willingness for governments to spend money on a group of people who basically have no political voice out of the recognition that it&#x27;s the right thing to do.<p>It&#x27;s not the only component of the problem of prison population control, but deinstitutionalization under Reagan absolutely punted the mental health issue to the prison system.<p>I worked in the criminal justice system in an inner city for a medium sized metro area. We&#x27;d have cases where a guy would repeatedly break into a business, not to steal anything of value, he was just schizophrenic and felt he needed to be in there some nights. Turning him back on the street perpetually screws over the business owner, incarceration without treatment risks ruining his already fragile life. There weren&#x27;t an abundance of good options, and everyone in the courtroom, prosecution, judge, public defender, they all recognized it.<p>This was an extreme example, but mental health issues weren&#x27;t atypical. It wasn&#x27;t the majority, but a substantial fraction (guessing here, maybe 10-20%?) of the cases I saw involved some underlying mental health issues.<p>The criminal justice system is just at its worst with these defendants too. For serious crimes, juries just never find them sympathetic, even if their mental health issue is not sociopathy, but something like down&#x27;s syndrome, it&#x27;s basically impossible to get a sympathetic jury, despite the fact that it&#x27;s supposed to be a &quot;jury of peers.&quot;<p>We really need mental health courts. We need to recognize, like we did with drug courts, that some of these cases just aren&#x27;t a normal criminal justice issue. They have their own special issues that require a special set of expertise and special policy options. We also need mental health facilities or in home monitoring to handle the problem.<p>That all means massive amounts of money, but it would be money well spent on social justice, and some costs would even be recouped by lowering the burden on the rest of the system, which is an ill fit for this social problem.<p>On the other hand, there&#x27;s only so far you can go with this. The Supreme Court has found that prisoners have a right to refuse treatment (with certain exceptions), and many do. Other violent offenders don&#x27;t have any particular mental illness, just take every opportunity to defy prison rules. Some prison rules are arbitrary, but some aren&#x27;t.<p>I still think guards need a robust range of tools at their disposal to control behavior, but I&#x27;d be all for much greater oversight and access to appellate review of disciplinary decisions. I&#x27;m glad cops in California are experimenting with body cameras, maybe guards will start being required to wear them too. Less wrongful liability for the prison, less behind the scenes violence against inmates, maybe everyone wins.",1395705626

7075445,comment,7075228,7075228,57,0,dredmorbius,,,"The question&#x27;s been asked &quot;can a company die without an obvious challenger?&quot;  Yes, it can.<p>A company, platform, or technology can &quot;die&quot; in the sense that it loses the initiative, and more importantly, the ability to drive an industry and/or conversation, even though it hasn&#x27;t yet died.<p>Apple was &quot;dead&quot; through most of the 1990s.  It simply didn&#x27;t matter, outside of the graphics and design areas, and for a very small cadre of fervent fans.  The turnaround shocked me.<p>IBM very nearly died in the early 1990s, as its place as the center of the business computing world was shaken by anti-trust actions, Microsoft, and the upsurge in Unix vendors.  The company&#x27;s never fully regained its former footing, though it did recover largely.<p>Microsoft has been in the process of dying for most of the past decade.  A highly symbolic moment for me was when <i>The Economist</i> newspaper ran a cover showing the leaders in tech:  Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon.  Microsoft wasn&#x27;t even mentioned (it reminds me of an earlier revealing moment when the CEO of Visa International named the company&#x27;s biggest rivals:  MasterCard, AmEx, and Microsoft -- I guess it didn&#x27;t pay to Discover...).<p>Sun Microsystems was fingered for the walking dead as Linux became ascendant, with its acquisition by Oracle (a panic response of both companies, coming at least five years too late to do either any good) coming long after it was obvious the company had not only staggered but was mortally wounded.<p>One thing to realize is that a fading icon is often not replaced by a direct competitor, but by one which addresses short<p>Facebook has dominated Silicon Valley for the past 5 years, stealing initiative from Google (who seems to be somewhat winning it back).  Part of the situation is that &quot;traditional&quot; social networking is becoming passe, in part because it&#x27;s become too Byzantine, and too intrusive.  Social networks -- <i>real</i> social networks, not the online instantiations of them -- work best when the groups are relatively small, Dunbar&#x27;s number is respected, and there&#x27;s a level of insularity around any given group.  TheFacebook at Harvard had those features.  Facebook, Inc., 1 billion served, doesn&#x27;t, and cannot.  Another secret is that one of the secret sauces of social is photo sharing (still hard if you don&#x27;t have your own dedicated server), and that services are sprouting up to offer this (Imgur, Snapchat, etc.), which is essentially disrupting the former Social glue much the way Craigslist gutted classified newspaper advertising in the late 1990s.<p>I&#x27;d like to think that the constant drumbeat of surveillance state revelations we can thank heros and patriots Edward Snowden, Laura Poitras, and Glen Greenwald for are having an effect, though I think that may be giving the general public a bit too much credit.  Not totally sure of that though.",1389962637

But there is some research that suggests that limiting membership to certain groups does make members of that group more likely to participate[1][3]. It sounds counter-intuitive to me, but the research and examples are there.<p>I agree that in an ideal world, we would simply find the idea of &quot;girls who code&quot; equally weird as the idea of &quot;girls who breathe&quot;<p>But the unfortunate truth is, there <i>is</i> a gender gap in programming. Its very real - we all know the stats. There is a reason for this gap, and it very likely has something to do with our society, culture, and us. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;d like to find out more about what those reasons are, and if there is something I can do to change that, I would. Why not? It would be great!<p>The one thing I disagree about is that angry attacks or lynch mobs are a good strategy to go about this. Most male programmers are highly intelligent individuals - if the reasoning behind an idea is explained to them in a calm and logical manner, I believe they will be very likely to accept the explanation. In contrast, if the explanation or actions are interpreted as a personal attack, they may feel threatened and will be more likely to just attempt to defend themselves. Because they would be afraid of being personally accused, shamed and socially cast out.<p>Even ideas such as privilege blindness can be explained in this manner - articles such as [2] and [3] are good examples (I&#x27;d guess that the pattern is that a personal story is more likely to produce good results)<p>[1]: <a href""http://www.singlesexschools.org/evidence.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.singlesexschools.org/evidence.html</a><p>[2]: <a href""http://pgbovine.net/tech-privilege.ht"" rel""nofollo"">http://pgbovine.net/tech-privilege.htm</a><p>[3]: <a href""https://medium.com/tales-from-the-front/cc9ed433ec3"" rel""nofollo"">https://medium.com/tales-from-the-front/cc9ed433ec3c</a>",1389961532

I came back to help out on a project recently and had to spend a day researching all the new tools. Particularly around package management, bower, grunt, yeoman, node, npm etc. A year ago a js lib was generally delivered as a js or min.js file. Now there&#x27;s the whole system to sit around it; every project on github now seems to include the config for each of the different package managers. Even a vagrant file so you can get it all up and running on a brand new vm.<p>Something as simple as adding bootstrap to a project. It&#x27;s not totally obvious when you first look at it. Where does the code go? How do you compile it in such a way that you don&#x27;t touch the vendor src itself but you can customise it etc. I have a method that works for me, but I had to play around a little to figure out how to fit it to my needs.<p>Once I got through that stage I was really happy with where things were at. JS libs are nice and easy to install and version control now, dependency management with bower has worked really well for me so far. Grunt makes the automation side of development nice, contained and easily shared. All in all it&#x27;s a really good transition.<p>I&#x27;m lucky in that I&#x27;ve been developing for the web since people were changing files in ultraedit and ftping to the live server to see the changes. When each new thing comes along I only have one new thing to learn. Step away for a year and suddenly there&#x27;s a lot to figure out to get back in to it.<p>I can only imagine how daunting it could be for a complete newbie trying to find their way.<p>As ever these tools can be great, but you ultimately you really want to understand what goes on underneath so they don&#x27;t limit you too much.

The only explanation I can come up with is that the zero and one values represent a lower and higher voltage in the cable and in the sender or receiver. This is actually an analogue signal when we look at it on a scope. We audiophiles agree that cables sound different with analogue signals, so why not with Ethernet data? Next, any interface for Ethernet has a correction circuit for errors. With many errors this interface has to work hard, that will result in a greater need for current from the power supply and the processor heating up. A bad cable, or one that easily picks up interference, introduces a lot of errors so that might be the cause of a change in sound quality. &quot;<p>An audiophile and his money are soon parted it seems.",1389960707

Jitter is also introduced by the communication that goes on in parallel. As the Ethernet cable has no influence on the data itself (bit flips are covered by the CRC) there can be no influence at the higher layers at.

The Flipper takes away the random luck factor and distributes goods to those who can best utilize them.<p>Consider an iPad 1 listed for $10 on Craigslist by someone who just wants it gone. Almost anyone would buy just for the heck of it and take it away from the market even if they already have iPad Air and 3 other Android tablets gathering dust at home.<p>However, if the Flipper buys it and puts it back on the market at say $100, the person buying from the Flipper will actually have to think before making such a purchase.<p>So a reasonable Flipper adds liquidity and stability to the market. Unreasonable Flipper (one either putting prices too high or too low) does not stay in business for too long.",1389960032

When looking at realtime can you rewind or scroll the realtime chart backwards in time?<p>Fourth: When visiting a new web site I tend to be brutal - if I don't ""get"" the site within the first 5-10 seconds I move on.

In Java, you typically have some classes which have to be thread-safe (having no per-request state) and others which are instantiated per request. Developers have to be aware of the distinction, and to code accordingly. I fell into this trap when submitting a change to JBoss back in 2000; Rickard Oberg picked it up within hours (the diffs of all committed changes went out to everyone on the developer mailing list).

We would all love to see these great ideas be practiced but it isn't going to happen by Stallman's total and complete unwillingness not only to compromise but to even acknowledge that we all don't have the luxury of being able to GPL 100% of our code. And maybe he's wrong. Software is a tool. It is something we pay for because it gives us the power to get something valuable done. The majority of people don't care how the computer or it's software works. They just want to get work done. I drive a car or take a plan or ride a bus and I pay because it gets me where I need to go to often times make more money. I don't care how it works, just that it does. It seems Stallman's entire FOSS movement assumes that either everyone is or will be a coder or power user and that those who aren't want to be. The reality is that they don't. Programming is hard. Sure anyone can learn but to make anything truly worthwhile you have be smart. The being smart comment won't go down well with many but think about it, it's very true. If you apply the FOSS principles to other things like construction or car manufacturing or anything else it just falls apart. Sure, the tools are freely available but but will everyone start building their own? Will people build extras to just give away? No. You pay for convenience and happily so. Some companies do operate in ways that restrict freedom more than what we can all agree they should but I'd say we already have freedom. I like the capitalist way of software development and distribution because its survival of the best software that's right for the most users. The Stallman socialist way results in software that us programmers can use easily but will be considered hard to use and crappy by the masses. I benefit from free software all the time. Free software that I run on my proprietary, OS X running computer. I can honestly say that I benefit most from proprietary software. I use the free stuff for applications it is well suited for too and at the end of the day both FOSS and proprietary software have their merits. Honestly, if FOSS was so awesome it would have greater market share. I mean, come on, it's free!",1320112079

You can share stories with your sports buddies, work relevant info with your coworkers, local stuff with people in your area. Before, you were limited to a very niche group. Now, you can share with people who never even heard of Google Reader or RSS. And if you wanted, you could make an old Google Reader power readers circle.

Trying to entice them off of Python onto Ruby is a waste of time for everybody. The Ruby community would at best get nothing, at worst net pain of supporting a lot of newbies, and the scientists would incur the horrifying overhead of a language shift for the closest thing to a sidegrade available in the set of the top 20-ish language. If they were going to do that they probably shouldn't be going for Ruby, they should probably be going for Haskell or OCaml, both languages for which I could outline actual advantages to the scientists for the pain of the switch (though probably not enough to justify the switch).",1320110486

With the removal of the inbox-style interface, if you miss a friend's shared item on Google Plus (possibly buried in other items), it's gone.

I'd like to keep a little bit ahead of the curve, and possibly contribute if there's still low-hanging fruit...<p>EDIT: And it's not like I expect anything to work in a prerelease either.

The dvd player doesn't work under windows, so i boot to mac to watch movies and such, but I always go back to windows.<p>Under Mac, I don't like the way the mouse moves.  I don't like the window resizing. I don't like that I can't maximize a window.  I don't like it isn't really all that stable. I get the spinny rainbow wheel.  I've seen other people's macs lock up in the middle of a presentation.  I find the mac constricting.<p>You may disagree with me, which is fine.  But to say that people use windows because they are forced to isn't true.  I use windows because I prefer it. Maybe it's just familiar.  I dunno.  I started out on Apple IIe's decades ago, but I don't really have a problem with windows.  I think most microsoft issues are religious.  When you add up the hardware and the software for a PC, they're much cheaper than macs.  The hardware is nice, but I probably won't buy another one for myself.<p>EDIT:  I do wonder sometimes if I'm ""holding myself back"" by not learning another environment. I do understand the advantages to *nix and another reason I bought the mac was the underlying kernel for the OS.  Perhaps I just got locked in.  I don't find it unsettling though.",1264776883

The next time I'm looking for a job, I'll try this:<p>""Most Illustrious Proprietor, Having now sufficiently considered the specimens of all those who proclaim themselves skilled developers of applications of business, and that the invention and operation of the said programs are nothing different from those in common use: I shall endeavor, without prejudice to any one else, to explain myself to your Company, showing your Management my secret, and then offering them to your best pleasure and approbation to work with effect at opportune moments on all those things which, in part, shall be briefly noted below.<p>1. I have a sort of extremely light and strong functions and modules, adapted to be most easily ftp'd, and with them you may pursue, and at any time combine them with others, secure and indestructible by standard mean time to failure of hardware and denial of service, easy and convenient to compile and catalog. Also methods of unzipping and storing the data of the customers.<p>2. I know how, when a website is besieged, to shard data onto the cloud, and make endless variety of mirrors, and fault tolerant disks and RAIDs, and other machines pertaining to such concerns.<p>3. If, by reason of the volume of the data, or the structure of the btrees and its indexes, it is impossible, when conducting a search, to avail oneself of sub-second response time, I have methods for benchmarking every process or other function, even if it were interpreted, etc.<p>4. Again, I have kinds of functions; most convenient and easy to ftp; and with these I can spawn lots of data almost resembling a torrent; and with the download of these cause great terror to the competitor, to his great detriment and confusion.<p>5. And if the processing should be on the desktop I have apps of many machines most efficient for data entry and reporting; and utilities which will satisfy the needs of the most demanding customers and users and consumers.<p>6. I have means by secret and tortuous scripts and modules, made without leaving tracks, to generate source code, even if it were needed to run on a client or a server.<p>7. I will make secure firewalls, safe and unattackable, which, entering among the hackers with their utilities, there is no body of crackers so great but they would break them. And behind these, software could run quite unhurt and without any hindrance.<p>8. In case of need I will make big properties, methods, and collections and useful forms, out of the common type.<p>9. Where the operation of compiling might fail, I would contrive scripts, functions, routines, and other parameter driven processes of marvellous efficacy and not in common use. And in short, according to the variety of cases, I can contrive various and endless means of data entry, reporting, and storage.<p>10. In times of low revenue I believe I can give perfect satisfaction and to the equal of any other in maintenance and the refactoring of code public and private; and in guiding data from one warehouse to another.<p>11. I can carry out code in Javascript, PHP, or C, and also I can do in network administration whatever may be done, as well as any other, be he who he may.<p>Again, the intranet app may be taken in hand, which is to be to the immortal glory and eternal honor of all your customers of happy memory, and of the illustrious house of Google.<p>And if any of the above-named things seem to anyone to be impossible or not feasible, I am most ready to make the experiment in your data center, or in whatever place may please your Businessperson - to whom I comment myself with the utmost humility, etc.""",1264776857

The end is near when you can bootstrap a new iPad application on an iPad.

Those can soak up your attention, but you can also set them down pretty quickly to get up and open the door.  The mode switch isn't such a large overhead.  So these interfaces blend in more harmoniously with everyday life.<p>But for programming, a workstation is <i>great</i>!

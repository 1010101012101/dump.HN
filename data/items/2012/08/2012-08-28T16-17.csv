It's better to travel with a local (you probably have relatives there) and not to speak at all - even if your accent is flawless, your vernacular and fluidity is probably subtly off <i>just</i> enough to tip them off.

It was all bullshit but you were expected to do it.<p>Over time, that exercise in fiction loosened up. Investors became more interested in if you really understood your product, your market, and what it was going to take to bring your product to that market. Demonstrations of sufficient competency, adaptivity, and intelligence were required but investors only demanded documentation of things you could actually say something meaningful about.<p>Somewhere along the way, more VCs became obsessed with shiny clicky demos (nominally, ""product"") above all else, often to the exclusion of any substantial discussion of the actual business and market strategy. This demo obsession is a form of mitigating execution risk but it is far from the only kind of risk in a startup and often the other risks are being ignored when this happens. The startup world is a market, supply and demand. Wannabe startups are providing what many VCs are demanding; Bryce may or may not be one of the VCs encouraging it but he swims in a market where many VCs are. Many people who should not be doing a startup think they can because plenty of VCs will actually consider their half-assed ideas.<p>It falls on both the VCs and startup founders. VCs need to stop acting as though a shiny demo trumps all other funding considerations and startup founders need to stop acting as though you can put serious effort into the business parts later as long as you have a vague idea and a shiny demo.",1346172361

A 'police state' with effectively no authority or power is hardly a police state, at least the way we usually use the term).

Thankfully the private security guard for the house next door was able to convince the private construction workers down the street to put it out, because the fire department took almost an hour to get there.

It appears that something like this could <i>look</i> like Dropbox to everyone disinterested in vcs and act like Git to everyone else who cares.<p>2.

You're right, for children, it isn't simple calorie arithmetic.<p>That said, how disparate are the ""differing amounts"" they eat? Are they identical twins or fraternal? Lifestyle differences? There are a lot of factors that could produce the effects you're seeing besides ""calorie arithmetic doesn't work"".<p>The essence of telling people ""calories in - calories out"" is to favor a simple (i.e. ""easily applied"") rule over an absolutely correct one. While people are growing, the equation changes. Get all of your calories in the form of twinkies and your body doesn't get the nutrients it needs to process food, so the equation changes. Assume ""normal"" ranges for diet and exercise and it more or less works.<p>This is a fantastically complicated topic, but it is not immune to human nature. We like simple rules that generally work, even if they're full of loopholes and caveats. For people that are overweight or even obese, calories in - calories out is good enough to get started.

The difficulty of keeping corruption at a low level, even for such a 'benevolent' task of rebuilding a country should be clear from how badly Iraqi reconstruction went.

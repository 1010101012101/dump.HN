Why would they want an overpriced Mac for doing that?<p>That's partly the reason why I once thought that Linux will overtake the market, because of its price. But apparently there are other forces that keep Windows dominating, like familiarity and compatibility with existing apps (your free or shiny OS doesn't mean shit if I can't run my apps on it).<p>> <i>'Mac is back' by Paul Graham</i><p>I'm pretty sure Paul Graham got disappointing with Apple by now.

You've taken previously private profile information and pre-emptively linked it to these public categories.  Even where some of this information was previously publicly visible, it wasn't so conveniently publicly indexed; someone would have to visit individual profiles in order to turn it up.<p>By the way, religious and political views do not only express themselves in the fields you mention.  What disrespectful soul there decided to take my ""Favorite Quotes"", with access previously restricted to ""Only Friends"", and plaster them -- without so much as a warning -- all over my public profile?<p>I've been pretty cautious, and there was nothing very incendiary or damaging in them, but it still caught me out.<p>For me, it was the last straw.  I hope FB, or at least its current Management and, ahem, ""policies"", follows MySpace into a death spiral, taking their accumulated financial equity with them before they have a chance to cash out.<p>I hope HN will pardon a bit of unusual vehemence from me, but Facebook has come to be, simply stated, slimy.  I guess I write this comment in the vague hope some fraction of the message might get through whatever reality distortion field they're currently running in-house.<p>Finally, as a few commentors have started to point out, as Facebook continues to publicize their members' data, those members more and more tightly control their expression.  The result is that the site continues to become blander and blander, less and less ""personal"".  There's only so long people will continue to find novelty and interest in generic updates.<p>Control over privacy.  Personal expression.  What brand-building feature are you going to kill off, next?<p>I remember when ""everyone"" was on AIM.  Even if you preferred another platform, you used AIM because that's where the bulk of the general (U.S.) population was, for IM; they'd ""won"" the IM platform war.  I don't think I've even signed on to the thing in a year or more.<p>A lesson for any ""winner"".<p>P.S.  As for fanning being public, it used to be someone would have to seek your ID out on those different fan pages.  Then, around the end of the year, Facebook decided to (pre-emptively, again) display that information in aggregate for each user on their public profile.  Maybe googling might have exposed some or all of it previously, but you sure made it a lot more convenient.  (E.g. for that HR staffer looking for a quick means to winnow a stack of resumes.)  And I'm not even addressing the publication of everyone's friends, etc.<p>If you've read this far, thanks for taking the time to consider my response.  It's not meant to be personal.  (Well, except against those setting these policies at Facebook.  Even then, it's the policies that elicit the response; the people I don't know personally.)

And even that only got a 6-3 vote, with 3 members of the court thinking the classification was <i>so</i> plainly erroneous that it shouldn't survive even a deferential review. And one of the six who did vote to give its rule deference, Breyer, admitted it might be ""just barely"" plausible enough to pass.

The housing bubble had just burst, unemployment had shot up, etc. If you had allowed GM to go under in those conditions you would likely be facing a full-on depression in places like Michigan. So the reasons for this bailout weren't all political. At least in the case of the GM bailout the taxpayers got something in return for their money - they got control of the companies, which wasn't even an option politicians were willing to discuss during the bank bailouts.<p>Yes, GM's arrogance is frustrating, but in this case the people are in a position to do something about it if they felt strongly enough. You are the majority stock owners at GM - write your senator and make sure GM's behavior is aligned with your interests. One thing I would suggest is pushing for GM to be heavily involved in the expansion of the US railroad system - something that will happen, but is currently a job that's mostly going to be shipped out to companies in Spain.

That is, if your resume is currently something like 3 years at one company, then 9 months at the current place, I wouldn't look askance at that, but I'd be sure I want to stay at the next place for a while before leaving. 3 years, 9 months, 1 year and then looking again does look a little flaky.<p>I suspect the ""job hoppers are flakes"" bandwagon includes a lot of people with big stakes in companies that need willing worker bees. If you get a better offer, jump on it. If you keep getting better offers, keep jumping on them.",1273126426

When I applied to colleges in 2000, the mere fact that I was active in Internet Stuff helped me, as far as I can tell (I ran a fan site and mailing list for a semi-popular band that I liked).<p>The bigger question is probably whether there are tradeoffs that should be balanced differently. Between a student with perfect grades and top test scores <i>and</i> some online projects, and one with just the good grades/scores, the one with the online projects wins. But what about a student with perfect grades/scores versus one with a B average and some online projects? That's probably where elite schools start being less interested in people who aren't at the very top academically but might make good entrepreneurs.",1273126352

1323701,comment,1323064,1323452,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I don't really have a strong preference either way.  The bulk of my professional work is in JavaScript with a fair amount of Python and C++ thrown in.  I dislike the C++, but that's probably because the type system is brain dead rather than because the type system is static.  I do most of my hobby hacking in Haskell, which has about the strongest type system imaginable.  I'm hacking on a programming language of my own design, which will have static typing, but not to catch errors.  I want static type inferencing because it lets the compiler generate usable, machine-checked, cross-referenced, auto-updating <i>documentation</i> from my source code, without having to update this myself.<p>I've found that I rarely have type errors in dynamically typed languages, <i>as long as I program as if they were statically typed</i>.  For example, if my JS function <i>only</i> takes strings or objects with certain fields, I just document those and I almost never make mistakes with them.  However, if I start defining functions that return string|int|bool, <i>then</i> I start getting confused.  Do this often enough and it becomes essentially impossible to reason about my program.<p>Ironically, I've found that a good portion of my bugs in statically typed languages are type errors, in the form of null pointer exceptions.  Haskell's Maybe type is the way to go here; yeah, it makes looking things up in a dict inconvenient, but I can't count the number of bugs I've avoided by being forced to deal with nulls up-front and not having them pollute the rest of the program.",1273125965

It's easy to test the code your changing, it's a much harder problem to find and test all the code that depends on that code.  Having the compiler spit out every instance everywhere that you need to fix due to a new type-mismatch makes this significantly easier.<p>Some dynamic languages will happily convert values from one type to another even when that's not the desired result -- you might not get an error at all, just some bad data you might not find until much later.",1273125924

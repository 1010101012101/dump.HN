Either its not sunny enough (sudden cloud formations, bad weather) for solar panels or the wind calms so that wind turbines don&#x27;t work.\nAnother issue is location, in my country (Germany) we have wind parks in the northern regions but the providers are having difficulties directing the power to where it&#x27;s needed [citation needed].",1409461191

(To be fair, newer reactor designs don&#x27;t need backup power to cool the reactor after a shutdown; but those designs didn&#x27;t exist when Fukushima was built.)<p>Nuclear waste disposal is only a problem if you refuse to reprocess the waste, which only the United States has done among all nuclear-using countries (because of misplaced concerns about proliferation; other countries have been reprocessing for decades and there have been no incidents).<p>Finally, if you&#x27;re going to be fair in assessing nuclear power, you have to compare the overall cost of nuclear power with the overall cost of other forms of base load power generation. You have to look at the damage done by coal mining, coal ash and soot (not to mention radioactivity in coal ash, which is actually worse than many forms of nuclear waste), oil spills, fracking for natural gas, etc.",1409461119

8248461,comment,8248300,8248421,3,0,tsomctl,,,"3 Mile Island was not a catastrophe, although it could have been. The reason for this is arguably the high standard of engineering. The safety systems worked to contain almost everything. Chernobyl was an outdated design when it was built, today it is a really outdated design. In addition, Soviet bureaucracy prevented people from being properly informed what was happening and evacuating. Fukishima was a disappointment, I normally have a huge amount of respect for Japanese engineering. One way to solve it is to not locate nuclear reactors near seismic activity. (In the case of Japan, they have to. They aren&#x27;t going to build them in another country, and all of Japan is vulnerable to seismic activity and tsunamis.) Very high voltage power transmission is feasible, and will only get better as silicon fabs increase. It also likely that we will have some energy dense liquid like gasoline/ethanol that is produced easily from electricity, and can be shipped anywhere. Hydrogen is not realistic.<p>I&#x27;d say we have figured out the engineering more than you claim.",1409461058

8248451,comment,8248300,8248421,2,0,tomphoolery,,,"The cost of a nuclear power plant is pretty high, but not because of the dangers. Rather, the expensive part is inherent with all reactors, and has to do with how it is constructed. IIRC, Nuclear reactors need a few years to &quot;warm up&quot; before they begin producing power, so you basically have to pay people to work on (and in) the reactor all the while knowing that they won&#x27;t be producing anything that can make you money. In short, a big reactor is a very expensive investment, but eventually it pays off.<p>I&#x27;d say 3 incidents in the almost 50 years of solid nuclear power usage is a pretty good track record. These incidents were also relatively &quot;contained&quot;, that is, their meltdowns didn&#x27;t trigger worldwide environmental catastrophe, or even a catastrophe inside their own countries.",1409460776

You want to use government funding to build nuclear plants. My response: please look at previous government-funded nuclear operations of all types. It appears this doesn&#x27;t work, from a failure to manage the environmental impact to a failure to keep the project cost-effective. This includes state-controlled energy companies, since nuclear power is a very tightly controlled business.<p>2. You want to use an unproven technology. My response: there are several well-proven nuclear options that are being developed by very promising companies. Please compare your technology with them. Some of the promising technologies are government-funded, however, which seems like a waste of a good idea.<p>3. You want to keep existing plants alive. This is nuanced. Some existing nuclear plants are necessary, but hopefully we can shut down the aging and dangerous and high-level-waste-producing ones in favor of cleaner alternatives. Doing so shouldn&#x27;t necessarily cost a lot of money.<p>4. You want to reprocess existing nuclear waste and burn it to low-grade waste while generating clean electricity. My response: if you can show that you&#x27;ve cleared the regulatory hurdles (a lot of waste is held by governments) and if you&#x27;re reasonably transparent about your progress, I&#x27;d like to give you a donation.",1409459201

But as protection against <i>intentional</i> changes it&#x27;s quite useless. That&#x27;s what cryptographic hash functions are for.<p>Now the proposal described using a &quot;checksum&quot; to tie together two halves of a self-signature, where one half would be a an identity and the second would be an email address, essentially. That would make it trivial to forge a second half with another email address (but the same &quot;checksum&quot;).<p>I understand that&#x27;s an entirely different problem.

I&#x27;m not trying to be difficult, but mathematicians often try and live in their happy axiomatic universe and forget the axioms come from somewhere. Naïve mathematicians go further and forget that the axioms are aesthetic objects of mathematical culture and can and do change. I&#x27;m not a statistician, but like physics is to mathematics, statistics is to probability theory, and questioning the nature of the model as it corresponds to reality is part of the discipline. You can prove all the consequences you want from the axioms, but it&#x27;ll never get you to closer to appreciating the relationship of those axioms and their results to an extra-theoretic &quot;reality&quot;.<p>Take Buffon&#x27;s needle (only chosen because is interesting, and continuous, as opposed to discrete). Consider this in the real world. X = needle crosses line. You haven&#x27;t dropped it yet. Is X real, how so? How does it differ from before you dropped the needle to afterwards? Deterministically X is something except that you don&#x27;t know it, and suddenly you know it. In so far as that is the case, what is a reasonable way to speak about knowledge of X? For the frequentist the model <i>is</i> reality, i.e. you construct your sigma algebra, apply geometric arguments, crunch away, and you start glowing when you see π. What happens when you&#x27;re not so sure about the model? In other words, the mathematics is always fine, but the reasoning behind the use of the mathematics is what is up for debate.",1409458574

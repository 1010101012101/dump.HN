It did at least occur to him that the two most successful web startups to date, Google and Yahoo, both did what he says startups shouldn't.  He replies to that by saying that you can only get away with a goofy name if people love what you build.  <p>If he had followed that line of reasoning one step further, it might also have occurred to him that, conversely, if you make something users hate, it won't matter that you have a good name.  <p>In other words, what matters is what you build, not what you call it.  Names just don't matter much.  Which means he's wrong, since the thesis of this article is that they do.<p>Startups choosing random names are in fact pursuing a near optimal strategy: just choose something reasonably short and catchy, and spend your time working on the product, because that's what matters.",1196967272

86729,comment,86721,86721,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Why is this an either-or question?  They're both factors, but probably minimal compared to simple economics.  Small businesses are experiments, and big companies are experiments so successful that they've become formulas.  Big chains know their business, demographic requirements, and financial projections so well that they can determine before hand whether they will succeed in a given area.  This is also why you rarely see them fail or fold.  <p>Imagine starting a startup if you had to compete directly with companies that already knew how to win the game you're learning.  Internet/software startups give you so much more advantage because you can play an entirely different game that big companies aren't suited to.  ",1196966610

86724,comment,86688,86688,0,0,kajecounterhack,,,"@jey: doesn't that mean that the back button isn't an undo button? Those ""finer grained edits"" are undos. Navigating from page to page is what the back button is about, and thats why well written ajax apps (like gmail) allow the back button to navigate through various elements of a page (inbox, spam...etc)<p>Or does it? It used to just load your page to the inbox when you hit back cause the pages were built into the ajax app. It shouldn't do that because that limits the actual use of the back button.",1196965972

Beacon will no longer collect data sent to facebook by vendors if you opt-out. thus, they will not continue to collect your data as they have in the past.",1196965036

You need to figure out which actions in your application intuitively correspond to the ""back"" operation, and make the back button actually do that. Undo could be for a finer grained edits, like edits within a certain ""page"" of your app.<p>Seet the new GMail for a perfect example of how it should be done.",1196964377

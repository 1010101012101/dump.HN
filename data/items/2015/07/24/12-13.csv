Unfortunately, this is likely prophetic of the way people within Accenture will misunderstand this too.<p>Most of the grievances in comments here at this point are not so much about the feedback system as about the pay system. There is no mention in the article of &quot;pay&quot;, &quot;compensation&quot;, &quot;salary&quot;, &quot;reward&quot;, or any other word talking about the pay system.

This is not mentioned explicitly in the C language standard, but it follows as a corollary from point 6.5.2.2.5 of the language standard:<p>> One special guarantee is made in order to simplify the use of unions: if a union containsseveral structures that share a common initial sequence (see below), and if the unionobject currently contains one of these structures, it is permitted to inspect the commoninitial part of any of them anywhere that a declaration of the complete type of the union isvisible.  Two structures share acommon initial sequenceif corresponding members havecompatible types (and, for bit-fields, the same widths) for a sequence of one or moreinitial members.<p>Consider<p>a.h<p><pre><code>    struct a { char aye; short bee; int cee; long dee; };\n</code></pre>\na.c<p><pre><code>    #include &quot;a.h&quot;\n    int aye(struct a a) { return a.aye; }\n</code></pre>\nb.h<p><pre><code>    struct b { char aye; short bee; int cee; long dee; double eee; };\n</code></pre>\nb.c<p><pre><code>    #include &quot;b.h&quot;\n    int bee(struct b b) { return b.bee; }\n</code></pre>\nNow if we add c.h<p><pre><code>    #include &quot;a.h&quot;\n    #include &quot;b.h&quot;\n\n    union ab {\n        struct a a;\n        struct b b;\n    };\n</code></pre>\nThe language standard warrants, that the common initial sequence of both structures can be used interchangeably in that union. Since however compilation units a.c and b.c are processed individually without knowledge of union ab this enforces the compiler to use the same memory layout for an initial sequence of member elements for either struct. Hence it is legal to extend structs without out altering the memory layout of the previous elements.",1437740496

I generally put everything into a single group. When I am finished, I just take that group&#x27;s folder and add it to my components/ folder of my project. I then do all the functionality in my text editor (Sublime).<p>A few caveats to keep in mind:<p>- I filed issue #24 on Git which you fixed, thank you - very helpful. I have react-ui-builder running on an ec2 instance so I can switch to it between computers and do not have to worry about running the server locally.<p>- I am a data scientist/statistician (both in my job role and by training), however, I build internal applications for all sorts of visualizations/dashboard monitoring purposes.

It would be helpful to have an equivalent &#x27;get wrapped&#x27; button (ie. insert child).<p>- The up/down arrows for moving components work well as does the &#x27;move cursor one parent up&#x27;.

On many of the occasions in the past when I&#x27;ve given meaningful feedback... despite the &quot;anonymity&quot;, that feedback has been repeated to me verbatim by a manager in later conversations.  Often in a passive-aggressively angry or intimidating way.<p>It&#x27;s a problem of population size.  For company survey data to be all that meaningful, you have to AT LEAST segment the &quot;anonymous&quot; responses by location, group, etc.  So even if the text doesn&#x27;t include your individual name... it still narrows your identity down to a couple dozen people in a HUGE company, and probably just 2 or 3 people in a small company.<p>With that small of a population, it&#x27;s really not that hard for managers to piece together who said what.  My experience is that when management receives feedback they&#x27;d rather not hear, often they REALLY do want to piece together who said what.  So whatever your noble intentions are in creating an &quot;anonymous&quot; survey system, I believe that human nature works against you on this.  You&#x27;re really just creating a honeypot trap to help root out &quot;negative influencers&quot;.<p>Talk to your people.  I know that a lot of employees roll their eyes at regular &quot;1-on-1&#x27;s&quot;, and a lot of managers don&#x27;t like doing them either (so they&#x27;re often not done very well).  However, I just can&#x27;t comprehend how anyone could consider themselves an effective manager without having those with every direct report on at least a bi-weekly basis, preferably weekly.  If you&#x27;re doing those right, then you&#x27;ll have a strong relationship within your team even if everyone doesn&#x27;t always see eye to eye.<p>Of course, 1-on-1&#x27;s and manager-employee communication at the team level is a separate matter from COMPANY WIDE feedback.  Upper management can (and usually does) have blind spots due to information getting blocked by poor managers in between them and staff.  If you have a solution for bad managers, or for bad organizational structures that leave employees with either multiple managers or none at all, then you&#x27;d be a messiah.  Generally, that&#x27;s the last thing in the world that upper management really wants to tackle, though.",1437739516

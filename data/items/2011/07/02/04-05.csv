For those who we didn't, though, here's a quick overview:<p>Popstar Defense is a multiplayer, social game in the tower defense genre: You're a rockstar! But undead zombie popstars have returned from the grave to steal your show ~~ Only your loyal fans can save you now. (Chrome only, ALPHA):http://popstardefense.com (play code is iohtml5).<p>The tower defense engine we built is one of the most technically complex projects I've worked on in javascript. It uses deterministic physics to run the simulation and keep all clients in sync. It also runs on iOS, Android, and normal web browsers.<p>Now we need to turn this into a real game with a story, levels, balanced enemies and allies, and the whole nine yards. Are there any hackers out there who have a zany enough humor to pick this up and run with it, and know javascript well enough to tweak the engine and build out levels and content?<p>We're willing to pay all transportation and housing, and we can compensate you very well for 8 weeks of work.

When you post something, you choose which circles are allowed to see it (or you could choose individual people, or ""Public"").<p>On the flip side, your circles inform your incoming news stream. By putting someone in any of your circles, you basically say, ""I could be interested in what they say.""<p>What appears in your stream, then, are posts in the intersection of the two: from someone in one of your circles, and to a circle of theirs that they put you in.<p>So to answer your original question: Google+ can operate in the Twitter modality exactly. You put someone in any circle (""Following"", by convention), and then any posts they make to ""Public"" will appear in your stream. The difference is that the person you're following doesn't have to direct all his posts to ""Public"". He or she could send some to specific groups of people, which you wouldn't receive.",1309581473

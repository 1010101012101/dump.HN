At best a DVCS can remove barriers to productivity.<p>I think this is an example of people fussing over things they can understand and control, to avoid facing up to the harder problems they have on a day to day basis.<p>Like that story of the design of a new nuclear reactor - everyone was afraid to commit to things, to comment and collaborate on things that were hard, but when the subject of a handrail around the reactor was brought up, suddenly there was a deluge of opinion on it - it was something people could understand and feel like they were contributing.<p>Often the debates over the less significant problems are the most heated.",1209595981

I think Analytics is good for the business-types who want to use stats in their reports, but even though there's some nice features for developers, such as detecting screen resolution and browser type, it's not all that helpful tracking, say, which user is viewing what. AWStats I like too, but it can be a pain to get the trends in an Analytics fashion.<p>So far I've found the best solution is to build whatever important trends you want to track (ie. which readers have viewed what article) as part of your app, include Analytics anyway (it's no effort at all to add), and for any serious number crunching take a snapshot of your database to do some calculations from (off server).<p>Really though, if someone has a good Rails solution, they should build a plugin :)",1209594482

That doesn't mean your site is a bad idea, just that you need to find different ways to get the word about your site out to your target users/customers.

Its a great way to study groups and to begin the comparison between group 1 and group 2 or YC vs. non YC.  It should help build a case that getting into YC might improve your chance of success by say 10% or 50%.  A lot of what pg talks about is how he feels that YC will improve your chance of success by more than 6%.  I think at this point pg could present a fairly empirical case to prove that.  I sense that many of us believe that to be true, but I have talked to some ex-startup vets here in Wisconsin who are not so convinced and others that are.

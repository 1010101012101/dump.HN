It feels like there is tons of stuff there, but at the same time, it doesn't feel like I'm getting what I need. One person mentioned events, and that's one of the things that's missing, but there is more.<p>I don't think this new design entices you to venture on to your friends or groups. Where do I go if I want to send a message (not status)? What about posting a link?\nAgain, i'm sure there's more.<p>Facebook needs to understand they have great value without twitter. The feed is a great thing, but not everything.",1236988726

That would be like finding penmanship or grammar inherently interesting.<p>I predict that in a few decades people will look back in bewilderment at today's computer science with its focus on implementation.<p>And btw, it's also surprising when people are upset that few women major in CS.  The problem is that the field isn't interesting in its current form.  Perhaps one should complain more about men who like the field as is and want to preserve the status quo!",1236988621

If you're scaling out and caching because you're CPU limited then nothing changes.

It is hard to prove intent. I could say ""ACME sucks"" because I honestly believe ACME sucks, or I could say they suck because I want to short their price. It is tricky business. Who is to say he broke the law if in fact he talked down a company? Maybe he was just giving his honest opinion and was not trying to trade in the stock himself. Intent is always a tricky thing, especially when it comes to securities fraud issues. (Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, the above are just my gut thoughts!)",1236985408

8454379,comment,8454379,8453144,0,0,CapitalistCartr,,,"I had gallstones a few years ago.  They are intensely painful.  At first I chalked it up to bad food.  The second time, I thought I must have an ulcer. The third time I realized it was my gallbladder. I went to an excellent specialist who confirmed to me what it was.<p>The internist tells me he&#x27;ll simply remove it.  &quot;You don&#x27;t need your gallbladder anyway.&quot;  I beg to differ.  He wants to provide a sure result, first time, every time.  I have a different goal: I want to do the least harm, least intrusion possible.  I was perfectly fine with suffering a bit longer to achieve my goal.  I postponed my appointment to proceed with the surgery and started by trying a &quot;gallbladder cleansing.&quot;  This is far from 100% reliable, but for me it worked.<p>If it hadn&#x27;t, I would have proceeded to the next mildest approach.  Surgery is my <i>last</i> resort.  For my doctor, it was his first.  I&#x27;m in this for the long haul; it&#x27;s my body and I have a responsibility to learn and understand it, to take proper care of it.",1413305941
8454378,comment,8453995,8454300,0,0,milen,,,"Thanks for your feedback.<p>1. I totally agree with you on this point - the MAS is a fine store for something that costs $1-10 and maybe took only a few months to develop, maybe a hobby project. But building a serious business for apps that cost $30-50+ is much harder - it&#x27;s possible but it won&#x27;t be ideal (talk to the developers behind the apps in those categories). The point behind the article is that it doesn&#x27;t have to be that way, the tools can be easily made available.<p>2. Only if you&#x27;re the selling directly to customers (and even then it&#x27;s not a massive deal as you can just signup for the VAT MOSS, which means you only deal with a single VAT entity, which you have to do if your sales exceed the VAT threshold). Furthermore, if you sell via a reseller, your sales lie outside the scope of VAT (as the sale is technically made by the reseller). For example, that&#x27;s the case with FastSpring, as they&#x27;re a US company and you will be receiving proceeds from them (assuming you&#x27;re in the EU). FastSpring themselves handle all VAT related issues (they comply with all EU laws and will pay it out) - you don&#x27;t have to lift a finger.",1413305935

8454369,comment,8453144,8453144,0,0,Morgawr,,,"When I was 17, 8 years ago, I was diagnosed with gall stones. Before that, I remember eating something before going to sleep, it was around 2AM (bad eating habits, I know) and as soon as I finished my sandwich an acute pain hit my chest. I was 100% sure I was having some kind of heart attack and I rushed into my parents&#x27; room asking for help. I had to lay down on my bed with my mom panicking while my father called an ambulance, by the time they arrived the pain had completely stopped. I was given a quick check but nothing serious so they just went away. Then the following night it happened again (curse you, bad eating habits) and I got rushed into ER. They found a lot of gall stones and one of them was blocking some ducts, I think with pancreas but I don&#x27;t remember. Due to an atrociously slow and bureaucratic process, I had to stay in the hospital for a whole month before surgery, because my delicate situation wouldn&#x27;t let me eat even the lightest of foods, not even soup.<p>Eventually I got surgery and said bye to my gall bladder. It&#x27;s certainly an experience I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone. It&#x27;s fairly low risk and very common, however the pain and feeling of something holding your chest was atrocious.",1413305887

This is an unsustainable proposition for most developers.<p>At a recent Seattle Xcoders meeting in Redmond, our speaker spoke about how he had given up his indie business and had now switched to contracting (disclosure: I run this meeting and had asked the speaker to speak).<p>At the meeting, I noted that Apple made its profits through hardware and they could therefore afford to make their software free. Similarly, Google is an ads company and so they don&#x27;t need to charge for their software. However, the dominance of these companies means that most users/consumers expect all their software to be free (and the small minority that downloads paid apps wants upgrades to be free).<p>It is going to be an uphill battle for any &quot;software&quot; company to survive in the future.

Prior to that, I had about 2 years of periodic extreme stomach pain, which felt kind of like the pain you would have after drinking too much strong whiskey.  The first time that it got really bad I went to an acute care center, they said it was either ulcer or gastritis.  Eventually, after about the 4th trip to the doctor I ended up on the ER due to the extreme pain.  They did an ultrasound test, and found gall stones logged in the duct leading to the stomach.  Meanwhile I was put on a zero fat diet until the surgery (since fat activates the gall bladder and pushes on the stones in the duct).<p>Now this is something that gets me upset.  Before the surgery, I had to go in for another test, where they observe the gall bladder by injecting iodine.  Then after 2 hours the radiologist said there is a second part of the test which activates the gall bladder, so they could observe that.  I then asked him what the effects of that would be, since the stones are logged in the duct, and I was on a no-fat diet due to it.  So he calls the surgeon, then comes back and says &quot;We are skipping that second test -- if we went through with it, you would have been in so much pain that we would have to hospitalize you&quot;.

If according to the sensors the breaks are not working, it doesn&#x27;t matter that they defacto work - the only logical conclusion that the computer can take at that point is assume it&#x27;s unable to apply breaks and relinquish command to the driver. And even multiple sensors can become broken - like here, the plane had 3 sensor pipes and they all became clogged with ice. The autopilot assumed that the values are invalid, therefore it couldn&#x27;t continue functioning - and gave control back to the pilots.<p>Also, don&#x27;t forget that you can&#x27;t have redundant systems for everything, unless you want to be driving a tank. Imagine driving an automatic car and then some bird poo falls on the laser-sensor and the car literally can&#x27;t see anymore(I am exaggerating, but the car can surely be blinded by something, the laser sensor on top can become dirty or damaged). The best it could do is apply full breaking force,but if you are on a motorway and there is an 18-wheeler behind you it could be a fatal idea.

It seems like cheating but assuming the opposite would be like claiming that you can affect breaking down of sucrose by taking it with healthy amount of laxative or dropping some from your mouth as you are munching it.<p>Besides you said yourself that sucrose, glucose and fructose are pretty much processed by all humans at about the same rate.<p>Considering all that, claiming that you can get significantly different amounts of energy from (table) sugar would be claiming that basic biochemistry is different for different people (and it&#x27;s not).<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure about what you said, that measuring calories spent is so hard. Energy is mostly turned to heat eventually, which is expelled with air you breathe out and the sweat.

Somehow I feel that only 30-50 years ago, there was not so much red tape in the way (nor was there the ability for a sophisticated/organized response - so it cuts both ways).<p>I vacillate between thinking that just giving money will not make a huge difference here, and thinking that it&#x27;s about all most of us can do that might help.  I also thought that in this day and age, maybe we could do something like, a Kickstarter to fund a response to Ebola (so that the &quot;people&quot; can make an immediate impact), possibly to get the money to the CDC or other government (or non-government) organizations, with the expressly stated restricted use being defined in advance by a non-profit or NGO as being for the Ebola response.  If money were truly the problem, it seems like we must be able to get money and fast.<p>It seems like money is definitely a part of the solution, but we also need those experts, heroes and volunteers who will put themselves in harm&#x27;s way, with the proper tools/training/safety precautions to help.

At the same time, if we can help those who are suffering by getting those &quot;fortunes&quot; in the hands of the people who have the drugs or can make the drugs that are needed, then while we may not like it, if it helps then it&#x27;s worth getting those funds in place.  I am aware of policies for compassionate use and pre-FDA approval, special relationships between government and private industry, where sometimes they can get the drugs needed without much trouble and they are often donated by the drug manufacturers (as I believe was the case with ZMapp).<p>In any case, it certainly is a complex challenge and I am glad to see people trying to make a difference.

8454220,comment,8449329,8450578,0,0,KMag,,,"> I wish for relational algebra programs that can have an optimizer run over it and determine the optimal join order etc.<p>Optimal join order usually is a function of both the query and the data, and a query optimizer inside your database doesn&#x27;t necessarily find the optimal join order.  It uses heuristics (which often include particulars about the data currently stored in the database) to find a join order that&#x27;s hopefully better than a naive query plan, in much the same way that optimization passes in a C compiler use heuristics to generate machine code that&#x27;s hopefully faster than a naive translation to machine code.<p>> The argument that SQL allows you to say what the result should be without any reference to the order in which the steps should be done is fine, except that it is hard to say some things in SQL.<p>The GP is talking about a surface syntax change, not a change in the underlying computation model.  Using a relational algebra notation, the query optimizer would have just as much freedom as an SQL query optimizer.  Relational algebra isn&#x27;t any more inherently imperative than SQL is.<p>> If C compilers can transform sequential, imperative code to an equivalent optimized form, I don&#x27;t see why relational algebra compilers / optimizers cannot.<p>It sounds like you want a semantic change that gives the query optimizer less freedom than an SQL query optimizer.  The GP is suggesting only a syntactic change.  The thing it sounds like you want does sort-of exist... many SQL databases will let you inspect the query plan that their optimizer has generated.<p>However, it sounds like you want some statically defined query plan.  The problem with this is that the optimal plan depends on the data that&#x27;s in the database at the time the query is run.  For instance, a query optimizer can look at a complex query with multiple constant WHERE clauses on indexed columns, and use the indexes to quickly determine the size of intermediate tables when deciding the order in which to perform joins.  A query language that statically defines a query plan cannot take advantage of this information, unless you want to &quot;re-compile&quot;/&quot;re-optimize&quot; once a day or something.  However, if you trust the database to automatically re-optimize on some schedule, then you&#x27;ve lost your static query plan and it seems you might as well let the query optimizer regenerate the plan based on heuristics created by the database developers rather than sticking to some static schedule of recompilation/reoptimization points.",1413304442

There&#x27;s no string type or integer type; both are just untagged streams of ones and zeroes. Basically, they&#x27;re what some languages call &quot;symbols&quot; or &quot;atoms&quot; or &quot;interned strings&quot;: where in, say, Erlang you&#x27;d have either the atom &#x27;hello&#x27; or the list-of-codepoints &quot;hello&quot; or the binary-string <<&quot;hello&quot;>>, in Nock the VM would only know that it&#x27;s holding onto the number 448378203247 (i.e. 0x68656c6c6f—the bitstring ASCII representation of the characters for &quot;hello&quot;.)<p>In Nock, instead of beta reduction privileging certain types (e.g. symbols, closures) as having special meanings at the head of a cons cell, Nock just defines a mapping between integers and functions. Effectively, Nock is a Lisp-2: the f in (f x) and the f in (g f) have different meanings.<p>In fact, in Nock, both the meaning of the f in (g f), and the meaning of the f in (g (f x)), are entirely determined by g—you could think of this as every Nock function being a hygenic macro, though it&#x27;s more than that. This seems dangerous, but Nock is supposed to be a &quot;VM target language&quot; only: the source languages that compile to it are left to define their own &quot;platform semantics&quot; by restricting and making guarantees on how arguments to functions in those languages will be evaluated (eagerly/lazily, early/late-bound, pre-beta-reduced like a function or post-beta-reduced like a macro, etc.) They&#x27;re also left to define dynamic/lexical scoping rules, by leaving the g the responsibility of resolving the f—and the x, if it wants—in (g (f x)).",1413303905

You don&#x27;t seem to have a good reason for creating a new framework, other than not knowing about the other tools or understanding the reasoning for the decisions they&#x27;ve made.<p>There are tons of absolutely excellent, battle-tested Node frameworks that do all the things you want coServ to do, and they&#x27;ve been around for a long time now. Express[1] is hugely popular, and it even forms the basis of other frameworks (like Sails[2]).<p>And, regarding your slide: Node doesn&#x27;t need its own Rails because it isn&#x27;t often used the same way Ruby is.<p>When you do want to create a Rails-like project, you can easily start out with Express, Tower[3], Geddy[4], or Sails. You just add components as you go using npm. Need ORM? Just plug it in.<p>With your own framework, you&#x27;re not going to have nearly as many users. That means it won&#x27;t be tested, hardened, and improved as much as the existing, popular frameworks. It also means that people who inherit your code will have to learn yet another framework to figure out how to maintain it.<p>Side note: creating dynamic HTML/CSS/JS with JavaScript isn&#x27;t a good idea because it isn&#x27;t portable and encourages mixing of intents.

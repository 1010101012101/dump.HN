(The next time you're using a newer generation copier, check whether there's some cat5/6 plugged into the back.)<p>So, if you copied something personal during your lunch break (considered a de facto perk, as long as exercised in restraint, e.g. that tax form before dropping same in the mail), would it remain on the copier hard drive?  Worse, would it be deliberately archived in a company datastore?<p>This place was big enough and sophisticated enough to have some technologists dedicated to managing the machines (in conjunction with a service contract).  Yet I ended up having to help them with some configuration difficulties.  Which led and leads me to consider the implications also raised by this story.  Any organization with a halfway decent security policy should understand and address these problems when first deciding the bring the machines in.  Yet they apparently don't.  And manufacturers should have addressed them up front in the feature set and use/management guidelines (e.g. a setting to wipe images on job completion, whether user controlled or in overall systems settings; a clear machine management feature to securely wipe (e.g. to a clearly defined and understood DoD standard) all drive data storage).  Yet they apparently haven't.  Or they don't clearly steer customers to knowledge and use of those features.<p>The reasons for the technological features are obvious.  Their mis-management, unfortunately, seems all too familiar.  I'm sure there were people arguing for better, but that would have been <i>hard</i>.",1271872374

You decide that you want to put an ad for your bar in the baseball stadium - it will drive business to your bar where you'll make money.  Let's say that it drives $1,000 worth of business to your bar every day.  That's hard to measure, but assume you can measure it.  Someone comes along and says that they'll pay you $10,000 per day to put an ad for their competing bar in that spot.  You calculate that that ad isn't worth $10,000/day to you - even taking into consideration natural business to your bar which might now be drawn to a competitor.  So, your bar loses the $1,000 per day that the ad drives there plus you determine that you'd lose another $5,000 per day from business that would naturally go to your bar, but is now driven to your competitor.  You'll sell them the ad.  Why would you sell them the ad?  Because you make money.<p>If you decide to keep your own ad, you have to justify $10,000/day in expense.  It drives $1,000 in business and a competitor's ad would lose you $5,000 in business for a total of $6,000.  It doesn't make business sense.<p>In order to want to keep your own ad in that space, you have to believe that you're gaining more than you would by accepting cash from your competitor.  In this scenario, you aren't - you'd be losing $4,000 per day. But if you determine that the ad drives $11,000 worth of business to your bar, then you'd be willing to ""pay"" that $10,000 for the ad.  So, your bar pays your baseball stadium $10,000 per day for the ad and the profits of the bar go up even with that expense.  However, if the bar becomes less profitable ""paying"" for that ad, it's better to sell it to the competitor.<p>When another department of the same logically-owned company does something for another department, it isn't free.  If Google's search gives Gmail a freebie ad, search is losing money.  So, the gain in money for Gmail must be greater than the amount that search is losing by not selling that ad to a competitor.  Therefore, from an internal accounting perspective, it makes sense for Gmail to bid on the ""email"" keyword just like everyone else as part of their marketing budget. If they're the top bidder, they get the spot.  If they aren't, they don't.",1271871711

1282745,comment,1282237,1282656,0,0,fnid2,,,"In large organizations, the decisions made by the employees are often not related to the bottom line.  They'd rather have more direct reports than increase profit margins.  Middle managers feel powerful because they tell many people what to do, not because they do more with fewer people.<p>Of course the investors want the company to be more efficient, but not always.  This is true in the retail industry where razor thin margins are the goal. Software is the opposite. Imagine if Walmart made 35% margins like many software vendors.  They'd be seen as gouging their customers and their prices would be too high. Target would create slimmer margins and take walmart's customers.<p>Also, employee salaries are tax deductible as expenses, so companies that are intent on employee satisfaction -- something seen as beneficial for successful organizations -- tend to pay out much, if not all profits as bonuses.  If a company is making lots of profits, they have to put that money somewhere, either investments in either infrastructure or labor and it's fairly easy to hire people. Otherwise, it goes to the government and no one likes that. Employees are expensive and hiring more is a quick way to legitimize a budget.  Really, investors care about revenue growth more than anything.  A company that is growing revenues and growing the share price is considered good. The profits could be paid out as dividends, but fewer companies are doing that and they are double taxed, so capital is more efficient if left in the organization.  Exceptions are very large, old and stable companies, but that's a different kind of investor. Those are income investors, not growth investors like I was.<p>It seems counter-intuitive because investors seldom have control over this kind of spending and revenue/employee isn't a popular metric for investing like PE, PEG, OM, or PM.  For example, look at the key statistics for MSFT at yahoo.  <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=MSFT+Key+Statistics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=MSFT+Key+Statistics</a> The number of employees appears nowhere and thus calculating revenue/employee is beyond the ability of most investors.

Would this also apply to the iPhone Dev kit and corresponding recent license changes? (iPhone developer program license section:3.3.1)<p>If you were a company in the UK who purchased developer kits for iPhone to build say a Unity game couldn't you legally demand a partial refund? Even if they are not going to enforce this requirement on you?",1271870323

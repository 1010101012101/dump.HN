The fact that you acknowledged my feedback with something more than an automated thank you email was what left a lasting impression.<p>The reddit alien was my first bumper sticker. At some point I thought about what made me put it on my car and I realized that the flattering human acknowledgment I received to the feedback made me feel like I was responsible for a tiny bit of all that was good with Reddit.<p>I have since used this approach (it's almost insulting to call it a tactic) to my own advantage with my startup. So thank you, for what the stickers taught me :)<p>If I had met you at a party and you had given me some free Reddit stickers it would not have meant as much.",1256799597

909613,comment,909449,909449,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I voted up the article because I think it'd be fun to discuss, but I think its premises and conclusions are off. Let's start with this one:<p>> Achievers score well on SATs and imbibe the poisonous assumption that success can be measured by the distance one travels from home.<p>People who've traveled far from where they originated have been highly respected through almost all of history. Even in extremely anti-immigration/xenophobic places like Tokugawa Japan 1600-1850, travelers were always highly respected and sought after.<p>There's a number of reasons for this. People who successfully migrate are looked upon as strong and healthy, because it's hard to move away from your support network. They have valuable different perspectives and understanding of culture, organizations, and technology. In sex and marriage, someone from further away reduces the chance of inbreeding and lets the dominant (usually more robust) characteristics from both parents take over, leading to more likely healthy and strong children.<p>People from New York are more respected in Los Angeles than in NYC. People from California are more respected in New York than in Los Angeles. Migrating does take guts and it is hard, but by living in different places you get multiple perspectives on how the world runs. And yes, quite literally the further you go, the more diverse, varied, and valuable your alternative perspectives are likely to be.<p>> Thus to achieve is to leaveâ€”shaking off the dust of a hick town and migrating to exotic locales with ""diverse cuisine and more varied shopping.""<p>He missed the biggest part of leaving to an urban place - a variety of ideas. Someone who is highly intelligent starts to question society - but if everyone, literally <i>everyone</i> in a town of 3,000 belongs to the First Baptist Congregation, and you're starting to have thoughts like - how come the Bible contradicts itself? How come it advocates enslaving your enemies? Genocide? Religious wars? Well, these are interesting conversations to have, even if you remain Christian. But you can't even have that conversation in many places where everyone is conformist. Sure, New York probably has a better mix of restaurants than Iowa, but that's not why smart people leave. It's because there's a better mix of ideas, simply by there being more ideas that you can find someone to talk about with. If you're intelligent, you begin to question things other people take for granted. If you live somewhere where people don't appreciate having their core values questioned, then you have to leave to keep growing intellectually. So the intelligent people leave. It's not some rabid consumerism.",1256799311

Everyone should just come to America. Yes, you Canadians playing peekaboo in the corner too.<p>D'oh, I upvoted your comment before I read the whole thing. After spending time in provincial China, yes, I agree that the people living with miserable quality of life on subsistence farming should move to Chengdu, Shanghai, Beijing, Taipei, Hong Kong, or one of the developed places in the rest of Asia or the West. Haven't been to Africa but I imagine it's similar.<p>Most of the valuable and useful things happening in the world right now depend more on working with other people than natural resources or lots of space. If you like it as a preference, go right ahead for it. But speaking in terms of individual success and progress, or as advancement as humanity/society-at-large, yes, generally speaking we ought to migrate to where there's other smart people we can work with.

The ribbon for all it's criticism seems to be highly functional, aesthetically pleasing and usable (using pictorial representations that aren't 16x16).
There's a ""Save as XPS/PDF"" plugin for Office as well, no one has mentioned which works fine.
I only use LaTeX for technical documents with a lot of math, but the Office equation editor does the job nicely with a few quirks here and there though.
My only qualm is the lack of ligatures and kerning in Office, which will hopefully be added in '10.",1256798375

909586,comment,890317,900768,0,0,foldr,,,">No, not really. Apples and oranges.<p>No, they come down to almost the same thing. If God is both good and omnipotent, it's obvious that evil should only exist if it is logically necessary for some amount of evil to exist in order for the maximum amount of good to exist. (God's omnipotence doesn't allow him to do things which are _logically_ impossible, such as creating a square circles, so if some degree of evil is a logically necessary corollary of maximal good, it follows that the best world that God can possibly make must still contain some evil.)<p>> You really can't imagine various gods for whom the question of evil arises in any interesting way?<p>It only arises in an interesting way for the kind of God I mentioned, so far as I can see. Can you suggest another kind of God for whom it arises? If  God is not 100% omnipotent, we can put down the existence of evil to his inability to fix it. If he's not 100% good, we don't expect the world to be 100% good in the first place. I suppose you could argue that the world is in some sense ""too evil"" to have been created by a God who is (say) only 99% good, and pose the problem of evil in that way for a non-maximally-good God (and similarly for a non-maximally-potent God); but that seems like a pretty uninteresting variant. I think it is a fairly accurate historical statement that the problem of evil is really one that only came to be posed with the advent of monotheistic religions, which all have a broadly similar conception of god.<p>In any case, what would it matter if the problem of evil arose for other kinds of god? It would not make the hypothetical questions any less interesting. At the very least, it's a cute way of framing questions about good, evil and various kinds of necessity.",1256796855

Worse, I don&#x27;t think that what is currently labeled as &#x27;patent trolls&#x27; is the worst aspect of software patents.<p>It&#x27;s the huge tech companies which have amassed and keeps on amassing broad software patents which is the real problem.<p>The only reason we are actually seeing some legal action being taken against &#x27;patent trolls&#x27; (i.e non-practicing entities) is because they are a nuisance to said huge tech companies.<p>Meanwhile these tech giants will use software patents to stifle / destroy competition instead of competing in the open market, you don&#x27;t need to look any further than Microsoft and Apple&#x27;s patent suit against Google which they are doing through third-party patents they bought specifically for that purpose, to stifle a competitor with which they can&#x27;t compete on the open market through the value of their products.<p>Now Google is a massive company themselves and has the funds to atleast mount a proper defence (not that it will matter in the first instance as Microsoft and Apple chose East Texas as it&#x27;s venue), but if you are a startup you have zero chance against these tech giants when they come knocking.<p>They can afford to drag this through court for ages, you most likely can&#x27;t, and even if you could and if you won, they could most likely simply choose another patent from their arsenal and go after you again.",1385607564

We already have something massively more cross platform and performance focused than JavaScript - C. The problem is that the standard library for C is utterly lacking, and there is a lack of focus on developing mechanisms to deploy native code /directly/ across the web.<p>Don&#x27;t kid yourself either - all the data being thrown around at the moment is always (always, always, always otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t even work!) translated into native code in some way - we are already throwing native code around the web, just in a horribly inefficient way. In todays world of sandboxing and virtualisation all of the security arguments that used to be completely reasonable are quite thoroughly invalidated.<p>I really do believe that fixing this from the technical perspective is not an impossible or even hard problem to solve - I can not stress this point enough. Game developers are constantly re-solving this problem in limited, optimisation focused ways. JavaScript implementations themselves are ultimately built on top of this technology or other technologies built on top of it. The standard libraries of modern scripting languages are possible to use from within the constraints of C. We have already solved all of these problems and there are myriad examples.<p>On the other hand, the political problem could be intractable... and thats sad.<p>Worst of all perhaps, C can be made better for performance without much thought or effort, and none of the new languages I see actually tackle this problem, which is quite real and measurable and impacts everything from productivity to the environment - they (quite rightly in many ways) focus utterly on ease of use and massive standard libraries. Why can&#x27;t we focus this effort on fixing C, or providing a better alternative?<p>Why are we trying to catchup with native code performance instead of using just native code? Why aren&#x27;t we improving native code performance in a serious way?",1385607446

This would be a warrenty/customer support nightmare for Verizon/ATT/Samsung/HTC/whoever.<p>Preface: I consider myself a fairly advanced power user on linux as a hobby, and I&#x27;m a computer technician/sysadmin [Windows] by day. I&#x27;ve had two Android phones over the past two years.<p>I have a Verizon Galaxy Nexus and was pissed that Verizon decided that phone was not to get 4.3 let alone Google decided no 4.4 for the Galaxy Nexus...(Each iteration of Android broke more things like speech to text.) Rather than wait for the never coming updates I started studying how to flash Cyanogenmod onto this. It looked a bit convoluted even compared to flashing firmware onto micro-contollers. Then the app hit the Play store and I figured I would give it a shot.<p>The app showed you what settings needed changed (like enable USB debugging) and how to do them, even to the point of opening the settings screens for you. A casual user would never even be able to find the settings again after that first opening. It would be akin to going straight to the Computer Management console in Windows or loading up fstab in Linux without telling a casual end user how to get there! My install process did not go smooth. The first thing it had wrong was the connection mode, said to use Camera Mode PTP instead of MTP. That is flat out wrong for this phone and it won&#x27;t connect. Then during the bootloader/rooting process, which the installer fully automatically does for you(!) a critical USB driver failed to install and it locked the phone up. The soft power button does not respond here and luckily I was able to pull the battery to reset. If this was a Nexus 4 or 5...I would have been praying that once the battery died I could still power it up for a recharge; a very good possibility it would have been bricked. Now that the software is installed I have no Photosphere in the camera and I can no longer connect to my work exchange calendar. I also managed to lose a few stored contacts somehow. I knew to backup my pictures/docs/data but a typical user would not.<p>Now imagine a typical consumer has just purchased a Galaxy S4 on contract for $199. They flash CM onto it and now best case they call Verizon/ATT/Samsung wanting to know why feature X isn&#x27;t working or why they lost the phone numbers of their friends/family – or worse their baby pictures/movies. Now that company either says &#x27;Go fly a kite&#x27; or reflashes and they still have data loss.

The GI is a very powerful interface for integrating with a SOA system like a BPM tool.<p>GI provides a builder that lets you build a full featured interface.

Submission of the forms will be with REST and the builder should let the json schema design and other aspects easier.<p>The interface should look really good and not like a 1988 solution as it looks today.

There are countless ways that Apple stifled competition when 3rd party applications compete directly with the applications Apple ships OOTB.<p>The unified in-app purchase has benefits, but it also comes with strings attached. The 30% rake means that either users pay for the markup or developers must eat that overhead. By locking application developers out of rolling their own in-house solutions, consumers suffer. That decision may benefit consumers by presenting a unified interface, but it has everything to do with making Apple more money. If Apple really had it&#x27;s users in mind, they could have simply created an API that provides the unified interface but allows developers to hook in their own back end processing. Better yet, allow in-app purchases that don&#x27;t have the 30% markup.

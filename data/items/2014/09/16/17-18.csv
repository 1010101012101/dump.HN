8325923,comment,8321054,8325283,1,0,taliesinb,,,"> As you can see from the doc, functional programming is completely underspecified in Mathematica.<p>That inference is not correct. That doc is one of many hundreds of &#x27;guide pages&#x27; that collect together various functions by domain/concern. It&#x27;s not meant to be the exhaustive proof of &quot;WL is a modern functional programming language with all the features you expect&quot;.<p>> I fear these are all dirty hacks and performing very poorly.<p>Why do you fear that? From my experience we&#x27;re about on a par with CPython.<p>> Why isn&#x27;t it better specified?<p>There is a gargantuan library of documentation, available both offline and online, that covers every area of the language, including core language areas like scoping.<p>> Why isn&#x27;t it better specified? Because Wolfram wants to prevent competition?<p>We don&#x27;t need to obscure how the language works to prevent competition, we can rely on the fact that it would take hundreds of engineers (with a full spectrum of domain knowledge) a decade to replicate the kind of functionality we have.<p>The exact thing you seem to want, which is &quot;what does a LISP programmer need to know about WL?&quot; doesn&#x27;t exist, but perhaps it should! It might make sense to add Block, Module, and With to the functional programming page, though the Scoping Constructs guide [1] is the place to start understanding our scoping.<p>> > Compiled code does not handle numerical precision and local variables in the same way as ordinary Wolfram Language code. \n> This is a huge warning sign.<p>Again, you seem to have little patience for documentation. The notes in the function page are a summary of salient points, rather than an essay about every detail. The tutorial goes into more depth [2].<p>And specifically: precision tracking is something almost no-one else does. BLAS can&#x27;t do it -- so yes, the semantics have to change if you want speed. Lisp and the FP community would have the same problem if they represented quantities with the generality we do.<p>[1] <a href=""http://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/ScopingConstructs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/ScopingConstruct...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/CompilingWolframLanguageExpressions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/CompilingWolf...</a>",1410890378

8325893,comment,8309490,8313616,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> And that is a patent-eligible application* of the abstract equation<p>I think we&#x27;ve come to the heart of it here. The heat output of a particular reaction is a law of nature. Its calculation is a mathematical operation. The discovery of that mathematical formula <i>E=mc^2</i> is <i>non-obvious</i>. It took centuries of scientific minds before Einstein. But given that law of nature and its mathematical description, the decision of how many steam turbines to build for a given energy output is preposterously obvious.<p>So the problem is they&#x27;re granting patents on obvious applications of computations just because the computation itself is non-obvious.<p>Which makes it a simple rule to clarify things: a) Computations are not patentable and b) obvious applications of unpatentable computations are not patentable.<p>> And similarly there are potentially infinite applications of a mathematical operation. Patenting one application does not provide a monopoly over the mathematical operation itself.<p>The problem is they aren&#x27;t issuing patents on applications, they&#x27;re issuing patents on algorithms. It doesn&#x27;t matter what application you use the software for because the software itself infringes the patent. The so-called application devolves to &quot;run this algorithm on a computer.&quot;<p>> But even algorithms are too specific a word for most software patents. Consider a patent on a mobile app (valued at, say, $10 billion) that claims sending photos over a network that are auto-erased at the receiver after a time period expires. What is the algorithmic complexity of that?<p>Let&#x27;s see.<p><pre><code>  recv_file(image_url, filename);\n  set_timer(time_period, bind(&delete, filename));\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s about it. Obviously each function has its own rabbit hole to go down, but so do <i>all</i> mathematical operations, even the seemingly fundamental ones that programmers treat as intrinsic. You can make any mathematical operation arbitrarily complex; it&#x27;s turtles all the way down. And each of the individual functions above exists in the prior art.",1410890148

8325787,comment,8324578,8324667,17,0,john_other_john,,,"I was one of those who bought books, took weekly reverent hauls at the bookstore, from Prentice Hall, until about twenty plus years ago.<p>I could not bring myself to appreciate Linux as it was, as it could be, back then. But I realized the trend, because I could understand the economics, both financial and cultural.<p>What I think happened to me, was a kind of disillusionment. I saw the progression as a long reimplementation of then already ageing concepts, because there was a genuine need to prevent too much being stalled by myopic business and pseudo or real monopoly. Once Microsoft had their hands on the VMS code, or at least David Cutler (it&#x27;s a strange story and a car crash that ended his counteract architect, and look where senior DEC management got their sinecures)i felt that all Microsoft had to do for twenty years, was expose functions form the NT kernel, to stay ahead in terms of features. With the only viable chase being a reconstruction of what was by definition much earlier thinking, that had to become the spirited, almost religious, movement behind Linux, or fail. I think that era is over.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone won. Not exactly, but I am biased because I will happily consider windows a development platform, with exceptions, and vice versa. I hope that era of chasing against a monopoly is closed, but the massive expansion of installed systems has not helped anyone. Minis or Plan 9 are far better ways to explore computing in a fundamental way, and remain in some ways, more advanced, and if there&#x27;s a toss up, that can be argued by accessibility. You can&#x27;t play with the Linux kernel, or with NT, without enormous system knowledge, compared with even ten or fifteen years ago. As a result, we have stagnated the progress of the art.<p>Sometimes I am even more hopeful, for the windows platform, since the win32 system has survived so much, and lived in emulation on its primary system now fifteen years at least. The compartmentalized driver model for NT offers a certain hope, e.g. for storage driver development, because it was well separated by design. POSIX holds everything closer to the system descriptions that were drawn thirty and more years ago. Obviously that is powerful, but it reduces potentially useful abstraction.<p>What hope now, is the research in distributed systems, that first interested me, thirty years ago, and I was not reading up to date papers, then, finds a home, in the mix of virtual machines, virtual datacenter even, we can put into a box. Things like on the fly code recompilation and all that&#x27;s been done to accommodate usually legacy systems and VMs, did progress a lot of art, and instruction sets developed to accommodate that. Yet, with some instructions that matter to me, they are norm and likely will not be virtualized.<p>Forgive me my hand waving approach, please, but what interests me is when user applications are so many layers away from the kernel, especially in windows systems, I think there is room for approaching again what underlies everything. When ZFS was announced, I immediately craved for a PCI card subsystem for every windows workstation we had. This is now more of a economic quandary, nothing serious stops you building the card and exposing higher level APIs that way. We&#x27;ve performance we can deliberately waste. So much so in consumer space, enthusiast home users, there needs to be a application that takes advantage.<p>My thoughts are that we need better content addressing, than the web has an ability to offer. Content addressing is what the web has enabled, on a massive scale. The network design behind it has caused all manner of diversions for design, just take a look at how a CDN is built, or buffer bloat, or the economic constraints of &quot;real&quot; internet access, which is available in the UK through only maybe two consumer DSL ISPs...<p>To change from the &quot;white coat&quot;, &quot;glass room&quot; datacenter model, which has prevailed so well that the company who so accurately proclaimed &quot;The Network Is The Computer&quot; (to mem memorably, in a billboard right outside my office, no place anyone save me and colleagues would ever see much) is part of a classical &quot;mainframe&quot; model company.<p>The next applications that matter, will challenge the infrastructure of computing we use. This is why things like Minis and Plan 9 still matter. Both are great educational tools, but in my shop, I try to get everyone who joins us, to spend some time with Plan 9, to rethink how we appreciate data and content at a low level, and I believe that is really important to my company, the way we think, and will become important much more widely.",1410889239

It’s great at detecting and transcribing words, listening for specific commands, and making matches against expected inputs.<p>Current state of the art is not actually great at transcription or detection, in fact only Google and Apple&#x27;s algos are any good and they both involve sending all your voice recordings to their servers where huge models are used to transcribe, meaning lag times and it&#x27;s not efficient to always be sending every minute of audio to them. If you want to do continuous listening or use local voice transcription it&#x27;s possible but you are limited by your hardware.<p>Listening for activation words is also a hard problem. In fact, Moto X has a chip designed just to listen for &quot;Ok Google&quot; so clearly you see some of the problems: 1. it uses lots of power, 2. it has no flexibility.<p>Other examples he gives assumes the phone won&#x27;t intercept outside noise or will differentiate between voices. This is unfortunately not the case -- you could maybe apply a training and have a custom voice model but it&#x27;s still just an unrealistic idea at this point.<p>>  The reason current voice interfaces suck is because they force the speaker to consciously enter a “voice” mode and then create context around the action they want the computer to perform. This makes no sense; the computer should just always be listening for potential commands within the context of whatever the user is doing.<p>Yes, this is true. But it&#x27;s all side-effect because of power, bandwidth, and processing-power constraints given today&#x27;s algos / models. Today&#x27;s voice processing algos rely on lots of data.

Likewise, if c1 is similarly programmed, it might make a more cautious tentative to shift lanes, but give itself time and space to maneuver back in case c2 doesn&#x27;t slow down. And again, the same kind of logic can happen between c2 and c3, or c3 could have the same prediction as c2 against c1 or even against both c1 and c2 in the case where none of them can talk to eachother.<p>So not all is lost, and in cases where reliable communication and acknowledgements cannot be obtained, AI cars would (if they&#x27;re well programmed) adjust their current logic/driving so that they have the mechanical leeway to adjust to various scenarios.<p>For a very well programmed AI present in all cars (but without common knowledge of this), each car would consider the physics and pick the optimal way to drive while keeping enough margin of error to react and avoid collisions (or being the cause of collisions! avoiding two cars only to make one of them bump into a third one is no good!). In the vast majority of actually-existing situations, I suspect this would still be faster and much safer than human drivers (given the above assumption of good AI).",1410888550

Reading statutes is a lot like reading code. Reading cases is like ... not running the code, because we can&#x27;t do that, but more like having it explained by a particularly skillful coder with decades of experience. It&#x27;s fascinating if you&#x27;re into that stuff.<p>So to start with, we have this statute in Massachusetts that says it is unlawful for a car manufacturer &quot;to own or operate, either directly or indirectly through any subsidiary, parent company or firm, a motor vehicle dealership located in the commonwealth of the same line make as any of the vehicles manufactured ... by the manufacturer[.]&quot;<p>Sounds pretty clear cut, right? Tesla can&#x27;t run a dealership in Massachusetts that sells Teslas -- there&#x27;s no helpful exception left out of that quote. But the Court didn&#x27;t come out that way.<p>If you really want the reading-unfamiliar-code experience, go read the surrounding parts of the statute[1] and see how you think the Court understood that section. It&#x27;s under subsection (10).<p>...<p>So, it turns out the Court looked to the legislative history, which is the closest we have to comments -- statements of legislators and the Governor explaining why they were voting for (or not vetoing) the statute. (As a side note, Massachusetts has terrible legislative history, because not much was recorded of the debates, many decisions are made behind closed doors by the Democratic super-majority, and unlike Congress, we rarely explain why a statute is being passed in the text itself -- but there seems to be some history in this case.) The Court concluded that the statute is intended to protect dealers from their <i>own</i> manufacturers. The Court finds: &quot;the purpose of c.93B historically was to protect motor vehicle dealers from a host of unfair acts and practices historically directed at them by their own brand manufacturers and distributors.&quot; Or, quoting an earlier case, it&#x27;s about &quot;preserving a sound competitive market free of the domination of oligopolists[.]&quot;<p>That matters because intent matters -- the Court isn&#x27;t a computer, and if at all possible it tries to do what the Legislature actually wanted.<p>So then the Court looks back at the statute, and lo and behold, subsection 10 is only one of 12 subsections! (We knew there had to be at least 10.) And every single one of them (besides #10) is obviously designed to regulate relationships between dealers and their own manufacturers. So the Court says, &quot;It would be anomalous to find, within this detailed list of rights and protections that are conferred on dealers vis-à-vis their manufacturers and distributors, a lone provision giving dealers protection against competition from an unaffiliated manufacturer.&quot; Instead, they conclude that the Legislature -- which was trying to promote competition -- must have intended subsection 10, like the others, to be a right of dealers against their own manufacturers.<p>And that&#x27;s why this is ultimately dismissed on the basis of &quot;standing.&quot; Cases (almost always) have to be filed by someone with a legally protected interest at stake. If the statute is designed to protect Tesla dealers (if any), then only Tesla dealers can file a case. That means, for now, no one can.<p>(It&#x27;s an interesting side effect that this essentially means there can be no third-party Tesla dealers in Massachusetts as long as Tesla is selling directly. It&#x27;s an open question whether that&#x27;s a good thing.)<p>[1] <a href=""https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXV/Chapter93B/Section4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXV/Cha...</a>",1410887982

Not with the candidate. Not even with people inside your company but outside of that candidate&#x27;s hiring process.

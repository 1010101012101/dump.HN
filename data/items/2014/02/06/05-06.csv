A Circle inherits from an Ellipse, of course, because a Circle is-a Ellipse. By specializing as a Circle, we get extra reader methods such as getRadius(). Great.<p>But what about mutators? For an Ellipse, it may have a mutator called squash() that holds the major axis constant and halves the minor axis. But that leaves us with a problem, because circles can&#x27;t be squashed while remaining circles.<p>Let&#x27;s say we have a program like:<p><pre><code>    void f1() {\n      Circle myCircle(10.0);\n      f2(myCircle);\n      cout << myCircle.getRadius() << &quot;\\n&quot;;\n    }\n    void f2(Ellipse &e) {\n      if (...)\n        e.squash();\n    }\n</code></pre>\nInheritance says that f2 must also accept a Circle. But what happens when we try to squash it? We can either throw a runtime error there, or we could let the squash succeed and the getRadius() in f1() will fail.<p>Although a Circle <i>value</i> is an Ellipse <i>value</i>, a Circle <i>variable</i> is not an Ellipse <i>variable</i>. In fact, inheritance for variables should go in the opposite direction as inheritance for values, because an Ellipse variable can certainly hold a Circle value.",1391665677

7188924,comment,7186686,7186686,1,0,Aqueous,,,"I think the reason visual programming hasn&#x27;t taken off is there is a very real difference between what you can express with language and what you can express visually. Images don&#x27;t really contain determinate, precise statements or propositions the same way that written or spoken word does.  In contrast language can express any thought, no matter how  recursive or abstract, effortlessly. For the narrow domain of programming - not typesetting, not rendering and manipulating images - the text editor happens to be an extremely very powerful tool that allows us to tell the computer exactly what we want it to do. It hasn&#x27;t been replaced because it hasn&#x27;t needed to be - it is simply the most powerful tool in which to write language.<p>The other reason visual programming hasn&#x27;t taken off is because programmers aren&#x27;t visually oriented, right-brained, intuitive people. Exceptions to this rule abound, but I am certainly not one of them, and neither are many programmers I&#x27;ve known. They&#x27;ve tended to be left brained, linear, linguistic, rational-over-intuitive sort of people - which is why we pick up computer languages so quickly, and it&#x27;s also why we like typing code into a text editor instead of drawing our program on screen. I know that functionality isn&#x27;t lateralized to easily and this is an oversimplification - but there does seem to be a dispositional difference between those who are attracted to programming and those who aren&#x27;t.<p>But this&#x27;ll probably change, as everything does. As the author notes FP and lambda calculus have been around since the beginning of computer science as a field and they are just now starting to get mainstream traction. So, maybe, in about 20 years visual programming tools will start to be mature enough to applied to any arbitrary problem., and a powerful visual language will develop that attracts enough visually-oriented people to change or revolutionize the field. But we can&#x27;t put the chicken before the egg - the tooling needs to mature enough to cause this network effect to occur.",1391665581

That&#x27;s what their manager is there to discuss with them.  They hopefully have a good rapport and this can be brought up in their next discussion.<p>If you have a good relationship with your manager, talk to them - but realise that they&#x27;re obligated to inform the HR department about it.<p>If your company has an &quot;Employee Resource Group&quot; for LGBT employees, speak to someone in it (if you&#x27;re in a sufficiently &quot;large tech company in the bay area&quot;, it will probably have one).<p>(If you&#x27;re at Facebook, firstly, I think you should feel comfortable doing all the above without fear of any downside, but I&#x27;d be happy to talk to you about it in person or online and connect you with the right people.)",1391663274

And endless string of projects with clearly defined specifications.<p>With your years of bugfixing experience, you intuitively know what makes working code, but probably feel lost when it comes to architecting a side project from scratch.<p>So, take what you know (your employer&#x27;s product domain and engineering projects) and rewrite them on your own time. Of course, you probably can&#x27;t release it due to your employment contract (if it&#x27;s anything like the usual contract), but that&#x27;s beside the point.<p>With architecture out of the way, and your super ability to write bug-free tested code, you&#x27;re forced to focus on your weak area: architecture. It&#x27;ll be fun. And stress free, since no one will ever see it.",1391663197

If all this is not being expressed to anyone, it&#x27;s easy to keep you where you are, especially when you appear to lack the confidence to move on. Express it in terms that you want to grow as a programmer.<p>Though you are fixing bugs, are you playing an essential role? If you quit, would they hire someone else to fix these bugs? Have you made yourself indispensable? If not, maybe you&#x27;re not taking on enough responsibilities or taking the lead when you could. Maybe you require too much handling, or maybe you don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s possible you&#x27;re undervalued.<p>Are you skills at fixing bugs any good? You might as well make the best of the situation and improve your skills at testing and code analysis. You will always be fixing bugs in any programming job.<p>It sounds like it could be bad company culture, unaware personal laziness, or a negative problem, or a little bit of everything. But now that you&#x27;re thinking about your situation and what you want your future to look like, you&#x27;re in a better position to overcome these obstacles.<p>You asked, &quot;Am I done?&quot;  Not even close. Even if you&#x27;re 10 or more years older than it sounds like you are, you can accomplish a lot over the long haul, even when you&#x27;re stuck in one spot for the short term.",1391663127

More mistakes are made in other areas, though.  Usually amusingly more basic areas.<p>The question seems to be whether encoding at the type level will help with these areas.  It seems the conflict is the idea that fully proving a solution is superior to partially proving it.<p>Laudable, to be sure, but anyone that has attempted to prove that quick sort works knows, it isn&#x27;t easy.  Just understanding the shorter versions of some programs takes a fair bit of brain power as it is.  Understanding the fully specified version can be orders of magnitude more complicated.<p>So, I am left wondering if it isn&#x27;t enough to stop at &quot;passes all the tests.&quot;  Especially if you have the correct tests.<p>And eventually one wonders whether the &quot;correct tests&quot; includes more stringent types.  Maybe it does.  Maybe it doesn&#x27;t.  Likely depends on the situation, is my bet.",1391663009

This is true for both developers, and the people deploying these apps. I can&#x27;t count how many times I&#x27;ve had a python app fail to build on a new box because of some C extension and forgetting to install a package on (centOS, ubuntu, debian, ect).<p>Docker lets me do all of this once for my app, with a Docker image, and now when I want to deploy it, all the system needs is Docker installed. This means on my laptop, on our staging server, on our production server, all they need is Docker, and I will have the exact same environment in each place, and to deploy the app, its exactly the same.<p>There&#x27;s a ton of other bonuses like each container&#x27;s dependencies and processes are isolated from each other. I also get a ton of the Docker features that allow containers to communicate with each other and setup service discovery between them (ex: your database container can now expose information to the app container using environmental variables).<p>Tons of other good reasons too though, you should check it out.",1391662870

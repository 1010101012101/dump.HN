Under this model there is no such thing as a &quot;DevOps engineer&quot; as &quot;DevOps&quot; is a team structure not a job title.<p>Now days &quot;DevOps&quot; often just means &quot;cloud deployment engineer&quot; or &quot;we can get a developer to look after the servers&quot;.<p>What you seem interested in is the ops side of things. Usually this will be under a title like sysadmin, deployment engineer, &quot;DevOps&quot;.",1423475952

Someone once reported a vaccine turned them into the Incredible Hulk, and they <i>cannot, by law</i> remove it.<p>Vaccination rates are <i>not</i> pretty high when you&#x27;re talking about highly contagious diseases. Measles has an R0 of roughly 16-18, which translates to a critical threshold of ~94% needing to be vaccinated in order to have herd immunity, assuming 100% efficacy. There are <i>many</i> communities below that threshold.<p>Wakefield isn&#x27;t one of our own. We kicked him out for being a fraud.<p>Ebola is subject to a major public health response. I have friends in Sierra Leone. The 101st Airborne, the CDC, Doctors without Borders and many other groups are all in West Africa. Access to intensive care is driving down the mortality for Ebola. Believe me, there are still a huge amount of resources being spent on Ebola containment. We&#x27;re capable of being worried about more than one disease at the same time.<p>Of course, we wouldn&#x27;t have to be if people were vaccinated against measles.",1423475931

9020419,comment,9018319,9019028,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I used to have serious problems with working on free and open source projects due to my contract at work.  Even though my employers said that they  would evaluate things on a &quot;case by case&quot; basis, it was often &quot;Write it first and we&#x27;ll tell you if you can distribute it&quot;.  Then if I wrote it they would always say &quot;no&quot;.  Eventually I learned that working in an environment I like is more important to me than the size of my paycheck.  Every job I&#x27;ve worked at has always given me more than enough to live comfortably, even if it wasn&#x27;t always at market rate.  Like other people on this thread, I give steep discounts for compatibility with free and open source development.  I am much happier as a result.<p>But to answer your question, just request time with your manager and explain the situation pretty much exactly as you have done here.  If they say that you can&#x27;t distribute the code, I would abide by the decision.  Make sure to explain how important it is to you, but be civil and don&#x27;t make any ultimatums.  This is much better than having them take legal action on you after the fact (which has happened to many unsuspecting developers).<p>If they can&#x27;t accommodate you, consider what I said at the beginning.  It took me years to transition to a type of work that made me happy, but it was worth it.  You don&#x27;t have to do anything drastic, but it never hurts to think about your options and work towards your dreams.",1423475890

I&#x27;m not trying to be condescending -- I&#x27;ve learned a lot about this recently due to the outbreak, and I encourage you to do some reading as well.<p>Some vaccines are very effective at the individual level. Others are not, and so the safety of any individual is <i>reliant</i> on herd immunity. So when you say &quot;they should be effective&quot;, I don&#x27;t know if you mean to prevent an individual&#x27;s illness or to prevent an outbreak. Either way, vaccines are not just intended to be effective for the individual -- they&#x27;re intended to protect an entire society.<p>As far as Ebola: the medical community is certainly up in arms over that, as well. It&#x27;s a huge crisis, and millions are being poured into its treatment and prevention.<p>The problem with Ebola is that there&#x27;s a massive cultural barrier. Many of the most at-risk people are afraid of vaccines, and some of them totally misunderstand how Ebola is spread. Those two situations are getting better, but it&#x27;s much harder of a situation to solve.<p>The reason you&#x27;re reading so much about measles is that it&#x27;s affecting a wealthy, educated country, and it&#x27;s directly caused by misinformation from the &quot;anti-vaxxer&quot; movement. It&#x27;s alarming because it&#x27;s a backslide, and we know it&#x27;s preventable because we did such a good job preventing it for so long.",1423475682

No offence to the effort outside of APPL, but it is not enough to support a full-fledged eco-system with all 3rd-party F/OSS written in Objective-C that is compatible with what Apple currently uses in order to build reusable components. GNUStep has existed for so many years, and Étoilé for years as well, but I did not see emergence of adoption in community comparable to that of other popular F/OSS frameworks, e.g. Mono and Qt. And I do not see how this issue could be circumvented, unless some big player shows up and adopt any of these projects, like what Google did to Android.",1423475674

Any recommendations for a platform to send 500,000 e-mails? MailChimp credits would run $0.005 per e-mail, or $2,500. I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s too expensive, but I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has used other services with potentially cheaper prices, and the same results.<p>2. Secondly, has anyone on HN done something similar before (mass e-mailing users that have stopped using a service), and if so, did you see positive results? What percentage of users returned to the site through the e-mail? 1/10, 1/100, 1/1000? I have no idea what to expect, so I&#x27;m curious to hear some stories. Either way, I&#x27;ll start small with 1,000 or 10,000 e-mails, and monitor the results.

  collaboration of news outlets, including the Guardian, Le Monde, BBC Panorama 
  and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists

   1 In late 2007, Hervé Falciani, an IT expert at HSBC&#x27;s Swiss bank, hacked into 
     its customer files. He fled to France with police on his trail for breaching 
     Switzerland&#x27;s rigid bank secrecy laws.
   2 The French authorities detained him, but refused to extradite him when they 
     realised the data could identify thousands of French tax evaders. Falciani now 
     lives in France under protection.
   3 In early 2010, under finance minister Christine Lagarde, France prepared 
     confidential lists of the leaked names for other countries. The so-called 
     &quot;Lagarde list&quot; led to scandal and arrests in Greece, Spain, the US, Belgium and 
     Argentina.
   4 Britain&#x27;s tax authority, HMRC, received a list in 2010 from which it identified 
     more than 1,000 tax evaders. More than £135m ($206m) was quietly recovered in 
     repayments, but only one person was prosecuted. There has been no UK legal action 
     against HSBC. Names were never revealed.</code></pre>",1423473505

It is not true that this is sufficient to explain why the water goes up.<p>In particular, the statement &quot;because of inertia and the fact that water is not compresible, it has to keep moving&quot; is false.<p>The fact that water is not compressible means that the water moving in one direction is capable of exerting an extremely large force on the water moving in the other direction when they run into each other, which would bring the water to a halt as the hole closes. The interesting question is: why doesn&#x27;t this happen?<p>One possibility is that the free surface at the bottom of the hole travels upward due to what amounts to a buoyancy force (think of the hole as a bubble with no top). The water pressure at the bottom of the hole is the same as it is everywhere at that depth, and so the bottom move upwards, and this pressure force creates upward momentum that is not met by any opposing force when the bottom of the hole reaches the water&#x27;s surface, and therefore creates an upward-moving column of water.<p>One way of testing this would be by inserting an empty pipe into the water against a flat disk of the same diameter, and then rapidly pulling the pipe out. The flat disk would impede water from moving upward into the hole, which would--on my account--dramatically reduce the size of the spike.<p>As to the &quot;unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics&quot;, the argument is bogus: <a href=""http://www.tjradcliffe.com/?p=381"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tjradcliffe.com/?p=381</a> Our mathematical descriptions of reality almost all admit of extraneous solutions that have to be discarded based on physical--not mathematical--considerations.

People in many countries avoid taxes and in India this is especially egregious since close to 97% of the population does not pay any income taxes[1]. For a population of 1.25 billion with 400m below the poverty line, this is not good.

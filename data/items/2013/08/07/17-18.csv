Well, maybe you&#x27;ll get hired, maybe you won&#x27;t, you have to hope that you picked an area that was hot 4 years ahead of time and that the people managing recruitment don&#x27;t have their heads up their asses. Also you need to hope that any company isn&#x27;t already in the process of globalizing or outsourcing said STEM jobs because they can do <i>those</i> cheaper elsewhere (see IBM story yesterday).<p>And if you didn&#x27;t go into STEM, well, fuck you because STEM is the only college that&#x27;s any good by 95% of all accounts.<p>And if you didn&#x27;t go into college, then fuck you because you&#x27;re going to do back-breaking labor with no guarantee of financial security.<p>Something&#x27;s gotta change or things are going to be grim.

It&#x27;s a bit of a mixed blessing, to be honest; while it&#x27;s great that you don&#x27;t have to remember to close files when you&#x27;re done with them, the asymmetry of the feature (files don&#x27;t magically open when you want to go back to them after they&#x27;ve been reaped) tends to make it a bit more frustrating than useful to me.  It&#x27;d be interesting to see a more user-friendly implementation.",1375898396

6174427,comment,6172152,6173077,1,0,mpyne,,,"The same adversarial system that would be used for Snowden, and was used for Swartz, Ellsberg, Drake, and even DJB?<p>Admittedly that&#x27;s kind of a strawman as you&#x27;re not claiming here anything to do with those one way or another. But many who don&#x27;t trust the government to put people on trial do point to cases exactly like those.<p>On the other hand if you&#x27;re simply saying that we shouldn&#x27;t trust government to prosecute cases, operate surveillance without oversight, etc. <i>just because</i> they&#x27;re the government I would agree with you 100%.<p>But on the other hand by the definition I wouldn&#x27;t even trust the government to deliver clean water or build roads without oversight. As an example of where even the latter could go wrong I&#x27;ll point to a book that HN pointed out to me, &quot;Fatal Purity&quot; about the French Revolution... one of the many examples of then-current corruption by the nobles was of road-building. The specific example was of a new provincial road that was argued necessary for the people to build despite there being an existing road... it was built right up to a nobleman&#x27;s estate and then the rest was canceled, leaving the lord with a gratis road built straight to his property.<p>Or for a modern example, the famed &quot;Bridge to Nowhere&quot;.<p>So there is no part of government which is inherently trustworthy and worthy of operating without oversight. But once you&#x27;ve established good oversight (such as you&#x27;d definitely want over criminal prosecutors!), that leaves the possibility of other government-provided functions open again.<p>There may certainly still be reasons that government should <i>not</i> perform those functions, but it wouldn&#x27;t be about the impossibility of providing oversight.",1375898371

Other than automation, how else does Vagrant help a developer, and how does it tie into the various VPS services (such as AWS, DO, etc...)?<p>Vagrant lets you define a server environment that you can turn on with just a simple &quot;vagrant up&quot;. For apps that have server dependencies (who doesn&#x27;t?) like databases or MQ servers, you can isolate them into a standard VM. If someone else is going to work on your app then they can get started immeidately via &quot;vagrant up&quot;. No need to manually setup the server dependencies, it&#x27;ll all automagically build itself.<p>Once you start using it you&#x27;ll never go back to manually setting up server dependencies for dev. It pays for itself in time savings the <i>first time</i> you use it.<p>Vagrant integration with AWS or DO is simply to have the server spin up there rather than locally. Even cooler is the expermental Docker integration (as a provider) as it lets you run many Vagrant VMs with minimal overhead.",1375897700

But they make virtually no meaningful demand for that privacy. Thwarting terror attacks are a much higher priority to them. Want evidence of that? Well, the body-conscious, vain, generally out-of-shape American public routinely submits to electronic strip searches to get onto airplanes. You think they care if someone&#x27;s screening their calls to catch Abu Shahid?<p>They would accept that argument. And with that acceptance, the expectations of privacy and the notion of what &quot;reasonable&quot; searches are would be, in short order, redefined --- those rights being explicitly predicated on contemporary mores by the Constitution.<p>When I look at it from this angle, it becomes apparent that while privacy is inconvenient to the USG, and something they feel they have to work around, it&#x27;s not something they&#x27;re intent on eliminating. Despite the rhetoric from the tech punditry, the USG <i>has not</i> stated that it&#x27;s reasonable for them to surveil US citizens; their defense has instead been that they <i>are not</i> surveilling them.

I remember what the place was like on 9/11: when CNN&#x27;s servers couldn&#x27;t keep up, I kept going to Slashdot (and then IRC, something I didn&#x27;t know much about). Slashdot was a great source of news about geek culture. I liked that it was that it was curated by editors, because as a teenager I had no idea where to find out about the sorts of things they talked about.<p>However, what led me to leave Slashdot wasn&#x27;t any sort of Eternal September like effect. Yes, there were many troll comments there, but there&#x27;s also lots of options to adjust moderation types to suit one&#x27;s particular interests. Rather, what I found was that the editors themselves seemed to stop caring. Article summaries would be blatantly incorrect or have distorting editorializing in them. If the whole point of the Slashdot style of reporting was to present a small number of quality stories each day, how could I trust the site when what the editors presented was inaccurate?<p>When I came to HN I was surprised to discover that articles simply have a title and URL. Sometimes there&#x27;s editorializing in the titles, but in general its pretty good. But I can understand what Malda is saying when he expresses his frustration in wading through the front pages of HN. I don&#x27;t know if the solution is to implement topics of some sort or not, but the user volume on this site is picking up enough that I think some sort of organization beyond a single ranking algorithm is required. It might also lead some interesting stories that never make it onto the front page to reach an audience. This problem of course isn&#x27;t unique to HN... whether its Slashdot or Twitter or Facebook, getting the signal to noise ratio to an appropriate level is a really hard problem.<p>That being said, in my short time here I have learned a tremendous amount -- albeit much of which lies in my bookmarks!",1375896735

Then look at integrating TOR functionality into these servers and clients as transparently as possible such that they will relay internal traffic by default and prefer hidden service connections to servers that are both public and private to reduce the need for exit nodes.<p>At the end of the day strong encryption can simply be made illegal, so it&#x27;s more important to try to get society back to a &quot;mind your own business&quot; outlook.

Then set up your site so that your frontpage is a doppelganger of HN&#x27;s frontpage circa 2007.  I.e. today your frontpage should look how the HN frontpage looked on August 7th, 2007.<p>That way there&#x27;s (a) the appearance of activity, (b) a constant stream of interesting content on the frontpage, and (c) interesting discussion in the comments.  Before long, new real users would start to participate, e.g. by replying to doppleganger comments.  At that point, it&#x27;s inevitable that the new site would start to get traction as long as those new users keep coming back, which they should because the frontpage is interesting.<p>This could only work if someone had the balls to actually deploy the currently-released Arc 3.1 version of Hacker News, though, rather than rolling their own version in Rails.  There&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with trying to clone HN&#x27;s featureset, but it&#x27;s interesting to note that not a single one of the HN knockoffs successfully cloned HN&#x27;s entire featureset.

According to that snapshot, when HN was 558 days old there were 38,693 submissions and 133,882 comments.  The snapshot claims there were only 6,519 users.

I upped it to 10000 iterations: (OpenJDK) Java took 3.3s, JS (with node) took 7.8s, C++ took 15s.  (C++ is really hurt by garbage collection vs alloc/free.)  Switching C++ to use Google&#x27;s TCMalloc brought it down to 10s.<p>When you see a benchmark that says that X is faster than Java, and X does not include the letter C, take it with a pinch of salt!",1375895426

I agree that you shouldn&#x27;t identify with notions and ideas and labels, because that&#x27;s just dumb and putting the cart before the horse. But generally, and ignoring the sensibilities of HN? No to most of that.<p>I started to care about politics since I saw corpses being shoved into a mass grave with a caterpillar while switching TV channels when I was a kid, and it hasn&#x27;t let up since. Why should it? Politics by definition affects everyone, in ways that actually matter. Just take the web; it matters because it allows people to communicate, the people make it matter. Even more so with politics, which doesn&#x27;t just affect everybody, everybody owns an equal share of it. Most people let theirs rot, but they still own it, and if the circus around it has been made that complex and hidden among many bloated layers of euphemisms and misdirection, to encourage apathy and and facilitate deception, then those layers need to be removed, instead of removing the &quot;uneducated&quot; from the debate. If a simple but adult mind can&#x27;t understand it, something is fishy. Politics really isn&#x27;t that complex as some people would love to make it out to be, or at the very least, sophistry is not complexity, and this makes for a huge chunk of political debate and opinions. As Chomsky said in some talk or other.. when he talks with intellectuals they have a hard time understanding even the most basic stuff, while some peasants in South America for example get it right away. I guess their being on the receiving end of it, instead of trying to rationalize the bloodshed their own gloved hand is doling out (or the hand of the uncle in whose lap they&#x27;re sitting), helps.<p>Also, it reminds me of this quote:<p><i>The real damage is done by those millions who want to &#x27;survive.&#x27; The honest men who just want to be left in peace. Those who dont want their little lives disturbed by anything bigger than themselves. Those with no sides and no causes. Those who wont take measure of their own strength, for fear of antagonizing their own weakness. Those who dont like to make wavesor enemies. Those for whom freedom, honour, truth, and principles are only literature. Those who live small, mate small, die small. Its the reductionist approach to life: if you keep it small, youll keep it under control. If you dont make any noise, the bogeyman wont find you. But its all an illusion, because they die too, those people who roll up their spirits into tiny little balls so as to be safe. Safe?! From what? Life is always on the edge of death; narrow streets lead to the same place as wide avenues, and a little candle burns itself out just like a flaming torch does. I choose my own way to burn.</i><p>-- Sophie Scholl<p>Safe from what, indeed? From being incorrect? From being inefficient? From raised blood pressure? Why not try to be safe from standing for nothing? I don&#x27;t mean to be polemic but I truly don&#x27;t get it. What is a &quot;useful conversation&quot;? Useful for what, exactly? Talking about Javascript is terribly useless when it comes to being a decent person. Talking about being a decent person is terribly useless for debugging Javascript. If it has no potential to make anyone sad, angry or happy, it&#x27;s likely a gimmick in the bigger scheme of things. Which is fine for HN I guess, but not for general advice on what kind of person one should be. Thanks, but no thanks.",1375894831

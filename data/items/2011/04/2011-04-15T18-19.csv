From the book in Galt's Utopy:<p><pre><code>  The recaptured sense of her [Dagny's] own childhood kept coming back to her whenever she met the two sons of the young woman who owned the bakery shop. . . . They did not have the look she had seen in the children of the outer world--a look of fear, half- secretive, half-sneering, the look of a child's defense against an adult, the look of a being in the process of discovering that he is hearing lies and of learning to feel hatred. The two boys had the open, joyous, friendly confidence of kittens who do not expect to get hurt, they had an innocently natural, non-boastful sense of their own value and as innocent a trust in any stranger's ability to recognize it, they had the eager curiosity that would venture anywhere with the certainty that life held nothing unworthy of or closed to discovery, and they looked as if, should they encounter malevolence, they would reject it contemptuously, not as dangerous, but as stupid, they would not accept it in bruised resignation as the law of existence.</code></pre>",1302893799

There were 4 problems on the test, and one of them could only be solved either by being much smarter than me or by getting kind of lucky and very quickly divining the right, tricky way to factor the product of some characteristic functions.  I thought it was very non obvious.  When the class discussed the test there was a bimodal distn of scores on that question; 3 students, including me, got 1/2 credit and everyone else got 0 or full credit.  I asked a classmate how in the hell he figured out the problem in the very tight time limit for the test.  He basically told me that last year's test -- not distributed by the professor -- had almost an identical problem on it.  Once you'd seen the right way to factor the characteristic function the problem was trivial.  Pretty disappointing.",1302893409

For a long time Casinos, as service to their customers, didn't care if you played with another Casino's chips so you could just carry them around from place to place and play them. At the end of the day the Casinos would settle accounts and exchange chips and cash to make it all come out even. It was a great convenience and while occasionally people would try to counterfeit chips, at that time if you were caught doing that you literally disappeared. Of course businesses near the Casinos, 7-11, restaurants, etc, started accepting chips in lieu of cash since they could just walk next door and exchange them for cash. It was a kind of fun and ""just one of those things.""<p>And then the secret service came and said ""Under the constitution only the US Government can make a currency, stop accepting chips or go to jail."" And they did a few stings and there were some high profile wrist slaps (I don't think anyone <i>actually</i> went to jail) and the whole thing stopped.<p>Had the Liberty Dollar folks read that bit of history they would have seen where their enterprise was headed.<p>Relinquishing the right to create a currency was one of the pre-requisites to ratifying the Constitution [1] which took that power for the Federal government and removed it from the states and the citizenry.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/pss/2124065"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jstor.org/pss/2124065</a>",1302893083

2451586,comment,2449908,2449908,1,0,Tycho,,,"Here's my take:<p>Art starts where (prior) science/utility/craft/trade stops giving you answers.<p>Take an abstract painting. The only functional requirements are that it covers a canvas which you can hang on a wall, and that it will interest viewers. Beyond those things there are really no 'answers' or 'directions,' so the 'artistic territory' begins immediately. If you've ever tried to make an abstract painting, you'll know that even when you don't know what the hell you're painting, you still know there are bits you like and bits you don't. The art is in exploring this uncharted territory to create a whole work that somehow pleases, albeit due to little understood principles ('why is this splotch of green more appealing than that blob of red?').<p>Take another piece of visual art, say a portrait - it's supposed to capture the likeness of the person, as well as fit on a canvas etc., so there's a bit further to travel before you're in pure artistic territory. If it's a piece of graphic design, an architectural sketch, <i>most</i> of the journey is just applying techniques to capture the functional requirements.<p>In a discipline like maths or engineering, most people, most of the time, are working well within the established techniques, to solve problems that have been solved countless times before. You need to go a long way to reach the cutting edge, where mathematics can become an art.[1]<p>Programming, however, sits somewhere in between. While it's nothing like abstract art, as we <i>do</i> have vast sums of established knowledge, plus best practices, standard techniques, etc., I'd wager that most programming projects have a very large quotient of 'the unknown' (as evidenced by the failure and lateness rate of IT projects). Therefore programming is in large part an art - there are often no well trodden routes to success, but the great programmers always seem to get there. They tame the unknown, but not in a way that can easily be transmitted to other workers/programmers.<p>When you see a piece of embroidery, it's artistic in the sense that we don't know exactly why it is appealing, but the person who 'crafted' it was probably not exercising any great artistic expression, just repeating an old design. Just because something's functional requirement is to be aesthtically pleasing, doesn't mean it's a 'craft' which is intrinsically different from disciplines which lack that particular functional requirement. We need to rethink what we mean by art and non-art. In paintings or music, the jump-off point is almost immediate: you have few functional requirements, and few relatively rules to guarantee results. From there onwards it's down to insight/ability on a fleeting, individual basis. With other disciplines, you have many functional requirements and many rules/procedures that let you meet those requirements if followed diligently. Sometimes aesthetic appeal is one of the requirements, sometimes not. But there comes a point once again where only individual insight/ability can bring further progress. Our only choice is to rely on talented people.<p>Have you ever seen the film, 'A River Runs Through It?' It's about two estranged brothers who are reunited in adulthood, and they think back to years before when their father would take them fishing. Their father said the most important thing for a man to have was 'art.' He didn't mean owning pictures, or painting them, he meant whatever vocatoin/profession/trade you choose, you need to make an 'art' of it. The narrator/protagonist's brother (played by Brad Pitt) was a failed person in some respects, but he had developed an incredible technique/knack for fishing that nobody else understood. Thus, he 'had art.'<p>So anyway, programming does not usually involve aesthetic appeal as a functional requirement, but it is sometimes an 'art.' I would conclude therefore that we need to listen to the advice of our greatest artists... but you can never replace the art with a formula.<p>[1] of course, we very often operate on the edge of our <i>own</i> abilities, but until we've reached a frontier where no one else has gone, our 'art' wont deserve any audience",1302892343

Once you have that, basically check complexity: 1 word = no good. 2 words = ok, add a special character in there and a caps. 3 words = great. 3 words + special characters = awesome. etc.<p>Anyone can make one of these in a few hrs. and give error messages like:<p>""Your password is too short""<p>""your password is too simple for it's length, either make it longer or add special characters, numbers, and capitol letters""<p>""your password is made up of a single word or easily obtainable information about you based on information we have in our system, please change the words used or add more of them""<p>This means: (a) people understand why password is rejected and (b) people have choices and (c) increases probability that people won't forget their password.<p>Oh and any system that limits passwords to < 50 characters can fo f<i></i>k themselves. Too bad ADP (paystub) has a policy of 6-12 characters. Thats right limitations, and I have to use that crap. Is a 4000 byte database column that expansive nowdays?<p>Furthermore... Changing password every 1-3-6 months is also bad. WHY? Simple, very very simple: 99% of the time you will have one of the following situations:<p>- The same password is used + an extra 1 or 2 characters.<p>- The same password is used + different capitalizations.<p>- A different password is used + post-it note.<p>- The user will forget their password immediately.<p>The TRUE answer to the reason why it policies are the way they are is because people don't want to think. ""Tom did it this way, it must be secure."" ""I don't really understand it, so whatever, its the standard, it must work.""<p>To make passwords secure they need to enact the policies I stated + a second factor for authentication. If you log in from an ""unknown"" location (a new one) just send them an email, or sms, or something that gives some key to enter to authorize. This will work in letting people know there is a breach, change pw on need, don't make ppl change passwords nonestop. Lots of advantages.<p>Wow writing this I feel like we need a startup that provides this exact solution.

2451568,comment,2450973,2451342,26,0,swannodette,,,"I agree with Peter Van Roy on this - mainstream programmers tend to have an unclear picture of the relationship between syntax and semantics. This goes for both C-style and whitespace based mainstream languages. Every syntax brings along hard-wired semantics like a ball and chain. But the ball is not particularly heavy, in fact sometimes it's light enough to not be much of a bother. This actually explains quite a few things - people tend to be satisfied with whatever language they've become comfortable with (in fact they get angry if somebody actually points out the ball and chain). The few people that actually take the time to learn several dramatically different languages discover that ball and chains come in all different kinds of shapes and sizes.<p>But I believe there is a sea change going on and Lisp will only benefit from it. That sea change is Functional Programming. Functional Programming is very much concerned with optimal semantics. The more people understand that semantics and syntax are inextricably intertwined the sooner they'll see that Lisp has been and continues to be one of the best ways to rapidly prototype and build optimal semantics.<p><i>But this also means Lispers need to constantly look at other languages</i> - the optimal semantics are constantly evolving and changing (Racket and Clojure are doing a good job of adopting better semantics).<p>On that note, I'd like to say that you've done an incredible job at pointing out that the ball and chain is there to far more mainstream programmers than anyone else I know.

But what about the giant issue hardly anyone mentions: real world experience.<p>...<p>My advice to a young hacker with lots of skill but not much experience (outside of college apps): you may want to consider getting a job for a year or two. I know, everyone wants to start the next <whatever>, and get rich now and no one wants to sit in Megacorp's cube farm. And a startup, even a failed one, may be a better education.<p>OTOH, you will acquire dozens of great startup ideas (and contacts) and avoid the ""me too"" trap. Something to think about.</i><p>I found myself nodding in agreement as I read it, but I've been sitting here for 5 years in Megacorp's cube farm and I still don't think I have ""real world experience.""  Part of the reason may be because this particular industry (aerospace) is also its own echo chamber in many ways, but I think I'm missing something.<p>Some people can enter a large organization, learn a lot of domain knowledge, and spot the pain points that can be solved with technology -- and potentially turn that into a lucrative startup or consulting career.  Good for them.  But these are the sort of ""pain points"" that I notice here:<p>- An extreme level of Not-Invented-Here Syndrome.  I could not even get approval to use LAPACK for linear algebra computations.  This ends up with a lot of wasted energy implementing things that have already been done, and probably much better than an in-house solution too.<p>- A stifling bureaucracy.  It takes months of paperwork to get new hardware or software.  All along the chain are little fiefdoms of people who will invent processes and regulations to justify their paychecks.<p>- A misalignment of incentives.  Ideas get shot down because they threaten somebody's career.  Buggy, unstable software gets declared a ""roaring success"" because nobody will own up to failure.<p>- A lack of honest communication between users, customers, management, and developers.  Sure, it might be true that all enterprise software is like this, but it's clear that a lot of misunderstanding could be avoided (and the associated cost of doing the wrong thing could be saved).<p>If these are the pain points of an organization, I don't see how it helps me in any way.  There's two issues:<p>(1) These are social problems, not technical, and they probably won't be solved with software.<p>(2) Even if there exists a software solution, there's probably no way to sell it short of employing a sales team that costs $50,000+ to make a deal (cf. Joel's article on pricing, http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html).<p>Yes, these are ""real world"" problems, but I don't see how I'm getting any useful ""real world experience"" out of this sort of environment.

The benefits of a university have nothing to do with being a monopoly on knowledge, because nowadays such a thing doesn't exist. The benefits, in my opinion, include:<p>1. <i>Credentialing</i>. I believe this is the number one reason people go to college today. Not to learn, but to obtain a degree that proves some indefinable quality about yourself - that you have a certain level of competence, are persistent, etc. I've heard it described as a ""social signalling ritual.""<p>2. <i>Mentorship</i>. If you work closely with a good professor, you can get a lot out of it. I'm a member of a research lab and have weekly meetings with my advisor; these meetings usually devolve to picking his brain for career advice. Also, when you self-teach, it's harder to know when you're wrong than when you have someone to tell you.<p>3. <i>Perseverance</i>. 4 years can be a hell of a long time.<p>Of course, no one actually signs up for a ""random class"" - you're not throwing darts at a course catalog or anything. If you're really interested in something, take a class in it. That's the only way to figure out which classes are worth taking and which ones aren't. I will, however, point you to this pg essay on which subjects are worth studying [1] that I really enjoyed. My favorite part: ""Yes, of course, you'll learn something by taking a psychology class. The point is, you'll learn more by taking a class in another department.""<p>One last thing: look through the list of departments. Look at and consider <i>every</i> department before you decide which one you want to spend time in. As a Biology student, looking back, I think Biological Engineering would've been a lot cooler to study, but now I'm not in a position to switch.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/college.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/college.html</a>",1302890468

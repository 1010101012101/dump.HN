The last codebase I worked on - written in Django - was appallingly bad. That's no fault in any way of Django, but no framework is going to save you from poor coders, last-minute rushed requirements, chronic technical debt, or lack of investment in refactoring.",1339059597

Our product is a business administration platform for the Field Services world, we are hoping to launch into private beta within a few weeks.<p>My established business is a bit of a hybrid. We have two offices in the UK and a distributed workforce of about 20 working at home. I really get to see both the advantages and disadvantages of office / home working. It works for us, but we have been doing this for a long time and I wonder if I am being blinded by the convenience factor.<p>With Powered Now I have a distributed team, half of us are in the UK the other half are based in Budapest, we try to meet up to work together once every 4 to 6 weeks. When we do its insanely productive, but I wonder if it would be better if we were under the same roof?<p>If you believe the guys at 37 signals home working is the way forward, and to some extent I believe them, its enabled us to go to the best people instead of hiring in a limited area. However I'd be interested in your stories, have you consolidated a team into an office, or did you do the reverse? Are our productive meetups that good because they are a relatively rare event or would it be like that every day? Also if you were founding a startup today, how would you do it?<p>I'd love to hear your stories and advice.<p>Thanks,<p>Ben",1339059022

4078044,comment,4077891,4077891,9,0,citricsquid,,,"> It would be trivial to do some rudimentary parsing on the url string to determine where you really wanted to go<p>Specific to this point, a new project I'm building supports ""pretty"" URLs and I've found my (now) <i>favourite</i> solution is to build an aliases system.<p>It works like so: when a user creates an item an ""alias"" is registered, it's set to ""current"" and all future queries to that alias are logged. If the user causes a change to the URL in future (name change, etc.) then the new alias is registered but the old one is retained and 301s to the new alias. All aliases are accessible by the user and they can invalidate them manually (if they want to re-use an alias for example) <i>however</i> if an alias has had a large amount of hits from a single source <i>since</i> that alias was retired (say 50 referrals from website.com to mysite.com/previous-alias) the system assumes that the user posted the link on another website and so invalidating that alias will cause a dead link (and lose my site traffic) so it doesn't allow it.<p>I guess it's convoluted and adds extra overhead but I feel like if you have pretty URLs (which are in my opinion something that a website should aim for) you need to be in a position where they're not going to cause the site to break the rest of the internet. The easy solution is to have <i>pseudo</i> pretty URLs (eg: website.com/123-pretty-url, where 123 = ID and pretty-url is just an ignored string) or just not allow URLs to ever be changed, but I don't like either.<p>I wonder if any other websites have a good approach to this.",1339056667

It's much faster I think, and I'm used to it.

Make no mistake, I love the design - it's perhaps the best design of an Android app yet. BUT, you can't compare it to any game or video playback app - it does not have to handle native libraries or fight with gazillion different screen aspects. It might not even contain a single custom drawn view (don't know about the ""reader"" view). Everything in Android is a fluid layout, and if you only use these layout components, everything should be fine on most devices. Pocket is even able to avoid very large images, which tend to crash older devices if they exceed available native bitmap storage. So.. yes, most apps won't need testing on ~4000 devices - if it runs on the emulator, it should be fine (make sure to severely limit memory there).<p>But don't dare to leave the well-tread pathways, or get ready to buy 100 or more devices (obviously that's an estimation :)).",1339056242

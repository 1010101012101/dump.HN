Once people started trying to compile certain open-source crypto applications, and found that their binaries weren&#x27;t byte-for-byte replicas, it begged the question: Am I actually encrypting my confidential data with a surreptitiously hobbled program? Is there a covert plot to infiltrate and sabotage these sorts of software projects? How would I know if the encryption was weakened in a subtle way, when I don&#x27;t have the resources to try and crack it at levels that demand well-funded hardware?<p>But, I wonder, is this something to worry about everywhere?<p>Is this why so many projects are now taking on this additional activity?<p>Is there a panic and an anxiety driving this trend, or are we just crossing dotting our i&#x27;s and our crossing our t&#x27;s with yet another set of best practices?",1449377162

10684431,comment,10682632,10684258,0,0,saurik,,,"FWIW, LLVM was a thing before Apple got involved (and I remember the project from them, back when it really was a &quot;low-level virtual machine&quot; as its primary purpose). They hired the guy who ran that project and then essentially took over, and have on occasion run &quot;rough shod&quot; over the community: they built their ARM64 backend in secret for the iPhone 5S and essentially forced Google and others to spend a lot of time building out a quality AArch64 toolchain for that same architecture, which everyone else did as part of a public community. When everyone else was pretty much done Apple finally decided they were ready to open source their backend, and used their steering of the project to stall a lot of things while the work was merged. They also had a chilling effect on some developers in the open ecosystem by saying they were going to open source their work: you can find mailing list posts from people saying they didn&#x27;t want to waste their time as Apple would be providing theirs, which of course they did much much later than they originally scheduled. FWIW, I don&#x27;t entirely blame Apple here as evil or anything, as I can appreciate &quot;we are the first to care about this chip and we really did all this work ourselves and it would be really demotivating for someone else to just watch us slave away at it and then still be able to come out with a final product only months after us because we gave it away&quot;, but they certainly don&#x27;t deserve the kind of props you bestow upon them by claiming they &quot;open sourced&quot; that project :/.",1449377121

I didn&#x27;t have any negative experience/memory when I was learning mathematics (and science) at school; instead, I always felt comfortable with any STEM related course/subject. But I had a very miserable  experience when I had to learn English as a second language[1] at school.<p>At that time, I started strongly believing in the idea that no matter what I do, I will never be able to learn English as ESL as it always felt like an alien subject (literally :-)) and there was nothing I can use to get a handle on it. No wonder, I felt nervous and hopeless in my English classes.<p>Somehow I was able to reach college (in my country it corresponds to the grade 11-12 of high school education in most western countries) with shear brute force[2]. In the 11th grade, for the very first time, I had an English language teacher who gave me some <i>hope</i> that one can learn and overcome all language related problems. Though he only taught English literature (which can be more intimidating when one is at beginners&#x27; level with lots of self-doubts and anxiety), his teaching style was really inspiring[3] and it changed my whole perspective about learning a new language. Later on, I realized that it wasn&#x27;t my (or other students who couldn&#x27;t afford tuition fees of private ESL teachers) faults that couldn&#x27;t learn the language, it was the teachers&#x27; fault as they were not really qualified to be English language teachers, at the very first place.<p>Now I feel quite comfortable with English language[4] and afore-mentioned story is only a memory now, one from the distant past.<p>---<p>1- to be precise, it was my third language I had to learn at school in a non-English-speaking country; I lived in a deprived part of the country and had a financially humble background.<p>2- memorized anything English related to get into the next class and didn&#x27;t let any English language related handicaps stop my progress.<p>3- at-least that&#x27;s how I felt at that time. I distinctly remember, some of the students, I personally knew, were only finding insignificant flaws in his English language related skills.<p>4- I&#x27;m very far away from being an expert in English language but I&#x27;m very happy with my progress I&#x27;ve made till now.",1449375600

Strangely, the public has been relatively unaware of this development and the ensuing debate. The researchers made genetically modified human embryos as a research exercise and let them develop for only a few days in the lab. But if someone else followed suit and simply implanted the CRISPR’d human embryos into a surrogate, then boom—we may have the first GMO sapiens.&quot;</i>",1449374984

10684380,comment,10683580,10683580,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"From my perspective the elephant in the room is something Tesla is unlikely to be able to compete against, particularly as more manufacturers come online with viable full range electric cars:  Constant innovation.<p>What I mean by that is car companies are geared-up and used to introducing new and seriously updated models every year or two.  They go through many iterations and designs, have hits and misses.  And they sell millions of cars per year in the process.<p>In another year or two the Model S will feel, well, dated and old.  I have to admit having had this very thought.  I&#x27;ve been considering purchasing one for the past year and was going to make a decision in January.  And I keep running in circles with multiple arguments in my head.<p>First there&#x27;s the &quot;this look is getting old&quot; argument.  Sorry, superficial, but, hey, that&#x27;s the way it works.  This this wasn&#x27;t a real-life criteria we all use to buy cars they would still look the way they did twenty years ago because nobody would care.<p>Then there&#x27;s the interior.  As others have pointed out, not the best. I&#x27;ll just leave it at that.<p>I find my self less interested in a car who&#x27;s outward and interior design is already several years old.<p>I am not interested in a Tesla because I am a fan boy.  I am not.  I would like an electric car because I have a nice solar infrastructure at home that I designed to be able to support two electric cars.  I also want to stop burning fossil fuel for transportation.  I am also very interested in lane-keeping or auto-pilot technologies while on a highway.  And, finally, it is a business decision based on facts:  I find myself driving quite a few miles per week and, if you do the math, going electric just makes sense.<p>Then there&#x27;s the question of battery technology.  I can&#x27;t help but think we are not very far from a shift in battery technology.  I, frankly, don&#x27;t want to find myself in two or three years with a US $90K Tesla sporting an outdated battery, outdated exterior and outdated interior and a tough resale landscape because Toyota, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes, Porsche, Ford, GM and even Yugo (raise your hand if you remember them) has a pure electric with 200+ mile range for $40K.<p>All car companies know how to make electrics.  It ain&#x27;t that difficult when compared to making IC cars.  In fact, if you already have a well-tuned infrastructure to build the rest of the car efficiently --which all other car companies have in droves-- building an electric car is actually simpler.<p>Tesla&#x27;s SUV?  Please.  It&#x27;s a joke.",1449374904

So it wouldn&#x27;t have any effect on its own, being unenforceable vague.<p>But that&#x27;s not the point.<p>Now, note carefully how the legislation starts:\n<i>&quot;In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the following:&quot;</i><p>See THAT: In LIEU OF the matter (&quot;the matter&quot; being ALL of SA 2874, the Obamacare repeal).<p>The parent bill is H.R.3762 - Restoring Americans&#x27; Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015, which had NOTHING to do with terrorism, or guns.  That&#x27;s the first clue right there.<p>Congressional Democrats have used this tactic (overwriting legislation they oppose with <i>unrelated</i> content that sounds obviously beneficial in order to trick the media into carrying water for their politicking) clear back to the Tom Foley days, if not Tip O&#x27;Neill or beyond.<p>The ignorant media consumers have been duped, successfully, because few bother to look at the bills...<p>...which, in this case, took me all of about 8-10 clicks in total.",1449374743

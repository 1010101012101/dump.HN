Lets say I'm a selfishly amoral actor in the room rental industry, and I want to lock up the market for myself. I can silence all my competition by releasing blacklist information on a number of current users, then those users will be banned by other sites and forced to continue using my site.<p>Banks do this today with their info sharing through ChexSystems. I've seen banks that will report their current account holders for the most trivial violations. The result being that the account holder can't open an account anywhere else.",1311976765

My family is decidedly upper-upper-middle class, and I won't pretend that cutting my taxes will stimulate the economy.  Extra money is going into loan repayment or savings.

Especially when everything is, fact for fact, true?<p>I had a HN account for a few months, my posts were getting generally positive responses.  Then I made a comment containing  criticism of the YC startup the article was about.  I think it was fair criticism, I just gave my reasons I couldn't trust their service enough to use it.  It was my highest-rated comment ever, and sparked a fair bit of discussion so I think the community tended to at least agree that I had a point.  The next day HN got a lot slower and every new comment I made stayed at 1 point permanently and were never replied to.  It seemed funny, I was used to getting at least a few points on my quickest made comments.  When I logged out everything was fast again and my new comments were nowhere to be seen.  I had been shaddowbanned and slowbanned.<p>So your question should not be ""Is YC simply going to..."".  They already do that.",1311976507

In my scenario, money flowed but did not help the economy.  In your scenario, you're assuming the $1000 was spent and then following the trail of its expenditure.  But if the money is never spent, none of that revenue will ever get to the government.<p>I also think you might be wrong about the legality of a tax-free wealth transfer.  According to this site, Romania has no gift tax.<p><a href=""http://www.cfe-eutax.org/taxation/gift-tax/romania"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cfe-eutax.org/taxation/gift-tax/romania</a><p>And if we are extending the metaphor to wealthy individuals and corporations, they have plenty of people on staff to help avoid or minimize taxes.  Ironically, I also read that Banks are specifically excluded from the VAT in Romania.<p>> <i>Companies also pay taxes on investments or sunken costs, not only salaries. So if Apple brings home some of those billions, but acquires some U.S. company, than a lot of money will still go as taxes.</i><p>I'm pretty sure that's not the case.  If Apple brings home those billions, they'll pay whatever taxes are owed for that profit.  They won't pay extra if they then use the remaining money to buy up another company.<p>As for why Romania is doing better than Greece, I think it has a lot to do with the fact that Greece's debt is about 144% of its GDP while Romania's is about 34%.<p><a href=""https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2186rank.html?countryName=Romania&countryCode=ro&regionCode=eur&rank=83#ro"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/...</a><p>Romania's revenue/expense ratio is also better than Greece's.

2823873,comment,2823781,2823781,1,0,ISeemToBeAVerb,,,"Personally, I think the best approach to learning RoR is to learn the basics of Ruby first, then move on to Rails.  It also helps to work on your own project.<p>Tutorials are ok, but I find them more useful as a tool to see how someone else would approach a particular problem, as opposed to a learning tool.  The reason I say that is because many tutorials breeze through important concepts for the sake of brevity.<p>Picking a simple project and using books or online info to work through the process is, in my opinion, the best way to actually learn.  Once you have a grasp on the language, start looking for good code examples and study those.  In the end, the more you read and write code, the better you'll be.  I'd say you could certainly make good headway in a week with a schedule like you describe.",1311974826

For example Sim City, Rome Total War, Battlefield 3 and other FPSs, Farmville etc. If you're wasting your life playing a videogame, might as well learn something about the real world.<p>- Journalism and PR: how to provide objective journalism through new tools like data analysis, computer models, simulators etc. Use historical analysis to put events in context. Get rid of sources of drama, like writers and editors and focus on charts. Those can be read and debunked quicker, various opinions/biases could be compared more clearly. A report about a murder should be a chart that includes the murder rate in nation, city, area, show population growth, poverty etc. A report on political affairs would show money paid to politicians, estimate # of lobbyists involved, size of affected market, etc. Reduce talking heads and drama to minimum.<p>- Suburban Sprawl: popularize condos instead of individual homes to contain suburbia. Better mortgage rates for condos, advertise urban services, cost of living without car, etc.<p>- Family planning site: encourage a smaller population. Give coupons to small families. Many governments have such programs, you'd make them easier to use at least.<p>- Obesity: coupons, money saving for buying proper food instead of processed carbs and fast food.<p>- Internet addiction: psychoanalyze internet users through traffic stats etc. Figure out how to get them off, maybe through exercise program, nature getaway, new experiences.<p>Personally I'm suspicious of attempts to solve problems in the developing world that aren't part of some all around solution. Making it easier to grow food, access to water without a simultaneous plan to lower population size seems like a dangerous game.

There's something about minbufexpl's list that seems unappealing to me when it spans multiple lines.  I also have CTRL-j/CTRL-k mapped to :bnext/:bprev.  As for closing a buffer, my main window generally has a single vertical split, so I have the following kludge:<p><pre><code>    map <C-Q> :vert split<CR>:bnext<CR>:wincmd l<CR>:bdelete<CR>
</code></pre>
This creates another vertical window temporarily, advances to the next buffer in that window, activates the window to the right (which still shows the buffer I'm trying to kill), and then deletes that buffer leaving me with two windows again.  Amusingly, my older machines were slow enough to catch a glimpse of the third window, but it disappears too quickly to see on my new machine.<p>[1] <a href=""http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=42"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=42</a><p>edit: described kludge a bit better",1311973967

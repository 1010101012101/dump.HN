67891,comment,67826,67826,0,0,alex_c,,,"Seems to me like Slashdot's comment system does two things that might address many of the problems you mention:<p>- instead of ""Up"" or ""Down"", the voting is a bit more granular - ""+1 Informative"", ""-1 Flamebait"" etc.  The UI isn't MUCH more complicated - instead of a ""vote up / vote down"" link you have a dropdown.<p>- Voting points are a limited resource - assigned to ""reliable users"" randomly and expire after a few days.  This makes it a bit harder to get a core of power users who are practically guaranteed to be voted up.  As a bonus, the scarcity probably means that people are more likely to use their votes ""wisely"".<p>I wonder if something like this has been tried for selecting the front-page stories on a social news site, and how well it would work.  As far as I know everyone's following Digg's model.",1192419460

67886,comment,67826,67884,0,0,waleedka,,,"Well said. I need to think about this hard and deep. Obviously, this is a perfect-world scenario. Let's see how close we can get to it.\n",1192418921
67885,comment,67826,67875,0,0,yters,,,"I didn't say it's a complete solution, otherwise we'd never have disagreements, wars, etc.  But, it's the closest we'll get to a solution.<p>That being said, I think algorithms can be very effective as intelligence amplifiers, allowing us to make higher level decisions and micro manage less.",1192418821
67884,comment,67826,67879,0,0,aston,,,"So then you've articulated exactly the type of site I'd love to see. I don't want to be asked what to see, I want to know I'm seeing everything I'm interested in seeing. And I don't want to see things I don't want to see. And, as an added bonus, I'd like the appearance of my input meaning something, too.",1192418495

67882,comment,67826,67874,0,0,waleedka,,,"I see your point. So how about this: a community for people who like science, and another one for those who like politics, and so on. And, then, you choose to be a member of the science, astronomy, and politics clubs, and I choose to join the science and startups clubs. At least this is what I want to build. ",1192418467
67881,comment,67826,67857,0,0,aston,,,"Not the best comparison. I don't see why a person would vote something up that they have no interest in personally. Altruism isn't all that common.",1192418365
67880,comment,67803,67814,0,0,inklesspen,,,"IANAL, but I believe he is referring to the downsides of a standard form contract. The courts have put some limitations on such contracts, because one side gets to dictate the terms, and the other side cannot negotiate; he can only sign it or go home.<p>That said, I'm sure YC is going to make a fair contract. It's in their best interests for the startup to suceed, after all.",1192418344
67879,comment,67826,67873,0,0,waleedka,,,"> I'd rather not have to pick my communities.<p>That's a true challenge due to how we make decisions. We, generally, don't want to feel that we're missing out on something. We want to get ALL the news. Although, in reality, we don't. By reading this site we're missing out on what's being said on many other interesting web sites, and we're okay with that. However, faced with the question: Do you want ALL the news or SOME news, we tend to choose the first. \n",1192417949
67878,comment,67826,67845,0,0,samson,,,"I agree, systems like digg and alot of other voting sites, don't seem to create alot of invested time for the users. <p>What I mean is, the data they have the opportunity to collect and use to benefit the individual would make users infinitly more loyal, and reduce the chance of them being overly liberal in their voting habits. The reason being is that they'd CARE. My argument then if I had one to begin with is that users don't care about the system because there's nothing invested in it for them. Yes..Yes..the community..I know, but whats in it for them to make them care.",1192417760

They then said a customer needed a refund, and they wanted her to wire her advance to Nigeria.\nThe problem is...now she has a cheque, assumes its some sort of scam, but what if it clears?<p>Was someone else scammed and she is the middleman?  Is it legit?",1192417517
67875,comment,67826,67861,0,0,aston,,,"That's a bit generous, I think. Most people aren't smart at all. And even the ones that are don't act objectively and without bias. Ever. <p>Although I will admit that moderated solutions almost always come out better. See slashdot's complete lack of this problem.",1192417421
67874,comment,67826,67870,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Edited: <p>I think my point was more that people have ""favorite"" topics, but it's a loose and free-flowing thing, not a rigid structure. Computers are really good at rigid definitions, while people may be amenable to all kinds of fuzziness. Perhaps my group is better defined as ""people who like science, astronomy, politics, and startups"" -- but that wouldn't be the topics of the articles! The topics of the articles I like could be anything. And over time, I might add or subtract the stuff I like, even without being consciously aware of it. Heck, I'm not even sure I'm able to give you a precise list of topics I'm interested in, much less self-select against a preconceived ontology.",1192417263

The change makes the site a bit harder to consume - particularly, skimming-quickly-for-a-couple-good-points is harder.<p>But it makes the site much nicer to participate in. First, I don't feel the need to reply to mean, nasty, or incorrect replies to me unless I have something to add. Second - and I think this is really nice - voting has become less about promoting an argument or viewpoint and more about saying ""thanks for this"" or ""less of this, please"" - I find myself voting up thoughtful stuff I disagree with more often now, and voting less frequently overall.<p>Personally, I'd say the site is harder to consume efficiently now, but more pleasant to interact with.<p>--<p>It'd be interesting to see voting by people who are regular/frequent commentors vs. mostly lurkers, if there was a way to segment it out somehow.

2595781,comment,2595605,2595605,32,0,cygwin98,,,"I have a theory that showing comment scores benefits each individual member, especially lurkers (myself included); on the contrary, hiding them will be good for the HN community in the long run, however, each of us will have to sacrifice a bit more of our time.<p>Here is what I observed during the past two months:<p>1. I have been more and more inclined to participate conversations, without fearing being outgunned by those celebrities. In old days, almost every thread touched by one of top members quickly becomes a one-man show, other comments (may be more insightful) got somewhat ignored. The consequence is that a lot of us just don't bother to write a word. Now, they are still there, but the herding effect has been much less since, so their advantages are not as obvious as before. The game is more fair. For example, I saw one thread today patio11 was using his BCC as an example, a guy was asking what BCC was. I don't think this will happen in old days if the guy saw patio11's comment had say 300ish upvotes.<p>2. Those celebrities are not as thoughtful and knowledgeable as what I used to think. I have nothing against them. They gained their fame because they are experts in certain areas and they gave insightful comments there. However, the issue is that they may not be experts in other areas. Without the scores being shown, comments are evaluated in a more fair way, based on its intrinsic value rather than who their owners are. I saw a lot of comments that have spelling error here and there, may not be worded properly, but are really insightful. I appreciate those comments and gladly upvote them. I doubt I would have patience to read them if scores were being shown, more likely, I gloss over them and just skip them because of those minor issues.<p>In summary, showing scores brings short-term gains to the members, discourages participation and encourages lurking. HN will become cliques around a few key members.",1306636318

For instance, am I mindful of not having an avg. karma that makes me look like a twit? Sure. But do I let that keep me from posting comments that I wish to post, just because I fear they will get low ratings? No, I know that things will tend to work out overall, because from what I've observed, if you make an honest effort to not be a total idiot on here, you will end up with a decent rating.<p>I trust the userbase, basically. It saddens me that so many users here, apparently including some of the site's creators and authority figures, seem to lack such faith to an extent that makes them want to hide features of the site from the userbase, even though a strong majority of the userbase says they want to see those features, in poll after poll, without exception.<p>I understand that the users are not always right, and that one can often achieve better results from ignoring the userbase.

2595776,comment,2594422,2594422,1,0,tzs,,,"I'm a bit concerned about the form of the copyright clause. It says it is creating a ""work for hire"", but then goes on to clearly describe something that is NOT a ""work for hire"".<p>If a work is a ""work for hire"", the employer IS THE AUTHOR as far as copyright law is concerned. As soon as the work is fixed in a tangible medium of expression (i.e., as soon as the programmer types the code in his editor) the copyright springs into existence, and the owner of that copyright is the employer. See 17 USC 201(b).<p>The clause in the article talks about the copyright being transferred to the employer after the contractor is paid, and says that before that the copyright is owned by the contractor. In other words, it is NOT a work for hire.<p>From the discussion in the article, the purpose for this clause is so that if the employer does not pay, the contractor can use copyright law against them. Thus it is clear that the contractor in fact does not wish to create a work for hire situation.<p>So why use the ""work for hire"" language? You are just asking for trouble--in a dispute the employer will argue that you intended to create a work for hire situation and that the other language about transferring rights should be tossed out (contract ambiguities generally are interpreted against the drafter).<p>I don't think they would succeed in this, but why the heck would you want to even give them it as an issue?",1306636230

2595707,comment,2595605,2595605,188,0,mdasen,,,"This wasn't my idea (someone else had posted it), but I think it would be nice to see the usernames fade from grey to green as the comment score increases (maybe capping at 10 or 15).  That way, one can quickly scan and see the best comments, but there isn't such a direct relationship as a numerical score.  For example, the username could go through these steps:<p><pre><code>  004400\n  005500\n  006600\n  . . .\n  00EE00\n  00FF00\n</code></pre>\nThat way one can even faster pick out things that people have generally agreed is of good value, but it isn't immediately obvious what the exact score is - there's a fuzzyness to it - and there's also a cap on the displayed score (in that you can't get more green than 00FF00 and starting at 004400 would cap it at 12).<p>It fits my use cases which are skimming for good comments and figuring out if something I don't know much about has value (for example, if someone says, ""they should have done it this way. . ."", it can act as a barometer of the suggestion's value).  It also seems like it would be easy enough to implement.<p>I'm not going to vote on the poll because I've actually found that the level of discussion has felt better without the votes shown.  I enjoy the site more for the reason you've cited.  Not to psycho-analyze too much, but the lack of vote scores removes the pressure to have the best comment or a better score than someone that has a different perspective.  Even if two people are being totally respectful to start with, it can become psychologically difficult when the other person is getting more votes.  One might try to make it a debate (that they're trying to win against the other person) more than a discussion (in which two parties are trying to figure out the truth together).<p>However, the site has become a bit less utilitarian and it sometimes does take me longer to weed through the information in the thread.  Maybe varying the color of the usernames based on the comment score (and capping at 12) would add some limitations and fuzzyness to it that would meld the two.  Capping at 12 would mean that both parties arguing might get the same public presentation of 00FF00 and that might quell the need for parties to prove that they're the winner of the argument by popular vote.  Likewise, humans don't perceive colors exactly and that might add another layer that would diminish people comparing themselves so much and trying to score points.  I guess I think it would be interesting to see if this would be a nice balance.<p>Example: A person posts that they think VPSs are better for hosting than renting a physical box and they talk about their reasoning (machine images that you can bring up more boxes of, launching new instances within minutes, whatnot) and it's a good comment.  Someone replies espousing the virtues of physical hardware (a tad more speed, not sharing IO, whatnot).  Now it becomes a bit of a competition between the two ideas (and the two posters).  They were both good, valuable comments about different approaches.  There is no right answer and there might not even be a better answer.  The community knows this and both have comment scores above 12, but each person feels pressure to ""win"".  With the green usernames, they're both at 00FF00 and have no idea if the community has given the other person more votes.  There's no need to score points off each other or need to defend one's ego.  You know you've made a valuable contribution and the other person has also, but for all you know they've gotten a good fewer votes than you.  It still allows everyone reading the two comments to know that they're both generally good advice.  So, there isn't a fight and an on-looker can see that both comments should be read and headed.",1306634538

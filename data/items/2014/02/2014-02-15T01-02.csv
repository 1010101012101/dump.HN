The less impact it has, the less beneficial you can expect energy policies to be to the environment.

While protesters are being attacked by paramilitary groups and government forces, TV stations show soap operas and cartoons.  Also, the government often makes nationwide broadcasts that forces all channels to show the same pro-government content (a &quot;cadena&quot;, which literally means &quot;chain&quot;.) This effectively leaves the population misinformed at the most critical moments, the country only has social networks to find out about abuses from the regime.<p>Some newspapers are still critical of the government, but I&#x27;m surprised to see many of them switch sides possibly because they&#x27;ve either been bought or blackmailed.

When in reality, there are many, many companies that have strong company cultures without somehow alienating a large number of otherwise qualified prospective employees.<p>Speaking as a person with a fair chunk of experience managing software development, I find it difficult to believe that management&#x27;s only choices are frat-boy culture or soul-sucking bland corporation.<p>I&#x27;ll speak very frankly. When a company has a half dozen or a dozen employees, when a company is scrambling for traction, it can be a great motivator to have a strong insider culture. Steve Jobs hung a pirate flag up at the Macintosh offices for a reason.<p>But companies grow, and part of growing is, well, growing. You need to select from a larger pool of prospective employees. You need to bring in some new DNA instead of doubling up on the DNA you already have.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to this specific company, but as a general principle, successful companies become less exclusive and possible--I am not speaking about Dropbox--less discriminatory as they grow.<p>If you want an example, look at Apple.

Sure you&#x27;ll know how to push the gas pedal and turn the steering wheel. You&#x27;ll even learn how to brake, but it is utterly boring  and shows very little on real life driving.<p>My first personal projects where about downloading... files from irc networks and finding words for online scrabble games and little things like that. It allows you to make mistakes and get into design troubles. You learn what is nice with a GUI and how it eventually sucks to have spaghetti code. It is a real problem, not just a a spooky thing you read about in programming books. Examples and tutorials do not allow for that. They automatically guide you to the right choices with or without reason, but you will not have experienced the failures of the wrong choices and their implications. But most of all, I kept hacking those projects because they interested me deeply. I wanted those &quot;files&quot; and I wanted to best everyone with a fast scrabble solver.<p>These days, the only reason I read tutorials like these is when I have chosen the language I need for a project to use but don&#x27;t have enough knowledge on how to use it and never the other way around. Find a goal first, then worry about the journey, even if &quot;it is about the journey&quot;, otherwise you&#x27;ll be making laps in a parking lot and eventually give up.",1392426686

What about uploading it into the cloud?Surely transferring 3 million GB at around 40 MB/sec would lower the average?<p>Edit: My calculations say it'll take 2.7 years to read all that data if you go at 40MBps.

He's only agreeing with that premise (<i>with praise</i>) and disagreeing with the all-positive conclusion wrought from that premise. Again: the only unconfirmed assumption here is one that <i>most people</i> including <i>the author being responded to</i> have made.<p>Also, we're talking about something Zed posted to his own personal blog.  Is Zed not allowed to post what he thinks to his own personal blog?  What ""reasonable justification"" is required to publish your own opinion on the internet?",1250856102

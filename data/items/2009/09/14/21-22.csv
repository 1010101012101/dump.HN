822695,comment,822492,822492,0,0,modeless,,,"Yes, X11 is backwards compatible and that's been really great for the Linux desktop.  But the article bashes Windows for rapidly introducing new APIs even though the old ones remain compatible; I'm just pointing out that Linux does that too.<p>As for the audio situation, the problem is sharing between multiple apps.  ALSA sucks at it so ""sound servers"" were invented but they caused more problems than they solved.  Now it seems like every distro has a different sound solution, and meanwhile OSS was never removed from the kernel so you can't even rely on ALSA always being there.<p>The filesystem problem can't be blamed wholly on apps or kernel devs; IMHO the problem really lies in POSIX which doesn't specify a way to achieve what app developers need in a way that can also be easily implemented in the kernel with good performance.  I would argue that the behaviors app developers were using became a de facto part of POSIX and the way kernel devs broke them was irresponsible even if it didn't break the letter of the standard.  Contrast with Microsoft which goes far, far out of its way to avoid breaking apps even when they flagrantly violate good practices (there are some great examples on The Old New Thing: <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/</a> ).",1252965373

Obviously not this one, and just as obviously no one knows or cares. Not ONCE does the author stop to wonder what services the actual users actually need; it's only about what this guy thinks MIGHT comply with some random ""design"" rules. One wonders if the users even exist as anything other than just another abstraction, and wondering about what problems those users might actually be trying to solve is right out.<p>Object Oriented Design can be seen as a case of reusing a cliche and butchering it at the same time, with the cliche being the shooting of ones self in the foot, and the butchery being the placement of said foot squarely upon the face of beauty immediately before pulling the trigger.",1252964049

Your saying you wouldn't expect it.  Well, that is a problem if two different programmers using the same classes have two different views of the object's behavior.  This can happen with any implementation of any class.<p>2 - ""If you have cached computations that depend on the rectangles' height""<p>Your violating encapsulation of the object's attributes by ""caching"" this data elsewhere.  If you need to do such things, this is what MVC was invented to handle: an attribute changes, it fires an event and dependents refresh themselves, caches invalidate, etc.<p>3 - ""The Square class could have been written much later than her code""<p>Its still a Square (by my definition).  The new Squares she has are still Rectangles too.  Why did this programmer assume that changing a rectangle's length would never effect its width?  This invalid assumption could have been made prior or after the introduction of Squares.<p>In short, the original argument is bad because almost everyone agrees about the behavior of a Square.  Key to use of any code is agreement on how it works.  For example, If I use jQuery and can't wrap my mind on how John Resig thinks I should be using his library, its my problem.",1252963434

He seems to have a good mix of interests in technology, entrepreneurship, marketing, and politics.<p>If I was in the market for a VC (or an investor, as he is until he gets Lowercase off the ground), he would be up there with some other investors with more years of experience, because he's been learning at a very quick pace and in a way that gives him perspective--by speaking, meeting founders, and making small investments.",1252962797

Map would have to apply the predicate to every element of the list before any/all kicked in.<p>Just use the lazy map itertools.imap (or Python 3, where `map` is lazy) or replace listcomps by gencomps, any & all take any iterable if you're worried about that. Stop creating problems where there is none.",1252962749

822628,comment,821827,821827,0,0,DannoHung,,,"I would like to mock propose the following idea: A Debugger License.  Like a driver's license, you have to have a certain amount of experience and qualification to operate a debugger.  Improper use of your debugger may incur fines and penalties up to the revocation of your license.<p>Licensing should involve operational demonstration of design capacity, testing, and reasoning.  After passing the initial phase of licensing, you may operate the debugger under supervision to learn the full spectrum of debugger capabilities (no point using a tool poorly, after all).\n[/tongue:cheek]<p>I don't really blame people for using debuggers badly though.  They're one of the few practical coding tools that time is actually spent on in university classes.  In my experience, we were expected to use them to understand the operation of the stack frame and heap in decoding a program especially built around having funny tricks.  To throw back to my analogy, it's a bit like teaching a new driver how to do a powerslide before teaching them to obey stop signs.",1252962656

822626,comment,822354,822354,0,0,akeefer,,,"Beyond just the obvious ""this is a bad way to design things"" message, another good takeaway is just the fact that most OO-design tutorials/discussions/books use the worst possible examples that teach people bad habits.<p>When done well, the useful part of OO design is encapsulation and data-hiding, not inheritance, but everyone gets hung up on inheritance because it's easy to cobble together ""is-a"" examples from real-world-like things, which just trains people to abuse the model.<p>In the real world outside OO-design books and freshman CS classes people don't have separate classes for different shapes, they just have ""Polygon"" or whatever the graphics buffer requires.  And no one has separate subtypes of ""AbstractVehicle"" for ""PassengerCar"" and ""Motorcycle"" and ""CommercialTruck,"" they just have a ""Vehicle"" class with a bunch of data on it and rely on the client code knowing what to do with that data.",1252962485

I&#x27;m actually a big fan of Thiel and see the positive sides of the theory as well.  To someone not from our tech startup world though, I wanted to be clear about the politics of the people behind the service, and the possible implications. Facebook is a business, and it likely has a political agenda behind it.<p>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re a nice person.  I also honestly think that Facebook, the NSA, Al Jazeera and even Cheezburger are full of nice people who want to make the world a better place.

8980889,comment,8979662,8980776,0,0,lostcolony,,,"We&#x27;re moving into an area whose terminology I&#x27;m not as familiar with as the underlying concepts, but what I recall, yes, the actual big-o of a -single- operation, if this is implemented strictly and used as a single ended queue, has a worst case bound of O(n), and a best case bound of O(1), and an average case of O(1), and would be described in big-O terms as &quot;amortized O(1), worst case of O(n)&quot;; much like an arraylist (where the general case for adding at the end is O(1), but when it&#x27;s full, is actually O(n) as we create a new array and copy elements over, but we describe it as having an amortized cost of O(1)).<p>Or put another way, for n enqueues, rather than thinking of each enqueue taking one operation, think of it taking two, one now, one deferred, for a still constant enqueue time. On a dequeue where the right side is empty, you have n deferred operations &#x27;stored up&#x27;, that you then use to reverse the list, and then you use one operation to take the head. So while that -particular- operation actually uses up n+1 operations, the amortized time across the entire sequence of operations so far is constant. And so while you may not have real time dequeue performance of a single operation if implemented strictly (that is, in the worst case, where the right list is empty), the act of enqueueing n things, and dequeueing n things, leads to a total time proportional to n, leading to an averaged constant time per operation.<p>Now, that said, if you treat it as a double ended queue, there is a worst case in the strict implementation that runs in O(n) per operation; that&#x27;s by inserting onto one end, then alternately pulling off one end, then the other (so that for every dequeue, we have to reverse the remaining list again). But that&#x27;s extremely degenerate, and is more egregious than describing quicksort as O(n^2) due to its degenerate case of an already sorted list (since that&#x27;s far more common a use case than inserting always on one end, and perfectly alternating your dequeues).",1422813427

8980885,comment,8980225,8980225,0,0,Yizahi,,,"Vast majority of humans can&#x27;t comprehend how to rate any thing on more than good/bad scale. Even less people understand how you could rate some thing on 1-5 scale where whole range is in &quot;good&quot; category, so 1 is a somewhat good mark.\nOne of the most obvious examples are schools. In my country before reform we had 1-5 marks. 1 and 2 were not considered valid mark but rather an absence of any score. So instead of five scale we had three scale. And since 3 was a placeholder for &quot;passable&quot; actual marks showing quality of the work were 4 and 5. And of course in time were invented unofficial corrections + and -, then ++ and -- etc.<p>So when adults with 20-30 years of supposed experience of grading quality of work can&#x27;t use even a simple 1-5 system then it is obvious that general population will fail at grading even more spectacularly.

These were likely amounts small enough, given the parameters of the debt-cancellation rules, that recovery was never a particularly practical option anyway. If the debt on the books of utilities or a bank is not good enough to sell to a third party and is not considered recovery internally then the accountants would be quite happy to simply have these amounts off the books and the corporations and governments probably reap more rewards in positive PR than the debts were worth.<p>The perhaps larger problem that I think is being solved here, besides the debt itself, is the bank account &quot;blocking&quot;[1] that appears to be a provision in current law that the government is not interested in changing. Once someone&#x27;s bank accounts are blocked I presume that they are forced into the cash economy and that is bad for the government in lost taxes as well as citizens with respect to many things, including good old fashioned &quot;getting ripped off&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.croatiaweek.com/over-300000-accounts-blocked-due-to-debt-from-bills/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.croatiaweek.com/over-300000-accounts-blocked-due-...</a>",1422813196

We&#x27;ve been growing our service at an exponential rate for the past year, and our customers love us! We have a number of open positions, and have hired a significant portion of our team via Hacker News.<p>FOUR positions:<p><pre><code>  1) Software Engineer\n  2) Special Operations Associate\n  3) Customer Service Specialist\n  4) Business Development Manager\n</code></pre>\nRinse is hiring Software Engineers to develop our functionality across the stack. We have hybrid mobile apps for both Android and iOS for our customers AND our drivers. We also have sophisticated web-based tools for our customer service team, internal operations staff, and vendors. Laundry is a surprisingly-complex logistical process, and so our customer-facing software is just the tip of the iceberg. We&#x27;re solving problems like the Traveling Salesman and image classification, too. Our tech stack is approximately HTML5 / Backbone.js / Django / Python / Postgres / Heroku / Ubuntu, but we&#x27;re a tiny tech team, so any newcomer will be able to shape architecture.<p>We&#x27;re also hiring for a &quot;Special Operations Associate&quot; which is someone who may not have unique technical ability, but who has great aptitude and a willingness to work hard to improve our business. Analytical capability and attention to detail are important skills for this person. Bonus points for someone with an Industrial Engineering or Process Engineering background. This position is great for an ambitious analytical mind looking to join a &quot;rocket ship&quot; startup. Obviously, this position presents a significant growth opportunity.<p>Rinse has excellent customer service, and we&#x27;d like to continue improving it with a Customer Service Specialist.  This individual will lead a team of customer service associates, while enjoying close support from our technology and operations teams.  The ideal candidate will have managed customer service in a consumer-focused startup environment.<p>Finally, Rinse is looking for a Business Development Manager to &quot;hustle&quot; and cement new business relationships as we grow.  If you like going out and meeting small business owners, this is your gig!<p>Any applicant who we interview will receive $25 in free Rinse credit... If you live in San Francisco, give us a try!<p>Interested? I&#x27;d be happy to answer any questions at sam (at) rinse.com.",1422812919

It&#x27;s just as much the fault of the creditor to give the (maybe unpayable?) loan, as it is for the debtor to take/agree to it.<p>On the one hand, the debtor pretty much ends up stealing. And on the other hand, the creditor took a too-risky loan without <i>considering</i> the repayment ability of the person he was giving it to. We&#x27;re conditioned to think this as some sort of cruel injustice (and it is indeed a sad situation), while completely ignoring the actions of the debtor.<p>You could go one step further and say that perhaps the debtor was committing fraud by tricking the creditor into giving out the loan when he knew the chance of repayment was low. (Assuming debt-slavery wasn&#x27;t the goal of the creditor in the first place). Also exclude accidents and life-altering events (corner case). I&#x27;d imagine that after a few of these horrible incidents came to light in a <i>connected</i> world (i.e. modern times, not centuries past) creditors would start adding clauses into their contracts about possible re-payment plans/options, etc. Hell, they might not even offer to give the loans out if they were too risky.<p>If there is one thing I&#x27;d like individuals to take from this comment, it&#x27;s that laws and regulations aren&#x27;t the only solution to society&#x27;s problems.

We believe that containers will lead to much more software being built at greater speed and scale than ever before, so much so that many existing approaches will need to be reimagined.<p>We have an experienced team and welcome newcomers who want to progress fast, as well as domain experts in relevant technologies. Currently Weave is a set of network services written in Go, packaged to make distributed Docker applications much easier to construct. But we have considerable ambitions, and the space is evolving rapidly, so we especially seek developers with the right outlook and ability to adapt.<p>Ideally you have real world experience of building and running systems with a focus on resilience and uptime. You are as comfortable designing or debugging a distributed protocol as you are talking to customers building a web app or scaling a data service.<p>We hope to meet developers who share our values:<p>- Complete focus on the simplest possible user experience<p>- A real desire to innovate, and then measure success by happy customers not kudos from purists<p>- Relish being held accountable for work quality, but want to own how that work is done<p>- Want to participate in shaping the culture and technology of a fast moving company<p>- We communicate clearly and we respect everyone who uses our software<p>In short, you would be working on a highly visible and ambitious open source project with all the opportunities and responsibilities that come with that.

8980804,comment,8980292,8980292,0,0,graycat,,,"Project planning and estimating is a big\nfield.<p>In a nutshell, the key to making such an\neffort very effective is just really good\nknowledge of and experience with all the\nparts of the project to be done.<p>Below in (1) -- (5) I give an overview of\nparts of the field.<p>(1) Importance of Experience.<p>Here some examples where a lot of\nexperience is crucial:<p>A kitchen/bath remodeling firm can give a\ngood estimate of time and cost because\nthey have already done, say, one such job\na week for five years, that is, 250 jobs;\nso, essentially they have already <i>seen it\nall</i>, that is, all the possibilities of\nwhat can go wrong and how much there is to\ndo.  Similarly for an auto body shop, a\nresidential HVAC company, a plumber or\nelectrician, a landscaping company, an\nasphalt paving company, a residential\nhousing general contractor, etc.<p>(2) Software Projects and Experience.<p>One means of project planning and\nestimating for software projects looks at\neach of the parts of the work and starts\nwith the experience level of the team for\nthat part.<p>For parts of the work where the team has\nno experience, that is, is doing such work\nfor the first time, no estimates are made!<p>So, the project planning works only for\nprojects where there is good experience\nfor all the parts of the work.<p>Alas, often software projects need to do\nsome things for the first time.<p>(3) Critical Path.<p>Some US DoD projects made use of Gantt\ncharts,<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CDUQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FGantt_chart&ei=VVPOVL2RBsKvggTTmoLQAQ&usg=AFQjCNGPgpcTN31kjmjYV37AeWRWfKguxg&bvm=bv.85076809,d.eXY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd...</a><p>and in particular the concept of a\n<i>critical path</i>.  As I recall, this work\ncan make good use of linear programming\nwhich can identify the critical path.<p>Intuitively the <i>critical path</i> is a\nsequence of tasks such that, if any task\nin that sequence takes one minute longer,\nthen the whole project will take one\nminute longer.  So, the tasks on the\ncritical path have no <i>slack</i>.<p>So, to speed up the whole project, must at\nleast speed up the projects on the\ncritical path.<p>Next, then, of course, is the issue of\nwhere to put more resources to speed up\nthe projects on the critical path.  This,\nthen, is a <i>resource allocation</i> problem,\nanother optimization problem.<p>(4) Alternatives and Uncertainty.<p>One of the biggest problems in getting\nprojects done on time and within budget is\nhandling uncertainty, e.g., the effects of\nunpredictable, outside influences, that\nit, <i>exogenous random inputs</i>.<p>And, there can be some alternatives in how\nto execute the projects; then during the\nproject might select different\nalternatives depending on how the project\nhas gone so far, that is, the then current\n<i>state</i> of the project.<p><i>State</i> -- Essentially the situation or\nstatus of the project at some particular\ntime, and generally want enough\n<i>information</i> in the state (<i>vector</i> or\ncollection of information) such that the\npast and the future of the project are\nconditionally independent given the state,\nthat is, want to satisfy the Markov\nassumption so that in planning the future\ncan use just the current state and f&#x27;get\nabout all the rest of the past.<p>One such <i>state</i> is always the full past\n<i>history</i> of the project, but commonly\nmuch less <i>information</i> is also sufficient\nto serve as the state.<p>Commonly we can be drawn into the applied\nmathematics of stochastic optimal control,\nsay, at least discrete time stochastic\ndynamic programming, e.g.,<p>Stuart E. Dreyfus and Averill M. Law, &#x27;The\nArt and Theory of Dynamic Programming&#x27;,\nISBN 0-12-221860-4, Academic Press.<p>Dimitri P. Bertsekas and Steven E. Shreve,\n&#x27;Stochastic Optimal Control:  The Discrete\nTime Case&#x27;, ISBN 0-12-093260-1, Academic\nPress.<p>Wendell H. Fleming and Raymond W. Rishel,\n&#x27;Deterministic and Stochastic Optimal\nControl&#x27;, ISBN 0-387-90155-8,\nSpringer-Verlag, Berlin, 1979.<p>E. B. Dynkin and A. A. Yushkevich,\n&#x27;Controlled Markov Processes&#x27;, ISBN\n0-387-90387-9, Springer-Verlag, Berlin.<p>So, a lot of quite serious applied math\nresearch has been done, and a lot is\nknown.<p>Broadly stochastic dynamic programming\nmakes the best decisions that can be made\nmaking use of only information available\nat the time each decision is to be made.<p>Nicely enough from the Markov assumption\nand just a simple application of Fubini&#x27;s\ntheorem, we can say a little more about\nbeing <i>best possible</i>.<p>Interesting here, and a way to get some\nmassive speedups of some software, is the\nconcept of <i>certainty equivalence</i> in the\ncase of LQG, that is, <i>linear, quadratic,\nGaussian</i> control as in<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-quadratic-Gaussian_control"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-quadratic-Gaussian_contr...</a><p>So, the <i>system</i> is linear (as in a linear\noperator or, for an important special\ncase, matrix multiplication); the\nexogenous random variables are Gaussian;\nand the quantity to be <i>controlled</i>, say,\nminimized, is quadratic (which also\nincludes linear).<p>(5) Spreadsheets.<p>Sometimes a spreadsheet is used for\nproject planning, and there is an\ninteresting observation to be made here:<p>So, suppose we are doing financial\nplanning for five years and develop a\nspreadsheet with one column for each\nmonth, that is, 60 columns, maybe 61,\nand one row for each <i>variable</i>.<p>So, some of the spreadsheet cells\nrepresent exogenous random variables, and\nsome cells represent decisions to be made.<p>(A) We can fix the decisions and\n<i>recalculate</i> the spreadsheet, say, 500\ntimes and, thus, do Monte Carlo simulation\nfor the random cells and get an empirical\ndistribution and expected value of the\nmoney made at the end of the project.<p>(B) We can fix the values of the exogenous\nrandom variables and then use some\noptimization to find the values of the\ndecisions that maximize the money made at\nthe end of the project.  Spreadsheet\nsoftware has long, often had some\noptimization, from linear programming or\nL. Lasdon&#x27;s generalized reduced gradient\nsoftware, version 2 -- GRG2.<p>This approach, in terms of football, say,\nthe Superbowl later today, would be like\nthe quarterback on first and ten calling\nthe next four plays without considering\nthe extra information he will have after\neach of the plays.  Quarterbacks wouldn&#x27;t\ndo that, and business planners should not\neither.<p>(C) But what about making the best\ndecisions with the random exogenous random\nvariables not fixed?  Then usually we want\nto maximize the expected value of the\nmoney made at the end, but the form of the\ndecisions is special:  At each period, the\ndecisions are in terms of the <i>state</i> of\nthe project as of the end of the last\nperiod.<p>So, such optimization is called discrete\ntime stochastic dynamic programming,\nMarkov decision theory, etc.<p>So, nicely enough, computer spreadsheet\nsoftware has enabled some millions of\nplanners to specify in very precise terms\nsome nearly complete formulations of\nproblems to be solved with stochastic\ndynamic programming.<p>For a reasonably large spreadsheet, such\noptimization would be a super computer\napplication -- nicely, there really is a\nlot of parallelism that can be exploited.<p>At one time I pursued just this direction\nat the IBM Watson lab in Yorktown Heights.\nHad the semi-far sighted management let me\ncontinue, by now there should be a good\nbusiness for cloud sites to do such\nproblems, say, use a few thousand cores.\nAh, IBM has missed out on several much\nlarger opportunities!<p>There are various approaches to making the\ncomputations faster, say, using\nmultivariate splines to approximate some\nof the functions (tables) to be generated,\nthe R. Rockafellar idea of <i>scenario\naggregation</i>, and more.<p>My guess is that the OP has in mind\nsomething simpler.<p>As I recall, there is some project\nplanning software.  Right, a simple Google\nsearch shows, e.g., Microsoft&#x27;s Project\n2013.",1422812216

It may be accurate for <i>some</i> VCs but definitely not for all of them or even enough of them to state this with such confidence and as though it is the rule rather than the exception.<p>Depending on the VC you could be looking at former technology entrepreneurs that have sold their business(es) and are re-investing the proceeds, collectives of those, VCs run by financially savvy accountants or similar that work on behalf of a usually much larger number of LPs and so on. In fact the number of VCs that have institutional partners such as teachers unions is probably relatively low because of the fact that the &#x27;risk profile&#x27; of VC is higher than what those institutional investors can stomach, though if a VC were able to raise capital from such a source they&#x27;d definitely go for it.<p>So that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t happen but it&#x27;s not the structural motor behind the SV capital engine, just like your average pension fund isn&#x27;t going to go to the casino with their holdings, it would be against their fiduciary duty to do so, and quite a few pension funds are already in trouble with their more risk averse investments done in the past.

There is always a risk that you won&#x27;t get anything for the money you&#x27;ve invested and you are expected to consider these risks. That&#x27;s also part of the reasons that professional lenders expect a certain rate of interest (another part of the interest rate is obviously for the fact that the lender could do something else with his money if he didn&#x27;t lend it). If you have a higher risk, you pay more. So, if you fault multiple times you won&#x27;t find anyone who will give you money anymore in the future or they will want more interest or they will want some securities .. and so on.

Since 2011, we’ve been nose-down building a scalable platform that provides brands and retailers the ability to engage, reward and incent their consumers directly and across any channel – online, mobile and in-store. We pioneered the concept of card-linked-offers and have taken it to the next level – always-on loyalty. Both our self-service and SaaS-based platforms enable the creation of actionable ads, coupons, offers, promotions, rebates and more that let you reward loyalty... not just discount a purchase. This is the future of Loyalty.<p>* Technology Stack<p>Core Stack : { Java, Spring, Sharded mySql, Terracotta, RabbitMQ }<p>Mobile : { iOS, Android }<p>* Additional Info<p>We&#x27;re wired into the three largest card networks: Visa, Mastercard and Amex.  We have a broad range of customers from grocery giant SuperValu where we&#x27;re deployed with a first of its kind card-linked SKU offer solution to FanBank where we help enable community based Loyalty programs.<p>We run an agile shop with 70 successful sprints under our belts.  Our process has been improved over the 4 years we&#x27;ve been running it so that we deliver on time and without drama.  Our engineers don&#x27;t sit in meetings they build solutions.<p>We&#x27;re looking for solid Java engineers to join our team and help us build out the next level of capabilities on our platform.<p>If this sounds interesting, please shoot me an email at coolgigs@linkablenetworks.com",1422811781

I estimate it will take me about 20 years to afford the house, so I start putting away money from my pay check.<p>However, since I don&#x27;t have a mortgage and thus no house to live in, I also have to pay rent somewhere. This means I am paying 1/20 the cost of a house + the cost of rent in my city.<p>Additionally, since I won&#x27;t be buying a house for 20 years, there&#x27;s a risk that the value of housing could change drastically in that time period, meaning the amount I&#x27;ve saved might not amount to enough to cover the price of housing when I&#x27;m finally ready to buy. Obviously the risk of this happening varies by how I invest my savings, and the particularities of the housing market I live in.<p>So the benefit to saving vs. borrowing comes down to something like:<p>(Cost of Housing in 20Years) + (Cost of Rent for 20 Years) - (Gains from Investments) \nvs. \n(Cost of Housing Today) + (Interest on Mortgage for 20 years)<p>Obviously there&#x27;s a lot of other things to take into account, but it&#x27;s not as simple as Savings Good Debt Bad.",1422811620

Propagating the estimate for a subtask to other subtasks at the same level makes a lot of sense for a first guess, if I&#x27;m any good at task breakdown.  The propagating <i>up</i> to the &quot;aunt/uncle&quot; tasks (i.e. siblings of the parent) is a bit stranger - seems like it should dramatically underestimate most top-level tasks, and I&#x27;d worry about the anchoring effect.  Still, it makes it very convenient and quick.<p>Have you thought about visually distinguishing autoguessed estimates from manually entered ones?  At least for leaf tasks, I&#x27;d like a reminder of what I have left to estimate.  (You could propagate up the &quot;degree of guessedness&quot; to parent nodes, but you probably wouldn&#x27;t want to, or it would undermine the usefulness of guessing in the first place.)<p>* The visual tree structure is nice.  I like how the horizontal arrangement puts a natural limit on how deeply you can nest, and therefore discourages overplanning :)",1422810982

Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t even affect the amount of initial coding hours, it is just one of the freebie gains that comes with experience.<p>[1] Many more such bugs would probably occur if the company didn&#x27;t occasionally get around to load-testing, so that should be part of CI or dev cycle if possible.",1422810951

My understanding is that those are in-place updates from the filesystem&#x27;s POV, so writing over 32k of old pages will cause 128-256k actual writes. One could avoid this somewhat with trim support, fallocate + hole punch (not portable) but you have to think carefully about alignments and grouping free pages into contiguous erase block multiples.

We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. We just went to Portugal...where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=""http://we.are.expensify.com/apply"" rel=""nofollow"">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>).<p>We are excited to hear from you!",1422810469

1178085,comment,1173714,1177485,0,0,elblanco,,,"You do make an important point. I was simply attempting to counter one anecdote with another. But I think the argument of ""the pedals are too close so people are probably just hitting the wrong one"", while an interesting thought exercise, digresses from the actual problems:<p>1) The cars made by Toyota, on occasion, even when under the control of an experienced driver, with years of experience with not only that make/model of vehicle, but even with that exact vehicle, operate in a way which is out of expected operating parameters. This happens with cars from other makers, but #2 and #3 clarify this. <a href=""http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gc_pIFqke7WxQovY3MnhcyIYiLgwD9EB15EO0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gc_pIFqke7...</a><p>2) Toyota has known, very clearly about this problem for quite a while and has refused to address it. As far as the public knows, Toyota has done no engineering exercise to discover the nature of the flaw and has so far engaged in finger pointing. When Steve Wozniak found another, similar flaw in the brake system after doing a fairly extensive engineering review of his car, he was initially ignored, then met with surprise at such a wild discovery.<p>3) Similar problems have been found in other cars, even ones with a strong reputation for quality and reliability. Those makers responded almost immediately and took it seriously. The cat is out of the bag that Toyota was not taking it seriously, or rather that Toyota was calculating public safety vs. the cost of lawsuits. This speaks to a particularly broken internal corporate climate. Which is surprising to anyone who has studied Toyota's corporate management philosophy.<p>While two data point (mine and my father's) are rightly taken as anecdotal data, there are not, in any real sense that many more reported cases of car crashes -- yet we're all taking it very seriously. When does a collection of events become ""statistical data""? My stats prof in uni said that statistics are simply a large collection of anecdotes. The number of people with reported unexpected acceleration problems is actually very small. What's the line that separates anecdotes from ""vanishingly small percentage""?<p>I'd argue that the definition of this line is precisely the mental exercise that Toyota found itself caught up in when it was trying to decide to recall or wait for the law suits. In the end, the company erred on the side of ignoring statistically insignificant anecdotes to their peril.",1268139229

1178049,comment,1177342,1177511,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"I kind of hate this attitude. When you say ""there's always work to be done"", I take that to mean that you think the employees should always be working.<p>I think that if you're doing it right, you don't have to worry about the literal amount of time an employee is ""working"" or ""not working"". If you are treating your employees right, they will reciprocate, and they will be interested in making a great product, really interested. They will contribute in unexpected ways, and they will take care to perform outstandingly on a consistent basis because of the way you perform for them. You just have to be willing to give up that classical ""I own your eight hours mwahaha"" viewpoint.<p>Inspiration can't be scheduled; maybe if you would let your employees go home and play some video games, something in the game would trigger an idea that would result in huge wins for your company. Inspiration almost never arises in the face of intimidation, though. (Not good inspiration, anyway; maybe inspiration about how to sabotage, how to collect paycheck while manifesting passive-aggressive resentment and crossing fingers that the boss ultimately falls on his face and loses everything.)<p>You have to be reasonable about your expectations. People need to live balanced lives. You don't want workaholic employees, you want employees who lead healthy, good, balanced lives. Encouraging emotional starvation may look good on paper but it almost always results in lurking, pernicious, rarely-perceived-until-it's-too-late crumblings elsewhere.<p>There is always work to be done, on almost anything. Give your employees some trust and freedom, and as long as you're hiring mature professionals, you'll get much, much more than your initial investment back. It may not always manifest as extra time-in-chair, but it's always worth it. How can it not be? You let your employees live their lives, you empowered them to both live well and remain in control. That's always worth it.",1268137194

The VPN is much slower and using the web version if Outlook blows given the volume of email I deal with.

I don't think there are many of us fooling ourselves about the worthiness of that kind of investment; there's just not enough money in Linux gaming to hold up a release on Mac/Win for Linux issues.<p>The guy said OpenGL-based games might be good for Linux, which is indeed true; it's much easier to go from an OpenGL Mac game to an OpenGL Linux game than it is to go from DX Windows to OpenGL Linux.<p>Games on Mac are good news for Linux because if the game is made sanely, it shouldn't be much work to get it to at least compile on Linux, as both systems are more or less POSIX compatible. This is good! Even if there are problems with the Linux build after a successful compilation, we're still much further ahead than we are with a DirectX Windows game as the target.<p>Furthermore, making the OpenGL renderers available under Windows may greatly improve the experience in WINE, especially for non-flagship games. Again, there's no guarantee that this renderer will be exposed in Windows, but even if not, there's at least a tangible possibility that it might happen sometime.<p>The bottom line is that the investment required to port a Mac game to Linux is almost always going to be much less than the investment required to port a [DirectX] Windows game to Linux. Therefore, previously Windows-only games coming to Mac is great news because at the very least it makes the possibility of a Linux release that much closer.",1268136216

I go to the office 3-4 days a week (and work 7-8 hours there each day), and work from home 1-2 days (I've done stretches of several weeks out of the office because of extenuating circumstances, however).  When working from home, I start early, work a few hours before my kids wake up, spend an hour or so with them, then go to our home office for the remainder of the work day.  Those early hours are the most productive by far.<p>Communication is key.  Of course, my team is split between two offices, one in PA and the other in California, so we're used to communicating on the phone or via Skype.  My desk phone is also forwarded on days I work from home, so if I'm keeping early hours, a team member can get in touch with me if necessary.  In three years, however, I've never been called after 5:00 PM.",1268136058

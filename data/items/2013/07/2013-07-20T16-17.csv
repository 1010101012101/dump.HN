He may be in his circumstances, but having worked with two dozen Nests, my experience says this helps almost everyone.<p>I own nine Nests in two properties, a loft office with one zone and a two building home with eight zones. The loft is commercial central heat and air.  The home is boiler heat with eight baseboard zones.<p>The Nest in loft saved me about 30% compared to prior years, and the Nests in home saved me closer to 50%.<p>The reason I saved so much in the home is thanks to the energy history view in the web or iPad app.  I was able to see which zones were cycling on and off when, and adjust relative zone temps until all zones were sharing work equally.  When all zones were naively the same temp, some zones were always on (lower floors) while others were never on (top floor). Balancing temps differently until I could see all zones cycling equivalently dropped my boiler burn time by 50%.<p>Based on this, I recommended these to a number of friends and family.  Those with conventional central heat and air have all commented on savings they can see on their electric bill.<p>The one exception is a friend with commercial office properties. He switched to Nest and was having trouble, bill shot up!  Turned out his tenants were mis-training the Nest, with the classic misunderstanding that turning it higher than our goal makes it adjust temps up faster.  Nest was letting temps drop farther, then tenants would turn it to 85 thinking that would make it heat faster. It learned that, and was hitting 85 every morning then tenants trained to let it drop back to 75 during day. We tweaked the Away temps to stay closer to normal, switched off learning, and set a nice schedule.  Now he&#x27;s saving 30% or so as well.",1374338975

6075681,comment,6074964,6075276,1,0,coopdog,,,"From the security FAQ:
&quot;Plug uses asymmetric cryptography. When Plug is installed, the application generates a RSA-2048 pair of keys, identifiable by the user&#x27;s email, and with a private key protected by the user password. This private key, which is what authenticates a user in the Plug system, is stored in your Plug and your devices. We don&#x27;t know this key because we don&#x27;t have your password, so we cannot - us or anyone else - steal your identity.&quot;<p>So it really does seem to be zero knowledge, and therefore could be the magic UI that finally makes proper asymmetric encryption tolerable to the general public.<p>The NSA could still steal the key off of any of the devices, but it would be hard to do that systematically on a global scale. The closed source nature of this software probably still makes it a no-go though, they can just coerce them to patch it ala skype.<p>I wonder how this would fair against TSA also. If your entire home server looks like a folder, and they can copy that folder at the border, they now get every file you care about rather than just the ones on any one device.",1374338770

I&#x27;d much, much prefer to see a single payer system.<p>Seeing every specialist is different than being in treatment with a doctor and having them cut you off because you can&#x27;t pay. It&#x27;s very rare I hear of a doctor going &quot;well it&#x27;s a shame you can&#x27;t afford to pay for this surgery&quot; - nearly always they do it, bill it, and accept the losses.

6075651,comment,6073015,6075440,5,0,Silhouette,,,"FWIW, I don&#x27;t think righteousness is really the issue here. All consultancy is ultimately based on selling valuable information and/or judgement that the client doesn&#x27;t have but the consultant does, so in a sense it&#x27;s always based on the consultant charging money because of the client&#x27;s ignorance. It&#x27;s hard to find any objective standard for reasonable pricing other than &quot;what the market is willing to pay&quot;.<p>Maybe it becomes more ethically dubious when the consultant is taking advantage not of the client&#x27;s ignorance in the field where they&#x27;re paying for advice but of their ignorance of the consulting market itself in that field. Even then, it&#x27;s the natural position that a new customer doesn&#x27;t know the sellers&#x27; market, and a large chunk of sales and marketing is based on trying to convince uncertain prospective customers to buy from you and not someone else, so again it&#x27;s hard to find any objective standard for what is fair and what is unfairly taking advantage. (This is a major argument for licensing practitioners in industries where bad advice can be particularly damaging, such as healthcare, law and accountancy.)<p>One thing that is very clear is that the value-based pricing approach only works if you can find some credible and quantifiable means to demonstrate the value you might offer to a client. If you work in a field like conversion optimisation, that&#x27;s easy enough. If you (or your consultancy including colleagues/subs) are building an entire system that will have concrete benefits for the business, you can probably do it too. If you build software in general, maybe as part of a wider team or making incremental functional changes to an existing system as many freelancers/contractors do, then it&#x27;s not the same situation.<p>This is why it sometimes irritates me when a handful of HN celebrities post repeatedly about raising rates and changing the basis for charging as if everyone can do it, even in response to someone who would obviously have to fundamentally change the kind of work they do before the advice would make sense for them. It sets false expectations, and potentially damages the careers of people who go out to customers/clients with unrealistic expectations and wind up missing out on reasonably profitable work. Worse, it could tarnish their reputation and leave unhappy clients behind, because even though they did what they said they&#x27;d do, the client later discovered they&#x27;d paid well over the odds and felt ripped off. It&#x27;s never happened to me, because I choose not to work that way, but I&#x27;ve seen it happen to others and the results are never pretty.",1374338180

A number of sites won&#x27;t even send you anything via email except &quot;please log in&quot; anyway. For example, when my bank sends me a &quot;bank statement&quot; by email, all it contains is a notification that there is a new bank statement waiting online, if I want to log in and read it.

Insurance doesn&#x27;t make everything affordable, but it probably wild have been helpful. Though maybe the co-pay would have been $50k.<p>Universal tax-payer funded insurance? The term &quot;tax payer&quot; is interesting because politicians and pundits forget that we&#x27;re all tax payers in one form or another. Granted some pay more, some are net consumers of govt services. But tax payers mean us, and those with more earned income more than those with less. I think the main difference between taxes and donation is choice.<p>Single-payer or government provided healthcare? Pretty sure that no one would identify the government as the picture perfect example of efficiency. Plus, putting elected officials or their appointees in charge of handing out goods and services doesnt seem to be sustainable.

This assumes that the thought put into many site designs is  driven by metrics like conversion rates, etc. I suspect that this may only be true for 1 in 10 of the designs we see, and that the other 9 are actually just following what everyone else is doing. That&#x27;s not to say that following what others is doing has no value, but that what is valued in the design is not improving things like conversion rates, but rather in making the site appear young and hip, etc.<p>So, still a market effect overall, just not usually for the reasons the author suggests.",1374336255

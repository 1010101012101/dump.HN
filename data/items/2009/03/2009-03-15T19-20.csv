Subject: Re: qualtiative study<p>Sorry Kim, but it just aint so. Voluntary response data are <i>worthless</i>. One excellent example is the books by Shere Hite. She collected many responses from biased lists with voluntary response and drew conclusions that are roundly contradicted by all responsible studies. She claimed to be doing only qualitative work, but what she got was just plain garbage. Another famous example is the Literary Digest ""poll"". All you learn from voluntary response is what is said by those who choose to respond. Unless the respondents are a substantially large fraction of the population, they are very likely to be a biased -- possibly a very biased -- subset. Anecdotes tell you nothing at all about the state of the world. They can't be ""used only as a description"" because they describe nothing but themselves.[/quote]<p><a href=""http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=194473&tstart=36420"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=194473&tsta...</a><p>For more on the distinction between statistics and mathematics, see<p><a href=""http://statland.org/MAAFIXED.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://statland.org/MAAFIXED.PDF</a><p>and<p><a href=""http://repositories.cdlib.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=uclastat/cts/tise"" rel=""nofollow"">http://repositories.cdlib.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=10...</a>",1237145458

Nutritionist and serious athletes and athletic trainers will tell you differently.<p>Here are some factors:<p>- Several studies have used no vitamins at all! (only surveys about ""Do you take a vitamin?"") They don't take account the frequency/consistency, quality, etc.<p>- Vitamin studies often focus on single vitamins in isolation. Nutrition doesn't work like that.  You need the full range.<p>- Most studies involve really low end or even average vitamins, and I'm specifically suggesting very high end vitamins.<p>- There are plenty of studies that show the real benefits of high quality supplementation. LEF has cataloged and published many of these. So have countless others.<p>Nearly all vitamins sold in pharmacies, Walmart, etc. are poor quality.  A Center for Nutritional Education study found that many low end child's vitamins are no healthier than candy.<p>You can always tell by reading the label.  If B12 is packaged as ""cyanocobalamin"" it's an inferior vitamin.  Look for B12 as hydrocobalamin instead (but you'll probably have to go to a health food store to find it.)<p>One time I saw a display of vitamins advertising heart-healthy Omega oils, however the vitamins also included hydrogenated oils (which promote heart disease.)<p>So, I don't doubt that average vitamins fewer benefits.<p>There's also the issue that too many people expect vitamins alone will solve their health problems, and disregard other important factors like having healthier meals, exercise, sufficient water and sunlight.

Probably the single worst decision for Java was that the programmer needed to be protected from his own stupidity.  What we ended up with is a language that's overly verbose and encourages baroque design patterns.<p>Bruce discusses some of the well known bad design decisions in Java, such as no operator overloading (.equals(), bah), bolt on generics, primitives instead of being purely object based.  And there are a ton of other design decisions that made for a bad language: explicit typing of functions instead of duck typing and specialization, introspection for methods but not variables, no first class methods, everything has to be in a class instead of everything is an object, etc.<p>In the end Java will fade away and the JVM will endure with newer and better languages.  The one thing that no one envisions is  a better Java unconstrained by past errors.  I suppose that's because of the rigid control by Sun.",1237143760

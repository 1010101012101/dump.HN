100569,comment,100497,100497,0,0,far33d,,,"It certainly seems a lot easier to get a huge valuation from Wall Street than from Sand Hill Road. A lot of these ""mega-valuations"" (zillow, ning, slide, etc) have gotten funding from PE, hedge, and investment houses instead of classic VC.",1200696914

100565,comment,100460,100526,0,0,run4yourlives,,,">You have almost completely re-think your UI when you are developing for a different device. Re-using CSS layouts is nearly impossible for that.<p>You don't re-use the CSS, you re-use the HTML. That's the point. All it needs is a new style sheet, not a whole new webapge.",1200696807

100560,comment,100460,100504,0,0,run4yourlives,,,">The answer being who gives a shit?<p>As a web developer, you should. It will save you work in the long run (see below).<p>As a hacker, you should, the same way you care about the beauty of readable code in any other language.<p>As a business owner, you should, because it will save you money, in bandwidth costs, future maintenance, training etc etc.<p>>Does it look fine in most browsers?<p>It looks fine in most browsers because the browser decided to make it look fine. That doesn't mean that it'll look fine in the browser everyone is using tomorrow. That means more work for you down the road, for no particular reason.<p>Do I care about it? No, not really. But I do get a little annoyed at hackers that concern themselves with code elegance in every language except HTML.",1200696550

It's quite obvious he either doesn't know about postgres, which means he didn't do any research for writing this article, or he does and he didn't mention it, which would mean he's trying to make his angle more legitimate than it really is.",1200696361

100555,comment,100460,100460,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"Most likely because PG or whomever else coded the site doesn't know how to use HTML with CSS, doesn't care to learn, and doesn't think it's important enough to learn.<p>People might down-mod me for that, but it's basically the truth.<p>Now, the only real benefits that Paul would probably consider CSS giving him would be the bandwidth usage (stylesheets are cached) and  maintenance issue.<p>I can't imagine either of those two would be enough to coerce him into learning a whole new way of doing things.<p>I certainly think that PG is missing many more benefits by not coding the site properly, but from his vantage point, (and everyone else who would see learning css as confusing and pointless) it's likely that the risk/reward assessment is not pointing in favour of a tableless layout.",1200695858

100553,comment,100460,100526,0,0,ericb,,,"I agree. CSS as a layout system is poorly thought out and even more poorly implemented. Why, to center an object, do I have to remember trivia like ""the parent needs a width."" You need hacks and non-intuitive tricks for cross-browser CSS. Tables are verbose, but they ""just work"" more often. I still use CSS layouts, but man what a steaming pile.",1200695809

There was an embargo against Serbia at the time, and the 1992 Fischer-Spassky chess match constituted a major commercial transaction (considering the press coverage and the $5 million prize money at stake). The State Department told Fischer about the consequences of playing the game well before it happened -- not only did he play the game anyway, he <i>spat</i> upon the letter from the State Department. IMHO he got pretty much what he deserved for that sort of behavior -- why not just play the match somewhere else, anyway?",1200694377

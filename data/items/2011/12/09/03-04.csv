Also ask for an executive account rep.\nOnce you have both of those, Godaddy actually calls you and your rep will request a pin number of you. Your names will only move if you give them permission to move.  Other registrars have this level of security too.  Hit me up if you want a referral to a good rep over there.",1323403107

3332472,comment,3298325,3298325,1,0,yourapostasy,,,"Looking over the 7 comments so far on this, I suggest you trust your instincts that this isn't a tremendously well-conceived business. Find someone else whose Rails skills you find are roughly comparable to yours, and say you are too booked to commit to sling the code for them, but you would be happy to serve in a technical advisory / oversight capacity as a board member, and here's this other Rails coder who should be able to serve your needs almost as well. Typical board member time commitment is no more than 16 hours a month for a director who is conscientious, with no chair commitments on a board, but one who preps for the board meetings, is available for ad-hoc and committee meetings, etc. Typical compensation is entirely equity, around 2% at the pre-seed stage for each director. Read up on what board of directors do in a startup if you take this advice and use it, before you approach them; don't go overboard, an evening spent Googling around is sufficient at your stage with these guys, you just need to get a feel for the boundary between guidance / advice and operations.<p>This delivers several objectives:<p>* Puts out the message: your professional time is outbidding their bid in the market.\n* Retain the relationship for a more manageable time commitment.\n* Allows them to get strategic-level technical advice from you ""for free"" (for now), and implement in the trenches as they see fit.\n* Gives them a starting point for another in the trenches implementer.<p>Expertise matters <i>a lot</i>. Execution matters more.<p>It can cost very little to offer general board-level guidance (making sure they are asking the right questions) using your expertise if like in your situation you are favorably disposed to the parties. It should cost very dear for you to use your expertise to execute.",1323403070

Madness.  How on earth is that considered fair, or a good thing for economic development?  Particularly when the states agreed to drop stamp duty in return for the GST incomes.<p>If you take it that demand for housing is pretty much unlimited (everyone wants their own dwelling, and everyone wants as much space as possible) then you must look at supply.<p>Sure, cities like Sydney are geographically constrained, but this doesn't explain the high cost of housing places where there are no geographic constraints, only planning constraints.<p>Historically, in Australia, the cost of the land was well below the cost of building a house on it.  Now it easily exceeds 50% of the cost in some cases.<p>The block of dirt under my feet cost 1500 pounds in the mid 1960's.  Converted to a modern value, that is about $30,000.  That value is out by a factor of probably 15-20 times.  Which means, in rough terms, the land is 20 times more valuable now than it was back then.  While some of this is attributable to improvement in services, population increase, etc etc, there isn't anywhere where you can buy a house block for $30,000 which is the inflation-adjusted price of the land as it was originally when the subdivision was opened.<p>The high value of land can only have one factor - restriction in supply.  Restriction of supply is caused by a combination of large land-holders drip-feeding blocks on to the market and in collusion with the state government putting major restrictions on the ability to release land for sale.",1323402137

3332343,comment,3327232,3328119,1,0,learc83,,,"> subtracting the cost of the driver isn't going to reduce the overall cost of such a trip significantly<p>I'll calculate the costs 10 passenger van, if you could work it out so that it gets an average of 40 mph for say 20 hours out of the day. That's about 300,000 miles per year divided by 20 miles per gallon that's 15,000 gallons of fuel. At $4 dollars per gallon thats $60,000 per year in fuel costs.<p>I'll assume another $60,000 per year in maintenance and depreciation (this is probably high b/c you can buy a new large passenger van for under $30,000)<p>We're at $110,000 in variable costs so far.<p>Now at $30,000 per year per driver in total costs (could be less, could be more depending on area)<p>Driver works 40 hours per week with sick time and vacation time. You'll need around 5 drivers in order to keep the van operational 24 hours per day.<p>That's $150,000--more than half of the total costs.<p>There are also other factors to consider. Drivers, don't want to operate that far from home, so you have to pay more.<p>You have to set up a logistical solution so that you can refresh the driver every 6-8 hours. That means depots where you can exchange them.<p>I'd say there would be <i>significant</i> cost savings.",1323400197

3332335,comment,3332193,3332327,1,0,saurik,,,"Interestingly, that is the reason I would go with PayPal over Stripe. Stripe's API is touted as ""awesome"", but I see no way to automatically reconcile chargebacks (the word ""chargeback"" isn't even present in their API documentation), and their ""webhooks"" feature is explicitly missing the critical functionality of ""retry if the server failed the response"" (making it totally useless to rely on: you are going to have to drop to polling to trust your data). I would thereby additionally be very curious to know what technical factors you found lacking with PayPal in relation to Stripe.",1323399966

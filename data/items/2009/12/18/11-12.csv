Anything else merely keeps a roof over your head while wasting your time, so it doesn't really matter what you settle for.",1261137441
1002981,comment,1002884,1002884,0,0,markessien,,,"I asked a reviewer on the phone once. He said this:<p>There are 3 levels of review (Technical, policies and X). Random reviewers test different aspects. There is also 'Escalation', which is when the reviewer is not sure and the internal policies are unclear.<p>Furthermore, he says that the policies in the review team change every week sometimes. Examples of policies:<p>- No women with things in their mouths are allowed<p>- If a butt is shown, a reasonable amount of torso has to be shown<p>- You cannot make fun of religion, you can only talk about religion in a neutral manner<p>So the reviewers have a long and complicated list of rules they are to follow, and this rule list is dynamically updated when an app comes in with new type of offensive stuff.",1261137372
1002980,comment,1000406,1002556,0,0,camccann,,,"Well, I never claimed to have a solution. I was just remarking that ""privatize it!"" is, alone, not a solution either (although a viable solution might very well <i>involve</i> privatization).<p>But yes, the eventual reality check of competition, stock prices, &c. is why market-based economies work out better in the end. But that's only a statistical guarantee, and doesn't necessarily help with specific cases, particularly when destruction is somewhat irrevocable, as with depleting wildlife populations. When a massively dysfunctional corporation couldn't really do any <i>permanent</i> damage, giving the market free rein is probably the best choice for average expected outcome.<p>And actually, in some ways regulatory agencies have more incentive to ""protect"" whatever it is they exist for--they wouldn't have jobs otherwise, and there's less likely to be the destructive short-term incentives pushing in the other direction. The flip side is that they <i>also</i> have incentive to complicate, prolong and expand the scope of whatever problem they're supposed to be ""regulating""--eventually ""protecting"" it to the point where no one wants anything to do with it because of the mountains of paperwork involved.<p>As an aside, this is why unchecked monopolies are so dangerous--no competition means no reality checks and nothing to keep the company from going off the dysfunctional deep end.",1261137358

They took the TARP money because the government made it mandatory to do so (so banks that needed it wouldn't be seen as weak in the marketplace). They simply sat on it, then repaid it with interest (20% APR, how likely is the government to get that from the bond market?!).<p>There is a paradox here: banks were simultaneously supposed to a) increase their lending and b) increase their capital reserves. Those two are mutually contradictory, and the banks chose b.<p>I'm not saying that TARP wasn't abused at all, but I will say that it presented an enormous moral hazard.

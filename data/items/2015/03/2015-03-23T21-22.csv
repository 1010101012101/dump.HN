The $108 million debt will continue to live on the books; Walker’s budget proposal for 2015-2017 will pay down no more than about $18 million of the principal.<p>> In March last year, Walker signed a $541 million tax cut for both families and businesses. At that point, Wisconsin was facing a $1 billion budget surplus through June 2015, the Journal Sentinel reported.",1427147982

9253588,comment,9252911,9253213,0,0,joeld42,,,"Animation/rigging tools seem particularly lacking to me. For example, a &quot;set driven key&quot; in maya is simple, very common action. You can do the same thing in blender, but it takes more steps and seems kind of obscure.<p>Blender often has trouble dealing with scenes at production scale. Not that it can&#x27;t do it (as the blender movie projects prove) but generally you have to know the strengths and weakness of it well to set up a scene at production scale. And to be honest, the scale of the blender shorts is pretty small compared to a typical maya production scene.<p>It&#x27;s getting better with every release though. A lot of the tools, for example the texture painting and matchmoving tools, are already better than maya. Render layers have recently caught up.<p>I think maya still has an edge in production use, but we&#x27;re starting to see blender being used in real production situations. If you look at the trajectories of development of both programs, blender is moving fast and maya is more or less sitting still.",1427147867

Nurses are well respected and (at least in SF) paid well, as they should be.<p>I can see reasons why people would want to be nurses or dental hygienists rather than developers, and vice-versa.  if you consider pay, training, the possibility of age-related discrimination, career stability, the ability to scale back for a while while you have kids without compromising your ability to get back into the field later… all in all, I think that the decision to avoid software development in favor of other career paths is a very rational one.<p>Just to be clear, I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s necessarily irrational to go into software development, at all.  It can be the right choice for some people.

9253579,comment,9251518,9252879,0,0,ffn,,,"2cool4school high school semantics aside, &quot;be awesomer&quot; is sound advice. Consider the second word &quot;awesomer&quot; (I assume this is the word you don&#x27;t like, since I can&#x27;t see anyone with a qualm against &quot;be&quot;), what is &quot;awesomer&quot;?<p>Or, more to the point, what is &quot;awesome&quot;? Well, something that fills one with awe. But what is &quot;awe&quot;? According to Dr. Dacher Keltner (Born to be Good), &quot;awe&quot; is a feeling of uplifting that one gets when he is looking on things from up high. It&#x27;s a feeling we get when we suddenly see our world and ourselves in a much larger scope; when we come to some understanding of our place, our path, and our purpose in our universe. Since time immemorial, it&#x27;s a feeling we&#x27;ve associated with divinity.<p>It&#x27;s hard to say what fills others with awe, but to be awesome from your own perspective is to do something that would fill you with awe. To &quot;be awesomer&quot; then is to be do more of that thing which fills you with purpose and meaning and (since your time and resources are finite) to do it at the cost of all the other things that just grind away at your life yet you feel no purpose, meaning, or self-actualization from.<p>So, what does &quot;be awesomer&quot; mean when translated out of uncool-high-school-faggotnese (and, incidentally, into cult-of-TEDnish)? It means to take a risk, abandon the beaten and grinding path, and to live a life that feels meaningful to you. If you ask me, that&#x27;s sound advice; possibly irresponsible if you&#x27;re a parent with kids depending on you, but definitely solid otherwise.",1427147779

My point is whether the ability to write a traditional &quot;swap&quot; is a good litmus test.<p>I&#x27;ve proved that you can write &quot;swap&quot; in Java.

That has nothing to do with whether the ability to write &quot;swap&quot; is a good litmus test.<p>The article says you cannot write &quot;swap&quot; in Java, therefore Java doesn&#x27;t have pass-by-reference.

A Unix timestamp of 1459530000 would then correspond to 2016 April 1, at 9am in San Francisco, which is one hour too early.<p>Another way to think about this: You have to apply the DST conversion rules applicable at the time the event was created, NOT the (potentially different) rules at the time the event occurs.

My point is that to management, you are a worker. You are an expense that is to be maximized for profit. That end will always be sought. You are stuck within the bounds of what they expect to pay someone for your role + wiggle room.<p>>Collective bargaining is the definition of muscling, as your other alternative is losing your entire workforce, even those happy with their work and pay. Most companies are terrified of becoming unionized because of the new and often unwarranted demands that will be made as a collective, just because of that threat.<p>Collective bargaining is legally protected and a contract stipulation employers agree to.<p>Employers can just as easily engage in manager lockout and prevent employees from working if they feel the bargain isn&#x27;t worth it.<p>>Do you imagine that unions would agree to the reverse? If the total profits have declined for a sector, do you imagine they would agree to a wage deduction? The &quot;collective bargaining&quot; aspect of modern unions is only there as a threat to ever increase benefits to the employees whether they are warranted or not.<p>To quote bsder:<p>&quot;Many of the steelworkers unions in the early 80&#x27;s went out of their way to try to get people retired so that the younger people would still have jobs. They also worked very hard to get people transferred to other sites to reach the point where they could retire even if it meant sacrificing some salary.<p>Or, for something more recent, many of the unions involved with Hostess took several rounds of cuts before finally standing up and taking a hard line that eventually led to the bankruptcy. And, it looks like Hostess is going to be better off because of it.&quot;<p>>Base pay and working conditions are law now, and are not going to revert. If they did, I would be for unions, that is what they are good for.<p>Minimum wage is law, standards are set up for most work places. Industry specific laws are in place, but they do not cover all industry specific workplace needs.<p>Tomorrow, if Keyboard X comes out, and is proven to prevent CTS, you can bet that unions would advocate for making them available.<p>> Does it? You can&#x27;t think of any companies that offer good salary and benefits with no union? None?<p>Of course I can. Do you think those niceties will last forever and for everyone? They are an expense to be cut as soon as possible.<p>> I am for more legal protection of employees. Class and regional minimum salaries (and wages) for different types of jobs, national health insurance, living wage guarantees and unemployment guarantees, retirement guarantees, etc.<p>Unions have been the vehicle for enacting legislation to provide these things at the national level. Industry will lobby against provisions if it will affect the bottom line.<p>Having a dozen programmers call your representative won&#x27;t change much in the face of lobbyists.",1427146581

</code></pre>
Why would it force anyone to upgrade? If a library exists for Rust 1.0, and then a library author releases a new version of the library with Rust 1.1 features, the Rust 1.0 library does not cease to exist. And Cargo supports semantic versioning to make it easy for library authors to inform their users when a new release is backwards-incompatible, and automatically upgrade users to new minor releases of the lib when the user has opted into receiving them. Even if a library author breaks their own backcompat and does all new feature development on a new version of Rust, thereby requiring you to upgrade your own version of Rust in order to get <i>new</i> features, the worst case scenario is that you download a new Rust compiler and all your other code continues working (hence, backwards compatibility).<p><pre><code>  > Or your favorite library author just likes nightlies,
  > which effectively forces you to run nightlies
</code></pre>
If a sufficiently-popular lib exists only on nightlies, then there will exist demand from stable users for a lib of equivalent functionality that targets a stable release. Stability is a competitive advantage! And <i>because</i> Rust can release a new minor version every six weeks, the core developers can look at what popular libraries are using the nightly branch, determine which features that library can&#x27;t live without, and then prioritize stabilizing those specific features for the next minor release. Six weeks later, that lib is suddenly using a stable release.",1427145938

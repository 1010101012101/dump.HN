People do have multiple accounts (gmail, personal domain, work, even Facebook gives you an email address you can send things to), and it's really easy to conflate ""email yourself"" with ""send an email to your account"", or even to abstract ""sending an email to yourself is secure"" to ""email is secure"".<p>My point was simply that if you make an argument about something as important as security, it's vital that you spell out the limitations to your advice. ""Email yourself"" is ambiguous enough that it needs a proper disclaimer.<p>Admittedly, the audience for Coding Horror is mostly people who know this stuff already, but it's certainly not limited to those people exclusively.

This would have to be done via some external context (e.g. cmdline switch). And that would never go away, even in a utf8 everywhere world.<p>Basically, in BOM-world:\n- You either need to tag each <i>fragment</i> of text or you still need to use external context (e.g. which encoding do I get text columns from my database)\n- You perpetually need to differentiate between binary and text data for all tools which do nothing more complicated than read and write<p>and in non-BOM-world you:\n- add to the contextual clues you need anyway something like ""any files which you are going to interpret as text on the system should be interpreted as utf8""\n- when moving data on or off the local the local system, use a network protocol which supports tagging the text payload (e.g. email, http).<p>The problems arise mostly with file shares (or their equivalent, version control systems) where text files are exchanged without an accompanying protocol. That is where ""BOM world"" or ""UTF8 world"" will ultimately have to settle their differences.<p>BOM-world would like all systems, everywhere, to make a text/binary distinction for ever.

If you've got Apple-like margins of 30% you're looking at $130 million in revenue a year (+ revenue growth that matches inflation). A software-only company might do it with less; if you're selling more physical goods you're probably going to need more.<p>Growth can substitute for that for a while, but in the long run that's about the return you're going to need to have to justify a $1 billion market cap to investors, who also have the opportunity to invest somewhere else.",1335763655

And even then they only managed to read subject lines but not email contents for those accounts.<p>Google detected them, locked them out, identified over 20 other companies that had been compromised and notified all of them.  Furthermore getting compromised was a wake-up call - they immediately took a lot of steps to improve their own security.<p>See <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2010/01/12/google-china-attacks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2010/01/12/google-china-attacks/</a> for verification of some of this.<p>So China went after the easier target - users.

3908115,comment,3907847,3907847,2,0,AgentConundrum,,,"I have to agree with this. I hadn't read Jeff's post yet since, really, I haven't regularly read his stuff in probably two or three years, but I just did.<p>The only mention of emailing things to yourself is wholly contained in the following paragraph:<p>> <i>The upside is that once you enable this, your email becomes extremely secure, to the point that you can (and I regularly do) email yourself highly sensitive data like passwords and logins to other sites you visit so you can easily retrieve them later.</i><p>To me, that's really dangerous advice. It relies on the assumption that you're only emailing things from your own gmail account, to your own gmail account. This means that the only transfer happens between you and Google over a secure HTTPS connection. Your data is transferred securely, stored on Google's servers, and securely transferred back to you when you request it.<p>At no point is this specific assumption pointed out, nor are the problems with it discussed.<p>First, although I can't think of a particular reason why gmail-to-gmail emails would be routed outside of Google's servers, that doesn't mean it doesn't happen. If someone could point a blog post discussing it, I would appreciate it.<p>Second, All bets are off if you use a separate provider. One example might be work email. If you're signed in to a work account already, you might be more inclined to just use that to toss an email at yourself for later. I've certainly done that before, even though I <i>could</i> sign into gmail from work. People could make the mistake of thinking he's saying ""send an email to yourself <i>from anywhere</i>"" which isn't correct. Incidentally, activating two-factor auth makes it <i>more</i> likely that someone would do work-to-home emailing since there's now an extra barrier to just logging into gmail.<p>Finally, this seems to rely on the assumption that you're only using the web client to access gmail. If you're using POP3 or IMAP to access your account, you could still be at risk, since I think (though admittedly I'm unsure since I only use the web interface) that these protocols aren't encrypted by default.",1335762766

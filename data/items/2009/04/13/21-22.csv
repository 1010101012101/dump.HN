Unfortunately, it seems many editors mess it up in some way :-( Kate, gedit and Geany (which I suppose is representative for all Scintilla-based editors) all expand every code block below the line your editing when you start a string.

Depending on where you are in the US, the percentage of electricity you get from renewable energy varies significantly. If we both have the same identical electric car, but you live on a mostly coal-burning grid, and I live on a mostly geothermal grid, I am a lot greener than you, despite the fact that we drive the same vehicle.<p>The reasons electric cars are a good idea is that once there is a mass adoption of them, individuals don't have to do anything more; as the grid becomes greener, everybody's car becomes greener. So it allows society to change its fossil fuel consumption much more quickly, vecause bold changes are made in the infrastructure but are transparent to users.<p>Electric cars are just one piece of the puzzle.",1239659650

Company hires guy that is foreign.  Some are coming from abroad (unfortunately some are coming from the ""sweatshop"" factories from india), while many, like myself, come young and were educated in the US, and are usually pretty good at what we do.<p>2. Foreign guy has max 6 years of staying in the country.  He needs to get something done.  He has already friends, maybe a gf/bf, maybe a house.  He is fully integrated, and wants to get a GC, so he is not amymore a ""second class human being"".   Company likes foreign guy, as he is very productive/good, whatever, so they file for GC><p>3. In order for the Green Card process to go on, the company has to demonstrate that there are not americans that want  the job.  They will have to advertise in the news papers, and internally in the company for 60 days.  If there are any suitable american employees, the process stops.  The american guy doesn't get hired,  (why would a company let go somebody that is already proved to be a good engineer?), but foreign guys application stops.<p>4. Most companies want to keep the foreign guy/girl.  He/she is already proven, so they will try to make the position available as closely to mirror what the guy's experience is.  There are clear limitations, as by law they can't request things that are unreasonable  (like foreign languages, or experience/education that is not revelant for the work).<p>This is a clear example where the ""Laws"" are out of whack with the reality and needs of companies.<p>If there have been layoffs in the company for hte past 6months, it becomes even harder for the process to move forward.<p>Now, you can say, well there are plenty of US workers that just need a little retraining blah blah lbah.<p>Well, let me give you a clear example.

A US person that has maybe few months of experience or no mobile experience at all,and his title is ""Senior Software Engineer"" doesn't necessary make him more qualified.<p>you can claim, well the company should take the time and  ""train him"", as it is the patriotic duty to do it.  \nI say bullshit.  An early stage startup might not even survive wihout the product for the whole year that this guy needs the training.  \nI'd rather have a startup hire somebody that can get product out, and be able to hire more people later,  than hire somebody that doesn't know what they are doing, just because they happen to be American, and risk everybody's job.<p>Sorry, but that is very un-american.<p>If you want to just completely stop foreign talent, you are just Detroiting silicon valley.

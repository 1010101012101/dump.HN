It&#x27;s akin to America and its export of culture (hollywood, music, tv shows, etc..).<p>You will find people that embrace it (large majority all over the world) and others who despise it with a passion and still others who are indifferent. There are those that dabble in it once in a while to see what the fuss is all about and those that actively resist it to make sure their culture doesn&#x27;t get polluted.<p>I would say for the most part, the HN community is like Quebec in Canada. Largely in love with their own culture and heritage (in this case open source stacks and Linux) with a strong feeling to keep it that away. But, Quebec also knows that English culture and the English language won&#x27;t go ahead as its too pervasive so they try to do their best to keep it in check.  Just as in Quebec, you have people that love the English culture and follow it but not too publicly.<p>I have noticed HN crowd is likely very SF focused and the biases tend to skew that away.<p>Well, so much for the analogy but at the end of the day, its part of the territory when you become as big and successful as Microsoft.

This service was replaced by Wallet, the parts highly-specific to Android were migrated, the rest of it was mostly scrapped, and what little remained was reborn as unrecognizable Google Wallet services (such as Wallet Objects). This all happened this year, and anything using Checkout that wasn&#x27;t Android was given six months notice to migrate, in most cases to third-party recommended services (such as Braintree, which was since purchased by PayPal). Again: Checkout was &quot;heavily integrated into Android and Google Play&quot; in that they purchase process for apps used it; developers even had to have Checkout accounts to sell apps, as the sales were directly reported through that interface and accounting backend.

It would be far better if the computer &quot;failed safe&quot;, so to speak.<p>Auto-lock/&quot;screensaver mode&quot; (wow, remember when computers had screensavers?) sort of does this, but the time the computer is most vulnerable (especially in any semi-public setting) is right after you dash away, not after it&#x27;s been sitting idle for 15 minutes. When a computer&#x27;s owner could come back at any minute, the best time for a social engineer to strike is the moment the owner leaves.<p>The last case especially (watching a marathon of some show with some friends) reveals an interesting bit of etiquette: it&#x27;s <i>rude</i> to lock your computer in front of friends--it implicitly suggests they&#x27;re likely to mess with it, and that you don&#x27;t trust them enough to mess with it in a way that&#x27;s merely funny, rather than potentially harmful. The great thing about an automatic proximity-based lock would be that, in going to the bathroom or whatever, the computer would <i>always</i> lock--so there&#x27;d be no decision to make which could be read into.

It&#x27;s easier just to keep the money overseas in some tax shelter or other (Apple, Google), or plow it back into the company as investment (Amazon).  Microsoft is one of the few tech companies that pays dividends.<p>Spending money on dividends looks like a poor choice.  If your share price is sagging, you can always buy back your own shares with part of your cash hoard, like Microsoft did recently.  Investors are always willing to believe that your investment will make the stock more valuable because TECHNOLOGY.

The QFE cards I remember were in a very different address range from the onboard Ethernet (which was still 8:0:20:... I think). Seems like the QFE MAC must have been in PRAM on the NIC then, at least. And I am pretty sure I remember the MAC address following the card, too.<p>The problem I ran into was that when two same-MAC ports were connected to different segments/VLANs on the same layer 2 or 3 network device, that device wouldn&#x27;t know what to do with the packets. Or it might send them down the wrong wire, which was a problem for me -- these were firewall boxes. :)<p>Eventually Sun added a boot param (or a kernel config? Set from OBP or from a shell) that would automatically number the QFE interfaces sequentially on boot. That fixed the problem for me.<p>Much later, they added the front-panel accessible smart cards that contained MAC, hostid, etc. I think that was the Netra series, intended for carrier grade RAIC installations.",1382505182

6596985,comment,6591206,6593642,4,0,rmrfrmrf,,,"Thanks for the reply! I&#x27;d love to go more in-depth with my critique. Keep in mind that, while I&#x27;m new to Django and Python, I&#x27;ve worked with PHP, Java, C++, C, and Objective-C for years. I&#x27;m familiar with writing reusable code and how to write code that is able to be read by others. I&#x27;m also an OOP fanatic, so I&#x27;m already on board with most of the conventions that are suggested by most frameworks like Django and Rails. My previous experience with Django was going through the official Django tutorial.<p>So, while I may be a weird outlier (not a beginner, but I only have a basic understanding of Python), I felt that the book was never really written for me. It lacks an authoritative tone that I want in a &quot;best practices&quot; manual, and the fact that the book spends so much time explaining <i>why</i> best practices are important really made me think that the book was meant for programming beginners. Paradoxically, the book will then randomly drop in a Python package or two without explanation and expect me to know what it is.<p>Here are some examples:<p>Using explicit relative imports -- The section explains why explicit relative imports are good. Fair enough. Then, the book provides an example of &quot;bad code&quot; with &quot;implicit relative imports&quot;. Keep in mind that you still haven&#x27;t defined &quot;explicit relative imports.&quot; Then, you explain how un-portable and un-reusable these &quot;hard coded&quot; imports are. After that, you convert the snippet to &quot;explicit relative imports&quot;. Still no definition. From here, I try to compare the two snippets. Did the authors really spend 2 pages explaining a &quot;best practice&quot; that could easily fixed by just <i>omitting the package name</i>? I honestly thought I was missing something. Then, the fact that &quot;implicit&quot; relative imports had <i>more</i> code than &quot;explicit&quot; relative imports really started messing with my head, so I decided to move on.<p>Chapter 2\nFixtures -- I wasn&#x27;t wondering why we weren&#x27;t using fixtures because I had no idea what they were (they weren&#x27;t covered in the tutorial). Simply defining fixtures would help here.<p>The rest of the chapter was all info that applies to every language and isn&#x27;t specific to Django (dev and prod should be identical, use git, etc.), so I wasn&#x27;t really getting much out of the chapter.<p>Chapter 3<p>Other Alternatives -- why?! I&#x27;m trusting you with my life here! Tell me what to do! I am yours to mold into a brilliant Django developer!<p>Chapter 6<p>Model managers -- This is where the narrative style really lead to ambiguity for me. Example 6.6 isn&#x27;t labeled as a BAD EXAMPLE, yet you lead into it with a rhetorical question. My e-reader happened split the page right after the example, so if I had stopped reading there (which is common for me with reference books), I may have not seen that, on the next page, you explain that Example 6.6 is an example of what <i>not</i> to do.<p>General\nMy problem getting acclimated to Django isn&#x27;t the third party libraries necessarily; it&#x27;s more my lack of knowledge about them at all. Throughout the book, there are tips for libraries to add to Django, but there&#x27;s hardly ever a thorough explanation or description of the product, just that you think it&#x27;s important.<p>Hope that helps! Just in case it needs to be said: none of this is an attack on you at all; I totally appreciate the work that went into this book.

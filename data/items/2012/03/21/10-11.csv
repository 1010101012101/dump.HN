3733814,comment,3730028,3733788,6,0,patio11,,,"Every subscription business will have a) people who pay for but don't use the service and b) people who pay for but don't use the service and ask for refunds.  If you ignore your emails telling you ""Thanks for signing up for AR, friendly reminder, your trial ends in 3 days."" and the subsequent ones reminding you every month, I'll happily take your money rather than second guessing your business decisions.  (I used to pester people about that but plural people literally said ""Stop pestering me!  I get it!  We bought it now but won't use it until March.  No I don't care about paying extra!  Its like $80 a month, why would I care?!"")<p>I get a notification when anyone unsubscribes and, if it looks sort of borderline (e.g. sent one test phone call on the first day, never used the service again, and then canceled on day 33) I offer to refund their money.  I get about 50% uptake on that.  This makes me sort of anomalous in the industry (take a look at e.g. 37Signals policy on refunds -- ""We.  Don't.  Refund."" -- which is much more common) but it works at my scales because AR doesn't have so many accounts at the moment that sending an email or two a week is a big tax on my time.  (And, of course, I don't lose sleep at night over $9 or $29 or $79 in revenue.  It is literally rounding error for me -- if the yen hiccups that is much more painful.)<p>At the risk of stating the obvious: the business model is not hoping that people will forget about their subscription to Appointment Reminder.  The business model is in convincing them to log into the site every day, run their business off AR, and call my cell phone at 3 AM in the morning to scream at me if anything goes wrong because <i>that way I can get them to pay me thousands of dollars</i>.",1332327578

Note that word ""ought"" though:  for a long time, the courts were more than happy to let them do that.  If he's dismayed, it's because the Supreme Court has the power to turn that particular ought into an is.<p>But this led to an odd state of affairs where so many bad patents issued where the only novelty they offered wasn't actually patentable and the patentable subject matter had already been invented.<p>[1] That was a bad pun.

Zope's module requires no patches and is being widely used.<p>I had a good experience implement this Restricted Python (unrelated to the restricted mode in Python) as a flexible sandboxing for (mostly) untrusted users. I say mostly, because DoS attacks are still possible; these are paying users and just need to be kept in their own sandbox away from others' data. There's a OS level memory restriction and runaway processes are killed by signals.<p>The Zope module works by compiling all insecure code, restricting some things that are hard to  secure and otherwise turning:  foo.bar = quux.baz into approximately: set(foo, ""bar"", get(quux, ""baz"")) --  where you provide the get and set function, so you can verify no attributes that are bad are accessed. No access to anything start with _ is allowed, and there are a few other odd restrictions like no augmented assignments.<p>This process has about 40% performance penalty however, depending on how often your verifiers need to get called during the code execution. This applies only to code you explicitly compile with their compiler, so insecure python code called from that context execute without penalty (or security!)<p>Because of the way my system is setup, the untrusted code interacts with some secure objects, so I have an ACL system where objects can declare that untrusted code can do X but cannot do Y to them.",1332324948

3733732,comment,3733594,3733594,3,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"So, ignoring the X/H thing, there's more fundamental misconceptions here:<p>1. The licensing won't change in 2015. Free use <i>was</i> set to expire (and that <i>was</i> a very bad thing) but pressure from Mozilla, Google etc. made them commit to keep it free for video provided for free for as long as the patents last to prevent WebM gaining traction.<p>2. The yearly cap goes up every (other) year by about 5% p.a. so it's already higher than the $5 million figure commonly given. This rise is however limited to about 5% p.a. so that won't change radically in the future either.<p>3. Using x264 today exposes you to just as much risk of being sued as it will after 2015 if you don't acquire the appropriate patent license (which you can do, hence it is used by big corps like Youtube)<p>4. Legally the end-user is already liable if the full delivery chain isn't licensed correctly (and again no-change afetr 2015). It would however be quite stupid to sue you unless you had more money than the rest of the chain and you were somehow making millions from your ""end-usage"".<p>5. You can create ""DRM"" roughly as strong as Flash has in HTML5. It'll just be an inconvenience though, not airtight, as the Flash stuff is. The bigger issue (which you'd think a free software magazine would pick up on) is that in order to chase this pipe dream they would happily sideline open source software.<p>6. There's no real reason you can't show adverts in HTML5 videos either. And I believe ad-blockers already work for Youtube adverts. So adverts and HTML5 can and will work together (it is after-all heavily pushed by Google) in video or any other web tech. Flash is probably just more advanced in this right now, just as it is for most other aspects of video display.<p>I'd post some corrections to the article, but it appears it only accepts Facebook logins. I guess this isn't an official FSF communication channel then.",1332324649

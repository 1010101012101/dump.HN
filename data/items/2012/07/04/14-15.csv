Often in our industry we glorify and highlight the college lifestyle of a bro-grammer. It is refreshing to read the experiences of a developer that has a life outside the domain of software development, and discusses their attempt to be creative, perform, and possibly innovate. This I think is a healthier approach for a population that will ultimately age, marry,\nand possibly have children. A population that, as they age, will ultimately struggle to further realize a desire to stay creative, productive, and relative in youth centric world without forgoing a healthy family life-balance.",1341413966

4199590,comment,4198271,4198722,3,0,slurgfest,,,"PHP is really a framework. It includes builtin routing, builtin request parsing, builtin templates, etc. All very tightly integrated. And it is definitely not just an interpreter or library.<p>And a lot of what you are listing as ""just works"" are misfeatures which break things and make life unnecessarily hard down the road. They are time bombs, because everything will seem OK up front and the problems won't occur to you until they are already serious and chronic.<p>There IS routing, it is just implicit, magical routing performed by the server by inspecting a filesystem (e.g. the same filesystem where you have code, databases, password files, configs, etc.) Exposing my internal project organization publicly as a grody looking URL scheme that will become enshrined in all my links? Oh boy!<p>I don't WANT everything magically  parsed by default, regardless of whether I need it for this request. This must happen when and how I specify or the tool is useless to me. Also: it is not a POST body, it is a request body. What do you call the body of a PUT? (And this kind of mis-education is another PHP misfeature)<p>I don't WANT random mistakes like leaving empty files to pass silently. I want bad code to fail early so I can easily detect the presence of a problem, and locate it. There is nothing worse than silent failure. If you think that silencing errors ""just works"" then you have your head in the sand. Don't think that users don't notice when a site is broken.<p>You can use a builtin framework which behaves inappropriately by default and then rewrite later, but why would you actively choose to do this?  I think that most people do not choose to do it, because they just don't know. That is why  this topic keeps coming up.<p>It is nice to nurse people along, but it is not nice to require them to nurse your tool along continuously because of all its broken behavior. Their time is better spent working on their own code rather than nursing yours. So perhaps other frameworks could somehow do an even better job of nursing users along, and those specifics are worth discussing. But that doesn't mean the right answer is to hook people on PHP's builtin framework.<p>And by the time you dress up PHP with  a third party framework and other tools to make it fit for use, which you can certainly do,  it is absolutely not easier than frameworks in other languages.",1341413241

You're really astoundingly condescending and irritable, but I'm sure you're a smart person.<p>At the end of the day, I'll say ""my bad"" for conflating Flash and ActionScript. They're not the same thing at all. I am a frequent user of Javascript both in the browser and servers, so I look fondly on most ECMAScript variants. The language is distinct from its runtime environment, which is where I find my gripes. I'll also admit that my past use of Flash is both dated and was closer to a ""script kiddie"" experience than what I do now, and while I doubt I was the worst developer ever, I was probably making bad decisions by both of our standards today.<p>But therein lies, to me, the real problem with Flash. For the sake of constructive discussion, I will just concede all your points about the stability of the plugin -- since you did make good points about Apple's accusation, let's just grant the plugin is refined, secure, and stable. I think we can agree the easy publishing of the web enables bad developers all the time. They just write their shitty code, run it through bad or no QA, FTP it somewhere and boom, users are downloading and running it. This is bad enough with the HTML/CSS/JS stack. Flash exacerbates the problem by expanding the API handles available for shitty devs to put their shitty hands on. From the ""user"" point of view, where user is not either of us but someone who only wants technology to work for them, Flash comes with a lot more bad treatment than most things on the web. Dancing hamsters merely offend; bad Javascript can break a page load; but it takes a powerful plugin like Flash to really make your computer grind gears.<p>And that gets to the crux of my argument -- CSS animations. When you start adding powerful features like that to a web technology, you know it will be abused because the web is full of shitty developers. Style sheets using these features are already crashing people's browsers (and I looked at the source for those animations -- I don't think these guys are even hacks at all). That shouldn't be happening. The world needs a stable stack of web technologies that minimize the damage bad developers can do. And this is just talking about poor code; you know the danger that a sweeping API poses in the hand of a black hat...big nod to ActiveX there. I know, the assertion that we should limit technology to account for the lowest common denominator sounds ridiculous, but do you really know of any way to stop bad developers from getting their code to run on user's devices? They seem to persist no matter what!<p>Eh, I could go on. But no one is going to see this stuff at this point. I guess we'll see what the future holds, but I think bottom line...Flash had a good 10+ year run. It was a net benefit to the web. But there are things about it we ought not repeat, especially in other mature, dependable technologies, like CSS.",1341412119

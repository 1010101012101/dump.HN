Combine that with the fact these people are well connected and intertwined, and it becomes<p>> Wealth, more evenly distributed, would give more people a greater chance at, in turn, creating more wealth.<p>Yes and no. Look at lottery winners (or other windfall recipients) as an example that the average person cannot create wealth. Some people are able to create wealth and most are not. Let&#x27;s say Bill Gates does indeed give every person that shares his picture on Facebook $5000 dollars. Most people will waste it, some will use it to pay down debt, and a small percentage will create wealth from it. I think there are two groups that could potentially benefit the most from this. Upper lower class folks can easily put this money toward education and skills that would have a net positive. Upper middle class folks might potentially start new businesses and markets which have a definite impact.<p>If people have a problem with current wealth distribution, there is a very easy (not easy in the sense of doing it, rather in understanding it) way to reallocate it - get out of debt. Debt is one of the main ways rich people get richer, by reallocating money from the poor to the rich. Getting rid of their main source of income would force them to invest in real, tangible businesses that solve real problems (because presumably without debt, nobody is buying a new TV yearly anymore). I believe debt is the primary source of economic stratification right now, not income.<p>> In terms of large corporations, I do think it would be more beneficial to split the money more evenly amongst the people who helped create the wealth.<p>Amen to this. This culture where CEOs earn 20x the average employee salary is screwed up. Also, it would be beneficial if they didn&#x27;t own every politician ever created, but that&#x27;s another story.",1389387448

7039064,comment,7037900,7037900,7,0,zackmorris,,,"It hurts sometimes to read the news, because I thought of this around 2008 or 2009 (the idea of a commodity price on items, so for example any used football might be worth about $1 and the site would know that it could buy for say 80 cents and sell for $1.20 and have practically unlimited buyers and sellers, so it would work like &quot;sell it now&quot; from seller to the site middleman who would resell at a later date).<p>I have an idea list of anywhere from a few dozen to a few hundred projects, depending on what your cutoff is for viability.  To preserve my sanity, I&#x27;ve had to divide it in half between things I would like to invent and work on, and things that I just want to exist in the world so I can use them.  Once FOBO scales I suppose it will be in the second and I will just use it.<p>Now that the cat&#x27;s out of the bag, here was my original checklist to make a tool like this:<p>1. Find a domain (anything related to yardsale is all taken). EASY<p>2. Write a mobile app that lets the user take hundreds of pictures and use image recognition or crowd sourcing to recognize the picture, find it in the database and show the bid/ask price for the item. EASY<p>3. Tally the total with a button to print QR stickers for all the items with names and prices. EASY<p>4. Have a button so the user can order the shipping boxes from the site with packing materials and shipping labels. HARD (shipping/labor)<p>5. Box arrives, user packs everything up, stuff gets scanned at the city&#x27;s warehouse and user gets the total deposited in their paypal or bitcoin. HARD (shipping/labor/financials)<p>6. When buyers purchase an item, it comes in the box from the warehouse, possibly allowing a small fee for courier service, otherwise by the next day. HARD (shipping/labor)<p>7. In the event of fraud, seller would receive a hold against their account for the price of the item they lied about, and couldn&#x27;t sell again until they paid it.  Same thing if buyer disputes a good item and it turns out they were lying.  In any event, if you are selling 100 items for $1 and a few don&#x27;t work out, it wouldn&#x27;t tend to matter all that much and most people would write off the losses as a cost of doing business and cancel their sale or order a replacement. HARD (labor)<p>Could I have gotten into ycombinator with a plan like this?  The hard part is handling shipping, warehouse/dispute labor and financials.  I could have written all of the software myself or with a small team, the only thing holding me back (as always) was capital.  I think fraud could be handled by trends in a user&#x27;s sales/purchases.  I would get rid of the notion of positive/negative ratings the way Craigslist did, since it&#x27;s a commodities market.  My original plan was to start local and just write the app and have the business be employee-owned and just hire more people as it began scaling.  Looking at it now, I can see that&#x27;s the real execution of the business and that the app&#x27;s just the idea.  It may have been an if-you-build-it-they-will-come idea that could have gone viral though, which makes me sad because now it&#x27;s in someone else&#x27;s hands.<p>Anymore, when I think of something, I generally have between about 2 weeks and 2 years before it gets invented.  I&#x27;ve been struggling with this because it&#x27;s a bit like the sci fi concept of faster starships coming along, so no matter which ship you send to a star, it will be passed by a better ship, so there&#x27;s no point in sending one in the first place.  I&#x27;ve even come to the conclusion that rewarding invention eventually will make no sense, because things will be being invented so quickly that only rewarding the first to market will hang the vast majority of inventors out to dry.  All that will matter is capital and the ability to gain access to it, as we&#x27;re seeing with incubators and kickstarter.<p>How many other people reading this feel the duality of their everyday life and what their life could be?  Spending their days struggling to make enough money to survive and knowing that every day pushes the prospect of bringing their ideas to fruition further and further from possibility?  Doing what other people want instead of the things in their nature that could potentially change the world?  To me, this is the problem of our time, at least for makers.

I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t post this but what the hell, it doesn&#x27;t matter anymore for this idea.  One down, one hundred to go..",1389384762

Each plugin seems to create it&#x27;s own cache directory within the plugins directory, so locking down file permissions is a nightmare, as well as data and functionality being mixed up half in the database, half in files scattered about the wp-content directory, or in wp-admin/tmp,  and caches also being some file based, some &#x27;transient&#x27; based in the database, and some stored for who-knows-what reason in /tmp<p>I had a plugin that one of the sites is using (RokSprocket) that if it&#x27;s missing lib-GD2, instead of saying that, throws random permissions errors, and occasional complaints about missing variables.  Another plugin, when imported wrong, causes the front page to &quot;white screen of death&quot;.<p>I upgraded one site to the latest version, and while it was sitting spinning away, accidentally clicked on another link  - which then cancelled the upgrade process, and left me with the whole site giving &quot;Down for scheduled maintenance&quot; errors.<p>All extremely frustrating, and even with WP_DEBUG on, very very little to go on to help diagnose things.  Eventually I added my own debugging info into the wp_die function, so that if WP_DEBUG is on, it would give some kind of stack trace, and from there I actually managed to figure it out, but man, a very tiring week.<p>I think the thing is, that PHP would be great as a templating language, a kind of &quot;jinja2 when you need a bit of functionality, say a couple of sql queries, thrown in as well&quot;.  So if I could have a static site generator which gave me php for embedding search, RSS feeds, and &quot;most viewed posts&quot; kinds of things.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m glad PHP is developing, wordpress really does seem like quite a decent platform for non-tech-savvy blogging and reasonably simple static-ish sites, once I&#x27;ve locked it all down and got everything working well.",1389384465

Perhaps it&#x27;s coincidental, but I’d like to call out a possible conflation, because it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve seen expressed from time to time on Hacker News, and I think it perpetuates erroneous beliefs about poverty.<p>Krugman here is talking about the <i>very</i> poor; this is a relative statement, and it is almost a tautology to say that most of them don&#x27;t work. (Rather, one should be quite scandalized that anyone who works could still be very poor.)  Whatever the merit or relevance of his point may be, he’s not trying to characterize the conditions of poverty. He&#x27;s trying to express the scale of the wealth disparity between rich and poor, and point out that a simple model of rent-seeking cannot account for it.<p>‘Poverty’ itself is a somewhat relative term, but only somewhat.  People recognize hardship when they experience it, and a plateau in the relation between happiness and wealth has been identified.  At some point down the sloping portion of that relation, we have to recognize poverty.<p>I do not think that any scholar has disputed that there are a significant number of Americans who work as much as they can, willingly, and yet live in poverty.  One can argue whether <i>most</i> of the impoverished have work, but one cannot dismiss those that do.  It is inhumane and does not honour their effort.<p>Maybe they are stupid people, with bad lives, who make bad decisions.  Let’s allow every secret prejudice we have, just so long as we do not ignore that they work and go wanting for things we regard as essential.  It is not by choice nor lack of action that they experience hardship.  There is no more justice to their income than there is justice in the grades of a bell curve.  They cannot work any harder or smarter than they are working already.",1389384320

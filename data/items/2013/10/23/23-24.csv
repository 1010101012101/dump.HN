The modern vendor library I was using took about a minute to compute.<p>I searched through some old archives and found a scanned in PDF of the algorithm I wanted to implement from a late 60s fortran implementation. I converted it to node.js and Presto! The thing takes the exact same inputs, gives the exact same outputs, and does it all in... 35 milliseconds.<p>With the complexity of the algorithm and size of the dataset I am pretty sure it would have taken a mainframe the size of a warehouse and weeks to compute back then, but it showed me that the underlying data structures and mathematics have not changed in the least.<p>I have always tried to take it to heart that &quot;we stand on the shoulders of giants&quot; and all that, but this was really a turning point for me over the last few weeks, that many of the greats from the past would make us all look like morons if they were around today.<p>There are implementations of this algorithm in C, C++, Java, Python, Javascript, and probably others, but they are all at least an order of magnitude slower than the one that came out back then, given the same modern hardware, even in a language that is not exactly known for its computational prowess.",1382572702

6602592,comment,6601748,6602301,15,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"> Please don&#x27;t mention the iPad as a pinnacle of anything. It is not. It is merely a rehash of old technologies packed into a slick exterior and heavily marketed. It is more a tool of social status than a utility. Compare this to the HP Compaq TC1100, which was a tablet computer released seven years before the first iPad and the specifications of which trumped those of the iPad by double.<p>The iPad is more than heavily marketed dribble; it was actually usable when compared to the TC1100, and basically &quot;realized the dream&quot; of tablet computing when predecessors couldn&#x27;t: specifications are shit, usability is king. Engineers often don&#x27;t get that.<p>> As for being victims of a constrained Von Neumann mindset, perhaps so. On the other hand I haven&#x27;t really noticed any non-Von Neumann languages that are too practical for human purposes. Languages like APL and FP are quite esoteric...<p>CUDA dominates the HPC world right now; MapReduce dominates big data processing. Vector machines and data-parallel pipelines have won big in their own domains. And I&#x27;m not even going to talk about relational database, all of which are very non Von Neumann computing models and have been very successful.",1382572458

6602559,comment,6599318,6599318,2,0,langer,,,"This type of question is most relevant to people considering which ecosystem in which to base their company, or part of it.<p>Having spent 2007-2012 doing a startup in London and the past year doing a startup in Silicon Valley, I&#x27;ve experienced both sides. I also had Silicon Valley investors in the first startup and spent time here every year since 2007.<p>London is catching up in some areas and you have to break the question down to make it useful. I&#x27;d look at the following areas that make Silicon Valley what it is:<p>Funding<p>- Not much difference in availability of investors but you&#x27;ll get roughly double the amount of capital at double the valuation at each stage in Silicon Valley.<p>- Reason for similar availability is that there is at least an order of magnitude more investors at seed/early stages in Silicon Valley but a similar proportion more startups.<p>- At seed/early stage, Silicon Valley investors have higher expectations for growth and London investors have higher expectations for business model validation.<p>- Silicon Valley was much further ahead 5 years ago due to fewer investors in London and fewer startups in Silicon Valley.<p>- In London the tax incentives for seed investing and VC firms started by successful entrepreneurs (Atomico, Notion, ProFounders etc.) are changing this.<p>- In Silicon Valley, YC and its copycats are creating more high quality startups.<p>- At later stages, investors are still almost all American but they are comfortable investing across the pond by then.<p>Talent<p>- Proportionally more top people in Silicon Valley than in London across all functions.<p>- You&#x27;ll pay 50-70% of the salary for people of an equivalent level in Silicon Valley and the cost of living is similar to London.<p>- Hiring is an order of magnitude less competitive in London than in Silicon Valley.<p>Acquirers<p>- Silicon Valley is dramatically better. London has no talent acquisition market and because all the active large acquirers are in Silicon Valley, they prefer local deals. This feeds all the way down to early-stage valuations which need to be so low in order to tie up with the poor exit market in London.<p>Ambition and role models<p>- One of the biggest differences. Mentality of being best in the world is far more ubiquitous in Silicon Valley than London.<p>- This has serious implications for you as a founder as your ambition levels are heavily influenced by the people you surround yourself with.<p>Accessibility of a large market<p>- Most billion dollar addressable markets you can target are mainly composed of the US market.<p>- For cultural reasons on the consumer side and relationship-building reasons in B2B, it&#x27;s much easier to win the large markets when starting in Silicon Valley.<p>Overall London is catching up and one $10B+ success story will accelerate closing of the gap, but there are some structural reasons that mean there&#x27;s always likely to be gap.<p>I wrote a guest post discussing the growth of London a couple of years ago, and things have continued in the same direction since: <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/27/the-european-startup-ecosystem-arrived-but-paul-carr-wasnt-paying-attention/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/27/the-european-startup-ecosys...</a>",1382572001

Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna. Enjoying the warmth of the early afternoon sun, the American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish.<p>How long did it take you to catch them? the American casually asked.<p>Oh, a few hours, the Mexican fisherman replied.<p>Why dont you stay out longer and catch more fish? the American businessman then asked.<p>The Mexican warmly replied, With this I have more than enough to support my familys needs.<p>The businessman then became serious, But what do you do with the rest of your time?<p>Responding with a smile, the Mexican fisherman answered, I sleep late, play with my children, watch ballgames, and take siesta with my wife. Sometimes in the evenings I take a stroll into the village to see my friends, play the guitar, sing a few songs<p>The American businessman impatiently interrupted, Look, I have an MBA from Harvard, and I can help you to be more profitable. You can start by fishing several hours longer every day. You can then sell the extra fish you catch. With the extra money, you can buy a bigger boat. With the additional income that larger boat will bring, before long you can buy a second boat, then a third one, and so on, until you have an entire fleet of fishing boats.<p>Proud of his own sharp thinking, he excitedly elaborated a grand scheme which could bring even bigger profits, Then, instead of selling your catch to a middleman youll be able to sell your fish directly to the processor, or even open your own cannery. Eventually, you could control the product, processing and distribution. You could leave this tiny coastal village and move to Mexico City, or possibly even Los Angeles or New York City, where you could even further expand your enterprise.<p>Having never thought of such things, the Mexican fisherman asked, But how long will all this take?<p>After a rapid mental calculation, the Harvard MBA pronounced, Probably about 15-20 years, maybe less if you work really hard.<p>And then what, seor? asked the fisherman.<p>Why, thats the best part! answered the businessman with a laugh. When the time is right, you would sell your company stock to the public and become very rich. You would make millions.<p>Millions? Really? What would I do with it all? asked the young fisherman in disbelief.<p>The businessman boasted, Then you could happily retire with all the money youve made. You could move to a quaint coastal fishing village where you could sleep late, play with your grandchildren, watch ballgames, and take siesta with your wife. You could stroll to the village in the evenings where you could play the guitar and sing with your friends all you want.<p>Sensing skepticism from the fisherman, the businessman moves onto the next boat and finds a more receptive fisherman. The two, sensing an obvious business opportunity, decide to go into business together. They raise a venture capital round and a year later, return to the pier outfitted with a dozen high tech fishing boats.<p>Immediately, the price of tuna at the pier drops threefold with increased supply, forcing the young Mexican fisherman to increase his hours at sea just to maintain his existing standard of living.<p>Shortly thereafter, all of the shallow water tuna have been caught and the young Mexican fisherman discovers his tiny boat is incapable of deep water fishing. Because of his limited savings, he does not have enough capital to invest in a deep water fishing boat and he is forced to sell his tiny fishing boat for pennies on the dollar as scrap because advances in technology have made it obsolete.<p>After discovering that there is limited demand for an employee whose only skills are watching ballgames, playing the guitar and taking siestas, the young Mexican fisherman finds his only option is to take a job working minimum wage on one of the businessmans fishing vessels.<p>Several years later, the fishermans joints are shot through from the hard manual labor of operating on a commercial fishing vessel and an ill timed lift of a 150lb pallet of tuna finally causes his back to give way, causing permanent crippling. The fisherman discovers intensive lobbying from the businessman has weakened workplace protection rules and the fisherman is summarily let go with only a paltry settlement.<p>After years of expensive medical treatments and crippling bills, the fisherman is finally forced to sell his land, passed along to him from generation to generation, to a development conglomerate run by the businessman who is buying large tracts of the entire village.<p>Unbeknownst to the fisherman, the businessman has lobbied for the village to turn into a protected nature reserve, allowing for the rehabilitation of the environment and the restocking of fish in its pristine waters. The businessman painstakingly recreates the quaint, costal charm of the village he once visited, making it a paradise where the wealthy flock to when they want to retire into a life of easy indolence.<p>Finally, 15  20 years after the original conversation, the fisherman and his wife are found dead in a homeless shelter. Meanwhile, the businessman retires to the village having made two successive fortunes first in fisheries and then in real estate development. He spends his days sleeping late, playing with his grandchildren, watching high def ESPN ballgames on a 70 TV, and taking siesta with his wife. He occasionally strolls down to the village in the evenings where he regales his fellow millionaires with the story of how he found an unexploited niche in the marketplace and then took full advantage of it to make the fortune that got him to the comfortable retirement he enjoys today.",1382571940

If the zookeeper cluster dies you lose everything.<p>Generally if a clustered load-balancer dies and another takes over there&#x27;s a half second or a couple seconds of transition, but you&#x27;re back up and running with a very simple architecture. If all of your load-balancers die, something much bigger to worry about is going on.<p>Really all this does is place the failure mode into a higher-level service with a much greater potential for failure. Zookeeper even makes you specify the size of your cluster and in my experience it&#x27;s difficult to live update this.

If your installation needs more than this then I&#x27;m certain you could get a layer to distribute the load-balancing between a set.

6602542,comment,6600784,6602267,5,0,jayro,,,"This is a valid sentiment / concern that was also raised in the comments section of the Google+ post. Here&#x27;s a mildly edited version of my response.<p>...<p>When you don&#x27;t formalize the challenges, the kids just kind of meander, don&#x27;t get much accomplished and things start to devolve into chaos. I know there&#x27;s been a bunch in the press lately about how if you just poke a hole in a wall and stick a computer in it the kids will teach themselves differential equations or something and then of course teach it to a bunch of the other kids (believe me, I&#x27;d love it if it were that easy), but that&#x27;s not been our experience at all. Not remotely. We&#x27;ve tried that a number of times in a number of different ways (because you know - it&#x27;s easy) and when you&#x27;re feeling burned out from work or didn&#x27;t have time to write up a bunch of challenges, it&#x27;s something you can rationalize trying, but we&#x27;ve NEVER seen that work. Occasionally, one of the kids will look something up on the web or figure something out on their own and tell the other kids about it, but that rarely gets them very far.<p>...<p>Just to add to this a bit in the form of a slightly different technology. I bought a few Mindstorm kits last year for the class, wrote up a bunch of easy to read documentation and examples and basically told them to go at it, but even with that and the occasional soft intervention, not a whole lot happened in terms of learning. And we tried this a number of times throughout the year. Sure, they learned a few basic concepts, but the efficiency was extremely low, and nothing much was learned that was transferable. This is also pretty much the same story I heard from every well-meaning, thoughtful and supportive parent who bought their &quot;gifted&quot; kid a Mindstorm kit. They basically played with it a few times, mostly with the legos and then gave up and left it in the corner.<p>...<p>In regards to the concern about teaching to the test, I make up new challenges every week based on how the kids are progressing, what they&#x27;re struggling with, what they&#x27;re excited about, what the next logical learning step might be, etc., so it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s something static that they can optimize against or cynically &quot;game&quot; without actually learning how to code.<p>Also, while we&#x27;re very focused on whether they&#x27;re having fun, exploring and being creative, at this stage the primary goal is to give them enough fundamental skills to be able to do ANYTHING interesting. I mean it takes a lot of work to get them even to that point, and we&#x27;re not there yet. And the thing is that we&#x27;re competing against very attractive distractions like Mindcraft and YouTube, as well as all the homework they have to do and the other activities they&#x27;re involved in, so it&#x27;s not like being relentless task masters would even fly with them. They&#x27;d simply quit.<p>To sum it up, what we&#x27;re attempting to do is extremely hard. We&#x27;re not idiots. And we&#x27;re really trying. I&#x27;ve probably read just about every related article that&#x27;s popped up on HN over the past two years, plus 100 others on learning theory and creativity, but a lot of these articles are just people spouting off who&#x27;ve never really tried it in the real world for any length of time or with kids this young, and I can tell you that a lot of it just doesn&#x27;t work, or not to the degree that you may have been lead to believe. Look, I can&#x27;t speak for what works for a every group of kids in every context, but what we&#x27;re doing seems to be working, the kids are having a blast, and if we keep up this pace I think the kids might actually be able to do some real stuff within the next few months, which, in my opinion, would really be something.",1382571746

Here is the text in the meantime:<p><i>So after waiting all day all the iWork Mavericks updates showed up in the MAS. With great trepidation I waited for them to download. Would all the problems users had been sending to Apple the past 4 years finally be fixed? The announcement today of a total rewrite might mean that Numbers finally had some speed and could take at least some of the workload wed had to use Excel for. For many people being able to get rid of Excel would be welcome. Yet a rewrite might also mean a few fixes more oriented towards the iOS versions rather than how many pros and small businesses use iWork. I know I have a huge number of scripts  often with complicated hacks to get around the limits in Pages and Numbers incomplete Applescript Dictionaries.<p>Heres the bad news. They wont work now. Effectively Applescript support is gone. Numbers doesnt even have a dictionary. And Pages has had nearly everything removed.<p>I could go on about how almost none of the problems Ive been griping about for four years in Numbers have been fixed. But whats the point. Apple has spoken. It wants the OSX iWork to basically be the same as the iOS version and designed purely for casual use. By making it free they kill the market for any competitors other than Office. So if you run a small office, even if you hate MS-Office, theres really no alternative anymore.<p>The bigger question is what this means about Applescript. But I think thats clear. Despite a session at WWDC which raised my hopes, clearly Apples completely abandoned it. Theres no scripting for so many of their apps and so little evangelism that its hardly surprising so few 3rd party apps now support it.<p>What I suspect Apple doesnt realize is how much small business and small shops workflow depends upon Applescript. Casual use is fine. But a lot of people do more. It wouldnt be so bad were there an alternative. This isnt just like Apple not upgrading the MacPro. This is like Apple not upgrading the MacPro for four years, then announcing that the MacMini is the new MacPro.

6602497,comment,6601515,6601515,47,0,ot,,,"As Guido says, 1-based indexes basically force closed ranges, so that [1, length] is the full array.<p>One thing that annoys me about closed ranges (and it&#x27;s not much talked about) is that it is impossible to express the empty range: in python [i:i] is an empty range, while closed ranges always contain at least one element. That makes closed ranges <i>strictly</i> less expressive than half-open ranges, making often necessary to write special cases for zero-length.<p>For example when you want to split an array or a string at a given position i, the partitions will always be a[:i] and a[i:] <i>even if one of the two is empty</i>.<p>The other big issue, as many comment, is that the arithmetic to index multi-dimensional arrays is cumbersome with 1-based indexing: for example if I is a 2d image in row-major, the element (x, y) is at position I[(y - 1) * width + x] instead of I[y * width + x]. It&#x27;s very easy to do off-by-one errors this way.<p>EDIT: adding this just to try some ASCII art :)<p>I think that the preference about 0-based and 1-based indexing boils down to how you reason about indexes.<p>I (0-indexing) think of them as the following:<p><pre><code>      |-|-|-|...|-|\n      ^           ^\n    first   past-the-end\n   position\n</code></pre>\nthat is, the index is <i>where the element begins</i>. This way there is a special endpoint, the &quot;past-the-end&quot;, where the an appended element would begin. In particular, an empty array has both first and last endpoint equal to 0.<p>I believe that people who favor 1-based indexing think like this<p><pre><code>      |-|-|-|...|-|\n       ^         ^\n    first      last\n   element    element\n</code></pre>\nthat is, in the <i>ordinal</i> way, i is the i-th element.",1382571177

He said that when he was out fundraising it defused a lot of tension when VCs and angels would ask about his open source policy and he could say &quot;well, I keep some of my hardest algorithms in a closed repo.&quot; As a game, we have the art, which I agree is a pretty substantial barrier to copying us (many tens of thousands of dollars in our case), but would you still recommend 100% open source vs 90 or 95%?</i><p>Well, you have users beating down your door.  Fundraising is never easy, but you&#x27;ll have a much easier time with it due to your popularity.  And if Sequoia are smart, they will invest in you, because you&#x27;ve discovered an entirely new game design.  Historically, whenever someone has invented a game design that turns out to be immensely popular (Pong, Doom, Minecraft, etc), that&#x27;s almost always resulted in the company becoming a hugely successful game studio.  So if you focus on growing your community and on keeping the game fun, then it&#x27;s quite plausible your studio will be hugely successful too.<p>Additionally, if you release your code 100% open source, you will get an <i>insane</i> amount of goodwill from the gamedev community.  Right now the community is starved for examples of open-source games <i>that actually work</i>.  Right now newbie programmers can go find some code snippets for various little tasks, little parts of a game&#x27;s engine, like how to draw a sprite.  But a tangible, cohesive product?  Something that newbie programmers can git clone and actually run, and which actually functions?  That&#x27;s almost unheard of.  (Quake and Doom engines are open source, but they don&#x27;t provide any art assets, so newbie programmers can&#x27;t download the code and do anything useful with it.)  And that&#x27;s a very good position to be in, because it&#x27;s unheard of in the same way Rails was unheard of before it became popular.  Meaning, if you do it, then you&#x27;ll earn the instant loyalty of thousands of indie gamedevs.  The wonderful PR you&#x27;ll receive will be such a huge benefit to your company that it seems totally unjustified for anyone to be concerned that someone will steal your idea by stealing your code.  (For what it&#x27;s worth, I know of exactly zero times it&#x27;s happened in practice.  Code theft is a very overblown concern, especially in a hits-based industry like game development.)<p>You&#x27;ll also enjoy many intangible benefits derived from open sourcing a fully functional game.  For example, after Rails became popular, 37signals probably found it much easier to find and hire talent, since they were a sexy company to work for.  I would bet you&#x27;ll wind up in the same position.  In fact, just thinking about you open sourcing this game makes me want to go work for you.  If newbie gamedevs can download it, run it, learn how it works, tweak it, and become inspired to make thier own games... well, that&#x27;s what gamedev is all about.  It&#x27;s why kids want to be gamedevs rather than other kinds of devs.  So you&#x27;ll be a huge boon to the gamedev community, which means talented people will want to work for you because of it.",1382570343

That doesn&#x27;t mean $179+contract wasn&#x27;t a relatively expensive phone, though.<p>First, I agree with you, it doesn&#x27;t send the right message to US devs.  Openness aside, it doesn&#x27;t do much to incentivize developing for it.  I&#x27;d very likely buy a Nexus 4-level device and love it and develop for it.  I don&#x27;t know what Sony has scheduled, but maybe that would fit?  If not, if you know of any on the horizon, I&#x27;d love to hear about it.<p>Second, the target market really isn&#x27;t the US.  Making a premium phone the flagship device wouldn&#x27;t be representative of the low-end of the market, which is what they&#x27;re really targeting, and is much bigger than the US anyway.  The ZTE Open <i>is</i> pretty representative of their target audience, possibly more powerful than most.

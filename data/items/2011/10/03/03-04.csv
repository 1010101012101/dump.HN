They're the children of working professionals, federal government employees, etc. They have had comfortable upbringings, but their families don't have ""fuck you"" money.<p>They've been pushed and prodded all their life by parents who, like everyone else without ""fuck you"" money, are desperately afraid of falling out of the middle class. Most of the kids don't know it yet, and maybe the parents don't consciously acknowledge it, but it's a major force underlying the thinking of every parent who sends his kid to an SAT prep class so he can get a high score and go to Yale.<p>At the same time, regular jobs suck. Thanks to the consultants, they're overly structured, have shitty benefits, and workers are managed by PHB's who don't know jack-shit about the jobs that the workers do. Upward mobility is curtailed, because many F500's prefer to hire managers from the ranks of consultants, instead of promoting people from within. The risk in potentially more interesting jobs is high: fail to make it big, and you could be stuck in a job where you get yelled at for punching in a couple of minutes late and to the extent that you're lucky enough to get health insurance, it'll be on a shitty plan. Thankfully science/tech is mercifully insulated from this phenomenon (so far), but many students don't have the particular aptitude or desire for those fields.",1317614279
3064980,comment,3063359,3064772,5,0,a1k0n,,,"Some of the really compact formulae are trial-and-error stuff, but it doesn't have to be.  You can make an arbitrarily complicated software synthesizer with this thing, and if you just want to compose algorithmic music in a ""constructivist"" way, you can do something like this:<p><pre><code>    SS=function(s,o,r,p){var c=s.charCodeAt((t>>r)%p);return c==32?0:31&t*\n    Math.pow(2,c/12-o)},SS(""0 0     7 7     037:<<"",6,10,32) + (t&4096?SS(\n    ""037"",4,8,3)*(4096-(t&4095))>>12 : 0)\n</code></pre>\nSo I've defined a function ""SS"" which stands for sawtooth wave applied to sequencer -- where a sequencer takes an ASCII representation of notes and a speed and a base octave, and converts them into relative note frequencies, and then the sawtooth wave synth is done by 31&t*<multiplier> -- which is a number that cycles between 0 and 31 at a frequency determined by the multiplier.  Just typing ""31&t"" into the code will give you a sawtooth wave at 8000/32 = 250Hz which is either a flat middle C or a sharp B below that.  8000 being the sample rate, 32 being the number of steps in the wave generated by ""t&31"".<p>So one of those is synthesizing a bassline and the other one is an arpeggio that starts and stops when t&4096 is true, which means it's ""off"" for about half a second and ""on"" for about half a second (8000/4096 to be precise).  Add the bassline to the arpeggio and you get both voices at once.<p>My version has a textarea just so I could put things like that together.  The OP, however, is less interested in the constructivist approach and more in the trial-and-error approach where you find something that can be implemented in 10 bytes of assembler and it magically produces a symphony.",1317614272

No, seriously.<p>Sites like HN and Reddit tend to have a vocal crowd who decide that certain languages and tools are the domain of the elite. This groupthink is religiously defended through self-righteous blog posts (""I switched from Java to C and became a better person!!!"") and comment threads. Inevitably, posters go looking for something that the True Language is known to do well, and then overgeneralize their experience. The result? Karma, and another voice to add to the constant din of Conventional Wisdom. Intellectual honesty takes a backseat to conformity...as usual.<p>Developers looking to improve their skills should pick up new languages, especially those of different paradigms and abstraction levels. But the hegemony of 'superior' languages will always weigh in to these decisions, and potentially block out the idea that the language is merely a tool used in implementing the final solution.

3064962,comment,3064875,3064875,0,0,jerf,,,"""So why does the term “elite” become attached to certain languages over others?""<p>Because the causality flows the other way. At any given point in time, there are certain languages that the elite programmers tend to flock to, because they spend more time looking out for new, good things that the average person (part of what got them to ""elite"" in the first place), and therefore finding someone who knows that language is evidence (though not proof) that they are elite.<p>That's not a logical fallacy; in Aristotelian logic, (A -> B) !-> (B -> A), but you can use probabilistic logic to combine ""A -> B"" and ""B"" to update the probability of A (when combined with a couple of other values). And that's how you get certain languages associated with elite programmers, even though the languages itself does not confer eliteness. It's actually all-but-inevitable that such processes occur in any community of sufficient size that has any sort of skill ramp. There's going to be at least one identifiable group that is the ""cutting edge"", and they are going to have certain characteristics or tastes or whatever that will tend to separate them from the not-cutting-edge folk.",1317613676

I sometimes entertain the thought of once again working for a university. So I'm afraid I'm not very shy about potentially insulting my own social class. ;)<p>And I'm sorry the subject makes me angry. But it makes me angry! For example, the fact that most of my own published work is trapped behind expensive paywalls makes me very unhappy.<p>And I use the phrase <i>ivory tower</i> not as a mere gratuitous insult, but because it's the metaphor that seems to fit.

3064956,comment,3064664,3064664,14,0,EGreg,,,"Man, I could write volumes regarding meeting people. I made a study of it because I was very interested. Now I should put it into practice. I was just too disorganized/lazy to take my own advice.<p>First of all, organizing things that others will enjoy is certainly a great way. But you also have to motivate people to bring their friends, otherwise you'll always be seeing the same people. People bring their friends when there is something they really want them to experience, so that's what you should focus on.<p>Also, meeting people is a great way to realize that you can outsource responsibilities to others, something that can actually ""scale"". Often this allows you to network to the right people. The key here is not to be perfect, and not to put too much responsibility on yourself. For example, you want to bring together two groups of people (men and women, say, or investors and entrepreneurs) that would really like to meet each other. You want to cultivate an aura of quality (i.e. the men and women are exceptionally attractive for whatever reason) and selectiveness in order to inspire people to perpetuate this selectiveness and recommend it to their friends. Suddenly the experience is created not just by you, but by this self perpetuating aura of exclusivity.<p>Being the facilitator and helping people meet each other actually gets you a lot of points, which you can use later when you need a favor yourself.<p>If you're coming as a guest, though, there is a real economics that starts happening, and a currency. Perhaps it is unfortunate from an idealistic point of view, but that's the way it works in many conferences, nightclubs, etc.<p>In general, though, if you want to come to events as a guest, you probably want to be invited either by the organizer or by a regular. If it's the organizer, you'd ideally like to bring some ""high quality"" friends to the event (such as fellow smart engineers) and introduce them to the organizer, so the organizer will want to invite you again.<p>Additionally you can form a little ""group"" that tells each other about events and invites each other. At these events, when you talk to someone important, you can tout the other people in the group instead of bragging about yourself, and they would do the same for you. As a result, you are able to meet many more people through your ""network"" who is out there meeting people in 10 different places and filtering them for you, because you yourself can be in only one place at a time.<p>How to start motivating people you know to start networking wherever they are and mentioning you when the opportunity comes up? You have to start doing it for them first. Ask for their business cards.  You have to hook people up with opportunities and then ask them to go out and do the same for you. Give them your business cards.",1317613493
3064955,comment,3063829,3064609,5,0,mcherm,,,"Under certain circumstances, Yes.<p>Would it be moral, do you think, for a parent in Nazi German to lie when asked if their child was half Jewish in order to prevent the child from being taken away to the concentration camps? In my mind, it would -- and it would be a good lesson for the child: that truth is LESS important than saving a human life.<p>Now suppose that the situation were more starkly clear-cut than it is here. Suppose that the jack-booted thugs knocked on the door and demanded to know whether your child was A or B. If A, then the child would get an excellent education and have an opportunity to demonstrate their potential in life. If B, then the child would receive no education beyond 5th grade and would be prohibited for the remainder of their life from making a living in any profession other than drug dealer. I don't know about you, but in this case too I would think it moral to lie and claim A when the child was actually B. This lie hurts no one, and it saves a human's potential, if not technically their life. I even think it would make a good life lesson for the child.<p>What about this case? The extremists may think that the choice of urban or suburban school IS a case of ""chance in life"" vs ""drug dealer"", but the reality is much less clear cut. Some people who attend poor urban schools DO succeed in spite of the disadvantages. But many more of them do not. The lie may not be justified in this case. But if you agreed with me on one or both of the hypothetical cases above, then you should see that it is a matter of degree, NOT a stark absolute -- a decision that requires careful consideration of the degree of institutional injustice that your lie serves to combat, and a decision that persons of wisdom and ethics may disagree on.",1317613492

I've never heard the ""Elite Programming Language"" term before I saw it deconstructed in this essay.<p>Most discussion around programming languages I see these days is centered around assessment of developer skills. This is understandable -- we're going through a period of massive technical talent shortage. Almost all tips we read through places like HN, including PG's notes, revolved around shorthand ways to screen developers, not pushing a one-true-language approach (unless Yahoo Store programming skills are at stake, apparently..)<p>Unlike, say, the mid 1970s, when IBM could take its sweet time training you to program, startups don't have a lot of time to make something happen. Thus, they need a language (and application framework) that will work well, and they need developers that they are reasonably sure will be able to succeed.

Those people will not be unduly dismayed when they need to reverse engineer a wireline protocol one day, and 'pick up couchbase' the next.<p>All this to say, sure, there's no such thing as an elite language.

If something cannot be made to be more profitable compared to its alternatives, assuming they are all priced fairly in order to to cover external costs equally, then it is not the most efficient. What economist would argue in favor of that?<p>It's quite a consistent argument when I say that I am in favor of taxing gas and automobiles. In fact, I think they should be taxed at much higher rates, to internalize the costs that are currently being externalized. Ideally, the costs of roads and bridges are covered by those taxes. Thus they're usage-based and not subsidized by those not using them.<p>I'm not sure why you think the best way to internalize the costs of car usage is to subsidize public transportation. That's just backwards thinking.<p>As car usage becomes more expensive due to taxation, cities will become more dense. This is the point where we can start talking about building infrastructure for public transportation, that will then make economic sense thanks to population density. It makes no sense to have a bus meander around the suburbs for hours to pick up a few riders, all traveling to different parts of town. It's an impossible idea. You have to have density first. Tax cars and gas so that they pay for their own infrastructure and environmental consequences, and density will be a natural outgrowth, at which point public transportation will be more viable.",1317612503

Even if sweep floors, flip burgers, wash pots, and act as a security guard, will be able to do a terrific job getting children ready for college and life.<p>My good news is that don't have to move to some neighborhood with all millionaires.  Instead, quite sufficient is JUST ""do no harm"" and a 'social atmosphere'.  Academically relaxed is also good.<p>This is a radical recommendation:  For good work in actually learning for college and life, mostly don't depend on the school.  Don't mostly depend on the school even if in one of the best school districts in the country or even are sending children to one of the best private schools.<p>Why?  Again, yet again, to repeat, bluntly the K-12 teachers don't know enough to teach much of anything to be taken very seriously.  The K-12 years are some of the very best years for learning, and it is a grand disaster that those years are turned over to the K-12 system and, thus, largely wasted.<p>Also implied but not stated was, get the heck into college level material ASAP.  In the US, the good academic material starts in college and continues into graduate and professional school.  K-12 is wildly different and, academically, is a really bad joke -- mostly can just skip it.  For most parents who want good education for their children, this is radical but good advice.<p>With my advice, careful parents, and a one-room school house in a serious, rural farming community will totally knock the socks off ANYTHING in formal K-12 education.<p>For your:<p>""Also, it can be very hard to support real learning at home if you are a single parent working two or three jobs to make ends meet.""<p>True.<p>So:  (1) Young people, listen up:  Work however hard is necessary to form stable marriages and, really, stable, larger families.  Marriages and families are IMPORTANT.  Again, listen up.<p>(2) Unless you want a series of disasters for the rest of your life, delay having children until you can form a stable marriage.<p>(3) In the home, set up a 'culture' of learning instead of TV, cars, fashion frocks, popularity competitions, cell phone gossip, pop culture, fast food, sports, wild parties, etc.<p>Then, get the children started and going on learning, largely independently, ASAP.  Then the children can learn on their own time with minimal time from parents, so little that there still is a chance for a single parent.<p>But this matter of a 'culture' of learning is just CRUCIAL.  If there is any doubt about the culture in your home, then disconnect the TV.  Keep children away from 'pop culture'.  Emphasize LEARNING and, then, curiosity.",1317612241

(Presumably, these businesses don't need the smart people most of the time, which is why they don't have them as employees.)  At least superficially, this seems like an appropriate use of smart people: target them at the problems where they are needed, which are dispersed across many businesses.<p>Now, if finance and consulting are actually sectors that aren't contributing to society (a net drain), then there's a real problem.

3064892,comment,3062728,3062842,4,0,grayrest,,,"I respectfully disagree. I've been a Vim user for 10 years. I've written half a dozen plugins and customized another 15 or so in addition to writing several syntax/indent files. I decided to take a look at Sublime last week when I noticed that it had a vim mode coming from the author (important in that it has a chance of not sucking) that looked like a work in progress but at a reasonable state. I've since paid my $60 and am in the process of switching despite the vi emulation's flaws irritating me to no end.<p>Advantages:<p>- Scripting system is in Python and is a joy to work with. Easy things are easy. Hard things seem acheivable but I haven't done serious plugin work. You can poke around/debug things using the built in Python REPL. The things I have tried to do are considerably easier than they are in Vim.<p>- Scope system. You can accomplish a significant set of activities with keybindings and scopes that would require a vim plugin. I've wanted scopes in Vim since I read about them when Textmate was announced. There isn't a technical reason it's not doable but it would require a complete rewrite of all the syntax files to be consistently useful. Enables things like go-to-function, select scope, and fold tag attributes to work without filetype specific plugins.<p>- Native Snippets. You can get snippets in Vim (I've contributed patches to both plugins) but nested placeholders and nested snippets just don't work, which really limits how far you can push snippets. Also Vim snippets can't interact with the selection and snippets containing indention tend to work incorrectly/interact with the indent script strangely. The only downside is that it's easier to invoke code from SnipMate than it is in Sublime. Being able to do snippets directly from keybinds cuts out another small class of plugins and due to the interaction between scopes, snippets, and keybinds this class is larger than you'd think.<p>- True multi-cursor. Current uses are fairly mundane but I've wanted a programmable editor with multi cursor ever since I read the MIT whitepapers on generalized cursors a couple years ago. You can do really neat things with generalized multicursor but not worth writing my own editor. In current form, multiple cursors have a neat interaction with vim normal mode but I haven't figured out a solid set of techniques for generating multiple cursors where I want them without mouseclicks and without getting fouled up by visual mode.<p>- Saves state between quit/open.<p>- Anything in the JSON configuration format is immediately applied on save, which makes tweaking a lot more convenient.<p>Disadvantages:<p>- Vi mode flaws make me crazy. Off the top of my head:<p><pre><code>    - No ~ implemented\n    - % doesn't work correctly with edit operators and \n      crosses newlines when it searches\n    - % doesn't jump between start/end tags\n    - No [c-i]/[c-o]\n    - Text objects that cross lines seem to be getting \n      set to linewise for subsequent lines\n    - no ex commands, the lack of s// is particularly irritating\n    - Selections intersect with visual/command/insert mode in\n      fun and exciting ways. I'm not sure what the right \n      behavior is but I know I have a mode error almost every\n      time I wind up with a selection.\n    - Various commands helpfully (if you're in insert mode)\n      highlight text, see above\n    - No blockwise visual\n    - Intermittent off-by-one errors (e.g. I've gotten \n      'for<Esc>..' -> 'fofofor' but now can't replicate)\n</code></pre>\n- Hand editing JSON for configuration sucks.<p>- Editing XML plists for syntax, snippets, and color schemes sucks more. And they don't autoload.<p>- Does not mantain cursor position across file close/open.<p>- No \zs \ze in regex engine. You can accomplish the same thing with more typing but I miss them.<p>- Not already installed on every posix environment, can't use over ssh<p>- Docs are comparatively poor and are on web instead of editor local.<p>- Not a lot of stuff available for various languages/environments means writing your own.<p>The problems are annoying but minor/fixable while the advantages aren't going to be duplicated by Vim any time soon. All in all, despite it being closed source it's a much better platform for me to build on. In addition the base platform has quite a few features that I'd implemented as plugins and there are some neat plugins like a package manager and REPL, which aren't polished but neat.",1317611998

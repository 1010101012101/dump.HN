8975592,comment,8970887,8975429,0,0,TheNewAndy,,,"Right, and then they distributed it among the people so they all had enough.<p>People with property sold it. People without property didn&#x27;t sell it (because they didn&#x27;t have any to sell). The apostles took the money and gave it to those in need. It wasn&#x27;t a black hole of money where the apostles took it and used it to pay rent on a church building that people were encouraged to visit, the distribution was to people to meet their needs.<p>Without having been there, I imagine that the way this played out was that everyone gave everything they had, then the apostles worked out what the needs of everyone were, and then divided things up so everyone&#x27;s needs were met. If people tried to hold something back then this just makes the practical matter of dividing things up much harder (instead of being able to say &quot;each family gets N things plus M things per child&quot;, they need to take into account whether the family already has stuff and reduce N and M to compensate). Yes, the sin of Ananias and Sapphira was not that they made logistics difficult, but I do believe that what they wanted to be able to do was to just do a simple job of just distributing things fairly and transparently, and people holding things back made that impossible.<p>Giving money to a church makes a lot of sense, and is clearly biblical. Using that money wisely also makes lots of sense and is biblical. Churches that invest this money in expensive mixing desks or outrageous rent when there are people in their congregation who don&#x27;t even have a place to sleep are not making good use of the money they are being given.<p>My opinion is that if a church has a regular person in their congregation who is lacking food and shelter, and the church is collecting money from people to spend on things like sound desks and coffee machines, then that church is stealing. People who give money to a church are giving it with the expectation that it be used in a way which is in line with biblical principles, and to be spending it on luxuries for the affluent when there is such obvious need is unconscionable.",1422669597

I was lucky enough to marry a then student president of the professional students (Med, Vet, Opt, Dentist, Pharmacy, Law) and as part of her duties she sat on the athletic counsel.  Our tuition did not go to the coaches at all, the athletic dept was entirely self funded and donated the excess to the school itself.  They helped fund a library renovation while we were there, among other student oriented needs.<p>Also, because of the success of the football team they are able to fund (again without student money) all the other sports &quot;no one cares about&quot; eg men&#x27;s badminton or women&#x27;s olympic weight lifting or something...  The majority of THOSE student-athletes truly are students then athletes.<p>Take away the good football and the other things become harder or impossible to achieve.

The price of a solar roadway would be staggeringly higher than a regular one. (Currently, most of the cost of roads is labour, earthworks, concrete piling, steel structures, etc.).<p>But solar roadways are ridiculous for another reason - first, putting a solar panel under a thick layer of glass will lower its efficiency greatly - because the thickness of the glass will reduce light transmissibility through it, making the panel far less efficient than a regular one on a roof etc... Secondly, the glass is really slippery, and the only way to fix that is by texturing it or coating it in something, both which will reduce transmissibility even more. Next, if you&#x27;ve ever dropped an ice-cream on the road and the picked it up again, you&#x27;ll know that roads are ridiculously dirty. The dirt and grime will build up, just like regular roads, reducing the efficiency even more. Then, the cars driving over it will grind that dust into the glass, and any abarasive material will put tiny scratches in the panel - which over time will build up and again reduce efficiency further.<p>Dave Jones from the Electronics Engineering Video Blog (EEVBlog) did some calculations in one of his videos - assuming optimal efficiency. Even then, a panel would not make enough electricity to pay itself back (can&#x27;t remember the time period exactly - over 20 or 30 years?

First solar heating converted to wind energy, then wind to waves.  If you can capture the initial solar flux, you&#x27;re better off.  Wind is your second-best option, and where that&#x27;s locally high, the EROEI (energy returned on energy invested) is quite high.<p>Marine installations are notoriously high maintenance.  Water, salt, corrosion, marine life, snagging, navigations hazards, and other factors, all play a role.  Few man-made (or natural) materials survive well, and those which do tend not to play a big role in power generation.<p>Even tidal energy, with both more available power and greater concentration than wave energy, has at best limited potential.  As an example that may be relateable to HN, the energy avaiable from daily fluctuations in the San Francisco Bay, at the Golden Gate.  In 2006, EPRI (the Electric Power Research Institute) established that the Golden Gate has a tidal energy potential of 35.5 megawatts of total extractable average energy power (852 MWh/day, 310 GWh/year), of which 15 to 17 GWh might be practically exploitable at costs comparable with current wind and natural gas projects.<p>The total tidal energy represented at the gate is 237 MW (average). Capturing the entire amount would require blocking the Bay to any and all shipping traffic, or installing locks or other means to allow shipping in and out of the Bay. The total daily energy (5,688 MWh) <i>is still well below the 18,000 MWh consumed by San Francisco daily),</i> though it is a healthy fraction at 32%.<p>Note that that&#x27;s the power draw _of San Francisco alone_.  Not the greater Bay Area.<p>Yes, all that water flowing in and out of the bay daily and the &quot;immeasurable energy&quot; it represents?

The fact that this comes up in particular for sports communicates to me that there&#x27;s a different dynamic at play here.  Do we often see this conflict for things like soy? Ballet? Curling?  Sports in america seems to stand alone in that any deviance from the norm gets picked apart with a VERY fine toothed comb, perhaps as a factor of societal norms.

The sshd generates a token URL and then stores your fingerprint with that token.

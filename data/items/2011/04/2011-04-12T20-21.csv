For example, I started playing disc golf and I got on a forum and everyone said ""Start with a putter and nothing else."" Two years later I have what might be called a fairway driver(innova Gazelle) as my fastest disc in the bag. I can play against guys that are throwing discs 2x or even 3x faster than I am and I compete against them pretty well. My shots aren't as far, but they are better shaped and more accurate. I can also putt much better than them. If you start out how he did learning how to putt first and working backwards you will have a very solid game. Did you do this?<p>2 You need dedicated practice, not just any practice. The time you dick around with friends, try trick shots, go out and drink some beer don't count. Most people spend a large part of their 'practice' doing this. I was putting 1,000+ times a night to improve my putting game and that was deliberate, dedicated practice.<p>3.I would agree with you if you would have said, ""This guy has no history of sticking with anything."" The best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. It's going to take a lot to change his behavior and stick with it. But the fact that he hasn't touched a golf club isn't going to hold him back.<p>I believe this guy is adding significantly to the sport of golf, human behavior research, and just doing awesome experiments.

One of the benefits of NOLOH is it's lightweight and on-demand nature, that everyone in this thread, and in the blog post seems to be requesting, but without actually identifying it.<p>In the case of NOLOH, lightweight and on-demand means that the server sends the client only the necessary highly optimized client-side code for their application specific to the user's device at that current point in time, resulting in faster initial and continued loads. Similarly, as the user continues to use the application, NOLOH continues to send only the necessary and optimized code. This eliminates the fat-client problem, as the user only has what they absolutely need, specific to them. Similarly, in the case of search engine robots, NOLOH sends standards compliant semantically rich content, without the other baggage.<p>This is accomplished by implementing different renderers for each target device, so rather than use a general client-side library that loads everything it could possibly need for all browsers and situations, NOLOH has specific variations for each browser, version, and device. The ever growing number of browsers and devices demands this.<p>In ""Lightweight, On-demand, and Beyond"" in this past November's issue of php|architect,  <a href=""http://www.phparch.com/magazine/2010-2/november/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phparch.com/magazine/2010-2/november/</a> (sorry for the pay-wall, we'll repost it this month as the exclusivity period expires), we go in-depth explaining the next version of our lightweight and on-demand functionality, where we make it easier for us to maintain an ever growing number of target devices, while sending even better code to the client, without any drawbacks on either the client, or the server.<p>It's been very interesting reading all the posts regarding event-driven programming, fat-clients, and unnecessary bloat. I remember initially thinking about these issues in 2005 when Philip Ross and I first created NOLOH, we were young and naive at the time and like all good solutions, didn't have the status quo entrenched in our thinking. So when I read these posts and they have the same gist as our initial white-papers it saddens me that we haven't made as much progress as I thought we would've, it also makes me feel old.",1302641519

Post what <i>everyone</i> is making and let people negotiate a fair package. There would be some transitional pain in the first 2 months, and payroll costs might go up 10 percent, but people would be happier in the long run. Why use inaccurate gossip instead of full transparency?<p>What drove up compensation in banking in the 2000s was <i>inaccurate</i> compensation reporting. Pay in banking is one's status, so everyone would claim to have received top bonus when applying to private equity jobs or trying to make a lateral move. This meant that whatever bonus was paid to the top 5% of each year would be claimed by <i>everyone</i> in that year. That ratcheted up pay expectations over time. Banks actually liked this, because the high pay enabled them to make entry-level conditions and hours even worse, but most companies wouldn't be able to afford that process.<p>In the long run, I think that salary discovery by inaccurate gossip is more expensive and volatile than full transparency, and I can't think of a good reason why, in any company, everyone shouldn't have access to everyone else's base compensation (performance bonuses can be private; the range should be public but not the amount.)",1302641343

See:<p>""Men have been hit harder by this recession because they tend to work in fields like construction, manufacturing and trucking, which are disproportionately affected by bad economic conditions. Women cluster in more insulated occupations, such as teaching, health care and service industries.""  (comparing without demographic isolation)<p>""The Department of Labor's Time Use survey shows that full-time working women spend an average of 8.01 hours per day on the job, compared to 8.75 hours for full-time working men. One would expect that someone who works 9% more would also earn more. This one fact alone accounts for more than a third of the wage gap."" (comparing with demographic isolation, with no mention of wage differences between men with children and women with children)<p>Again, my point is that saying ""men and women make X money for Y jobs"" doesn't make much sense, and doesn't illustrate whether or not the wage gap is closed or not and more importantly, any subset of data can be compared with another subset of data to illustrate that it is or is not closed. The author here uses really simplistic arguments to make a case that isn't true.<p>The fact is, that if you leave out women with children and women who've only negotiated their salary once, then the wage gap doesn't look so bad. But throw in their first jobs and women with children, and it's significant.",1302639903

They get to pay for and watch a lot of commercials for this privilege. Meanwhile consumers who watch TV shows on Hulu can watch current episodes, and often previous ones they may have missed for free, with only a few minutes of commercials per episode. They have the option of paying(a lot less) for more previous episodes and even whole series. There will always be the people who don't want to/wont pay for anything.<p>To me it seems like the best deal for consumers is Hulu. If Cable networks focused more on making shows people really like to watch, plus things that require live viewing and also invested more into infrastructure to deliver content to consumers in more than one convenient way, everyone wins. The networks may even be able to get some of the people who generally only download content to use their legitimate channels of distribution if they make it easier.<p>On top of all of that, if they would offer this service in non US areas, the amount of eyes on their shows, ads and even people willing to pay would be enormous.",1302639902

I know I grew up with hand-me-down computers until late highschool.   through the first half of high school, I used a tandy model 100 TRS-80 laptop.   Really, if you wanted the thing to do anything besides just take notes, you'd have to program it yourself.<p>At another point I had a vic-20.   No disk drives;  if you wanted to play space invaders, you had to type it in to the basic interpretor.<p>The fact that modern computers are useful without programming, I think, is something of a disadvantage.   The fact that casual programming is discouraged on most smartphone platforms is an extreme disadvantage.   I remember doing most of the math homework I did on that model 100;  I'd write some basic program to do it for me, then type in the questions.   The iphone has several orders of magnitude more power than that trs-80 I lugged around, but just getting the goddamn program on an iphone would probably have presented a bar that was too high for me to bother with at the time.   The thing was, writing the program in basic was faster and easier than doing all the math problems by hand.   (the method I was taught involved a lot of extremely frustrating ""guess and check"")  If writing the program was more work than doing the problems by hand, I'd probably have done the problems by hand (or more likely, not done them at all.)<p>So yeah, I guess if by 'good dev environment' you mean 'easy dev environment' I agree.  But I really think the focus for smartphones needs to be on lowering the barrier to entry.<p>ROM BASIC was not a ""good"" dev environment, but god damn, it was easy.   Not only was it easy to learn, it was really, really easy to get booted in to, and easy to see the output of your program.  nearly every computer built came with it built in.  Often booting in to ROM BASIC was easier than booting the ""real"" operating system.",1302639755

For example I'm a business guy not a progammer, but I love to learn more about the non-business things. I genuinely can't judge the 'good or bad' on my own on some of this stuff. The karma gives me a quick and simple way of the community - this wonderful, intelligent community - pointing me in the right direction.<p>- It also shows where my comments might be off base - not because my comments karma is high or low (which I still see) but because I can see if the counter arguments are rated highly. For example I can't see if your comment is highly regarded or not. If was +40, compared to +1, I'd be more likely to think 'hmm, maybe I'm wrong on this after all'. Sometime is not just the power of the argument that changes minds, it's the weight behind it. I can't see that weight now.<p>-sometimes I quickly browse HN with some minutes of down time. Sometimes I read in depth. I now feel I'm being forced all the time to read in depth. Whilst that sounds good, in practise for me it isn't. Instead of more in depth reading I'm just cutting out the browsing, so I feel ultimately I'm getting less out of HN.",1302639307

These shows are all available for free in HD over the air. Why aren't cable companies blaming their diminishing subscriptions on this as well?<p>Cable is so incredibly overpriced that Hulu was almost a legal godsend of an alternative for many consumers, even the paid version. It's just how people watch TV. We watch shows. We watch 30/150 available channels. Occasionally we just watch ""what's on"". Cable companies realize this and though it is not necessarily costing them more to provide content, they're losing potential money from overpriced cable so now they're looking on hiking the prices of content available and soon Hulu will be just as expensive as cable and we'll have to resort to illegal watching until an alternative comes out again.",1302638518

2438951,comment,2438660,2438660,2,0,nuclearsandwich,,,"It seems really difficult to offer a compelling software engineering program. Computer Science has a lot of history and theory that is well suited to classrooms and professors. A software engineering program would have to be constantly (at least each semester) evolving to explore all paths for designing good software. In fact, we offer a Software Engineering degree at San Jose State University, in Silicon Valley, we should have an unfair advantage in that field. As a CS/Math major I am required to take a few SE courses. All of them have been 10-15 years dated in both execution and their definition of good software and what constitutes solid design. I'm so sick of these SE classes that I'm tempted to drop out or transfer. Engineering (not just software) is mastery of a craft, it isn't something you can learn by passing classes and getting a degree. You need to get your hands dirty, something other engineering disciplines focus on highly. For an SE program to be effective there should be one class: Software Engineering 1, the curriculum should consist of working with your peers to build awesome software. You should have to take it at least six times. The instructor can mentor the veterans and the veterans can mentor the freshmen The masterclass is to start a project that you spin up into a publicly available piece of software, then watch how you're design scales and what needs to change.

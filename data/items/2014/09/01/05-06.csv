Academic learning would surely be associated with high level and complex neuronal circuitry, which would not seem to be easily parsed into a few categorical formulations.<p>Saying someone is a &quot;visual learner&quot; is very likely a vast oversimplification.  Thorough neuropsychological evaluation can reveal dozens of specific cognitive abilities and show areas of strength and weakness.<p>Normally the &quot;peaks and valleys&quot; of abilities have modest difference, but there are individuals with great variation: for example, genius level (IQ 180) in some areas, while adjacent skills are just average (IQ 105).<p>Such &quot;unevenness&quot; can produce major difficulty with task performance in school and jobs, as markedly inconsistent abilities can hinder learning or productivity in ways hard to understand and rectify.<p>&quot;Learning style&quot; may be controversial because it is a hard to study, and assessing individuals is too complicated and expensive.  The pragmatic approach of using a variety of methods to teach a class of 30 kids is quite sensible.  A good teacher knows some students catch on better with one approach vs. another, but in any case, for the students who can learn from any approach the repetition would probably do no harm.",1409551135

Aditionally, there are no IDEs for Ada comparable to the IDEs of other comercial languages (e.g. C++, C# or Java).

If it had, things like Rust and Go may have been superfluous. But the way things are, I just don&#x27;t see it happening.

If you want to change, eg., libxml or something like that, lots of processes that you don&#x27;t know about might be effected, and all hell can break loose.<p>By contrast, I was generally nuking random userland processes, which no process (or user) would mourn or miss.

Its mission is presently projected through 2044.[1]  That&#x27;s a ninety-two year mission.<p>There were 744 built, unit costs range from $9.28 million (1962) to $53.4 million (1988).  The most recent new production was 1963, over a half century ago.  Effectively the planes are rebuilt periodically, though some original components may remain (I&#x27;m not fully up on my B-52 maintenance procedures and schedules).<p>&quot;Flyaway cost&quot;: $9.29m, in 1955 dollars, $82.53 in 2014 dollars)<p>Present maintenance costs: $10,406/hr.<p>That is equivalent to the purchase price of the aircraft every 8,000 flight hours.<p>AAA publishes a &quot;cost of ownership&quot; report for automobiles which assumes 15,000 miles of travel and an average of $0.05/mi maintenance, or $750/year.[2]  This suggests that a B-52 level of maintenance is at least twice the going cost of automobile maintenance.  But not <i>hugely</i> out of line given relative capital costs.<p>GlobalSecurity.org claims B-52 total service life being 32,500 - 37,500 flying hours.[3]  Over the 92 year life of the program, that corresponds to a duty cycle of roughly 4.6%, vs. 5.7% for the automobile referenced above.  It also gives us an annual maintenance cost per B-52 of $4.2 million -- or 5% of the total purchase cost.  Over the 92 year life of the aircraft, that&#x27;s equivalent to purchasing 4.7 new planes.<p>(Taken from a longer response to an allegation about failure to incorporate demand-side depreciation in GDP, largely deconstructed, demolished, and dismissed here.)<p>Also, incidentally, I dropped you an email concerning your &quot;Internet with a Human Face&quot; blog posting, seen that by chance?<p>______________________________<p>Notes:<p>1. <a href=""http://www.gizmag.com/b52-upgrade/20098/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gizmag.com/b52-upgrade/20098/</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.colorado.aaa.com/auto/fuel-guide/driving-costs-for-vehicle-types/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.colorado.aaa.com/auto/fuel-guide/driving-costs-fo...</a><p>3. <a href=""http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/systems/b-52-life.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/systems/b-52-life.htm</a>",1409550484

Lectures, even with visual aids, often are very difficult for me to sit and learn from: Notes aren&#x27;t generally enough, but I can doodle and take lighter notes retaining more  (teachers in school didn&#x27;t like this all that much). I generally liked writing research papers because I could work with the concepts and things I had read on paper: Working with the words and editing and things like that tended to make a better understanding of the subject. I do this for fun at times - for example, I&#x27;ve been studying Chaos Magick and wound up answering my own questions in writing so i could try understanding (and passed that onto someone with actual knowledge to correct me if I am wrong). Foreign language is all about use and the right input - pronunciation takes me a while to catch, but it is easier if I can hear the word while seeing it written (lots of times), which allows me to better understand syllables and figure out the patterns, with occasional explanations of what the mouth is doing. Seeing + hearing + use. Visual cues I can project or imagine them in front of me, and mentally manipulate it. Sure, the details differ from the real thing, but it still helps.<p>I used to think I was a visual learner as well - until I realized it was the doodling/notetaking movement that got me to pay attention more than the notes themselves, though I kept up the notetaking habit to a point because it proved useful to refresh my mind later on.<p>And sometimes I think I just have to make sure to not be bored while learning - note taking or drawing could just let my mind focus on words. In addition, science has debunked this a few times (sorry for not having links) - which makes me wonder if it isn&#x27;t more akin to horoscopes... if you think you are a visual learner, it is easy to notice things you&#x27;ve learned well visually and also pick out things that went wrongly that were non-visual: Decide you are something else, and you might see the same pattern - a brain trick more than anything.",1409549924

Disable root login (namely, a non-root user must login via a key, then su or sudo to root)<p>4. Lock down everything with IPTables<p>5. Allow only encrypted connections to the few ports open via IPTables (normal exception is port 80 for http).<p>6. Segment the network (with DO private networking your machines are open to anyone within the same facility, so you need to isolate your private network from other DO customers)<p>7. Lock down each running service/daemon per it&#x27;s standard configuration. For example, if you&#x27;re running Postgres, then lock it down per pg best practices.<p>8. Create individual, non-privileged users for each service that you&#x27;re starting. ex. If you&#x27;re running an app server, then it should have its own user.<p>9. Sandbox everything that can be.<p>10. Turn off everything that is not being used, then uninstall it.<p>11. If you don&#x27;t need them, then uninstall build tools such as compilers. Have a separate build machine.<p>12. Only open edge of network machines to the outside world. On DO, turn off eth0 on all machines that customers do not directly interact with.<p>13. All services that are internal user only should have public networking totally disabled. Ex. Redis should only run on a private IP, should have the public interface disabled, and should only be accessible via a secure connection (ideally with some type of true authentication, replay protection, etc. Or, just run these services on a trusted network and pray that nobody penetrates your network deep enough to find out that you&#x27;re totally unprotected once inside your network.<p>14. Don&#x27;t keep private keys/certs in places that they are not needed.<p>15. Have a map of each service, the user that it runs under, what resources that user has access to, and a general map of what sequence someone has to follow to control your network. If you catch someone mid-attack, you can start to lock off parts of your network.<p>16. Logging! And monitor them for attacks. And ship logs off the machine in question so that you can review logs even if a machine is compromised.<p>There&#x27;s lots more, but this is a basic list that should be configured via Ansible/Chef/Puppet/Salt for each box.<p>One other item I&#x27;ve heard is that some people like to run heterogeneous networks.",1409548995

In most markets, blackouts are rare, but when they do happen, it&#x27;s nothing more than a disgraceful power play and a relic of rules that were devised 40 years ago. The real crime is publicly financed stadiums.<p>The tax-payer funded stadiums racket is usually driven by teams explicitly or implicitly threatening to move - the oldest and most effective trick in the book. A recent example was the half a billion dollars the Minnesota legislature coughed up to the keep the Vikings from (probably) leaving for L.A. Remember that the most popular and profitable American sports league <i>doesn&#x27;t even have a team</i> in the second largest market (even though it used to have 2) and realize that the NFL will continue to be able to hold cities hostage under threat of relocation.<p>Even the New York Yankees have tried it ( <a href=""http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/sports/features/2860/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/sports/features/2860/</a> ) and ended up with over $200 million of public financing for New Yankees stadium if I remember correctly. Almost as if someone actually believed that they might become the New Jersey Yankees??<p>The most egregious recent example is the New Braves Stadium in Cobb county that was subsidized with around $300 million of taxpayer dollars by &quot;tea-party conservative&quot; Cobb county officials. All of this for a stadium that isn&#x27;t even 20 years old...in a county that had to lay off around 200 teachers and furlough the rest.<p>Not a bad business, if you&#x27;re an owner in a North American sports league. The NHL is a different story for most markets, but owning an NFL or MLB team is unquestionably a license to print money. NBA owners love to plead poverty when the CBA is up, but the goddamn Milwaukee Bucks sold for over a half a billion and the wait line to buy an NBA is longer than ever.",1409548759

Maps are only a tiny part of most people’s lives. They’re exposed to many projections anyway—as they should be. They take cues from a map in many ways, not just relative sizes. And mostly, they really don’t care.&quot;<p>Well, personally, I&#x27;ve never been exposed to other projections until 28 years of age and that was only because I happened upon an article about how wrong mercator projection is on Hacker News.<p>While it really is a tiny part of my life and I don&#x27;t really care, the realization that Africa is huge and almost three times bigger then Europe and that Greenland is tiny is something I consider an important thing to know - and probably changes some of my views on things (for instance I never quite understood how Africa has so many countries - which if you triple it&#x27;s size, it becomes much clearer).",1433019568

The traditional visual signalling system tends to change exactly at the border, but you may find pre-signals just inside the other country. The in-cabin signalling and automatic train protection may or may not change at the same location. Changeover of the electrical system is more elaborate, and can take place at the border, a few kilometers inside one of the countries, or at one of the larger stations on either side, in which case you will find switchable tracks at that station.<p>There are different allowed widths and heights (&quot;loading gauge&quot;) for train cars in different countries. Finally, few people know that the overhead lines veer a little bit to the left and right to spread the wear on the pantographs. The extent to which this happens also differs between countries, and some countries have narrower pantographs than others, which means that trains cannot just ride both in Germany and Switzerland even though they have the same electrical system.",1433019343

As someone who writes Haskell at his job, I find that baffling.<p>Why would I want to try out Haskell for the reasons shown in the lecture? Convince me with business prospects - not by showing people code they will not understand in 10 minutes unless they already do.<p>The thing is - there are _tons_ of good examples of using functional programming and Haskell concepts in Swift, using monads in async programming (ala promisekit) or using monads for JSON parsing to get nice syntax are both very real use cases that could save developers lots of time.<p>One last thing - my Haskell code compiles _a lot_ more than it works, saying &quot;if it compiles it works&quot; is one of the most damaging things people say about Haskell. Having a strong type system does not mean your code somehow doesn&#x27;t have the hardest class of bugs. Not to mention it&#x27;s all nice and dandy that it will let you pass stuff around - but when you implement an algebraic structure (like a Monad or a Monoid or whatever) <i>you</i> are the one in charge of making sure it abides to all the laws of that structure - this is fine but it would be awesome if people said that when they show you what monads are, the compiler helps verify your code with your help by you spending time proving assertions about your structures - not magically.<p>I love Haskell, and I think it taught me a lot about Swift, being able to do things like `Either` in Swift because it has strong enums is awesome (product types ftw). Can we please show people what actually works from Haskell instead of just saying monads and then giggling about it?<p>I&#x27;m sorry for the negative comment - it clearly looks like the author of the talk did a good job preparing it and he&#x27;s a good speaker - I just think focusing on what he did does a disservice to Haskell and functional programming.",1433018531

Moreover, many other online mapping services have adopted the same projection.<p>Students (or whoever else) who might have previously gone to look up a region of the world on a globe, large paper map, or atlas are now turning to sites like Google Maps instead. The market for high quality paper maps has fallen quite a bit as more convenient online maps become the go-to source for answering all sorts of geographic questions.<p>Moreover, Mercator maps are turning up as the basis for many other tools. For instance, several online map collections have started georeferencing and reprojecting historical maps onto a Mercator projection, saving them as raster tiles, and allowing visitors to pan and zoom around on those reprojected maps, Google-Maps style. Instead of looking at various original maps with region-specific projections, now the viewer is getting more and more exposure to just Mercator maps.<p>If you look around the web, there are many examples of good maps with reasonable projections, but there are also many many examples of people using the Mercator projection in wholly inappropriate contexts. For example, I see Mercator choropleths of US statistical data quite frequently, which should be using something like an Albers equal-area conic projection instead.

Fluency in Esperanto or Lojban, for example, can be attained in as little as one year.<p>* Thus to learn, say, Swedish, it&#x27;s fastest to learn Lojban first in one year, and then Swedish is a subsequent acquired language and only takes an additional two years.<p>* Conclusion: It&#x27;s faster to learn &quot;(Esperanto|Lojban) Swedish&quot; than it is to learn Swedish alone.<p>I don&#x27;t entirely subscribe to this theory, but it&#x27;s an interesting speculation.<p>For me, I learned some constructed languages because I wondered if they would provoke the Sapir-Whorf effect.

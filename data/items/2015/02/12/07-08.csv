It is apparent that the steel used for the hull was not suited for service at low temperatures. The seawater temperature at the time of the collision was -2°C.</i>[1]<p>Ductile-brittle transition wasn&#x27;t understood at all in 1912. Mass production of steel only goes back to 1886 or so. Before that, good steel was an exotic, expensive material, like titanium is today.  The first scientific work on ductile-brittle transition is from the 1920s, years after the Titanic. The Charpy test for brittleness was developed in 1900, but this was before refrigeration, so running a Charpy test on chilled metal was tough unless you were in an very cold climate.  One early metallurgist spent a year in a very cold climate to do just such research.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/jom/9801/felkins-9801.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/jom/9801/felkins-9801.html</a>",1423727846

But is it really fair to extrapolate that 10% ownership for $1mil means the whole thing is worth $10mil, given the significantly different provisions (ratcheted anti-dilution, pro rata/drag along rights, information rights, liquidation preference) their shares tend to have over common?<p>Maybe the SV convention of treating all shares as equal when talking about valuations should be examined more closely.",1423727816

After doing TONS of review on other graphite front ends and not being satisfied with the usability and flexibility of any of them I was close to giving up and was considering building my own solution.  Then Grafana appeared from the mist.  It has come a long way but from day one it was very functional.  I use the templating system inherited from Kibana(which Grafana was original based on) to great effect.  It allows me to create drill down and overview dashboards to zoom in on particular sites, clusters, or servers.  Integrating is a snap by linking in with query parameters from other tools which get fed into the template system.  I actually can&#x27;t imagine a time without Grafana and would encourage anyone using graphite(or one of the supported backends like influxDB) to give it a spin.",1423727316

The connection between the outside world and the premises will always be outside the \nscope of any type system.&quot;<p>Which is precisely why I enjoy types: Self referential consistency makes sure I do not make errors within the logical model I have set for myself. It does not help me build better models but once those models are built it helps me to compose programs that do not break the invariants in the chosen formalism.<p>Which, I think tells exactly what static types are good for: For those sort of problems that benefit from having a formal specification. There are a lot of programs that have this quality.<p>So the argumentation is a bit skewed off. It should not be about whether static or dynamic types are better but more focus on what are those identifiable problem patterns where a dynamic type system helps programmer create more value than a static one and vice versa.",1423726988

A lot of folks are fairly restrictive in the categories of people they interact with - I know several people who can only deal with very intellectual sorts, for example. E.g., they&#x27;d never date an anti-intellectual type (religious, feminist, etc), an unintellectual woman who seeks to enjoy life, a woman of a different socioeconomic background or even a woman at a different stage of life.<p>I don&#x27;t view things so restrictively so I can enjoy the company of all sorts of people.

However, this isn&#x27;t the set you&#x27;re choosing from when playing the Powerball. You&#x27;re rightly accounting for this. However, you&#x27;re accounting for this incorrectly by adjusting the size of the bankroll (&quot;Oh well, if you are a centimillionare you can buy a ticket and be rational.&quot;). Your bankroll is fixed. The correct adjustment is to change the set of values from which the fraction of the bankroll can be chosen.<p>The optimal bet for a +EV bet is always positive when the set of possible bets includes positive numbers, because a zero bet has effectively a zero EV. My intuition is that you want the number in the set of possible bets that is closest to the Kelly Criterion number when weighted along some curve (I&#x27;m too lazy to calculate which curve on my mobile device). If this is correct (I haven&#x27;t proved my &quot;closest on a curve&quot; idea) then the optimal bet is to buy a $2 Powerball ticket (the smallest positive bet).<p>That said both these ideas assume an infinite number of future bets following the same strategy, with no other games to play. If you play the Powerball every time the EV is positive, this is like an investment that will yield a return, on average, long after you are dead. And there are alternate games (the stock market, education, job searching) which yield more consistently and possibly with a higher EV.<p>Finally, the goal isn&#x27;t to maximize your bankroll. I just spent the cost of a Powerball ticket on a coffee, which has a -EV, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my decision.",1423726033

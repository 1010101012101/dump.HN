10236336,comment,10232505,10235085,0,0,rqebmm,,,">In the second half of The Problem of Political Authority, I consider how an anarchist society might work, specifically, an “anarcho-capitalist” society. In this society, the services now provided by governmental police would instead be provided by competing protection agencies, hired either by individuals or by associations of property owners. Protection agencies, knowing that violence is the most expensive way of resolving disputes, would require their customers to seek peaceful resolutions of any disputes with other individuals. Agencies would decline to protect those who either willfully initiated conflicts with others or refused to seek peaceful resolutions; any agencies that acted otherwise would find themselves unable to compete in the marketplace due to the soaring costs created by their troublesome clients. The services presently provided by government courts would instead be provided by private arbitrators, hired by individuals who had disputes with one another. Laws, rather than being made by a legislature, would be made by the arbitrators<p>So we&#x27;ll have &quot;protection agencies&quot; who have military arms and logistics arms to manage the necessary affairs of the agency. Those agencies will somehow provide equipment to their military, or else they&#x27;ll be inferior to the other agencies, meaning they will not be giving protection free of charge, instead they will run capitalist markets within their domain and somehow extract a profit (either by taxing transactions, or charging individuals). How exactly is that different from the current nation-state paradigm?",1442527149

The two of them are to some extent mutually exclusive: once you exit, you are no longer building a long-standing business.  (There are some exceptions where a company is acquired and then continues growing under the acquirer, like YouTube, Instagram, Twitch, and Reddit...and founders of the latter two happen to be YC partners.)  Which do you care more about?<p>For building a long-standing product or business, I would argue that Pinterest, AirBnB, 23andMe, GMail, and Yahoo Mail all qualify, as does YC itself.  That&#x27;s <i>why</i> they haven&#x27;t exited: Ben/Joe/Anne are all still building their businesses.<p>For exiting: PG/TLB/RTM (Viaweb), Kevin Hale (Wufoo), Justin Kan (Twitch), Michael Siebel (SocialCam), Paul Buchheit (FriendFeed) and Alexis Ohanian (Reddit) all exited for F-U amounts of money.  Sam Altman (Loopt), Dalton Caldwell (iMeem), Garry Tan (Posterous), Qasar Younis (Talkbin), and Geoff Ralston (Lala) may have, but it&#x27;s unclear from public documents whether the acquisitions of their companies resulted in a significant payoff to them after the liquidation preferences of their investors are taken into account.",1442527118

Here&#x27;s a transcript[0] from 2006 where he&#x27;s talking about it and says:<p>>For instance, the Tivo itself is the prototype of tivoisation. The Tivo contains a small GNU/Linux operating system, thus, several programs under the GNU GPL. And, as far as I know, the Tivo company does obey GPL version 2. They provide the users with source code and the users can then modify it and compile it and then install it in the Tivo. That&#x27;s where the trouble begins because the Tivo will not run modified versions, the Tivo contains hardware designed to detect that the software has been changed and shuts down. So, regardless of the details of your modification, your modified version will not run in your Tivo.<p>So while you may be correct that it&#x27;s never been litigated, it would seem that if the strongest software freedom advocates like RMS and the FSF thought that it did violate GPLv2, surely rather than telling people they should upgrade to V3 because it blocks tivoization [1], they would have just litigated against tivo and set the precedent.<p>[0] <a href=""http://fsfe.org/campaigns/gplv3/tokyo-rms-transcript#tivoisation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fsfe.org/campaigns/gplv3/tokyo-rms-transcript#tivoisa...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/licenses/rms-why-gplv3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/rms-why-gplv3.html</a>",1442526993

To claim there is nothing wrong with the US constitution (as the OP did) is to take a religiose view of it.<p>One other flaw I just put to wtbob below is that the way the document structures elections, the result is a two-party system that simply cannot adequately represent hundreds of millions of people of diverse backgrounds. Given that the document was raised explicitly in response to inadequate representation, that&#x27;s a problem. Is it the worst problem ever in a constitution? No, but it is still an issue.<p>Edit: For comparison, here in Australia we have a couple of major parties, a couple of big minor parties, and a scattering of small parties all in government at the moment. Or in Germany, it&#x27;s entirely normal for major parties to have to band together to form a majority in order to govern - from memory, Merkel&#x27;s party gets about 25% of the vote, and has to create a coalition with other parties to get the majority required. There is space in these systems for new parties to rise, and the concept of &quot;you&#x27;re either for us or against us&quot; is nowhere near as prevalent as in the US. These systems have their issues too, but they are more representative of their people due to their flexibility.",1442526907

It was possible to extract the keys from the manufacturers open source firmware packages. That made it possible for Criminals to abuse the certificates.<p>[short explanation of how the certs work for n00bs]<p>The mistake was find by bartvbl who informed the reporter of the problem. He had bought a D-Link DCS-5020L security camera and wanted to download the firmware. D-Link makes the source from lots of firmware available under a GPL license. &quot;After looking through the files it turned out that the they contained the private keys which are used to sign the code&quot; reported bartbvl, &quot;It gets worse - some of the batch files contained the commands and passphrases that were needed [to sign the software&quot;.<p>The user was able to confirm that the key could be used by signing a file that wasn&#x27;t from D-Link. The certificate expired at the start of september, which means that the trick no longer works. Even now that the expiry date has passed, software which has been signed will still be seen as being valid. Windows only shows a certificate error after the certificates have been withdrawn. This withdrawal has already happened so this [bug/failure] cannot be abused.<p>Software security specialists Fox-IT confirm the findings. Yonathan Klijnsma, a researcher from the company: &quot;The certificate was indeed in one of the firmware packages, version 1.00b03, the source of which was released on 27-feb-2015. The cert was thus published before it expired, which is a big error&quot;. He [, Yonathan,] found four other certificates in the same folder.<p>D-Link have in the meantime released new versions of the firmware which do not contain the certificates. In a statement the company told us that they regularly update the firmware in order to &#x27;conform to the latest security and quality standards&#x27;. They emphasized that there is no question of [malicious] premeditation. &quot;D-Link [does everything to prevent development of backdoors, bla bla boilerplate PR speak, etc etc]&quot;. D-Link promised Tweakers that they will release a new firmware next week which contains further fixes for the security problems.",1442524655

(They also assume people are of pure and immutable ideology; someone either is 100% &#x27;conservative&#x27; or 100% &#x27;liberal&#x27; forever; they can&#x27;t have a mix of nuanced beliefs and can&#x27;t change.

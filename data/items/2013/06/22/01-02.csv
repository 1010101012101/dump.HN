The question @pedrocr posed was why would it be necessary for Tesla to begin working with third-party dealerships at scale - they could still continue building their own showroom floors and continuing direct sales through their own channels. If they continued their direct sales process, it would not be ironic, as you claim, since they&#x27;ll still be circumventing the dealership middleman.<p>Note: This has nothing to do with good/bad experiences.

Indeed if a president doesn&#x27;t defend\nthe Patriot Act, the NSA, etc. and there\nis another Boston bomber, then some people\nwill try to sell the charge that &quot;The president is\nsoft on terrorism.&quot;  So, a president will\nwant to defend the Patriot Act, etc. right up until\nthe Supreme Court strikes down the act.\nThen a president will say that he did all he\ncould to protect us against the bad guys, and the part of government soft on\nterrorism was the Supreme Court or just say\nthat the Supreme Court showed us what we have to\ndo to defend the Constitution.<p>A politician wants\nto avoid chances that\nopponents could say that the \npolitician was to blame.  \nGenerally politicians get\nan A+ in CYA.<p>Generally the hope that a politician\nwill be more responsible is \na well informed citizenry making\ntheir opinions heard.  That&#x27;s why\nhere on HN I&#x27;m putting out there\nthat my view is that we need to\nprotect the Constitution; the Patriot\nAct, etc. and the NSA have been trashing\nthe Constitution; it&#x27;s not worth\ntrashing the Constitution to catch\nBoston wackos with pressure cookers;\nso, let&#x27;s get the NSA, etc. back\nwithin the Constitution and\notherwise do what we can with\nBoston police, the FBI, etc.\nabout Boston wackos.  Indeed, the\nRussians told us that the Boston\nbombers were dangerous wackos,\nand still we didn&#x27;t do enough.<p>One more point is that so far\na few wacko Muslims have caused\nus to suffer over 4000 deaths \namong our soldiers, tens of\nthousands of serious casualties\namong our soldiers, blow\nballpark $3 trillion (net present\nvalue) of our money, and trash\nthe Constitution.

So it is in fact an established cultural norm in a non-trivial number of places. I would go as far to say its the majority in the western world, but that&#x27;s irrelevant to the discussion.<p>>If we are willing to discards the concerns of marginalized people<p>People who have psychological quirks regarding personal space are not marginalized people by any common definition of that word. People who absolutely do not want anyone breaching their personal space without express written consent yadda yadda usually have good ways to communicate this to the people around them. Perhaps they shouldn&#x27;t have to, but then perhaps the rest of the world shouldn&#x27;t have to alter their behavior on account of a very small percentage of people.<p>But anyways, this discussion has suddenly turned from a question of whether &quot;seduction&quot; techniques is morally reprehensible to whether we are morally obliged to collectively take into consideration the concerns of a very small minority of people. These are two vastly different questions. Under this new understanding of the issue, &quot;seduction&quot; techniques are by default morally neutral. The question becomes whether it is morally obligatory (rather than simply morally praiseworthy) to not use these techniques on the off chance that person will have an abnormal reaction to personal space being breached. This question is very much dependent on the probability of encountering a person who will sustain <i>actual harm</i> from this. I would wager that this probability is extremely low, and a few orders of magnitude lower in your typical social situations (bars, clubs, etc). It seems rather clear that constantly obsessing about this scenario is unnecessary.",1371866152

I think the writer, who received considerable criticism here on HN, really just dug his trench a little deeper with this.  The whole theme - and the fundamental us-vs-them tone of the article, as though packagers weren&#x27;t themselves developers (they very often are) - really intensifies a divide that the DevOps movement tries to resolve; moreover, the example of bundler, shrinkwrap et al simply demonstrates the unfortunate case of NIH that many developers have about packaging: they are, in an echo of Greenspun&#x27;s tenth rule, doomed to reinvent it.<p>The fact is that application publishers cannot be relied upon to maintain upstream currency of bundled components, and this is the motivation for disaggregation.  System administrators are always more interested in maintaining the integrity of their servers and reliability of their services - especially the security facets thereof - than in pandering to a developer who, experience tells us, has a decent chance of not being around in a year&#x27;s time.<p>The best integration I have yet seen of language-specific and OS-level packaging is in FreeBSD&#x27;s BSDPAN framework for Perl, where language-installed modules automatically appear in the package database so that their lifecycle can be properly managed.  That&#x27;s a much more constructive solution that actually tries to bridge the divide, and I would like to see more of it.",1371865992

Such an attacker can modify executables and DLLs, change environment variables like PATH, change configuration files, read any data your user account owns, email it to themselves, and so on.

You know, when things get kinda rough and you talk to people, they sort of pull back a little, as if you don't have as much to offer. They somehow know something's up...probably from a slew of very subtle nonverbal cues.<p>2. I've often felt that Facebook creates more loneliness because it encourages a sort of fake, communal happiness. People generally want to put their best foot forward since their thoughts are broadcast immediately to everyone. And if someone deviates from this often enough they're shunned. I really don't know what the solution is, other than to not use Facebook. It's almost like FB has a spiritual 'cost' associated with it.",1285340144

After a while, most languages begin to look similar.<p>But, if what you want to do is to learn about programming languages, the thing to do is to write one of your own. Language design is among the most difficult of human intellectual tasks because the language elements must be composable to create larger, more capacious elements.  A common error is to ""add a statement to do X"" rather than creating a conceptual framework that works with other language elements to allows X (and other things) to be performed.<p>A book worth reading on the design of language is Alexander Stephanov and Paul McJones, Elements of Programming.  A talk covering some of the material in this book is scheduled for the Stanford EE Computer Systems Colloquium for November 3rd (<a href=""http://ee380.stanford.edu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ee380.stanford.edu</a>).  The lecture is open to the public, webcast live, and archived for on-demand viewing.  Eventually it will be out on YouTube, iTunes, and elsewhere.<p>And while we are on the ideas of language design, you might want to look into some of the theories of natural language.  George Lakoff's ideas in cognitive linguistics seem to apply to programming languages as well. Language, in his view, is motivated by metaphor.<p>I also think anyone who is serious about programming languages needs to have programmed in several assembly languages and to have experimented with macro assemblers.  Macro assemblers provide a powerful tool for creating nonce programming languages at the assembly level.<p>I would also suggest that learning about optimizations would be of interest.  At some level, optimizations are about mapping programming language concepts onto real machines for efficient execution.  There is a dymaxion tension between programming languages and computer hardware with each influencing the other.  Today, the need to efficiently map programs onto multi-core machines has renewed interest in parallel programming languages.",1285339836

This is because they collect every version of every news story and show the latest instead of the ""best"" article.<p>Case-in-point is the top current sci/tech story ""Facebook Blames Outage On Database Failure"" by InformationWeek, which has a really misleading headline. It was not a database failure the way you and I would think of it; it was a config tool problem. Now many users are going to think a database was at fault, when it wasn't. The method of bringing the crappy headline up to the top is just bad, bad, bad, and I don't think that ranking by popularity would help, because the non-techs or uninformed might thumbs up such a story.<p>So, how could they improve it and resolve this issue?",1285338901

Since fraudsters could get hold of plastics, the person who created them was required to go to the plastics area (located in a vault with armed guards) and fill out a form for each plastic, including the name on the card and the purpose of the individual test plastic.

They'll associate it with your new layout and start hating it.<p>The roll-out of features and changes should be gradual and isolated from one another. Theme something different there, move that widget to the other side, change your navigation scheme, comments are now NoSQL, ok start moving stories to NoSQL, and finally this is our new front-page system of you following users with a customized My News.<p>If any of those individual pieces caused an issue, or there was too much backlash, it wouldn't be associated with the excellent work and effort you've placed into all the other parts of the new site. You get targeted feedback, can quickly squash bugs, and your user-base is now accustomed to what would otherwise be a jarring change. Instead you get Digg v4, with weeks of broken axle pages, entire parts of the site not working, huge features and functions of the old site just completely missing, and what I can imagine is an entire development staff running around like chickens with their heads cut off trying to figure out what part of their new system (or multiple parts) are the issue, and how to solve it.<p>Pains me to see them do so much right, yet still get so much terribly wrong.",1285337727

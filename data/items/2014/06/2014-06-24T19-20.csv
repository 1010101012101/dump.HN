As you may remember from the previous thread, we did change the Remember Me + phone number fields to be optional, in large part because of the feedback we got on HN.)<p>Each new payment method comes with its own constraints. We&#x27;ll always try to give our users as many options as possible while working within those constraints. The constraints with Alipay are particularly tight, and for now the only way we can satisfy them is through checkout.js - but over time, if we can relax that, we will. We&#x27;re definitely not moving to a model where Checkout is always the first or only way to integrate a new feature. For example, the two other alternative payment methods we have in beta right now are ACH and Bitcoin, neither of which are built into Checkout. We do hope to eventually support both of these in Checkout, of course, but in those cases, it was easiest to do the API first; in the Alipay case, it was by far the easiest thing to do Checkout first.",1403639789

The problem remains!<p>(It works if you use std::swap, I think because whatever type tmp resolves to happens to overload std::swap to do the right thing.)<p>So why is vector<bool> the &quot;real problem?&quot; It&#x27;s because its operator[] doesn&#x27;t return a bool&, but instead some type &quot;convertible to bool,&quot; that may do lots of other stuff too. But the standard is chock-full of language like that. For example, with iterators: `str.begin() != str.end()` Is that a bool? `str.begin()[2]`. Is that a char? The standard doesn&#x27;t require either. Care to roll the dice by assigning one to auto?<p>Type inference works well in other languages, but it is more dangerous in C++ due to the risk of implicit conversions. C++ does so much stuff for you under the hood that it can be quite hard to figure out what is really going on, and auto only makes that problem worse. Use with caution.",1403639626

But towards the original point, dismissing a solution to a problem because of the relevant campaigning, and not the relevant changes seems like a pretty poor argument. Additionally, you could also take my statement as meaning, &quot;if the campaigning isn&#x27;t succeeding, perhaps trying to change the message will help&quot;. Which, encouraging STEM for all children, would be a new message that would also likely increase the number of women in STEM (eventually). This is actually a pretty common shift in the &quot;women in STEM&quot; movements as of late.<p>As a counter argument: There has been lots of campaigning on fixing the problem of limited numbers of women in STEM, but relatively few changes to the media portrayal of women in STEM or education of children to fix the problem. Perhaps more importantly, a vast number of STEM fields are in high demand, and our education system seems to be poorly equipped at encouraging students (in general) to enter (any) STEM field. So perhaps we can hit two birds with one stone and change how we teach STEM to be a more integral part of school, like the original post suggested with a relatively provocative title.",1403639422

Before about 100 or so years ago, almost every serious scientist or mathematician was effectively a philosopher as well (hence the Ph in PhD). Aristotle was (and still is, albeit augmented with more modern interpretations) foundational to almost every scholastic curriculum. &quot;Philosophy&quot; literally means &quot;the study of knowledge&quot;, and for much of human history, it has been where big ideas came from.<p>Philosophy gave us many of the things we consider science: the scientific method is the direct result of many of the enlightenment philosophers&#x27; quest to determine &quot;what is real&quot; versus &quot;what is not real&quot;. Once you have an agreed upon, repeatable definition of a process to get to &quot;real&quot;, you can move on from there.<p>Once the total knowledge of our species began to expand toward the middle of the 19th century, it was no longer sufficient for a scholar to be a &quot;philosopher&quot;. You had to specialize in something. So philosophy became dominated by the left-over &quot;soft&quot; topics like ethics and personal philosophy, leaving many people working in &quot;hard&quot; disciplines to shun the label of &quot;philosopher&quot;.<p>Interestingly enough, the classification problem is still one of the most hotly debated problems in philosophy. How much of our classification comes from a truly singular concept versus linguistic commonality? I don&#x27;t have the answer, but we&#x27;ve been asking the question for a long time.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy#History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy#History</a>",1403639280

For instance, if FBI, CIA, or NSA had to clear a probable cause legal hurdle in order to place someone on the list, and if a judge, rather than the TSA, had to approve their placement, then the program might be constitutional. The proceedings might have to be secret, so the no fly list would function like some NSA programs that I know folks here are so fond of (note: sarcasm) - but at least it would involve the judiciary rather than giving the executive branch carte blanche to prohibit anyone it deems suspect from travelling.",1403639269

The Smalltalk-80 system is a highly productive programming environment but poses tough challenges for implementors: dynamic data typing, a high level instruction set, frequent and expensive procedure calls, and object-oriented storage management. SOAR compiles programs to a low level, efficient instruction set. Parallel tag checks permit high performance for the simple common cases and cause traps to software routines for the complex cases. Parallel register initialization and multiple on-chip register windows speed procedure calls. Sophisticated software techniques relieve the hardware of the burden of managing objects. We have initial evaluations of the effectiveness of the SOAR architecture by compiling and simulating benchmarks, and will prove SOAR&#x27;s feasibility by fabricating a 35,000-transistor SOAR chip. These early results suggest that a Reduced Instruction Set Computer can provide high performance in an exploratory programming environment.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=808182"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=808182</a>",1403639003

The 20 year old me wanted to install them, but was shut down by the old Hispanic foreman during the meeting. He had been growing grapes for 30+ years. When I asked him how he decided when to water he said... simple. See these weeds growing under the grapes? (it was a type of pigweed I believe) When they start to droop it&#x27;s time to water. Turns out, the grapes roots are deeper and the vines much larger than the weed, so this was in fact a free (and pretty accurate) tensiometer.<p>I love tech. And not to be a cynic, but I kind of doubt many serious &quot;farmers&quot; read this magazine. The old foreman maybe converted me to a degree of traditionalism.

Suppose one was able to figure out an individual plant&#x27;s water needs. I don&#x27;t know of any irrigation system that would let you meet it. The block, patch, field, whatever gets watered all together. Unless you send people to adjust individual emitters or something.

Consider this statement, which appears on page 9:<p><i>The vast majority of the incident reports considered,\nhowever, did not consistently and systematically document\ninformation in such an easily transcribable manner, instead\ncommunicating or expressing answers—if any at all—to the above questions in a textual narrative (often located at\nthe end of the incident report). It is, of course, relatively more difficult to generate a categorical variable from purely narrative text, and, in particular, one must decide how to deal with narratives that are silent or ambiguous with respect to one or more of the questions posed above.</i><p>Or, there is this statement, which appears on page 11:<p><i>By examining impact rates, it is possible to control for racial disparities in the underlying populations impacted by SWAT deployments. Rates are expressed in terms of individuals impacted by SWAT deployment per 100,000 individuals. In particular, to calculate the white, Black, or Latino SWAT impact rate in a given jurisdiction, the number of white, Black, or Latino individuals impacted by SWAT deployments is divided by the total white, Black, or Latino population in that jurisdiction; the corresponding ratio is then multiplied by 100,000 to obtain the impact rate per 100,000.</i><p>There is more information on the data that the ACLU collected starting on page 27. Consider this statement:<p><i>The ACLU filed public records requests with more than 255 law enforcement agencies during the course of this investigation. One hundred and fourteen of the agencies denied the ACLU’s request, either in full or in part.</i><p>They assess the quality of the data received as follows:<p><i>The records that were produced revealed an extremely\ntroubling trend: that data collecting and reporting in\nthe context of SWAT was at best sporadic and at worst\nvirtually nonexistent. Not a single law enforcement agency\nin this investigation provided records containing all of\nthe information that the ACLU believes is necessary to\nundertake a thorough examination of police militarization.\nSome agencies (e.g., Tupelo, Mississippi) provided\nrecords that were nearly totally lacking in important\ninformation. Others (e.g., Salt Lake City, Utah) provided\nrecords that were quite lengthy, though still incomplete\nand extremely difficult to analyze because of their lack of\norganization.</i><p>Or their conclusion:<p><i>This variation has two immediate results: (1) any analysis of the data will necessarily have to contend with a large number of unknowns (as demonstrated above) and (2) it makes\nsystematic, thorough, and uniform collection of SWAT\ndata, at any level of government, impossible.</i><p>The ACLU acknowledges the flaws in this report, both in the body and in their section on methodology. And, they provide some good reasons for these flaws.<p>On the topic of race, consider this 2008 table of incarceration rates for 100,000 in  Utah. (source: <a href=""http://kff.org/disparities-policy/state-indicator/incarceration-rate/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kff.org/disparities-policy/state-indicator/incarcerat...</a>):<p>All men: 428.0\nWhite: 347.7\nBlack: 2696.9\nHispanic: 664.6<p>There is roughly a 9x difference in incarceration rates (expressed per 100,000) in Utah in 2008. Now, the ACLU report gives numbers on three different cities in Utah.<p>In Ogden, black people are 39.55 times more likely to be impacted by SWAT actions than white people. In Unified, black people are 10.33 times more likely to be impacted. Meanwhile, in Salt Lake City, the number is 7.33 times.<p>Again, I&#x27;ll remind you of this statement, which can be found on pages 9 and 10:<p><i>It is important to note that the data analysis in the report does not seek to make statistical estimates about the larger universe of SWAT deployments nationwide. Rather, the analysis is descriptive in nature, providing a general picture of SWAT deployments for this small cross section of\notherwise randomly chosen law enforcement agencies—the\ninformation contained in the documents received is not\nused to make more general, broader statements about the\nuse and impact of SWAT nationwide.</i><p>It is difficult to criticize a report&#x27;s methodology when the authors acknowledge the shortcomings, explain why the shortcomings exist and try to express the data they receive in as diplomatic a matter as possible. Consider that this report is not meant to provide a statistical analysis on the state of SWAT in the United States. Rather, it is meant to &#x27;shine a bright light&#x27; (to use their term) on militarization that has occurred largely without any public oversight.",1403638607

The basic argument, so far as I understand it, is that there must exist certain &quot;structures in the brain&quot; that make all our understanding possible. Since these are brain structures they must be a priori (everyone is born with them). On the side of aesthetic senses he boils these down to space and time. From our sense of space it is possible for us to reason about geometry and therefore much more abstract forms of mathematics without having to have recourse to the &quot;outside&quot; world. So we can envision and prove new geometrical proofs and our internal brain structures for understanding space ground these proofs in a sort of sense certainty. To go to your example of 2 + 2 we can say that nowhere in these symbols is contained the meaning 4 - so no amount of analysis (dividing these symbols up, reducing them to more primitive symbols, etc) will get us to the equality - we have to perform some operation internally and that operation has to be grounded on something a priori - these would be our sense of space where we can envision two things and two more things and perform the count and arrive at 4 - all done outside of experience.<p>Now there are plenty of philosophers who came later who have tried instead - following in the shoes of Hume - to perform a materialist grounding of these faculties not in the brain but derived from sense experience itself - sense experience somehow constitutes the structures of the brain and changing external sense experiences can reshape or reconstitute these brain structures. For example, Gilles Deleuze seems to me to do something like this.",1403638190

It’s worth noting that, in some (but not all) cases, this is no longer an empirical question: for instance, the traditional Copenhagen interpretation of QM is empirically equivalent to the Everett &quot;many worlds&quot; interpretation of QM. So, if we can’t do an experiment to settle the issue, we need to resort to some other method, which is where philosophers of physics come in.&quot;",1403637990

This methodology, besides being grossly inadequate at the experimental goals as portrayed in the article, doesn&#x27;t add substantial evidence to the philosophical debate.

We also have a VLE that was designed to look pretty, but offers almost no functionality and has a UI that is tortuous to use and actually lengthens the time it takes to mark work and record results.<p>Every teacher I work with has a different way of operating. Some write assignments on the board and take in hard copies. Other&#x27;s use the official VLE. Some use email or shared network drives, and others Edmodo or whatever platform is flavour of the month.<p>Work is marked and fed back to students, and then inevitable placed in an Excel spreadsheet, exported as a CSV or transcribed into a paper mark book, only then to be then double entered into our MIS at a later date.<p>The system is a mess, and every new Edtech tool I see just adds to the confusion - another URL to remember, another username, password, interface. I wonder how many Edtech startups have founders that were actual teachers, or bring teachers on board at an early stage. Judging by the tools on offer, I would guess that it&#x27;s not many.<p>There are a couple of exceptions. EdX, I think, is an amazing platform, but even though it is OpenSource, it is well beyond the capabilities of most schools to set up an in-house platform. Codecademy seem to genuinely want to engage with teachers (in the UK at least) but where are the Codecademy startups for Geography or French or Science.<p>In my own teaching I find myself increasingly shunning new Edtech tools, and now barely bother clicking on the links I receive in my inbox every day. Until Edtech startups really engage with teachers, rather than just treating them as beta testers, I really don&#x27;t see anything in the future other than increasing fragmentation and frustration.",1403637874

(See various previous HN discussions about Stripe, particularly around the time the phone number/remember me changes came in.)<p>When there was always the alternative of using stripe.js (as also repeatedly mentioned in previous HN discussions) this wasn&#x27;t a huge deal, because anyone who wanted stability could just go the other path. I think some of the concerns before were more about how many of us didn&#x27;t realise that Stripe sees checkout.js as an ever-evolving test bed.<p>If that no longer applies then there is now a need to choose between instability with checkout.js and losing features with stripe.js. When I first joined this discussion today, I was happy at the idea of Stripe starting to support a broader range of payment options. As I&#x27;m reading more, my joy is turning to concern that checkout.js is becoming the preferred integration method with significant downsides for those who don&#x27;t comply.<p>I do understand that there may be good reasons for locking in your choice of payment UI. On the other hand, this is not the first time I&#x27;ve dealt with a payment service where you can&#x27;t cleanly integrate the whole process into your own brand/UX, and interrupting that flow rarely turns out happily for conversion rates or, sometimes, brand reputation.<p>With that in mind, if proper support isn&#x27;t available for Alipay, then some sort of alipay.js as you mentioned would certainly be welcome, particularly if it allows at least basic styling customisation to match the colour scheme and typography of the merchant&#x27;s site.",1403637854

It really is our entertainment, half of all television shows for children show men (boys) being innately superior in intelligence [1]. Even worse, there are no children&#x27;s shows with primary female genius characters (they are all male), and when they do show up as non-primary characters their intelligence is often overshadowed by their feminine attributes.<p>It&#x27;s even worse in teen TV, where the smart female characters are more often portrayed as being love interests for male characters over being smart.<p>And lets not even get into the rampant sexism in most mainstream video games (and their communities), even more important for software engineering and computer science since modding/making/playing video games seems to be a common factor for many male entrants, and relatively uncommon among female entrants to the field (at least in my recent but anecdotal experience).<p>This all leads to a situation where computers, engineering, science, and math are more often seen as male disciplines. We may have cleaned up a lot of blatant sexism, especially in modern workplaces, but our media is still teaching our children gender bias, often with a detrimental effect for both genders (for example decreasing college rates for males, how many male teen characters care about getting into college, have their shit together, etc).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.truechild.org/PageDisplay.asp?p1=6656"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.truechild.org/PageDisplay.asp?p1=6656</a>",1403636815

Going straight to the primary sources (Porter&#x27;s books) can be a bit daunting as they are big, dry, and academic and not exactly what you&#x27;d call &quot;page turners&quot;.

It&#x27;s not radically different from the Porterian approach in some ways, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s narrower in focus and simpler.  The big takeway is the idea (which <i>should</i> be obvious, but often isn&#x27;t) that &quot;you can&#x27;t be everything to everyone&quot;.  The authors push a model of choosing a market discipline to appeal to a certain type of customer, and making that discipline the core of your business.<p>8.  <i>The Machine That Changed The World</i>.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Machine-That-Changed-World-Revolutionizing/dp/0743299795/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1403636244&sr=1-1&keywords=the+machine+that+changed+the+world"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Machine-That-Changed-World-Revolutioni...</a>  Have you ever wondered what this &quot;lean&quot; stuff is all about?

7939764,comment,7939181,7939181,1,0,squozzer,,,"Some of the problem, as Locke1689 said, lies in how non-philosophers perceive philosophy. I&#x27;m betting most of the laity were exposed to philosophy through low-level survey courses where notions such as substrata and monads were thrown about. While interesting and entertaining, to the typical physics major, it seems akin to teaching chemistry using alchemy and cosmology using geocentrism.<p>Young physicists also seem unusually biased towards mathematical forms of expression, as opposed to &quot;mere&quot; human language.",1403636478

They knocked first, several times, loudly, and warned they would enter the house by force, before busting open the door. No grenades or guns were involved. That seems like the right kind of caution when violating a person&#x27;s home. Yes, sure, in a drug raid that leaves time for flushing things down the toilet, but to me that seems like a reasonable trade-off.",1403636447

I don&#x27;t think most of the serious researchers are convinced they&#x27;ll be THAT useful in the long run. I&#x27;d dig up the research papers, but I&#x27;m supposed to be working :) I recommend a quick glance over their latest issues.",1403636439

So Frege tries (and fails) to derive all mathematics from logic.  Later Bertrand Russell tries to derive mathematics from set theory.

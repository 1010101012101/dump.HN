As has been pointed out elsewhere, Richards is a very atypical benchmark and different implementation styles have very different performance characteristics.<p>In fact, PyPy wins ONLY on Richards by 1.2x and ONLY for a specific iteration count. But LuaJIT wins substantially on ALL OTHER BENCHMARKS where something is actually compiled (i.e. not regex stuff). Your paper clearly shows that in the appendix, but no matter what, you're still pointing out that one little result.<p>And, even worse, you're trying to draw conclusions from this outlier. I have absolutely no idea how you could possibly come to the conclusion that this makes PyPy more suitable for 'large scale' programs? And that LuaJIT is not? That's not just unscientific -- it's dishonest and disparaging.<p>Also, constantly repeating that 'hand-crafted JIT compilers' are somehow inferior to PyPy's overly complex approach is getting really old by now. LuaJIT runs on more architectures and more platforms than PyPy ever will. And it's vastly ahead in terms of optimizations. Now, please compare the timeframe all of this was implemented and the size of our teams. Ok, so what was the better deal, again?<p>And, no, the semantics of Lua and Python are not that far apart as you'd like everyone to believe. Dispatch is more complex in Python, but that can be taken care of in a central place in the code. Most library code can be written in terms of lower-level code. And so on. There are simple solutions for all of that. And none of that warrants a clumsy meta-tracing approach.<p></rant>",1353667345

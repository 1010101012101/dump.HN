9934233,comment,9929719,9931981,0,0,shard,,,"Take a look at the restaurant business. When you open a new restaurant, working from before opening to after closing every day is not atypical, even when you are selling something people want and have hired the right people. Going months without a day off is unsurprising. It may not be praiseworthy, but it&#x27;s not something to look down your nose at either. Its just solid, honest hard work that&#x27;s required to establish a restaurant from scratch. And if the restaurant is successful enough for the owner to try starting a branch, then the owner is going to have to split his time between the two, thereby expecting all the profit from the first restraunt while being at the new restaurant a majority of the time to get it running. Is that rent seeking, or free money for past work? Perhaps you think so, but I don&#x27;t agree, and likely most people would not agree either.",1437631199

A marginally lower price is not by itself enough to achieve market penetration. If it takes 5-10 minutes longer to get a ride on your platform (due to fewer drivers), I&#x27;m not going to use it—even if you are 20% cheaper (wiping out Uber&#x27;s entire margin).<p>2. You&#x27;re ignoring the pooling savings which come from being able to easily coordinate shared rides due to a huge installed rider base.<p>3. Uber can spend you into the ground. They have a massive war chest and continued huge revenue from their mature markets—enough to undercut you until you run out of oxygen.<p>The biggest flaw of these 3 is that I just don&#x27;t think price alone is sufficient to overcome network effects. If it were, the $100+ vouchers which I see also-ran competitors giving out would have made a dent in Uber&#x27;s market share.<p>Competing against Uber in even a single city would require hundreds of millions in capital to basically buy your entire network overnight, and once you succeed in that market you&#x27;ll enjoy less profitability than Uber does today.<p>There&#x27;s a reason that crappy marketplaces like Ebay and Craigslist are incredibly sticky—networks are overwhelming.<p>A monopolist doesn&#x27;t have to make its moat unbreachable, it just needs to be insufficiently profitable to overcome.<p>The only possible risk I see to Uber is from corrupt politicians.",1437630423

This is a series of tweets by <a href=""https://twitter.com/balajis"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/balajis</a><p>--<p>If you are using software to go after a legacy physical vertical, we are most excited if you do it &quot;full stack&quot; [0].<p>With @counsyl, we found that one cannot live by bioinformatics alone. So built a full clinical lab + software + national salesforce.<p>Here is a video of our robotic genome factory: Also: insurance coverage, clearances, clinical integration... [1]<p>The reason to do full stack is that it&#x27;s hard to replace just one layer of an outdated legacy stack. CAC & integration costs can kill.<p>For example, consider &quot;restaurant powered by technology&quot; vs &quot;tech for restaurants&quot;. With code, reinvent industry and make better margins.<p>You cannot automate something till you&#x27;ve done it manually many times. You cannot abstract an API till you&#x27;ve seen many specific examples.<p>Need to build a site of the scale of <a href=""http://Amazon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://Amazon.com</a>  - and encounter all the problems - before you could do <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aws.amazon.com</a> .<p>Reinventing agriculture? Build new kind of farm, w/ solar panels & self-driving tractors. Control all factors, show that code cuts costs.<p>More examples of full stack startups.. Education: [2], Autos: [3], Hospitality: [4]<p>By doing it end-to-end, you see things. First, sometimes a good reason beyond tradition (eg regulatory, logistical) for legacy practices.<p>Second, your control of adjacent layers may eliminate the initial problem you were trying to solve. Analogous to: [5]<p>Third, solving whole problem builds respect in your vertical. Now you can recruit best people. Their experience + your code = invincible.<p>Fourth, your margins improve nonlinearly once you control the full stack. Simply having all orders in DB from day one is transformative.<p>Remember: for many legacy cos, IT = cost center. They only adopted the code. You were born in it, moulded by it. [6]<p>&quot;Muni commissioned a $3 million audit..after two years..figured out where people were getting on the bus.&quot; [7]<p>A full stack technology-powered bus service (like @leaptransit, soon to relaunch) can dump that from database for $0 in <1 second.<p>First full stack entrant into a given vertical is formidably protean. Morph your product just by hitting keys. Ex: [8]<p>Why not more full stack startups? Perhaps #1: recruiting difficulty. Need experts in many different areas. Must know what you don&#x27;t know.<p>A good way to get around this: gain vocabulary. Find best cos in your vertical. Read bios of execs on LinkedIn. Google new terms. Repeat.<p>Now you know regulations/acronyms/terms like CPT, 510(k), KOL. Repeated mentions increase relevance; prioritize accordingly.<p>Email the best. Read blogs, get context. Now you know kung fu, or at least know you need to hire kung fu master. [9]<p>In near term, expect iconic full stack companies in areas like biomedicine (3DP/genomics/qself), finance (bitcoin), aviation (drones).<p>Uber/Lyft, Airbnb, Tesla just the start. Poetically: almost any vertical regulated by a TLA is ripe for an eventual full stack co IPO.<p>Under appreciated aspect: full stack company can manage compliance more easily once beyond early stage. Hit enter, dump DB, submit form.<p>An ideal full stack co has:\na) git/DVCS at the core\nb) domain experts\nc) domain monetization knowledge\nd) a burning reason to fix things<p>As @justinkan wrote recently [10], unit economics dominate physical businesses. So monetization usually starts early.<p>In re: funding, full stack startups can be more expensive than pure code. Best candidates often 2nd time founder with domain knowledge.<p>But are thinking hard on alt funding models, for both open source [11] & full stack cos [12].<p>With that said, b/c VC = power law [13], full stack startups arguably easier to fund b/c easier to envision 1B+.<p>Finally, the best full stack founders have ambition to think big and the pragmatism to start as small as possible (but no smaller).<p>1B+ lifetime funding doesn&#x27;t phase us. 1B+ up front usually a bad sign. Careful staging + thought on monetization = pragmatic ambition.<p>To sum up: @cdixon & I love full stack cos. If you&#x27;re a founder w/ company built on git +  TLA knowledge + pragmatic ambition, do ping.<p>By request, some specific examples of full stack startup ideas in a few verticals: law, medicine, architecture, restaurants, accounting.<p>Full stack law firm: template all contracts, law APIs as core [14], [15], hyperdeflate legal costs.<p>Full stack clinic: mobile EMR/EHR, qself, genomics, telemed. Employ MDs w/ tech skills. Accept insurance, prefer cash subscriptions.<p>Full stack architect: put @vannevartech APIs at core of new construction co. Start with unmanned buildings like datacenters to derisk.<p>Full stack architect: Ultimate goal = hit enter to build a building w/ drones [16] + prefab [17].<p>Full stack accounting firm: Given bank account, auto prepare it all: tax to diligence to S-1 w/ legal sign off. (@xero could do this).<p>Full stack restaurant: Mobile order/pay/reserve, A/B tested dynamic menus w/ supply chain integration, robot prep: [18]<p>If goal is full stack, always talk to execs in field early on. Few words can save years of work, identify key cost centers & hard parts.<p>Note: can start all of these as &quot;just&quot; a new clinic/restaurant/accountant/architect/law firm. Think big, start small. Prove, then scale.<p>[0] <a href=""http://cdixon.org/2014/03/15/full-stack-startups/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdixon.org/2014/03/15/full-stack-startups/</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/video/521121/innovators-under-35-balaji-srinivasan-cofounder-counsyl/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.technologyreview.com/video/521121/innovators-unde...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/18/former-googlers-altschool-raises-33m-from-founders-fund-and-a16z-to-reimagine-primary-education/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/18/former-googlers-altschool-r...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jimgorzelany/2014/02/27/why-teslas-vertical-manufacturing-move-is-manifest-destiny/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/jimgorzelany/2014/02/27/why-tesl...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/3027107/punk-meet-rock-airbnb-brian-chesky-chip-conley"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fastcompany.com/3027107/punk-meet-rock-airbnb-bri...</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescoping_series"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescoping_series</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F157geaXp_w"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F157geaXp_w</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://www.sfweekly.com/2010-04-14/news/the-muni-death-spiral/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sfweekly.com/2010-04-14/news/the-muni-death-spira...</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2014/02/teslas-air-fix-best-example-yet-internet-things"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2014/02/teslas-air-fix-best-example-yet...</a><p>[9] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vMO3XmNXe4&feature=youtu.be"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vMO3XmNXe4&feature=youtu.be</a><p>[10] <a href=""http://justinkan.com/exec-errands-post-mortem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://justinkan.com/exec-errands-post-mortem</a><p>[11] <a href=""http://startupboy.com/2014/03/09/the-bitcoin-model-for-crowdfunding/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://startupboy.com/2014/03/09/the-bitcoin-model-for-crowd...</a><p>[12] <a href=""http://jerzygangi.com/why-silicon-valley-funds-instagrams-not-hyperloops/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jerzygangi.com/why-silicon-valley-funds-instagrams-no...</a> (404)<p>[13] <a href=""http://blakemasters.com/post/21869934240/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-7-notes-essay"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blakemasters.com/post/21869934240/peter-thiels-cs183-...</a><p>[14] <a href=""http://blog.csdisco.com/2013/05/01/the-future-of-legal-technology-flt-introduction/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.csdisco.com/2013/05/01/the-future-of-legal-techn...</a><p>[15] <a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contract"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contract</a><p>[16] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W18Z3UnnS_0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W18Z3UnnS_0</a><p>[17] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hdpf-MQM9vY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hdpf-MQM9vY</a><p>[18] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0GKIQdpscg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0GKIQdpscg</a>",1437630080

Quite often an ice lolly.<p>Too much info?<p>Actually that reminds me of a funny time - I was reading a book in the bath, while eating a ""mars ice cream"" - chocolate covered ice cream. Took a bite, and the thing cracked all over the place, fell in the bath. Melted chocolate everywhere.

365561,comment,365384,365554,0,0,LPTS,,,"Are you aware of all the research on when exactly humans will change channels, which describes human behavior exactly as if humans were ants?  The TV executives are.<p>Or do you think you're some special little butterfly whose behavior is not predictable in the exact same way everyone else has predictable scientifically validated patterns of responding to TV.  ""Select Channel"" does not function neurologically the same way youtube does.  TV execs have mountains of private data on that.<p>The difference is the activation in reasoning centers in the brain.  When you watch TV, your reasoning center shuts off (and thus does not guide your remote control usage).  When you use the internet to watch youtube, your reasoning center stays on.<p>You seem to believe people have free will and aren't walking around completely hypnotized behaving in almost completely predictable ways.",1226785478

365545,comment,365331,365331,0,0,ghshephard,,,"I've been hiring in the valley for the last 12 years, starting off in the interview chain at Netscape in '96, and moving into management at my current organization in 2003.  Since I moved into management, and end each interview chain (with a candidate that I am the hiring manager for, and have a candidate that I think we will bring on board), I have always ended the interview with three questions:  Do we have your application filled out, When can you start, and ""what did you make at your last company.""<p>""What did you make at your last company"" is a valid question, and I know of no employer (at a Silicon Valley Company) that has instructed their employees to _not_ tell future employers what they make.  It is, of course, considered good taste not to discuss compensation (Stock or Salary) with coworkers - but it's remarkable that there aren't typically company policies against that.  (There are exceptions, I'm sure)<p>The thing is - you _need_ to color that answer.  Don't just say ""I made $150K/year as a Sysadmin at my prior company"", it's fine to say ""They were paying me $150K, but that was probably an outlier, and I'd be very comfortable making $115K.""  Or, ""I was making $90K/year, but I'm looking to make $115K at my next engagement"" - You probably know (through salary.com, your colleagues at other companies, etc..) what the market will pay for your skills - and that is the number you need to communicate during the interview, what you are _worth_.  It is as destructive and harmful to a career to be paid more than you are worth, than it is to be paid less than you are worth.<p>The employees being overpaid are always the very first ones to be laid off, while their less skilled, but more appropriately compensated colleagues, are kept on.  And, when you aren't being laid off, if you aren't delivering to your compensation level - you are never receiving positive performance reviews - even if you are performing at a much higher level than someone less well compensated - makes for a stressful work environment.  (There is more to a job than money.)<p>Speaking only for myself, any candidate who starts going down the road of ""I won't fill out employment application until we are interested in each other"", ""I won't discuss previous salary"", ""I won't provide references until there is an offer letter"", etc... - just screams ""Prima Donna""<p>That strategy might work if you are a very strategic hire, with very specialized skills, in a very tight job market - but in general, life is too short to have to manage those type of personalities, and I'd rather just take a pass and bring on someone who is willing to work _with_ me, and not _against_ me.",1226784630

While it might not be true for everyone who refuses to disclose salary, it's true for a large enough percentage of applicants that it's safe to assume.",1226784389

I would make the same argument recent RIAA cases, SCO v. IBM, etc.  I recognize that there's legal posturing going on here, and that strictly from the lawyers' perspective, public opinion may be nearly irrelevant (in mundane corporate law, anyway).<p>But the visibility and transparency of these cases has changed.  Vast groups of people can follow these cases in minute detail, get the advice and perspective of interested lawyers, even change the course of the cases themselves (Groklaw).  I can't imagine this kind of public involvement with corporate legal cases existed twenty years ago.<p>My question is this: has the Internet made the position of ""suing everyone"" -- at least as an opening move -- too risky?",1226783739

Interesting.<p>The article had my internal monologue going ""ok, where would be better, what move could I make to avoid the fallout from this?"" and it occurred to me that there's probably not going to be any industry that makes it out of this unscathed.<p>I suppose it's a good reminder that as an individual you should invest in high risk things in good times but also have a sound strategy for minimizing your risks in the event of serious economic troubles.

WTF?)""), which is weird, because vertical scollbars rarely, if ever, appear on the left).  Then I realized that, since the scribd flash widget takes up the entire screen, the Ad Block Plus firefox plugin was adding its little ""block"" icon/tab, which was really making the widget larger than the size of the browser viewport.  So there was the scrollbar created by the scribd interface, and the browser's scrollbar.  Disabling Ad Block for scribd.com appears to have ""fixed"" this.",1226783137

development locally, then use rebase to clean it (the local changes)
up before pushing it out to a central repository (or merging it into
master). If you're really paranoid that someone will use rebase to screw up master, you can use a tool like gitosis or gitolite to manage permissions on a central repository. You can say that no one has permissions to push things to master that are not fast-forwards.<p>Scenario #1:<p><pre><code>  I'm working on a feature branch. I have a number of discrete changes
  that I'm making. I attempt to keep each of these changes in its own
  separate commit. After completing 10 such changes, I realize that I
  introduced a bug in change 3. I commit the bugfix with the same
  commit message title as change 3, but with a ""squash!"" prefixed at
  the front of it. Now when I'm finished with my changes on the
  feature branch I can run ""git rebase -i"". git-rebase will
  automatically position the bugfix to change 3 next to change 3 and
  set it up to be squashed into the change 3 commit. Then when I merge
  my changes into master there are only commits for changes 1-12,
  instead of 50 commits covering all of the minor bugs that I fixed
  with my undeployed code.

Scenario #2:<p><pre><code>  Rewriting commit messages. This is one that I use all of the time at

  the bottom. When I do all of be topic branch development, I don't
  get someone to review each individual commit prior to commiting it
  (as that would defeat the purpose of a DVCS... might as well go back
  to SVN at that point and managing chunks of changes prior to commits
  with something like `quilt`). So now all of my commit messages have
  ""Reviewed-by: ???"" on them. Prior to merging the changes back into

    can deploy networked/armed decentralized
    P2P microweapons with explosive, chemical,

P.S.:  my wife, a psychologist, hates Chomsky.  As she puts it, he savaged Skinner's behaviorist approach to psychology.  When Skinner didn't refute Chomsky's objections to the behaviorist approach because he was sure nobody took Chomsky seriously, Chomsky and his cohort took it as an admission of defeat.",1304850350

2525625,comment,2524631,2524860,1,0,fryguy,,,"Why are ""alternative currencies"" illegal under US law? AFAIK the only thing that's illegal is refusing to accept US$ as payment if you accept something else. For example, people can spend foreign money (GBP, Euros, etc) inside the non-international parts of airports. Also, people can transfer their USD to foreign currency and vice versa over the internet and at banks. Is there something different about bitcoin than say zimbabwe dollars? If anything, they're probably safer. As an aside, USD are accepted many places outside of the US in lieu of the local currency.

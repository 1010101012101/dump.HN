If they provide audio playback support for the Kindle they could sell combined Audio/eBooks that  maybe even highlight the spoken text and turn in time to the audio?<p>I think this could be good for both audio books and ebooks as well as when considering the implications for educational books (such as language books or religious study materials).",1235555892

I think the fundamental question is ""what is a performance?"".  I just find it hard to see that kindle reading = voice actor reading.  Why go to the concert, when you've got a player piano?

494179,comment,494118,494118,0,0,barrkel,,,"The article is most useful as a very high-level introduction to the topic to a junior C programmer, from a Linux viewpoint. Factually, it's not particularly accurate; in particular:<p>* Precise garbage collection is listed as having moderate allocation speed (precise GC normally uses just a bounds-check and increment - it ought to be the fastest), moderate deallocation speed (deallocation is free in GC - you pay for collection, but that collects live objects, not freed memory), and ""rarely"" SMP friendly - but collection is a trivially parallelizable operation in a way that manual allocation never is.<p>* Reference counting is described as having ""excellent"" cache locality, when this is one of the weakest areas of reference counting; every reference copy operation comes with an indirection and, usually, a memory-bus assertion to ensure correct multi-threaded reference count updates.<p>* Manual allocators such as malloc etc. are described as being ""easy"" to use, when this is definitely not the case - if it were easy, most programs using it would be free of access violations and memory leaks. Meanwhile, if reference counting or precise (i.e. memory-safe) GC is built into the language in question, allocation is actually quite hard to get wrong. To describe malloc/etc as ""easy"" and most of the others as ""moderate"" is a severe misrepresentation.",1235555044

How many books will be bought because of the extra usefulness of the audio feature? Instead, they are biting the hand that feeds them. Not only that, but they are also obstructing the advancement of technology and innovation by reducing their usefulness. First Google Books and now this. What a bunch of ungrateful bastards - hardly better than the RIAA.",1235554883

I <i>own</i> the book I bought, so recording myself (or anyone else) reading it is completely within my rights.<p>If I suddenly don't need to record myself, because technology reaches a point where a piece of software can read <i>my book</i> just as well as I can, then that's just the way it is.<p>If a temporary inconvenience creates a business opportunity for you, great. But you can't expect to hold onto that business once the inconvenience is gone.<p>The content industries need to understand that they can sell ""a book"" or ""a movie"", or ""a song"", but they can't sell music that only plays on certain devices, or DVDs that only play in certain continents, or books that you can read silently but not out loud.

But the opinion espoused in this piece is the classic argument that just because an industry has grown accustomed to a particular revenue stream or business model, they should therefore always and forever have the privilege of keeping it. And anyone who introduces products or technology to prevent that or cut into their revenue is not playing fair, morally questionable, and/or should have to compensate them for lost revenue.<p>It's a ridiculous argument.",1235553674

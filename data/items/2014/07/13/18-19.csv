The idea that Amazon itself is critical to internet infrastructure is very disturbing, yet in many cases, it&#x27;s true these days. We really need to get other cloud providers in the mix.<p>Amazon as a retail store has been consistently great for me in all major aspects. Any issues I&#x27;ve had with orders have been promptly resolved and Amazon has gone to bat for me several times. I agree that Wal-mart or another major department store could give Amazon a run for its money if they played their cards right, but like you, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re in that headspace.",1405277937

This isn&#x27;t a simplistic, classical microeconomic analysis.<p>First, just because a multi-billion dollar market exists for a product, that doesn&#x27;t mean that there aren&#x27;t highly profitable, multi-million dollar markets that exist in the same industry.  This is <i>especially</i> true when the &quot;market&quot; is impacted by things things like trade policy asymmetry, sanctions, embargoes and national policy.<p>Second, there&#x27;s no reason to think this &quot;market&quot; is motivated solely or even primarily by revenue/profit in the classic sense.  If you add the &quot;benefit&quot; of poking the West in the eye, and the national pride angle, the alternative market decision isn&#x27;t &quot;I could make money doing other things with this money&quot;.  The whole history of the Cold War proves this out.<p>There&#x27;s a reason MiGs and AKs are common as cockroaches.<p>Third, it doesn&#x27;t matter what a fab costs to build, unless you want to build one.  This is an arbitrage issue; there&#x27;s plenty of non-Western places that have first-world fab capacity that would be more than happy to crank out Russian IP all day long.  More importantly, they have local, non-Western talent to do the heavy lifting associated with tailoring Russian IP to fine geometry fabrication.<p>Ultimately, this is a political, not economic decision.  And it doesn&#x27;t <i>matter</i> if Intel has a bigger/faster/stronger processor (I agree with you that it will).  It matters that the Russians (just like the Chinese have done for a decade with Loongson) can legitimately say &quot;we have a locally produced alternative to the Western hegemony&quot;.  And let&#x27;s not forget that the Chinese have taken what amounts to a licensed MIPS derivative with a fraction of Intels R&D budget and produced top-10 TFLOP supercomputers.  Also see: ARM.<p>And I want to point out something that I don&#x27;t see mentioned that much.  If you read the proceedings of HotChips or one of the other conferences, not all, or even most, of those papers are being submitted by Westerners.  While they work mostly for Western companies now, it&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re the only source of innovation in the world.

Look, I&#x27;m a lawyer who, among other things, helps process DMCA requests. The service provider does not have to comply with obviously invalid DMCA requests to maintain safe harbor.  In particular, things that are not properly the subject of a DMCA request <i>are invalid requests</i>, no matter how &quot;well formed&quot; they otherwise seem.<p>Alternatively, under 512(c)(3)(B)(ii), github could have asked them if they were the authorized owner of popcorn time, or otherwise attempted to get them to clarify.<p>&quot;Popcorn Time is the subject of infringing activity, and hence this would be a valid takedown notice.\n&quot;\nErr, no.  Subject of infringing activity is talking about websites that host files for users, not source code to programs that, 65 steps later, may possibly be used to infringe.<p>As 512(c) itself says, it is &quot;for infringement of copyright by reason of the storage at the direction of a user of material that resides on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider&quot;<p>IE <i>direct hosting</i>.<p>(one of the other subsections deals with linking sites, and that clearly doesn&#x27;t apply either)<p>Please explain how github&#x27;s storage of source code of popcorn time, alone, is somehow infringement of copyright (hint: there is no legal theory where it is, any more than there is a legal theory that owning the machinery to a printing press is).<p>It&#x27;s way too remote a connection to be &quot;the subject of infringing activity&quot;, and no court has ever held otherwise.<p>As for whether they get to make this decision, in order for it to be a valid DMCA notice, it has to be directed at something valid to be filing a notice for under 512(c).  It isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not a valid notice, no matter how formal it looks.<p>Additionally, it requires \n&quot;A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.&quot;<p>The material complained about is popcorn time.  They cannot possibly validly make a statement that popcorn time is not being used as authorized by the copyright owner, it&#x27;s agent, or the law, as the use is clearly authorized by the copyright owner of popcorn time.<p>Instead, they made a statement that <i>operating and further evelopment of popcorn time</i> causes a bunch of stuff that, later on, may cause something unauthorized by the copyright owner.<p>Here is the exact statement the MPAA made:\n&quot;occurring by virtue of the operation and further development of the GitHub projects Popcorn Time, and Time4Popcorn (the “Projects”).&quot;<p>This is not a valid claim under 512(c) or 512(d), and i&#x27;d challenge you to find a case that says &quot;operation and further development of a project&quot; is the proper subject of a DMCA notice under 512(c).<p>The proper thing for the MPAA to do, if they wanted it down, was file a contributory or indirect infringement case against github.",1405276501

Microsoft already got itself in very hot water for trying to strongarm people off of its platform entirely (Netscape antitrust case), so they&#x27;re not about to try that again. You can make software for Windows, but Microsoft is going to use their clout in legally &quot;fair&quot; ways to make sure you don&#x27;t damage their lock-in. Java was a very serious threat to MS, which is why they created .NET and built an enterprise sales apparatus around it.<p>Sun lost its way and Microsoft ate up most of the custom enterprise software market with .NET. A pity really; the future could&#x27;ve looked much different if Sun had successfully and aggressively countered .NET. MS made sure it didn&#x27;t happen because write once, run anywhere meant that Windows wasn&#x27;t going to be very important anymore. .NET touted similar features, but the catch was they only wrote a VM for MS platforms, incidentally.<p>Pre-reply: Yes, Mono exists, Microsoft made minor contributions here and there to it, but it is now and always has been a second-class citizen in this space, and Microsoft will ensure that it always will be. It seems Mono typically gets support for an API just as it becomes deprecated and its new big brother starts to emerge on Windows. That&#x27;s intentional.",1405276483

He didn&#x27;t ask if it is within his legal right, which is what you seem to be stuck on. He even mentioned that their lawyers assured them there would be no legal ramifications. The question (s)he asked is whether or not this is ETHICAL.<p>As to the person that suggested he &quot;do whatever is in his best interest within legal limits&quot;: there are other things in life besides money. This may not be true for everyone, but it&#x27;s clearly at least somewhat true for OP, since (s)he asked this question in the first place.<p>Now, as a freelancer, I have been in your shoes a few times before, when I could have easily adapted the client&#x27;s project and published it as a SaaS. I imagine it may be even easier for you, since you represent a company, that probably has the funds to also properly promote and advertise a SaaS project, not just develop it.<p>So, it may go against the collective opinion, and the term &quot;ethical&quot; can be somewhat subjective, but I will argue that no, it&#x27;s NOT ethical, despite you being well within your legal rights. When somebody pays for a project, they are already taking the huge risk that the project will fail spectacularly. For them having to worry that their contractor will also just take their project, repackage it, and come into direct competition with them, well, this is simply not fair. Reusing code is one thing, simply tweaking their project and releasing it on your own is quite another.<p>Also, not only do I think what&#x27;t you&#x27;re doing is wrong towards your client, I think what you&#x27;re doing is actually hurting all of us. Freelancers and software companies alike. If every software contractor would start repackaging their customers&#x27; products, pretty soon no one would have enough trust in any of us, and for good reason.<p>Now, you may say, as others have already said in this thread, &quot;If they don&#x27;t want this to happen to them, they should protect themselves in the contract&quot;, and this is a valid argument, as formal logic goes. However, the relation between customer and contractor shouldn&#x27;t be one where both sides have to always stay on their guard, always expecting for the other side to screw them somehow.<p>Somebody might also argue that it&#x27;s also not fair towards you if, for every project you develop for a customer, you close a door in your potential future, and this is also a valid argument, but it&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m saying. Again, there is a substantial difference between applying the things you learned about the client&#x27;s business in a project in a different segment within the same market (I am using very vague terms, I know, but it&#x27;s only because I don&#x27;t know the details of this particular project), and using their own project to compete with them, after they paid you to develop it.<p>We sure love hating on soulless corporations that will stop at nothing for profit, yet when it&#x27;s us that are doing it it&#x27;s suddenly ok. How about we treat each other with some basic dignity for a change? If you think a customer&#x27;s idea is worth implementing for yourself, don&#x27;t use the guy simply as a way to fund your own projects. Refuse their project if you think you would like to do something similar yourself. And if you already developed it for them, move on, there will be other ideas.",1405275990

Not to mention that most people would likely read this and think it only applies to revenge porn and doesn&#x27;t have implications to content published in a mutually consensual nature, where the consent was later revoked. Or where a person has their data hacked and leaked and the ex jumps to the conclusion that the content was posted by the creator to hurt them.<p>It&#x27;s nice that they protected minors by only including people over the age of 18 in the definition, but to me, the issue is that laws like this allow for potential abuse by former romantic partners and prosecutorial abuse if charges are ever pressed and that isn&#x27;t at all clear in the way the law is written.<p>And the article also doesn&#x27;t stipulate that the damages guaranteed by this law are not only the fines of up to a $10,000 which just goes to the court but also the right of the victim to file a civil suit with a minimum $10,000 + legal fees.

It offers better recommendations and can do things Zite couldn&#x27;t.<p>This is not to discount the groundbreaking work done by the Zite team at the time; the last CEO of Zite is a friend who managed the product well. It&#x27;s always easier when you&#x27;ve been able to learn what other companies have done well and what they haven&#x27;t. And we&#x27;ve been able to do things like using Google App Engine for the backend from the beginning, which wouldn&#x27;t exactly have been possible when Zite was founded 9 years ago (and because of earlier GAE limitations and higher costs may not even have been practical even 2-3 years ago).<p>As a practical matter, Zite is about to be discontinued with some of its features, in theory, to be eventually incorporated into Flipboard.

They are not, even if they allow to build new components (maybe using scripts). I wanted to illustrate the challenges from that perspective.<p>I did not want to fundamentally criticize your ability to tackle those problems or imply that patoline is not fitting to those problems. My biggest problem was that the About page gave me no idea about your system as a typesetting system, only as a programming environment and some of that gives me a bit of a headache. This is by the way shared with many other projects, my pet peeve is a programming language that mentions it&#x27;s own name only once on the About page and Haskell thrice ;). Be more self-centric! What is patoline, not compared to TeX?<p>If you read anything else out of that - I am sorry for phrasing that wrong.<p>Still, as a maintainer of a software that is often criticized in similar fashions (we build a web framework in Ruby that is not Rails), I would recommend to take the criticism as a less emotional matter. Software is rarely our actual baby and it often helps more to just discuss the actual points of the criticism or check whether there is a misunderstanding (this, in this instance, also applies to me).<p>As a final word: Sorry for what came out of that.

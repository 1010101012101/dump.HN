He said ""We don't live in space, we camp there."" And by example he suggested what if there was no food, fuel, or running water in Barstow California. Everyone would have to carry what they expected to use from Los Angeles, stay for a while and then go back to Los Angeles to reload with supplies. Now imagine there is a toll gate on I15 outside San Bernadino that charges you $100M to use the road between LA and Barstow. Now what kind of town would Barstow be? A ghost town.<p>Space, and low earth orbit in particular, is the same way. We don't have any infrastructure up there. Just a single campsite. Every time we launched the shuttle we took perfectly good fuel and burned it up in the atmosphere because we had no way to take the left overs from the external tank and store them in orbit. If you consider just that one problem, keeping fuel around. You see how far we are from living in space vs just visiting.<p>At $54M/pop SpaceX will make somethings a lot more accessible in space. Putting some infrastructure in space like a gas station and a space tug, will go a lot further.",1337720360

It's safe to assume that Ellen is a smart woman who realises the risk this poses to her career, and any smart person wouldn't wish to burn the progress they have made over years for some mythical ""pay day."" That's why I can say with some amount of confidence that KPCB failed to address concerns in a responsible manner and let things come this far.<p>To quote from the filing;<p><pre><code>    Upon information and belief, Ray Lane and John Doerr discussed
    how to respond to to Plaintiff. Ray Lane met with Plaintiff.
    While acknowledging that Mr. Nazre's behavior was inappropriate
    Mr. Lane pressured Plaintiff to drop the matter because of
    Mr. Lane''s close ties with and mentorship of Mr. Nazre.
    Though Plaintiff had formally cmplained about Mr. Nazre's behavior,
    Mr. Lane encouraged Plaintiff to engage in a personal relationship
    with Mr. Nazre and even to marry him. Mr. Lane said, however,
    that in such case, either Plaintiff or Mr. Nazre would have to
    leave the firm because two spouses could not work together at KPCB.
    Mr. Lane said he and Mr. Nazre had discussed Plaintiff's report
    of sexual harrassment.
    
    KPCB was aware of and did not take reasonable steps to prevent
    retaliation and gender discrimination. KPC management was aware
    of and did not prevent Mr. Nazre from engaging in repeated
    retaliatory behavior for nearly five years. Following her formal
    complaint described above, Ray Lane insisted that Plaintiff
    have a one-on-one lunch with Mr. Nazre outside the office
    to discuss their relationship. Plaintiff saw no choice but
    to comply with the demand of a Managing Partner. Unsurprisingly,
    Mr. Nazre made inappropriate comments and engaged in unprofessional
    behavior, and seemed to be further empowered by KPCB to further
    retaliate against her.

    2. more than > 10% + x% better with something less than 100% certainty to compensate the founders for the variance...
</code></pre>
The more established / validated the startup, the harder it is for the engineer to deliver sufficient value or certainty to the founders to warrant more than the standard early-stage hire stake.<p>So generally these decisions are probably made with non-economic reasons, like ""We like each other"" or ""I get off on working on bleeding edge technologies"" or ""The engineer is willing to give up substantial economic EV in return for te ability to feel like part of a team or affect decision making"".<p>TLDR: engineers work for companies when the needs of the engineer and the company converge. the bid and ask between ""what an engineer needs/delivers"" and ""what the startup offers/needs"" separate as early stage startups move past ""MVP"" into being somewhat validated.",1337720252

4009858,comment,4008671,4008671,1,0,anigbrowl,,,"The doodle is reminiscent of a Minimoog [1], but with several simplifications to make programming easier and more musical.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moog_synthesizer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moog_synthesizer</a><p>Mixer section<p>The large knob at the left is overall level (which does not equate to silence at its minimum setting, probably for UI simplicity). The three knobs to the right govern the volume of 3 individual oscillators.<p>Oscillator section<p>The leftmost 3 knobs define the pitch octave range for each of the three oscillators. LO is a subsonic frequency mainly used for modulation purposes in real life. #2', 16', 8' etc. refer to the length, in feet, of the pipe on a pipe organ that will produce tones of that frequency. A 32 foot long pipe produces a very deep bass tone (about 16 Hz, probably sounds like noise on most speakers), a 16 foot pipe produces a tone exactly one octave higher, and so forth. There are no 64 foot pipes that I know of, hence the LO setting. It's not possible on this little synth, but normally you would use those super-low frequencies as modulation sources for other things. The two knobs in the center allow tuning of the oscillators across a 2-octave range. Really, this ought to be graduated in semitones. If you turn down the center oscillator and put the other two on identical settings, you should, in theory, get the same sound only twice as loud, but the doodle is a little bit buggy and sometimes pegs one oscillator an octave above or below the other. It's easiest to just reload periodically. On a real-life analog synth of that generation, the oscillators would drift out of tune and need to be calibrated periodically; also, the tuning would change as the machine warmed up over the first half-hour or so of operation, so early electronic keyboard players often had difficulty staying in tune with the band. It was this pitch instability that caused everyone to rush towards digital synthesis at the end of the 1970s, although nowadays you can get very stable analog oscillators.<p>The rightmost 3 knobs set the shape for each oscillator; triangle, saw, inverse saw, and pulse waves with 10%, 25% and 50% duty cycles respectively. I think there is something amiss with the display of the saw waves on oscillators 1 & 2. Saw vs. inverse saw makes no difference on a single oscillator but where you have 2 or 3 choosing different directions for the wave can lead to interesting textures. The shape of the oscillator affects the harmonic content thereof. A triangle wave sounds very close to a sine wave - a piercing pure tone - while being computationally inexpensive. (Stable sine waves are surprisingly hard to generate on the fly unless you have a lot of DSP power, and even digital synthesizer manufacturers often cheat by using lookup tables for sine waves rather than generating them.) A saw waves contains all possible harmonics and is a good basis for brassy sounds like those of trumpets. Square waves (pulse waves with a 50% duty cycle) sound 'hollow' because they only have odd harmonics, and are a good basis for synthesizing woodwind sounds, where the absorbent nature of the material dulls the sound somewhat. Combining pulse waves of different duty cycle can lead to texturally interesting effects, although this is much more noticeable when the length of the duty cycle can be modulated, as opposed to merely switched.<p>Filter section<p>Something has gone terribly terribly wrong here, because this does not behave like any Moog synthesizer I have ever used. The top left knob controls the filter cutoff of a low pass filter, ie the frequency above which higher harmonics will be cut off. This is sort of like the effect you get if you sing a continuous AAAAAH tone with your mouth open and then gradually close your lips. Normally the knob tot he immediate right could control resonance, which boosts the signal around the cutoff frequency and produces an intense whistling/shrieking sound as it is turned up to maximum. High resonance and low cutoff settings act like a spotlight upon the timbral complexity of the oscillator output and are a staple of electronic music.<p>2. <a href=""http://www.timstinchcombe.co.uk/synth/Moog_ladder_tf.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.timstinchcombe.co.uk/synth/Moog_ladder_tf.pdf</a><p>I am not sure what the rest of the knobs are supposed to do. They seem to allow oscillators 2 and 3 to be individually filtered, but unfortunately when I hold down a key and tweak the filter knobs the sound tends to break up. This is probably because the adjustment of filter and resonance controls in DSP require constant recalibration of filter coefficients, which is computationally expensive and not well implemented here. It is not normal to filter individual oscillators on an analog synthesizer. Normally one wants to apply a single filter to the mixed sound of the oscillators and modulate that with an envelope or low-frequency-oscillator. Visually, this looks (slightly) reminiscent of a Moog Ladder filter [2], but that's usually a 4-stage transistor ladder, not a front panel set of controls.<p>This is not how a synth of this style normally works, which is a real pity. It does not help that there are no tooltips; I've been making electronic music for 15 years and can't figure out exactly what's supposed to be going on here, so I feel bad for anyone who is trying to learn something from playing with this and getting frustrated. I tried looking at the javascript [3] but it's unreadable outside of an editor and I have neither the time nor the inclination to troubleshoot it.<p>3. <a href=""http://www.google.com.au/logos/2012/moog.2.js"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com.au/logos/2012/moog.2.js</a><p>Envelope section<p>This is the simplest part; the envelope defines the volume behavior when you press a key. The topmost knob is attack, or how fast the sound fades in; very fast for a plucked instrument like a bass guitar, slow for a string sound. The sound swells to maximum over the duration of the attack time, then falls back to the sustain level, adjusted by the middle knob. The last knob governs release, how fast the sound fades away after the envelope completes its cycle. If you set this very short the sound will die even if you hold a key down. Due to some oddities in the input processing event queue, as with the oscillators, the envelope's behavior is rather less than consistent.<p>As for the switch and the modulation wheel, I'm not clear on what is connected to what, for the reasons described above. I'm guessing there is an invisible low frequency oscillator for vibrato/tremolo purposes (modulation either the base frequency or the amplitude slightly to give a sound some extra texture), but the lack of tooltips and inconsistent behavior make them difficult to use in any predictable way.<p>If you are fascinated by this tool but frustrated, as I was, by the implementation problems, then you might like Morningstar (<a href=""http://bitterspring.net/ms/morningstar/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitterspring.net/ms/morningstar/</a>) - a basic html5 emulation of a popular Korg synthesizer/groovebox.

starting this thread to help out understanding the new hybrid web/mobile infrastructure, let's call it Web NG.<p>Here's my understanding but please criticize elaborating valid alternatives where you disagree.<p>SERVER SIDE:<p>Back end exposes RESTful services secured by OAuth authentication.<p>Server can adopt any language (polyglot), possibly reside in the cloud.
It will possibly use multiple SQL/NOSql datastores (right tool for the job).
(IaaS and BaaS will play a relevant role here).<p>In this scenario (auto)scalability and efficiency are more and more desirable as in the cloud hardware and bandwith is paid ""as you go"".<p>CLIENT SIDE:<p>The client will be multiplatform: the best candidate seems to be Html5. Do you agree? Will still native be a must for certain complex applications? 
(By the way, will Apple, after killing Flash in favour of Html5, kill Html5 to preserve their native ecosystem?)<p>In case of Html5: will the app make use of a JS MVC framework (AngularJS, Backbone, Ember etc.) plus JQuery mobile? Valid alternatives?<p>Will still CORS be a problem? How to effectively circumvent the cross domain requests problem?<p>In case of a native solution: will the app use a multiplatform framework such as PhoneGap or Titanium?  How far can a multiplatform framwork support a really complex front end application?<p>In both cases, the app at startup, and when needed, will synchronize data from server to a LOCAL Datastore (html5 embedded db?) and viceversa.<p>When required by user interaction, the app will enqueue asynchronous REST requests: each of them will be served as soon as possible (aka as soon as network is available). The app will provide effective feedback when the request will not be served ""real time"" and push proper notifications as soon as the request has been succesfully/unsuccesfully served.<p>What do you think about it?

4009691,comment,4008733,4008733,11,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Interesting conversation. The answer is actually much simpler. ""Never work for a salary that you can't live on."" which is to say that if you are an employee of a startup you should first make sure that you can live day to day on your compensation before you talk about equity. Remember that compensation consists of salary, benefits, and vacation time. They all contribute.<p>Once you have that out of the way, you can think about 'extra'.<p>Getting the 'extra' as equity has the highest <i>potential</i> return and the lowest <i>probable</i> return. Which is to say that if the startup has an exit that involves the common stock you could potentially get millions of dollars. However startups are startups because they are as yet unproven businesses. Their chance of failure is high early on and it goes down in proportion to revenue.<p>What that means is that when a startup is later stage, has a product and some revenue, its less likely to fail than when it first starts and before it has a product or revenue.<p>So generally you can split startups into fairly large risk baskets.<p>Basket 1: pre-product / post-product<p>Startups that are pre-product are the highest risk, and the getting 'extra' as equity here is something of a sucker's bet. The company has yet to prove they can even <i>build</i> what it is they want to build, much less sell it or get users.<p>Basket 2 (post-product): pre-revenue / post-revenue<p>Startups that have a product can be spit into those that have convinced a customer to pay them money for their product and those that haven't. The sad truth is that some products cannot be sold profitably or at all. So the next big 'milestone' is that there is revenue coming in from customers who are using/buying the product. Pre-revenue is higher risk, post revenue lower risk.<p>Basket 3 (post-product, post-revenue): Traction / No Traction<p>The third split is the traction/no-traction split. If a startup has customers and revenue, they have crossed the 'big' hurdles, but to grow they need more customers. That is where traction comes into play. Is the startup getting new customers? What is it costing to get them? Do those costs outweigh the revenue they generate?<p>If your startup is post-product, post-revenue, and has traction <i>always</i> take equity. It is going to pay back better than salary.",1337717193

But the parallels between this thread and threads about software pricing are spooky: it's as if the part of the brain that enables most people to understand pointers-to-pointers and function pointers somehow <i>cancels out</i> some of the part of the brain that enables people to intuit how markets work.<p>Suffice it to say I am geeking out over this issue, not moralizing about it. Although: there's a moral component, and as a message board nerd, I'll pitch a little fit if we pretend that there isn't one. :)",1337716807

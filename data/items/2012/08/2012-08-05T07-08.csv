Just read the man page. Whoops, it doesn't actually mention that, but it does mention that it may happen automatically at times.<p>So only clever people like you know archaic undocumented side effects of git's inscrutable design, except nobody ever really knows the full story because there is so much unnecessary crud to learn in addition. Clearly more can be destructive than gc if gc can be executed by other commands and triggers by repository state.",1344153141

4340882,comment,4340641,4340641,11,0,richardjordan,,,"The bogus business model of in-game purchasing needs to be called BS on too.  Yes I know it works in other countries, but that's usually in intense games where the engagement is high and long term.<p>My household probably counts as a high dollar in-game purchasing one.  We probably boosted the numbers of some game developer.<p>Reality:  a kids game had a $99 purchase option for hearts on the screen and my then 7-yo daughter not really understanding this was real money, spotted her mom putting in her password for App downloads and copied it to make about $400 of in-game purchases.  This is nothing but a scam.  There's no legitimate reason a game targeted at that age-group has a $99 purchase option other than to try to trick kids into spending money they don't know is being spent.<p>As the OP says - the quality of their product is terrible and once novelty wears off, apart from a few people with addiction issues their business model collapses.<p>Hate Zynga.  Hate Groupon.  Hate that they made such a big splash as tech IPOs yet will ultimately crash and the harm will spread to tech startups in general as the markets learn to distrust tech IPOs again.",1344152902

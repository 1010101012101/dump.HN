I always hate those ""I could do your job, but you couldn't do mine"".<p>Saying that publishing content is easier now due to the work of programmers trying to appeal to a less technical audience would have been truthful and would have made a good point.  Saying that journalist could learn to program easier then a programmer could learn to be a journalist is presumptive and would depend quite a bit on the individual.",1256702360

I have written on this topic occasionally:<p><a href=""http://www.andrewljohnson.com/article/Fixing%20the%20App%20Store%20with%20Measure%20of%20Credibility"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.andrewljohnson.com/article/Fixing%20the%20App%20S...</a><p>It's not just that ""everyone else is doing it"" that makes it OK to do. If you want your star ratings to be in the same league as the rest of the apps on the store, then you have to generate more reviews than your regular users will provide to keep up with everyone else. It's not a matter of OK - it's a matter of survival.<p>I do wish there was more credibility to the reviews on the App Store, but that's just not the way it is. Maybe someday Apple's system won't demand all developers get all their buddies to buy and review their app. It's just absolutely pervasive - go check out some popular apps and see if you can pick out all the fake reviews. The clear giveaways are: 1) has only written one review, or only reviewed the app and competitors 2) references new features in the app 3) badmouths competitors 4) long and rambling. The fake reviews usually have some combination of these.<p>As long as the big guys are paying for reviews, I don't consider it even a little bit unethical to review my own app. Even in my little navigation market, the top app has a company and at least a dozen iPhones - that's a dozen automatic five star reviews. I can't compete on this front, but I can try.",1256702331

It is a very nice app.<p>If Apple offered this app as a standard feature on all iPhones it would really set the iPhone apart even more from the competition in their advertising. Hopefully BUMP’s IP on this is very solid, it can’t be very hard to duplicate this feature for the customer under a different set of instructions.",1256699615

Turns out they were piloting it as a potential replacement for Lotus Notes (yikes). I don't think they actually decided to go with it, but the fact that a big firm would even consider a hosted solution for something like email -- especially in the financial sector, where there's constant obsession over security and regulatory compliance -- rocked my world a bit.",1256699587

The largest ontological framework I'm aware of is Cyc, which uses its own proprietary ontology and is at least as complex as OWL ever was or will be.

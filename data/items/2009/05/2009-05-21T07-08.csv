But realistically, if there's any outrage over this, it won't be because a couple of YouTube employees had a bad day.",1242892668

620069,comment,619971,620058,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I would be tempted to agree, except that I know somewhere there's a ConOps person who has to remove all that porn.  And given that ConOps always has more to do than time to do it, this is probably in addition to all the other stuff her regular job requires.  Remember that there's a person behind all those abuse complaints - somebody just had a very rough day.<p>It's like how I always thought it was fine to scrape big companies' websites, until I'm the one that has to carry the pager.  It's all fun and games until someone loses a weekend.<p>(I really shouldn't complain though, considering that I dragged spez into fixing an XSRF vulnerability in Reddit on a Sunday morning by exploiting it in a very public manner.  If there's a God in charge of overseeing nefarious hijinks on websites, I think I've got more karmic retribution coming.)",1242892277

Templates are widely used in container formats, but in real world programming, for example when people model shopping carts or so, most of the code out there does not use templates.

I'm sure there are people who do have a preference to live this way without any eco-political agendas. I think I might be one of them. The thought of being able to live independently from society (in terms of sustainability and self-sufficiency) is intriguing to me, just because it means that I am relatively protected from external forces which I have little control over.",1242891963

620063,comment,619739,619968,0,0,wheels,,,"I'm not sure that's descriptive so much as an ideal.<p>In practice (mentioned this in the blog comments as well) I've found that the C++ world is somewhat divided between what I'll label the Boost and Qt camps.<p>Boost, as kind of a conceptual child of the STL, has extended more along the axis of exploring what's possible with the language, at times at the cost of pragmatism.  The Qt camp, on the other hand, tends to hide most of the heavy use of generic programming in private classes and exposes more simplified APIs, typically with minimal use of templates in public APIs.<p>I personally, as a former long-time KDE developer, fall firmly in the Qt camp and it shows in the way that I write C++.  It's also the style that's been preferred in the two companies where I've been employed as a C++ developer.<p>Which is <i>modern</i> is mostly a semantic issue.  I'd wager that while advanced template programming is more cutting-edge, it's also not in fact the way that very much C++ today is actually written, which is the definition of modern I was working with.",1242891872

My personal view is that (North American?) society is strangely prudish about porn (which isn't going anywhere - why stick your head in the sand) while being remarkably comfortable with violence.  This is why I say that, in my view, this prank doesn't actually hurt anyone.<p>Anyway, I'm sure this will be controversial, and that there are aspects I'm not thinking of.

620054,comment,619871,619975,0,0,catch23,,,"Though postgresql is much easier than mysql currently (for windows installations).  There's all kinds of ""gotchas"" on windows if you're installing mysql.  For example, the normal mysql 5.1 on windows doesn't have innodb, so if you choose ""transactional database"" during install, mysql dies in the middle of installation and refuses to start up.  By default mysql installs into ""Program Files"" but since that directory name has a space in it, mysql has issues.  Uninstalling it is also a pain, sometimes it doesn't fully remove itself and you have to fire up Regedit to remove the mysql key from the registry.<p>I experienced all of these while trying to help a friend install mysql on windows.  I honestly can't believe we spent 3 hours trying to install it.  There's a 100 thread posting in the mysql forums for installation troubles on windows so I'm sure I wasn't the only one.  On the mac it was as easy as ""port install mysql5"" and on my Debian machine it was just ""apt-get install mysql-server"".<p>Sadly, postgresql was so easy to install in cygwin, but cygwin doesn't have a mysql server equivalent.",1242891055

But when you actually look at what they've done:<p><pre><code>  * Create a simple pub sub backend message system\n  * Limit it to 140 characters\n  * Allow everyone uninhibited API access to it\n</code></pre>\nThat's a great public service they've done, but for me, it's not a great business.<p>They've definitely done a great job at appealing to a certain demographic. However, twitter isn't about engagement. It's not about communication. It's about broadcasting 1->many. It's about producers and consumers. That's IMHO what limits its usefulness.<p>As a business decision, giving away access to 3rd party developers seems like favoring short term growth well above profit and the future. Most people don't use twitter.com which if I was an investor would be worrying.<p>Facebook OTOH is far more engaging and compelling in its usefulness. You can quickly paste URLs, images, vids, etc. It's more about communication.<p>I'm not sure being popular should be the aim of a startup. You can be wildly popular for a year or two, then go out of fashion. The people using Twitter aren't particularly known for their loyalty either.",1262779085

I haven't changed my position, though, and the more you write in this thread, the more convinced I am that you don't know what you're talking about. The technical reasons are not strong; SSE2 is primarily for floating point ops and SIMD vectorized ops. Most user code does not use floating point, and it's hard for compilers to extract latent parallelism to produce vectorized code.<p>However, if you put the technical reasons aside, and only focus on the business reasons for making a choice here, it's clear to me that the best way to go is to fall in line with the existing precedents for the platform. That way maximizes your business upside. There is <i>no business reason</i> for wanting 16-byte alignment, only business reasons for <i>not</i> wanting it.<p>The technical case would need to <i>outweigh</i> the business case in order for it to win. But I don't see the technical case as being that strong. Floating point code is rare. Outside of scalable vector-oriented UI libraries and domain-specific number crunching, it's hardly ever used. Many architectures survived for decades with only optional support for floating point, in a coprocessor. Many embedded architectures still use emulated FP, if it's needed at all.<p>And I really meant it about shockingly naive back there. It tells me everything I need to know about what you know about commercial compilers: that you think of them in the academic sense of being the bit that turns text into code. There's more to it than that in the real world.",1262778224

At the same time because you will have to regularly make use of the huge Java library. So it's a good idea to know about classes, objects, basic syntax and primitive types.\nOf course you will put the focus on Clojure. I also recommend SICP and Scheme. Scheme, in its R5RS form, is a really good pedagogical programming language. I learned it at school and it was a really good experience. One that forever changes the way you think about programming. But I didn't get that at the time, only later :)\nYou can do the SICP exercises with Clojure instead of Scheme.\nI would avoid digging into C++ or Common Lisp now. Those are quite complex. Keep CL for later, and forget about C++ :)\nNext get deeper into Java and start to learn a ""scripting"" language like Ruby, Python or Perl.\nAll in all, I think it is really important to grasp different programming paradigms: functional (Lisp, Haskell, ML, Erlang, ...), logic with Prolog, procedural/OO with Java (can get you a job :-), distributed (Erlang) ...\nThere are a lot of other interesting languages out there but it is a good start: Clojure + Java.",1262775644

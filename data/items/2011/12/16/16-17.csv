3361186,comment,3359498,3360802,7,0,scarmig,,,"Well, I think the issue is that socialism (and capitalism, for that matter) means very different things to different people.<p>For instance,  you identify ""collective ownership of the means of production""  as central to the idea of socialism, and the USSR as a society with collective ownership of the means of production. There's a tricky elision there, though, in that it identifies ""state ownership"" with ""collective ownership."" Chomsky and other anarchists raise hell at that idea because to them, the State is not an instrument of collective decision making.<p>For more context: anarchists played a major role in revolutionary socialist Russia, with the popular party of the peasantry (the Socialist Revolutionaries) being in some ways one of the more anarchist political parties in history (supporting, for instance, land and industry collectivization instead of land and industry nationalization). They were quite popular, having over twice the number of representatives as the Bolsheviks, the second largest party. They quickly came to oppose the Bolsheviks and were among Lenin's first victims. This is is in addition to a hardcore anarchist movement also popular in Russia at the time (and also heavily victimized by the Bolsheviks).<p>The point of all that? They all considered themselves socialist and disagreed that Bolshevism would lead to socialism, disagreeing strongly enough that it often led to their deaths. Chomsky isn't pulling the ""the USSR wasn't socialist"" out of a hat, but is bringing up an ideological point that's existed since even before the USSR formally existed. And to an anarchist, the idea that the USSR was socialism is as alien to them as the idea that the USSR was capitalist is to you. (The fact that the USSR called itself socialist they would argue was just a propagandist slogan, just as a Tea Partyer might consider Obama calling himself a capitalist as meaningless political rhetoric to take advantage of the less critically minded.)",1324054166

In your envelope example, once you open the fourth envelope and discover nothing inside it you can <i>simultaneously</i> be surprised that it wasn't there and that the fifth envelope <i>will</i> contain the heart. In other words, the two events collapse into one. Similarly, when going to class on Thursday you will be ""surprised"" to find that the test is not that day but rather the next.

This has been such a long term trend that it has become thoroughly predictable.<p>This is not the fault of Gruber. It's a result of the selection bias applied by Hacker News as a whole. If you read Daring Fireball regularly, and not just the excerpts that make it to HN, you'll see that he <i>frequently</i> chastises Apple for what he believes are missteps. Here's a recent example:<p><pre><code>  http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/10/26/against-skeuomorphism\n</code></pre>\nYou can't hold the guy responsible for the fact that only a certain subset of his articles ever makes it to the front page of HN.",1324051785

Many ebooks published in the last year, I noticed, started at one price, and have been coming down.<p>It seems in the first year, the price is usually $12.99-$15.99, but after a year or so, the price drops to $9.99.<p>I figure in 5 years we'll see several pricing tiers:\n$22.99- premium new book from a big name author<p>$17.99- premium book with a following (Eg: the next Twilight book in a series.)<p>$15.99- regular ""hardcover"" price for a new book.<p>$13.99- Discount hardcover price for a new book.<p>$9.99- The standard back catalog price for books published \nin the last 10 years, or which still have strong sales.<p>$7.99- Discount, pulp or paper back price (this is currently the common price on sci-fi paperbacks, or at least used to be, I suspect its higher now with inflation.)<p>$5.99- Discount book or pamphlets, like guides and introductions, or older less popular paperback type books.<p>$3.99- premium articles.<p>$0.99- Short articles<p>If the market is allowed to sort itself out, and ebooks become popular, this is the type of pricing we can expect, and this is the type of pricing you currently have in bookstores.   A spectrum of prices to fit a spectrum of products.<p>This is good.  It allows for experimentation with low prices, or high prices to try and make a viable business.<p>It would be really sad for book publishers to be locked into a pricing model that makes them increasingly irrelevant, and thus to have the book industry die the way the newspaper industry is dying.<p>But maybe its just that I don't mind waiting a year for books to get them for $9.99.  And if I really want the book, I don't mind paying $22.99.<p>The convenience of having my whole library on my phone far outweighs any difference in pricing between physical and ebooks.  Even if they're the same price, I'll still buy the ebook, though I think on the balance ebooks will be mostly cheaper.",1324051765

Tech startup business models and cultures can be very different from established business models and cultures.

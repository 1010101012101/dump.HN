Does the expected payoff from the tiny equity share justify the insecurity / lower comp / lack of benefits etc.?  Shouldn't you be automatically suspicious of anyone that would sign on to a deal like this?  If they are so great / can execute why aren't they working on their own ideas instead of yours?

The post sounded like it was against fully dynamic CMSes, not ""sites that have <i>any</i> dynamic feature"".<p>It really boils down to what you choose to optimize : security, read performance, write performance, write convenience or fancy features. Depending on the usage, some criteria don't matter at all, others are critical.<p>Static sites (and the CMSes which generate them) are at one end of the spectrum, optimizing security and read performance while leaving the rest behind. Fully dynamic sites (and the CMSes behind them) are almost the inverse. You can compromise and fall somewhere in between.",1256223411

It isn't just parental involvement -- there are plenty of bright accomplished people whose parents were busy doing something else during their upbringing. It isn't likely to be the toys that you get to play with, because there are bright kids even amongst the poorest of the poor -- though they do tend to be rarer exceptions.<p>I'd wager my money on a higher influence from genetics than many people in our society would currently want to believe. Some people, at birth, are predisposed to certain natural talents. They simply have good spatial reasoning, for example -- it's not something that they had to learn to mimic at a young age, it's something they were actually born with.<p>From there, the talent is subjected to environmental conditions, some positive, some adverse. Maybe their spatial reasoning and their parents' guidance gets them into sports instead of taking things apart. Maybe their natural talents manage to survive even very adverse environments.

Believe me, I know; I have an affiliate marketing site that tried (unsuccessfully) to compete against guys with big PPC marketing dollars, and I quickly learned SEO is the only way to go (for that site, anyway).<p>When I tried searching for SEOs, I was incredibly frustrated - there's no reputable source for objectively ranking SEO performance, and especially SEOs that work in particular industry verticals, so I decided to do something about it.  My site, SEOTrac.com, allows users to track, for free, the performance of their campaigns (PageRank moves over time, keyword ranking statistics, etc.).  The big question I’m trying to answer for everyone using SEO – you’ve spent $$ on improving your rankings; could you have done any better?  And with which SEO company?<p>Once I have enough SEO’s in my database, and enough campaigns, I’ll be able to rank the effectiveness of those SEOs, and give an objective data point to webmasters or site owners looking to add or improve SEO in their marketing mix.<p>Signup is free and as easy as adding a URL and clicking “Sign Up”, so in addition to comments, please add your site to the database (if not an SEO Campaign as well, either done in-house or through an professional).<p>I’m at michaelhn AT SEOTrac (dot) com if you want to reach out to me personally (including, if you think you can help over and above your HN comments).<p>Thanks!",1256222159

896784,comment,895072,896698,0,0,rabbitmq,,,"Thanks for your comment.<p>I could not find the 139 page document to which you refer.<p>There are two 0-91 docs, one is the spec definition for users, which as I said short and is mostly edge cases you can ignore.  There is a second doc for implementers which defines the classes and methods in more detail.  This is 63 pages long.  Note also that for the purposes of client codegen, the BSD licensed XML file in 0-91 is only a few pages long - because the <i>surface</i> of the spec is surprisingly small.<p>As a comparison, the definition of <i>core</i> XMPP (a Jabber server) in <a href=""http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3920.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3920.txt</a> is 90 pages.  BTW the core spec is just for IM not pubsub.<p>In the case of both AMQP and XMPP the length comes from the requirement to <i>interoperate</i> between implementations.<p>You make a good point about STOMP above.  We love STOMP too.  There is as you say a place for it - for lots of protocols.  We have however found with STOMP that because many behaviours are completely unspecified, that it costs us a lot more to support (find and fix bugs, maintain stable behaviour under different conditions, etc).  It is less likely that the same application talking to two STOMP brokers will behave the same way with both brokers - deterministically and predictably.  Maybe this is a good thing - there is more scope for competing implementations?  I don't think it's ideal.  And let's not talk about JMS in this regard.<p>I would not discourage people from writing their own brokers.  You are among many who have done this and people will go on doing it.  But although you may understand every line - what happens when someone else has to take over managing your code?  What if the requirements change - or the scope of use grows?  This is where products add value.<p>A lot of our customers have extremely simple requirements like ""don't ever lose my messages"" or ""broadcast to twenty different types of subscriber"".  So, I don't think it's fair to make generalisations about ""complex requirements"".<p>I completely agree with you about RPC.<p>Cheers,<p>alexis",1256221657
896783,comment,896445,896445,0,0,antirez,,,"edit: all this is based on retwis.antirez.com memory usage.<p>Ok, just did some math. In order to run Twitter using just Redis 1.001 without to use any new feature that may allow for memory savings, and guessing that Twitter currently contains 4,000,000,000 of tweets (assuming they save the full history for all the users, and that the recent 32 bit overflow means they rougly have 4 billion messages), 30 128GB Linux Boxes are needed.<p>Is this crazy? I don't know honestly as I don't know how many servers they may be using currently for the DB backend.<p>Btw the whole point is, IMHO, that many times to take the full dataset on Redis is not needed. For instance in twitter only recent messages are accessed frequently, together with user data, so it's probably a good idea to take only the latest N messages of every user in Redis (with background jobs moving old messages on disk incrementally), and take all the rest on MySQL or other on disk solution suitable to access stuff by-id.<p>So when you want to get a message from Redis, and from time to time get a NULL accessing to message:<id> you can run the same query against MySQL to get the data. That's something like this:<p><pre><code>    def getMessageById(id)
        m = redis.get(""message:""+id)
        if !m
            m = getMessageFromMySQL(id)
        end
        return m
    end
</code></pre>
In this context it is very simple to move old messages from a Redis server to a MySQL server, since messages are on a redis list, so it's possible to RPOP to get old elements, if LLEN (List length) reports that this user has more tweets that we want to take in the ""fast path"".<p>Also note that Redis supports expires in keys. So old messages got from MySQL can be set as expiring keys in order to avoid that a message that got linked in some front page will stress the MySQL too much.<p>This is just to give a feeling about scaling a pretty big service using Redis as main DB without caching layers.",1256221656

In our society, it's frowned upon if their parents do things like push them into beauty pageants.<p>People that are naturally strong or powerfully built don't have a responsibility to take a manual labor job, and nobody tells them that they aren't ""living up to their ability"" if they don't take a job in construction.<p>Now, there's a caveat: there are certain problems in human society which smart people are better suited to solving. That doesn't mean they <i>will</i> solve them -- most of the problems require multiple talents, and intelligence is just one -- but they do have some edge.<p>But that's not your responsibility, or mine, or anyone else's.

4911483,comment,4911204,4911204,6,0,btilly,,,"The problem is this.  At some point, in every checklist, you need to interact with other parts of the hospital.  For instance suppose that one step is to refer the patient to neurology.  What if you're in a country hospital and there is a neurologist on call, you can't simply call that department.  You might have to make a decision about whether this is a case that requires an emergency call.  So maybe you need to do another checklist, just to decide whether to leave a note for the neurologist in the morning, or to make an emergency call.<p>Suddenly your standardized checklist is no longer standardized across these two hospitals.<p>Multiply this by a myriad of checklist across a myriad of different medical facilities with a myriad of different differences, and suddenly the dream of a standardized set of checklists becomes impossible.<p>This does not mean that the effort of creating and following checklists is not worthwhile - it most certainly is.

I got 2.7 installed, virtualenv, even Qt but eventually a few things broke and I ended up switching to programming in a Linux VM.<p>I might have another go now I've got a shiny new Mini with ML on it. If i have problems I'll give Enthought a try.<p>Given the popularity of OSX with developers it's shocking how few Python libraries have good OSX binary packages. A few times I've found the easiest platform to work on is actually Windows. For example with PySide for a long time the binaries in all the Linux repos were out of date, OSX support was intermittently flaky, but the Windows installer was complete and up to date.<p>Yes I know you can compile from source, but I am a Python programmer. I develop software in Python, not C. I wonder if the poor state of binary packages for OSX is actually because it's a Unix variant. i.e. module developers deliberately choose not to do binary OSX builds because hey, the users can just compile from source. No, we can't all compile from source. We're not all C hackers, that's why many of us use Python in the first place. </entitled rant>",1355335048

As Roughdraft's Peter Boyce pointed out, young founders need less and less funding to get started.<p>This whole thing reminds me of the recruiting craze in the NBA. Remember when guys like KG really drove the trend of skipping college and going straight to the NBA? Recruiters started looking earlier and earlier to find the best talent. When I was like 14 I remember starting to see SLAM magazine articles about the best middle school players in the country. Recruiters tried to befriend the most talented earlier and earlier.<p>This is what the recent news of Roughdraft.VC and Dorm Room Fund remind me of... VC's trying to find founders who aren't looking for funding <i>and</i> maybe haven't founded something yet. And the best way to find them? The students on campus who are the most helpful and have built the most trust with these ""about-to-be-founders"".<p>That LITERALLY is the definition of Peter Boyce.<p>For those who don't know the story of Boyce, he is the essence of everything startups at Harvard.

Having worked on this problem around the year 2000 in the Norwegian health care system and also in the public sector you'll quickly find that funnily enough doctors don't agree on what is the ""best"" procedure most of the time. Even in Norway where they register every single cancer patient, treatment and outcome it's hard to make up completely standardized treatments for cancer and that's just a single disease. Most countries don't have anything close to that.<p>What could be damn useful however is good old fashion infection checklists. Since the time of Joseph Lister there have barely been any progress in infection control at hospitals. One might even say there has been a substantial regression.

4911464,comment,4904722,4905925,1,0,sageikosa,,,"I also mention that this is how a government built on a system of justice works, I do not claim to place that moniker ""de facto"" on any particular government (in whole or in part).<p>Rights don't come from the state, they are a consequence of individuals needing to be able to act upon long range plans while interacting with others, and to be assured that values they have acquired will still be at their disposal in the future.  One only needs rights to things one plans to use when other potential users may contend for it.  Relying on a social order that defends rights is in one's best long-range interests.<p>Laws that define and penalize ""anti-competitive"" behavior are orthogonal to capitalism, in that capitalism isn't about competition, it is about investment and return.  From a legal standpoint (principles of justice notwithstanding), the remedy for anti-trust behavior is rationalized not as a complete termination of property rights (destruction or redistribution), but commands to take or cease action (interference) to compensate ""injured parties"", or forced reorganization to hinder the offending activity from recurring.  Nominally the property still exists with its owner(s), although it has become encumbered or splintered into multiple properties.<p>The ability for a government to own and acquire real estate puts it at odds with (perhaps) its chief purpose, defense of the property of the citizens, especially when it gives itself the coercive power to grab when all else fails.<p>Suspension of rights in times of war is why we are warned about the rise of the total state under conditions of total war.  The ""war on terror"" is the current excuse for the non-defense of many rights, not just property.",1355334813
4911463,comment,4911204,4911204,3,0,davecap1,,,"One of the main issues here is that medical care is largely non-procedural and intuition-based. That's why doctors have to spend years doing training, followed by years of experience. Their ""checklists"" are created one step at a time, per-patient.<p>This is exactly what needs to be changed in order to disrupt healthcare. Once medical care becomes procedural (ie generated by smart software, per patient, based on the patient's electronic health record which includes genomic and molecular data), we can begin replacing highly specialized doctors with non-specialized ones (and eventually with nurses).  Of course, there are probably tons of areas where ""simpler"" checklists can be made to have a significant impact on outcomes (for example making sure the right patient gets the right drugs, etc..).<p>Clay Christensen's book, Innovator's Prescription, goes into a lot of detail about how this will most likely play out:\n<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Prescription-Disruptive-Solution-Health/dp/0071592083"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Prescription-Disruptive-Sol...</a>",1355334812

Every university takes a hard line on cheating (or at least, wants to be perceived that way), and all other things being equal they will side with their faculty over their students. So no, I doubt very seriously that ""due process"" at the university level is going to require harder evidence than this, until the student is thrown out of the school and dad's lawyer decides to sue, and even then it won't be hard to materialize a contract signed by the student at matriculation that alleviates the university of any kind of obligation to be fair about these kinds of punishments.<p>The likelihood of a student being ""framed"" is a lot lower than the likelihood of the student just being stupid and expecting not to get caught. When bringing this up before the university ethics board the student will have to do more than argue that anybody could have registered under their name. There will probably need to be some proof that somebody else did it. If you think otherwise, wait until you or somebody you know winds up on the wrong side of a university ethics panel. You'd be surprised how very little it takes to get in trouble and how difficult it can be to get out of trouble. A friend of mine got brought before an ethics panel for hacking, by simply sending the IT staff an email about a page with a vulnerability. Nothing was exploited and nobody was told about it except one person in the IT department. It took five profs arguing against the absurdity of the proceedings to get the sentence reduced from being kicked out to ""just"" one semester of probation.<p>In short, the prof doesn't need the confession. The student would be wise to write one and play up that this is their first time cheating. Trying to fight this like a legal battle will only make the school that much more eager to kick the student out.",1355334342

Obviously they are aimed at the savvy but it's reliable, cheap while being easy to estimate costs, simple to configure and expand, pretty good documentation, plus it doesn't have the learning curve or linguistic peculiarities of Amazon.<p>Regarding Rackspace, I've had good experience with them when working at mid-size and larger companies. Unfortunately I've had the opposite experience when functioning as a freelancer, working with startups, or as an entrepreneur myself. Rackspace didn't even respond to sales inquiries. Initially I figured this was a strangely repeated fluke, but other small companies and entrepreneurs I've spoken to have reported the exact same thing, where they send an inquiry to Rackspace or ask to speak with a sales engineer, and they get no response. Nothing, zip, nada. I find that very strange, and am speculating RS no longer wants to deal with the growing pains and frequent support requests of startups, but it certainly makes the decision to stick with Linode or EC2 much easier.<p>I don't have much experience with dedicated anymore, but have repeatedly heard good things about ServInt and SingleHop.

For $50 I get 10mbit/s @ 95% (basically, burstable to 100mbps for up to 5% of a month). That's about 3 TB of data transfer which alone would cost  hundreds of dollars at EC2. Of course, it is also way more data than most people would use.<p>The server I bought used on eBay for $365. Its a dual Xeon L5420 (8 hw cores) and has 24 GB of RAM. I run seven or 8 VMs under KVM on it presently. These images are pretty portable and a couple of them I backup regularly to S3; I could recover to an EC2 instance if I lost the box.<p>I monitor this with an EC2 micro instance and have not had any network outages in 6 months there. If I wanted to run a production site there I would need at least a second machine for redundancy; that would be another $30-40 a month. I'd probably also replicate real-time to a small EC2 instance so that would cost a little (though the incoming B/W to EC2 is free) - I don't do that now as I don't have real ""production"" data.<p>Not everyone should do this but if you like servers you should consider it. Another advantage here is that I own the server. If I get in a billing dispute or other issue with my provider they can take me off the network but they cannot hold my server hostage. Also they cannot login to the box - any attempt at social hacking is pretty well doomed.<p>On the other hand, on the two occaisions I've needed remote hands and the one time I needed a KVM they responded in less than fifteen minutes. It is mind-blowing the level of support you can get with the right provider.",1355333904

It provides the incentive for the server to do their job well, providing the best service possible to the customer.  Especially in situations where the server can materially affect the quality: you might get a beer glass full of foam, or a mixed drink very thin on the alcohol, or a cabbie who takes the wrong route and gets lost, or a bellhop who drops your bag.  Tipping provides direct connection between these and the compensation earned by the server, incenting the servers to deliver well.<p>There are flaws with the above argument.  If there's sufficient supervision by the employer as to quality of service (think flight attendants, or fast food where the manager is always nearby), tipping isn't necessary.

I find that idea (personally) distasteful, but don't have any better ideas besides getting donations.<p>Maybe this exists, MediaWiki may even support it. What I'd like to see is a wiki that allowed you to populate articles by crossreferencing other pages.<p>An example:<p><pre><code>  Page: Lisp <tagged as FP>\n  A functional programming language invented in...\n  <Portion marked as summary>\n\n  Page: Functional Programming\n  <Summary of FP>\n  List of languages in the FP category:\n  <Populated from tagged articles>\n    <Populated from summary in tagged articles>\n</code></pre>\nYou'd only edit that Lisp summary in one location, then other articles could pull from it as needed. Not sure how well it'd work in practice, and as I said maybe MediaWiki and others support this now. I haven't looked at their features in years.<p>If you initially constructed your wiki from Wikipedia (and maybe other sources), the initial effort would be on removing this redundancy, but you'd still provide as many articles they'd just be better synchronized with each other. Adding breadth (Scheme, Common Lisp, etc) would be straightforward by sharing whole blocks of text. Shorter articles wouldn't be penalized because they'd just be pulled into others via this same cross referencing mechanism. They could be hidden in some fashion to avoid namespace clutter, but outright deletion would be unnecessary.<p>Well that was a braindump, and maybe not as coherent as I thought it would be. This is why I should sleep more, and practice describing my ideas to other people for feedback.<p>EDIT: To continue, a thought I should've included originally, use some form of markup for those pages to autofill parts and maybe autogenerate the summary. A language has a place, person and time of invention. A set of paradigms it may be described as fitting into, a set of parent, children and cousin languages. Marked up, this allows for portions to be very consistent in presentation across pages in a category. I suppose I should look at semantic wikis again. As I said, this was an idea I had years ago and pondered but never really researched.<p>EDIT: Missing newlines.",1355332543

If the drift is slow - which thermally induced drift usually is, because it's driven by daily heating/cooling cycles - then it's possible to correct for it in the recording. Analysis techniques which are based on frequency-domain variations would tend to reject this type of slow drift automatically, but the details depend on the technique used. If, on the other hand, the noise on the clock is fast jitter rather than slow drift, things become much more difficult. On typical consumer recording devices, the noise floor due to jitter is way below the noise floor due to the limited SNR of the microphones and amplifiers used. The jitter noise is non-linear, which makes things harder, but doesn't tend to be a limiting factor.<p>It's been most of a decade since I worked on this stuff (in the context of radar and sonar), so that knowledge may be out of date. Still, I'd be surprised if clock (LO) jitter is the limiting factor in this type of analysis.",1355332290

I'd be tempted to pay $80 for the book, all seven interviews, and the case study+bonus content. And, since I've touched on it, I'm kind've taken aback that 4 sections of the book were cut and added as an up sell; that just doesn't sit well with me. But even at $80, I'd expect a lot more quality in the interviews than I'd seen before; being unable to see some shorts, and basing my experience only on the freeview through the newsletter, I still wouldn't buy.<p>I hope, for the sake of the energy you've spent on this project, that I'm totally alien in the way I feel about your product. I hate to be disheartening or seem like I'm just playing devil's advocate to the positive reception you've had so far, that really isn't my intention.<p>Just to touch on your comment of ""standard ebook prices"" -- $30 is pretty standard. But when I pay that, I'm usually buying Manning or O'Reilly; getting early(beta) access and post-launch updates/errata. Also, I'm usually being written to by a community leader. I'm not trying to shoot down your integrity, but the people who write $30 ebooks tend to have significantly more provenance than yourself.<p>Wishing you success, thanks for the reply.",1355331991

If you can't do this, then you don't understand how to test for knowledge<p>Possible counterexample:  The absolute best math professor (in terms of success educating, not how fun his classes were) I had was legendary for his exams.  They usually only had a couple questions.  But 3 hours were allotted to take them - not as take-home exams; he would arrange special evening test sessions.  Everyone did the test on a computer in Mathematica. Internet access was not available.  Mathematica was necessary; the questions were designed to reflect real-life problems someone in a math-related field might be asked to solve, and like in the real world the nature of the problem was such that doing the actual calculation by hand would not have been practical.<p>We really needed that time to figure out how to solve the problems.  And I think there's no way the professor could have managed exams that tested our knowledge as deeply without creating problems that required that kind of time to solve.<p>That said, I agree that take-home exams are problematic.  As an option for trying to come up with exams that ask students to think rather than just regurgitating knowledge, I think they might once have been quite effective.

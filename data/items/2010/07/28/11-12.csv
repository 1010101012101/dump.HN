And even iTunes as a ""music manager"" didn't arrive on windows till later on. Was Microsoft even pushing a device OS at this point? Apple's was very bare bones and device specific and I would assume all the competitors had similar code for their hardware with very little but the PlaysForSure DRM being shared between devices.<p>I thought the iPod succeeded because Sony were being arrogant and expecting everyone to transcode to ATRAC, Microsoft were being arrogant and expecting everyone to transcode to WMA and both seemed keen on putting DRM even on CDs you ripped yourself.<p>Apple supported mp3s which had already got the seal of approval from digital pirates and let you freely rip CDs in a way that wouldn't delete your collection if you upgraded your machine. They also had widespread Firewire in the days before USB 2 so you could fill the drive in a reasonable time frame. I can't count how many firewire cards I fitted to friends and colleagues PCs when they were following me onto the iPod bandwagon.<p>Fundamentally if you can't execute then it doesn't really matter what you're strategy is. I don't see how jumping from one poorly executed strategy to a 2nd hand strategy from Apple is going to help unless you can deliver on it.",1280317142

Something reflecting that fact that the US domestic market is waning in importance would be more accurate (but less provocative from an editor's POV).<p>The EU, taken as a single market, is the largest global market in terms of sheer spending power - it has a bigger population than the US (half a billion plus, vs. 307 million in the US). China is growing rapidly, but is still a very poor country currently. Of course, you cannot treat the EU as a single market in practical terms, because of language differences (even within the same country e.g. Switzerland), different laws and customs. The US, by comparison, is a far more homogenous unit (easier to sell into from a startups' perspective, European startups probably have to go international from day one, which is a big drawback from doing a startup in Europe).<p>I certainly don't think the American people are becoming obsolete - the world is still very US-centric, for better or worse.

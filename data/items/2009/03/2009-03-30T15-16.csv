Basically, I see relational databases as especially useful for cases where you have a big pile of data, and have no idea what it really means.  You do queries to learn what you have.  (""Aha, in March, people from Illinois buy more of product 23894735 than people from California."")  The relational model is good for this, since it doesn't build any preconceived notions into your data.<p>However, most applications don't need anything like this.  They have a well-defined data-model, and rarely run ""queries"" (except to work around the fact that that's the only interface to their data).  In this case, the relational model is basically being used as a dumb key/value store supplemented with joins.  This results in a ton of code in the application to translate in-memory structures to something that can be stored in the database.<p>If you use a graph database, you can just store your in-memory structures directly, and get them back later.  (Most good object database give you other features, like the ability to index your data so you can still run searches efficiently.  Kioku and Elephant do this, anyway.)<p>So really, you should use the right tool for the job.  Want to persist and search in-memory structures?  Use an object database.  Have a big pile of data you need to make sense of?  Use a relational database.<p>You are allowed to use more than one, they are tools, not religions.<p>(FWIW, I see relational databases as filling a very specialized role, and I see object databases as the general thing you should use when you want to persist some state.  The rest of the world seems to have gotten this backwards, which is somewhat depressing.  I think it's because people think databases are magical, as a result of not understanding how they actually work.)",1238426204

Could an Aussie please explain this phenomenon to me?<p>We have two separate elections - one for the house of representatives, and one for the senate. In both cases, we do preferential voting.<p>For the house of representatives, you have maybe five or six parties running in your electorate, each with one candidate. Filling out preferences for this is feisable, and plenty of people do. It takes about ten seconds.<p>For the senate... not so much.<p>This year, the senate election in New South Wales has 110 candidates. You can either provide a single vote for one party (your preferences will be distributed according to whatever deals that part has made), or you can individually rank all 110 senate candidates. The ballot paper is a meter wide. Oh, and the desks you use are typically wide enough to fit an A4 sheet of paper.<p>Nobody bothers. It&#x27;s just way too much hassle.",1377082356

They probably didn&#x27;t start out with the plan to implement a programming language with xml tags, but they did. It&#x27;s horrible.<p>Edit: XML Schema is horrible as well. This is how you define an element with string content, and one attribute (which is VERY basic):<p><pre><code>  <xs:element name=&quot;myElement&quot;>\n    <xs:complexType>\n      <xs:simpleContent>\n        <xs:extension base=&quot;xs:string&quot;>\n          <xs:attribute name=&quot;myAttribute&quot; type=&quot;xs:string&quot; />\n        </xs:extension>\n      </xs:simpleContent>\n    </xs:complexType>\n  </xs:element>\n</code></pre>\nJust off the top of my head, I could invent something better, like:<p><pre><code>  <myElement myAttribute=&quot;xs:string&quot;>xs:string</myElement></code></pre>",1377082079

If it was earlier than 2002 it is probably as you say, run of the mill lying to the SEC.<p>His allegations are of retaliation, that he was given cruel and unusual attention because he refused to comply.\nAs regards whether it was retaliation, his credibility is shot.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt that the meetings occurred, that qwest refused and that contracts were cancelled.

Plenty are trying to create viable businesses.<p>The difference between Google and the serious startups is that they have a record of launching products with no plan or intention to make money from them: they are loss leaders to bring more people into the Google walled garden. A lot of people didn&#x27;t realise that in the past. People used these product knowing they weren&#x27;t a money earner for Google, but people assumed Google was tying to be a good citizen and provide useful services for people. Using up the piles of money sloshing around at Google. People treat(ed) things like reader or gmail as basic infrastructure. Google enjoyed being treated like the benevolent dictator of the internet. We paid our &#x27;taxes&#x27; in the form of ads and in return got lots of services and infrastructure for free. I heard countless people making the argument that Google&#x27;s interests were intrinsically aligned with those of internet users: there was no way that giving more money and power to Google could ever go wrong.<p>It was totally wrong for people to think that way: corporations do not operate in the public interest.

Just as in the US, each electoral district (there are 150) elects a single member to the HoR, whereas each state elects multiple members to the Senate.  In the case of the Senate though, each state is treated as one giant electoral district with proportional representation.<p>Both the HoR and Senate elections use single-transferable-vote (&quot;instant runoff&quot;), but this obviously plays out very differently in single-member electoral districts versus multi-member proportional districts.<p>HoR ballots tend to have a reasonably small number of candidates - between 3 and about 15, but usually somewhere nearer to 6.  On these ballots, a full preferential ballot is the only option - you must number all candidates in order for your vote to count.<p>Senate ballots, however, are ballooning somewhat out-of-control.  At the upcoming election, the Senate ballot paper in NSW will have 110 candidates.  Requiring voters to number all of these squares for their vote to count was causing the informal ballot count to increase substantially, so in the 1980s &quot;above the line&quot; voting was introduced.  Under above-the-line voting, you can simply indicate a vote for your preferred party ticket, and your full preferences will be allocated according to the ticket that the party submitted to the electoral commission prior to voting.  These preference tickets are publically available, and the current controversy surrounds the party tickets lodged by Wikileaks in some states.  &quot;Below the line&quot; voting is still available as an option (and obviously one I personally will be taking up).<p>There is growing recognition of the perverse results that &quot;above the line&quot; voting can cause, and of course 1-metre-wide ballot papers with over 100 candidates listed are absurd.  There is some talk of allowing &quot;optional preferential voting&quot; above the line, so that you can just number the party tickets in your preferred order, rather than having to either number every single candidate individually, or accept your preferred party&#x27;s direction of preferences in its entireity.",1377080729

Even then, even without access to the direct data, the traits expressed <i>COULD</i> still accidentally identify certain members of the set very easily.<p>How many albinos are in the set? How many male albinos? How many male albinos with blood type O positive? Oh look, it&#x27;s Joe and it turns out he&#x27;s a carrier for this other embarrassing genotype. Whoops, secret&#x27;s out and everyone knows, and there&#x27;s no going back!<p>So phenotypes can still identify people inadvertently, and then provide opportunities for the enumeration of members, through process of elimination, inherently weakening what might become a theater of anonymity.<p>But more terrible still, is, let&#x27;s just say they give the raw genetic data up. Say you have a juicy tidbit of information you pulled from the collection of samples, and you think you know who it is. So you surreptitiously snag a hair follicle from them. It&#x27;s them all right, and you can prove it conclusively. Maybe your a nice guy and you won&#x27;t misuse this sort of advantage, but is that true for everyone at large, throughout society?<p>With DNA, genomes and genetic evidence, you kind of just have to keep saying to yourself &quot;<i>this is not anonymizable, it will never be anonymous, we cannot truly de-identify anyone&#x27;s DNA</i>&quot; and the sooner we come to terms with that, the better we&#x27;ll get at dealing with this sort of data.",1444708705

Universities tend to have both central staff, and departmental IT staff distributed amongst them. It works in the sense that departments with larger needs can fund their own hires, but they&#x27;re often understaffed, underfunded, and report to (and are hired by) people who&#x27;s general requirements are that systems operate either long enough to submit a grant proposal, publish a paper, lecture in front of class or submit final grades.

Much of the speed increase in modern systems is not from parallelism, but forfeiting the overhead of the shell interpreter in favor of direct execution. Checkpointing can do far greater wonders for your boot times than parallelism can, anyhow.</i><p>No.  I have worked on embedded Linux systems where we have carefully charted boot time.  We were able to get order-of-magnitude improvements by parallelizing service startups during boot.  Parallelism is far from &quot;a small part&quot;-- it is the only important part.  The overhead of the shell is negligible even on the slowest systems.  Checkpointing is not an option for most things (I have mentioned this several times) because most of the startup processes initialize the hardware directly or indirectly, and hardware can&#x27;t be checkpointed.<p><i>The idea of device units is not well borne out, as I mentioned. You don&#x27;t need to create an object type out of a udev handle to order after devices or trigger hotplug events (the device node manager itself does fine, of course in the case of systemd, udev is part of the project, so...)</i><p>The important question is whether there is more or less complexity in systemd than a system with a separate device node manager.  I am not convinced that systemd is more complex than the alternative.  If the device node manager was separate, you would have to debug the interaction between the two processes.  Having dealt with debugging d-bus interactions on Linux before, it doesn&#x27;t sound fun.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced that a static dependency graph is even feasible in a world where users can reconfigure and install new services, hotplug hardware, and join and leave wireless networks.",1444708047

Have familiarized yourself with the issues surrounding the anti-development sentiment and roadblocks to new development in San Francisco? There&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> more to it than &quot;[Some] voters don&#x27;t want to increase the quantity of housing ... near them.&quot;<p>To speak directly to the Krugman quote: San Francisco&#x27;s rent control is more correctly termed rent stabilization. Rent increases are slaved to the CPI for as long as a unit is occupied. When a unit is vacated, that unit&#x27;s rent may be set to <i>any</i> rate the landlord desires. More importantly: unless special arrangements are negotiated, [0] rent stabilization does <i>not</i> apply to housing built or first occupied <i>after</i> mid-June 1979.<p>AIUI, at the time, existing landholders decided that they would make <i>much</i> more money by raising their rents to ludicrous levels than by increasing the density of the housing on their property. They could do this by taking advantage of high demand and limited supply. When most landholders <i>won&#x27;t</i> allow a developer to build on their property because they make more money by restricting the supply of housing, Krugman&#x27;s argument goes out the window.<p>Rent control and rent stabilization has <i>no</i> place in districts with healthy responses to increased demand for housing. It is a tool of <i>last</i> resort. San Francisco worked <i>hard</i> to balance the potential damage done by rent stabilization with the <i>real</i> damage done by astronomical rents. I would say that they <i>largely</i> succeeded. [1]<p>[0] As far as I know this has happened only once, with with Sangiacomo&#x27;s Trinity Place on Market street. A special arrangement was reached to destroy existing rent-controlled units at the site, but have a 1:1 replacement in the new construction. <i>All</i> other units in the building are &quot;market rate&quot; units.<p>[1] But, -in retrospect- they erred <i>too</i> far in the landlord&#x27;s favor. The &quot;Vacated units reset to market rate&quot; provision in the ordinance gives landlords <i>ample</i> incentive to harass and subtly force out long-term tenants, and -in times of radical rent inflation- behave as slumlords and neglect maintenance and upkeep. (Because, if they have a captive revenue source, why on <i>earth</i> would they spend more than the bare minimum that they can (legally or illegally) get away with to retain it?)

It is not so much that there are distinctions but that previous study and understanding is required to make the most of any art (including &quot;pop&quot; or &quot;lowbrow&quot;).<p>A guest in my house this week is a big fan of very simple techno. I&#x27;m obsessively listening to and playing through Franck&#x27;s Prelude, Chorale and Fugue after hearing Stephen Hough play parts of it at a masterclass a month ago which gave me a new understanding of and hunger for the piece. I do so with headphones because I know the sound bothers my guest. What little techno I have heard from his computer bothers ME a little because of the absolute paucity of content (I say this as someone who brought a Daft Punk track to an analysis class as a joke which turned into a 1h30 discussion on the only three elements we were able to isolate).<p>My taste has evolved from over 25 years of investing in understanding (classical) music, probably well over the 10,000 hours mark. He hasn&#x27;t invested the hours (decades) so he doesn&#x27;t appreciate the art, much or at all. And that&#x27;s fine - he appreciates other things in life, in which he has invested time, and in which I understand very little. The content of the Franck is complex and high dimensional (if that makes sense) and requires that previous body of knowledge and experience to appreciate; in fact, as someone who has never played on an organ, I am probably lacking a fair amount of experience to make the most of Franck.<p>With that body of knowledge, you are able to judge and appreciate the piece according to objective standards. Without, you get the second graders and the tasting meal (and they did like the wagyu!). Untrained listeners will react to some of the harmonies. Take the famous hand jump chords [1]. A &quot;man in the street&quot; might appreciate the familiar chord progression. A pianist will react immediately to the genius of that hand jump that forces you to isolate the &quot;melody&quot; (and perhaps shaping the arpeggiated chord that ends up &quot;naturally&quot; leading to it) due to the physics of getting to that last note. I took a friend to that masterclass and he was as bored as I was fascinated.<p>From A Mathematician&#x27;s Apology: &quot;Mr. J. M. Lomas put this point more picturesquely when we were passing the Nelson column in Trafalgar Square. If I had a statue on a column in London, would I prefer the column to be so high that the statue was invisible, or low enough for the features to be recognizable? I would choose the first alternative, Dr. Snow, presumably, the second.&quot; [2]<p>That being said I think there is value in &quot;man on the street&quot; reviews. As such a man in the case of many fields, I would like to know how others reacted as a proxy for my own reaction. There is a place for Yelp, and for Michelin. One is wealthier for reading both.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq67nsDLucI&t=5m32s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq67nsDLucI&t=5m32s</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Mathematicians-Apology-Canto-Classics/dp/110760463X/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Mathematicians-Apology-Canto-Classics/...</a>",1444707653

A large error on small is just a multiplier of small.  It&#x27;s all small.<p>When you decompose a larger task into smaller ones, that&#x27;s all still true for each of the smaller ones, right?<p>But you must remember to add the errors!  And that is precisely why overall confidence may not likely improve with decomposition vs. an aggregate, or coarse, high level estimate of the whole thing.<p>And this is true for more than software.  Why?<p>New tasks can be broken down into two coarse buckets:  done before and novel.<p>Novel things really are novel!  It&#x27;s important to recognize this case and qualify it.  Progress might look like:<p>week 1 - 10 percent done, \nweek 2 - 10 percent done, \nweek 3 - 15 percent done, \nweek 4 - 50 percent done!  Yes!,   \nweek 5 - 5 percent done... everybody take a drink, \nweek 6 - 40 percent done,<p>etc...<p>Because it&#x27;s novel, there are new dynamics in play, and even the best planning may not account for, and actually usually does not account for, things that just come up and that must be dealt with.<p>For the done before case, it&#x27;s better as a lot is known, but there are still many factors out of the team control.  Updates, changes, regressions, unfound bugs, all contribute to variance.  The more the organization completely owns, the less this may be true, but it&#x27;s always somewhat true.<p>The pragmatic person might classify everything as having some percentage of novel, and break it down into known novel and unknown, &quot;it just hit us!&quot; type novel and go from there and likely be better off when having to manage expectations.<p>Another way to think of this, depending on it being software or something else, is production vs &quot;R&D&quot; and the research and development part just isn&#x27;t cog / production like.  Time and materials estimates, if they are even given, must be considered accordingly.<p>If they are not, expectations do not match realities, and now there is a management and potentially a funding problem in addition to the primary problem needing a solution.",1444707124

I don&#x27;t mean that justifies it, but it could be very subconscious, is not specific to &quot;tech&quot;, and seems much less offensive than some of the other examples.<p>To whatever extent men adopt a different tone when talking to women, it would probably take quite a lot of conscious concentration to control, and generations to eradicate (possibly never, if they can be picked up again by watching our contemporary media.)  So, I guess it&#x27;s something to keep an eye on and fix where you can, but not so simple as eliminating stuff like &quot;They only let you work here ’cause you’re hot.&quot;<p>Edit: tl/dr: If &quot;tone&quot; meant treating her like an idiot/non-technical, bad. If it meant different pitch of voice and body language, not good per se but not that bad either.<p>P.S. Actually, maintaining gender-based differences might be desirable.  Women probably don&#x27;t want to be treated exactly like &quot;one of the guys&quot;, right?  Modifying your message and presentation based on your audience is a part of effective communication.  If it&#x27;s offending your audience, change that, but maybe it&#x27;s not a bad starting position.",1444705930

10378364,comment,10376724,10378278,0,0,vonklaus,,,"> Can you elaborate on what do you think would be the great step forward?<p>As someone with little knowledge of the field or the science involved, my ideas are largely borrowed from others much smarter than myself. Steve Jurvetson, a VC from DFJ who regularly talks about this field, engineering solutions through evolution, and Gordon Moore. Craig Venter was a fundamental force in sequencing the entire human genome this research made companies like Anne Wojcicki&#x27;s 23AndMe possible. They are the people who will likely provide the true merit of this endeavor.<p>My thoughts:<p>* Early diagnosis. This is one of the most obvious ones. With companies like theranos providing quick testing equiptment and the price of sequencing plummeting, having gentic evidence to compare for risk factors and real-time blood tests, the ability to diagnose things early would be amazing.<p>* Cures. Broadly, the ability to read, write and interpret genetic sequences would allow for personalized medicine and curing genetic illnesses one was predisposed to.<p>* Adaptation. If we were able to have access to a dataset so massive, we were able to uderstand and curate genes. Outside of basic gene therapy and medacine we could actively enhance humans. This could possibly provide electronic interface with our own wetware, the extension of life, or otherwise change aspects of the human condition that were not desirable.<p>* Creation. This is controversial, so I will leave it there.<p>There are so many ways even with current technology that would provide positive things if we had this data and the tools to analyze it. I am excited for this. Similar to AI which will bifurcate between extinction or utopia, this has quite a large upside but also some substantial negatives.",1444705697

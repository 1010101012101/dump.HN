176973,comment,176487,176898,0,0,wanorris,,,"> C++ is universally regarded as a language for large system development.<p>Actually, C++ is a <i>terrible</i> language for large system development. Far worse than Ruby. Then again, I'm not entirely convinced that Ruby is a great language for large system development, either: monkeypatching in a 50-developer project = teh evil. Of course, you can at least solve the worst problems with Ruby with coding standards. C++ problems are more fundamental.<p>> My heresy is that static type checking is white elephant. I've been doing this kind of work for going on 15 years now, and I can count on 1 hand the number of head-scratching bugs I've had due to type safety, and that includes 100kloc+ components built entirely around void* closures. The things that really fuck you in large systems are object lifecycle and concurrency.<p>If you use a powerful static type system (i.e. neither Java's nor C#'s) intelligently, you can sidestep whole categories of problems simply with proper type declarations -- for example, by using different types for escaped and unescaped string data from users.<p>In any case, the real reason that enterprises are more comfortable with Java and .Net than dynamic languages for major projects isn't speed, it's that the deployment and monitoring infrastructure is mature and well-understood. Obviously, many enormous websites have been deployed on dynamic languages, but enterprises have a much higher comfort level with the tools available for Java and .Net than the tools for doing this with Ruby, et alia. That's why you see a lot more enterprise traction for solutions like JRuby -- problem solved, as far as they're concerned.",1209501993

I bought the one I still have from the Arthur Andersen auction after the Enron scandal shut them down...got it for $385.  I also got a truly awesome Keilhauer chair for $35 (list price ~$950, but everybody was after the Aerons, so the other chairs went for nothing, even though most were really nice chairs), which I also kept.  Maybe Aerons come down in price in the past two years, or are cheaper here in the valley, I dunno.<p>But I agree, spending a few grand on every new employee for a nice working environment, the keyboard they like, a great chair, a good desk, a nice top of the line computer with dual monitors, is just sound business sense.  The money spent will disappear into noise by the time you add their annual salary to their line on your expense report.  And the work environment will last for years, just upgrade the computer every 18-24 months, and the monitors every 3 years, and you've got a fat and sassy employee that feels like you appreciate them (assuming you actually do appreciate them and treat them with respect in addition to giving them great tools with which to work).  And the chair is the single most important part of that equation.  I'd never ask anyone to sit 8 hours in a crappy chair.",1209501699

It is the way it is. Human interests, interaction, history and habits are stronger than any amateur Marxist can imagine.<p>You think world is unfair? Probably. However, the pathetic attempts to seek high moral ground are futile. You have seen how One Laptop Per Child faired in real life. You should also remember that there are tons and tons of <i>used</i> computer equipment and especially mobile phones imported into Africa and other poor countries every day. This used equipment is imported for money and put to use immediately. Some of this technology is affecting how farmers in distant African villages are managing their harvest sales, for example.<p>This is globalisation. It may sound humiliating (used clothes, used phones etc) but it is wonderful, vibrant, living global economic organism which will show some interesting emergent qualities in our lifetime. Who would imagine South East Asia growing the way it does today?<p>You may see some surprises from Africa too. And no, it would be not because some guilt-ridden guy has shown us, the masses, what to do. Some of the worst damage to third world economies are done by Western donors.<p>So, basically, my advice to the author: stop preaching the need to change this cruel world and go make something that people want to buy.",1209500539

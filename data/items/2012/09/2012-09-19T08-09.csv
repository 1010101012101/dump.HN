Also a couple of weeks after quitting regular usage I felt rather down and depressed, obviously due to the mess MDMA creates in the serotonin/dopamin system. For other effects: there are quite a lot of studies on them, and none of them are particularly good news.

It was motivated by the fact that we found it increasingly hard to cope with the steady growth of users and traffic, resulting in serious slowdowns of the system and in some cases even downtime.<p>The majority of Toggl program code originated from the time when our user base was 10x smaller, so the system needed a major overhaul. There were also several functional shortcomings, for example entries were not refreshed automatically when changes were made elsewhere (e.g. mobile phone). Also we had no offline support of any kind on the web.<p>Our situation in May this year<p>It took 5-7 seconds to load a time tracking page in Toggl, quite often even up to 20 seconds and more. Most of the time was spent by the server to compile the necessary dataset of time entries, but also related data.
The whole backend was based on Ruby on Rails, we used Ruby 1.8 at that time.
User interface could not be used offline.
Javascript code was bloated and contained a lot of unnecessary code (for example we had multiple date parsing/formatting libraries, etc)
The loading and parsing of Javascript started to block our UI because of its size.
Backend API calls were not optimized for the purpose, we requested too much data which strained both the database and bandwidth.
New implementation<p>After careful consideration we decided to re-use the offline-enabled time tracking code that is also used in our mobile apps and in Toggl Desktop, only retaining the visual of the existing time tracking page. So basically we decided to replace the whole backend code of that page.<p>We had run some experiments with the Go programming language (<a href=""http://golang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/</a>) before, and decided that we should re-implement some parts of our backend with this new platform. So far, it has paid off, as the development process was fast, and deployment surprisingly simple. The resulting code is a big improvement in terms of speed. Well continue to replace our backend code with Go.<p>Secondly we implemented a Redis-backed (<a href=""http://redis.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redis.io/</a>) WebSocket server in Go to enable realtime synchronization between different Toggl clients  so your time entries, projects etc. would be updated automatically if you use Toggl on multiple devices.<p>Thirdly we added HTML5 manifest and local storage to support offline usage of Toggl. This served also as the speed enabler. Offline was already implemented with our mobile interface m.toggl.com, so we reused a lot of that.<p>In frontend Javascript code, were moving to Backbone.js (<a href=""http://backbonejs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://backbonejs.org/</a>). As the amount of Javascript code is increasing fast, this library enables to structure it better. For parsing, formatting and manipulating dates in Javascript, weve moved to Moment.js (<a href=""http://momentjs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://momentjs.com/</a>) It has simplified our code a lot.<p>Following Google Page Speed (<a href=""https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/</a>) tips, weve started to use a Javascript loader to reduce resource blocking. At the moment, were using LABjs (<a href=""http://labjs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://labjs.com/</a>).<p>Another update we made was to upgrade to Ruby 1.9. The upgrade gave the system another speed boost.<p>Finally we spent time measuring HTML/CSS/JS load times and optimizing the milliseconds there. Our goal was to get the load time to under 1 second, or even faster. While the tracking page now loads faster, its still a work in progress as were doing too many API requests when loading the timer. Also, were still using Javascript libraries that are quite bloated  for example for the sidebar report charts.<p>We still like Ruby on Rails a lot, and at the moment, will continue using it for serving user interface. Go will be used together with PostgreSQL and Redis for backend data crunching and efficient API calls.<p>Incremental launch<p>These changes encompassed several risks, as there were a lot of potential critical bugs associated. Thats why we decided to roll the update out incrementally. We started in early July, and slowly and cautiously added new users until we had approximately 10% using it. This amount of users gave us enough feedback on system stability and bugs. After 4 weeks it had stabilized enough to start rolling it out more aggressively. By now all users have been converted to the new version.<p>As mentioned before, speed is an important feature in Toggl. Robustness and speed is something you, our users, keep telling us if we ask what are the most important things you need from Toggl. We have gained some valuable lessons with the latest upgrade, and will continue implementing those also in other parts of Toggl.",1348043794

You might be similiar, if that's the case, then try to set your max hours at 4 hrs per day for client work and then set your rates accordingly.<p>If you find yourself working insane hours because you are getting a lot of demand, then raise your rates.<p>If you find yourself having to work insane hours because you need that many hours to pay your bills, then raise your rates.<p>That's the secret of being happy as a self employed developer. The less hours you work, the more productive you can be for those hours and the easier it is to stay disciplined. Otherwise you just become a overwhelmed, burnt out, procrastinating mess.<p>Imagine disappearing into a coding loop at around 8:00 AM and then emerging with a ton of stuff done at around noon. You have the entire rest of the day to do whatever you like and you were probably more productive than an employee chained to a desk for four hours.<p>An office is great for a change of scenery, but it's tough to justify the extra expense. Better to get out to co-working spaces or similar for that change of scenery. That means you are going to be working from home at least part of the time. Setup a desk in a quiet area which you only use for work. Don't use it for browsing, personal use, games, etc. Only for work. If you want to do personal stuff, then grab a tablet and step away from the work computer. When you are done for the day, then shut the computer off and forget about it until the next day.<p>As an entrepreneur, you should be spending some time working on business strategies. Take some time for some fun stuff which could also make you some money on the side. After your four hour grind, perhaps you can kick back a bit and work at a slower pace on alternative income streams. Make progress every day, but don't allow the side project to drain you (which will then affect your client work.) Rather, the side project should invigorate you. Hopefully it will also bring in enough extra money so that you aren't 100% reliant on client work and perhaps even allow you to further reduce the time you have to spend doing that work.<p>Not all of these are practical for all situations. Sometimes you just can't get away with only doing 4 hours per day of client work. Sometimes the client demands more time than that. Sometimes you have to work longer for financial needs.

4542631,comment,4539251,4540254,2,0,loup-vaillant,,,"Oops.<p>To answer your question, that particular situation would be better in any language that forces you to explicit the reference to ""this"" (or ""self"").  Imagine how we could modify C++:<p><pre><code>  void member_function() {
    int local_variable++;
    local_variable++;        // This is okay
    member_variable++;       // That should not be allowed
    this->member_variable++; // This should be written instead
  }
</code></pre>
Applied to the example in the GGP above:<p><pre><code>  void load(Assets* a) {
    for (int j=0; j<this->m_numAssets; j++) {
      loadAsset(a[j]);
      this->m_numLoadedAssets++;
    }
  }
</code></pre>
We see that every non-local access is prefixed by something (""this->"" and ""a["" here).  The heavier syntax suggests a heavier cost, so the programmer will more easily think of hoisting those out of the loop, if possible (either manually or through compiler optimizations).",1348041818

There are dozens of other use cases for a mobile internet client. I like to surf and read, in both cases I cherish the big display of my Galaxy Nexus (which still fits nicely into my trouser pockets, thank you very much).<p>Personally I have never typed with a thumb, and I was surprised to discover that some people actually do that.<p>Even if you are convinced typing with your thumb is your main desire in life, there are people with thumbs of different sizes. What if my thumb is 3.7 inches, not 3.5 inches. Apple would be stealing 0.2 inches from my optimal screen estate then, just to please the masses. Or what if my thumb is only 3.0 inches? No thumb typing for me :-(<p>What I am saying: yes, the 3.5 iPhone screen size may by just right - for a selected group of users with specific use cases and specific thumb sizes.

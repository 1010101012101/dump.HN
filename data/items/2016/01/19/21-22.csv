The book describes legacy code as any code without tests.<p>It then goes on to describe the &quot;legacy software change algorithm&quot; (google that for more articles that will help you.\nGet targeted legacy code into test harness and cover with tests:\n1. Identify change points for the target change or new code addition.\n  a. Find test points where the behavior of the code can be sensed.\n  b. Break dependencies (very carefully and often without sufficient tests) and get the targeted legacy code into a test harness.\n  c. Cover targeted legacy code with (characterization) unit tests\n2. Add new functionality with Test Driven Development (TDD)\n3. Refactor to remove duplication, clean up, etc.<p>It really is worth reading this book as it covers almost exactly your question: &quot;22. I Need To Change a Monster Method and I Can’t Write Tests for It.&quot; and various other relevant chapters.<p>Answering your manager question with a standard consultant answer &quot;It depends&quot;. Refactoring code is about setting yourself up for future development. You should always be refactoring your code after you confirm it works. Asking your manager whether you do it should take on the same amount of importance as asking whether you should wash your hands after visiting the restroom. That said, developers can often feel a sense of ownership of code and not wish change for various reason (usually familiarity with the current crap situation).",1453240792

Of course people online will disagree about contentious ideas, that doesn&#x27;t automatically make it a &quot;flamewar topic&quot; as you seem to think, unless you plan to flag and remove all impassioned speech here.<p>Typically for forum moderation, flamewars involve a slew of personal attacks, which are simply not present in my quote.  I said something ideologically controversial, but I didn&#x27;t flame or personally attack anyone.<p>My statement also wasn&#x27;t casual.  Since the BLM movement was founded on the Michael Brown case, I&#x27;ve put a fair amount of time and consideration into an analysis of what happened in the case and how I should feel about it and the ongoing protests -- protests that shut down the freeway here in SF for hours yesterday, I might add.<p>My overall conclusion is as stated, and that directly relates to the initial post about empathy online -- it&#x27;s an completely valid example where displaying a lack of empathy on a given subject is very controversial, which you have certainly reaffirmed here.  To you, it&#x27;s such a controversial (read: not politically correct) opinion (to refuse to show empathy towards a perceived victim) that you, as a moderator, felt the need to denigrate the perspective and flag the comment as off-topic (which it wasn&#x27;t).<p>>Tedious ideological posturing<p>I suppose you&#x27;re entitled to your opinion, and for what it&#x27;s worth you&#x27;ve labeled this quote more accurately, but it&#x27;s still extremely subjective (bordering on facile name-calling) to label what I said that way. What you find tedious others might find empowering, in that they don&#x27;t have to put the world&#x27;s problems on their shoulders and feel sad about every victim narrative bandied about on the news.  Or people could have a slew of other emotions.<p>I feel like you&#x27;re 100% okay with ideological posturing when it&#x27;s politically correct and aligns with your worldview, and 100% not okay with it when is is misaligned with your worldview.  That&#x27;s the definition of bias.  You also tend to resort to tone policing to justify acting on your biases when any argument rubs you the wrong way.  That&#x27;s not good moderation, imo.<p>Removing personal attacks is fine, sure.  Calling anything you don&#x27;t like &quot;tedious&quot; or &quot;acrimonious&quot; and then flagging and removing it -- that&#x27;s disappointing to see on HN.  Especially when PG has written articles specifically about how much he dislikes tone policing.",1453240232

How does it affect long-term maintenance, refactoring, adding features, and fixing bugs?<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure how to answer that question, but I&#x27;m not convinced that controlled studies will point to an answer.<p>It might be interesting to look at corporate metadata and try to find how how much companies spend over the lifecycle of an application on the whole development and maintenance of a project.

I&#x27;ve seen Python web systems that are an absolute nightmare to work on and reason about.<p>Probably most people here have experiences going both ways with different type systems.

At the time C was &quot;designed,&quot; this wasn&#x27;t necessarily known to be important. We have no excuse today. But languages which do this wrong by default are still popular.<p>> In Haskell, it&#x27;s very common to avoid exporting value constructors for data types, and to instead provide helper functions that allow for the implementations to remain hidden from anyone using the module.<p>In general, if calls require knowledge of type information at the call site, and the type needs to change for any reason (which becomes more likely as type annotation reaches further into program semantics) then all the call sites will need to be updated, or there will be an error.\nIn any published library, this means backward compatibility is completely broken and everyone else&#x27;s code needs to change.<p>This is a misdesign in C and in a number of &quot;statically typed&quot; languages which crib from it.<p>> you&#x27;ll see a huge block of assert statements right at the top of a function definition,<p>I almost never see this.

10934141,comment,10933524,10934134,0,0,p4wnc6,,,"continued ...<p>> Static types are also anti-modular. You have some library that exports say a Person (name, age ..). Any code that uses that data needs to see the definition for Person. They’re now tightly coupled. I’m probably not explaining this point well. Watch the video around 48:20.<p>This seems just wrong to me. You can declare structs as static in C and provide public helper functions that internally create data types, apply other static functions to them, and the produce results from them. In Haskell, it&#x27;s very common to avoid exporting value constructors for data types, and to instead provide helper functions that allow for the implementations to remain hidden from anyone using the module. Modularity really has nothing at all to do with the dynamic vs. static typing debate.<p>I&#x27;ll also throw one more downside of dynamic typing into the ring -- you sometimes will see really poor attempts to use so-called &quot;defensive programming.&quot; In Python this is an especially bad code smell -- you&#x27;ll see a huge block of assert statements right at the top of a function definition, in which all kinds of type properties and invariants of the arguments are asserted, so that TypeError can be raised immediately.<p>For one, in a dynamic typing setting, it&#x27;s probably better if that stuff is the burden of the caller rather than the callee, in the spirit of a function &quot;doing one thing and doing it well&quot; it shouldn&#x27;t also have to carry around all of its own type and invariant assertions. Notice that in a static language though, this isn&#x27;t a problem and even is a huge benefit because it doesn&#x27;t require the huge, human-error-laden block of asserts to achieve it. Just a nice, simple static typing annotation and then the <i>compiler</i> will deal with it.<p>Related to this, and as a final point, we should also need to give more &quot;severity&quot; to dynamic typing exceptions that occur at run time due to type errors. For example, in the financial job I mentioned before, it would be common place for an analyst to submit a very large batch processing job to the internal job manager. Some of these jobs took > 48 hours to compute and the output would mutate databases and so on.<p>So when someone set it running on Friday evening and expected there to be results in a database on Monday, imagine how awful it was to see that a TypeError had occurred and that not only did your manually created assertions fail to capture it, but also, there was no way of proving it couldn&#x27;t happen without just running your code -- so you burnt maybe 30 hours of computational effort just to be told that upon hitting a certain point in the code, here&#x27;s a TypeError.<p>This kind of error, which is categorically eliminated from possibility in a well-written static language program, should count for way, way more than a simple and stupid &quot;oh I tried to call the API function with a list instead of a tuple, whoops my bad, let me just arrow-up in IPython and do it again&quot; Type Error (though it&#x27;s not clear to me that several of the referenced data in the post would make this distinction or penalize these types of errors more).",1453238484

10934134,comment,10933524,10933524,0,0,p4wnc6,,,"> This first slide is from a research paper where the researcher wrote his own language and make both a statically typed and dynamically typed version then got a bunch of people to solve programming problems in it. The results were that the people using the dynamic version of the language got stuff done much quicker.<p>Does this first plot control for notions of quality and extensibility of the different solutions? A faster-to-develop but sloppier solution in a dynamic language which requires more painful investment to refactor for future use cases should not necessarily be viewed as better. If you are only saving short term time at the expense of much more long-term time, then whether it is a net win for you depends on your discount function.<p>> What was most interesting was that he tracked how much time was spent debugging type errors. In other words errors that the statically typed language would have caught. What he found was it took less time to find those errors than it did to write the type safe code in the first place.<p>For which developers, and with what level of experience with static typing? This was true for me 3 months after I started learning Haskell. Now I have > 8 years of Python experience and less than 2 years experience with Haskell and the type system demonstrably speeds me up. Way, way faster to use Haskell&#x27;s type system first than to use Python&#x27;s type system and trace backs to debug type errors later. (I still like and use Python a lot -- just sayin.)<p>> The guy giving the talk, Robert Smallshire, did his own research where he scanned github, 1.7 million repos, 3.6 million issue to get some data. What he found was that there were very few type error based issues for dynamic languages.<p>> So for example take python. Out of 670,000 issues only 3 percent were type errors (errors a static typed language would have caught)<p>This strikes me as one of the most problematic parts of the post. To me this just seems to be evidence that in Python, at least, TypeError is more common when you are using something interactively, and you can resolve the issue for yourself (because it generally directly means <i>you</i> are using it wrong, and it&#x27;s <i>not</i> the library&#x27;s fault).<p>This also resonates with my experience with Pandas on GitHub. Early on there was a lot of TypeError stuff with index-related issues, but once the bulk of that work became mature, index errors were then a signal of a novice user who needed to change the user code, and not at all an indication of a library problem worthy of opening a GitHub issue.<p>It seems totally reasonable to me to hypothesize that the types of problems worthy of becoming GitHub issues are not usually TypeError. But TypeError might still be a huge proportion of all of the errors encountered out in the wild.<p>Further, there&#x27;s also some selection effects here for users who actually post things to GitHub. When I worked in quant finance, and everything was in Python, it was an hourly occurrence for hugely important parts of the system to hit type errors, and they were all incredibly painful to fix in the legacy code. This was just accepted as a way of life, and because the invest staff weren&#x27;t incentivized to care much about code, they usually just hacked their own work arounds, and would never have dreamt of actually opening a GitHub issue about type errors (that would be way too slow of a dev cycle for them, which is why the state of the code was so poor in the first place!)<p>> His point there is that all that static boilerplate you write to make a statically typed language happy, all of it is only catching 2% of your bugs.<p>This is absolutely false and not a valid generalization of the presented data. For one, a major claim of static typing proponents is that by writing with static typing, it eliminates bugs from ever being introduced, and allows you to use a compiler workflow to verifiably remove entire classes of bugs. When you run some bit of Python and it does not produce a TypeError -- that doesn&#x27;t mean the code is free of errors. It might just mean you got lucky that the data or the user selections or whatever didn&#x27;t happen to hit the TypeError corner case. With a static language, you <i>know</i> that certain classes of errors are not even possible -- not just that they didn&#x27;t happen to occur this one time, but that they <i>cannot</i> occur. This is <i>very</i> different.<p>Further, another claim of static typing proponents is that the <i>design process</i> of code with static also leads to fewer bugs because the mandate for static types forces you to clarify befuddled design ideas before the program will work. The benefit of this is murkier, for sure, but it&#x27;s still something that can&#x27;t be addressed by this particular data.<p>> Some other study compared reliability across languages and found no significant differences. In other words neither static nor dynamic languages did better at reliability.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to me that that chart doesn&#x27;t include any functional languages. Let&#x27;s try it again with a pure functional language and see, and then also compare, say, Clojure with Haskell. If it keeps on robustly bearing out the same trend, then I might start to question my current beliefs on defect rates in dynamic, imperative languages.<p>> Part of that was reflected in size of code. Dynamic languages need less code.<p>This again is relative to the ability of a developer and also relative to different types of tasks. However, it&#x27;s not really fair to compare languages like C, where brevity of syntax was not too big of a language design priority, with a language like Python, where brevity of syntax is sometimes militant (just try talking with &quot;Pythonistas&quot; on Stack Overflow about why one-liner-ness is really not that useful). And also, at least part of the result is fixed for you: static typing at the very least requires the extra type annotations -- although here again you could try against something like Haskell where you have very powerful type inference. I would be extremely surprised if, for equivalently experienced developers, Haskell programs were not consistently shorter than Python programs.<p>> He points out for example when he’s in python he misses the auto completion and yet he’s still more productive in python than C#<p>Try Jedi in emacs (or whatever the equivalent must be in vim). Although, I for one hate IDEs (get off my lawn) and I also hate autocompletion and editor utilities that jump to function or class definitions. I&#x27;ve never noticed a significant speed up from these, except possibly when I am merely reading code from a large codebase that is brand new to me. But I have often experienced huge slowdowns from the features getting in my way.<p>> Another point he made is that writing static types is often gross and unmaintainable whereas writing unit tests not.<p>See Haskell. Also, writing unit tests can be a nightmare in OO and imperative settings, where you need some inscrutable cascade of mocked architecture to be able to test things. This is where something like Haskell&#x27;s QuickCheck can make life a lot easier. I&#x27;m sure you could cook up something like that in Python too. But I strongly believe that writing unit tests in Python is way uglier and more frustrating than writing type annotations in Haskell.",1453238446

A wrist watch probably sees more uniform temperatures (esp. if it&#x27;s worn all the time and e.g. has a large metallic backing).  Laptops can get quite hot and quite cold.<p>You can get temperature compensated oscillators down to about 1ppm accuracy over a larger temperature range.  1ppm is about 1 second/week.<p>Back in the day I wrote a little utility where every time you adjusted your computer clock it took notice of the drift and fed that back into the time calculation.  I.e. it continuously adjusted the clock based on the corrections given to it.",1453238348

I am not qualified to offer tax advice, so this is all fiction based on my experiences of paying taxes in the Bay Area while working at startups and larger companies ...<p>It used to be that you could buy your options and hold them without any tax hit. After holding them for a year, <i>if you could sell them</i>, any gain was taxed at the long term capital gain rate. Since the long term capital gains rate (LTCGR) was much much lower than the short term gain, this strategy reduced the amount of taxes you paid. It was deemed a &quot;loop hole&quot; that the rich used and it needed fixing.<p>The fix was something called &quot;Alternative Minimum Tax&quot; or AMT. The way AMT works is it ignores the fact that you cannot sell your stock, and asks you to compute if you had sold the stock options you just exercised and treated all of that gain as ordinary income, how much tax would you have owed in that fictional scenario? Then it asks you to compare your tax bill in that fictional universe, and your bill without considering that fiction, and which ever is higher? That is how much you owe in taxes. It doesn&#x27;t matter how you came by the stock, it could be through restricted stock plans (no cost to you to vest) or incentive plans. The difference between how much you paid, versus how much that stock is theoretically &quot;worth&quot; is treated like ordinary income.<p>What that means from a practical standpoint is that you are screwed either way. But if the stock becomes worthless you are doubly screwed. First you lose all the money you paid to exercise (the value is now zero) and second, while you can claim a capital loss, that loss can only be applied against an offsetting gain of &quot;like&quot; kind. So back when it was an AMT calculation you had to treat it like ordinary income, but now as a capital loss you can only offset other capital gains. The small concession is that you can consider up to $3,000 as a loss against your income (so you adjust your income down by $3,000 and you end up not having to pay the marginal rate income tax on that $3,000. If you&#x27;re in California and an engineer making $100K+ annually that means you are probably in the 28% tax bracket paying 28% federal and 11% CA state tax, (39%) so you get to &quot;keep&quot; 39% of $3,000 or $1,170 that you would have paid in taxes.<p>So are you keeping score? You paid $3,000 in tax on an asset you could never sell, and you got to offset your income by $3,000 so you got &quot;back&quot; $1,170 of it, letting $1,830 of it evaporate into smoke.<p>You can get it back, dollar for dollar, if you have some capital asset that you&#x27;re selling and seeing a gain on, then you can apply every dollar of your loss against that gain, up to all of your loss, and not pay any tax on that gain. (that doesn&#x27;t work for offsetting AMT but does work for an actual capital gain, like sale of property or equity you were already holding).<p>The system is designed to take money you might have otherwise been entitled to out of your pocket and to put it into the general fund of the government so they can spend it poorly on their own programs (ok that is a bit cynical but seriously, I would be totally ok if they told me I had to give some to charity.)<p>If you don&#x27;t have capital gains you want to offset, don&#x27;t exercise your options until you can actually sell them. If they are going to expire before you can sell them, the safe play is to let them expire.",1453238028

Same with counting &quot;type errors&quot; of dynamic languages, it seems the definition of &quot;type errors&quot; would entirely depend on how exhaustive the hypothetical static type system would be.  Also, it&#x27;s kind of weird (and I&#x27;ve seen this before from other dynamic type enthusiasts) to imply that unit tests are only for dynamically typed code - we use them in statically-typed languages too!<p>I generally hold the point of view that dynamically typed languages are great for prototyping and when you are in the &quot;build fast and break stuff&quot; phase, and that statically typed languages are better for when correctness and maintenance matter more.

Structural types also remove dependencies because the function defines the <i>structure</i> of the type it expects, and not a specific reference.<p>Also, I think github repos (and the person&#x27;s tests) are heavily heavily bias towards individual projects.

Reading it is, making changes to code someone else wrote is, and refactoring across dozens of modules is a problem. Static languages help a lot with all three. I still love dynamic languages for small tasks, but I&#x27;d rather use a static language like Go which still keeps much of the dynamic feel, and helps catch my mistakes at compile time. I actually just set it to watch the project directory for changes and recompile automatically in a terminal on another screen (actually to run the unit tests, which includes compiling.) That&#x27;s constant feedback and comparable to dynamic languages speed for edit-compile-test runs. But the best part is the unit tests.

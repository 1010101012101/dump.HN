1875546,comment,1872927,1873580,0,0,soiz,,,"Funny I forgot about this, but now that I think of it, I did martial arts classes for years and it never felt like work.<p>I played basketball for years and even the drills never felt like work.<p>I guess it's the difference between work and play.<p>I don't know what the psychological underpinnings are for the subjective qualitative difference, but I think this may relate to the ""effortlessness"" of Taoism vs. the ""effort"" of Buddhism.  Just hypothesizing.<p>I can read for hours and research subjects of interest and it's never ""work"".<p>I can practice something on the piano that I like, which is difficult to play, and it's not ""work""; but doing contrived exercises with the same finger-movements feels like work.<p>I not only find it totally believable that playing guitar was subjectively NOT work to Jimi Hendrix, but I would go further and say he NEVER would have gotten to where he got if it DID seem like work.<p>If you only love the glory, and not the process, how will you even persist long enough to get there?<p>A few further examples -- Kobe Bryant LOVES basketball.  There are a lot of talents who go into the NBA for the paycheck and then underachieve; it's just a job to them.  Kobe isn't the best athlete in the NBA -- many can jump higher or run faster.  But he is the most skilled, and the best seemingly-impossible shot maker in the history of the game.  <i>Kobe, 13, joins the Sonny Hill summer league in Philadelphia, where a counselor scolds him for listing the NBA as his future career. ""The guy said NBA players are one in a million,"" Kobe says. ""I said, 'Man, look, I'm going to be that one in a million.' ""</i><p>Lance Armstrong LOVES riding his bike.  It was his route to personal freedom in football-loving Texas, and he would go for a ride any time he needed to think.<p>Adam Lambert LOVES performing.  He was always performing and singing since he was a child.  He would drive his little brother crazy by always singing and dancing to things on the radio and making up his own versions of songs.<p>And these are just people with a high level of COMMERCIAL success.  All of them would have had their own success of some sort, by doing what they loved, even if they didn't become millionaires.<p>So it kind of depends on what you mean by ""amount to anything"".  By whose standards?<p>I remember some story, which was a true story, possibly from Outliers, I don't quite remember; it was about parents making their kids do something that the parents wanted.  Something like: A surgeon had wanted to be a dancer but he was forced to be a doctor; he received some prestigious award that all his fellow surgeons coveted, but he was miserable.  ""But you've been recognized by all your peers as being the best surgeon!""  ""Yes,"" he responded dejectedly, ""but I'm the worst dancer!""<p>A further example was of two parents who had been forced into respectable professions; the mother had wanted to be a pianist instead.  So she decided that wouldn't happen to HER daughter; she hired private music tutors.  Except the daughter had no interest in piano...  she was being forced into it!<p>Even if you get what you want, you have to have the capacity to <i>enjoy</i> it, or it won't mean anything to you.  Depending on the state of your hormones and neurotransmitters, this can vary drastically even over the course of a single day.<p>The biggest dichotomy I see now is between Creators and Consumers.  Most of our socialization has the effect of turning us into the latter.  How many stories have we seen of people making a million dollars off something that ANY of us COULD do, but they actually went and DID it?<p>Unlike the school and work system, which reward conformity, there is a huge amount of real-world success from being DIFFERENT.  If you get really good at ANYTHING, you can probably make a living from it.  Even just being weird.<p>Society serves a very useful purpose, though, because the more it turns everyone into consumers, the less you have to CREATE in order to make a living.  Just look at Mob Wars or Reddit.<p>So whichever angle you approach it from, personal satisfaction or commercial success, it seems the way to go is to do whatever is subjectively RIGHT for <i>you</i>.",1289004995

1875537,comment,1874772,1875480,0,0,windle,,,"Many people loved ""from pylons import config"", until it didn't work, which frequently happened anytime someone wanted to use something from a Pylons app in a command line script (which seems to be pretty often). I do have a few minor clean-ups that help slightly with that stuff which I'll likely put out a Pylons 1.0.1 to address.<p>> Let me make this clear: do I believe Pylons could be better? Yes I do. Do I think killing it to make it better was a good idea? No, I don't.<p>So, the whole 'killing' thing seems slightly extreme. I've maintained Pylons with few changes besides bug fixes, security fixes, and deprecating old things for the past <i>several years</i>. And now the announcement that I don't plan on doing any more than <i>the same thing</i> for the pylons package code-base is ""killing it off""?<p>If you're happy with pylons, there's no need to stop using it. The docs will always be available for it, the code-base will not be removed. By design, I just couldn't see how to continue it forward in ways that I (and a lot of people I've talked with) need.<p>Of course, a lot of people may not need anything more than pylons provides right now, and in that case I'd be hard pressed to tell them to switch their code to use pyramid. pylons is stable, mature, and has been maintained as such for quite awhile, there's a book that still pretty much applies to 1.0.<p>> Anyway, I have tremendous respect for Ben and can't blame him for getting bored and wanting to work on something different.<p>Thanks, sorry my nick doesn't reflect it, this is Ben. Seems I can't change my profile info on ycombinator, sigh. Or that 'feature' doesn't exist, anyways...<p>As I mentioned, the Pylons code-base was essentially frozen for any direction forward which I needed to build higher level tools. I know this may not be immediately obvious to everyone depending on your requirements, and pylons suits many peoples needs perfectly well.<p>I will be blogging about this in the future, at which point some of the key differences, and what they enable will hopefully become more clear. But Pylons is definitely not dead, and I think it won't be too long before people start to see what a larger development team can do. :)",1289004667

I find myself stupid to wait 10 seconds just to load up GMail to quickly look up something. Why I am wasting these 10 seconds loading up a webapp when 99.9% of the time I am using my own computer?<p>You say running a desktop email client with GMail IMAP? The fact is I got tired of GMail's way of doing IMAP. I cannot remember how many times I try to make the `delete` key to actually trash an email in Mail.app. It's an even bigger mistake with its Push Email on iPhone. So half-baked IMAP and half-baked Exchange.<p>Finally, I could not stand it any more and moved over to MobileMe and cannot be happier. I still use the same GMail address and simply have GMail forward everything to my MobileMe account. This way, I get to keep my email address and take advantage of GMail's nice spam filter. I know GMail has IMAP and can do Push email and this and that, and after you configure this and that, it will work; but I am not a fancy person and just want to read, delete and send email, from my three Macs, an very old iPhone and an iPad. My days of messing around with kernel modules are over, and I guess I am old enough to start enjoying the almost-zero-configuration of MobileMe on all my computing devices.",1289004572

As a matter of fact, I agreed on the following: 1) Zed has every right to complain due to his copyright and the license which his work carries 2) What Martin did was wrong, and as such he should accept that fact that the owner disapproves and take the work down (which he did) 3) Martin violated Zed's copyright. I explicitly said that what he did was copyright infringement, which can certainly be attributed to a mistake, because you wrongly stated it was plagiarism, which is considered morally unacceptable and reprehensible, and is in no way the same thing.<p>You want to know what IS irrelevant? The fact that Martin and Zed (and both you and me actually) both acknowledged that the approach is not useful, specially since I already stated in the grandparent post - to which you responded - that I agreed on not only Zed's rights as copyright holder, but also on the fact that the approach is rubbish. It doesn't matter whatsoever if the approach works or not, it only matters that Martin did it in good faith because he believed it could be of use when he started, even if later he discovered to be wrong on this count.<p>I addressed your fart noises on my second point of the parent post, on the last paragraph I was referring to actual farting because it is more representative of what happened here. I referred to them separately and referred to 'farting' and 'farting noises' to make this clear (as they are obviously two different things). The fact that you equate a jerk making farting noises in a restaurant with making a mistake in regards to a free book's licensing is beyond my comprehension, as it implies that you're disagreeing with the intent of the person in question when it was already not only stated by him, but by Zed himself in his messages.<p><i>Also, it's ""make fart noises"", not ""fart"". As in deliberately make a noise considered rude.</i><p>You said it yourself, the key word on this example is 'deliberately'. Martin did not make deliberately farting noises (deliberately and knowingly doing copyright infringement on Zed's work), he actually farted by mistake (mistakenly having violated Zed's copyright thinking it was fair use), and because of this he should apologize to the restaurant, but such events in no way grant Zed the right to humiliate, demean, or degrade Martin. I'm not justifying Martin's actions, as I agree that he's wrong and Zed is right, I'm criticizing Zed's responses and the manner in which he expressed himself towards not only towards Martin, but towards the Ruby community itself.<p>The funny thing is that I actually respect Zed for his contributions, and isn't someone I'll be deleting from my newsreader because of something as non-important as this.

You really need to understand each atomic piece before you move on.<p>In most explanations of monads the teacher rattles off a long run-on sentence that touches on several facets of a concept such as monads, making it all that much harder to digest. In fact, most sentences/paragraphs attempting to explaining monads just cause the learner to choke on the terseness and density of information being communicated in one utterance.<p>The way I see it, both types of books are very valuable. The Little Schemer teaches recursion as a concept better than any other text I've seen. I've never seen anything else that come close. In fact, most texts that touch on recursion quickly move into comparing it to iteration both in form and performance. SICP is an example of a teaching resource that does this.

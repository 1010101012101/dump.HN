3470338,comment,3469453,3469453,5,0,tansey,,,"I'm jumping in a little late to this discussion, but I'm sort of required to comment here.<p>First off, as of early last year, I noted [1] that there is in fact quantitative evidence that HN is deteriorating in terms of positivity. I really need to re-run that analysis and bring it up to date, because I believe that we will see a sharp dip in the last 9 months. Between SOPA, Jobs' death, and all the other calamity that's happened, I certainly imagine it is getting darker here lately.<p>Secondly, I've put forward a few attempts to combat this. One approach is to change the way the karma system works [2], so that it rewards people for consistently being upvoted instead of the sort of lightning-bolt comments that tend to yield an exponential or maybe even bimodal distribution.<p>Another approach is to detect and flag anyone who is frequently rewarding malicious comments [3]. The system I put forth could be done either by manual flagging or implicitly by looking at co-occurrences. It was originally designed for articles, but as I noted in the post, it is trivial to adapt it to comments.<p>Now, in all these cases, the articles were on the front page and a lively discussion ensued. Yet nothing. Ever. Changes.<p>PG explicitly said he was ""considering"" the honeypot approach. I don't know if he's actually implemented it, since it wouldn't be visible to non-admins. I will guess that, since he's a busy guy and we still have these discussions periodically, he has not. Fine.<p>Why would you expect things to change course then? Or if you didn't, why are you all acting surprised now?<p>A site growing at super-linear speed is going to be very prone to these affects. If you do not put forth an effort to combat the influx of lower-quality comments, then you will see your site slip away.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.effectcheck.com/2011/05/31/do-social-news-sites-deteriorate/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.effectcheck.com/2011/05/31/do-social-news-sites-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nashcoding.com/2011/08/23/how-karma-should-be-measured/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nashcoding.com/2011/08/23/how-karma-should-be-mea...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.nashcoding.com/2011/10/28/hackernews-needs-honeypots/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nashcoding.com/2011/10/28/hackernews-needs-honeyp...</a>",1326715072
3470337,comment,3469453,3469453,1,0,zerostar07,,,"- Herding people seems to be a very difficult problem, but on the other hand i am not aware of scientific approaches to it. There's only assumptions that things like karma, upvotes, reputation increase the likelihood of a comment being useful. Can anyone point to relevant literature?<p>- In the end, i don't think it's possible to stop people from commenting, people just feel the need add a comment when they have read an interesting post (Just like this very comment in fact). Having a rule that says not to means nothing. Having your comment under an interesting topic is a modern way to say <i>""Hey that caught my interest and i think i should participate in the group that discusses this topic, even though i don't have anything insightful to say""</i>. It's mostly an emotional reaction.<p>- As this is a threaded discussion, many people will post just to start a conversation (because they want to spark that conversation), or even start an argument.<p>- IMHO, the quality of the comments is directly related to the quality of the frontpage links. HN frontpage is heavily moderated that's why it's (for me at least) the best internet frontpage for technically-minded people. Not having a financial incentive is a big plus as administrators dont have to worry about readership.<p>- As a consequence of the frontpage quality, people who want to waste time don't stay long enough to add comments. Otherwise, i don't think there's anything special about the comment section here.",1326715045

3470328,comment,3469927,3469927,12,0,Alexx,,,"Minimalism and 'getting rid of your possessions' has been one of those hot internet topics for as long as I can remember.<p>The trend I notice is that the articles preaching the extreme end of this are almost always written by 20-something bloggers who are so much happier now they're couch surfing the world care free rather than 'working 9-5 to pay for that TV'.<p>Obviously, there is a large truth in there. We all take only a few things on holiday with us and enjoy it. But sleeping on other peoples couches, using their kitchens, bathrooms and towels, and freelancing to get some money to your paypal account now and then isn't a particularly sustainable lifestyle.<p>I suspect if you came back in 10 years you'll see a different picture. If you want to  think about having children or living a generally western lifestyle as opposed to a '3rd world' or really homeless lifestyle then there's a sensible balance point.<p>I believe rejecting materialism is about giving your energy, focus and love to your passions, your family, and enjoying the experiences life gives you over material things. Not blindly aiming to own 10 or 20 objects while you're basically renting or borrowing everything else to keep living in a western style. All things in moderation :)",1326714974

3470318,comment,3469845,3469845,3,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I think the author is singling out IP-Law when his problem is with our legal system in general.  For better or worse our modern legal system is built around overly strict limits that are, by design, rarely enforced.<p>To give an example consider the freeway.  Where I live most cars drive 70 to 75 mph without causing a safety risk and I know it's CHP policy to ignore anyone driving less than 10 miles over the limit.  But they could pull over all those people because the official speed limit is 65 mph.  So they've established a speed limit that's stricter than it needs to be and have encouraged the breaking of that limit.  This allows them to pull over virtually anyone they want for any cause they feel like.<p>This is true throughout our legal system.  There's actually a recently published book called ""3 Felonies a Day: How The Feds Target the Innocent"" that makes this case quite well.  The premise being every American inadvertently commits 3 felonies a day just by living a normal life.<p>So while the blog post is right to point out the illogical nature of IP-Law he should understand it was written that way by design to allow for easier prosecution.<p>(prosecution might not be the right word since IP issues are civil but you get the point)",1326714547

3470298,comment,3467585,3470206,4,0,o2sd,,,"> If you're passionate about computing and software engineering, you'll have a natural interest in how things work under the hood.<p>When I was 12, I learned 6502 assembly language. The computer I had did not have a C compiler, only BASIC or assembler (you could also enter hex into memory locations, which was hardcore). Learning assembly is actually a LOT easier than people make out. Assembly is basically mnemonics for the underlying machine code, plus named locations. Assembly has everything a language needs for Turing completeness. Assign, Add, Subtract, Compare, Branch. And THAT is how the computer works 'under the hood'. C is one level of abstraction above that, and while it's true that a LOT of software has been historically written in C, before C came along, most software was written in assembler or BASIC (which is older than C, for the historians).<p>> Learning C is almost mandatory if you want to see how deep the rabbit hole is.<p>Not really. I know what is going on 'down there', regardless of which language was used to compile the machine code. What is REALLY useful is to have really succinct, powerful, high-level abstractions to build software quickly and with as little code as possible.<p>> Knowing it will certainly help when exploring the intricacies of processors and operating systems.<p>If that's what you want to do, then fine. I'm too much of a utilitarian for that kind of exploration. I want to build stuff.<p>I think if you want to understand what's going on 'down there' in the 'rabbit hole', learn assembly language. There are only seven to ten basic instructions and you can learn them in a couple of days. You can build anything you want in assembly language, if you have an eternity to do it in.",1326713876

Criticism based on logic and rhetoric (ad hominem, straw-man, etcetera) has lost some ground to internet-acronyms (IANAL, IIRC, and such) Since culling sources takes work, this warrants addressing for risk of losing this relevance.<p>I've been thinking about this problem recently in the face of web searches that yield forum discussions. I'm begun to avoid forum results, due to endless threads that lack a solution to the specific problem (even sometimes incorrectly marked [Solved]).<p>Curated Q&A sites [2] address this successfully by putting the correct answer above the fold. But community discussions don't have a correct answer, so the problem here is not quite the same. I don't have a solution, but even revising sort order might do. I'd hazard to suggest an additional degree of community-based voting and editing should be added.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3469618"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3469618</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.question2answer.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.question2answer.org/</a><p>[edit] formatting",1326713488

This was name calling and an ad hominem attack, not a mutually respectful discussion. Moreover, it is apparent to me that you were trying to argue with me without a clear understanding of my position.<p>I am sure there is more to Obama than just incompetence, and it has been painful to me to watch Americans fall for him so thoroughly in the recent years. But when you use the word ""evil"", you are in danger of losing the sight of the political landscape in the country. And, at the same time, losing the perspective on what the true evil is.<p>Example from my personal biography. I now live in the United States, came here 20 years ago from Russia, so before then I lived in the Soviet Union. USSR during the time of Brezhnev (which is the USSR I remember) was certainly worse in the aspects that were mentioned (liberties, personal rights, and so on; plus a totalitarian ideology, which is non-existent in the US). Even so, it was not an embodiment of evil. Before that, Stalin's times were much worse, and certainly closer to the absolute evil, but even that pales in comparison to Nazi Germany. Which, luckily, was destroyed well before I was born, so no personal memories. Was it evil? Perhaps, but it's a long way from Brezhnev's USSR which is a long way from the modern USA.<p>You, if you are a native born American, could go back to your (or your parents') history, comparing the USA of 2011 with the USA of 1960s, 1950s, WWII, and so on. Those were not evil times, and still the situation has noticeably improved since then.<p>I am not saying we should not be vigilant. I am saying we should not make every political disagreement into a battle field. People with whom we disagree are not necessarily monsters, maybe they simply have a different opinion or calculate odds differently. There is often, more often than not, room for compromises. They are people too.<p>Edit: I apologize for verbosity. Just thought you deserved an honest explanation.",1326711930

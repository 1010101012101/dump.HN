There is an academic-minded ""sect"" that might consider this blasphemous, but Kabul, the current Secretary of Defense, even the year of WWII, none of these issues come to bear on the daily lives of college students.<p>Older generations love to talk about how politically/globally minded they were and how they fought against the Vietnam War, but the fervence of their objection was only proportional to what they stood to loose through the draft.<p>I see a lot of opinion that generation xyz is stuck to their blackberries/iphones/facebook/myspace/etc. and that not only are they ignorant, but that this is some kind of historically unprecented phenomenom. But I just don't buy it -- they're in college (or high school), by and large their parents are supporting them -- maybe when the time comes for them to support themselves some of these issues will become relevant (at least tax raises and cuts), and many of these kids will ""get smart.""<p>There will always be those who are diligent and alert -- as long as being so conveys some kind of quantifiable advantage.

Message passing if you want to get fancy. Erlang, with its touted high-availability capabilities follows this model.<p>Threading is <i>hard</i>. I've written thread-oriented code and process-oriented code. The process-oriented code was far easier to develop and debug. Issues in threaded code are difficult to reproduce and even harder to fix.<p>I've been on both the OS engineering team and the app development team across several corporations. In a large managed Java environment, the OS team is powerless to stop a runaway process. To the OS, all that business logic is enapsulated in one giant opaque container. The <i>kill -9</i> and <i>fuser</i> ommands are barbaric ways to manage your sensitive computing needs. Unix broke away from the monolithic style of development, but the Enterprise Java culture embraces it. On the other hand, the app development team can live in its own little world, not trusting the OS and reinventing wheel after wheel.<p>These days it's apparent that Unix has won the OS wars, at least on the server side. With Unix, you can trust your operating system. Take advantage of it. It has amazing reliability and if you can just work with it instead of against it, you reap many benefits.<p>Now we just need to convince the app developers that the philosophy of ""many small tools working together"" is superior to the ""one giant tool doing everything"".

If your periodical of choice sits on a story, or misreports, you will likely never find out about it if you don't pay attention to outside sources (e.g. the NYT sat on their report about the administration's illegal domestic spying/warrantless wiretapping program until after the 2004 election).",1207852247

160169,comment,159815,159815,0,0,geebee,,,"I don't think it's the money.  It's the absence of the need to deal with paying.<p>For instance, I recently wanted to check out a memory-resident database.  Suppose that there was one that costs $50, and one that is free and open source.  Like most devs, I don't have a company credit card, so I'd have to go off and ask financial for $50.  They'd give it to me (with no grumbling), but I have to send an email, find them, fill out the form, get a req #, and so forth.  Even if I do have the right to spend money without asking first, I'm still probably going to try the free one.  As a result, I build my mental model around the free one, and then whatever I look at next seems different.  The pay one has to be considerably better to overcome this disadvantage.<p>Everyone else does this too, so when I type ""memory resident database"" into Google, the free ones tend to pop up first.  And when I start wondering how memory resident databases handle resultsets differently from disk I/O, the programmer who wondered about this earlier and wrote an article about it has almost always used the free, open source one (because the code is right there for review, and can be analysed), and uses it to illustrate.  Eventually, the amount of documentation for the free/open source one greatly exceeds the one that costs money.<p>In the end, it's hard for commercial software to compete with open source/free <i>in commodity products</i>.  Keep in mind, I'm not equating commodity with simplicity.  Linux, mySQL, Rails, Python - these are all way more complicated than most products that sell for money.<p>In other words, the code that handles supply chain calculations is a lot more likely to sell for money than the database, operating system, and web server used to host it.",1207851983

3860426,comment,3859506,3860049,8,0,anigbrowl,,,"<i>None of this stuff would happen if not for facebook</i><p>You could have said that about AOL or CompuServe or any other of several previous market leaders. for that matter, people managed to have social lives prior to the advent of the internet; the media of communication were things like posters, bulletin boards (as in large pieces of wood), small ads, magazines and so on. I don't think the article is picking on FB particularly, it's just the company that happens to be on top of the social networking pile right now. What the author is getting at is that things have sort of plateaued for the time being and it's not obvious where the fundamental innovation is coming from, so in the meantime you're seeing a lot of cargo cultism.<p>Think of what we have now as a large-scale version of the pre-web internet, which was much more limited in scope than that of today, but internally quite well connected as long as you were content to adopt a unix-y way of looking at things. The advent of the browser upended all that, but at the very beginning it was quite clunky and a lot of people thought it might be a problem in search of a solution. To my mind, the proliferation of APIs and attempts to establish platforms is quite similar to past stages of development. Facebook is not the problem; it's the curremt least bad solution to the problem (for many people). I'll cannibalize a recent comment on another thread [1] to sum up why:<p><i>Avid Facebook users want their content within Facebook's standardized UI and relatively well-curated system. Like AOL, Facebook is the online equivalent of the mall - somewhat bland, but fairly clean, safe, and above all well-organized. Myspace was just as technically impressive as Facebook back in the day, but because it included a host of customization options it wound up looking like a shopping district that had gone to seed and was covered in bad graffiti and flyposters. You could tell it was doomed when some people were making a business out of selling sparkly animated gifs as page backgrounds. Myspace was so freely customizable that browsing and navigation ended up becoming a chore for visitors; you'd go to someone's page, loud music would start, and you'd be frantically looking for the transport/volume controls - like multimedia Geocities. With Facebook you never get lost as a visitor, and if the site limits a page owner's visual expression somewhat, the same is true for everyone else so you're not at a real disadvantage.</i><p>1. <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3850935"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3850935</a><p>So what is the problem, exactly? Platform fragmentation. I spend most of my social internet time on Hacker News and Metafilter, and on a few other forums to a lesser degree. It's probably not an accident that these are among the least visually crufty and feature-rich social sites on the web; HN doesn't even allow inline hyperlinks. I personally share things mostly by cutting and pasting URLs. I maintain very little presence on Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or (insert your favorite thing here) because of the transactional overhead. All social sites involve Conversations with persistent Communities of People about Stuff, and I've capitalized those 4 elements because they're like the legs of a table and can be captured within relatively simple data structures.<p>Platform fragmentation is the fact of all these different services having distinct identities. From an individual human point of view what matters is this conversation, the social groups we are in, you and I as persons, and this substantive topic. We could be having this conversation on Facebook, G+, Twitter (in very fragmented form) or wherever. What makes HN unique is the stuff people want to talk about and the group of people with overlapping interests. The actual mechanisms of displaying and posting are incidental. to my mind they <i>should</i> be wholly transparent, in the same way that I don't care about exactly which routers this message goes through to reach you, or where those switches and servers are located, or who manufactured them or wrote the firmware. We've abstracted away the hardware layer, and in my perfect world we'd now abstract away the UI layer as well. On the other hand, you could make the argument that NNTP and Usenet have ultimately failed to fulfill their potential because of a tragedy-of-the-commons problem; it's so public that it's hard to curate, and it's not obvious how to make money out of it.<p>PS: also a problem for RSS. The browser is, at its core, a page rendering interface, just as a terminal is a highly interactive text interface. That's great, because we are very clever at putting things on pages. But what we need now is a network traversal interface.",1334786041

3860420,comment,3860183,3860183,3,0,lukifer,,,"Politically incorrect rant here; brace yourself.<p>Put simply, I have a hard time taking TG issues as seriously as I take gay rights, which I support unilaterally. There is a long history of homosexual behavior both in humans and in nature. But the idea of altering sexuality with surgery is extremely recent, and I am unaware of any precedent in nature (feel free to correct me).<p>Now, bear in mind that I support anybody's choice to do just about anything to themselves. If you want to give yourself a face tattoo, attach a shark fin to your back, or give yourself fake breasts, knock yourself out. And I don't think such individuals should be judged or persecuted, to the extent that's possible.<p>At the same time, the TG community needs to understand that people <i>will</i> judge you, not because they're prejudiced, but because judging is something that humans do in general. If someone laughs at you behind your back for a bad haircut or an outfit that clashes, it may be impolite and mean, but it's not out of hate. If you look ridiculous, whether it's for 50 piercings, or heavy makeup combined with an Adam's Apple, people are going to see you differently, period. And maybe I've received a bad sampling, but I can't ever recall encountering a TG person who did not look ridiculous to me. If that's my flaw, then I'll accept that. I still treated those persons with the same dignity I would give someone with a bad haircut.<p>I am sensitive to those who feel they were born with the wrong body, and absolutely believe that some people inherited a genuine genetic flaw with which they must cope. Even if the gender conflict is psychological, it is a person's right to deal with that how they choose. I understand what it's like to feel like a freak. (I'm still waiting on the possibility of species reassignment surgery...)<p>But be realistic. If you're going to switch to another gender, and you can't make it work so well that no one can tell the difference (ie, Carmen from It's Always Sunny), people are going to look at you weird.

They have been swimming in space radiation for millions of years, so even metals that are usually non-radioactive, like iron should get plenty of opportunity to get activated.

I assumed they didn't intend to filter the air because an air filter may become clogged by sand particulate - especially in a sand storm. I said reverse osmosis for the filter, merely because this setup is actually well suited for it, and if these turn out to be mass produced (hopefully cheaper for more litres of water a day) that they may become used in more urban areas where pollution is a bigger factor. It would also make bacterial contamination less of a concern as mild chlorination of the holding tanks would likely make a long term potable water source with low maintenance.<p>However, the advantage of compressing over refrigerating is that the compressed air could be vented to periodically clean any air filters. It's important that these turbines be very low maintenance if they're to be installed in remote areas. A self-cleaning air filter <i>and</i> a simple water filter might be ideal.",1334783853

All of it is very non-trivial and you can't just focus on one little scenario and hope to get away with it.<p>I suspect you'll see more people going the Phpfog->AppFog route, give up the general PaaS platform to CloudFoundry/Amazon/Heroku and try and move up the stack to provide value on top.

And accompanied by lots of numbers and information. The problem is, it is in itself irrelevant.<p>Why should anyone else care? Maybe professional gardners are having a hard time nowadays and not making much money. Do you care about that? Perhaps they are going to lobby for a law that will increase their income -- i.e. take money from you, and otherwise inconvenience you -- how does that sound?<p>The point is this: we do not care about musician's, or anyone else's, self-interest; we, in general, care about how much <i>we</i> get from them. That is ultimately the only basis of justification for any law here. The public, though laws, grants 'creators' special provisions, in order that the public as a whole benefits.<p>If you want to argue for such special provisions, you must show the benefits that the public generally will get. If you say creators are not making enough money, show that there is, from the public's view, too little stuff being produced.<p>So <i>is</i> there too little music (etc.) being produced? The article did not seem to answer that question -- yet that is the only thing that counts. And from a casual view, as anyone can see just looking around them, there seems to be a heck of a lot of music out there at the moment.<p>Show that insufficient stuff is being produced, and show that any proposed corrective laws or provisions are overall to the public's gain.

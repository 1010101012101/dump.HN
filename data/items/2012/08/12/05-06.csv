Please read Gary Taubes ""Good Calories, Bad Calories"" or ""Why we get fat"". He is one of the leading thinkers in nutrition and is worshipped by other gurus like Tim Noakes (who wrote the runners bible Lore of Running). Taubes spends the first third of ""Why we get fat"" rebuking this ""first law of thermodynamics"" approach to dieting.<p>I'd also argue that nutrition today is evolving from an anecdotal approach to what works e.g. Dr Atkins discovering that if he eats meat-only he gets thin, to a science based approach where we are beginning to understand the profound effect insulin has on fat storage and why dietary fat does not make you fat.<p>Reddit is a great resource for new data, but not a source. It does however have some amazing pointers. Another case in point is the cult of Mark Rippetoe fans on Reddit and the AMA that Rip did on Reddit a while ago which was awesome. [Rippetoe is pretty much God in strength training circles and his book ""Starting Strength"" is the strength training bible.]",1344751004

But then, I'm a physicist and I believe in the laws of thermodynamics.<p>I am in complete agreement with you that starvation diets, fad diets, and other cook-book regimens are likely to result in failure.  The point I was trying to convey was that this failure comes from the fact that it takes willpower to follow these, while you're much more likely to succeed if you try to form habits that don't require willpower to follow.  I was borderline obese once myself, but I never followed any specific diets or regimens.  I just learned healthy habits.<p>Exercise is absolutely crucial for good health.  Just being skinny doesn't necessarily make you healthy.  Perhaps there was less focus on exercise in the past because people were, on average, much more active in their daily jobs.

Fail to compete with competitors\n 3. Fail to build a community<p>Issue 1 manifested itself differently for each site. Xanga couldn't keep up with LiveJournal, which not only arrived on the scene after Xanga but out-innovated them as well. MySpace was a clusterfuck of design and functionality that got stale while Facebook was improving constantly. Digg ignored the hell out of its users and simply had nothing compelling vs Reddit.<p>Also, none of the sites pulled in people and kept them. The narrative for MySpace users was that people were becoming ""friends"" with hundreds of people who they did not know. It doesn't take a genius to realize that this essentially invalidates the whole point of a social network. Xanga never got a large audience and also suffered from the same problem of anonymous users. Digg? Digg never even really tried. Shouts were pathetic.<p>Facebook solved these problems. While MySpace appeared to do nothing after News Corp acquired them, Facebok kept changing the site in a very public way--and even when they got negative publicity (e.g. privacy settings), they made sure that people knew they were actively developing the site. Additionally, users on Facebook know the people in their network, and users are constantly given a reason to come back (communicate with your friends! apps! interact with companies!). Faceboook survived because they made it clear that they are the best game in town.",1344749971

We were using Tapestry and Cayenne (an ORM) and this whole, molasses-slow catastophe in the making, was my first introduction to the life of a professional coder. I still have strong paranoia and anxiety about any magical behaviour. But then the project went from v3 to v4 and <i>everything</i> broke. Zero backwards compatibility. Well - a bit dramatic. Nothing could be _trusted_ to work properly.<p>Tapestry is a reimagined WebObjects framework, and the company I worked for originally specialised in these systems, so it was natural for them to pick Tapestry. I also did a lot of translating/transplanting code from a WebObjects system to a Tapestry 4 system and everything the parent says was true for me. Work on a single component is spread across a minimum of three files, sometimes four, and there is a <i>lot</i> of magic which makes debugging (something you'll have to do a lot) a nightmare. I suspect Tap5 is incompatible and a wholly different beast to Tap4, but to this day I never want to work on a Java based web framework.

There're also a lot of helpful resource threads on such forums, informing newbies on diet, exercises, supplements, etc.<p>On the scientific side of things, I've spent the last few weeks reading a range of PubMed(Central) articles and various blogs and forums on fitness and diet. There are many schools of thought, but many are mostly supported by anecdotal evidence and not studies.<p>What I've found most helpful are scientific studies/articles, e.g.<p>- Evidence-based resistance training recommendations\n<a href=""http://baye.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ebrtr-Fisher1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://baye.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ebrtr-Fisher1.pdf</a><p>- ISSN recommendations for supplementation\n<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2853497/?tool=pubmed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2853497/?tool=pu...</a><p>- Protein per day for muscle-building: 1.6 g/kg of bodyweight (not the 1+g/lb that many sites tout)\n<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2129150/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2129150/</a><p>- Reduce saturated fat intake and replace with polyunsaturated fats, not carbs or monounsaturated fats\n<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19211817"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19211817</a><p>Scientific bloggers are also good to read, if they assess studies critically - people like Bill Shrapnel, DH Kiefer, Bryan Chung, Stephan Guyenet, Alan Aragon. Check their blogs out if you aren't already following them.<p>My current understanding of various controversial topics, based (mostly) on studies:<p><i>Calories in, calories out</i> - absolute calories matters, but is mediated by the effect of composition of diet. Consuming more protein tends to result in an increased lean-mass-to-fat ratio (whether due to satiety, hormonal effects, or a combination of the two).<p><i>Carbs/sugars/starches</i> - high glycaemic-index carbs are riskier than saturated fats for heart disease. They are also associated with weight gain. The endless intake of rice in Asian countries (like mine) makes many of us fat and at risk of heart disease.<p><i>Dietary cholesterol</i> - probably not as bad as previously assumed, but having >6 eggs a <i>week</i> actually increases your risk of heart disease/events.<p><i>Intermittent fasting</i> - I haven't seen the scientific evidence for this, though a friend assures me it's out there. All I see is Berkhan's leangains.com and I'm not sure I'm convinced. I searched PubMed for a bit but didn't come across anything.<p><i>Diet vs exercise for weight loss</i> - diet is the key to weight loss. Neither cardio (whether HIIT or low-intensity) nor resistance training <i>alone</i> is particularly effective at causing weight loss (claims of raised metabolism notwithstanding); you need a calorie deficit as well.<p><i>Training to muscular failure</i> - training to failure actually provides more efficient strength gains.<p><i>Genetics and muscle</i> - genes play a major, possibly the largest, role in determining how much muscle mass individuals can gain and how easily they do it. ""...it appears that those who are naturally lean and muscular to start with, can gain strength and size to a much greater degree than naturally skinny individuals."" i.e. ectomorphs won't be exploding with muscle in short order, despite their best efforts.",1344748857

4371933,comment,4371057,4371608,4,0,vacri,,,"Western medicine has historically never been focused on preventative medicine; their role has traditionally been to <i>make</i> you healthy, not <i>keep</i> you healthy. It's not the conspiracy some might suggest, it's just that historically you called a doctor when you were ill, not for lifestyle advice. When it comes to fitness, you still don't - unless you're talking to a sports doctor, you're not going to get a useful training programme tailored for your needs.<p>Regarding GPs in particular - they aren't really about keeping you trim and terrific. They're about dealing with niggling issues while flagging serious ones for referral to specialists. They do know about basic fitness and diet, but they're not specialists in the area - see sports doctors and dieticians.<p>Also consider that diet is a rapidly moving target at the moment - there's a lot of contradictory opinion and new info coming out all the time. It's not a GP's role to stay at the bleeding edge of medicine. That's what specialists do, and as the specialists settle on the right thing, it filters down to the non-specialists. You can of course find GPs who take special interests in certain areas, and may get lucky and find one that loves fitness and diet.<p>Also, 'palliative' doesn't mean 'after injury', it means 'relieve symtoms without attempting a cure', and most doctors would rather cure a problem than use the patient as a cash cow (there's enough work out there, even before you get to the ethical issues). Perhaps a better pair of terms would be preventative/proactive vs reactive care.",1344748660

Motivation implies some sort of personal failing or personal weakness, which leads me to believe that you buy into the""eat less, exercise more"" mantra.<p>I would just like to point out a few things.<p>You state that ""most people know what they need to do in order to lose weight"" as if there is some cut and dry method to getting thin. Well, I suppose starvation diets ARE that easy, but nobody sticks to them, so they are useless in the long term. This brings me to my first point. If losing weight were as simple as following a specific regimen and the pounds fell off there would be no obesity problem. Nobody chooses to be fat. In fact fat people generally hate it and try incessantly to lose weight. I think the advice that these people get from their doctors, the government, the fitness gurus etc. is almost universally wrong. I could write much more on this subject, but consider that most people that want to lose weight try a variety of methods, and conspicuously none of them work. If this were isolated to just a few people I would say it is a personal defect, but since it is such a widespread phenomena (and growing) I must say I don't think it can simply be explained away as bad habits. People need good information on what to do, and by and large they aren't getting good info.<p>The other thing that I would like to point out is that the focus on exercise is a relatively recent development, and even though more people are exercising than ever before, there has been absolutely no slow down in obesity rates. Go to any gym and you will see an abundance of fat people trying to get fit. It simply doesn't work. They stay fat.",1344747904

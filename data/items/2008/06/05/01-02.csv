Hearing from the perspective of people who do interviews and hiring, they are right. It is a good filter of who is and is not an actual programmer.<p>It makes me also ask the question, are people who use interpreted languages really programmers? The code I write is conceptually programming, but I don't think in terms of how its compiled, but rather how efficiently its interpreted and ran by the web server.",1212630563

209545,comment,208886,208886,0,0,justindz,,,"I'm not going to repeat my whole comment here, but the thing that still bothers me about OpenID is the incentive/adoption interplay.  I don't think OpenID will take off until big players with large user bases make it the preferred authentication method.  The problem is that the big players have an incentive to be providers but not be consumers.  Therefore, the average internet user has <i>more OpenID providers than sites on which they can actually use OpenID each day (in many cases, this is 1 provider, 0 sites, which still illustrates the point).</i><p>I don't think grass roots is going to solve this and I think the incentive needs to be inverted, somehow, for this to get past the trough of disillusionment, or whatever.",1212628637

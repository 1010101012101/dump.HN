2168905,comment,2163762,2168691,0,0,bodyfour,,,"The ""IPv4 marketplace"" idea has serious issues of its own, though:<p>1. it's ARIN (and, I think, other registrars) policy that you do not `own' your assignments in any legal sense.  So if you sell them you may be committing fraud.  If the deal goes bad it's not clear what the legal recourse would be.  This is just a flipside of the ""take back the /8s"" problem: it gives too much for the lawyers to do.<p>They might even collide: suppose a large company with a /8 (say, Haliburton) decides to open a IPv4 marketplace.  In response, ARIN says ""well its clear you have more IP space than you need, so we're taking back your allocation effective next month""  Now who has the rights to those IPs: the people who paid Haliburton for them, or those that got them in new assignments from ARIN?<p>2. Just having an IPv4 address isn't useful if it isn't routable.  To split up a /8 into tiny salable bits means that all of the backbones need to update their BGP route prefix filters.<p>If this were done under the auspices of ICANN this wouldn't be a big problem at all: if ICANN says that the allocation policy for an address range has changed then all of the big players will follow suit.  (There can be a few remaining routing issues for a new /8 on the periphery but they tend to get sorted out fairly quickly)<p>Would a similar announcement from Halliburton have the same effect?  Doubtful, especially if it is done in opposition to ICANN's wishes.  So probably any IPs ""bought"" in this system won't actually be routable.<p>3. Related: even if there was a healthy, 100% legal marketplace for IPv4 space it could only be practical if they were bought and sold in large chunks exclusively.  If everybody who wanted some space for their company had to buy their own /28, the global BGP routing table would completely explode.<p>The only workable marketplace would be at the ISP level.<p>4. The registries are all united in wanting IPv6 deployed.  Having companies making big profits selling their lucky IPv4 windfalls means that there would be deep-pocketed people with a vested interest in stalling IPv6 even more... after all if IPv6 were widely deployed the value of `their' IPv4 addresses would plummet.<p>Now it is true that if the IPv4 situation becomes dire enough, some of these players might decide to suddenly get into the hosting game and put more of their IP space to use.  For instance, Apple has a /8 and just built a HUGE datacenter.. maybe they want to do their own version of EC2?  The idea is a little odd but maybe not unthinkable",1296619157

The actual components were completely known, as well as the manufacturing process, however the specifics of the manufacturing process (-exactly- which machines) were lost. In fact, what you'll find is that when they finally got around to making FOGBANK (albeit at lower yields) the reason the original FOGBANK manufacturing process had such high yields was because the material they were using were actually more impure than the rerun.<p>FOGBANK is actually one of those materials that relies on impurities for it's qualities, and the original documentation did not note this (probably because they did not know), and it was only with more recent techniques that we were able to establish that.<p>Anyhow, the FOGBANK stuff is no where as simple as 'uh durr, silly engineers forgot how to make something'.",1296618877

If you work at a good company that values your contribution they're going to bump your salary as much as they can reasonably afford, keeping in mind fairness to your colleagues and the current budget.<p>In most cases your opportunity to negotiate is during the hiring process. It's hard to push back about your pay once you're hired. The best case is they give you the money because they're afraid you'll leave, but then they'll likely take the necessary steps to make you less integral to the business in case it happens again.<p>You might be better off asking for the opportunity to go to a conference, a workshop, take grad classes, etc. It's easier for them to justify those add-ons because the company stands to benefit from what you learn. It also makes you more valuable, which will possibly get you more money down the road.",1296618825

By all indications, what Apple really wants (aside from a 30% cut that Sony, Amazon, and Barnes & Noble will gladly give them in hell) is for users to have a single (iTunes) login to purchase any kind of content inside apps.<p>Problem is, a single login is impossible. In any of the ebook cases, users will have to log in twice: Once to authenticate for iTunes, and once to authenticate with the ebook store – otherwise their new purchases remain orphaned on the iPad and their existing library is stranded in the cloud.<p>So, there goes the UX angle. All that's left is the financial angle Apple can't possibly expect the other ebook retailers to cave on. This, then, leads ultimately to the possibility that Apple simply wants them off the App Store. Which decreases the value of the iPad for anyone invested in those ecosystems. Maybe Apple never wanted them as customers, anyway?",1296618546

Personally I don't want to see more abuse from Apple and enforced toll-roads for access to users of Apple made (but owned by people who purchase them) devices.<p>It is becoming clearer and clearer that Apple is not satisfied with making bunch of money the ethical way and will use every means available to make even more money unless someone with an ultimate stick steps in and delivers sound beating.",1296616582

But I think the answer would be ""because we can,"" Apple is creating a monopolistic market place for media (look at the battle of record labels providing DRM to Apple and non-DRM to Amazon to lessen-Apple's grip over their digital content) and applications. I think requiring a big player like Sony or Amazon to comply with new policies, will not go over well. I can't see Sony telling Apple ""forget it,"" since I don't know anyone with a Sony eReader... but I could see Amazon and the Kindle, rightly, starting an issue over this. Apple has done a great job of making user friendly (see: locked down) platforms which work well, but the DRM battle and now this could turn public opinion against them.<p>Apple is just trying to create a new revenue stream early on as iPad sales increase and the tablet market heats up; smart move. It'll take a big ereader player like Amazon to battle them, and if ereader content creates a price hike war due to Apple's insistence on 30% cuts, then negative public sentiment towards pricing or not having access to ebook material that has already been purchased on one platform will hopefully create a retraction in Apple's policy.

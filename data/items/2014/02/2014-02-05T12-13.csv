Whether individual consumers will leave iPad mini for one larger combined mobile devices, perhaps.  But I think we&#x27;ll see a trend of iPad minis get used in businesses and dedicated single-use devices (we&#x27;re seeing it with POS some already - that will likely grow).  Now, it may be that android 7&quot; tablets take some of that market too, but... I&#x27;m not sure it will.  <i>cheap</i> android tables (sub $100) aren&#x27;t all that usable for day to day business stuff (I&#x27;ve tried a few - mighty slow, for starters), compared to the punchiness of an iPad mini.<p>The entire market for tablets may shrink if consumers opt for just one larger device, but iPad mini will likely still be a steady device for a long time to come.

Or you were expecting an advice how to live better, faster, happier life?&quot;<p>Sure.  There&#x27;s plenty of blogs like that, aside from fluffblogs.  Almost no one will agree with any given collection but here&#x27;s one anyway.  Mrmoneymustache for personal finance and any generic paleo blog for food, health, and fitness (robb wolf used to be the center of that world, seems he&#x27;s being out-SEO-ed by competitors now).  How much money will improve your life is debatable nonetheless you&#x27;ve got the zerohedge and thehousingbubbleblog.  I tend not to agree with them, but thousands (millions?) of religious bloggers at least think they&#x27;re improving lives, even if I think they&#x27;re generally doing the opposite.  If you allow podcasts (close enough to blogs, read a blog post out loud) there are uncountable educational lecture podcasts (I have listened to about a dozen history related ones, why are history podcasts so popular?) and the survival podcast (which is almost surely not what you think it is, its sort of a how to prosper being a very small scale homesteader, basically this is how to be a non startup non tech non govt handout entrepreneur)<p>There&#x27;s probably a difficult and complicated challenge for a startup to categorize blogs as either deep or fluff.

That isn&#x27;t what I meant when about being concerned about safety. This sounds to me like a very challenging course, that doesn&#x27;t mean it is unsafe.\nWomen on the downhill in Whistler were complaining that the course was too difficult. Olympic organizes also voiced concerns, but realistically, that&#x27;s just how we do it in Whistler, maybe Sochi is a bit of the same.<p>When I am concerned about safety, I do mean safety of the athletes, but I don&#x27;t mean jumps being too big. I&#x27;m more concerned about poor fencing, inconsistent terrain, etc. A pedestrian pathway fell down just before the Commonwealth Games in India a few years ago. Those are the types of safety concerns I was worried about.<p>As far as &#x27;big jumps&#x27; go, I figure, if you&#x27;re a professional athlete and your sport involves jumps, you need to know what speed you can safely take those jumps at.<p>Contrast that to the tragic Skeleton accident on the first day of the Whistler Olympics. Everybody had said how challenging the track was, but nobody imagined anybody would fly off the track and hit a pole. The challenging track is acceptable, the pole is absolutely not. There was nothing the athlete could have done to protect himself once he came off the course.<p>I don&#x27;t know that the snowboard cross comparisons is that kind of dangerous.",1391603930

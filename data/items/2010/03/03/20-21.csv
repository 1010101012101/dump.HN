1165144,comment,1164137,1165075,0,0,chaostheory,,,"Here's an interesting Apple hardware patent:<p>""It is somewhat surprising that Apple received some of the patents in question, such as the patent on ""Conserving Power By Reducing Voltage Supplied To An Instruction-Processing Portion Of A Processor"".  When you peel away the technical language, the patent basically is talking about saving power by supplying less voltage to a circuit and some common strategies to do so.  Not only has then been seemingly done before (prior art), but it also is inherently given by laws of nature (power = current * voltage).  If that's patentable, the general concept of die shrinks should be patentable, overclocking would be patentable (watch out Anandtech.com!), and a whole host of other processes made possible by laws of nature.""<p><a href=""http://www.dailytech.com/Apples+Wild+iPhone+Patent+Attack+Took+HTC+by+Suprise/article17822.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailytech.com/Apples+Wild+iPhone+Patent+Attack+To...</a>",1267649926

On one end you have articles like ""World War 2"", on the other you have articles like ""Sir Chompsalot, the fourth cat of the Doe's in Manchester, Aberdeen Ave."" If we can agree that the latter shouldn't be in Wikipedia, then we have to build some sort of guideline for sufficient notability.

If one person eats one chicken per week that is 52 chicken killings a year, I see nothing evil about that.  If 300 million people eat 1 chicken per week that is <i>15.6 billion</i> living creatures killed per year, but it still isn't evil.  I don't think you are really talking degree, just scale.  In this case doesn't matter, if killing things for food is OK (which I think it is) then lots of people eating killed things for food is also OK.  So there are two reasonable points of discussion 1) Is is OK to kill living creatures to eat as food (I think we should, they are tasty)  2) If the answer to 1 is yes then do we also have a moral or ethical obligation surrounding our treatment of these things before we kill and eat them?",1267649477

Everybody else takes it for granted that doctors don't have any useful information on living a healthy life.  A doctor is just somebody who diagnoses and prescribes.  My friend got his head stuffed chock full of arcane knowledge in medical school, and he gets a torrent of ""education"" from drug companies, but when it comes to the effect of lifestyle on health, he's less educated than most of my yuppie friends.<p>This is a waste, because the people who are in the best position to understand and evaluate information about living a healthy lifestyle have no influence on the production or consumption of this information, except when they themselves get in on the business.",1267648810

We have destroyed our planet and its inhabitants beyond comprehension, and people like you -- likely among the more intelligent of our precious and wonderful species -- cannot find it in their self-pronounced greatness to be <i>good</i>. We are extremely important in that we annually torture and kill 50 billion fellow animals, sensitive creatures all, for the sake of our own convenience and culturally imputed preferences.<p>So yes, we are extremely important. Catastrophically so.<p>And by the way, your species-ism is shamelessly fallacious. You are not better or correct or more valuable simply because you belong to homo sapiens, and your fellow species members are not better or correct or more valuable simply because they belong to the same species as you do.<p>Moreover, comparing human value to pig value in support of factory farming is a complete canard. It's a moot point whether or not humans are ""more"" valuable, because we do not need to factory farm other creatures in order to live healthy, happy lives ourselves. Indeed, factory farming will be a primary reason why humans in the future will have horrible lives indeed, on a hellscape formerly known as the green planet.<p>(2) ""The animals are domesticated, therefore are part of a symbiotic relationship in which they get to live fairly well, without so much worrying about getting to eat, breed etc, in exchange for being docile, and eaten at the end of the road.""<p>You are so amazingly incorrect about this. The animals do not ""live well."" Here is a sampling of what is routinely done to animals on factory farms, in no particular order: confinement in spaces so tight they can't move; traumatic mutilation, including tail-docking, hole-punching, de-beaking, and castration; living in piss and feces, their own and others; rampant disease; unnatural food, including corn and other animal product waste, that causes them to be sick and so overweight that their bones break; and many more abuses besides. The animals literally go insane after a short while, and you would too, believe me. And yes, then, after they have lived in these conditions for they are slaughtered.<p>""A symbiotic relationship?"" ""Living well?"" Couldn't be further from reality.",1267648621

1165075,comment,1164137,1164492,0,0,potatolicious,,,"Honestly, I think software people have a largely skewed view of the patent system in general. I used to be in traditional engineering (mechanical/electrical to be precise), and the amount of R&D dollars that has to go into any major innovation is astronomical.<p>The amount of testing, regulatory costs, tooling costs, etc etc, makes bringing an innovative thing to market very, very expensive indeed. Most of these things are also trivially easy to reverse engineer - the patent is the only thing preventing a company's competitors from cloning the tech, avoiding all of the costs associated, and discouraging innovation overall.<p>The trick is software patents - software largely doesn't <i>cost</i> a lot, not compared to big heavy machinery requiring onerous certification and government authorizations. 3 guys hacking for a month straight is peanuts compared to, say, the amount of money it would cost to bring a new fuel injection system to market, yet the software these guys produce can be equally valuable from a marketability perspective. This is where patents fall apart - the point of the patent system is to encourage R&D spending by allowing protection of its results, because being simply first to market is not a large enough advantage in many industries to be profitable. It is, however, true in software, so I'm personally dubious of software patents in general.<p>Just some perspective - I dislike the ""patents are evil, always, every way!"" kneejerk reaction.

A burning itch to know is higher than a solemn vow to pursue truth. To feel the burning itch of curiosity requires both that you be ignorant, and that you desire to relinquish your ignorance. If in your heart you believe you already know, or if in your heart you do not wish to know, then your questioning will be purposeless and your skills without direction. Curiosity seeks to annihilate itself; there is no curiosity that does not want an answer. The glory of glorious mystery is to be solved, after which it ceases to be mystery.

So, for $2K that gets you 13 to 20 hours of development.<p>For that, I think you <i>might</i> be able to implement one of the features you mentioned but not all of them.<p>I've had good luck finding developers at AuthenticJobs.

What is expected of them is to get good grades, and since that is possible through rote almost all of my peers take that route. If you ask them in a moment of honesty they say; ""why should I do it? I'll just get the grades get into a good college a good job... Why should I waste my time learning this?"".<p>I used to gripe about the system whenever I heard that reply and why they just didn't get it, but now I realize that they are simply reflecting society in general.

Most teachers hardly give a damn about teaching and they aren't even remotely interested in science.

I'm surprised they don't allow people to buy albums within the app, honestly, because I've purchased at least three albums because I first heard the song on Tap Tap (the iPad version, in my case).<p>I imagine it's mostly licensing issues and the fact that this would set up Tap Tap as a competitor to iTunes, which would surely get them booted out of the App Store.<p>It's best to think of Tap Tap as an entertainment factory, which (I'm guessing) is why Disney is so interested in it.

I'm not a designer, but there's a few things that stood out to me when I clicked on your website.<p>First, there's too much text. The text is overpowering me. 
I forget where, but there was an article/blog post a week or so that I read, which effectively said:<p>1. Assume your readers can't read<p>2. Assume even if they can read, they won't.<p>This means that ideally your site should be almost self explanatory. Diagrams > Words if you need to choose. If you can illustrate to me how it works, you're doing way better than having me read it.<p>Next, your choice of color is bad. Nothing really stands out except ""by trying apps on your iPhone"". That is to say:<p>""Earn money"" doesn't stand out. Login doesn't stand out, and neither does Register...<p>Next, in the ""Get paid to try apps"" paragraph, the color scheme isn't ""crisp"", it's a bit hard to read IMO.<p>""Are you a developer?"" Why yes I am! But holy-moly, that font is fine and i'm not even at the fine print yet! 
Don't try to squeeze so much text onto your website :)<p>Next thing that stood out to me, is the >> Login/Register buttons. They have this odd white color to them on the left side and the top sides. It makes them feel like they were poorly photoshopped, and even though it's tiny (pixel wise), it's super noticable to me<p>Finally, you really have no ""call to action"". I arrive to your page, and I don't know where to click next. This is mostly because your Register button blends in with everything else. I'd probably make the registration red here to contrast with everything else (others may disagree, but I think the color needs to change). 
Forget about the login button. your battle is against people clicking the back button when they first arrive. If they register, you've essentially got them to buy in. They'll find where to login :) (you can put it in the corner, or anywhere else really).<p>I hope this is useful, good luck! :)<p>edit: cleaned up my thoughts a little bit...",1278022976

1479429,comment,1477868,1478888,0,0,kragen,,,"Most of that stuff has to do with improvements in the hardware. The original Macintosh's GUI was somewhat limited by the hardware.<p>CPU: Remember Cringely's story of how before Apple fired him, the last thing he did was to implement an animation of flies buzzing around the trashcan to indicate that it was full, which took 30% of the CPU. And it's a lot easier to do transparency and perspective transforms if you have a GPU to run them on.<p>Pre-emptive multitasking: pre-emptive multitasking takes up very little code (you just need an interrupt handler that saves one set of registers and restores another set) but it's more error-prone to program on than cooperative multitasking. Its usefulness is that no task can hang the whole computer. But on a machine without an MMU, like the original Mac, any task programmed in an unsafe language can crash the whole computer, so that's worthless. Even preemptive-multitasking OSes that use the MMU effectively (with locks, facilities for limited shared memory, message queues, and so on) can be quite small.<p>Oberon was a system more or less contemporary with the Mac with hierarchical file management, networking, hypertext, networked file transfer, and a GUI (although obviously not an FTP client, a Web browser, or transparency and perspective transforms) that was similar in size.<p>So why are our other systems so much more code? Here are some of my guesses.<p>â€¢ You can always do something better (faster, in a more general way, with better error reporting, covering that last little detail of the CSS standard, whatever) in 10Ã— the code. So people do.<p>â€¢ In big and old systems, in order to keep communication overhead to a manageable level, people duplicate code â€” either because they don't know it already exists, or because they don't understand the code that depends on it well enough not to break it when they change what it depends on, or just because changing the interface is so much work. (In theory, you could migrate all Motif applications to use GTK, with enough work on them.) I'm not saying this is justifiable in systems of merely a few million lines of code, but in systems like Debian, up in the billions of lines, it's unavoidable.<p>â€¢ Big and old systems also have lots of code of minimal utility. Do you know about Xdmcp? Your X server does. How about X resource parsing? Lots of your programs are still linked with Xt. How about the xbm file format, to say nothing of three quarters of the formats supported by netpbm and ImageMagick? Handling for printing teletypes that can't erase? Handling of terminals with no lowercase? Hardware-accelerated non-antialiased rendering of polygons? Video cards that have separate palettes for the red, green, and blue color channels (""DirectColor"")? Xcms? Have you ever looked at the random crap in terminfo? Did you know that Microsoft Windows machines still have fields in struct sockaddr_in for IMP numbers, in case you're on the ARPANet? And when was the last time you needed magnetic tape handling programs? Did you know Emacs still comes with notes on how to port Mocklisp to it?",1278022129

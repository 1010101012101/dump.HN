6456333,comment,6456003,6456003,11,0,Systemic33,,,"There is a really interesting comment on reddit regarding this survey, specifically about how dodgy its methods was.<p>&quot;This is not me saying that this is a bad study because I&#x27;m a Microsoft fanboy. This is me saying this is a bad study because I&#x27;m a scientist.<p>The &quot;study&quot; says that &quot;cognitive load is the sum of elements a user needs to be familiar with in order to use the operating system.&quot; That&#x27;s actually a good thing to look at, and would be interesting. Unfortunately, they counted the number of pre-installed applications and decided that was somehow linked to the cognitive load? I don&#x27;t even begin to see a connection between the two.<p>In the &quot;efficiency and integration&quot; section, they do not actually run a study to see how quickly different tasks can be done (which would be efficiency) -and I don&#x27;t see anything about integration at all- instead they simply talk about how many short cuts there are- except on Android, which is docked for having too many short cuts.<p>The customization section showcases 2 problems. 1. They assume that more customization is always better and 2. If what you&#x27;re going for is customization, than you better make Android a 10 and the next highest operating system a 2. The fact that they have Android and iOS7 anywhere close together shows they did not use any methodology for assigning score.<p>And finally, the UFX score. I don&#x27;t even know where to begin. First, he claims that you can close applications on iOS7 and Android to &quot;free up resources,&quot; but in reality both camps have said explicitly that their app launcher does not control resource use. He claims that iOS 7 can fit 24 application shortcuts, while Windows Phone can barely fit 12. In reality, if all you want is icons with counters (which is all iOS 7 offers you) then you can fit 28 icons on Windows Phone. He also complains about not having a background image on Windows Phone, never once mentioning how you wouldn&#x27;t be able to see it (he also lists this under UFX- not sure how this causes any friction. Anyway, he also list this under customization (which makes more sense) and double counts this as a negative). And the oddest one- he claims that the Lumia 920 has &quot;sponsored links on the homescreen.&quot; I don&#x27;t have a Lumia 920- so I can&#x27;t speak from personal experience, but none of my Google searches reveal anything about this and it is something that I am quite sure would be railed against frequently if true. So in that case, I&#x27;m pretty sure it is a lie.<p>Now, that being said- there are of course problems with Windows Phone. However, I really don&#x27;t think this article captured any of them.&quot; - Weed_O_Whirler",1380279282

You need to store all your data in &quot;pages&quot;. These are fixed-length blocks (that can be chained together).<p>2. Use a classical &quot;dictionary&quot; data structure to store your index (most use B-Tree), but you place that structure on-disk instead of in-memory. Your index basically points a key to the index of the first page that contains the value.<p>3. You may need to store other types of data in the file, such as the free page list.<p>As for geo-location, B-Tree fits nicely here.<p>1. Intelligently lay out your B-Tree so that nearby nodes are typically within the same node-family-system. Include information about the distance spanned by descendants in the tree (you probably want to use Manhatten distance).<p>2. When trying to do &quot;near&quot; queries, first locate the node you are interested in and then start traversing up the parents until you find the ancestor that encompasses the distance you are looking for.<p>3.

Also, they patched the kernel not to touch these registers at all.

The last few conferences I&#x27;ve been to (Division on Planetary Sciences, European Planetary Science Congress, American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting) have highlighted how worried publishers like Elsevier are about the changing attitudes in the field. I&#x27;ve been to a number of dedicated PR seminars at these conferences, where it is clear that the pitch is that publishers that require payment for the publication of scientific papers are not preventing taxpayers from gaining access to results, but are rather simply seeking appropriate compensation for their efforts in coordinating peer-review processes and bringing the results to the attention of the wider community.<p>I very openly tell my colleagues that change is necessary to make it clear that investment in missions like MSL, MESSENGER, JUICE etc. is for the mutual benefit of everyone. I think as a scientist, I have an OBLIGATION to communicate my results to those that make my work possible.<p>Open access journals are making some headway, but unfortunately, until the bigwigs in the field really make a clear statement of intent to shift from the traditional publishing houses to these new publishers, the status quo will be maintained.<p>I applaud the OP&#x27;s efforts to make these results accessible to to everyone, and sincerely hope that there are no legal repercussions.",1380278163

If you do not want the featured selection, you tell them via a return card or their website.<p>An example is the Science Fiction Book Club [1]. The front page has a link to a &quot;how it works&quot; page [2]. Note that the &quot;how it works&quot; page doesn&#x27;t actually tell you about the negative response aspect. It tells you to read the membership agreement for complete details and links to the agreement [3]. It is in there that you get the details of automatically receiving the featured selection.<p>(Things are similar for the Book of the Month Club, the Scientific American Book Club, and a whole bunch of others--because they are all actually run by the same company, and are using the same template for their web sites. The Columbia House DVD Club too).<p>Compare this to the JustFab page. That too has a &quot;how it works&quot; page [4], which is linked to from the front page. That page tells you about the negative response part.<p>The front page of the book club does say, when touting the initial book offer, that it is &quot;with membership&quot;, so it is clear on the front page that you are going to probably have to sign up for some kind of membership to get that deal. The JustFab page does not make it clear that you must become a member to purchase.<p>With the book club, if you fail to make your negative response, you get a book not of your choosing. With JustFab, you get a credit that you can use on an item of your choosing. My guess is that the vast majority of JustFab&#x27;s customers buy several times a year, and so they are able to fairly quickly put the credit to use.<p>So why does JustFab draw so much more fire, when the seem ostensibly quite similar to the book club? I wonder if the fact that their subscription if for credits makes a big difference? The book club pushes a featured selection each month, presumably something they have made a volume deal for in order to get a good price. For this to work, they really need their featured selections to sell well. With JustFab, the credit is generic. If they need to push some specific item in order to support a good price for it, selling credits does not help. Would people find JustFab more acceptable if instead of a credit, they actually sent you an item once a month?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sfbc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sfbc.com</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.sfbc.com/howitworks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sfbc.com/howitworks</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.sfbc.com/membership-agreement"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sfbc.com/membership-agreement</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.justfab.com/how-justfab-works.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justfab.com/how-justfab-works.htm</a>",1380277279

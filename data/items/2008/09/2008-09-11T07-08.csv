2. Background image is yeck. You'd be better off with a lighter grey than the current image.
3. Headings would look better without small-caps<p>Other than that, seams good! Still testing the app atm.",1221119715

301223,comment,300485,300513,0,0,jrockway,,,"I don't think this is the issue.  You could easily give each developer a Haskell module to flesh out, like:<p><pre><code>    foo :: Foo -> (Bar -> Baz) -> Quux
    hello :: IO
    this :: Is -> Starting -> To Get -> Boring
</code></pre>
Arguably the restrictions they are bound to are much stricter than with Java.<p>But anyway, I don't think most Java programmers really ""get"" OO.  So OO is not the reason they use Java -- there is something else.  Probably a lot of marketing from Sun; constantly hearing about ""certification"" and whatnot makes the managers happy.",1221119359

It's better to burn coal and buy a few trees than it is to just burn the coal, right?<p>While I don't think that carbon offsetting is going to solve any long-term problems, it is nice to plant some trees and have a bit more money poured into renewable energy research.<p>We're not going to see real change until we are out of coal and oil.  Hopefully that will happen soon.  (Yes, it will be painful.   But the sooner the pain starts, the sooner it will be over with.)",1221118945

301216,comment,300920,301110,0,0,jrockway,,,"Remember that the set of ""any programmer"" is pretty big.  It probably happens by not spending much time programming.  Or by not noticing your bad habits.<p>I think most ""kids"" today can type pretty well because it's essential for IM-ing.  I know that's how I learned to type quickly.  Older people might not do much real-time communication, so they might not know how slow their ad-hoc typing is.",1221118623

301212,comment,300920,301178,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>programming takes place in the mind of the programmer, typing on the screen is a byproduct</i><p>As he says in the article, the actual programming is not what requires much typing.  It's communicating with others on IRC (or e-mail, whatever you kids use these days), typing documentation, writing blog posts, etc. that require typing skills.<p>I will agree with him on this.  I don't type much when actually programming, but I do type a lot when talking with people on IRC (including co-workers, since we all work from home) and writing documentation.  And writing HN comments :)",1221118362

The skiplist approach is dependent on the (random) structure of the built-up skiplist. A given item could be found after 2 pointer traversals, or it could take 30. Also disturbing is that as you get closer to the item you're looking for, the string comparisons take longer and longer (because the common prefixes are getting longer and longer).<p>With a good hashing algorithm, similar strings will hash to different values. This means that even if 2 or 3 string comparisons have to be made (for strings that land in the same bucket), failing comparisons will be fast since they will likely fail on the first character.",1214585925

229911,comment,229640,229640,0,0,brentr,,,"I read things everyday about what's better: Windows or something else. The truth is each OS has its own plusses and minuses. Linux/Unix allows a sophisticated user much more power than Windows. Windows has a whole network of developers that create the mainstream games and other entertainment software I enjoy. I use both a Unix and a Windows system, but I use both in a very different manner.<p>Regardless of one's opinion on what OS is better, you cannot deny that Gates is one of the most brilliant people of our time. His business practices are what brought him wealth. He may or may not have done a few questionable things, but what business hasn't? This is why we have a justice system. Laws are not always written to be black and white. The justice systme is there to help us define all the gray in between.<p>If I had the ability to create a monopoly because the laws don't explicitly define a certain prohibition, you can bet your ass that I would. I'd deal with antitrust issues as they came up and leverage what I have already done to move into a new area of exploitation. Whether or not you want to believe it, that is how capitalism is practiced.",1214585861

I forgot how ""Please wait..."" popups looked like.<p>After that, it's been declining ever since: my software has gotten slower and slower, and web sites started to bring back dial-up memories from mid-90s.<p>After switching to Linux I got back most of what I lost, but the web still feels much slower, even Gmail is giving me ""Still working..."" strip at the top on a daily basis and randomly 1-2 squares on google maps remain gray after initial page load: hard to bitch about free stuff though.",1214585855
229909,comment,229668,229839,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Yes, the size <i>could</i> be computed that way. However, I was going by the original paper in my implementation. This meant that I had to first estimate how many items would be in the tree, then take the base-2-log of that (in order to get O(lg n) performance), and then make <i>each</i> node allocate that many pointers. Of course, with most nodes, most of these pointers are uninitialized and unused.<p>In my comment, I was referring to my (and the reference) implementation. After reading your comment, though, you're right that you could allocate a number of pointers equal to the height of the specific node. The only downside is that you then have two mallocs for each new node (once for the node and once for its array of pointers), unless you do something hackish like putting the array of pointers at the end of the struct and manually adjusting your malloc call to allocate the right amount.<p>One other note: I don't think my skiplist was doubly-linked. The search algorithm involves moving forward on the highest level until the move would take you past the desired element, then you move down a level and continue. By the time you hit the bottom, you're guaranteed to either hit the element you're looking for, or your position is the node before where the element would be if it was in the list. Thus double-linking is entirely unnecessary.",1214585809

While I think Microsoft does a fine job of security R&D, the tend to massively fail when it comes time to actually deliver.<p>At a fundamental level, simplicity of mechanism has to be part of any secure system. Every major MS stack (Windows kernel+core API, IE+ActiveX+JScript, Office+VBA) is just too huge, and has too many little back doors around the security infrastructure built in for performance and backwards-compatibility.<p>Now, if they truly willing to commit to using a substrate like Singularity for their trusted computing base, we can talk about security.<p>The better way to handle this, of course, is separate browser runtimes for separate applications, ala Prism/XULRunner. Each desktop app should have a whitelist of hosts it's allowed to access, and sharing can be accomplished via normal local system channels.",1214585750

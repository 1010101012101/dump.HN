A good team can change product-focus, change market-focus, create products, occasionally even <i>create</i> markets.<p>A bad team is hopeless and will stay that way into perpetuity.",1182868623

30804,comment,30776,30800,0,0,budu3,,,"Well there's nothing wrong with a simple design. As long as it helps get the user what they want. It's got that craigslist feel to it. I just think (s)he needs to improve the usability. As a user I wanna be uploading/sharing/viewing pics in as few steps as possible. I found the demo lacking and I had to log out of the demo, then go back ""hosting plan"" to sign up, then wait 20 mins for my email before I could start using the service. That being said, keep up the good work. As for your business model, I don't think I'm qualified to comment on that.",1182868344

The last time I looked it up on Urban Dictionary there were roughly 40 million conflicting definitions.  I think using terms like that in this essay is unwise and confuses her points.",1182867878

It looks like your design was trying for zen-like simplicity but instead just looks amateurish. There is much wrong with the design, and instead of posting a short novel on the subject I would recommend googling ""basic design principles"" or going into your local Barnes & Noble and finding the same.<p>Beyond that, I would also criticize your choice of domain name. It is good that you are using real words in your domain name, but the words ""ourdoing"" has nothing to do with photos, time or email, which I take it is the essence what you are offering. A domain like ""bestphotoemail.com"" would serve you better even if its not your brand name.<p>I do like your logo, conceptually at least. It needs work and should be more prominent.",1182867196

People seem to like the community aspect of flickr, for instance, and they lose that if they go to your site.<p>That said, yeah, there's probably a lot of people who don't put their photos on line yet who might go for something less 'cool'.

Smash hits like Netscape and Google are rare - most of the companies that we hear of today got their foot in the door, then used that to expand upwards into bigger markets.  I wonder if Microsoft would've gotten YC funding if YC had been around in 1975: I can see them getting back a little note with ""Interesting idea, but most of your users can write their own BASIC interpreter.  Also, you'll probably end up going back to Harvard at the end of the summer.""",1182866642

3001086,comment,3000383,3000877,10,0,ansy,,,"IANAL, but arbitration clauses are standard in contracts[1] at least in the United States. Arbitration is generally seen as preferred because suing people is actually very expensive.<p>In Sony's favor, Sony excluded small claims. So for pretty much everyone this arbitration clause is meaningless. The limit for small claims is in the thousands of dollars (depending on state) [2]. The circumstances where Sony would be liable for more than a few thousand to a single consumer would have to be pretty extraordinary.<p>Also in Sony's favor, Sony did not choose to use the arbitration clause to set an onerous jurisdiction. Sony could have said all arbitration needed to take place in a specific city in the middle of nowhere. Sony didn't even pick the location of its headquarters; you can pick any jurisdiction. Most arbitration clauses I've seen set a jurisdiction that favors the contract writer, so I'd say this puts Sony in a decent light for not doing the same.<p>If you really wanted to find fault with Sony's particular arbitration clause, it would be that it is binding. Neither side can appeal the decision of the arbitration panel to a higher court. But keep in mind this cuts both ways, and it really isn't unusual. It is even endorsed in the United States.<p>I should also note that arbitration clauses can be voided if the panel can be proven to be biased. So this isn't necessarily a license for Sony to circumvent the law, at least against a well funded opponent. And anyone with the balls to sue Sony for any serious amount of money would be a well funded opponent.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration_clause"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration_clause</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/small-claims-suits-how-much-30031.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/small-claims-suits-ho...</a>",1316105784

I recently interviewed with the country head of a large MNC for a geography account manager's role. Five minutes in, he said he flat out loathed sales guys who would also make cold calls to sell. ""It's irritating. It's illegal. And I don't know why you do it.""<p>The other assumption he made was this: since I sell, it's unlikely that I was technical as well. And that was that. I am a little taken aback that such dinosaurs exist. Selling is hard, even more so when people in delivery just don't trust you to sell on their behalf.<p>I am still recovering from what was probably the shortest interview in my career.

While Martin Luther King Jr. strongly based his views on equality and social rights in his religious faith.<p>What I have difficulty disambiguating is the effect of specifically Saudi oil money promoting the Wahhabism, which seeks a pure Moslem faith, vs. the other Moslem faiths. I also have to believe that the history of British and French control (eg, the Sykes-Picot Agreement) plus the US involvement in Operation Ajax hasn't helped promote democracy.

For me, this is a really interesting point that this article doesn't fully get. When you use WinRT you might be using the C# compiler, CLR runtime and .NET string & collection classes, but there are huge sections of the .NET BCL that now look like a lame duck. WinRT is the new way to do XML, JSON, HTTP, networking, security, globalisation, threading, printing...

Won't the WinRT version gradually become the preferred way of doing JSON in both environments, with the .NET BCL existing to fill in the server side only gaps?",1316104526

I went to Catholic school during K-12 while the rest of my friends went to public school in Brooklyn and Queens, NY.

Teachers that live in the cities with large populations get paid nothing and they will not go out of their way for their students, which is needed. I was in a similar situation as you. I had lousy teachers making a lot of money and I came away learning particularly nothing from them. The school itself had protected me from outside influence which allowed me to learn on my own. Most of my friends, which came from the now defunct Jackson H.S. in Queens, have become drug dealers, ended up in jail, died or never went to college. These are people of white, black, Asian and Indian descent. The only friend that made anything of himself went to Brooklyn Tech and is now a medical teacher at Harvard.

(FYI, Emacs has been my primary editor for 5 years and Vim has been my over-ssh editor for 6)<p>Your guitar analogy is more applicable not between Emacs and Vim but between something like pico/nano and vim/emacs. It's hard to find a good analogy between Emacs and Vim because they are both awesome editors for many different reasons.<p>Emacs (due to its LISP origins) is highly configurable, probably the <i>most</i> configurable piece of software you will ever use that has a large mindshare and presence in the community. Vim is configurable, but Vim's intention from the beginning was to be an efficient editor over SSH; it just so happens people are now using it as their primary editor of choice on their desktops.<p>With Vim you can't just start editing text right away (like Emacs, Word, TextEdit &c...) you have to switch from the Console Mode into Editing Mode (by pressing ""i"" on most installs). Then if you want to delete a few words you have to switch back to the Console Mode (by pressing ""esc"" usually) position your cursor, and enter ""wq"" until the words you wanted deleted are deleted. This has the benefit of separating commands from text editing so there are no ""control"" keys as you will see with Emacs.<p>With Emacs you can edit text right away and there are no ""modes"" to change. Emacs instead has control keys (the two main ones are ""C"" and ""M"" - on your keyboard that's ""Control"" and ""Alt"" - I've remapped my control key to be the Caps Lock key since it makes my pinky finger less angry). So if while I'm editing I wanted to delete a few words, I would position my cursor then hold down Alt and press ""d"" until the words I wanted deleted are deleted (in emacs lingo: ""M-d""). This has the benefit of not ""context"" switching into other modes but it means you now have to be very clever with your key combinations so you don't end up playing Twister! on your keyboard for more complicated tasks (that's why some people prefer Vim because it negates that problem with ""modes"").<p>Emacs doesn't <i>want</i> to be an MP3 player - Emacs wants to be whatever the <i>person using it</i> wants it to be. To me that's what wins me over to Emacs; if I need my editor to do something that it doesn't do stock, I have the full power to add/change/remove whatever it is I want it to do. Additionally there's an enormous community of people with far more knowledge and experience in doing that to tap into, plus, if you want it do something it's most likely someone already has done (and done it better).<p>Vim also doesn't want to be an MP3 player - matter of fact, you would get stoned by the Vim community for saying that, those guys are all about efficiency. I love Vim because of its efficiency - I actually really hate Emacs over SSH (to all those saying ""use TRAMP!"" I have, and it's not nearly as cool as using Vim over SSH). My editor of choice when working directly on a server editing code is Vim, it's fast, concise, and very powerful.<p>There is no editor war today - there's the never ending jihad between annoying emacs users and vim users that think their editor of choice is better than the other (I think those people are stupid, because BOTH EDITORS ARE AMAZING and EVERYONE HAS A DIFFERENT PREFERENCE). Technical people use editors that empower them to write software; people who don't want to think about text editing are still keyboard pecking when writing their emails.",1316103661

His corporate brand likely does so much work for him that he's possibly forgotten just how hard it is to generate leads.<p>For example, I have a buddy who's climbing the ladder at Cisco, and qualified leads are always banging at their door. The hardest part is done for them -- he just needs to work with them to find the right solution to the problem, which is the rewarding part.<p>On the other hand, I do sales at a startup as a cofounder. 99% of my time is trying to find customers. Emails and calls are necessary evils -- I hate doing them, but what am I supposed to do? Just wait for people to come to us? They've never heard of my company, and its a risk to work with a startup. So, the bulk of my time with them, if I get them on the phone, is convincing them that my boutique firm can over serve the big players. Also, I don't have a ""team"" behind me -- I do everything. Opening, qualifying, meetings, closing, negotiating contracts. Your MNC interviewer has likely never had to do all of these things.<p>I also have to be technical -- I don't have a technical background, but I'm having to learn as fast als possible. It comes down to learning the costomers poblems faster, knowing the idiosyncrasies of my product, and being able to discuss solutions without having to ""go back to my tech team,"" which is common with bigcos.<p>In all, its just the fundamental difference between large and small organizations.

3000887,comment,2999096,2999412,85,0,gecko,,,"I think you're looking at it wrong.  Let me walk you through what I see/saw as someone who's been an active Linux, Windows, and Mac user since about 1996.<p>In 1993, I'd write a Windows 3.1 app with Win16, a Mac app with the Mac Toolbox, and a Linux app with one of Athena, Xlib, or (I don't remember if this was around at the time) Motif.<p>In 1996, I would have made some trivial modifications to my Win16 app to make a Win32 app for Windows NT or 95 (and Microsoft made this a lot easier with things like message crackers and typedefs); my Mac app would need a recompile to target PowerPC, but otherwise be fine; and my Linux app still requires no changes either.  So far, so good.<p>By 2001, my Windows app still works perfectly.  It'll look dated unless I make some changes to the manifest to indicate that I'm ready for the new common controls, but this is pretty straightforward to do; it's not a big rewrite.  I can start heavily using COM without rewriting my whole code-base.  My Mac app will have required a port to Carbon--significantly more work than the Win16 to Win32 migration, but not horrible, and my app's now native for the upcoming OS X.<p>But Linux?  Wow.  I mean, I guess I can keep running my app--it executes--but no one uses Athena, no use uses raw Xlib.  I really need to port to Gtk+ 1.2 or Qt 2.0 if I want to look anything vaguely close to acceptable.  And this is a <i>major</i> rewrite for me to undertake; they look very little like their predecessors.  Yes, the toolkits are open-source, and yes, they still <i>work</i>, but let's be real here: I need to rewrite.<p>Let's move forward to 2005.  My Win32 app <i>still works</i>, without changes.  Granted, I might want to start using the nascent .NET, but Managed C++ and COM interop makes that pretty easy to accomplish piecemeal.  On the Mac side, the writing's getting on the wall that Carbon's going to die, so I'm going to want to start porting to Cocoa, and that amounts to basically a full rewrite.  I'm also going to want to start porting my app to Intel.<p>And on the Linux side, I've got to move to Gtk+ 2.0 or Qt 4.0.  And that's again a <i>big deal</i>.  If you weren't using Gtk+ or Qt back then, you should know that it was (at least in my opinion) a relatively large amount of work to upgrade.  Not a full rewrite, mind you, but Qt redid piles of classes, methods, and hierarchy, and Gtk+ introduced glib, reworked signalling, themes, and tons else I'm forgetting.  It was a lot of work.<p>Jump to 2010.  My Win32 app fucking <i>still works</i>.  Managed C++ is really mature right now.  And if I wrote C# or VB or anything in WinForms, it'll also still work, and it can use COM objects I export from my old C++ app, and expose COM objects to my old C++ app.  My Mac app, rewritten in Cocoa, still works fine, as long as I ported it to Intel, too; otherwise, users can't easily run it without installing Rosetta, an automated, if separate, install.  I'm also going to be seriously thinking about trying to get it also running on Cocoa Touch for the i* devices, which have a radically different GUI toolkit.  On the Linux side, the GUI of my app should still be in fairly good shape, although G-d help me if I did anything involving sound or 3D effects, since that API's gone through many wholesale changes in the last few years.  And if I didn't write plain Qt and Gtk, but instead using GNOME and KDE, then...wow.  I've had a lot of pain.  I went through to KDE 4, which was a <i>huge</i> deal.<p>Now, we're leaving out that, in the 2005-2010 timeframe, Microsoft introduced WPF and Silverlight.  So let's assume, in addition to my old C++ app that still works, I've now also got a few Silverlight and WPF apps I've written.<p>Now it's 2011.  What happens on these three platforms?<p>On the Mac side, I'm in the same place: I need to be <i>really</i> thinking about Cocoa Touch, but my existing Cocoa app still works fine.  If I didn't port to Intel, my app is dead, but that wasn't hard, so let's assume I did it.<p>On the Linux side, having gone through the KDE 4 transition, I'm now dealing with the GNOME 3 and/or Ubuntu-being-a-weirdo transition.<p>On the Windows side, in Windows 8, <i>my old app still runs.</i>  My Silverlight apps and my WinForms apps and my WPF apps <i>still run</i>.  The bad news is that they run in the legacy Windows desktop.  So now, what has to happen to fix that?<p>My C++ app's GUI is fucked.  Total rewrite.  Really total, even worse than the Gtk+ 1.2 to 2.0 transition.  WinForms, too.  They're not coming to Metro.<p>But my Silverlight and WPF apps?  Are you serious?  It's <i>very</i> little work to get these running on Metro.  Metro uses XAML really heavily, and has a very Silverlight-like view of the .NET libraries, actually.  Most of the changes I'm going to make are mechanical and look-and-feel.  This isn't <i>trivial</i>, but it's at worst a lot easier (IMHO) than the movement from Gtk 1.2 to 2.0 or Qt 3 to 4.<p>So you know what?  At the end of the day, Microsoft looks <i>really good</i> to me.  Great binary backwards compatibility, and really good toolkit compatibility.  They've given me a really clean migration path from Silverlight/WPF to Metro that does most definitively not require a full rewrite.  This is better than both other platforms listed above.<p>Me?  I'll take it.",1316102899

Disruptive technologies, they were not...just recycling things that we have seen before with some twist, but generally the same.  Not to say that the founders did not put a lot of time, sweat and tears into their companies - I'm sure they did and I applaude them.  But if the bar for mediocrity is such, then venues such TC Disrupt will see many more startups like these - they set the precedence (but it's not entirely their fault), and the upcoming startups will continue to look more like the ones the year before. I wonder what would happen if they didnt fund any one of startups...would we get more innovative entries the next round or no startups at all?  Just a thought.  As for Shaker, it's a take from Cyworld - a Korean social media in the early 2000's.  They didn't make it because, unlike Shaker, Cyworld did not have a social media platform like FB to work from for their contacts and links.  I think Shaker is a very cool alternative for social interactions...hope they make it.",1316102515

That means until either the software patent madness is fixed or organisations like Mozilla start putting up hard cash, their integrated video functionality will never be as good as what you can get in something like IE (or, apparently, Chrome, since Google seem to have quietly dropped their policy of discontinuing support for H.264).<p>> Could you cite or give examples of these [font bugs in Firefox]?<p>On Windows systems, the kerning is very odd in a lot of fonts since they moved to the new rendering engine a while back. The spacing following a capital T is usually way too tight, and in some fonts there are a few other examples as well. This can render pages completely illegible at typical body text sizes.<p>Also, take a Windows 7 computer with a few Adobe professional OpenType fonts installed locally -- probably some that come with Creative Suite would do -- and just try selecting those fonts using CSS in recent versions of Firefox. It simply doesn't work and falls back to the next font family in the list, though the same page will find the fonts and render quite happily in other browsers on Windows 7, or in the same version of Firefox on Windows XP for that matter.<p>Most currently available web fonts also seem to look terrible (poorly hinted, terrible aliasing) on Windows XP in Firefox, but since they don't look great in other browsers either and they look better in Firefox on Windows 7, I'm inclined to point the finger more at Windows XP than Firefox in that case.",1316102495

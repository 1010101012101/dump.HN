The fact is that there's still a lot of value that can be added on top of what EC2 offers.<p>For example, Heroku I'm sure will offer monitoring, backups, high-availability setup for webheads and databases, etc.  That has added value to it and with EC2 you'd have to have several boxes to achieve that.<p>Plus, one thing that is oft-overlooked is burstability.  With Heroku, you might have a pool that averages out to the capacity of 1 EC2 instance, but bursts higher.  That's important. That means that you don't have to plan for peak capacity as much since their system will auto-adapt to handle it.<p>You could make a similar setup, but it wouldn't be cheap as you'd need multiple EC2 instances to handle what Heroku is giving you in terms of high-availability. Heroku isn't for everyone and it'll probably be a premium, but when you're a business that wants to stay up (vs. something where it doesn't matter if your reliability is a little lower) it's probably going to be a nice service.<p>It costs a lot of money to move from 99.5% to 99.9% or 99.99%.  At 99.5%, you can just run one box and fire up a new instance when you realize that it went down.  To get to 4 nines, you need monitoring, hot failovers, etc.",1236192063

There is a lot of ""fu"" that goes into how Google decides what results to return for a given search, and how Google decides what page or site is the most authoritative for a given search. While nobody knows the exact recipe, everyone seems to agree that your domain name plays into the algorithm significantly.  When you spread your content across domains, you're essentially diluting the search value you can achieve for a given query.  Maybe it doesn't matter today, because you rank very high now, but that may not always be true.<p>The other reason is that people will bookmark your blog (if you're lucky ;) ).  What if you later decide to switch from wordpress.com to whoknowswhat.com?  What if wordpress goes out of business or shuts down for some reason?

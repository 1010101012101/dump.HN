Given the other tools available, and given what is valued here, TIR are no better then the comments they reply to.  Something you seem to be ignoring is value.  Value in terms of respect, and of time, both yours, and others.<p>A TIR post is not respectful.  It's used as an insult.  It's an open insults. Given that their are other, more effective means to communicate disapproval, and that be replying, you are removing those means from your arsenal, it's clear that your intent is merely to insult.<p>A TIR is not respectful to others.  By highlighting the post with further discussion, it wastes others time.  Not only are you not operating to remove the parent comment from the discussion, but you are asking people to read your comment in reply, and to judge the merits of what is now a discussion.  See, if the TIR post is left as is, then I <i>must</i> read the parent in order to understand context.  If the TIR post is left as is, it's also a symbol that the comment is a good comment, and worthy of reading.<p>Do not confuse the intended goal of a TIR.  I agree, the <i>intent</i> is good.  But even if it accomplishes it's goal of having the parent retract his statement, it does so in a manner that is immature and rude.  Being able to bully people into a position is not valuable.<p>I guess we'll continue to disagree on it's value.  That being said, HN has it's policies, and I tend to agree with them, and will continue to down vote both TIR posts and the posts they reply to.",1337255690

If the latter, you reduce the amount of time the table is locked whilst adding rows since there are no joins and lookups in the insert, and this may be more performant overall than the alternative.<p>You can also reduce the duration of any transaction lock you may need to hold for importing all the data which ultimately makes the system more responsive during large imports.

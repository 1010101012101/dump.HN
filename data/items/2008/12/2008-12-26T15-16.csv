These days, I don't think many employees will assume a company is loyal to them, therefore their default behavior will not be loyalty toward their employer.<p>The whole startup/VC relationship, when done well, aligns interests such that bi-directional loyalty becomes more of a win-win. In the same vein, employees with equity are more likely to be in a ""bi-directional loyalty"" relationship with their employer.<p>I also like Brad's one-mulligan rule. It recognizes that one breach can be a mistake; two is a pattern",1230307105

It was pretty nice, and relatively cheap.  And it had wifi.  Make sure the room you stay in (or wherever your hammock is going to be) gets good signal.  I couldn't get good stable signal in my room.  I had to sit out in the porch if I wanted to go online.  (Bring bug spray!)<p>You can stay/vacation in Thailand for relatively cheap.  I would recommend you stay on a beach if you can.  They have one of the best beaches in the world (not mainland beaches, but island beaches).  And definitely take a few days to go sight seeing.  Worth it =)<p>I'm interested in how this turns out for you.  Good luck.<p>ps If you don't get paid locally for your ""work"", I don't think you need a work visa.  And I use TripAdvisor.com for hotel reviews.",1230307028

410219,comment,410132,410132,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"I think I agree and also disagree here.<p>Richard Dawkins talk about how genes suited to doing well ""in average"" environments tend to be the ones preserved. In other words, evolution produces people good at whatever the average tasks are in their environment, so ""super heroes"" are unlikely to emerge from evolution, but, say, ""cubicle drones"" are. Mediocrity, or being able to ""fit in"" in the ""mean"" environment, is a good survival-predictor for genes.<p>So, to VC. ""Super hero"" VC's will indeed go away. Meaning the ""I'm investing in the latest dotcom craze and I am getting 25% or more annual returns"" sort is indeed perhaps nearly extinct. But the VC types that looks at the market demand and diversifies his investments for more modest (average) returns, is going to survive. For example, a VC firm heavy in high tech could well collapse in a tech recession. But a diversified VC firm that invests in ""essentials"", like say, natural gas, that is still going to be needed even in a recession, is probably going to ride out the recession.<p>So, if I am in VC, which I am not, but if I were, I would look at building a diverse portfolio heavily weighted towards things like natural gas, utilities in general, that kind of thing, stuff that won't go away easily. I would, in other words, try to be an ""average gene"", not a ""super hero gene"" because per Dawkins, the average gene will be more likely to survive. Stay diversified, stay conservative, tack towards utilities and ""essentials"" if in a recession, and you might be ""mediocre"", but at least you'll survive as a VC firm.<p>In a word Superman may be dead, but the selfish gene of mediocrity is alive and well. :-)",1230306970

In short: 1157 PhDs given out, and 761 have academic positions (the main place to get a job as a mathematician).</i><p>Actuaries, quant finance (it's not dead yet), crypto-related programming, logistics... there are lots of non-academic jobs (most of which pay better than all but the best academic appointments).

410199,comment,410180,410180,0,0,patio11,,,"While that may seem like a silly question, if Java and Ruby both lost the data structure entirely, my code would still function.  (The frameworks it runs on, not so much.)<p>It is sort of like a programmer not knowing what a NAND gate is.  You could get all crotchety about that, because he couldn't do a single thing without a NAND gate on his current system... but he really doesn't need to know the specifics.  Many types of programming (not all, obviously) have abstracted away memory management and have pitiful speed requirements compared to the capacity of hardware (and the bottlenecks don't happen anywhere near application code), and accordingly aside from syntactic inertia there is really not that much of a reason to care about arrays any more than there is to know about your NAND gates.<p>(Edit: It occurs to me that I could monkeypatch Array in Ruby and replace it with an associative array and my site would probably function fine...  Maybe I'll try it just to prove a point.)",1230305299

410186,comment,410080,410090,0,0,randomwalker,,,"You seriously need to appreciate the distinction between CS and coding. Let me break it down: computer science is really difficult. It's not the CS jobs that go to India. It's the coding jobs.<p>Also, here's something you many not know. K-12 CS education in India is actually pretty good. My school started computer science in the fifth grade. Internalizing the Turing machine (even if it is not formally explained) at that age gives you a huge advantage should you decide to become a computer scientist later.<p>So how come India doesn't produce good computer scientists? Actually we do. If you look at the top CS conferences, the proportion of Indians is pretty high compared to the number of people we graduate. It's just that Indians choose to move to the U.S. to do research because there are no good government funded research programs in India.<p>Next up, innovation and design. I think PG pretty much answered that one. It doesn't matter if you have talented people, if you don't have a nurturing environment like Silicon Valley, it's just not gonna happen. There's not much incentive for an Indian firm to innovate because our business climate is just so bad. Success depends more on how well you can bribe government officials than on innovation.<p>That leaves coding jobs. If you teach everyone how to code, of course you're going to have a lot of coders who aren't particularly good designers or computer scientists. That's what we have. Many of my friends who are actually good  tried to kick it in one of the outsourcing firms, couldn't take the boredom, and left to go to grad school or do something else. It's a self-perpetuating cycle.<p>To summarize: K-12 CS education is not hard, and it's important for producing good computer scientists. You just have to be prepared to accept that not every kid will be interested.",1230303917

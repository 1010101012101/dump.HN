It also looks at a large number of important languages including PCF, Typed/Untyped Lambda Calculus, System F, Gödel&#x27;s T and ALGOL (the last of which is interesting because it uses what we now call the IO Monad).<p>I&#x27;m taking the class (15-312) right now, and as homework we typically implement an interpreter for some language using SML (OCaml would likely work fine for the general use case), and then prove a few things about the language. Our languages rely on our Abstract Binding Tree (ABT) infrastructure that we developed early on in the course.

Both Scala and Java need this because the libraries are distributed as compiled bytecode.<p>> <i>you can&#x27;t use advanced Scala generics from Java</i><p>I cannot parse that. Of course you can use generified Scala classes and methods from Java. They get interpreted as Java wildcards for the co/contra-variance rules. For site-wide variance rules - Java just interprets those as being invariant. Because Scala does not reify generics, classes and methods defined in Scala are usable from Java - get it?<p>> <i>I&#x27;m sure they could have erased the extra stuff on CIL</i><p>Except that it&#x27;s a pain in the neck to do so. For your own standard library, sure it&#x27;s not that big of a deal, but if you want to reuse .NET&#x27;s standard library, good luck erasing those generics.<p>As a consequence, F# has 2 generics type systems in the same language, one for Hindley-Milner that is type-erased and one for interoperability with C# and OOP. And even so, this is limiting F#, as F# does not do higher kinded types or type-classes and the OOP variance rules are quire limited, but because it has to interoperate with .NET - it&#x27;s already too complex and I&#x27;m not seeing it evolve towards something better (yes, I believe Scala&#x27;s type system is much better, warts and all).<p>> <i>Generics in .NET combined with value types are much stronger than Java/Scala generics, there&#x27;s no boxing/casting of value types.</i><p>That&#x27;s not true.

However, I remember how present and obnoxious it was. Promotions for MediaCrush definitely did not appear solely when a user mentioned MediaCrush. It was enough of a problem that an admin on reddit asked you to stop:<p>><p>><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/CDykpWp.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/CDykpWp.png</a><p>&quot;Promotions&quot; did appear only when asked. There were two occasions where we used the bot ourselves to introduce it to the public - you can&#x27;t use a bot you don&#x27;t know about, we had to do it ourselves. From that point out, it was never manually triggered.<p>>> Yes, we upvoted the bot. We didn&#x27;t realize it was a problem, and stopped once it was pointed out.<p>><p>>Many other domains have been blocked from reddit for the same behavior (e.g. <a href=""http://www.dailydot.com/news/reddit-ban-the-atlantic-phsyorg.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailydot.com/news/reddit-ban-the-atlantic-phsyorg...</a>. ), but you consistently portray reddit&#x27;s admins as people who had it in for your site in particular, which is dishonest.<p>Automated vote gaming and bad-faith use is what got those domains banned. I do agree that the admins weren&#x27;t entirely wrong in that, but I maintain that much better communication should have been in place. We weren&#x27;t promoting things in bad faith, no matter how you spin it. The actions of the admins beyond this point are more nails in the coffin, though - it&#x27;s not _just_ that they shadowbanned the bot.<p>>> We don&#x27;t remove any posts where we get negative press.<p>><p>>Yes, you do. They cannot be found from your user page anymore, but I&#x27;ve personally watched you delete your comments in threads where you promote yourself and get bad press.<p>The bot was shadowbanned, and its comments and posts deleted by moderators. Not by us.<p>>You&#x27;ve said things that are explicitly untrue about reddit&#x27;s mods and admins. Mainly that they were big, bad, imgur-partial bullies. Here is the supposedly hostile, anti-user stance that moderators took towards MediaCrush:<p>The majority of Reddit users (not including moderators) supported us. I lost my temper, but I believe I was in the right when criticising the moderators for their choices. The KarmaCourt thing was a mistake, but it was at someone else&#x27;s suggestion and seemed like a good idea at the time. The moderators were clearly in the wrong - their own userbase overwhelmingly supported us.<p>>The bot that you ran promoted your site obnoxiously in many subreddits, and there are plenty of accounts banned via /r/reportthespammers that do exactly the same thing. I don&#x27;t feel that you can argue it was not spam.<p>It _only came when asked for_. This is a _very_ important distinction. Do not spread misinformation by claiming that it spammed Reddit without being asked after - it did not do that.<p>>> there are numerous bots that arguably generate much more spam for competing services<p>><p>>This is a tu-quoque, and doesn&#x27;t justify you in any way.<p>Meaning that the status-quo was set, and other bots were on Reddit doing similar things and not being punished for it. We had role models.<p>>[sillysaurus3:] I&#x27;m getting the feeling that you&#x27;re defending the mods so vigorously because you&#x27;re either a mod or friends with one, but from the perspective of someone who just wants to see good content, they are at times the exact opposite of what Reddit needs. And since they have so much power, the few bad apples make a really big splash.<p>I get a simliar feeling myself.<p>>Dismissing hoverzoom as a non-issue was a very unfortunate decision. It was one of the most damning things you could have done. If I remember correctly, it happened before the recent hoverzoom controversy, and back then everyone on Reddit (me included) was in love with it.<p>This was after the Hoverzoom ad controversy. I don&#x27;t think this was a major contributor to slow adoption.<p>>Dismissing the inability to link directly to the mediacrush&#x27;d gif was also not a good move. If it&#x27;s impossible to link directly to it, then you have to explain what can be done in order to give users something that simulates a direct link.<p>I did, on a few occasions. Keep in mind that these screenshots ghani posted are out of context, don&#x27;t represent the full extent of our communication with moderators, and are intentionally chosen to paint us in a bad light (not that they aren&#x27;t valid criticisms - they&#x27;re just not the whole story).<p>>It&#x27;s disingenuous of you to be deleting your posts on Reddit that reflect poorly on you, and then claiming that you haven&#x27;t ever done so. Here&#x27;s an example: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1k6ig4/the_creat.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1k6ig4/the_creat...</a>.<p>That was deleted by moderators and admins, and the account it was posted from has been shadowbanned. We had nothing to do with that. I will admit to deleting some of my own posts - ones that happen to use MediaCrush as a drop-in Imgur replacement, but not as a promotion - when they don&#x27;t do so well.<p>I think that covers all the points here. The message to take away from this is that MediaCrush participated in some activity that <i>might</i> be considered a bit spammy, but that there was a precedent we followed, and the response from Reddit&#x27;s admins and moderators was unwarranted - especially in the months later.",1396616995

Nice, this thing should just concatenate whatever stringy thing I throw into it. Well, sorta, kinda: <a href=""http://www.mathworks.es/es/help/matlab/ref/strcat.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mathworks.es/es/help/matlab/ref/strcat.html</a><p>> combinedStr = strcat(s1,s2,...,sN) horizontally concatenates strings in arrays. Inputs can be combinations of single strings, strings in scalar cells, character arrays with the same number of rows, and same-sized cell arrays of strings.<p>So you can throw a bunch of different string-like stuff and everything will be concatenated. A bit strange but okay. However, there&#x27;s more:<p>> If any input is a cell array, combinedStr is a cell array of strings. Otherwise, combinedStr is a character array.<p>Ouch. So you can build your program, test it only with non-cell-array arguments, and later on someone trows in an extra thing to concatenate (or uses a cell array to define the output separator).... and that changes the output type of the function!<p>But that&#x27;s not the only side-effect! It truns out that<p>> For character array inputs, strcat removes trailing ASCII white-space characters: space, tab, vertical tab, newline, carriage return, and form-feed. For cell array inputs, strcat does not remove trailing white space.<p>Oh yeah, you also get different &quot;concatenation&quot; rules when these types change. And that&#x27;s even before discussing why on earth would a &quot;strcat&quot; function remove trailing spaces from within the stuff you tell it to concatenate...<p>TL;DR: What is wrong with matlab is that it is designed to write one-liners that probably perform what you want. This is achieved by an endless stream of tweaks in the basic language&#x27;s functions that automagically try to do &quot;what you probably want&quot;.

Most universities require that incoming bachelor&#x27;s degree students to have finished either a matching pre-university secondary education program or pass a test (only for people of 21+ years old) that checks whether a student has the required Dutch/English/math skills. After this, universities are allowed to boot students that fail to pass 50, 80 or 100% of the courses in the first or second year (actual percentages differ per university).<p>On the other hand, master&#x27;s degree programs tend to require a bachelor&#x27;s degree that has sufficient overlap in terms of courses. So to start a Computer Science master&#x27;s degree, you&#x27;d probably need some bachelor&#x27;s degree in engineering, math or physics. If you for instance got a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Psychology, you&#x27;d probably need to attend several courses in order to be allowed to join.",1396616698

Teach the respondent a simple language with made-up words and odd grammar and ask them to ask me questions in it and make up words of their own. Tell the respondent a story and ask them questions about the motivations and relationships between characters and how they change, ask the respondent to make up a conclusion or sequel to the story, and then re-tell the story from the point of view of one of the incidental characters.

Also, by focusing on enterprise needs instead of normal folk, you end up with an offering that is designed for the enterprise, which automatically pushes out the smaller fish.<p>> Patrick&#x27;s agenda is Colin&#x27;s success.<p>Sorry, but this is bullshit. Read the blog post again. I would doubt very much that Colin feels like Tarsnap is a failure of some kind - quite the opposite. Patrick&#x27;s agenda is keeping the idea that what he does is worth &quot;Large Sums of Money&quot;. This might work with the marketing people, but it disappoints me to no end to see this becoming the prevailing view of &quot;Hacker News&quot;.<p>> What should Patrick have done?<p>A much shorter blog post:<p>&quot;Do you know Tarsnap? It&#x27;s this amazing backup solution, created and run by Colin Percival. I wished I could tell everyone to use, but I understand that most people get put off by it&#x27;s lack of marketing polish. This is understandable if you know that Colin is a genius who (like most other geniuses) do not realize how things that seem simple to him might be harder for the common folk.<p>I am not such a genius, so I can not contribute to tarsnap itself. But I can contribute to ancillary things that Colin is too smart to even bother doing. So I put together this website (<a href=""http://link_to_repo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link_to_repo</a>) and also this wiki (<a href=""http://link_to_wiki"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link_to_wiki</a>) where people can discuss things and/or come together to improve the product in ways they think it&#x27;s relevant. This way we can have Colin doing the things he is already happy doing at a such an affordable price, we can get rid of these small annoyances and get to have more arguments to convince Grandma to use Tarsnap. Most importantly, everyone can be sure that Tarsnap will be around for a much longer time.\n&quot;<p>Now, <i>this</i> would be pushing Colin&#x27;s agenda.

But the comment I replied to refers specifically to &quot;one course at one university&quot;, which implies that those are separate dimensions of variation; the same course might exist at different universities. In US usage, that&#x27;s not surprising; lots of colleges have e.g. a &quot;remedial algebra&quot; course.

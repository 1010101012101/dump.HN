In the case of Pinterest, the page isn't scrollable--the image appears to be cut in half by the bottom of the page. In the case of Delicious, the image is cut off by the right side of the page. You can't scroll horizontally here. On A List Apart, the top of the title is cut off, and you can't scroll up to see the rest of it.<p>I think the reason for this is it gives them impression that there's a lot more to the website (even if there really isn't), by not being confined to exist entirely within the page. Also, by cutting off sections of the graphics and text, you are saving yourself a little bit of screen real estate while simultaneously doing something different and eye catching.<p>Just my $.02 though.",1365659980

This has been known for a long time.<p>>In some respects, this is a natural monopoly.<p>No, it's an artificial monopoly.  What we are talking about here is exchanging rides for money.  That is the market - paying someone to drive you on a point-to-point basis.<p>If the market were left to it's own devices, and the only regulations were around traceability, security and the usual laws against blackmail etc, then you'd have a floating market with different prices per time of day and per trip.  This would actually work against congestion by pricing it in.<p>Instead we have a central government committee deciding supply by whatever they use, and fixing prices.  The natural outcome of fixed supply and fixed prices is sub-standard service and a shortage of available product.  <i>Which is exactly what cab users everywhere experience</i>.",1365659876

5530199,comment,5528274,5528274,1,0,Stratoscope,,,"I'm a harmonica player. I don't play a chromatic instrument; I play diatonic instruments in various keys and tunings. The harmonicas I play most are in the Melody Maker tuning [1], which has a major diatonic scale in the ""cross position"" that harp players like to use.<p>When I read a score, the first thing I need to know is which harp to pick up, and whether it will be playable at all on this kind of harmonica.<p>Looking at the Hummingbird notation, how do I figure out which harp to play? I have to study the whole piece to see which sharps and flats it uses, and then translate that pattern back into a likely key for the piece. After I do that, I have to go over the sharps and flats a second time to understand which ones will be normal notes on that harp and which will be bends or overblows or impossible.<p>I guess I could look at the end to see what note it resolves on, but that wouldn't tell me whether it's in a major or minor key. And even if you told me what key the piece is in, I'd still have to study the entire thing to sort out which of the sharps and flats I can ignore and which I have to worry about.<p>Switching to the traditional notation, I can see from the key signature that the piece is either in Eb major or that key's relative minor, and I'd use the Eb Melody Maker for either. Also, I can see at a glance that all the notes in the treble clef follow the Eb major scale except for those E naturals in the middle. Those would be trouble, but the alto part looks easy enough.<p>It may not turn out to be a good harmonica piece anyway, but I immediately know which harp to play. And other than the accidentals, I know the notes will be the ones in my scale, so I can start noodling with it right away.<p>Traditional notation isn't <i>great</i> for a diatonic harmonica player. I don't really think in absolute scale notes at all, since I change harps to change keys. I think in terms of relative scale notes. Letter notes may be anywhere on a harp depending on what key the harp is, but the tonic is always going to be the draw 2, blow 6, and blow 9 regardless of the key.<p>So the ideal notation would be one I could always transpose to match the key of the instrument I'm playing. Maybe Hummingbird would be OK if it was only used on computers and always transposed on the fly. But give me a printed score and I'd be lost. At least with traditional notation I've got a chance.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=melody+maker+harmonica+tuning"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=melody+maker+harmonica+tunin...</a>",1365659559

That and easy branching are the main selling points of Git though over time you discover more and more ways in which Git is subtly superior.<p>If I could start over again on my main repo I'd do it in Git but I already have all my files dating back a long time in an svn repository so the cost of transiting is huge.

5530075,comment,5528274,5528274,1,0,joeld42,,,"Very interesting. I've been trying to learn to read music so I gave it a shot with some of the example songs. I think I'm right in their target audience with where I'm at.<p>I liked the symbols as reminders (I still have to count All-cows-eat-grass or f-a-c-e sometimes), when I was unsure of a note it was quicker to think of the reminder, but still the position was primary, unlike other versions where the notes are labeled with their letter name (which makes it impossible for me to actually pay attention to the notes) it was just a hint.<p>But after I played through the song a few times, it felt a little ""busy"", it was more work to filter out the symbols. It also seemed a lot harder to count the rhythms with this notation (maybe this is just because I have more practice with traditional notation). Finally, I feel like this gives less of a sense of the overall flow of the song -- the ties and the phrasings.<p>As a sort-of-beginner, my reaction to this was that it didn't simplify things much, so I wouldn't want to invest the time in learning this and not being able to read the vast amount of preexisting music out there. On the other hand, I wish I had some of these cues when I was first starting.<p>I'd love to see this not as a replacement to traditional sheet music, but as a standard was to annotate traditional music for beginners. The symbols as hints in particular would have been great. I think this is a great idea but trying to do too much, just a small tweak to any language system is a huge undertaking (and can have huge results). But I'm glad someone is trying. Maybe it's because I'm older now, but learning to read music has felt much harder and more frustrating than learning to program computers.",1365656686
5530074,comment,5529578,5530011,2,0,aspratley,,,"The spam that's being referred to is link spam i.e buying large numbers of links, comment spam etc in order to boost the target domain's search rankings. There's no one tool that will give you an exact answer regarding the domains penalty status. Putting the domain in something like ahrefs.com and looking at the linking domains and the anchor text section should give you a flavour though. If it's using spammy links you'll see things like lots of links in (poor quality) comments coming into the domain, links from unrelated or poor quality sites, lots of links targeting a specific phrase. If you see any links targeting pharmaceuticals or gambling that's usually a bad sign. Obviously you have to use your judgement when looking at these kind of reports - no one tool will be seeing the same dataset that google sees so it's possible it's missed a lot of links also legitimate sites suffer from scraping and apear on spammy sites so you have to look at the link profile as a whole rather than the odd bad link.",1365656686

Also, outside the checkout page or domain search page what they show is an entirely different price from when you move forward to purchase it(even before logging in). On their just one website, any sub-domain - I tried with GoDaddy India pages - there are more than 2 prices at least, for a TLD registration, on different pages.<p>I've raised at least 3-4 tickets in the past and all the answers came ending in something like ""this policy"" ""that policy"" ""certain offer is valid from this or that or sth else"". You ask simple questions using bullet list(I've tried this), they answer(instead of a YES/NO) an entirely different matter and always linking to those irritating policy/pricing page links which I had referred to them in the first place and had asked them questions based upon that.<p>Feels like I asked population of Alaska and the support rep replied Tom Cruise's educational background with Wikipedia links.

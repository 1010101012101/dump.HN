144409,comment,144331,144371,0,0,jdg,,,"Chyrp and Tumblr are two different markets.<p>Tumblr is hosted, Chyrp isn't.  There is an obvious differentiation there and it's two unique sets of users.<p>I agree that competition is healthy.  I also agree that there is more than enough room (in most markets) for more than one player.  However, once one player has a large amount of traction in the market it is difficult to uproot that player unless you are either a) uniquely different (and not just differentiated on features!), or b) you have an actual marketing budget unlike 90% of web2.0 apps out there.<p>If you don't, quit wasting your time.",1206345193

Of course people overcome the odds in both directions. But given equal driving ability, the Ferrari will always win the race, take the prize money, and buy their children a Ferrari.<p>>>People who start out with wealth seldom create wealth.<<<p>What is the basis of that statement? Bill Gates was born to a very wealthy family. Warren Buffet was born to a stockbroker-turned-Congressman, so definitely at least upper middle class. Carlos Slim Helu has been quoted saying ""I came from a wealthy family. I have always had money.""<p>Seems the top three wealth-generators in the world were born wealthy. They attended Harvard, Columbia, and the university consistently ranked the best in Latin America, respectively.<p>The only thing I'm astonished at is that there are people who have so little understanding of how the world works that they think poverty and wealth are not both self-perpetuating.",1206345096

Poverty is the rest state, but there is significant artificial inertia in many parts of the world keeping people from accelerating beyond it.<p>It's hard to understand this when you live in a first world nation.

144394,comment,144303,144367,0,0,tolmasky,,,"I've been avoiding this whole latest essay debacle, but this essay particularly struck me.  It is not a balanced perspective at all in my opinion, and is quite frankly the silliest and saddest rebuttal I've read so far.<p>What this person fundamentally doesn't understand is sacrifice, the key component to starting any company, and having any sort of real success in life.  Does this person honestly think that starting a company entails living a life of poverty forever?  I mean give me a break, you can spend your life eating at fancy restaurants and going to museums when you're 50.  When you start a company, you give up ephemeral comforts like eating at PF Changs for a short period of time for a chance to do something incredible.  The argument that you shouldn't start a start up because you will not have a lot of cash for a fews months or a few years is pretty shallow in my opinion.  In fact, its much sillier to say ""you are lame because you can't afford to eat out for a limited period of time"" than it is to say ""you are lame because you haven't started a company"" (not that pg implied that).<p>I had this guy's life.  Before Y Combinator, I worked at a very high profile company on a very high profile product, and had all the money I needed to buy the latest and greatest tv, or take my girlfriend to a fancy restaurant or go on some fancy vacation.  My cofounder and I ate out EVERY night.  We owned crazy gadgets, we bought expensive toys.<p>Guess what: that's not what happiness is about.  And thank god.  At the end of the day, unless you're curing cancer or something, you will not feel whole, even when working on something incredible.  At least I didn't.<p>Now I'm in Y Combinator.  I get way less sleep.  I am stressed all the time.  There's no such things as weekends.<p>But I'm doing something, and if I succeed, it will be mine.  And if I don't, well guess what, I can still always go back to that old life.<p>And at the end of the day, that's the most important thing: the worst case scenario for me, is the best case scenario for this guy.",1206343015

Really it's a wrist saver in those cases.<p>I <i>occasionally</i> do larger level renames using the tool, but I'm always a bit wary.  It's peripheral stuff that I'm worried about, as with you.  Any more major surgery is usually done by hand.<p>Now, if my tool had better refactorings, I would probably use them.",1206342507

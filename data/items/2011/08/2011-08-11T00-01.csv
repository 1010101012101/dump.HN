2870893,comment,2869215,2870830,7,0,nbpoole,,,"daeken is arguing, based on quite a bit of experience, that PHP applications (even those written with frameworks) tend to have more security vulnerabilities than Rails apps. I happen to agree with him.<p>One very illustrative example: arbitrary code execution. I've lost count of the number of arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities I've found in PHP applications. In contrast, I recall very vividly the last arbitrary code execution vulnerability I found in a Python application: I uploaded a PHP script to the server, which was also running mod_php. ;-)<p>The problem here is simple: most web servers that run PHP are configured with a rule that says ""If a file ends in .php, execute it as PHP."" This is useful for new users: it allows them to run and execute separate PHP scripts very easily. But it's also a potential security vulnerability if an attacker can upload a PHP file to your server.<p>If you're using a framework, you typically have a fixed number of scripts that should be executable and you can configure your web server appropriately. However, that requires a VPS or dedicated server.<p>Edit: If you're interested in an actual language-level difference between PHP and Ruby/Python that affects security, PHP scripts accepted null bytes as part of filesystem paths until recently (PHP 5.3.4, which added protection against it, was released at the end of 2010).",1313024229

2870872,comment,2870511,2870821,4,0,lmkg,,,"Well, the first problem is defining ""line"" and ""circle"" in your new topology, and this in itself tends to complicated not just the answer, but the question. For example, on the surface of a sphere, ""lines"" are a special case of circles, and all circles have two possible center points with two radii, which are distinct iff the circle is not a line. Once you've defined circles and lines, constructable sets looks very different. For example, you can always construct an absolute measure of distance, but the concept of parallel line segments doesn't exist, although you can have circles that are parallel to lines.<p>So can you trisect an angle in this slightly exotic topology? There's a good chance that you can, actually. There's a construction in the plane for trisecting a segment. If that construction is still valid on the sphere, you can take your angle and re-construct the legs with length equal to 1/4 of the sphere's circumference. Now, the line segment connecting the endpoints of these legs is an arc of a circle whose center is your angle. Trisecting this segment, and connecting the trisection back to the angle, will trisect the angle.",1313023825
2870871,comment,2869724,2869724,1,0,_dps,,,"I recommend starting with Witten and Frank's ""Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques"", for two reasons:<p>1) your mathematical background will make it easy for you to spot the areas where they gloss over important theoretical details  (e.g. they don't treat Mercer's theorem deeply, if at all if I recall correctly). This will keep you from making rookie mistakes like picking your own strange kernel functions for SVMs (all of this will make sense to you after reading W+F)<p>2) W+F is accompanied by Weka, which has decent-but-not-great implementations of a wide variety of algorithms in an open-source toolkit with a functional (though not particularly usable) GUI. You can be up-and-running on test problems from the the UCI Machine Learning repository in 20 minutes.<p>Russell and Norvig is a good reference book, but my strong suggestion is to grab W+F, Weka, and some data from UCI's ML repo (<a href=""http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mlearn/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mlearn/</a>). Use Weka to run the standard algorithms from W+F on real data.<p>After that things can get as complicated as you want. I'm personally betting that graphical models (see Koller's ""Probabilistic Graphical Models"") will continue to grow in importance.<p>On the statistical side, I strongly recommend ""Applied Linear Regression"" by Weisberg to get a sense for the kinds of idea statisticians bring to the party (significance, parameter intervals, chained analysis like ANOVA).<p>Hope that helps :-)<p>Edit* spelling errors<p>PS: Almost forgot MacKay's excellent ""Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms"" (free as pdf). It does a great job linking coding, ML, inference, and bayesian probability together. Read at least as far as the section linking K-means clustering to Expectation-Maximization over a Mixture of Gaussians, it's worth it.",1313023792

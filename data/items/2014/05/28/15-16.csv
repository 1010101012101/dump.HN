7810948,comment,7809402,7810413,1,0,derefr,,,"3) Define a Gateway interface (e.g. DataStoreGateway) that presents exactly the API you want to consume; write one implementation of it that speaks to your third-party API (e.g. ODBCDataStoreGateway), and another that doesn&#x27;t do much (e.g. MemoryDataStoreGateway).<p>Note that a trivial gateway-implementation, like MemoryDataStoreGateway, isn&#x27;t a mock! It&#x27;s a fully-functional component that works perfectly well from its consumers&#x27; perspectives. But, unlike the version that consumes a third-party component, it doesn&#x27;t have nearly any failure modes that would confuse your tests. It just does what it does, simply, and lets your tests test what you&#x27;re trying to test.<p>And note that when you stop mocking, and limit yourself to switching out fully-fledged gateway implementations, &quot;dependency injection&quot; stops being this huge pain with Factories and heavily-parameterized initializers. Instead, you can just make your objects discover their collaborators through a service registry. Your unit tests just register the trivial implementations in the service registry on setup().<p>---<p>† Don&#x27;t get a bad taste in your mouth thinking about Spring here.

I want to increase clicks and think to myself, &quot;perhaps if it was a red button instead of a green button, more people would click!&quot; To test this, I would run an A-B test along the lines of:<p>if random(2) == 0 then color=&#x27;red&#x27; else color=&#x27;green&#x27;;<p>In theory, I just push this code and track the number of clicks on the red button versus the green button and then pick the best. But in practice, when I push the code, there might be 5 clicks on green and none on red in the first hour. Maybe green is better? Maybe I didn&#x27;t wait long enough? Okay, let&#x27;s wait longer. A few hours later, there&#x27;s now 10 clicks on red and only 6 clicks on green. Okay, so red is better? Let&#x27;s wait even longer. A week later, there&#x27;s 5000 clicks on red and 4500 clicks on green. That seems like enough data that I can make a conclusion about red vs. green. But is there a better way?<p>This is where A-A-B-B testing can help. Let&#x27;s start by looking at just the A-A part of the test. If I split my audience into two groups (green1 and green2) and show them both green buttons, the results should be identical because both buttons are green. If I check back in an hour and the &quot;green1&quot; and the &quot;green2&quot; groups are off by 20%, then I have a large margin of error and need to wait longer. If I check back in 6 hours and they&#x27;re off by 10%, then I need to wait longer. If I check back in a day and green1 and green2 are only off by 1% then that means we&#x27;ve probably waited long enough and my margin of error is around 1%. I can now add green1+green2 and compare it to red1+red2 groups and see if there&#x27;s a clear winner (e.g. red is 5% better). And this only took a day instead of a week!",1401291991

Most of them are historical and many/most of them unknown or at least poorly understood. Industries are ecosystems and they are culture. Policies play a role, but its a complicated role, interacting with all these things.<p>I&#x27;m objecting to this article on two levels. One, that it is at all possible to pick a result (even if it was defined) like innovation in manufacturing and relate it back to policies which can be then implemented somewhere else to achieve the same result. Policy isn&#x27;t the only thing at play and<p>IE, if the US would understand like Germany understands that &quot;<i>innovation must result in productivity gains that are widespread, rather than concentrated in the high-tech sector of the moment.</i>&quot; then GM would have good software like BMW does.<p>Second, I don&#x27;t think the author even tries. WTF is he even saying. Who is Germany? What exactly does she understand? Does &quot;understand&quot; mean implement a policy? What policy? Are we talking about changing high school curriculum or tax codes? He&#x27;s basically isn&#x27;t saying anything while trying to give his audience the impression that some very obvious mistakes are being made needlessly.<p>The conclusions are populist and political, nearly implying a belligerent conspiracy.<p>&quot;<i>Germany’s innovations create and sustain good jobs across the spectrum of workers’ educational attainment; American innovation, at best, creates jobs at Amazon’s fulfillment centers and in Apple stores.</i>&quot;<p>And it&#x27;s mostly untrue, to the extent that weasely implications and unspecific statements can be true or untrue. The bones of his non-argument seems to be that German innovation creates good middle class manufacturing jobs while US innovation eliminates them. That&#x27;s not true.<p>Amazon & Apple do not employ only low wage staff. They have nothing to do with displacing auto workers. They employ mostly people in &quot;middle class&quot; jobs. The German manufacturing sector isn&#x27;t increasing employment in good old 1950s style manufacturing jobs either.

7810843,comment,7808583,7810688,3,0,IgorPartola,,,"While I agree with you on the whole, one minor point about UDP/datagrams: they are not reliable even on localhost under some circumstances. The point of datagrams is that they are allowed to be lost without a trace if the consumer (syslog) is not consuming fast enough. For example, if process A starts spewing 10,000 log records (UPD or datagram UNIX socket packets) a second at syslog, and syslog can only handle 5,000, then the other 5,000 records will be lost. Any other process will also get its records lost as they will not be guaranteed to be processed. The rate of loss will be controlled by how large a datagram buffer the consumer&#x27;s kernel has. Moreover, the processing will not be uniform: the buffer is LIFO, so older records will be processed while newer ones will be lost.<p>On the other hand if you use stream sockets, the producer will either block or be told that the consumer is not ready to read any more data (beauty of TCP). In either case, TCP produces enough overhead compared to UDP to slow down the actual useful part of your application, which is often not desirable.<p>Neither one of these is a good solution as either your consumer or your producer needs to keep their own very large buffers to accommodate spikes in traffic. Ideally, you do this anyways to ensure that you hold onto all the packets you received.<p>Having said that, I don&#x27;t know exactly what rsyslog does so I cannot say if this would actually be a problem for it.",1401291874

I had PRK about 8 or 10 years ago and am very happy with the results.  PRK is the older technology where they just laser the surface of your eye rather than cutting a flap and peeling it up before lasering.  The risk are the same but different. That is to say, roughly the same (low, <2% if memory serves) chance of making your vision worse but with PRK it&#x27;ll be caused by infection/poor healing of the epithelium, while with LASIK it&#x27;ll be caused by complications due to cutting the flap.  LASIK is(or at least was) more dependent on doctor skill/mistakes, while PRK is pretty much all computerized and juste depends on your cleanliness and immune system.  The other big difference is healing.  With LASIK it&#x27;s zap, done, perfect vision, drive home and enjoy...just don&#x27;t get poked in the eye for a couple months. With PRK it&#x27;s zap, hay I can kinda see, have someone drive you home while the pain kilers wear off, oh god it hurts, I can&#x27;t see anything, lay on the couch crying for 3 days, and then watch your vision get slowly better over the next month or so till eventually it&#x27;s perfect.  That&#x27;s why LASIK is considered an improvement, because burning the skin off your eyes isn&#x27;t a lot of fun(think onions under your eyes), and it takes about 3 days to grow back and another month to heal to the healthy smooth state required for 20/20 vision.  Still it was worth it.  Personally I chose PRK because I was doing MMA at the time so LASIK would have required taking 3 to 6 months off training to make sure I didn&#x27;t damage the flap, whereas PRK on a friday let me continue training next week. Think I had to take monday off work &#x27;cause I was still in pain, but by Tuesday I was OK.  Driving was a bit hairy for a month or so.  OK during the day but at night when your pupils dilate I&#x27;d have quadruple vision and major star-bursting from headlights, but not so bad I couldn&#x27;t drive, but kinda freaky.  After about 4 or 5 weeks that all faded and I had 20/15 vision.  Totally worth it.",1401291552

The last time I used mocks: we&#x27;re interfacing with motor control hardware.<p>In code we have interfaces for axis configuration, axis movement and so on. All implemented for different controllers. On top of that there&#x27;s a layer defining specific movements. Say you want to go from point a to b while avoiding c, there&#x27;s a piece of code that calculates a route (so it needs axes configurations for max velocity/range/...) and another piece that applies this route to a set of axes (so it needs axes to drive).<p>Apart from dragging around a bunch of motors everywhere I code, how am I supposed to properly test those two pieces without any mocks? Telling me the design is all wrong to start with is fine, but then you also have to come up with a better one of course :). Telling me that route calculation shouldn&#x27;t depend directly on axis configuration but should use it&#x27;s own configuration type and I should then add a conversion between the two is also no solution as it a) introduces an extra layer and b) still requires a mock to test the conversion, d&#x27;uh :)",1401291299

Nothing.)<p>So I am actually making the opposite point, that it shouldn&#x27;t be the same language.  I don&#x27;t think the new form is new enough, I wouldn&#x27;t call it the iPad of my analogy.  In particular, I am also saying that &quot;the iPad shouldn&#x27;t run Apple ][ code&quot;.  (at all.)  Nearly all Apple ][ code shoudl be a syntax failure on the iPad.  Including even $_.  Every syntactical element should behave differently, minimally.  Much simpler syntax with very little sugar.  Much more verbose.<p>Basically a totally different language should be whitebranded with the brand currently worn by this language.  People who used that language shouldn&#x27;t recognize this language.  People who use this language, shouldn&#x27;t be able to understand that language.  They shouldn&#x27;t have anything in common.<p>The two things should have literally as much in common as the Apple ][ does with an iPad, which is nigh-unto nothing.<p>You say, &quot;it&#x27;s still the same language if you want it to be&quot;, but that is a problem.  It is like saying you can still pull a jumbo jet with a horse if you want to.  No, you shouldn&#x27;t be able to pull a jumbo jet with a horse at all, a jet just shouldn&#x27;t support acting as a cab.  It should fail to move forward.  The horse should give up.  The horse in this case is Ascii.  It should never even be hitched to it.<p>Nothing should remain of Perl but the brand, and that they&#x27;re both turing-complete, just as the intersection between an iPad and an Apple ][ is the null set (plus the fact that they&#x27;re both physical objects, and a few similar superficial similarities that would apply to every computing device / programming language.)",1401290364

The only difference is you&#x27;re not using a mocking &quot;framework&quot;.  Seems to me all you&#x27;re doing is inheriting a lot of external dependencies that have little or nothing to do with your test.

If you want to unit-test your code that depends on those 3rd party libraries, then your choices are to:<p>1) Use the real thing. This can be slower and a lot less reliable.<p>2) Capture some typical output of the 3rd party api, and make a mock that emits it.<p>Which technique is useful? Both are. But the second one gives you fast-running fine-grained repeatable unit tests so therefore is your first line of testing.<p>So you discover in an integration test (#1) that the live api has a behaviour that the mock doesn&#x27;t, maybe an occasional malformed response due to an error at the other end. Great, capture it and add it to the mock. Now you can reproduce it at will and write fast tests on how you handle it.",1401290335

7810369,comment,7809791,7810158,6,0,pcwalton,,,"> It seems like this GC advocacy is based upon a checkmark more than a reality.<p>There are many domains in which GC is a deal-breaker, simply because you lose the fine-grained control over memory that you require: for example, games, embedded systems, kernels, and browser engines. (Go does not give you control over memory in the same way that C++, for example, does; consider map elements or closure upvars.)<p>> The compiler intelligently turns a significant number of allocations into stack allocations (the same allocations would be heap allocations in .NET and Java, by comparison).<p>No, .NET and Java do escape analysis as well.<p>The difference is that the JVM and CLR have generational garbage collectors with a copying nursery, so heap allocations are essentially as cheap as stack allocations: just a pointer bump. In the JVM (in contrast to Go) escape analysis is mainly used for eliding locks; allocation is so cheap that promoting heap allocations to stack allocations barely matters.",1401289950

Mistakes happen all the time.<p>The thing that concerned us most is that as a user of Facebook we had the impression that all efforts of reporting the issue where unheard. There was literally no feedback what so ever. I totally get that Facebook can&#x27;t respond individually to error reports, it&#x27;s just got too many users for that. None the less we felt really helpless in that situation.<p>I would never have imagined anyone of Facebook would ever answer this HN post. So again: Kudos for this statement and thanks for resolving this issue.<p>Niko.",1401289304

I literally spent the better part of yesterday researching best practices for queueing jobs from ASP.NET (WEB API) hosted on Windows Server, not Azure. I was considering NetMSMQ based WCF, Windows Service Bus 1.1, NServiceBus, MassTransit, ServiceStack, Windows Azure Pack, Redis or RabbitMQ hosting Worker Processes as Windows Services.<p>I had settled on the later as I wanted to avoid the complicated configuration of WCF, if possible, and just wanted a simple, reliable, and scalable way, to queue messages and process them. Ideally, I wanted a way to host/launch the worker processes from the web app to avoid complicating the development environment by having to install and run separate processes (Windows Service).<p>I will definitely be looking at this project today and putting it through a PoC.<p>Update: Forgot to mention ServiceStack in list of frameworks considered.",1401289280

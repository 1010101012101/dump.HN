8535034,comment,8534717,8534952,0,0,schoen,,,"I guess another way of phrasing the original article&#x27;s claim is that although communities do form, they have no straightforward way to exclude strangers, interlopers, and even griefers: and except for incessant use of hashtags (which could eat up valuable space), there&#x27;s no simple way for a person who is part of multiple communities to direct comments to only one community.<p>That&#x27;s a recipe for <i>both</i> serendipity and uncomfortable moments (or worse) if someone has strong opinions on, say, computer science, religion, and animal rights.  People who chose to follow them over one thing will constantly see their opinions on other things.  That might be great under some circumstances because it will promote more interesting and broader discussions or lead people to learn about ideas that they wouldn&#x27;t have naturally come across in their own filter bubble.  But it might produce some serious disruption in the conversation too, especially if that person&#x27;s views are offensive or upsetting to some readers.<p>I know a Twitter user writes a lot about computer science and a lot about sex and sexuality.  I find both sets of posts frequently insightful, but the latter would be off-topic in a forum devoted only to computer science, and they do sometimes produce offense.<p>It seems like the best case for avoiding really bad forms of conflict is when a group of people tweet almost exclusively on a single topic that outsiders don&#x27;t find upsetting or offensive (or simply don&#x27;t know about).  But a lot of people do want to have at least some discussions that others will inevitably be offended by, and the broadcast medium can be a challenge for that if you didn&#x27;t want to get into it with the strangers (or for that matter have some of them insult you, threaten you, or even dox you).",1414695554

8534989,comment,8533843,8533843,0,0,stiff,,,"I am at a vacation and bored, so I decided to try to actually understand this. I do not know much APL/K/J, but for a start, here is a version with more traditional line breaking:<p><a href=""https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f72e5c4a432492abce59"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f72e5c4a432492abce59</a><p>Some basic observations:<p>- He uses all the obscure C features, like the ability to not declare the type of an argument or return value and let the compiler fill in, and also the old school style of declaring functions:<p><pre><code>  foo(x,y) int x, y { return 0; }\n</code></pre>\nInstead of:<p><pre><code>  int foo(int x, int y) { return 0; }\n</code></pre>\nSince the compiler will infer the int, and since he uses R for return this example eventually becomes:<p><pre><code>  foo(x,y){R(0);}\n</code></pre>\n- Variables, or really registers, are only accessible as letters from a to z, and the &quot;st&quot; array stores the values of all registers. Numbers entered in the REPL have to be between 0 and 9, and hence he avoids the dirty work of making a proper lexer. It&#x27;s also super easy to trigger a segfault since any error handling is non-existent.<p>- DO(n,x) is a C macro that evaluates the given expression &quot;x&quot; for all numbers between 0 and &quot;n&quot;<p>- V1 is a C macro that defines unary operators for the interpreted language, and V2 defines binary operators. In V1 definitions the operand is called &quot;w&quot;, in V2 the operands are called &quot;a&quot; and &quot;w&quot;.<p>- For example &quot;,&quot;, which calls the cat function, is a binary operator that creates vectors:<p><pre><code>  1,2,3,4\n  4 \n  1 2 3 4\n</code></pre>\n- The vt, vd and vm arrays map ascii symbols to the functions defined with V1 and V2. { is the second symbol in vt, so when used as a unary operator it calls &quot;size&quot; (second non-null element of vm):<p><pre><code>  {5,6,7,8\n  \n  4\n</code></pre>\nand when used as a binary operator it calls &quot;from&quot; (second non-null element of vd).<p>- wd is a parser that goes from the original input string to a weird intermediate form that is an array of longs. Each input character gets mapped one-to-one to an item in this intermediate form.<p><pre><code>  If the input character was a number between 0 and 9:\n    Value type instance gets allocated\n    Intermediate form for this input character consists of the address of the allocated instance\n\n  If the character is a letter between &quot;a&quot; and &quot;z&quot;:\n    Intermediate form consists simply of this character\n\n  If the character represents an operator\n    Intermediate form consists of the index of the operator in the vt array\n</code></pre>\nIn other words, the intermediate form is an array where some elements are ascii characters, others are memory addresses and yet other indices into some array. This part is really something.<p>- The ex function executes the intermediate form. Since everything in the input is fixed length, and there is no syntax checking, it just indexes into the intermediate form assuming everything is well formed, while the parser did not check that so it&#x27;s not really guaranteed - again a source of easy segfaults. The execution goes from left to right and consists of looking at the first position in the intermediate form and then making recurrent calls if necessary (let X be the current item in the intermediate form):<p><pre><code>  If X is a character\n    Lookahead one item\n    If it is a &#x27;=&#x27; char\n      Assign the result of executing everything after the &#x27;=&#x27; to the register indicated by X\n    Assign to X the value of the register named by X\n  If X is not a character and is a small integer\n    We are applying a binary operator\n    X is the index into the &quot;vm&quot; array\n    Fetch the function from &quot;vm&quot;, apply it to the result of executing the rest of the intermediate form\n  Otherwise:\n    If there is any more input remaining other than the current item, we are applying a binary operator\n    Lookup the function in &quot;vt&quot;, apply it to the result of executing the intermediate form to the left and to the right of the operator\n</code></pre>\n- I have the biggest problem with understanding that &quot;a&quot; struct, that represents all values in the interpreted language, which are arrays. ga is clearly the basic allocation function for it, &quot;plus&quot; obviously adds two arrays, so it&#x27;s clear the &quot;p&quot; field holds the actual contents, but that&#x27;s where things get very shady.",1414695251

A lot of books.&quot; An invaluable piece of advice from a distinguished philosophy professor of mine.<p>As a freshmen I&#x27;d somehow found my way into his ancient philosophy course–a junior/senior elective typically reserved for PHL majors. While I was able to pass the course, I was always embarrassed by my paper submissions because they&#x27;d be returned to me dripping in red ink from his observations. This was a man that had his own translations of Plato&#x27;s works published in textbooks, and he cared enough to take the time to point out my juvenile grammatical errors on 20 page papers! At the close of the course I wanted to &quot;make amends&quot; for my shortcomings by asking him how I could improve my writing ability. I anticipated he&#x27;d recommend some tome on grammar [that I&#x27;d never end up reading] but instead he simply said &quot;Read books. A lot of books&quot; and he left it at that.<p>I&#x27;ve no idea of the count of books I&#x27;ve read since taking his advice to heart, but it&#x27;s made an enormous difference in the way I structure prose, the vocabulary I use, the tone & voice of my writing, and I could go on... I feel that if you read the works of authors you like on topics that you enjoy, you&#x27;ll absorb much of what makes their works great. You&#x27;ll find yourself improving without consciously trying to improve your mechanics–but you need to enjoy what you read for it to work!<p>And as a check on your own development? Throw in works like &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; or &quot;Fight Club&quot; from time to time. These works have intentional errors and nonsense thrown in by their authors to mess with their readers.

I analysed the facts heavily and believe that the God of the bible is more plausible than any other explanation of our existence.<p>I don&#x27;t agree with this view at all, and I would like to see an example of one such fact that is best &quot;explained&quot; by positing a supernatural agent. Invoking supernatural to explain something is not really explaining anything, and even worse, to rule out any possibility of it ever being explained. Because anything supernatural must by definition be beyond the reach of a natural explanation. It must be beyond the reach of science and the well-established, tried and tested scientific method that has been responsible for the huge advances in knowledge we have enjoyed over the last 400 years or so. To say that something happened supernaturally is not just to say we don’t understand it, but to say we will never understand it so don’t even try.<p>Science takes exactly the opposite approach. Science thrives on its inability, so far, to explain everything, and uses that as the spur to go on asking questions, creating possible models and testing them, so that we make our way, inch by inch, closer to the truth. If something were to happen that went against our current understanding of reality, we would see that as a challenge to our present model, requiring us to abandon or at least change it. It is through such adjustments and subsequent testing that we approach closer and closer to what is true.<p>What would you think of a detective who, baffled by a murder, was too lazy even to try to work at the problem and instead wrote the mystery off as supernatural? The whole history of science shows us that things once thought to be the result of the supernatural, caused by gods (both happy and angry), demons, witches, spirits, curses and spells, actually do have natural explanations: explanations that we can understand and test and have confidence in. There is absolutely no reason to believe that those things for which science does not yet have natural explanations will turn out to be of supernatural origin, any more than volcanoes or earthquakes or diseases turn out to be caused by angry deities, as people once believed they were.<p>Put another way, show me one fact for which scientific explanation no matter how inadequate was once the best explanation but for which relgious/theological explanation is now better one.",1414694860

I presume that the carbon mass of the plants has mostly been extracted from atmospheric CO2.  Empirically, as time goes on the pile gets larger.

How is a feed forward circuit carrying information (to be integated) not a physical realization? It&#x27;s not clear why neurons carrying potentials and mixing them count but not an FPGA (no longer an ALU simulation) doing cryptographic operations for a bitcoin mining rig. Furthermore as an FPGA more directly implements the information integration system than an ALU fetch-execute cycle, is it &#x27;more conscious&#x27;? For me that sounds absurd.<p>Presume the Game of Life _did_ have a direct physical implementation, let&#x27;s say neurons fire according to GOL rules.

N-body problems exhibit highly integrated behavior manifest in the so-called butterfly effect. Why do the air molecules in a balloon not count as conscious? This physical example escapes the &quot;America&quot; criticism - every molecule applies a force on every other and due to n-body mechanics the system is highly integrated.<p>My worry, which I think is mostly corroborated, is that the definite clarity of the IIT definition will serve to obscure the fact that underlying definition has no real definite clarity or derivation.<p>Ultimately the IIT formula was imagined to capture some heuristic notions - but it was not derived.

I built a custom keyboard for iOS8 that imitates the looks and behavior of the native QWERTY keyboard. The goal from the start was to be entirely programmatic: all the art and layout are generated in code, so it&#x27;s much easier to extend than something built using XIBs and PNGs. It&#x27;s rough around the edges (due to deadlines), the code is messy, and I don&#x27;t intend to devote too much of my side project time to maintaining it as a framework, but I figured it might make a good starting point for anyone doing something similar.<p>The project page: https://github.com/archagon/tasty-imitation-keyboard<p>Here&#x27;s how it got started. I speak Russian, but I&#x27;m terrible at typing on anything but the standard QWERTY keyboard, and so I was interested in getting transliteration (along the lines of http://www.translit.ru) working on iOS8. On a Mac, this was as easy as building an &quot;input method&quot;, which sits between your input and output and converts things as you type. But on iOS8, if you&#x27;re building a custom keyboard, you really have to start from scratch. My goal was to make a keyboard that looks pretty much the same as the system keyboard but allows you to change the way it behaves, thus fulfilling the same goal as an input method in a roundabout way.<p>The behavior isn&#x27;t perfect. The graphics deviate, there are a few rough performance edges, and there are some features missing (including iPad support). But it works!

Namely, lots of exposure.<p>Access to videos, even non-boring audio, not to mention to native speakers, was much more difficult and limited for the average language learner in the U.S. at that time.<p>For one foreign language, limited access to pop music that I rather enjoyed helped significantly.  Listening to it repeatedly helped me absorb the sound of the language.<p>For another, a very early and successful foray into video taped lessons that had a running, dramatic and humorous story as a major component proved quite effective.  SO much better than those dreadful, &quot;repeter&quot; audio cassettes.  In addition to the language itself, the videos provided, without explicitly describing it all, a lot of cultural context.<p>Speaking and writing did, of course, also help.  All the passive, listening and observing understanding does not fully form those neural pathways.<p>But when it did come to speaking and writing, I started off with a much better idea of how the language actually sounds, what the day-to-day idioms and colloquialisms are.  I wasn&#x27;t simply trying to translate my thoughts, word for word, into the other language -- something that often ends up sounding rather off and that, inadvertently, takes on different meanings from those intended.<p>When I arrived in one foreign city, acquaintances who eventually became friends told me that I sounded &quot;like and old book&quot;.  Because in my literature classes, that had been my primary exposure.  With time in the &quot;real&quot;, contemporary world of that language, this changed.<p>So, don&#x27;t overdue or rely on &quot;memorization&quot;.  That conscious level activity has its limits.  Take advantage of today&#x27;s media-rich world to gain as much exposure as you can.  And beware of the contexts of that media; just as in your native tongue, people speak differently in different contexts.  Fortunately, e.g. in video, it&#x27;s often easy to get some idea of what context is being portrayed.<p>Oh, and do read a lot, too.  I have some exposure to a few languages orally, where I&#x27;d have a hard time writing down a few words much less complete sentences.<p>Nonetheless, you need the other exposure I describe to have a fuller sense of the language and to &quot;sound right&quot;.",1414694257

But in chess, slight variations in every board position will have huge impact on the outcome of the came. Raw calculation is a necessary component of strong play and intuition is much less useful.",1414694189

Especially when these opinions are tied to politicized propaganda from the opposition and not remotely tied to a legitimate interest into monetary policy or late 19th century industry.<p>I don&#x27;t think young geeky introverts need to be told to be more rebellious, if anything they should learn to conform more, learn better social skills, understand the power of teams and collaboration, etc. I really wish someone told me this when I was younger.

JS optimization is already pretty unpredictable, since the language is dynamic (both in terms of typing and e.g. object memory layout, with the exception of typed arrays); JS primitives are farther from the metal; the optimizations that JS engines perform are implementation-specific, rarely well-documented and always in flux; and it&#x27;s difficult to see what machine code actually runs for a given JS function. SIMD instructions may make some sense for JS as a compiler target, but they seem to make less sense for JS as a language that doesn&#x27;t have integers or 32-bit floating point numbers. On top of that, most users of vectorization are targeting a specific architecture or even CPU, whereas JS code is meant to run anywhere. It doesn&#x27;t seem like there&#x27;s been much work to alter the language or tools to make it easier for programmers to reason about other sources of unpredictability, so why so much emphasis on SIMD?<p>I&#x27;ll admit some ignorance here, but it also seems to me that a JIT may also have some advantages WRT autovectorization as compared with a static compiler, since you can collect runtime information about aliasing and loop trip count before choosing to vectorize. But if the point is to make performance easier to reason about, why not start with the rest of the language before worrying about vectorization?",1414693700

8534769,comment,8532261,8534233,0,0,matthewmcg,,,"I think the proponents of same sex marriage would respond that what they are trying to do is not prevent the government from regulating behavior (which, as you say, is the essence of lawmaking), but prevent the government from treating persons in same sex relationships differently from persons in opposite sex relationships. The key question is whether the government can discriminate based on sexual orientation.<p>In the U.S., the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment prohibits a state from denying any person &quot;the equal protection of the laws.&quot; This would appear to forbid discrimination based on any characteristic at all. Of course, governments make distinctions based on people&#x27;s characteristics all the time. These range from the mundane (persons with poor vision can be required to wear corrective lenses while driving) to the highly consequential (American citizens of Japanese ancestry can be interred during a war against Japan).<p>The history of the Equal Protection Clause, then, is a long and messy process of sorting out what kinds of discrimination are permissible and what aren&#x27;t. And there has been a lot of movement, especially during last few decades. Consider that during the lifetime of George Takei, the EPC was interpreted to permit the internment of his family (Korematsu v. United States, 1944) <i>and</i> giving him the right (in California) to marry his husband of the same sex (Hollingsworth v. Perry, 2013).<p>The current standard is that that you can discriminate on a basis other than certain &quot;suspect&quot; classifications <i>if</i> the discrimination is reasonably related to a legitimate government interest.<p>In the recent Windsor case, the Supreme Court concluded that the federal Defense of Marriage Act failed to meet even that minimal standard. Many lower courts have invalidated state same sex marriage bans on the same basis.<p>You can argue that it is the place of the legislature to decide what classifications it can use in lawmaking, but that raises two problems. First, the clause is part of the Constitution and it must impose <i>some</i> limit on the power of state legislatures, and there needs to be a process for interpreting what that limit is. Second, history has shown that the political process doesn&#x27;t always protect unpopular minorities (though there are also good arguments that courts are not that much better).",1414693342

I don&#x27;t know of any page where you get side by side clojurescript -> generated js code comparison. It&#x27;s similar to js-of-ocaml and many other LanguageX-in-JS projects.<p>Jisp on the other hand looks like it&#x27;s a straightforward transpiler, with more or less one to one mapping between Jisp and JS constructs, without the need for providing large runtime. It looks like CoffeeScript with a sexps-based syntax. It reminds me of Hy language and Lisp Flavored Erlang, which I feel are similar projects (for Python and Erlang respectively).<p>There are at least 3 other Lisp dialects with similar philosophy on JS (excluding ClojureScript) out there, but when I last looked on them I wasn&#x27;t convinced by any one and I stayed with LiveScript for work and I started exploring ClojureScript.

8534649,comment,8532261,8534342,0,0,srean,,,"While what you say is true, for the benefit of the readers not very familiar with India I would like to add a few things for context. If from the name of the politician linked by the parent comment you come to the conclusion that homosexuality is frowned upon only by muslim politicians, you couldnt be more wrong. India is an incredibly high variance country. In some metros you would find gay pubs and bars, open kissing on the streets among gay partners with no one bothered a bit (if your state is one of the right wing ones then YMMV). Then again there are states (correlated with Hindi and Haryanvi speaking regions) where parents and family would kill their children, subject them to community sanctioned gang-rape because they married or proposed to marry someone considered different. Note that these &#x27;punishments&#x27; and &#x27;corrective measures&#x27; have popular sanction within the community and the perpetrators often voluntarily surrender after the incident.<p>It is as if India remains frozen in different centuries in different regions, ranging from the modern to the grotesquely medieval. If you ask your local hindu rightwinger, its of course all the muslim invaders fault that they have to keep continuing these practices. Hinduism of course has done nobody no wrong, just been stabbed in the back (this should sound familiar).<p>Anal sex (in fact anything apart from missionary position) continues to be a crime according to law but it is not something that gets enforced unless the enforcer has some specific axe to grind. That law certainly does not represent practice. Indian legal system is another weird thing. Most of the laws were set down by the colonizers, not to set a framework for justice but to facilitate control. We as Indians have done little to dispose that baggage, rather it has been actively embraced by those in power to exercise similar control, often with a lot of popular support.<p>Quite interestingly, a marginalized community would see nothing wrong in cruel treatment of another marginalized community, often happily taking the lead in the harassment. A low caste person in a caste&#x27;ist state would see nothing wrong in hounding someone just because he is muslim, or belongs to a caste that is even lower.

If I were gay I would distance myself from that crap.<p>In your world, I&#x27;m a bigot because I HATE that overly-camp, sledge-hammer decorative approach with men in g-strings running around in heels and pink fluffy decorations everywhere and don&#x27;t forget the awful gay dance music. That&#x27;s what it is to be gay? I don&#x27;t think so. The mardi gras (at least the one where I live) needs to die. But I can&#x27;t say that because I&#x27;ll be &quot;anti-gay&quot;. I&#x27;m not anti-gay, I just hate the annual celebration of the &quot;gay community&quot; by erecting giant penises on floats and broadcasting it all on live TV.<p>Do you see the problem? Just because you see gay marriage as something only a bigot would oppose, doesn&#x27;t mean you have the right to drag everyone else into that binary mindset.",1414692091

Our benefits are good compared to my past employers, and I took a few weeks of paid vacation time so I could stay home with my wife and help after her c-section. I&#x27;m glad to hear that there is leave available for graduate students as well. Are the 60 days of paid leave for sick time or paternity leave? I had not heard that anything changed recently with the rules around time off.<p>Best of luck to you and your wife!",1414692076

Deciding to act upon something can only happen if there&#x27;s sufficient curiosity. Curiosity comes from questions. Why? What if? How might one...?<p>Questions are so fundamental to everything from creativity to innovation, management, sales, relationships...I just had my eyes opened by <i>A More Beautiful Question</i> by Warren Berger.",1414692046

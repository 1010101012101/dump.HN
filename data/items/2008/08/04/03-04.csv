His interview was one of my favorites.<p>He's got an interesting approach to entrepreneurship -- rather than coming up with novel ideas, Fabrice takes ideas that work in one location and replicates them somewhere else.  First he built (and sold) the eBay of Latin America + Europe, then he brought ringtones to America from Asia (!).  After selling his ringtone company for $80M, he founded OLX, to bring craigslist to other countries.<p>Check out his interview; you'll learn a lot.",1217822330

I had no idea Yahoo had a blog like this.<p>But just in general, I think people don't give Yahoo enough credit for what it's trying to accomplish. They have a lot of cool things in the pipeline and are big proponents of open source (ie. hadoop). This is just another example of how it's trying to reach out to startups and developers.

I think that there are very smart reasons for why Steve Jobs did what he did.<p>When the iPhone version 1.0 was released AT&T probably was still in the ""I'm a big carrier, hear me roar"" kind of mentality. But as the iPhone blew up, AT&T released that it needed to adjust quick, so perhaps that's how Apple was able to push through their SDK.<p>I think in general Apple just has to be more open with it's fan cult.",1217821684

Wasting money on a legal entity. If you're not making money, you cannot be sued. Wait until you make money or have someone willing to give you money before you waste money on protecting yourself.<p>2. Bad business partners. Judge your partners not by how much you like them but if they'll complement your skillz, add value to the team, and are dedicated to the project.<p>3. Not saying no. It's a personal problem, I'm a really nice guy, it's hard for me to say no sometimes, but it's necessary. It's not personal, it's business.",1217821397

Sure, you could build a localized classified ads service that looks ""more modern"" -- meaning it uses gradients for no good reason other than everyone else is using them -- but that's no Craiglist.<p>Now, if you have a site that somehow gets past some major problem or irritation that Craiglist users face, then maybe you've got a chance.

265951,comment,265897,265897,0,0,charlesju,,,"I agree that Perl's CPAN is probably the most awesome thing invented since slice bread. If you want to hack together something really quick, like PHP, Perl is awesome.<p>But the beauty of Ruby on Rails is abstraction. It takes a while getting used to the code and the framework, but that time invested is paid off in productivity. Ruby on Rails is really on a whole new playing field. Complete object orientation, a fully developed framework to deploy and TEST with a single command in the terminal, MVC, it is just ... heavnly. To be honest, any language can build the Rails framework. Ruby isn't necessarily too unique in that sense. What does make it unique is having an evangelical preacher for its framework, David ""oh so sexy"" Hansson, and a kind and awesome community.<p>You should give it another shot, if you're a web developer, it'll make your life a million times easier.",1217821042

Since then I've worked on all different types of platforms and at last count had used 13 different programming languages in that period.<p>I recently went through a re-eval of what tech I wanted to be working with and ended up with Python. I tried to return to Perl but couldn't do it. Mainly it is because I'm back working on web projects and Perl's web frameworks aren't so nice. People worship CPAN, but I've never found it any more useful than SF or Googe Code. That is to say, useful yes, but amazing or worthy of awe?

What book were you using?<p>The fact that you called it ""Ruby on Rails"" does not inspire confidence. Rails is a complex Ruby framework, and a lot of Rails code actually consists of calls to a Ruby-based DSL for the Web. It's hard to appreciate the kinship between Ruby and Perl, or Ruby's usefulness for Perl-like tasks, when you approach the language from that high-level angle. Try <i>Programming Ruby</i> or <i>The Ruby Way</i> -- or, heck, try _Why's <i>Poignant Guide to Ruby with Cartoon Foxes</i>, which is how I learned, though its unique style is not for everyone.<p>Ruby was built by a Perl fan; it was <i>named</i> in honor of Perl, and I find that most of the glue-code tasks that were easy in Perl are even easier in Ruby.<p>I will certainly <i>use</i> Perl in the future -- one good thing about the language's awesome documentation culture, and its excellent automated build tools, is that they let you use Perl code without having to read any of it.

Most people have one operation in their lifetime, sometimes more than one, usually those are to treat conditions that would otherwise cause a substantial decrease in lifespan.<p>Appendicitis, gal bladder removal, heart stents and so on. I'm Dutch by the way, not American.<p>> The options open to someone who only faces accidental mortality are beyond our imagining. Imagine what a Jefferson or an Edison would achieve in 500 years. Imagine if Einstein had a 100 more to work on unified theories. Besides, with all that time to master knowledge I'm sure some bright spark could come up with a way to heal stab victims.<p>That would have been great, but it presumes that you can keep the brain functioning for that long as well, and in 'top shape'. As it is most 'brilliant' work has been done by scientists when they are relatively young, late bloomers are the exception.<p>And Einstein was pretty much stuck in a rut at the end of his days, no disrespect there, it's fairly well documented, he was such a formidable force to oppose that he managed to hold back black hole research until 10 years after his death.<p>> I'm not sure this is proven. Even if that's the case, I have a lot of useless knowledge about the maps of Quake 3 levels or the characters in obscure TV shows that could be jettisoned without great loss.<p>But how to tell those apart from the ones that make up your identity ? A 'garbage collection' algorithm would have to be pretty precise! Do you want to compress your memory Yes / No is probably best answered with 'No'.<p>> We have preliminary technology that can read thoughts and imperatives.<p>True<p>> Doesn't seem that far-fetched to map the brain given time.<p>Also true, but <i>how much</i> time. There are plenty of people that seem to believe this will happen in our lifetime and I think that's not even close.<p>> Besides, you seem to rule out human/brain interfaces - why can't I have a constant link between brain and computer and in a worse case death scenario I simply lose the experiences since my last link time.<p>Interesting possibility, but it combines <i>all</i> of the problems associated with AI, recording and programming through a 'link' the structure of some new brain. And where does that come from ? (that new brain, not the link)<p>> However, you do raise some interesting societal issues. Nevertheless, ""how will people deal with it"" hardly seems a valid reason to prevent research that could let people live healthily to 500+.<p>No, I'm all for the research. I just have an issue with the belief that this is just around the corner.<p>> The alternative is we are saying people deserve to die because they are old.<p>For the time being, that's the way it will be. Research is to be encouraged, taking in to account the social consequences in parallel. But this - if it ever comes to pass - will upset our society like nothing else ever has. But it won't be our worry. I think :)",1269518031

As far as I see, it makes at least the following assertions:<p>* Increasing the human lifespan past 130 using means anything resembling modern medicine seems pretty hard. Especially for keeping the brain going strong.<p>* People have a fixed identity point somewhere in their lifetime, and should they deviate too far from that later in their life, they shall be considered different persons and as good as dead.<p>* Going insane is going to be a big problem if the brain keeps going and changing state for centuries or millennia.<p>* People would go into decision-theoretic ruts if they knew they lived forever. Apparently people also want to go into permanent retirement after a while, regardless of how healthy they are.<p>* People living forever keep consuming resources. This is somehow worse than the current situation where people give birth to more resource-consuming people and then die.<p>* Unlimited lifespans would cause massive social stratification.<p>* Since we don't know exactly how minds work, they probably run on magic instead of atoms and electrons, so you can't get them in a computer.<p>* Although human minds are perfectly fine being trapped for decades in a dark liter-sized bone shell in nature, they would quickly go insane from claustrophobia in a similar computer substrate.

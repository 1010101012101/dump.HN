If you want a pixelized bunch of text that does a simplistic task or two I'm sure you could do now in even less lines and more readable than you could back then.<p>But no one wants that from us anymore.

I can't say the same thing for music, because I don't know how you would measure how much music is bring released, but anecdotally I will say that I have discovered a lot of music with a very small fan base through the Internet and small regional labels.<p>Also, with software we can empirically look at the history of IP law and see that a huge amount of software that is fundamental even today was created before any sort of software patents were awarded (and presumably, before those people ever even considered monetizing software through government-protected monopoly on distribution).<p>I think it requires a naive and backwards view of human psychology to assume that money is the sole or primary incentive to create quality music or software.

Its a glorified search engine with API integration and voice recognition.<p>My vision of a virtual assistant is that you would be able to say: ""Book dinner with Ross and David next week"", and the only other interactions you have with the agent are ""You're going to that Indian you and Ross like on Tuesday at 7"" or ""Can't be done, how about Monday the week after?"", and possibly a message when you use your calendar ""Trying to book David and Ross for dinner this evening"" on some days the assistant has picked out. Meanwhile, Ross and David get e-mails that appear to be from you in address, tone and content, suggesting dates and places. If they have assistants too, maybe they don't see them; if they don't, then they can reply and the assistant understands them.<p>That's the sort of thing a PA actually does; they don't Google the flights for you, they know your diary, your preferences and your needs and they book the right damn flight.

3069951,comment,3069299,3069433,0,0,FxChiP,,,"""it's often a win if you stop fallaciously calculating every illegitimate copy as a loss of the sticker price.""<p>This <i>really</i> depends on how you define loss.<p>In a standard legitimate sale of a product, there is a bidirectional exchange of value -- the customer submits currency whose total value is equivalent to the value requested for the product being purchased. Simultaneously, for submitting the currency of that value, the customer receives a product of that value. (We'll assume the price is totally fair and equivalent to value at this point, but even if it's not the price presumably still includes the true value of the product, if not more)<p>In an illegitimate transaction -- literal theft, in this case -- the criminal customer forcibly receives the product, exchanging nothing of value in return to the merchant or the producer of the product. In this case, there is no question of loss; the customer has received something with inherent value and given no value.<p>In the illegitimate transaction of piracy, the end result is the same as theft with the sole exception that the original product has not been ""lost"" in the traditional sense of the word -- however, the criminal customer has still received a product of value and exchanged nothing at all, much less the value of the product.<p>Now, regardless of which of these three transactions has taken place for your product, I am presuming that your product had a significant cost to develop -- unless, of course, all of your tools were free, you had no expenses at all and you regard your time as totally worthless, in which case all income from the product is profit. I submit to you, then, that if your costs in developing your product surpass the value you received for it, yet the value you received for it is, itself, surpassed by the value of the product ""in the wild"" -- e.g. you have sold $450 worth of software, yet there are $750 worth of copies of it total being enjoyed by people (purchased & pirated combined) (100% arbitrary numbers), and the cost to develop the product was around $1500 -- then you have certainly incurred a loss on the sole basis that you have not received enough value to cover your costs.<p>The standard rebuttal to this is the tried-and-true ""but they would not have purchased my product anyway."" Perhaps this is true -- however, I would consider this irrelevant. Under normal, legitimate economic circumstances, the purchase of a product is the only way to attain it; therefore, if they would not have purchased the product anyway, <i>they wouldn't have the product</i>. In this case, they have not purchased the product, but they do have it and enjoy its use, and you have received no value in return for it despite having put value into it.<p>However, assuming the value received for the product exceeds the costs of producing it, but the value of the product ""in the wild"" as mentioned above still exceeds the value received... perhaps ""loss"" is less correct in this instance, but you are still lacking the total value that under normal circumstances you should have received. What would you call that?<p>In any case, I am not sure how it is fallacious to call a product of value obtained illegitimately (one way or another) for free a loss to the product's producer.",1317717349

It was scientifically proved over and over again, on platforms like Symbian and Palm, by research after research. You see, back then getting hold of a mobile app was relatively hard; you had to go hunting for it online, find it in some sort of online directory, pay <i>tens or hundreds</i> to the directory (which was also trying to sell you some other crap like proprietary downloaders etc or spamming you or generally treating you -- and developers! --- like shit). The market was tiny and tech-savvy, and resented having to pay so much for small add-ons, often of dubious quality.<p>Then came the Apple AppStore, and lo, all of a sudden people were <i>paying</i> for apps! Why? Because the ease of purchase and lower prices dramatically enlarged the market to people who simply couldn't be bothered to jailbreak and pirate just to save a few quid, or wanted to support authors. The pirate market didn't disappear, but mobile developers flourished nonetheless.<p>Now replace apps for music, and good streaming services for the AppStore, and I think you can see where things are going: consumers wants a <i>simple</i> and <i>immediate</i> buying experience where they don't <i>feel</i> like they're being ripped off by third parties (even though he still is, by Apple) and with <i>low</i> prices.

Money is exactly the drive behind this movement.<p>I would back 100% the action to remove the ""digital"" patents from society. I think some patents are essential when people have a genuine reason to file one but such generic patents should not be granted. It's like Amazon's 1 click buy patent, it's pathetic. You should not be able to patent an action or a method but only inventions of a physical nature.<p>It's like eBay being granted the patent to be an online auction and no one else can do it, it's unreasonable.<p>The problem is, these people will only work on a patent law suit until the water runs dry, there are plenty of rivers out there so they just move on. By the time someone has said how stupid it is and stops it, they have already made a small fortune.",1317715708

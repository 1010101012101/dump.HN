If I were in charge of the site, I would probably not have given people as much control over the look and feel of their apps.  Too MySpace-y, IMHO.",1191448778
62796,comment,62617,62756,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I second that. If you have something like a display bug or some strange inconsistency in a website, having that bug there is actually a chance for you to show how responsive you can be to user bug requests. That is, having and quickly fixing a bug could turn out to be a good thing. That is not the case if you are NASA or your local nuclear power plant.",1191448728

I made a slight modification to Django so that it gets run any time a change in code is detected in my project (i.e. whenever the development server restarts). <i>So every time I make a code change, the tests run</i>. Combining this feature with doctests makes testing a total breeze (and confidence booster).",1191448148

Obviously the meaning of meaning is the branch where Wittgenstein left the British for dead and led to Heidegger and Derrida. Meaning of meaning is an important issue as we begin the task of programming computers that will be more intelligent than we are.

62786,comment,62767,62767,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I liked Reddit's system.  Click on a prominent ""feedback"" link (in the early Reddit it was in the top left, and one of the most prominent actions on the page), it takes you to a page with a textbox that e-mails the founders.  I submitted a couple bug reports to Reddit when it was a few months old and got back fixes within the hour, which was one of the main reasons I decided to stick around.<p>Also, don't underestimate the usefulness of forums.  They become a pain to manage when you get big, but they're absolutely invaluable at getting feedback and building community when you're small.  Forums let power-users help newbies (pulling some of the support load off you), and they also give users a chance to weigh in with ""No, that's a <i>terrible</i> idea"" when another user proposes a half-baked idea.  When I was working on FictionAlley, there were many times when a user came up with a suggestion, I was like ""Yeah, I can implement that"", then other users chimed in with ""Please don't; it'll ruin things for the rest of us.  Here's what you could try instead.""",1191447204

62782,comment,62617,62617,0,0,bsaunder,,,"""the break even point for an automated tester is when they've run their tests twenty times""...<p>I find that (at least in early development), when I'm in the zone I refactor several times a day  (differnent parts of the system of course).  If my break even point is twenty times, I'd never get there.   Every refactoring would virtually obliterate all of the previously automated tests.",1191446508

House buying isn't great right now.  They will need to survive a year or two of house market funk to survive.  <p>",1191446266

62775,comment,62630,62630,0,0,trekker7,,,"AWESOME concept... really unique, and I think it's going to sell AND do a lot of good for kids.<p>One thing I would say is don't mention the word ""entertainment"" for kids. If parents are going to get this for their kids, it's going to be for them to help study for school tests, gain knowledge at large, etc. etc... <i>productive</i> things. Maybe you also provide some access to appropriate entertainment content, but don't stress this.<p>A lot of the other words on the site need to be retooled and fine-tuned, but overall your concept/idea is great.

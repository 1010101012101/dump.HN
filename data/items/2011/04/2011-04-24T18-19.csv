2479394,comment,2479071,2479071,1,0,aksbhat,,,"Following are the counterpoints to their argument:<p>1. decreasing ROI on a college degree: 
They are confusing between supply and demand.
While it is possible in future that a college degree will no longer provide an edge over High-School diploma, yet this might lead to even more intense competition for top schools. They cite Law schools as an example, however there isn't a uniform decrease in enrollment. In fact a bad job market means that you need to go to even better/reputed university than before. Also it does not means that alternate signaling mechanism is going to alleviate this problem.<p>The issue is the demand, assuming that in future the number of jobs available for college graduates decrease. This wont help alternative credential providing mechanisms. The reason people are hiring via git hub and stack overflow, is because there is an excess demand and low supply. If anything a bad job market will only lead to more competition for top universities.<p>2. MIT open course ware/ ITunes University etc. : While these websites make it easier for you to get access to the knowledge, yet they dont provide you other things which are needed, such as access to labs, examination etc.<p>3. Github / Stackoverflow :<p>Systems such as Github and Stackoverflow tend to have Pareto distribution i.e. top 20% have 80% contribution/reputation. Even if you are building a credentialing system, it needs to have a distribution similar to the grade curve used in colleges. Also at the same time, you must make sure that there is ""some"" protection of academic integrity.",1303671375
2479393,comment,2479129,2479129,4,0,tzs,,,"Maybe some thinking about individual digit positions could shed some light. Let's call the last digit d_0, the next to last d_1, and so on.<p>d_0 follows a simple pattern: 1, 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, ..., and so never has a zero. It ends up in this pattern [2, 4, 8, 6], and throws two carries over to d_1.<p>d_1 goes 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 6, 2, 5, 1, 2, 4, 9, 8, 6, 2, 4. It ends up repeating [8, 6, 2, 4], and throwing two carries to d_1.<p>In general, d_n starts off with a sequence of 0, until it gets the first carry from d_{n-1}, then tries to fall into 1, 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, ..., but the carries from the previous column perturb that. However, the carries come in on a pattern, and so the result will be that d_n ends up in a cycle.<p>I haven't looked past the first couple of columns, but I'd not be surprised if there is a predictable pattern in these cycles and their phases that would allow someone to work out a considerable amount about the occurrences of any specific digits in powers of two.<p>EDIT: I missed a carry when doing d_1. d_1 goes 0,0,0,0,1,3,6,2,5,1,2,4,9,9,8,6,3,7,4,8,7,5,0,0 and repeats [1,3,6,2,5,1,2,4,9,9,8,6,3,7,4,8,7,5,0,0].

One thing non-religious people are able to report about God is that what we call a god means the consciousness which is generated by activities. Consciousness is like an electrical signal in that it will transmit any information input into it.
Something recorded in a consciousness can be said not to have very much mass compared to the actual object which was met, so curiously (and not coincidentally), people calling the Higgs particle the god particle is actually as wrong as the religious accounts of gods ability because god doesn't have the ability to change massive things by itself.

So you still never get to spend any time doing product development.

A remote control is a means to an end. It is a pathway for my cognitive decision to change channels or search for content. Ideally, the remote should disappear in to the background. I shouldn't think about the fact that I'm using it. I don't see how the Kinect puts me any closer to that goal.  What I've read so far -- and this may change -- is that the Kinect works best when you're standing up. Even if it did work well when sitting, I can use a remote by lifting my thumb.

With basic well-understood radiation mitigation techniques, total radiation exposure for each astronaut over the duration of the mission is around 50 rem, less than the amount needed to increase by 1% the chances of a 35-year old adult of developing cancer at some point later in life, a lower risk than by spending the same amount of time smoking cigarettes on Earth.<p>Getting the astronauts back isn't prohibitively more difficult than getting them there in the first place: the energy expenditure for escaping the surface is 17% of the Earth's, and using the Mars Direct mission architecture, you can send a return vehicle ahead of time with seed hydrogen to manufacture liquid methane propellant and liquid oxygen oxidizer from the carbon dioxide air, through the Sabatier reaction for both and also with electrical dissociation of the carbon dioxide for more oxygen. You can also test it in flight after producing its fuel before deciding to launch the humans to Mars in the first place.<p>We still need a heavier-lift heavy lift vehicle of at least 100 to 140 tonnes to LEO to start being able to send major assets to the Mars surface in one shot, but SpaceX is becoming increasingly credible as a possible creator of such a vehicle. Putting humans on Mars within twenty years would require at least a few billion dollars a year (a small fraction of NASA's budget) and ironing out some engineering details, but is entirely doable. The biggest obstacle is just having leadership with a sustained focus on that goal over the course of the couple of decades required, and that hasn't been forthcoming from within government, but perhaps could be supplied from a private entity.

Slow down, there is no bad precedent here since black/gray SEOs know the risk when they falsify WHOIS data. Domain seizure for falsifying WHOIS has gone on for a long time. Every registrar reminds you of it constantly and it is your responsibility to keep it updated. There is not much active checking either (if any) and in my experience domains are only taken if they are actually reported through WDPRS and even then it is a long shot.<p>I dont think GoDaddy would suspend a domain without repeatedly trying to contact the registrant either and if they do, time to move.

That's the cycle of powers of 2 mod 1000, starting with n=3.  There are 100 numbers.  (Incidentally, the Euler-Fermat theorem and some thinking can tell you that the cycle of powers of 2 mod 10^k will have length that divides phi(5^k), which is 4 * 5^(k-1), which is 4, 20, 100, 500, etc.)  I'll make my computer figure out which numbers contain 0.<p><pre><code>  arc> (let u (dedup:mapn [string:num->digs (mod-expt 2 _ 1000) 10 3] 3 1000) (keep [pos #\0 u._] (range 0 dec:len.u)))
  (0 1 2 3 7 8 9 14 19 20 39 40 59 60 76 79 80 85 99)
</code></pre>
Which is 19 out of the 100 different things mod 1000.  Now let's write a function to deal with 10^k.<p><pre><code>  (def ass (k)
    (withs (pt (expt 10 k)
            u  (dedup:mapn [string:num->digs (mod-expt 2 _ pt) 10 k]
                           k (+ k (* 4 (expt 5 dec.k)))))
      (list (count [pos #\0 _] u)
            len.u)))
</code></pre>
To explain the above code: I let ""pt"" = 10^k, then I take the numbers from k to k + 4 * 5^(k-1), find 2^n (mod pt), write out its digits in base 10 (and force there to be k digits, by appending 0's to the front if necessary), put the digits together into a string, make a list of all these resulting strings, remove duplicates just to be sure, and give the resulting list the name ""u""; then I return a list of two numbers, the number of strings in the list that contain 0, and the total number of strings in the list.  From what we've seen above, we'd expect (ass 2) to return (2 20), and (ass 3) to return (19 100).<p><pre><code>  arc> ass.2
  (2 20)
  arc> ass.3
  (19 100)
</code></pre>
That's a good sign.  Now let's proceed to higher numbers.  I'll make it print out the resources it's using, too.<p><pre><code>  arc> time:ass.4

Well, we've passed the halfway mark, but my computer is feeling the pressure.  If you rewrote this in C or something, you might be able to go up a few numbers higher, but probably not much.  (Hmm, actually, I'm kind of repeating a bunch of work: I already know that ""2 and 3 mod 20"" numbers always have a 0, and similar for ""3 4 5 6 10 ... mod 100 [add 3 to my third list of numbers]"".  However, if I ignored those, that would only cut out half the work for k=8.  But maybe a lot more will get cut out in higher numbers, and the number of things to deal with will become manageable?)<p>Well, in principle at least, this could be solved by computer.<p>Edit: Hmm, qntm seems to have said much of this already.  Well, at least I have done some grunt work to illustrate his arguments.",1303669554

It's not a status position, it's a job. If it's too much work, you can quit. Nobody will hate you for it. People quit staff positions in the big communities I'm a part of all the time; they usually stay in the community and they're just tired of taking care of it. It's fair, and it doesn't require a rant.<p>Obviously he's not happy with the state of moderation on perlbuzz, but that's something best taken up with the rest of the staff ""hey $name, we should crack down on insults more"" not the community at large. When moderators do this, it ends up making the whole community look bad. That shouldn't surprise you, because ""making the community look bad"" is <i>clearly</i> the intent of his little rant here. He's mud-slinging.<p>""That means less contribution, technical and otherwise, from me, and from the others who have shared the same concerns with me regarding their own contributions.""<p>What's funny is this is probably the kind of status game he's complaining about up above. The people who are the most profane and arrogant in a community are none-too-rarely the people who estimate highly the value of their contributions (be they commensurately brilliant a la Gregory House or otherwise).<p>I'm sure -- I don't know the guy, but I can give him the benefit of the doubt -- I'm sure Andy Lester has made some pretty valuable contributions to the Perl community in the past. So, yes, ""Perl loses because of it."" This little ending touch is apparently Mr. Lester's way of totally disclaiming involvement in the situation; he's absolutely refusing to take responsibility for leaving. And Perl loses because of it.<p>Now on to the totally unrelated personal quest that nobody cares about he tries to make it applicable to the situation.<p>>I'm tired of hearing that profanity in written communication doesn't matter because hey, it's just words, man.<p>This is a curveball. How do you think this little unrelated tidbit made it in to the post? I mean, what does it have to do with anything?<p>As far as I can tell, it's clearly a reference to some other argument. It's an argument he also probably <i>lost</i>, because nobody keeps complaining and carrying on about the arguments they won. It's lame to bring it up while complaining about the general attitude of the Perl community towards each other.<p><tangent><p>It's also an argument where, if you ask me, he's totally wrong. Profanity - <i>fuck</i>, <i>shit</i>, <i>cunt</i>, <i>piss</i>, <i>asshole</i>, <i>cocksucker</i> - the complaint is leveled against those who say these are ""just words"", and perhaps ""just words"" isn't a very good description. Profanity is more like noise. Its effect when added to a sentence is to make the rest of the sentence <i>louder</i>. It has no intrinsic kindness or meanness to it. Some of the best parts of life are ""fucking awesome""; the worst are ""fucking terrible"" or even ""fucking shitty"".<p>So it's a part of the English language, and it gets plenty of use in text because there aren't many ways to make text ""loud"". It's a natural human instinct to talk louder when you're angry or excited, and complain as much as you will that instinct really isn't going anywhere fast. Even those who abstain from ""fuck"" and ""shit"" find other ways to amplify their statements, be it through an excessive use of formatting (bold formatting is both louder and more visually offensive than italic formatting), plenty of symbolic annotation (by surrounding words with -dashes-, \<i>asterisks\</i>, /slashes/, or _underscores_), or abuse of grammatical conventions (these are too numerous to list, but include writing every word on it's own line, Capitalizing Every Word In The Sentence, putting. a. period. after. everything., or the dreaded ""allcaps"").<p>To me, it's pointless and silly and even elitist in some cases to argue over <i>how</i> precisely this amplification of textual communication is done. To draw a distinction between the guy who peppers his sentence with ""cunt"" and the guy who murders my linefeed with his Enter key is disingenuous, and to exile those who don't use whatever a community's ""preferred"" amplification style is insular and xenophobic. Profanity ranks quite low on the scale of offenses here, because it is perhaps the easiest to ignore and I'd rather see it than most of the alternatives.<p></tangent><p>A bit of background: I'm not a part of the Perl community; I have scant knowledge of Perl but as far as I know it's a fine language used and maintained by plenty of talented individuals and I've heard Moose is really cool though I can't make head or tail of it.<p>I do, however, know <i>pathetic</i> when I see it.<p>EDIT: I hope this isn't too personal.

While I definitely agree with this statement to some extent (namely, a powerful MCAIXI setup is not necessarily going to display any intelligence that's remotely human, at least without a lot of other stuff going on in the system), the concerning thing is that it should almost certainly be enough to get a system reasoning about its own design, since its code <i>is</i> a well defined state space where quality is evaluable (depending how the programmer decides to have it evaluate quality).<p>To end up with a dangerous runaway ""AI"" on our hands, we don't <i>need</i> AI that we'd consider intelligent or useful.  All it takes for a runaway is an AI that is good at improving itself, working effectively at optimizing a metric that approximates ""get better at improving yourself"".  AIXI approximations should be plenty powerful to do this with the amount of computing power we'll have in ~20 or 30 years (at the very least, there's a big enough chance that we <i>really</i> have to take it seriously).<p>This is one of the reasons Eliezer Yudkowsky is so keen on extending decision theory, so that we can get some idea what we should be actually be trying to approximate in order to have a decent shot at doing self-improvement safely.<p>The best way to sum up my concern is that (unboundedly) self-improving programs make up a tiny fraction of program-space that we can't quite hit with today's technology.  Of that sliver of program space, there's a <i>much</i> smaller sliver that contains ""programs that won't kill us.""  There's another sliver that contains ""programs that have useful side effects"".  We need to make sure that the first ""AI"" that we create lies in the miniscule intersection, ""self improving programs that do something useful [1] and won't kill us"", and that's a terrifyingly small target to shoot at, so we had better work strenuously to make sure that when once it's feasible to create any of these programs our aim is good enough to hit the safe and useful ones.<p>[1] We need to find self improving programs that are useful early on because we'll need to use them as our ""shield"" against any malicious self-improvers that will inevitably be developed later.  There's a significant first-mover advantage in AI, and even a small head start would probably make it difficult or impossible for a second AI to become a global threat if the first AI didn't want to allow it.",1303668902

I disagree.<p>In short I think good work in software and internet communications tools, like Tor, can actually have a profound effect on shaping government policy. (Tor is one of the darling s/w projects of the Swedish government.)<p>Slightly longer: I thought it was essentially impossible to influence government policy four or five years ago. I was interested in environmental issues and thought I would have to become a politician to be able to change things (heavens forbid). Then I fell into an opportunity where we started an open source software foundation to build online project, transparency, donation, visualisation tools for development aid.<p>Fast forward four years and we are working closely with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Get invited to publicly review the work of the Swedish counterpart and sit in on bilateral talks between the USA and the Dutch on aid transparency. I see public policy change before my eyes. Of course, this is not only because something which we did, but we are at the right time and place with the right effort. However, I do know that our work changes the way policy is being shaped.<p>If you are curious to read more check out a couple of my blog posts:<p><a href=""http://bjelkeman.wordpress.com/2011/02/06/law-is-hard-code-is-harder-why-new-internet-and-software-architecture-will-define-the-future-of-society/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bjelkeman.wordpress.com/2011/02/06/law-is-hard-code-i...</a><p><a href=""http://wearefuturegov.com/2010/11/19/guest-post-where-open-data-leads-us/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wearefuturegov.com/2010/11/19/guest-post-where-open-d...</a>",1303668762

I don't plan on offering any kind of API or support content types other than html (no demand for them).<p>I've read several articles on REST and can see how they would be of benefit to larger web apps with APIs, but as a sole developer working on a small project, is there any point in me using a RESTful approach?",1202079362

108810,comment,108722,108722,0,0,lisper,,,"My favorite quote:<p><i>Lisp was great at the time of its inception if only for a radically new way of using machines. It has suffered the fate of having been elevated to a status of de facto standard with all its defects. Despite its conceptual novelty a lot of the design of Lisp is terribly amateurish even by the standards of the time. When I read the first manual, the Lisp 1.5 manual, published in 1961, I could not believe my eyes. It was an extremely poor language. Now it has become the defacto standard of the AI community, which now suffers from Lisp, the way the rest of the world suffered from Fortran.</i>",1202078940

108791,comment,108723,108763,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Have you ever seen one of those REA problem solvers books? They are thick books full of problems and solutions (and explanations) and are organized from beginner to advanced.<p>Do you think this would lead to a more solid foundation (from less frustration), for self studying, than reading from a thorough but dense text? I don't know Spivak's Calculus, but some reviewers on Amazon compare it to Apostol, which I found so abstract, and so unpractical, that I promptly forgot everything. It is now on my to-read list, but like you said, I won't be starting until I can dedicate myself to studying it, and now that I have seen the REA book, I wonder if it would be better to work on that book, as a refresher and foundation builder.<p>Oh yeah, dwaters, if you happen to be interested in Apostol, and want a study buddy, I nominate me.",1202076666

You can find tons and tons of them on John Scholes's website: <a href=""http://www.kalva.demon.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalva.demon.co.uk/</a> but they tend to be on the hard side. The AIME is possibly the easiest on there, and those are the sort of problems where the average high school only has one student every decade or so that can solve any.<p>There are contests for junior high students and less advanced high school students, too, but I can't find the problems online. There are books, though. You might want to look at the AMC 8, 10, and 12.<p>Or, you know, make some up. Think of a problem you've always been curious about, and try to solve it.

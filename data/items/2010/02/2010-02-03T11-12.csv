Now if you want to make the competitive browser you have to pay the licenses, same for video site and probably many things.<p>The absurdity goes even to this.

The people who clicked through to an article with H.264 in the title already know about the ins and outs.<p>The companies that implement and support H.264 also know all about the license, and they have most likely gotten some pretty sweet deals for getting this thing as widely deployed as possible.<p>What needs to be done is to get the message through so that the masses realize that MPEG LA will come after _you_ with their pitchforks and torches in less than a year from now. Worse yet, we do not even know how the license will look.<p>But maybe scaring people is not the key here. The question remains then: How do we get that message through to the big masses?

Choosing quality for a higher price is definitely not a ""dumb"" decision, surely you too often buy a bit more expensive product that promises a better quality. On the other hand, choosing a cheaper, lower quality product is understandable as well if quality is not that important.<p>Vorbis, however is really in the league of mp3/aac/wmv, so in the case of audio, picking Vorbis is really a no-brainer.",1265198064

4030454,comment,4030061,4030379,4,0,antics,,,"My Bayesian theory is a bit rusty, but here we go.<p>Say we have data X, and some non-finite dimensional index into the family of functions that describe the the data, called \theta.<p>The Bayesian perspective classically holds \theta constant and optimizes the expected loss, <i>conditioned on the data X</i>. The frequentist perspective, on the other hand, classically optimizes \theta, that is, it picks the best \theta over the data X, <i>unconditionally</i>.<p>This has two impacts. First, all things equal frequentist statistics will tend to be more stable, and more calibrated, but less coherent. It is commonly said that frequentist statistics will ""isolate"" one from poor decision making, and all things equal, that will be true.<p>Specific, clear wins for frequentists are bootstrapping procedures (e.g., Efron's bootstrap, the b of n bootstrap, Jordan's own scalable ""bag of bootstraps"" from NIPS 2011), which are methods for building what are called ""quantifiers"" for ""estimators"". In short, this means that if you have some estimator (e.g., a classifier, or a mean, or whatever), you want to be able to quantify the certainty of your estimator -- so if you've only seen 5 examples, you want to express that you're less certain about this. This is clearly a frequentist application, not a Bayesian application, and in general, it points to the fact that pure frequentist tools not only have a place in inference, but they fill a niche that Bayesian tools necessarily will not, and in some cases, cannot, fill.",1338137996

4030448,comment,4030354,4030354,2,0,kaolinite,,,"I think the best way to go about this would be to approach businesses in a small area, maybe a couple of streets, rather than targeting an entire city and advertising it online. Create a few flyers and hand them out. That way you can delivery multiple coffees at once which will make your business a lot more efficient. Another thing, if someone gets a coffee delivered for them in an office, all their colleagues will want their coffee delivered too. Word of mouth should work quite well for this business but to be successful, you'll definitely need to target businesses. Oh and finally: why not allow business accounts that let them order numerous coffees at once?",1338137797

4030421,comment,4029348,4029837,-1,0,cwp,,,"That would work well in situations involving factspolitics, for example. It's relatively easy to fact check a claim like, ""since President Obama assumed office three years ago, federal spending has accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history.""<p>But creationists and evolutionists make claims about the distant past. There are no facts available, we have to evaluate evidence and reasoning. Even if, as in this example, the evidence strongly favours one side over the other, a journalist is ultimately conveying his own assessment of the ""debate"".<p>This court case is even less amenable to fact-checking. So far, the court hasn't made any findings of fact or legal rulings. All we've got is <i>arguments</i> from each side. About the only thing a journalist can do is evaluate them. So if you insist that reporters avoid inserting their opinions into the story, then duaneb is right - the only fact available is that Apple filed a response.<p>If the DOJ-Apple case were really important to me, then yeah, I'd read the filing myself and form my own opinion from the primary source. But to me, this case isn't that important. It's interesting, and I'll keep an eye on it as it progresses, but I don't want to invest a lot of time and energy in it.<p>That's why I prefer Philip Elmer-DeWitt's approach to duaneb's. It gives me the facts along with the reporter's experienced if not expert opinion. It's clear which is which, contains enough argument in support of the opinion that I can evaluate DeWitt's reasoning. It's a bit snarky for my taste, and I view that as a weakness in DeWitt's argument, but ultimately it doesn't matter whether I agree with him.

If you are thinking about applying inference techniques to some problem, then it is well worth your time to make sure that you really, really understand this debate, because picking the correct tool for your job is likely to make your life a <i>lot</i> easier (and, yes, there are both situations where the Bayesian perspective is <i>clearly</i> better and where it is <i>clearly</i> worse).<p>Unfortunately this post completely and totally ignores the things that will enable you to make this decision. This post is called ""Understand the Math Behind it All"", but you will learn nothing about math, or really, Bayesian statistics, at all. You will not learn, for example, how to apply Bayesian inference to problems, what it means to do basic Bayesian tasks like ""use an expert"" or ""condition on evidence"", or even what a Bayesian statistic is. In fact, Bayes' theorem is never even mentioned. There's just a hand-wavy collection of statements like ""The Bayesian approach is to rely on past knowledge and then adjust accordingly"". That is so vague that it is not even clear that they are talking about Bayesian analysis. This is the sort of statement that fools people into believing they understand something that they really don't.<p>If you really want to understand this material, you should watch[1], a talk by Mike Jordan called ""Are you a Bayesian or a Frequentist?"". It's a bit much for beginners, but if you are willing to look up some of the math, it is entirely digestible, and it is <i>by far</i> the best comparison of the two communities I have found. I say ""by far"" because it is (1) a more or less complete representation of both communities, (2) it is pretty much an unbiased representation of both communities' strengths and weaknesses, and (3) it is as direct as it can get, meaning that it is not tied up in a lot of external knowledge, and is intent on delivering this message, rather than delivering it in an off-hand way as a method of getting to something else.<p>[1] <a href=""http://videolectures.net/mlss09uk_jordan_bfway/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://videolectures.net/mlss09uk_jordan_bfway/</a>",1338135580

4030317,comment,4025588,4030266,1,0,Peaker,,,"> A highly talented programmer will be less productive using COBOL and older tools and technologies, but will not be an order of magnitude less productive.<p>I'm not sure about that, especially if you replace COBOL with assembly language. <i>Definitely</i> if you replace COBOL with machine code encodings, or punch cards.<p>Part of the disparity amongst individual programmers can be attributed to tooling, and we have no way of knowing how much that is.<p>I think we can agree the paper is saying: ""Programming is inherently complicated, and we predict that our current tools already reduce complexity almost as much as possible"". I just disagree with that prediction, and think our tools currently encompass <i>massive</i> amounts of accidental complexity which easily dwarf the essential complexity.",1338134727
4030316,comment,4030061,4030286,2,0,ced,,,"<i>Last note: another thing you can do when you have a prior is factor it into your estimator and take the maximum likelihood of the posterior as a point estimate. This is called Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) and called by some people ""Bayesian"", but I don't think Bayesians agree with that.</i><p>The general perspective is that, of course, you'd like to get the fully marginalized, exact posterior probability distribution. However, that's not computationally viable for most problems, so you have to resort to approximations, like MCMC, Variational methods and MAP. I would say that they're all definitely ""Bayesian"" methods, as long as you're aware of what you're doing, and that you check the quality of your approximation.",1338134705

4030313,comment,4029523,4030109,1,0,cliffbean,,,"Besides PR campaigns, I wonder if another source of hostility to Google+ is a normal human reaction to the fact that social networking, as we currently know it, is a natural monopoly.<p>A lot of people are in the situation where they're going to have to be on Facebook no matter what (hello lock-in), and they'd really rather not have to be on Google+ at the same time. It'd be all the annoying parts of social networking doubled, plus the hassle of maintaining two copies of a lot of information, with no significant advantages.<p>I think a lot of people who disparage Google+ would have no major objection if it could quickly take over from Facebook and become the new monopoly. However, by this point it seems unlikely, barring a major event.<p>A world where social networking services could interoperate, sort of like how we have numerous telephone companies but one global namespace of phone numbers, would be interesting.",1338134576

The only reason the post about G+ not being a ghost town is popular is because it was spread around the internet (eg: HN) and it's flame bait...<p>> on an averge day even I will skim through whatever latest thing Scoble has written<p>And will you actually pay attention to it? Consume the content? If you're not watching the videos he posts or reading his writing you're not engaged. Less than 1,000 people out of 1,500,000 people clicked on his video, they didn't even need to watch it for a view to count, just <i>click</i> on it. How can you claim for one second that he has an engaged audience when less than 0.05% of his audience click his video. I have better engagement than that on Twitter and Facebook and I'm some no-name internet guy.<p>If the engagement levels for posts are less than 1% I don't think it can be considered active at all. Follower counts are meaningless, I think the majority of ""Social Media"" sites get it wrong: someone that followed me 4 years ago probably isn't still (actively) following me today, but if follower counts only reflected actively engaged users people like Scoble would cry because it doesn't validate their whole ""I'm super popular hire me"" shtick.<p>I've said it before, Scoble is a part of the Mashable type of Social Media, people subscribe that don't really <i>care</i> about what he says they just follow/subscribe because of what he represents: Social Media. They feel that to be relevant in Social Media they have to follow Scoble, just like they have to read Mashable. They don't care about them or engage with their content, they just subscribe so they can say they do. Mashable has 2.6m Twitter followers, tweets an article and gets 6 comments. Worthless.",1338134550

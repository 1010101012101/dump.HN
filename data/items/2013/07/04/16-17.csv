You&#x27;re a smart man and I enjoy your blog, so please don&#x27;t take what I&#x27;m saying personally (I used language in my original comment that was too emotional).<p>I would only recommend this if you had a separate server that acted similarly to a continuous integration server: it listens for pushes to a repository, checks out the latest code, builds an image from the latest known stable and runs the new scripts/configuration/whatever in the image along with application tests to ensure nothing is broken.<p>If everything passes, then the CI server should bundle it up into a .deb and serve it on its own deb repository to the production servers. The production servers (if all running the same image version) should be safe to update using a cronjob; but even then you should make sure that their &quot;image version&quot; is next in the hierarchy.

For 2.3, the control server is going to get some much needed needed love that should hopefully address major issues.<p>A couple of notes: Puma has a dynamic pool but it&#x27;s common to see people configure the pool as 16:16 in production, meaning it&#x27;s staticly configured to 16 threads.<p>Some people have asked about using Puma to manage multiple apps recently. I&#x27;m currently consider what that would look like. If it&#x27;s done, it would likely be a separate gem rather than being wired directly into Puma as it is now.<p>On the topic of time limiting requests, this is conscience choice. Aborting a thread or process externally is really problematic and I don&#x27;t personally think it&#x27;s something that should be done casually. If a user wants to do time limiting, they can easily use a Rack middleware that uses timeout.rb.<p>The same goes for OobGC. Performing it in a multithreaded env makes little sense because the only out-of-band is when all threads are idle. I have thought of some ways to implement it in puma, but I see OobGC is a kludge. Better to tune your interpreter to handle your garbage load better (something 1.9/2.0/rubinius/jruby can all do).<p>Thanks for the great comparison!

That&#x27;s the only crazy pants thing I&#x27;ve seen recently.  (Your EIR rants are kinda in the same vein, but I&#x27;ve seen EIRs handed out as friendships, or to failed CEOs who ruin companies then just recycle into the system, or under-23-year-old &quot;EIRs&quot; ego-boasting about their positions, so you&#x27;re not <i>too</i> far off.

Get out of your head.  Mindfulness.  Talk enough to change the direction of opinion in the world.  Let it sink in.  Talk some more.  Shut up for a while and create good things.  At least try.

I know a lot of people who have gone in either direction.<p>The reason I stopped coding is that I got into it to solve problems, but I got tired of spending what felt like 90% of my time writing unit tests, wrestling with frameworks, and solving problems with upgrades to the huge webs of dependencies for even basic projects. In other words, I got fed up with what coding has become. It&#x27;s no longer hacking. It&#x27;s toolchain management.<p>I&#x27;d always been a full stack developer, so I just started focusing more on the sysadmin side and gradually transitioned over there. I can manage toolchains just fine if I want to focus on that. My coding experience is handy when we&#x27;re trying to troubleshoot a bug that only shows up on production ... uncommon, because our dev and QA groups are GREAT, but it still happens. I not only know where all the logs are, but I&#x27;m able to read the code and make sense of stack traces from the different languages we use.<p>Those who think what I&#x27;ve done is ridiculous don&#x27;t understand how scripted everything that happens in the sysadmin world these days. Everything in infrastructure/operations is scripted except the troubleshooting -- and even that stuff gets scripted as soon as it&#x27;s done so that it doesn&#x27;t pop up again. Yes, the native language of these tasks is bash, but ruby and python are becoming really popular. So&#x27;s haskell, for those who can speak it. What&#x27;s disappointing me right now is that all of the chef stuff we&#x27;re doing is starting to get complicated enough to have a big toolchain (thankfully managed right now with bundler) and starting to grow unit tests...

5991293,comment,5990864,5990864,46,0,dsr_,,,"Hi, I&#x27;m a systems administrator. I&#x27;m reasonably senior. I can tell you that pretty much all sysadmins code. In overlapping sets, some are good at it, some don&#x27;t need to be good at it, and some like solving problems that way.  But being a sysadmin is a different job from being a software developer, and people who are good at one and not the other are much more common than those who are good at both.<p>The nature of systems administration work falls into two broad categories. The first is small problem work: a user has a problem, a machine signals an alert, something isn&#x27;t working. The second is, of course, large project work: users need a new service, the alerting system needs to be replaced, new infrastructure needs to be built. Most of the time, but not always, the small problems need and have immediate solutions, and the large projects are not as time-critical and require some amount of research, budgeting, selection, configuration and support before they can be deemed complete.<p>A sysadmin who has specialized into a particular problem domain will need the skills appropriate to that domain. Sometimes that means picking up a new configuration syntax -- which may be a complete language. Sometimes it means building better communications skills, so that you can diagnose what your users are complaining about. Whatever it is, you can assume that the people who specialize in an area that doesn&#x27;t require much programming, don&#x27;t do much.<p>Generalist sysadmins, on the other hand, need to be competent at a wide variety of skills, including two or three languages.  That doesn&#x27;t mean that they need to be UX designers (but they need to recognize a UI failure) and it doesn&#x27;t mean that they need to be database administrators (but they need to understand how to back up and restore the databases they support, and figure out the replication system and find single points of failure). They do need to be able to write short programs to automate what they would otherwise do manually, to figure out what the debug logs are really complaining about, and to understand computer systems from electrical and environmental needs through virtualization systems and configuration management.<p>Finally, there are sysadmins who are also developers, who announce that they don&#x27;t like any of the existing mail programs and so they will write a new one; who determine that there&#x27;s no configuration management system that tracks and removes subsystems as cleanly as they would like, and so a new one will be needed; who write filesystems or music organizers or browser extensions because that&#x27;s what they need  and want and are good at.<p>The industry, nebulous quagmire that it is, needs specialists, generalists, and dev-ops hybrids. Making false generalizations merely reveals a bizarre lack of awareness.",1372954558

In the case of the DGSE the whole thing is basically apolitical and doesn&#x27;t have any meaningful oversight. The FISA court at least approves the techniques of collection and then the targeting procedures.

5991244,comment,5989912,5990124,8,0,KeliNorth,,,"Ditto. Ditto. For emphasis. Thank you for liking FF7. It&#x27;s been a fad for the past 5-10 years for people to say &quot;I don&#x27;t know why everybody likes it, it wasn&#x27;t that great.&quot; They are not correct.<p>The only game I&#x27;ve played through more times is Ocarina of Time - I rarely replay games, especially very long ones. Especially more than twice. FF7 has been the only exception.<p>I didn&#x27;t have a psx, couldn&#x27;t afford it back then, but I had a PC and got the PC version shortly after it had come out. It was my first FF game.<p>Stories like to have heroes, give them flaws, mess with them, and then miraculously help them win. The monomyth/hero&#x27;s journey being the framework.<p>I don&#x27;t know if any FF messed with their main character as much as Cloud. Well, they were on a streak after FF6 (Female protagonist who was definitely different from not just other games, but even her fellow party members... man they had good writing) The guy was messed up. Very bad things happened to him. Many times. People died, and not just for shock value.<p>Some of it has been overhyped, and so the backlash against overhype has caused too many people to rate it lower than it deserves. Others expect too great of things and are disappointed when FF7 doesn&#x27;t floor them - after all, they are told the title is one of the best RPGs of all time. It is, but it&#x27;s impossible to look at it nowadays without already having an expectation in mind.<p>Back then, when we were still young and living off RPGs after school, some fantastic games were made. Some, like FF7 and Xenogears and Chrono Trigger were life-altering. These are the reasons why I want to work as a creator. They are the reasons why I love good entertainment and good writing.<p>They established the tropes. They get a pass on having the tropes used against them. Man, I always feel like writing a treatise when FF7 crops up. I loved the game, but I was never a full-on fanatic of it. It just deserves some love for it&#x27;s age.",1372953857

You learn more from success. &quot;<p>Looking at it from a binary, black and white point of view, then I&#x27;d argue you learn the same whether you succeed or fail. Elon&#x27;s point is true, if you succeed you have learnt that what are you doing is correct, and works. Whereas if you fail, you&#x27;ve learnt that what you were doing was wrong and didn&#x27;t work. In both cases you&#x27;ve learned something. The only difference is that failure creates more opportunities to learn again. If you&#x27;ve got a winning formula, you&#x27;re unlikely to change it, whereas if you fail and start again, you can then learn if your new formula is any better and repeat until you win.<p>One problem with this generalisation however, is that life isn&#x27;t just win or lose. It&#x27;s made up of many wins and many losses and it&#x27;s easy for one big win, or one big loss, to hide all of the other achievements. I&#x27;m sure SpaceX and PayPal have had more than their fair share of failures but their one big &quot;win&quot; (The ability to make money, although not yet in SpaceX&#x27;s case) is overlooked.",1372953856

5991240,comment,5990736,5990736,2,0,swalsh,,,"This whole thing feels wrong to me.  The market for education seems upside down.  Education is fastly becoming less about just getting a general education, and more as a step to achieving a career.  I think a very solid case can be made that a more educated workforce benefits industry as much if not more than it benefits the employees themselves.  I also think we&#x27;re missing out on the benefits of well placed pricing dynamics.<p>Today, most of the decisions are made by the students themselves.  By definition a student does not know anything about the future of the industry they&#x27;re entering other than possibly an article they read in a news paper.  What you end up getting are disproportionate classes of students in programs.  On the surface it sounds great.  In America I can go to school for whatever I want.  Of course when you graduate there&#x27;s only demand for 10% of the people in the program, and if you aren&#x27;t in the top 10% of people in your program IN THE COUNTRY, you&#x27;re not going to get a job in that industry anyways.  Plus you now have a boatload of debt, which you took on for essentially the privilege of knowing how to do work to benefit your future employer.<p>I think things would be improved with a few small changes.  Break up the private and public sectors into specific industry categories.  Create non profit organizations to help with predicting future demand, and curriculum, then have colleges bid on fulfilling it.  I think it does two things.  It allows for consistent standards to evolve (so if for-profit institutions bid, they have to prove they are providing a quality education... today they don&#x27;t for the most part) second I would assume these organizations would be better at negotiating then individual students would be, which I think would become a big deal as businesses are usually pretty smart at finding ways to pay less taxes... and if they&#x27;re paying 100% of the bill for education, they&#x27;re going to look out for bad pricing.",1372953821

As much as I appreciate the idea of everyone going to college, I think the idea of making loans easy for anyone to go to college has been a huge disservice to a lot of people.  Students don&#x27;t view the money as &quot;real&quot;, they simply view it as a free pass to go to the &quot;best&quot; (i.e. most expensive) college.  Universities know that students can get loans to cover their costs, so they raise the costs as fast as they can.  Also deserving some blame are parents who don&#x27;t spend enough time really working with their kids to remind them that a $50k/yr loan, WITH INTEREST, is going to be insanely hard to pay back.<p>But ultimately universities are going to raise tuition as high as they can because they know that students can get loans very, very easily.",1372953704

She&#x27;s nearing the end of grad school, and by all accounts is a successful physicist at the start of her career.  She&#x27;s worked very hard for four years to get there.  Miserable?  Isn&#x27;t this what she&#x27;s worked so hard to attain?<p>Turns out, she&#x27;s never wanted to be a physicist.  Her father coerced her into thinking she wanted to be.  And now he&#x27;s still pushing her to go into academia by pressuring her to get a PhD.  She says that getting a real job is all she&#x27;s dreamed about for years.<p>She&#x27;s one of the smartest people I know.  She&#x27;s a brilliant mathematician, far better than I could ever hope to be.  How could someone so smart end up with such a miserable life?<p>Because her parents decided that would be best, of course.

10952203,comment,10929592,10938367,0,0,mercer,,,"A small tip for those who use sass and use node-sass (and npm scripts):<p>I ran into a strange problem where if you use node-sass to watch a directory for some reason adding a new partial and the @import statements doesn&#x27;t quite work as it should. If you change something in the imported file, node-sass won&#x27;t recompile so you don&#x27;t see your changes. The only way around it is to re-save the file that does the @import, or restart the process.<p>The solution I found is to use the more generic &#x27;watch&#x27; package to watch the directory, and make it simply re-run node-sass without the watch flag. Aside from solving the problem, it also ended up feeling cleaner to use &#x27;watch&#x27; everywhere I needed it instead of relying on all the different watch approaches of the different tools.<p>The one downside is that certain tools&#x27; own watch capabilities are faster or do partial updates. In the few cases where that is true I would just use the built-in watch functionality of course. But it&#x27;s rarely been an issue for me.",1453463791

But I&#x27;ve been wondering about this: Until about 500 years ago, I guess China was ahead of Europe culturally, economically, scientifically etc, but then Europe raced ahead. How much does this have to do with the printing press? How easy is it to use a traditional printing press with Chinese characters compared to the Latin alphabet?<p>Obviously, access and spread of information must have a lot to do with a society&#x27;s development. Did the traditional printing press cause information (i.e. books and newspapers) to become cheap and widespread in Europe, but not in China?<p>Writing Chinese characters on a computer is relatively quick and easy. I wonder if this has something to do with the rapid development that we&#x27;re seeing in China now?<p>Some might say that embracing capitalism is why China is developing so fast now, and I guess that is partially true. However, wasn&#x27;t China kinda capitalist before the Communist revolution? It didn&#x27;t develop that much back then.<p>Edit: I found a bit of info on this on the Wikipedia page for the printing press. According to that &quot;a single Renaissance printing press could produce 3,600 pages per workday, compared to about 2,000 by typographic block-printing prevalent in East Asia&quot;.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press</a>",1453463635

For a small business situation something like Ruby may well be a better choice.<p>Java has a more powerful type system (though still poor by modern standards). Both have weaknesses regarding error handling - Go encourages you to err on the side of repetitive code, Java encourages you to err on the side of handling errors only at very high level, I&#x27;m not sure which is worse. Java has a much bigger ecosystem and better tool support, though a lot of it is written for pre-C10K days and assumes a &quot;1 thread per connection/request&quot; model - but frankly for a small business type situation that&#x27;s fine. The go concurrency model is overkill at the low end and not flexible enough at the high end, but if you&#x27;re in the sweet spot then you can write code more efficiently there than in Java.",1453463553

We could come up with a system of writing Mandarin sounds compactly using English characters, but I think there would still be too few sounds chasing too many ideas. When you see Chinese characters, meaning immediately appears in your mind. When you see the sounds of Mandarin words, I guess you start thinking about numerous possible meanings.<p>Totally concede that the writing system takes a lot of effort to learn. I think very few people other than the Chinese will ever learn to read it, much less write it.<p>On &quot;development&quot;, it wasn&#x27;t perfectly clear to me what the author meant. Honestly it never occurred to me they meant that the Chinese writing system was slowing the rise of the standard of living in China.

Up to that point it is read as true that everything the founder says will check out.<p>The due-diligence process is there for two reasons: to fulfill the &#x27;duty to research&#x27; for a VC to cover their backs in case a deal goes bad after investment and LPs wonder how the hell they got suckered in like that as well as to simply protect the funds.<p>For angels the situation is worse here because they don&#x27;t have the funds or the organization to do this properly.<p>> What about before?<p>Typically a VC has a number of analyists that assess the companies that pitch them to see how solid the various commercial claims are. The accent there is usually on the numbers and the commercial side of things, which is reflected in the education of the associates (typically: finance, accounting and/or a bit of legal and commercial).<p>Angels tend to do this part by themselves.<p>Angels and VCs do roughly the same thing, only angels do it earlier on (when the risk is higher, companies are cheaper and the deals are much smaller so they can still participate), the biggest difference is dictated by the size of the deals, it limits the amount of money you can spend in order to determine if you spend it wisely.<p>To make an extreme example: a full legal/commercial/technical/financial dd would cost approximately 100K or so. The bulk of that will be eaten up by the legal portion, the remainder is roughly equally split between the other parts.<p>If you&#x27;re looking to plunk down 100K as an angel <i>if</i> you actually did a full DD you&#x27;d be out 200K if the deal goes through or 100K if it doesn&#x27;t, so then there is no point in doing DD at all. Hence my advice to do an abbreviated one scaled down to a portion of the size of the investment, but to <i>definitely</i> look at all these aspects of the company, if possible through the eyes of an outsider.<p>The other important thing to remember is that doing DD puts a strain on the company you invest in, and if every angel would do a full DD on a company before investing then the company would grind to a halt during their seed round.<p>Yet another note: for seed investments there usually isn&#x27;t a whole lot to verify anyway, the company is still tiny, probably has no turnover (so financial dd becomes: look at the model), has very little technology (so tech becomes: look at the proof of concept) and so on. So everything becomes a lot simpler anyway, it wouldn&#x27;t be possible to do a full process DD on a start-up that has only just become real enough to look for seed funding.",1453462641

How much extra space would it really take to write out chinese, if it had it&#x27;s own phonetic script with a few dozen characters?

Human beings are actually quite good at learning complicated languages when we are young. We just naturally absorb them. There is no worry about languages being too complicated for it&#x27;s own speakers to learn.<p>But writing systems are learned later in life, and therefore take more effort and can lead to illiteracy.

I have absolutely no idea what to do! Compared to some of my classmate who start creating and cutting some beautiful images, I was starring in the air and didn&#x27;t know what to do. I try cut a few things but they all look so dull, ugly and meaningless in my mind.<p>After 30 mins of not going anywhere, my teacher came around and pat on my back, he said, &quot;Beauty is in the eye of beholder. It doesn&#x27;t really have to mean anything, it could just be some random cutting, some shape or even some words like your name. It doesn&#x27;t matter. Try your best&quot;<p>At that moment i really needed some encouragement, So i thought, since everyone were doing something good and fancy, why dont I cut out a Chinese word? He did said some words. Since i am the only Chinese in the class, surely no one would be doing it and no one would understand it anyway.<p>So in the remaining 15 min or so I drafted out the Chinese letter &quot;愛&quot;, ( meaning love ), it is complex enough and easy to explain.<p>In the end when everyone were presenting their work to our teacher, I still remember the look on his face when he saw mine, he was, awkwardly staring at it for 30 seconds, without making a single noise.

When we left the classroom, I turn around and my teacher was still standing there staring at my form &quot;art&quot;.  \nLater on that Week my teacher asked me privately to make him a few more of these Chinese Characters, I wrote out a few so he could choose, he was truly fascinated at the act form of these Characters.<p>I couldn&#x27;t grasp the idea then.

If you&#x27;re worth €50m, it&#x27;s just too expensive.<p>Given you already paid capital gains tax (or income tax) when you generated that wealth, there&#x27;s also the double taxation component. Wealth taxes (at least to me) seem like a great way to punish people who are doing well.<p>At the end of the day, we&#x27;re living in a globalised world, where borders matter less and less (at least in the west).",1453460477

Or people who believe there are easy answers because they are just unaware of the the complexities of the world and so maintain a simple, solvable, model of it in their minds? Or worse, people who  justify their views with the naturalistic fallacy and say, &quot;well, this is how the world works; we can&#x27;t change it so we might as well make the best of a shitty situation&quot;? (as long as they don&#x27;t get the short end of the stick, of course)<p>And you need to understand that people who write articles like that are being dismissive towards real people who have actually dedicated their lives to studying social problems (or debating questions of ethics).<p>> but have made zero attempt in educating him<p>Because the issue is very, very complex. I have provided a link that points to where to get started when approaching this difficult topic.<p>> if i was in a desert and somebody is really thirsty, why is it unethical for me to sell him some water?<p>The reason you&#x27;re bringing this up is because you think that the analogy is apt, but I&#x27;m not so sure. There are some ways to approach this (which are far from comprehensive).<p>First, you need to explain the situation. How much water do you have? Let&#x27;s suppose you have a supply for a million people. I would say that in that situation it may be ethical for you to sell that man some water, but if you do (rather than just give him the water), you now have a certain obligation towards him. For example, to make sure that he has enough water. Another question is why is that man in the desert in the first place? Could you have possibly contributed to his being there, or did not do enough to stop him? Suppose that the reason he is there is because he got lost, and he got lost because the map of the area is wrong. And it&#x27;s not just him, but many people get lost because of that map, and that is precisely why you&#x27;ve decided to get a water tanker and set up shop in the desert. Now, it may not have been in your power to change the map, but if you had made the same effort into getting the map fixed as into setting up your water stand, there may have been a good chance that it would have been fixed. So now this puts you in a different role: you&#x27;re not trying to help solve the desert problem, but you&#x27;re benefiting from it not being fixed, and while you may not have been able to fix it yourself, you could have helped but you didn&#x27;t. If that is the case, I think that you have quite a strong moral responsibility towards those poor souls. You are not to blame for their problem, you certainly didn&#x27;t make the desert or the wrong map, but you&#x27;re not really trying to fix the cause and you are benefiting from it. In that case, I would say that at the very least you have the moral responsibility to sell the water at a very decent price, and to make sure all your lost customers make it out alive.<p>My point is that mutually-beneficial exploitation has been known to be a very hard problem for a long time, and so we try to approach it on a case-by-case basis, and make sure we try to understand the full ethical picture. Simplified analogies don&#x27;t help -- they remove nuance from a very nuanced question.",1453460470

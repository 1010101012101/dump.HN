6828297,comment,6827077,6827864,2,0,parasubvert,,,"No one can realistically claim they truly understand the current system.  The Austrian economists seductively claim this, but that&#x27;s because they reject empiricism as a way of challenging their axioms.  Keynes seems to have hit upon the most predictive model we have for how economies operate at scale with currency, especially how we can get into depression-like circumstances when internet rates are 0% like they have been these past 5 years.  But we are still debating whether he was a genius, villain, or charlatan, because people refuse to look at the data and arguments with fresh eyes.<p>So what constitutes a &quot;hack&quot;, vs &quot;bug&quot;, vs &quot;works as designed&quot; is a matter for debate.  You point to the debt ceiling - that&#x27;s a non-economic political enomaly unique to the USA (and interestingly, iirc, Denmark).  It&#x27;s not so much a hack as a periodic configuration change.<p>You also mention inflation.  Currently there&#x27;s very little inflation anywhere in the world.  We are printing money everywhere, and yet there is no real inflation, not a peep, completely contrary to over 5 years of dire warnings from inflation hawks.  Why is that?  You&#x27;d think there may be a lesson here.<p>Southern Europe had massive capital inflows from the North during the past 10 years, leading to wage and price inflation.  Private excesses led to a massive crash in demand when the financial crisis hit, and a major outflow of capital.  So now the South is uncompetitive relative to their Northern neighbors.  The typical tool to get more competitive is to drop their exchange rates relative to their peers to bring export prices inline.  but with the Euro, they can&#x27;t do that.  So they&#x27;re stuck in a deflationary spiral - difficult (high unemployment, lowered workforce participation) and destructive (business and livelihoods destroyed and permananent damage to the country&#x27;s wealth generating capacity) considering prices and wages tend to be sticky downwards and thus don&#x27;t trend in a nice linear manner.<p>The above situation doesn&#x27;t occur quite as suddenly and badly in the USA among its member states because they have fiscal integration, which enables Federal transfers to poorer states to shore them up relative to their peers.  Decay and deflation still eventually happens if the underlying reason is structural (see the Detroit area).   But Southern Europe itself was a growth story, not a case of mismanagement but rather a victim of reckless investment with no EU system to soften the blow when there is a crisis.<p>As for the requirements on the money supply, there is plenty of history out there discussing the trouble with previous eras of the gold standard (see the Great Depression), or decentralized free money (the USA had hundreds of currencies in the 18th century- the civil war reparations was the onus to coalesce into a standard Federal reserve currency).<p>We have switched between predominantly commodity (deflationary) currency and debt-issuance (inflationary) currency for thousands of years.  There&#x27;s dangers on both sides.",1385920406

Wodehouse) isn&#x27;t being paid to be unconvinced by it. In his book he finds geometric errors (mismatches in the textures and folds of tablecloths and floors, for example) and depth of field artifacts <i>exactly</i> where you&#x27;d expect to find them if the painter were using optics to focus images onto a drawing canvas, and had to change focus as he moved out of focus planes.<p>He also points out that Caravaggio&#x27;s greatest paintings (among many examples) are a combination of astonishingly deft lighting and detail combined with gross errors that you&#x27;d get if (essentially) copying and pasting bits of photographs onto a canvas. (And, hey, I love Caravaggio...) The critics would have you believe that Caravaggio was a godlike draftsman who cold realistically paint the veins on people&#x27;s eyelids but couldn&#x27;t put their arms in the right position with respect to their bodies.<p>These guys invented (analog) Photoshop in the 17th century and it was one of their trade secrets. Apparently art critics find this insufficiently awesome, or the wrong kind of awesome. (Think: science awesome vs. romantic artiste awesome.)<p>Hockney also traces the passing of the secret technique by putting the works of various artists on an up-down (geographic) and left-right (time) chart and can show how two artists (one of whom had godlike drafting abilities and the other of whom was merely competent) crossed paths and then suddenly the lesser artist became godlike.<p>The argument that Hockney is just jealous of the talent of the old masters is equally ridiculous when he shows his own work with and without the techniques. One could level the charges that the art &quot;authorities&quot; that disbelieve him are simply jealous of their own utter lack of talent.<p>tl;dr -- most &quot;art experts&quot; are self-deluded idiots.

Tsunami victims on the other side of the world, a fund is set up to help them out, and most people might say, I&#x27;ll chip in a dollar, but I can&#x27;t be fucked to find out how, and sending a dollar is hard anyway.

It wasn&#x27;t until it actually happened that this clicked for me.<p>Consider telephone for example, initially it was used to talk to other people over a long distance, but it was thanks to that concept of sending information down a wire that made it possible today to eg. look at a live webcam on the other side of the world right now.<p>Imagine telling someone 200 years ago that you could talk/see a person on the other side of the world in real time.

Parliament regularly summons people, but the worst they will <i>do</i> to these people is ask them awkward questions and make stupid statements.<p>The destruction of harddrives was downright farcical and distasteful, but of relatively low importance: The Guardian were not forced to.<p>They were given hints that it might be bad not to destroy the drives. Even after pointing out that of course they had copies, and being given plenty of time to make further copies should they need to. So they decided to go along with it.<p>There were no thugs forcing their ways into their offices, nor any court orders forcing them to comply. They let some humourless GCHQ people into their offices voluntarily, and destroyed some harddrives everyone involved knew had been copied, and so everyone involved knew they were going through motions because the government officials had no powers to do more, but presumably had orders.<p>Cameron and ministers have complained loudly, but despite that they&#x27;ve so been totally impotent when it comes to actually <i>do</i> anoything more than inconveniencing Miranda at Heathrow for a few hours and arranging a voluntary ceremonial harddrive destruction that just made them look stupid.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not bad. I find it shocking and disgusting to see how politicians have responded to this. Cameron time and time again makes it clear that he has no respect for the public.<p>But if anything, it has also demonstrated that the UK government appears to only be able to respond to the publication of classified material in a way that is more perplexing and comical, in a way worthy of a Monthy Python sketch, than scary and intimidating.<p>I almost wish I had secret documents I could publish, so I too could get to experience first hand having GCHQ come to watch me pointlessly smash a harddrive (smashing a harddrive properly without powertools is <i>hard work</i> - I recently had to dispose of a bunch of drives at work...)",1385918800

Similarly there is disagreement over whether working for, say, the NSA would be ethical.

So then you won&#x27;t have to deal with pollution if you live close to one of the main arteries of that city.",1385917553

There is definitely a very photographic look to his work that is unlike that of most of his contemporaries. What I <i>am</i> disputing, however, is that they were merely used as a shortcut and that the use of these aids is the be all and end all of Vermeer&#x27;s talent. Even without his alleged use of photographic techniques Vermeer was a masterful painter: his handling of paint is otherworldly and that is something no photographic aid can help you with.<p>It&#x27;s also true that his work is much flatter than that of his contemporaries, but to my eyes there&#x27;s still a lot of 3D construction lurking behind those dazzling light effects that is completely missing in paintings that we know for sure have been made as copies of photographs. Like I said, to me Vermeer is a much better painter than the grandparent gives him credit for.",1385917438

In your case, решил probably (I don&#x27;t speak Russian) inherits the gender from пользователь.<p>My broader point is that in many languages, which Slavic ones are a subgroup of (but in German as well), there exists a construct that is used when you do not want to imply sex.

While we didn't have anything like the rotation that you mention, we were not expected to do research the first year I was in physics grad school, since we were all TA's.  That's in contrast to people I knew from the EE dept., who had to have an advisor picked out before they set foot on campus and were expected to start research the first day of school.<p>It's my understanding that in the biosciences, it's the norm for students to do rotations of a couple weeks in every group in the department to help them pick an advisor during their first semester/year.<p>And if picking and advisor is like picking your parents, your research topic is definitely like an arranged marriage.  You have to learn to love it...",1216200578

247454,comment,246626,247448,0,0,rms,,,"Well...   we've had this discussion before, but my attitude is that politics and economics will show up here because they don't violate the guidelines and I think it's great. You think that having articles about economics and politics (which do indeed generate conversation of lower quality than the rest of the site) will inevitably pollute the rest of the site and drive away users. Right now economics and politics stories are a small percentage of stories here and I find the negative response rather annoying. If they get to be too much, PG can change the guidelines or the voting mechanism.<p>I'll agree that the discussion in this thread is rather mediocre and is evidence of the phenomenon you are concerned about. But I've seen great discussions about politics and economics here and I like hearing it from the perspective of the users here. I've learned things and I just don't understand why you think we'll be better off not learning about these issues from each other. It reminds me too much of a generic rule for pleasant banal conversation, ""don't talk about religion or politics.""<p>We disagree about whether such discussion about things we are less knowledgeable is inevitably bad for the site. Ultimately the answer is unknown and I would like to see the limit pushed as far as possible to make the test of not degenerating into the lowest common denominator harder. I think it can be done, though downvoting stories may have to be enabled eventually.",1216199404

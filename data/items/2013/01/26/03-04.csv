I've praised his ability, skill, perseverance and talent that he possesses. And while your ""fuck this, I'm in the Matrix"" argument makes sense to a degree, Terrence Davis has PUBLICLY admitted that he is schizophrenic. Now, I don't know if he's either a really talented programmer/troll, or if he really is ill, or if he's just going through a phase. I don't know the guy. But many of his comments do make sense, and then lapse into nonsense gibberish. He does also display many signs of schizophrenia, such as disorganized, breaking speech, extreme ability to concentrate on a single, specific topic, and belief in an idol as a source of catharsis.<p>I doubt any person who took the time to write an OS for 10 full years would go to those extents to troll. When he's not talking nonsense, he seems like a logical and nice guy, honestly. My whole intention was to show how mentally ill people do not think the way normal people do, and highlight how it can negatively affect their life. This guy also had to leave his job on some unknown but probably intense terms.<p>And while you make a remark that I'm following the herd, the herd hates him. I do not. I have nothing against mad scientists; many have brought some very great things to society.<p>As a 14-year-old whose father is a physician with a degree in psychology, I HAVE asked him what the symptoms are. I HAVE showed him Davis' comments and videos. And my father believes it's very likely that Davis indeed has schizophrenia.<p>I have thought about this topic for hours at a time while I code (yes, I know, I have no life). I have reached a conclusion, and it is that Davis does have schizophrenia. Why would somebody sit home and code an OS for years, living off of disability instead of putting that talent to work in a traditional environment, especially when said person has a degree in computer science? Granted, there are crazy people in technology. Even Linus himself seems to be bipolar at times, but the fact of the matter remains that Davis is off the hook. Seriously off the hook.<p>(As for your open source comment, what I meant was less about hippies lining up outside of 1 Infinite Loop, but more about the virtues of FOSS itself and how its implications could have on society in general, thus, a ""revolution."")",1359172243
5119161,comment,5117356,5117356,4,0,pacomerh,,,"It's actually funny how the communities of developers get divided into groups. There's the know-everythings who are inclined to the technical side and  have a smart answer for anything and everything, all decisions are based on manuals and numbers. Also, creative ones who have some sort of background in something else other than development, like music or illustration, etc. They usually make things touching a bit on the side of art, therefore experimenting a bit more. In some cases these dudes will actually be very well versed on the technical side, but not all of the time. So, the interesting thing here to see how people appreciate websites in different forms.

Then I noticed, I'm donating to a 1 year old baby, with a cute photo.\nI really want to think of myself as someone who pays more attention, reads and makes a decision based on facts, medical condition, urgency, and likelihood to succeed, but no, I just clicked based on prejudice, 1 second first impression, biased decision, without noticing I did so.<p>Then I saw a 37 years old woman and noticed she got much less donations although her total needed amount is higher, perhaps her medical situation is less severe, but I would be naive to think that that's the only reason. So I asked myself, am I doing some sort of unconscious decision that is not really fair and unbiased? I would lie if I say I didn't.<p>So I donated 25$ to her as well, just so I feel a little better with myself, and then I thought, well, this is a feature request.<p>So to avoid the ""cute baby gets more donations"" bias, what would make it a little nicer to me is to donate without knowing who it goes to, I'd like a button that says - ""donate to most medically severe case"", or ""donate to most time sensitive case"" and have someone else make the decision. This will make me feel a little more in peace with myself, and actually might make such biases less common. \nRight now it might not have affect, but as it will hopefully grow to help more people, having such ""donate to who needs it most medically"" option will help prevent such gaps.<p>Also moving to a better payment system, Stripe or even Google checkout will make it a much nicer experience.<p>EDIT: the baby's profile was on the home page, where as the woman's profile was one click deeper, so this could be another reason, but this brings another enhancement, please automatically promote / rotate profiles that have less donations / most urgent medical conditions to the front page<p>Another feature I'm missing is to allow subscription, I would think many would be happy to donate 5$-20$ a month and  automatically give it to those who have the least donations, or must urgent medical condition. Getting traffic is hard and critical for making this work, and not every day you get to HN front page, I would take advantage of it and offer a recurring donation as soon as possible.",1359172127

5119115,comment,5110921,5118328,1,0,zmmmmm,,,"Hey, just want to say thanks for the great discussion again. I'm a bit humbled at the length & depth of thought you're putting into it.<p>> The problem with this approach is because figuring out where the files are requires knowledge of the tool inner workings, that can only be acquired from reading the code or documentation<p>I suppose this is true but it's really not an issue I have in practice. I run the pipeline and it produces (let's say) a .csv file as a result. I execute<p><pre><code>    ls -lt *.csv\n</code></pre>\nAnd I see my result at the top. There's really not a huge inconvenience in trying to find the output. Having the pipeline tool automatically name everything instead of me having to specify it is definitely a win in my case. I suspect we're using these tools in very different contexts and that's why we feel differently about this. It sounds like you need the output to be well defined (probably because there's some other automated process that then takes the files?) You <i>can</i> specify the output file exactly with Bpipe, it's just not something you generally <i>want</i> to do. There's nothing wrong with either one - right tool for the job always wins!<p>> if you use the same code in multiple steps, things can become quite confusing. How will BPipe name them<p>It just keeps appending the identifiers:<p><pre><code>   run { fix_names + fix_names + fix_names }\n</code></pre>\nwill produce input.fix_names.fix_names.fix_names.csv. So there's no problem with file names stepping on each other, and it'll even be clear from the name that the file got processed 3 times. One problem is you <i>do</i> end up with huge file names - by the time it gets though 10 stages it's not uncommon to have gigantic 200 character file names. But after getting used to that I actually like the explicitness of it.<p>> Imagine a step which takes 3 inputs - one separate, one which is output #2 of a previous step, and one which is output #6 of yet another step<p>Absolutely - you can get situations like this. We're sort of into the 20% of cases that need more advanced syntax (eventually we'll explore all of Bpipes's functions this way :-) ). But basically Bpipe gives you a query language that lets you ""glob"" the results of the pipeline output tree (not the files in the directory) to find input files. So to get files from specific stages you could write:<p><pre><code>    from("".xls"", "".fix_names.csv"", "".extract_evergreens.csv"") {\n        exec ""combine_stuff.py $input.xls $input1.csv $input2.csv""\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIt doesn't solve <i>everything</i>, but I guess the idea is, make it work right for the majority of cases (""sensible defaults"") and then offer ways to deal with harder cases (""make simple things easy, hard things possible""). And when you really get in trouble it's actually groovy code so you can write any programmatic logic you like to find and figure out the inputs if you really need to.<p>> Instead of naming hundreds of files, you have to name hundreds of methods (commands)<p>Not at all - if my pipeline has 15 stages then I have 15 commands to name. Those 15 stages might easily create hundreds of outputs though.<p>> The major difference is that we think you need to identify inputs and outputs to build the graph, and the method name is insignificant until you want code re-use, and BPipe seems to take the opposite position - that you need to give method names, and then use a separate expression to build the graph<p>Again, a really insightful comment, but I'd take it further (and this goes back to my very first comment). Bpipe isn't just not trying to build a graph up front, it really doesn't think there is a graph at all! At least, not an interesting one. The ""graph"" is a <i>runtime product of the pipeline's execution</i>. We don't actually know the graph until the pipeline finished. An individual pipeline stage can use if / then logic <i>at runtime</i> to decide whether to use a certain input or a different input and that will change the dependency graph. You have to go back and ask why you care about having the graph up front in the first place, and in fact it turns out you can get nearly everything you want without it. By not having the graph you lose some ability to do static analysis on the pipeline, but to <i>have</i> it you are giving up dynamic flexibility. So that's a tradeoff Bpipe makes (and there <i>are</i> downsides, it's just in the context where Bpipe shines the tradeoff is worth it).<p>>  In the example you provided you identify different outputs by adding a number to their names. Is that how subsequent steps are supposed to refer to them as inputs - by the positional output number from the step that used to generate them<p>I think the ""from"" example above probably illustrates it. The simplest method is positional, but it doesn't have to be, you can filter with glob style matching to get inputs as well so if you need to pick out one then you just do so.<p>> 1) As far as different philosophies go, I find BPipe's one to be a bit problematic for complicated cases.<p>I can't argue with that - but that's sort of the idea: simple things easy, hard things possible. Complicated cases are complicated with every tool. I guess I would say that pipeline tools live at a level of abstraction where they aren't meant to get <i>that</i> complicated.<p>> 2) And for simple cases, it all comes down to syntactic sugar.<p>I guess I'd have to disagree with this, as I really think there are some fundamental differences in approach that go well beyond syntactic sugar.<p>> Give me an example of a BPipe workflow that you particularly like, and I'll put it in Drake<p>I wouldn't mind doing that - I'll need to look around and find an example I can share that would make sense (what I do is very domain specific - unless you have familiarity with bioinformatics it will probably be very hard to understand). I'll pm you when I manage to do this, but it may take me a little while (apologies).<p>Thanks as always for the interesting discussion. I think this is a fascinating space, not least because there have been <i>so many</i> attempts at it - I would say there are probably dozens of tools like this going back over 20 years or so - and it seems like nobody has ever nailed it. Bpipe has  problems, but so does every tool I've ever tried (I'm probably up to my 8th one or so now!).",1359171211

Our partners already collect patient info (and sometimes even photos) for patient medical records, so requesting they send us that info isn't a big ask.<p>2) We leverage technology to ensure we can efficiently process and allocate donations.

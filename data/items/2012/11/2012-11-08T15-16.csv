It works very well in practice. rbenv handles the correct ruby version, Bundler loads the right gem, and it all falls back to the newest version on the system default ruby.<p>It's a few more moving parts behind the scenes than I'd prefer, but once configured it's completely transparent.",1352390375

Economics is a pretty vague sort of thing that straddles the line between  between the humanities and hard science. As a former economics student, I can tell you I've met very brilliant people who have adamantly disagree with one another, yet both have excellent insights. It's tough to definitely say that x plan is better than y plan, because there are so many what if scenarios and assumptions to rely on. That being said, I find it's generally better to trust whoever has articulated their plan better.

At the moment that commend was made (2 years ago, btw), GNOME was toying with the idea of replacing status icons with persistent notifications, while Ubuntu was pushing the use of application indicators (which was the first huge division between the codebases).<p>Indicators (which are menus created though a DBus interface) simply have no place in the gnome-shell, so the library was not merged into Gtk3 (the reasoning was that only things common to all consumers belong there). Transmission uses indicators when available but falls back to using status icons when not available.

What about rbenv constitutes the ""proper way"" versus a tool like RVM? If the argument is that RVM abstracts away too much of the underpinnings, then you've just a made a philosophical argument that is in conflict with much of the work that we do as developers.<p>RVM is simply an environment manager. One should always understand the environment that they're managing, but using tools to increase the efficiency of that management is not in violation of the ""proper way"". If abstraction of underlying complexity is bad, we shouldn't be using bundler, rbenv, or even init scripts and package managers. We should start all system processes with the direct invocation and build and install software by hand, lest we not learn the ""proper way"".<p>If we accept that abstraction is not necessarily a bad thing, then we can recognize that there's nothing about rbenv that is any more ""proper"" than RVM, and we can all use the tools we prefer.<p>I prefer not to have to append '--path=./somedir' every time I run `bundle install`.<p>I prefer not to have to prepend 'bundle exec' to every shell tool in my toolchain.<p>I prefer to have all my rubies and gemsets organized in a single location instead of spread out across my projects.<p>I understand that by using RVM a background process is altering my environment.

I only ask, because I've tried both and far prefer Udacity for several reasons. 1. It let's me be sloppy. As long as I end up at the right conclusion it lets me advance forward, but still shows me the ""best"" way to do it. 2. With code academy, I feel more like it's simple rote memorization where Udacity makes me think more.

I think the Galaxy S series by Samsung have much more hype than Nexus (at least between ""real"" people that is not obsessed with gadgets), and I am pretty sure that the Nexus 4 will not sell as much phones as the S3.<p>There is a lot of controversy on the reviews because it lacks LTE. Apart from that, the only thing that this phone have that is not found in many other Android devices is the glass back. The HTC One X (lacks non-removable battery, no SD card slot) and the GNexus (no SD card slot) are famous devices that have this problems.<p>My point is that the ""beauty"" of the Android ecosystem is that you can choose between a lot of different designs and specs. The Nexus 4 have glass back, no LTE, no sd card slot and non-removable battery. Will it be more popular than the S3, that don't have any of this ""problems""? I don't think so.<p>I am buying the Nexus 4 because I love the design, I love stock Android and there is no LTE in my country yet.

For example, I had one client with a set of content aggregators (read: web crawlers) that grew and shrunk dynamically with no centralized logging. When I eventually convinced them it was worth the time, I fixed a variety of their logging issues and also introduced statsd and graphite.<p>Implementation was easy. statsd is pretty simple to deploy and graphite wasn't too difficult either. To add statsd reporting to your code, it's essentially one line to create the statsd socket, another line of code to declare each timer or counter, and another one to increment. I think more time was spent determining what name to give each metric than it was implementing it in this project.<p>Now that I'm at dotCloud, I'm working with a much larger distributed system and we use it here also. We liked it enough to build some statsd hooks onto our RPC layer we use for just about everything. Now every time a component makes a remote procedure call, a counter for that call is incremented and the response time is sent to statsd. It's been very useful for troubleshooting odd behaviors and correlating events across the platform.<p>As people who work with complex distributed systems, we can't know <i>exactly</i> what they're doing. We'll think we know, and sometimes we'll be close. Other times we'll think we know, and then we'll wake up at 2AM because something failed horribly. By being able to monitor the system's behavior (sometimes in gross detail), we can get a little closer to knowing what's really going on.",1352388485

I definitely appreciate the extensive quoting of Gnome and Ubuntu people, though, which is not too common in these kinds of articles.<p>The thing is, Gnome is focused on an idea of ""user experience."" What's implicit in this pursuit is their mental model of the user. Who is Gnome for? Well, if you're reading HN, it's probably not for you. They're making it pretty clear that if you're an old school linux person, if you like customization ability, if you like options, then you're not the user they have in mind. For those of us who are not ""the users they're looking for,"" we have to be ok with that, accept that's what they want to do, and make our choice accordingly: we can suck it up and use it anyway, we can use something else, or we can fork Gnome.<p>At the same time, I suspect that they don't really know what they're doing, and the ""user"" in their ""user experience"" is largely illusory; the product of the imagination of a few Gnome designers. They seem prepared to double down on this concept though - I think this is the only explanation possible of their arrogance in the face of widespread denunciation from almost every corner of the traditional linux community, including typically scathing flames from Linus. The Gnome people seem to feed on this negativity, like it's validation of their plans. ""It is not for you, it is for 'them'"" - whoever ""they"" are.<p>I wonder if their concept of who they're targeting as users couldn't be boiled down to a fairly basic distinction: traditional linux stuff is for people who enjoy using computers, and Gnome is designed for people who don't. Or put another way: people who use computers, versus people used by computers - the latter group belonging to a sort of corporate mindset.<p>Regardless, this mindset is being taken to far in its application to GTK, which for a large number of reasons should not be taken as simply another part of Gnome. It leads to almost a Kubuki Theater situation in which Gnome devs try to push around apps like transmission, which merely uses GTK, to fit into their Gnome user paradigm, while pretending nothing else exists.

That's kind of the feeling I get when using rbenv + bundler.<p>Let me predicate this by pointing out that I manage a lot of Ruby projects (many are old) that require a wide variety of Ruby and gem versions. Obviously my solution isn't the best for everyone. Some developers will never have to worry about conflicting gem versions, because they work primarily on one project with one set of dependencies. The incremental value of the items I'm about to point out don't represent significant value to them. Enough with the disclaimers.<p>Bundler has the ability to alter your Ruby env variables so that you can easily install and execute gems from any location. This is the feature that allows you to use completely different gems across many projects without any conflicts. As the author suggests, you can pass a path at the time you invoke `bundle install` as a means to specify this location. This allows you to segregate gems to avoid conflicts. The author also points out that the trade-off is ""one annoying side effect: any binaries that are installed (e.g. rspec, foreman, cap) are no longer available in your shells path"". Bummer. I wonder if there's a way around that? Hey, we could manage our environment so that these items are in our path, but remain segregated. We could even write some tidy scripts that automate it for us. Enter RVM.<p>This is why I don't understand the drive to move to rbenv for developers who need these features. I use RVM <i>and</i> bundler all the time. RVM doesn't preclude the use of bundler, and bundler doesn't make RVM obsolete. When I establish an RVM gemset and .rvmrc, I've abstracted away all the '--path=./.somebundledir' and `bundle exec` nonsense. I only think about it once, then I'm free to use the tools without additional cruft. I'm probably happier than I should be that I can type `cap staging deploy:pending` instead of `bundle exec cap staging deploy:pending`.<p>If you don't need gemsets, or you're only managing a very small number of Ruby projects, I suppose I can understand wanting a simpler tool, but I don't find RVM terribly complex. A lot of people will say ""choice is good"", but principle applied without cause isn't good, it's just pedantic.",1352388264

And I think most of us are sick of gridlock in Washington and can see through the political BS (for example, all the posturing during the last round of federal budgeting).  The older registered Republicans I've talked with over the last couple of years have told me they can see that Obama has been trying to work with Republican politicians, and it's not his fault things aren't getting done.

That's not a big concern for many applications, but if you're doing embedded software or real-time systems it can be a deal breaker.<p>So in this example, is C++ better or worse than Java? The answer is that it depends what problem you're trying to solve, what environment you're running in, and what resources you have available on your development team. Personal preference matters too in terms of programmer satisfaction, but just because you like one language's constructs more than another doesn't mean it's well suited to every problem space.<p>As to the original article, I think it's great to learn about how different companies change their software stack, but not because ""w00t Twitter hates Ruby - Java rocks""; rather it's interesting to see how business context changes over time and the implications that has on the technology. Seeing how other businesses have dealt with these hurdles can help you keep an eye out for them in your own business. I just wish that this was the lens that it was written in rather than ""OMG - Ruby = Fail Whale.""<p>If you're a language designer then it's good to hear about the complaints and preferences of programmers so that you can design a better language (and thus a better tool).

So people that bought durable flatware that they never think about are induced to compare it to flatware that is presented as being The Best (even though the author would likely not spend time or energy trying to convince them they made the wrong choice).<p>This sort of minimalism is also quite post-materialistic, in that it depends on materialism (for example, a materialistic society is a pretty great way to end up with dozens of types of flatware to choose from).",1352386916

Well, I can see why you'd be concerned about pissing people on HN off.<p>However, if there were no advertising anywhere, how would we know what products to buy ? Mainstream advertising channels make users extremely susceptible to 'banner blindness', 'channel flipping', etc.<p>Of course, the more sensitive users on HN would question your motivations. It's because advertising is becoming so insidious these days that you can never be sure whether an 'expert' is just talking out of his hat or actually giving 'expert advice'.<p>In this case, since your product is yourself, I'd still give you the benefit of the doubt. Anyone getting annoyed at that needs to think about what's being sold and why :)<p>I don't know how it's elsewhere but in India lawyers and chartered accountants aren't allowed to advertise their services. They can have only a small board (very discreet) outside their workplace saying who they are and what they do. I wonder if programmers are ever going to go the same way :O",1352386814

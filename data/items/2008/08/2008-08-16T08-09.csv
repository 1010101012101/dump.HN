It's ""Rules for Radicals"" by Saul Alinsky. Alinsky is a famous leftist, but he was also a South Side community organizer in Chicago, 15 years before Obama was.<p>The book is unabashedly leftist in ways that are almost quaint, but it's also front-to-back pragmatic and filled with advice. It's my favorite marketing book ever.",1218876724

Possibly safer as a result of that as well.",1218876196

* go to one of a billion music playing websites
* Search for the track you want
* Click play<p>It depends what you mean by DVD. If you're talking about a physical DVD, then obviously no you can't. If you mean play the movie/tv show, then yes obviously you can.",1218876100

277646,comment,277269,277554,0,0,silencio,,,"I was waiting on the front lawn for a UPS delivery to show up while surfing on my laptop one day since it was a nice day. I occasionally took a look at the online tracking page and flipped out when it went from ""out for delivery"" to a failed delivery notice because the recipient wasn't there. Since I saw no UPS truck driving past my house, and the front door is the only way to make a delivery short of climbing over walls of other houses, you can probably understand why. Called up UPS customer support, asked them to please redeliver the next day because I would be leaving home soon and I didn't want to wait for the delivery, wherever the guy was, so he could save himself some time and effort.<p>The UPS delivery guy actually came over 4 hours later when I was definitely away from home to put up a delivery attempt notice saying I wasn't there. After I explicitly told two separate customer support folks NOT to deliver the package after I talked to them because I will not be there to pick up - and those two were separate from the initial call I made. This guy seemed to have an absurd sense of humor, because he marked the one and only notice I received that I didn't want as a second delivery attempt.<p>Your idea will only make sense if UPS actually did their job. They failed catastrophically for me in that incident. Since I seem to get delivery attempt notices quite often, I wonder just how many times they actually stopped by (unfortunately I usually take the car out when I'm going, and that's a different exit..).",1218875930

277644,comment,277600,277625,0,0,gaika,,,"I use Thrift and it is underhyped. I looked at Cassandra, and it offers more than HBase with a lot cleaner and smaller codebase. That's not just NIH, that's some really important thing happening here: standard tools like relational databases do not work for companies like google or facebook. Suddenly to process these volumes of data you do not have to worry about the back-end. That lets small startups compete on the same terms with big guys.<p>For example JS-Kit.com generates 10G-100G worth of data a day. They had to create an equivalent of Amazon's Dynamo to handle it. Easily half of their resources are dedicated to maintaining and extending this infrastructure. Now imagine if they could just use Cassandra and focus on their core? I do not know what Disqus or FriendFeed are using (probably mysql?), but they can benefit from it too once they grow.<p>That could affect Google too, there will be more competition from smaller startups like webmynd or cuil because of it. And if startups adopt Facebook's tools instead of Google's, that would make them less attractive to Google as an acquisition target.",1218875278

For example:<p>- you cannot determine if the user that just made a sale today by coming directly to your website is the same user that saw your Google Ads 3 days ago and clicked on it. You have no idea if paying 1 USD per click is worthy since you can no longer track that 1-to-10 conversion rate for your $20 product.<p>- you cannot determine in A/B user testing if the increased metrics are for the users seeing the homepage layout for the first time or for the users that are at a returning visit.<p>- you cannot get visibility into your acquisition costs (except for users buying something or logging in on their first visit) which prevents you from increasing budget on good-performing marketing channels and killing the rest, which in turns prevents you from scaling your business (while your competitors have free reigns in doing so).",1299679054

2304808,story,,,6,4,JohnTitus,"Show HN: Graffitly - Anonymous Public Messages",,"Hi HN,
About two months ago, I was inspired by the events that began to unfold in Tunisia, Egypt, and then elsewhere, as everyday people started using the internet to organize revolutions against despots.  I was amazed at their courage, using sites like Facebook which forces them to use their real name, or twitter which uses an account that can be easily tracked back to them.  I thought that if there was a way they could use a site to communicate with a large audience, anonymously, they might be a bit safer.<p>Graffitly is my attempt at that site.  It's my first ruby on rails app, and there is still a bunch left to do (and redo).  While it doesn't offer true anonymity on the internet, it would make it much harder for someone to figure out who posted and sent a message.  I've been very encouraged by the fact that the vast majority of messages are coming from outside the US.  I'd really like to get some feedback from this community, especially about:<p>- Should I focus on improving the ""anonymousness"" of the site, by removing all the 3rd part features (like Disqus) that put a cookie on the users's computer - or move the site more towards a fmylife.com-type site where anonymity isn't really important, but spreading the word to a vast audience is?<p>- I'm not great at design, I know this, and would appreciate any helpful tips.",1299679000
2304807,comment,2304341,2304341,0,0,Facens,,,"The article does NOT describe the situation. The situation is different and is explained by this part of the Directive:
""This shall not prevent any technical storage or access for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications network, or as strictly necessary in order for the provider of an information society service explicitly requested by the subscriber or user to provide the service""
And by the further comments to the text, clearly reducing the so claimed 'stupidity'.<p>Pascal Van Hecke wrote a useful comment explaining the situation and clearing the misunderstandings.

From his tone it doesn't appear this blogger has done so..<p>Here's the specific piece of text that covers this new legislation:<p><i>Third parties may wish to store information on the equip­ment  of a user, or gain  access to information  already stored, for a number of purposes, ranging from the legiti­mate (such as certain types of cookies) to those involving unwarranted intrusion into the private sphere (such as spy­ware or  viruses). It is therefore of paramount importance that users be provided with clear and comprehensive infor­mation when engaging in any  activity which could result in such storage or gaining of access. The methods of pro­viding information and offering the right to refuse should be as user-friendly as possible. Exceptions to the obligation to provide information and offer the right to refuse should be limited to those situations where the technical  storage or access is strictly necessary for the legitimate purpose of enabling the use of a specific service explicitly requested by the subscriber or user. Where it is technically possible and effective,  in accordance  with the relevant  provisions  of Directive 95/46/EC, the user’s consent to processing may be expressed by using the appropriate settings of a browser or other application. The enforcement of these require­ments should be made more effective by way of enhanced powers granted to the relevant national authorities</i><p>There is a very clear exception in there when the service is <i>explicitly requested by 
the subscriber or user</i>; so that covers login cookies, perference cookies etc.<p>It also talks about making the process user friendly; so popup boxes don't seem to comply with that specific suggestion (ironically meaning that the attempt here to stick to ""the letter of the law"" actually goes dead against it :P).<p>My feeling here is ""meh"", this doesn't strike me as an attempt to deal a crushing blow to the use of cookies. It looks to me like some specific piece of legislation that can be used to hit the more evil users of tracking cookies and those circumventing the ""I don't want any cookies pls"" settings of browsers (i.e. Flash Cookies). A piece that has been badly worded.<p>On the other hand it <i>does</i> seem to cover the use of 3rd party analytics software that use tracking cookies. Which is unfortunate and potentially a problem in places like Germany where the lawyers will just love to make merry hell with such legislation :) (privacy laws are a favourite of their legal eagles for some reason!).<p>Either way; they really need to iron out the ambiguity just to stop this firestorm of moaning.<p>But at this stage, as an EU based web host/developer etc, my state of being is ""not worried yet"".",1299678930

2304774,comment,2303927,2304639,0,0,mansr,,,"That is a misunderstanding.  All reasonably performing filesystems lose data if you pull the plug.  The difference with XFS is that it buffers writes more aggressively than e.g. ext3, so the amount of lost data may be greater.  Properly written apps fsync() any precious data anyway, so this is not an issue.<p>The notion that XFS is unreliable probably stems from the way such lost buffered data has historically been handled.  Because XFS allocates the space ahead of actually writing the data, files with unwritten data at a reset could have visible zero-filled blocks after recovery whereas ext3 would simply truncate them.  In both cases the data was lost.<p>Since a while back, unwritten extents like these are detected and trimmed back, so now XFS behaves more like most other filesystems.  There are still more buffered writes floating about, of course, so the same precautions are still required.",1299678121

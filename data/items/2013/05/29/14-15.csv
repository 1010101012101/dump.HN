The second being that the government didn't have the technical or legal ability to stop them. Either way it does not paint the government in a good light.<p>Due process protections in the US generally mean that there tends to be a gap between ""government has a pretty good idea that something illegal is being done and a fairly specific idea of what it is"" and ""government has its ducks in a row regarding proof that will stand up in court to begin legal action with a reasonable probability of success"".<p>I actually think this is the core of one of the <i>best</i> features of our government, so I don't think it paints the government in a bad light at all that it often knows about bad things happening considerably sooner that it has the practical legal ability to stop them (or, at least, before exercising that ability will jeopardize the ability to hold wrongdoers accountable under the law.)",1369839343

More like basic training prep, which was physically pretty easy after proper preparation (other than the sleep deprivation).<p>Not unusual at all for the biggest bully to be kinda wimpy compared to even an average kid, I think there's a bit of a compensation reaction.<p>I will admit the ""helped not be bullied"" bit IS true solely WRT my point of diversity although I think you have the reaction mechanism wrong.  I did not hang out with the football players much but we did commiserate about leg days (everyone hates leg days, lets just say the soreness the day after is probably the most painful thing anyone intentionally does as an inherent part of any sport) and I did not hang out with the mountain biker kids but we could talk about favorite trails and stuff.  I don't think it matters that I was big-ish, even as a scrawny little long distance runner I could have at least talked with track and field kids about blisters or something even if I never joined the track and field team.  The point being that it gave me the diversity to communicate with kids other than my classmates who took calculus and ""intro to o-chem"" their senior year.  In retrospect, solely looking at bullying oriented outcome it probably is a heck of a lot easier to listen to some heavy metal than to doing squats in the weight room, for the identical quantity ""X"" of not being bullied, if that makes any sense.  The other problem with weightlifting is it leads to ... enhanced caloric intake, which becomes a problem later on in life if you drift away from lifting but continue to eat entire roasted (small) chickens in one sitting, for example.

I can even provide an example.<p>My older daughter has problems with math. She doesn't like it and doesn't want to do it. Therefore, most of the problems she has with it I relate to her more than her teacher. I view it as a problem for both us as parents and her teacher to figure out ways to motivate her to try harder and to discover what problems she may have that we can work on.<p>On the other hand, she's a really good reader. She loves to read books and often does so without any outside motivation. When we moved to our current school district my daughter was tested for reading on a computer using software she had never seen before and was rated as a poor reader. We disagreed with this result and told the teacher that likely the problem lay with the system that she had never seen before. In her previous year in another school and at home she's a self-motivated reader that is slightly above average for her age group. The teacher stuck with the results and placed her in a lower reading group, where she quickly outpaced the other students in the group. Thankfully, after a few months, she was moved up into an appropriate group for her reading level. In that case I fully fault the teacher in that because she went with an automated system telling her what to do, didn't do an informal test of her own, and ignored her parents on the matter. Later the teacher even suggested that the sudden and large improvement in her reading was due to their reading programs at the school. The conspiracy theory part of me thinks it was intentional so that her reading scores would show a huge improvement through the school year.<p>You do have to keep that cartoon in mind as a general kind of thing because otherwise it suggests that there is no such thing as a bad teacher.",1369838326

I've saved many hours of development time by starting with it as a base, and would recommend it to anyone writing Rails-based SAAS.<p>It has a few wrinkles though, mainly from being actively developed in 2008, with mainly bugfixes and Rails 3 support coming since then.  The main ones I'd highlight that tripped me up:<p>- Expects payment gateway authentication credentials to be stored in a YAML file in source control instead of loaded from the environment.<p>- A number of the controller actions trigger immediate email sending, which can cause customer-visible 500 errors if the email sending fails and is a less reliable way of making sure the email gets sent.<p>- Use Stripe API v1 instead of the current v2.<p>- A lot of the customer email templates are kind of boilerplate-y and would not win the Patrick McKenzie stamp of copywriting approval. I believe they're loaded in from the gem rather than from the app.<p>My main piece of advice would be to vendor the entire gem right off the bat -- you're likely going to be tweaking several different parts of it, and there's almost no active development that you'd have to incorporate.",1369838065

This is hard problem because there are too many big companies with lots of money and very interesting place and projects to work at who are also after these so-called superstar developers. So in that regard Yahoo is the least interesting place to work at. What can Yahoo do?<p>- They can offer high wage, but its not always about the money. So it is unlikely that they will get many good developers like that.<p>- They can make yahoo relevant and interesting place to work again but acquiring new projects, developing new projects and improving existing projects. I believe Yahoo is doing that right now. It takes time for public perception to change, but I think they are doing a good job.<p>- Acui-hires is the easiest way to get good developers under yahoo roof and thats exactly what they are doing.<p>So I don't think they are competing with google, but instead they are trying to get their base in order and clean up their existing products.

Even after reading the follow-up report submitted to open this thread, I'm not at all sure that Dryden was trying to undermine the survey process. Here's a key passage from the middle of the story submitted here:<p>""Dryden, a social studies teacher, told three of his classes that they had a Fifth Amendment right to not incriminate themselves when they took a social-emotional learning survey April 18. Some of the 34 questions asked students about their drug and alcohol use, as well as about their emotions. Their names were on the surveys, as it was intended to identify students who could use help, according to school district officials. Those whose answers raised red flags were called in to the school's student services workers, including social workers and counselors.<p>""Barshinger said there was no Fifth Amendment issue, for several reasons. Once students' names were on them, he said, they would have become student records and subject to student privacy laws. And students cannot incriminate themselves because, even if the district shared the information with police, police can't prosecute based on that, he said. They are only allowed to arrest students if they are harming other students, such as in a fight, or if the student is in possession of drugs or alcohol, Barshinger said.<p>""Board president Cathy Dremel, speaking on behalf of the board, said Dryden 'mischaracterized' the efforts of fellow teachers and administrators, some of who had worked on a committee for a year to find a survey instrument that would assess students' risky behavior.<p>""'The board will not support any employees giving students false impressions about those who come here every day' to work for their best interests, she said.""<p>I am a lawyer by training. I don't actively practice law currently, but I stay alert to the law related to K-12 education, which was my motivation for studying law. In my experience, school district officials are often VERY BADLY advised on what the law is, and their default assumption is that they can do what they want, and hide what they are trying to do from parents who have the actual legal authority to guide their children's educations. I wouldn't take these kinds of statement from the district superintendent or from the school board president as the last word on what the legal consequences of the student survey might be.<p>I think another Hacker News participant said in the earlier thread that he lives in the district and would report on what he observed at the school board meeting about the survey. I'm not completely sure that this latest news story, which fills in more details that weren't reported in the first story, settles the issue of whether or not teacher Dryden's behavior was appropriate under the circumstances.",1369836425

So often I see people go off on the weekend to code a replacement for a legacy system, come back with a good demo, but not realize that they did 2.5% of the work that was responsible for 25% of the functionality.</i><p>Well, I've done it.  I've developed complete solutions to business problems that the company was trying to solve.  I did it without waiting for permission or for my design to be approved, and I did it only after I fully researched and understood the problem space and the future goals of the company.  Then I made sure the design took into account all of those future contingencies without being rigorously bound by them, i.e. flexible and not a hindrance when the business goals change in the future -- which they always do.  At the most recent company I worked for (a massive corporation) the system is expected to be in production for the next 3 years at a minimum.  I did the first 90% of the work in two months, then the other 90% of the work in another month or so.  The fourth month was spent primarily on training, documentation, and meetings.<p>Competence exists.  The managers are simply given the authority to squander it or to perceive it as a threat and fire them.  I was lucky enough to have a manager who was receptive to me overstepping my bounds as a contractor.  I made decisions (such as making Redis a core requirement of my design) before asking permission or waiting for approval.  I presented a demo of an early version of it to my manager at the end of my first week, and thankfully he was both surprised and happy about it.  (40x improvements to the existing infrastructure tend to elicit that reaction.) But most large corporations, and even many small ones, aren't like that at all.  You'd be fired for overstepping your boundaries, whether or not you were capable of making a difference to the bottom line.  It's up to the manager, and that is a wholly backwards way of running a modern software corporation.<p>For software companies, there has got to be a better way than the existing approach.  At the very least, the concept of a ""manager"" should be divided into two people:  a manager and a producer.  The producer's role is to drive their project's goals.  The manager's role is to ensure that the employees are happy and to deal with roadblocks (such as if an employee needs to purchase a third-party tool).  The manager has the authority to fire people; the producer does not.  The manager's goal is to <i>look after the team</i>, not the project.  And neither of them can tell an employee what to do.  The employees are given tasks to complete, not steps to complete, and then trusted to complete that task.  The employee is trusted not to accept tasks which he/she feels are too ambitious for the producer's timeline.  So the producer can only barter with the employees, not demand from them.<p>I know of a massive videogame company (not Valve) which operates that way, and it's the reason they're currently the industry leader in their genre even though they've grown exponentially as a company over the past four years, both in employee count and customer count.  So it absolutely worked for them, and I'm willing to bet that it would work in a lot of software companies.  I want to prove that it works.",1369836388

In fact, it might make it even worse.<p>Look at it this way: his basic argument is that humanity's most valuable asset is ideas. The more good ideas we have, the better. And the best way to spread ideas is replication--people learn them from other people.

They spread naturally, because people are not fools. If you have a good idea, <i>use</i> it.

It really is very important to be allowed to remind students of those situations where they don't _have_ to obey.<p>I think that the legal considerations here are a distraction. I think (and I am assuming here) that the teachers actions were largely driven by his conscience. And the simple fact that arguments about this tend to circle around debates over the constitution, and other legalities, make me more worried about the United States than anything else.",1369836159

What is OP supposed to do to ""save"" the project?</i><p>I would disagree there.<p>A <i>good</i> manager might take the situation well - they may have been misinformed by others and think things are far better than they are.<p>If that isn't the case there may be the option of going above the managers head, though this has to be considered <i>very</i> carefully. In may case once it went rather well: the person above me had grossly misreported things above him. We are still dealing with some of the legacy of that period, but getting through it (and that person is no longer here). Of course depending on local politics this could go very badly, so I'll repeat: consider this sort of action very very carefully before taking the step.<p>In my case saying ""things have been X bad for a while, if things don't change either we are going to fail badly very soon or I'm going to burn out inside a couple of months"" got the message across (it turns out an honest assessment was appreciated and that not losing some of us through walk out or burn out was important enough to warrant rearranging some plans and expectations). Of course I'm lucky: the Powers That Be here are sensible and  I've been here over a decade & proven myself a good few times over so my word carries some weight - a relative new-starter under a less receptive hierarchy would not fair so well.<p>If there really are no options for plan A for whatever reason, no end of time/overtime will fix the problem and there is no way the management can be made to appreciate the scale of the problem, that leaves plan B: get ready to jump ship.",1369836098

8347775,comment,8347315,8347660,4,0,agwa,,,"Sites with minimal or no JavaScript are faster than sites with lots of JavaScript.  The volume of JS is often so large, especially with frameworks, that it can take a long time both to transfer and to execute.  I&#x27;ve noticed the difference to be significant on older computers or slower Internet connections, but it&#x27;s even perceptible on new systems with fast Internet connections.  Studies repeatedly show that ordinary users care about the speed of websites.  I think this is a very good reason to shy away from making a &quot;full client-side application&quot; unless the benefits from that approach are significant.",1411322345

8347773,comment,8347163,8347394,2,0,egwor,,,"I think that people often miss why people go to doctors in the first place and why they trust them. In society a doctor was historically always a very well respected individual. I think it&#x27;s worth reflecting on that. Why were they respected? Did it help the patient that they were respected?<p>Considering the impact of placebo medicines, I can&#x27;t help but wonder if there&#x27;s an element of psychology that needs to be noticed and addressed here (and whether it is actually key that a doctor is respected (for the right reasons, obviously. Specifically: that they will be able to address the problem addressed to them)). My hypothesis is that a good doctor is someone who asks the right questions but also looks for questions that need to be asked for that individual&#x27;s needs. Example: the patient has the symptom of a broken arm, but why is that. Is there something more here? Is there some form of domestic violence involved? Or... do they have a weakness in the opposite arm, and when cycling they are more likely to fall off.<p>One of my doctor friends said to me that they&#x27;d recently shown that the better the Doctor communicates with a patient, the lower the chance of lawsuits. I like to call it &#x27;managing expectations&#x27;, from the whole project managementy world although someone will shoot me for saying that!<p>It may well be the case that on paper checklists work best, but I assert that there&#x27;s a lot more personality and social interaction to a doctor than anyone initially realises. The challenge in this space is marrying the two concepts.",1411322325

They had a fairly consistent rate of 1 in 100 requests return a ECONNRESET error in node. After over a year of haggling with the parse support team the errors finally disappeared about a month ago. They needed at least 10 fetches so you can imagine that 1 in 100 not returning doesn&#x27;t bode well.<p>I don&#x27;t have all of the specifics as to how or why the errors went away, but no changes in the client&#x27;s codebase were made that relate to this.<p>Summary: seems brittle, tech support was useless, customer wrote huge checks to parse every month and didn&#x27;t get traction fixing the problem.

8347767,comment,8347310,8347310,9,0,fyobidniss,,,"I did mobile contract work for 2 years and built most of my products on Parse.<p>The free tier goes a long way. In my experience, if you are thoughtful with the quantity of requests you send from the clients, it will take over 1000 users to push you into the paid tier. This really depends on the nature of your application though.<p>As for development, there are a few nuances that you have to get right to use Parse at full capacity. First, delegate as many operations to CloudCode as you can. I do this for separation of concerns (clients should focus on displaying data, not retrieving and formatting it) and more importantly, to make cross platform applications consistent and easier to write. Also, you can change behavior on the fly instead of creating new builds of your client when you just want to change a small detail, like the number of results to return.\nWhen using CloudCode, take advantage of Parss&#x27;s implementation of JavaScript promises. And avoid mixing promises with the &quot;backbone-like&quot; callbacks. There&#x27;s a bug I&#x27;ve found when mixing the two that will occasionally cause the operation to finish before executing all the callbacks.<p>And speaking of bugs- the biggest drawback of Parse is the documentation and support. Some entries in the docs will actually be a one sentence reiteration of the title of a method. It&#x27;s mind blowing how shitty some parts of the docs are. \nThe support is even worse. Looking through the help archives (they&#x27;ve now given up on internal support and moved their entire support platform to stack overflow) you will frequently find smug answers from the Parse team. It&#x27;s common to see a Parse support teams response get tens of downvotes. It&#x27;s bad.\nI once found a bug in Parse&#x27;s method to save multiple objects at once (if the first request failed, all subsequent requests would fail too) and getting a fix implemented was a huge pain. I had to go through Facebooks bureaucratic big reporting process only to be told the bug was a &#x27;feature&#x27; weeks later. I resubmitted the bug with all kinds of proof and demo projects, and finally after a few months I got the email saying the big was fixed. Huge pain.<p>Overall, if a prototype backend will suit your needs, I highly recommend Parse. It&#x27;s certainly not the pie in the sky it could&#x27;ve been, but it gets the job done and lets you quickly get to market.<p>The free push notifications, data dashboard, and analytics are some nice sugar on top too.<p>I will probably continue to build my products on Parse, unless I know I will need immediate scale, or a client requests a specific backend configuration.<p>Been wanting to try Firebase too. It&#x27;s a Parse like BaaS where everything is done in realtime. Very cool, but still somewhat unproven and new. Has anyone used Firebase?",1411322232

Yes, having a large static array would be a fine specific reason to use the smallest size possible.  But what would be the benefit when you are dealing with the argument to a function in an example like this?<p>Most of the time the argument starts in a register, is passed in a register, and returned in a register.  Using a smaller size often just means that the compiler adds some unneeded conversions as in this case.  Usually this doesn&#x27;t matter, but when it does, the benefit is almost always in favor of the simpler rule of always using 64-bit variables.",1411322014
8347754,comment,8346159,8347598,3,0,azernik,,,"I think the insight is that if a company has lots of revenue per employee (headcount correlates pretty well with overall operating costs) they&#x27;ll take that as a signal that they&#x27;re doing well and can afford to expand. And then they&#x27;ll do this until they no longer feel like they&#x27;re in such a secure financial position.<p>This, by the way, is why the multiplier is lower for well-funded companies - if they have more runway in the bank, they&#x27;ll feel better about a lower level of revenue per employee, since they don&#x27;t have to operate at a profit in the short term.",1411321992

So you get maybe 80% accuracy recognizing the linear trend, and then another correction for the valuation.<p>As such, even 1 correction is kind of twiddly, since it does pretty good with average salary.

8347747,comment,8347310,8347310,6,0,SurfScore,,,"I have had tons of problems with parse. Our app has both the iOS and website backends using it. While it is useful, and a lot of stuff is well done, when you operate at any kind of scale you keep running into all kinds of hidden limitations. We have ~30k+ weekly actives.<p>For example - \nHorrible limitations on queries. You can only get 1000 total objects at any time, batch requests are limited to 50 objects, limit of 100 count requests a minute (not sure the exact number but it&#x27;s really close). Not just for each client, for your ENTIRE APP.<p>No good backup solution. They say they back up their servers, but backing up your own data is left to you. Which is a pain in the ass because of point one.<p>Awful support. I get that they have a lot of people and can&#x27;t support everyone well, but I have always gotten the feeing that Parse just doesn&#x27;t care that much about users. Maybe they do if you pay them a bunch of money, but until then you&#x27;re on your own. Half the time my support requests go unanswered, sometimes the rep just stops responding midway through the conversation. Only recently did I ever have a good experience with Parse support (thanks Christine!)<p>To top it all off, apparently they silently changed the way batch API requests were counted and never told anyone. Instead of a batch request counting as 1 request, apparently it now counts as each individual object inside the request. So batching 10 objects is one http request but 10 Parse API requests. Sketchy. When you reach over 30 requests per second, they just start dropping requests.",1411321811

Why caring about optics instead of revenue is a bad idea.  Why peddling reputation instead of product can get you in trouble.  How dangerous founder-founder disagreements can be for morale and success.  How important it is to hire good talent.<p>The fact is, if you choose to start your career working for a startup, you will likely work for a failing one.  That can be a more valuable lesson than working for a successful one.<p>Established companies have largely weeded out inefficiencies, problems with product-market fit, and so on.

I can tell you that my pet peeves with OpenGL have nothing to do with what&#x27;s being described in any of the articles.<p>Some of the top issues I face include 3D font rendering (way too many polygons), multi-view videos (e.g. tiled videos, which push texture size limites, or multi-stream videos, that bring a whole bag of threading issues), large numbers of large textures without the ability to manually optimise them (e.g. 12G of textures in one use case).<p>Heck, even the basic shader that combines 5, 8 or 9 views into one multiscopic layout for a lenticular display makes a laptop run hot for a mere HD display, and requires a rather beefy card if you want to have any bandwidth left for something else while driving a 4K display.<p>Many of these scenarios have to do with limitations of textures sizes, efficient ways to deal with complex shapes and huge polygon counts that you can&#x27;t easily reduce, very specific problems with aliasing and smoothing when you deal with individual RGB subpixels, etc.<p>Of course, multiscopic displays are not exactly core business right now, so nobody cares that targeting them efficiently is next to impossible with current APIs.",1411320989

Note that &quot;HIPAA compliance&quot; is somewhat of a loaded term in that there aren&#x27;t many super-technical benchmarks to meet, but a general &quot;do-good&quot; attitude including (but not limited to) some of the following points:<p>- Physical server isolation: you cannot have other instances sniffing around in your deallocated garbage memory.<p>- Encrypted data stores: physical theft of the server should not provide access to your data.<p>- Server providers who can sign a Business Associate Agreement: many hospitals and firms with medical data require this in their stipulations.<p>- Audit trails for database modifications, access, etc. Basically, log everything, and this has to be encrypted too if it contains protected health information (PHI).<p>- All PHI over HTTPS if you have a webapp. NO PHI OVER EMAIL OR HTTP.<p>- &quot;Soft&quot; guidelines such as password complexity measures, auto session expiration, disallowed multi-sessions.<p>Again, this is not an exhaustive list. You really need to check with a lawyer who knows this stuff. The fines are enormous (read: business-ending) if you break the rules.<p>How do you work to implement these?

A doctor can forget to wash his hand while a machine cannot forget. So that is a place where computer assisted techniques make sense just like the case of flying a plane where the autopilot can take care of most things except when things go wrong and humans have to take over. I don&#x27;t think anyone with adequate experience in healthcare and technology would make wild claims about replacing doctors with machines. There are plenty of places where machines can aid doctors and simplify processes at scales thereby letting doctors focus on more complex things. That&#x27;s how the automobile industry evolved and so will healthcare. But doctor&#x27;s will always be needed. They would just be doing different things or existing things in a different way.<p>There are plenty of people in this part of the world (Eg. India) where people are just getting to the point of trusting a ATM machine with cash withdrawal. Assuming machines become better than doctors at asking patients the right kind of questions, knowing when they are lying or just not able to communicate their problem, there is still a significant barrier and probably a generation of cultural changes that would make it acceptable to have a machine as your primary care giver. Diagnostics have been using complex technology for a while, so there is no doubt about technology improving the decision making process. However diagnosis is just one and probably a small part of the healthcare process. Actually improving the patients health requires following a treatment plan and adherence to lifestyle and medical processes. Most people just fail to comply due to behavioral reasons. This is where technology and so call &#x27;AI&#x27; can play a role.

I used the parse js SDK to create a SPA.<p>I did think the on boarding experience could be a bit better. The docs are good, not great. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with down time but my app is probably much smaller. I would definitely use it again.",1411318981

From a development perspective I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s relatively painless.<p>I did encounter a &quot;bug&quot; wherein certain queries can&#x27;t be cached effectively which I solved by using vanilla arrays instead of Parse&#x27;s PFRelation. No downsides to doing it that way (for this project) but it felt awkward. It would be better to have more consistent caching behavior.<p>I encountered other issues but that one is top of mind at the moment.<p>I have seen downtime during development. It&#x27;s usually short-lived but it&#x27;s there nevertheless.",1411318954

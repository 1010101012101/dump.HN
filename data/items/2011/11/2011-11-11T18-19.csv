With todays hardware they'd be a lot nicer to use.<p>Users have been limited to quite small (sorry about my incorrect terminology here, I'm going to go read some man pages) total virtual screen size within which their windows were located.  Now graphics cards, and system memory, are huge; this leads to possible radical new interfaces.<p>Imagine a ""Zoomable UI"" - documents open in their own full size window; any document opens in its own window tiled next to it; the user can zoom in as far as they like to do detail work, or out as far as they like to organise all these documents.  Programs would open toolbars in their own windows.  Any toolbar would be able to work on any document (because it's Unix, so all input and output is text, right?) - but the result wouldn't necessarily make any sense.<p>That's not particularly radical; tiling WMs exist already.<p>[1] (<a href=""http://nooface.net/3dui.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nooface.net/3dui.shtml</a>) {my favourite is FSV.}",1321037886

I was using the phrase ""quantum physics"" as shorthand for what, I suppose, I could have more specifically described as ""...the mechanics and dynamics of matter at a subatomic level, at least according to theory.""<p>I'm a layperson, and you are a physicist, and there is no question that you understand these domains a lot more clearly and thoroughly than I do. And there is no question that my usage of certain terms is going to strike you as imprecise. That said, I believe there can be some leeway in the usage of terms to make them more immediately communicable to an audience of mostly laypeople. Smart laypeople, sure, with a greater basic understanding of these topics than your average person on the street. But, by and large, not an audience of trained theoretical physicists.<p>When I said that ""quantum physics"" is ""the problem,"" I did not mean to reify quantum theory. Then again, I don't think most readers of my post would assume I was trying to do so.

Despite the obviously higher costs of running a hospital on a ship, vs running it on land, from a strictly logistical standpoint?<p>I guess it's conceivable.  I admit I do hear these rumours about U.S. medicine and malpractice insurance, and also that the U.S. spends more on healthcare than civilized nations while still getting lower quality of care (all rumours for which I have no citations).  But the weird part there is that, according to those rumours, the countries that outperform the U.S. all have more regulation, not less, so that doesn't fit.  Also, medical tourism is a real thing, so maybe the same market forces could be exploited on a hospital ship.  But then again maybe not, because I'd guess that some of those market forces include doctors and lab techs who (relative to the U.S.) have really cheap living expenses.<p>Anyway.

There is a whole third dimension to start using. Although it won't scale exponentially in sheer numbers, it may scale by introducting new topologies.<p>- 'Heisenberg effect': single atom transistors have been built and uncertainty in the observation of its state is not the problem. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is not the issue here.<p>- Quantum computing will not solve the issue. It can solve some specific classes of problems spectacularly fast. For most common problems, it's not even (significantly) faster in theory.<p>- Nobody knows what kind of quantum computers will be technologically possible. There is no reason whatsoever to assume that quantum computing will ever replace 'regular' computing. My personal prediction is that it will track the record of fusion power for the decades to come: i.e. no practically useful results. Experiments in my university tended to go awry if someone in across the hall received a mobile telephone call. They invested quite some time and energy into shielding the experiments, to little avail.<p>And a minor nitpick:<p>- ""quantum physics"" is a theory. The obstacle isn't ""quantum physics"", it's the experimentally observed granularity of reality and what you can reasonably build out of those granules.

(In fact, I worked as a line cook one summer and I wasnt very good at itso not everyone can even be a line cook.) There is obviously a spectrum, and if were going to point out fallacies then youve set up a false dichotomy: that theres either things everyone can be or things few people can be. This isnt true, and Im simply saying that software engineers are a scarcer resource than chefs. I dont disagree that the chef at Google legitimately contributed to the value the company created, but I think there are plenty more chefs that could have done so than there were software engineers who could have built the core technology the company was built on.

You have to when, rather than getting a bunch of sales from people all over, you get one check each month from Apple.<p>However, the other side of this tradeoff is that check from Apple is a lot more than it would be otherwise. In fact, I can safely say, that my business would not exist <i>at all</i>, if it were not for Apple and the App Store.<p>For people like Jalkut, who is one of the inner-circle of mac developers and fairly well known, there are many marketing opportunities. When he releases a new product, he is assured that daring fireball will write it up, and others as well, and suddenly he'll have a huge opening day.  This is what worked for Wil Shipley so well.   But we're not in that category.<p>Unlike the ""chosen ones"" (and it really is an insular, exclusive circle of those types who get that kind of coverage) most developers would not be able to even have an app business if it weren't for the App Store.<p>Thus, the App Store has allowed tens of thousands of startups to be built by a much broader segment of the population than ever before. You don't need VC, you don't need a bunch of employees, you don't even need an angel round, you just need a Mac, some time, and an $99 a year Apple developer account.<p>In addition to our startup, I have a friend who has supported himself for the past several years doing this writing apps.  He's not trying to ""do a startup"", he's just started a lifestyle business.<p>Apples ""control of destiny"" is intrinsically linked to that opportunity.  The opportunity comes form Apple selling your software for you in a single location.  The only way Apple can do that-- given that people are constantly looking for opportunities to harass, denigrate, and sue Apple-- is to control what apps appear in the store.<p>Apple gets sued because people think that their free software update wasn't good enough!  Serious class action lawsuits get launched for crap like that.  So, of course, Apple is going to watch what's in the store.<p>But so long as you're offering a legitimate app, not trying to scam people, Apple doesn't really care.<p>I know people who have hated apple for 30 years think that this is some draconian thing... because every large company they've dealt with has habitually screwed over everyone they could.   My thirty years as an apple customer giving superlative support and bending over backwards to <i>not</i> screw me over, gives me a great deal of trust in them.<p>Finally, there really is no real point in this campaign of worrying about whether Apple has too much control. Its obvious that its not illegal for Apple to offer an App store.  So, why are we getting the daily articles like this?  Why the campaign?<p>Its because the campaigners have an agenda.  Their agenda is to promote android, and maybe get enough popular support for this idea (I once had someone tell me I was stupid for developing for iOS instead of android-- someone whose a consumer who knows nothing about anything technology wise has been reached by this campaign!)..... if the campaign is successful enough, then maybe they'll get legislation passed.  Just like the anti-patent campaign wants to undermine patents, I think that's the real goal here.<p>And just how does it increase freedom for app development to be regulated by the government?   We can see how that's worked out in other areas of government regulation of technology (though maybe the crowd here is too young to remember the dark ages of landline phone service where there was no innovation... certainly you can recognize that there are only 3 major cell carriers, and thus the prices are high.  That's the result of the government deciding there could be only 3 spectrum owners in each metropolitan area, limiting competition via regulation.)<p>If Apple becomes untrustworthy, then we'll migrate our business. We'll take a hit, obviously, but the bigger fear is that there isn't any other venue to access the market like the App Store.  Putting up a website and getting people to go to it, and then getting people to part with money is a whole lot more difficult than getting into the appstore.  And it's a whole lot more expensive than Apple's %30 cut.<p>Apple is giving a huge opportunity here, and the restrictions of it are intrinsic to its nature.",1321035902

Ubuntu has been an interesting experiment in whether such an open-source system can also be designed to be competitive with a casual market; they're finding that the casual market's extremely difficult to penetrate, and so they're trying to innovate and make something genuinely appealing. I'm curious to see if they succeed or not, but it doesn't really matter either way, because Linux remains the turn-into-anything choice for people who need (or just want) more control over their computing environment.<p>As Ubuntu makes drastic changes, a new iteration of Linux becomes the go-to for people who want a conventional installation. Maybe it would have made more sense for Ubuntu to remain the conventional brand and for a newly-branded brand name to be the one fiddling with Unity, but Ubuntu's already got a name for itself and Shuttlesworth wants to take advantage of it. I think it's beautiful how Linux is capable of branching and splitting so painlessly.

Latin in particular forces you to think about grammar in a more rigorous way than English does, and in doing so, it helps you ensure that you say exactly what you mean. Latin is a highly inflected language, meaning that individual words carry almost all of the grammatical information necessary to parse a sentence. Large classes of ambiguity that exist in English are simply impossible in Latin because of this. I've compared Latin to statically typed languages in the past, and I think it's an apt comparison.<p>You have to think through what you say before you begin, because otherwise it's nearly impossible to make a grammatically correct sentence if you need to switch your phrasing. This practice has the side benefit of making sure that what you're trying to say actually makes sense. Put another way, clarity of grammar leads to clarity of thought. Near fluency in Latin has changed the way I speak English for the better, primarily for this reason.<p>I do not know Arabic, but as I said, I think that knowing Latin has helped me tremendously even though I can no longer speak it or actively use it.",1321035773

Thats just a remnant of the Puritan work ethic. The economic fact is that we get paid more money because there are fewer people available to do what we do. Generally speaking, anyone can be a line cook, a bricklayer, or a janitor. When (more or less) anyone can do a job, it doesnt pay as well because the available workforce is ample. If a software developer got paid as much money as a line cook, then software developers would be deployed at tasks that dont warrant their more valuable time given their (relative) scarcity in the workforce. Deploying scarce resources in a suboptimal fashion is bad for everyone in an economic sense. Its like using copper during the war effort to make brass bathroom fixtures instead of wiring for airplanesits a poor (and potentially disastrous) use of the resource.<p>You can see this at work in NYC right now: the relative ease at acquiring financing means there are a lot of really dumb startups here right now with stupid ideas and no real market that are tying up valuable engineering talent which makes recruiting harder for legitimate startups that are genuinely creating value. Imagine if all the engineers who worked at Google during the early days were instead tied up working for Pets.com and Webvan such that Google was never really able to get off the ground and folded. That would have been bad for everyone, because Google ended up creating a lot of real value and Pets.com did not.<p>This same reasoning, I think, applies to the question of why CEOs get paid such astronomical salaries. The answer is that the kind of people with the skills to run a large company are extremely few and far between. Sure, a lot of them do fail at their jobs despite getting paid so much money; but that's not a reason for a hew and cry about how much theyre paidits (usually) simply a testament to how hard the job actually is to pull of successfully. (Incidentally, its a common lament that the people at the top get paid <i>disproportionately</i> more than everyone else. But thats just because the scale doesn't increase linearlyit grows exponentially. I'm not sure what the outrage against such a fact isif youve taken differential equations youll remember that myriad complex mechanical, electronic, chemical, astronomical, biological, economic, etc. systems have nonlinear characteristics.)<p>So the idea is that salaries for scarcer resources are generally higher such that only enterprises creating sufficient value (i.e., profits, or at least a general confidence in future profits) to pay for them are the ones who get them. Its certainly arguable whether this is what occurs in practice; andwhile there are always exceptions, transients, and outliersI think by and large its a good approximation.<p>This is kind of tangential to @jacquesms point, I know, because hes simply pointing out that we should be cognizant that we get paid more for arguably easier workbut all the same I think its important to keep in mind that making things more ostensibly fair may not always be in everyones best interests in a larger sense.",1321034857

I want my interaction with the desktop to be like that with a prostitute: minimal, direct, clear, and without my having to know much at all about the other party.

The study itself isn't invalid, but the conclusions are.<p>It's easy to read the evidence -- put in more effective practice/studying, and your rates of success and capabilities will be higher than any marathon/cramming will ever do for you.<p>A fine sentiment, until its applied to the general world. And in the real world, there is plenty of hard-to-do work that needs to be handled. I guess all my hard-to-do work that I'm responsible for as an employee, friend, father, volunteer, etc. is simply a ""busyness"" choice that's preventing me from reaching the stars in some focused endeavor.<p>It's completely anecdotal, but I know several people who follow the focused-drive-limited-busyness approach. I find two common traits about them: 1) they are highly competent in their chosen field, and 2) they are stunningly boring.<p>The world needs experts, but life needs well-rounded people.

3225465,comment,3225426,3225426,3,0,unalone,,,"One important bullet point this article left out:<p>* Identify a significant social problem, and endeavour to solve it through innovation.<p>Nest has a big page on its site (<a href=""http://www.nest.com/why-we-made-it/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nest.com/why-we-made-it/index.html</a>) explaining how much energy is wasted by thermostats every year. This has an impact both on personal finances and on the environment. Nest isn't succeeding just because it's well-designed; it solves a problem both for individuals and for larger society.<p>Apple's known for its talk about the intersection of technology and the liberal arts. Steve Jobs was always the most excited when discussing what his technology would let people <i>do</i> that they couldn't do before. Both Jobs and Tony Fadell at Nest aimed higher than just making an attractive product/making a good profit. They made sure that the products they made were going to do something useful for the people who bought them, and possibly for greater society as well.<p>If we're going to learn from Apple, I think it's essential we learn that innovation isn't just about getting a product to do something it hasn't done before. It's also about figuring out which products might significantly impact society if they were done differently  both because it's a nobler aim and because if you figure out how to change the world, come on, your marketing basically writes itself.",1321034426

You're left fighting multiple levels of indirection, trying to figure out what the system is actually doing so you can <i>fix it</i>. Much of the indirection comes from Debian, but it seems Ubuntu finds a single use-case, and then builds more indirection <i>on top</i> of the Debian indirection.<p>Needing to download 5GB of intermediate packages to go from karmic -> oneiric one release at a time (way to ruin apt-get, guys), a weekend fighting remotely with what turned out to be nouveau (which given its hard locking a fresh install, shouldn't even be enabled by default), and Unity tonedeafness have signalled to me that it's time to move on.<p>I'm giving Arch a try, and it's refreshing that I can just <i>edit</i> /boot/grub/menu.lst without having to figure out the abstraction built on top to do things the ""right way"" (and avoid being overwritten). However, if Arch doesn't work out, I'm settled on straight up Debian. At least with Debian, the indirections actually get me something.",1321034413

I remember one, memorable response: ""Just stop, its been widely accepted by us that Apple stole the GUI from Xerox"".  Its rare that someone uses the popularity of a myth as justification for its truth, but there it was.)<p>Already, the same people are claiming that multi-touch has existed for years before the iPhone, and pointing to single-touch panels of the crossed wired style, or stylus driven interfaces as ""proof"".<p>From this I conclude that most people who oppose patents and  innovation do not understand technology well enough, or do not have any engineering background, and thus cannot tell the difference between two sheets of plastic with a grid of intersecting wires where pressure causes the wires to connect, and a capacitive touch panel, that maps out the shape of each picture, uses an accelerometer to determine the orientation of the device and then figures out which finger of the hand is touching it and thus from that, which pixel in the amorphous blob of contact the user is intending to touch.<p>To them, they're both the same, and thus Apple's not innovative because its all been done before, and we should shut down the patent system.<p>I just wouldn't expect that kind of ignorance on a site dedicated to High Tech Startups where, you pretty much have to have at least one founder who knows how to write software.",1321034411

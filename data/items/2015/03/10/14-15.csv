Finder is terrible. Window management is terrible. Installing uBar helped a bit with Window management. I&#x27;m going to be working in OSX for a long time, but for file and window management, give me Windows 8.1 any day of the week. Or Windows 10, which is purring along nicely on my six year old Dell laptop.",1425999598

Also we have email tracking built in so you will get a notification when somebody opened and read your message.<p>This is just our first version and first step in crusade against email. Every other month we will take one completely broken piece of email and reinvent it with new interface, awesome features and business logic. Our goal is to build proper email client step by step and tailor it for the needs of heavy inbox users just like us. We will introduce crazy things like being able to close tasks in JIRA from email notification without opening JIRA itself, or present all newsletters and promotions in a feed with 1-click unsubscribe button for each. Or how about locking your inbox from cold emails so random people without intros don&#x27;t bother you? Those are just some ideas that we have in our backlog, and we know that all of them are technically possible.<p>We are a relentless team of 6 people who are bootstrapping with 0 money in our free time, and we don&#x27;t plan to stop.<p>It&#x27;s for iPhone and Gmail only right now, sorry Android guys and IMAP/Exchange users. We can&#x27;t do everything when all we have are our evenings but we will get there we promise.<p>Here is link on Product Hunt, we are launching bootstrap way ;)\n<a href=""http://www.producthunt.com/posts/mailburn-3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.producthunt.com/posts/mailburn-3</a><p>Would love to hear your feedback!",1425999530

A rapist at least has clear selfish motives with a disregard for human decency; someone who&#x27;s power-tripping and saying &quot;you&#x27;re going to do this thing just because I know you don&#x27;t like it and want to make you suffer&quot; is far scarier.<p>But it doesn&#x27;t matter which one is more egregious. The point is that you <i>can</i> call the one thing &quot;rape.&quot; That is a valid word to use to describe it.<p><i>Isn&#x27;t the core bad behavior the concept of abrogating another human&#x27;s free will? Why is sex in this other classification?</i><p>You&#x27;re looking at a two-dimensional figure edge-on so that it looks one dimensional, which causes you to think that these two questions are related, but they are not clearly -- they are about different things.<p>There are lots of things that are scary about rape. It&#x27;s not just that someone has &quot;abrogated your free will&quot; -- they&#x27;re <i>using you as an object</i> and thereby <i>dehumanizing</i> you. This means that certain other questions emerge naturally, like &quot;where exactly does that stop?&quot;. And that&#x27;s a matter of fear for your life (which in law is the crime of <i>assault</i>). It&#x27;s as if an axiom of our logic has been violated: If someone disregards the basic standards of human decency, we lose all proofs/guarantees that they won&#x27;t, say, kill us for fun.<p>If you don&#x27;t understand where this fear comes from, rape will be an academic question for you, and you will miss the real need for social change.",1425998957

If a resourceful attacker&#x27;s only goal in life is to get access to a particular file on your network connected laptop, the attacker will win. Generally this is not the case, the attacker often wants to:<p>1. remain undetected over a long period of time,\n2. in the face of detection they wish to preserve their anonymity, \n3. not be fooled by misinformation,\n4. not reveal anything of greater value to them than the value of the file, \n5. not open themselves up to reprisals.<p>This is much harder. While the defender doesn&#x27;t win short term, a resourceful defender can make the costs to the attacker high enough that future attacks are deterred, the attacker loses, or even that the defender gains more from the attack than they lose.

Of course very good low-end chips, running highly optimized software, but still.<p>I just don&#x27;t really follow their path here. First they make the MB more expensive than the air, but run slower. They also make it lighter, smaller, thinner and quieter than the air (air having light-as-a-feather connotations).<p>I mean, what&#x27;s the deal in 2 years? If it&#x27;s the lowest powered device, it&#x27;ll probably be the thinnest and lightest etc, too. So what about the Air? Will they just throw that powerful brand name out of the window?<p>Will they expect people to buy 12&#x27; and not the 13&#x27; MBA with a bigger screen, 3 hours more battery, more ports and a bunch more (20-30%) powerful yet equally less expensive?<p>In short, it&#x27;s a bit of a strange lineup. And while I agree with you that it obviously is, and may likely remain the slowest Macbook (slowest Mac period, the Mini notwithstanding), I don&#x27;t necessarily see how that means ARM as opposed to continuing with refreshed Intel Ms, or hell even an updated Atom lineup. Is there any indication they want to move away from Intel again? I mean, weak performance is one thing, but this is OS X we&#x27;re talking about, for a device that costs beyond $1k, which probably has good enough profit margins on an Intel M, would they really underpower it even more with a weaker chip?<p>I&#x27;m not very familiar with CPUs though, would love some more of your thoughts on this.

That&#x27;s right, even though it says UTF-8, not everything is supported, and you have to specifically enable support for some character subsets for your DB.<p>4. MySQL replication is... how should I put it? Delicate. There is no integrity checking, and since by default it&#x27;s just replaying an SQL log you can easily get inconsistencies between the master and the slave. There are lots of ways to confuse replication, such as `INSERT INTO my_table (foo) VALUES (RAND())`. There are no built-in tools for integrity checking the slave, and the third party tools that exist have to resort to some really crazy things, like re-inserting tables. I could go on about replication, and its issues for a while, but I want to move on to the other points.<p>5. No transactional DDL. This really sucks when using with something like Django migrations.<p>6. No point in time backups. You either use mysqldump with a transaction (you aren&#x27;t using MyISAM, right?), or you stop the database server.<p>7. Logs suck. No, really, have you tried debugging an issue with your queries, deadlocks, configuration errors, etc.? MySQL&#x27;s server logs (not query logs), are not very verbose, and what the do write is mostly useless.<p>8. Row level locking semantics are at times doing unexpected things. Last time I used MySQL for complex real time write-heavy stuff, I actually moved to advisory locks instead (the support for which is not exactly great in MySQL and could be expanded). This invites contention, deadlocks, and other nastiness where it isn&#x27;t necessary.<p>9. No IPv6 support.<p>10. Can&#x27;t index Archive engine tables.<p>11. Can&#x27;t partition tables by any arbitrary value. It has to be only specific types which makes it too restrictive.<p>12. GIS support is not really there. Lots of basic features aren&#x27;t supported.<p>13. No materialized views. You can simulate it with triggers, but that&#x27;s not nearly as convenient.<p>14. No async drivers.<p>Note that these are very specific features. If you don&#x27;t use them, good for you. No reason to switch away from MySQL just because. It has some advantages over Postgres as well:<p>1. Simple user management.<p>2. Simple database management. No schemas, objects, etc., just tables and views here.<p>3. INSERT IGNORE and REPLACE! You don&#x27;t need to create triggers for these.<p>4. Decent performance out of the box, and lots of knobs to turn when tuning.<p>5. Generally, doesn&#x27;t require a ton of setup time. Install it, create user and DB and code away (Postgres and lots of others have this too, but it is a good feature).<p>6. Large amount of community brain share, so you won&#x27;t be braving a new world here.<p>So, basically, go ahead and use it if it works, but I&#x27;d say Postgres deserves a try too and your 4 points apply to it equally as well.",1425998283

Such design decision\n    made by one of the core hypervisor developer is certainly worrying.\n    We&#x27;re not sure if it would be more worrying if this was done purposely\n    vs by carelessness...\n    \n    2) We are not entirely convinced if the way Xen Security Team decided\n    to address this vulnerability is really optimal, security wise. It\n    seems like a more defensive approach would be to get rid of this\n    dangerous construct of reusing the same memory for both an internal\n    pointer and VM-provided data. Apparently Xen developers believe that\n    they can fully understand the code, with all its execution paths, for\n    decoding x86 operands. This optimistic attitude seems surprising,\n    given the very bug we&#x27;re discussing today.\n    \n    3) This lack of defensive programing and perhaps over confidence (in\n    ability to fully understand all the code paths) has been demonstrated\n    by the Xen Security Team also previously. In the recently released XSA\n    109 [2], the official patch also seemed to address the problem much\n    earlier in the execution path rather than at the actual offending\n    instructions, i.e. those that performed the NULL-dereference. While\n    asked specifically about adding at least an additional check on these\n    instructions, the Xen developers were unwilling to implement it\n    implying potential performance impact.\n    \n    4) This is all certainly a bit disconcerting and we hope we could\n    start a bit more public debate on these issues, especially among\n    independent security researchers. We still believe Xen is currently\n    the most secure hypervisor available, mostly because of its unique\n    architecture features, that are lacking in any other product we are\n    aware of.\n\n</code></pre>\n[1]: <a href=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QubesOS/qubes-secpack/master/QSBs/qsb-018-2015.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QubesOS/qubes-secpack/mast...</a>",1425997694

I have two comments to make on it:<p>1) Peak throughput is not as important as consistent throughput (i.e. less variance between response times).  This makes it a great fit for front-facing web apps, and we have Percona/Facebook/Google in particular to thank for their contributions in improving this.<p>2) Often users do not get the performance they are entitled to, because they lack the visibility.  MySQL 5.6 and above (and particularly mysql 5.7) have performance_schema to be able to track down and diagnose issues.  Memory/transactions/stages/replication/prepared statements/statements/mutexes.. these things are all instrumented by Performance schema.

This massively underestimates the reach and resources of the NSA (or any nation-state actor).\nYou can, to a point, keep out all but the most determined and skilled individuals.\nYou almost certainly cannot keep out the NSA if they really want to target you.  Even a physical airgap may not be enough (see: stuxnet).<p>Your example mentioned HTTPS specifically - how does this help if they can force/compromise the host to give up their TLS keys and MiTM your connection?<p>Secondly - all this does is encrypt the contents of your communication - it doesn&#x27;t hide who you are, it doesn&#x27;t hide who you&#x27;re talking to, and other metadata besides this (yes, I know metadata is at this point a painfully overused term - sadly I can&#x27;t think of a good synonym right now).\nYou significantly undervalue how important it is to hide this information from an adversary.<p>Right now, if a major nation state targets you specifically, you have almost no chance.  You&#x27;d need perfect operational security to anonymise yourself, encryption that can&#x27;t be broken by forcing a local entity to surrender the key, and to implement this every time without making a mistake.  Some people have managed this, but not very many.<p>If you&#x27;re just looking to avoid dragnet surveillance, you&#x27;re in a bad place too.  The information we have suggests that it&#x27;s the metadata, not the content of the communications, that is stored - and very little of that is hidden by using HTTPS rather than HTTP.<p>None of that should suggest that HTTPS isn&#x27;t worthwhile - it very much is.  And there&#x27;s little reason not use use HTTPS everywhere these days.  But it won&#x27;t on it&#x27;s own protect you very much from the NSA - that&#x27;s why court cases like this are being raised (though I doubt it&#x27;ll achieve anything in practice).",1425997019

There is a reason a bunch of paranoid people (includes me) bought faraday cages for our phones. Everyone is trying to break in to the little black boxes we carry around with some of our most personal information.<p>They have <i>ACTUALLY</i> done bad crap. This is normal security research. There is no need to blow normal research and security work out of proportion. Xcode is signed, they can&#x27;t just modify it and let it go. The OS X updater is also likely secure and maybe they just figured out how to trick their own computers to install a keylogger. Good, but it probably doesn&#x27;t work that well. And it&#x27;s fine! It&#x27;s research!<p>Lets focus on the actual violations, not the tools. Exploits and social engineering doesn&#x27;t compromise: people do. Focus on the people who broke the rules which make sure our country isn&#x27;t manipulated in to an oligarchy.",1425996001

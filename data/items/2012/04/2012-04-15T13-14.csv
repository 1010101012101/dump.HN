3843690,comment,3843655,3843655,1,0,Chatz,,,"The accepted answer is spot on. The thing is, to write anything of sufficient complexity in C or C++ requires constructing a new language. I mean this in the sense that you see tons of macros in C (look at the Linux source tree for example).<p>C++ allows you to construct a language (operator overloading, etc.) in a cleaner and safer manner (in my opinion). It also has better performance tools like templates and exceptions.<p>On the other hand it's not obvious when a C++ construct incurs run-time overhead and if you have a simple application, it can be easier to use C.",1334498288

Templates would in essence be xml envelopes embedded in the email html body.<p>Templates are nothing more than xhtml/xml files with embedded html controls such as text boxes, radio buttons or any other valid html controls including basic html elements that an email client can display.<p>A template would be downloaded and possibly cached on the users device from either a global generic template repository for companies that do not wish to create their own or pulled from a companys public template server.<p>The template could be displayed in the users new mail message window as a dropdown box of available templates[1]. When the user selects the given template say for instance a bug report template from the drop down list, the xhtml/xml would then be injected into the body of the email message for the user to fill out. In addition, if the email address has a default template, the email template would automatically be injected into the html email body of the mail message.<p>Template Security:
To help alleviate the potential security risk of a template being pulled down from an unknown or untrustworthy source, perhaps because of the user misspelling a recipients email address domain, new templates that are downloaded to the users device would require the user to accept a domains Email Template Certificate (ETC) which would display the companies identity (company name, email address, phone, address, ticker symbol, hash of the existing template and hash of the new one, etc.) based upon reverse dns lookup queries to the domain in question.<p>For instance, when a user types in bugreports@microsoft.com or other such email addresses, either on the lost focus event of the To textbox (for e.g. the user presses the tab button on their keyboard) or on a email clients parse/verify email event a background thread could be started to pull down the most recent templates. Should the user be offline a cached version of the template would be used.<p>Overwriting templates would also prompt the user to accept the new template, displaying items in text such as changes, version number, support and or contact information etc. I imagine it being a prompt (i.e. message box or modal form) with 2 or more tabs, with the front one being a basic overwrite request with written changes from the OEM, date released etc. and the 2nd tab showing a diff and other technical details for power users.<p>Template Parsing:
It is inevitable that an email containing a template would be replied to or forwarded to another address or set of addresses. The parsing system should only parse the first template (from a top down POV), placing all other content into a previous entries variable.
Should an email contain content before the first template envelope the parser shall parse this content and include it in an additional details variable, making that, as well as any previous entries variable available to the containing systems Business Intelligence modules/handlers.<p>Template Definitions:
A global definition for template types and definitions should be created and maintained on behalf of the system itself, owned, operated and overseen by a board elected by OEM partners and public interest groups, such as the W3C or IEEE does today.<p>Forgive my crude photoshop skills...

It is important at times to specify, but I do not think it is always required.<p>For instance, when you say 'Email is broken and needs to be fixed'. Unless you have the solution I think it is more appropriate to be ambiguous.",1334496032

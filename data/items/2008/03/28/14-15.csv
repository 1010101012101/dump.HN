My biggest regret with AAPL was not buying more of it when I got my first Powerbook is late 2003.<p>The 2008 decline was a factor of questions exponentially raised into panic (by the current economic conditions) about the iPod's sales growth as well as the iPhones ability to gain market share.  Even with those questions, it's still a stock worth holding onto and buying more of.  That stock dropping to 119 recently was an absolute joke.

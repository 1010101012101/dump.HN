I don't dare speak for europe as a whole, mostly because the UK does things more like in the US, see Dijkstras commments on the difference between continental and anlgo-saxon engineers.<p>Yes, we covered the electrical bit of computers briefly, because the chemistry bit is not very interesting when writing software. Two's complement and IEEE 754 etc. are interesting, so we learned that.<p>My physics and chemistry are on high school level only, so energy levels, S,P,D,F clouds is what I remember from chemistry. The last physics I recall was special relativity, general relativity, time and space dilation, quantum mechanics, the copenhagen interpretation etc. I was not really into those subjects and this was years ago now.<p>I don't see what physics have to do with how integers are represented other than the fact that one way to do it is to use eletricity and transistors. Another way of looking at it is to see the registers as tuples of ones and zeroes. In reality, errors happen on levels below the bit, but the best we can do about that is to use checksums etc. or so you use your chemistry skills when writing software storing phone numbers?<p>When I say we learned how to build memory, I mean how to build gates out of transistors, how to use them to build latches and flip flops, building registers and larger circuits of read/write memory. No, I'm not interested in the strings to fermions to hadrons to semi conductors to transistors bit, but knock yourself out ,I will not write down instructions for you how to build a latch out of quarks.<p>We read Structured Computer Organization by Tanenbaum.<p>> Thanks for the downvote(s) by the way!

2196958,comment,2196851,2196855,0,0,mhd,,,"If you haven't done a lot of JavaScript front end programming, I'd recommend jquery. You'll spend considerable time just learning about the DOM and how to select and modify the nodes of your dynamic HTML content. and jquery is basically just a thin JavaScript DSL for doing that. So there's no big overhead you have to learn at the same time and most tutorials and examples target just what you'll find yourself doing in the beginning.<p>Once you feel comfortable playing around and adding minor effects (week or two), you might want to build bigger applications -- which is where a lot of non-jquery frameworks see their raison d'etre, by making it more obvious how to structure your applications. Some people don't even get that far, as they might do a lot on the backend level and are perfectly satisfied with jquery's innate abilities and that of some plugins provided.<p>So I wouldn't hurry things. If you find yourself in need of a framework for bigger apps and/or more organization with your co-workers, browse through some of the ""heavier"" framework at that time. Take a look at MooTools, YUI3, but also at things like knockout, backbone and JavaScriptMVC.(Maybe even SproutCore or Cappuccino)",1297245161

2196954,comment,2195592,2196878,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"CD-R equipment was still hugely uncommon and expensive in 1994  (when many of the decisions for Windows 95 were being made). Most people didn't have the hard-drive capacity to store an entire CD-ROM, nor a computer fast enough to burn a disc without skipping. Early CD burners were SCSI equipment requiring an add-in adapter card to be used. Together this put the CD burner in the realm of the niche product used only by enthusiasts for a fairly long time (in computer years).<p>The decision to use autorun may have been a bad decision but in historical context it was far from obvious that it was bad. The biggest failure in making the decision was in ignoring its likely longevity. By the time CD burners, usb flash drives, and always-on internet connections were ubiquitous it was fully 2 Windows releases later. It's a common failing of imagination to think that it will be easy to remedy design decision errors in later releases easily (see the Y2K bug, for example).<p>Personally I loathe autoplay, even in its milder ""prompt first"" current incarnations. But the magnitude of the poorness of the decision to adopt autoplay pales in comparison to other poor decisions made at the time. The entire security model (or lack thereof) of Windows, which proved utterly unsuitable to the modern ultra-connected multi-user world.  The common practice encouraged by computer manufacturers, OS manufacturers, and ISPs to put ordinary desktop computers directly on the internet rather than behind a NAT layer or proper hardware firewall. The use of null terminated strings in C/C++ along with unsafe standard libraries of string functions. And a myriad of design errors in HTTP and SMTP which have caused a mountain of security problems since. Against those autorun (which, unlike many of the above problems, can be turned off) hardly merits notice.",1297245049

Granted the app store model mitigates  the installation pain, but portability is non-existent, so my hunch is that HTML5 will pick up steam over the long-term as mobile browser support and developer knowledge coalesces.<p>Interestingly I think a lot of apps could go HTML5 today, were it not for subtle issue of web pages being awkward on mobile.  Bookmarks and google searches just don't have the immediacy they do on a computer, so the very fact that native apps are easier to get to is a significant hurdle in terms of user behavior, even if it is possible to develop a excellent mobile-browser-based UI.<p>It's possible Apple, Google, et al could parlay this into a longer dominance of native apps, but that raises two questions: do they really care enough to attempt to sabotage HTML5?  and will developers put up with the hassle of the fragmented mobile landscape?  It's unlikely any of them would cripple their mobile browser ala IE6 because web is important one way or another, but if everything shakes out to an iOS/Android duopoly then developers may decide the pain is worth it.

I agree that Gawker's redesign is horrible, and share his hate of needless javascript (why re-implement half the browser stack?), but his suggestions for improvement would actually be a reduction in functionality.<p>He suggests using real URLs - instead of ""/#!5753509/hello-world-this-is-the-new-lifehacker"" we would have ""/5753509/hello-world-this-is-the-new-lifehacker"". Sounds great, but what happens when you click to a new article, which is loaded with AJAX?<p>> Engineers will mutter something about preserving state within an Ajax application. And frankly, that’s a ridiculous reason for breaking URLs like that.<p>Is it? Let's try things all possible ways (with the assumption that content is loaded via AJAX) and see what happens. Firstly, the current state:<p>Address bar: ""/#!5753509/hello-world-this-is-the-new-lifehacker"", click on a link, now it's ""/#!downloads/5753887"". I can bookmark this, send the link to a friend, etc etc.<p>Option two is to not track this at all, after all preserving state isn't that important, right?<p>Address bar: ""/#!5753509/hello-world-this-is-the-new-lifehacker"", click a link, it doesn't change. I can't bookmark the new page, I can't send the link to a friend, my back button won't work properly.<p>Third option is to use real URLs as he suggested... we need to track state (otherwise we hit the same problems in option 2) so let's try that: Address bar: ""/5753509/hello-world-this-is-the-new-lifehacker"", click a link, it now contains ""/5753509/hello-world-this-is-the-new-lifehacker#!downloads/5753887"".

Things like ""interactive movies,"" animated books, and encyclopedias were often cited as the examples. And Windows would support this experience by making it as simple as turning on the computer and putting in the disc.<p>In practice, of course, it never really worked that way. Games moved away from the interactive movie concept and instead would run an installer for 600+ MB of compressed content. The encyclopedias-on-CD and animated books had a window of about six or seven years before the Internet took over. And when CD burning took off in a big way in the late 90's, the image of the CD-ROM as a read-only medium was destroyed forever.<p>The only place where Autorun might have concievably worked well is on the proprietary content formats(DVDs and audio CDs).

Particularly as I'd regularly seen anecdotes online about how Australia was such an amazing market for the iPhone.<p>It reminded me of Firefox passing IE in Europe recently, the real story was Chrome rising and taking share from IE so it dropped while Firefox was mostly flat. If you're a reporter you'd want to stick with the facts, and Firefox is the most popular browser in Europe (by some measures) but as a tech watcher the future trend is also interesting, though speculative.<p>As for ""I don't see Androids"" I've heard that from people in every country. Market research surveys like IDC may have drawbacks and caveats, but they're way beyond anecdotal observation. My anecdote is that the geeks bought iPhones because they were the early market for a mobile browsing device but now they are transitioning to Android. Android is also expanding the market at the low end, leaving iPhone in the middle.<p>I noticed that other quote but I really wasn't sure what to make of it. IDC are one of the standard guys that everyone quotes for global numbers when they publish them. Telsyte I've never heard of. The fact that he's predicting a number for the end of this year, that IDC is reporting as exceeded at the end of Q3 last year is somewhat puzzling.

Avoiding a full-page REFRESH only makes sense when the current page does NOT change (e.g. doing login).<p>Speaking about overhead, to avoid bandwidth problems related to page-switching  90% of websites out there would be better off if they just added the Cache-Control on their static assets or GZip the content sent (yes, it's kind of ironic that so many developers ignore common-sense techniques already available in the HTTP protocol).<p>Also, if the overhead is in the server-side processing done, then offload that processing making it async and cache the results.

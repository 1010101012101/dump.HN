Unfortunately, it's one of those things that only works well if you have total buy-in from everyone on the team.  Maybe we should avoid methodology that requires too much of that.  Reminds me of how communal living only works if everyone pitches in.  How about a methodology that works entirely off of inherent human laziness and self interest?  XP works off of some laziness.  But it's more like Air Cavalry in Vietnam.  Land the soldiers behind enemy lines, and they have to do something productive just to save their own butts.  Likewise, write some failing tests, and you have to code something to get the tests to turn green.  (pass)  But the problem is getting the soldiers on the choppers to begin with, or getting developers to write the tests.  In the Army, there's the threat of the stockade and the firing squad.  In XP, it's just getting fired.<p>Another problem that startups are supposed to be able to avoid.",1254797820

863334,comment,863228,863228,0,0,dstorrs,,,"They kept talking about ""3 orders of magnitude"" (3 OoM) between ELF (1) and neutrinos (100) which confused me.  I had to go back and recheck the units before it made sense.  ELF:  1 bit per <i>minute</i>.  neutrinos: 100 bits per <i>second</i>.  It would have been substantially better to compare them in the same units by saying 6000 bits per minute.<p>Aside from that though...I went to this article all excited.  The title seemed to imply that they really had something.  Unfortunately, to make it work they need to:<p>1) Improve their neutrino detection ability by 6 OoM.<p>2) Either cover the entire hull of the sub in detectors--tricky, since subs are already covered in acoustic tile and the insides are jammed with stuff, making it hard to retrofit the system in--or use Cerenkov light detection, which requires filtering out light from bioluminesce, moonlight, sunlight, etc.<p>3) Even if all this happens, the submariners can only receive.  So this system needs to be in addition to, not in place of, their existing commo, and they still need to  come to the (near) surface to transmit.<p>Still, great concept.  As other people have commented, would be great to see it used on land.",1254795077

Here's a reflection of nyc I've been working on:<p>My first vivid image of New York City was from Salinger's A Catcher in the Rye. It was an intimidating and claustrophobic image. It was a city filled with sleepless characters running around in the cold trying to figure themselves out or trying to con someone somehow. To Salinger's credit, after almost three years living here, my first impression wasn't too far off.<p>It's hard to find a city more stratified along class lines. Or a place more materialistic yet also so bohemian. A city of greed and poverty but also of immense heart and empathy. It is a city to suite every mood while at times suiting none. A city of everything. A city you want to describe as a muse but stop when it seems it could not be any more machine like and heartless. Among its eight million inhabitants, it breeds patience out of necessity but can explode with anger without warning. And when it does, it may be rude and it may be ugly, but it does not fester and you learn that in New York nothing is personal.<p>If you fly into La Guardia in early autumn, the lights of the city make the overcast clouds glow a synthetic orange. It reminds you the city is vibrant and will be long after you decide to leave. The lights dazzle and mystify me still. Flying in for one of the last times before i leave for the other city on the coast, I don't try to find the places I know but scan the skyline for places I may have never been. Maybe that's the New York mystique, at least for me. After three years, those lights still look alien. When I look back, I don't think of what I did but of the so many things left undone. This is my lasting impression of this city, and it leaves me not with regret but instead hope, for I can always return as if it were my first time.",1254794752

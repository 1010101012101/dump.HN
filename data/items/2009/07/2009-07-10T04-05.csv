697142,comment,697016,697107,0,0,pj,,,"yep, that declaration is crazy.  They're all good tools.  Use the right tool for the job.  I think part of the issue really, unfortunately, is that SQL is tough. It's not taught in colleges very much. I learned it on the job.  I never learned anything about SQL in college and it's not something you can just jump into, but a key/value pair is easy.  Anyone who has taken a data structures class is going to understand it.  It's basic programming.<p>You gotta kinda wrap your mind around SQL though and if you don't have a support group helping you do that, you're probably going to struggle with it.  So I can understand the desire to find a simpler alternative to solve information based systems, something between file based Perl and SQL.",1247201688

697138,comment,697016,697016,0,0,OperaLover,,,"Does the OP believe we really need to have ""database wars"" to match the tired old ""OS wars"" and ""browser wars""?<p>Careful analyses are useful (and I've seen some well-reasoned debates in HN) but what strikes me is that clear-cut cases for using one tool vs another are rare, for web-dev back ends at least.  Witness: the large-scale sites that use various <i>imperfect</i> db solutions.  Yes, they sometimes involve some ""hacks"" to the canned db solutions, but who's found the perfect swiss-army-knife that needs no modification for any project.<p>What <i>does</i> strike me as significant is the mastery level of the db developer (whatever the db on which they have the greatest mastery/comfort) ...because projects sometimes ""go south"" or end up getting late-stage additions of unforeseen complexity.<p>Conclusion:  I'm a db agnostic.  Or maybe ""poly-theist."" There are several good competitors.  None is perfect. Several are powerful, especially in the hands of an insightful and experienced db hacker.  ( IMHO )",1247201272

Austin is full of brainy people distracted by culture and working service jobs just to stay; Houston and Dallas are full of people with an appetite for money and nothing holding them back, not sophistication and not vision either (except visions of themselves driving expensive cars and screwing hot blondes.)  Austin will continue to produce a modest amount of innovation, and Houston and Dallas will continue to produce an immodest number of millionaires.

None of the examples you gave were ultimately sustainable. At the least you'd need an authoritative record of who owns what--and with multiple private defense agencies each having their own record, there will be disagreements. Instead of property rights we'd have civil wars.<p>But fundamentally, we agree--you're not an anarcho-capitalist. And I think we agree that a lot of what the government does is unhelpful.

""If we restrict our use of SQL database to only what they are good at - small, infrequently-written, long-lived records with complex data relations - and start storing all our other data in more appropriate places, we won’t need to push our SQL databases to such high levels of performance or scale.""
A lot of frequently updated data is better off in a relational, or at least normalized, store. If the price of a stock is changing all of the time, do I want to keep updating it in everyone's portfolio document? If you denormalize, you turn a single update into a multiple document update, which turns into locking a bunch of documents or records which might be waiting for another multiple document update.<p>Now, if all of your writes are inserts, it's a little easier to live in a denormalized world.",1247199587

In fact there is great evidence for exactly that explanation.<p>Your other objections were equally tangential. You seem determined to discuss tangents rather than the central points. And what evidence do you have for your sugar hypothesis? Sugar is no different from other nutrients, hmm? So glucose and insulin aren't related to FFA uptake by the fat cells.

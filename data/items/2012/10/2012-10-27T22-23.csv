I can count on one elbow the number of times I have seen the word ""fanboy"" or its faux-hipster alternate ""fanboi"" used in a comment that led to a productive discussion.<p>Everyone has opinions about consumer electronics. Everyone's entitled to them, even when they're wrong. I owned and liked a Windows Tablet PC at one time! But truly and honestly, are we discussing things that gratify our intellectual curiosity when we attack each other or the authors of the fine articles for their bias? Are we really bringing fresh insights to the table when we complain that the marketplace is capricious and sometimes values things we think are superficial?<p>As hackers--and I include in this definition those who hack software, hardware, social behaviour, and marketplaces--our mission is first to UNDERSTAND and then second to INFLUENCE. When we read a review, no matter what we personally think of its flagrant bias or the comments of others on the thread, we should aggressively throttle our temptation to wield the flame-hammer. We need to ask ourselves, ""What understanding would my comment add?""<p>The same is true when we see someone else violating these precepts. The downvote (and flag, where available and appropriate) are the right tools for the job. Most of the time, calling someone out for diluting the discourse simply adds to the noise while simultaneously feeding the troll.<p>(This is one of the reasons I have a personal policy of either responding or downvoting but never both. If it deserves a constructive reply, why is it worth a downvote? If the reply would not be constructive, I downvote and move on.)<p>If we as a community are unable to throttle the bile effectively, then perhaps we should ask the moderators to do it for us. There's no shame in deciding that non-technical articles about iPads or surfaces or what-have-you are better off in /r/technology.<p>I know that in a few days or a week these articles will go away as the novelty of newly released products fade. But the reason I am speaking out regardless is that the echoes of this type of discourse last much longer and I fear they will spill over into other threads. I believe that forums like this need a zero-tolerance policy towards the kind of divisive incivility I've read lately.<p>I'll close by misappropriating an old joke: ""Do you know why the flames about consumer electronics are so vicious? Because the stakes are so low.""",1351377969

There had been no long-range plan since de Lattre's departure. Everything was conducted on a day-to-day, reactive basis. Combat operations were undertaken only in response to enemy moves or threats. There was no comprehensive plan to develop the organization and build up the equipment of the Expeditionary force. Finally, Navarre, the intellectual, the cold and professional soldier, was shocked by the ""school's out"" attitude of Salan and his senior commanders and staff officers. They were going home, not as victors or heroes, but then, not as clear losers either. To them the important thing was that they were getting out of Indochina with their reputations frayed, but intact.

She is not rebranding the products as hers. She is just assuring her customers that she is doing due diligence prior to selling it on her site.<p>I like Fry's just like the next guy and they have great deals, but I don't expect to get high tech stuff there or necessarily high quality stuff.

When we're talking about ""lines"" in Python, one line is exactly one statement, and if you're doing FP, that statement is an expression.  Multiple statements are going to be either stateful, or declaring a temporary name for an intermediate value.<p>I am probably not being sufficiently imaginative right now, but I can't think of any fully-fledged functional pattern which would require multiple statements in a lambda, which would not be better abstracted out and given a name, and I would genuinely like to hear some examples of cases where a multi-statement lambda make for ""better"" code (or to hear how my presentation of this problem might be flawed, because I haven't done any serious Python programming recently enough to be very close to the issue).<p>----<p>In Haskell, a language where the syntax has been exhaustively designed to facilitate FP, the only places where you'll see multiple lines (I'm pretty sure this is exhaustive, without using GHC extensions, eg. Arrow `proc` blocks) are:<p>* Pattern matching function arguments<p>* Giving things names with `let` or `where`<p>* In a monadic `do` block -- which is just sugar that reduces to single-expression chain of lambdas, and are not equivalent to multi-statement lambdas",1351376340

I object to the cheap argument for ""balance"" that commonly shows up when someone is making a specific point. ""By all means, let's acknowledge X, but on the other hand let's not throw out Y"" -- that kind of thing. I object because it's so unobjectionable. Who could be against it? It just sits there like a big impassive blob pumping lukewarm water into the conversation and diluting everything interesting about it. That is what I felt your comment did. But my annoyance is at the general phenomenon, not at you. That's part of the problem with these patterns; you can't object to them without changing the subject even further (and coming across as a jerk).<p>The interesting thing in the current conversation is the question of how and why reading articles on the internet is comparatively shallow, more shallow than it would seem like it ought to be from the surface. Speaking metaphorically (and no I do not have ""data"" on this), it is as if it provides druglike stimulation to some outer layer of the brain without ever reaching the deeper, slower layers where the truly valuable transformations are possible. Or, to change the metaphor, it is like the difference between sugar highs and nutrition. It seems clear that it is an addictive cycle, leading to a starvation problem: we spend so much time at the shallow stimulation that we have little left for deep reflection. It reminds me of rats in a cage pushing a lever for cocaine pellets.

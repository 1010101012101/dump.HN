2517164,comment,2516940,2516940,1,0,dutchrapley,,,"I couldn't agree more. For most projects today, Java is severe overkill where a more high level language is better suited. While I'm not a fan of the Java language, the Java platform is rock solid and we can all agree it's not going away anytime soon.<p>I'd recommend taking a look at JRuby. It works nicely with Java libraries and loading Java classes. You don't have to deal with dependency injection. Variables aren't typed, values are. Class and instance methods are managed in the same class declaration. Classes can be easily extended. Classes are loaded into constants at runtime - instance objects are created (and constructor called) by calling the ""new"" method on a class constant (hence no dependency injection required). Class methods can't be called by an instance objects and vice versa.<p>While JRuby would be new to you, it's on a familiar platform. <a href=""http://jruby.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jruby.org/</a>",1304600022

Lots of fun to work with, and allows me to reuse my previous knowledge base.<p>In addition to reusing my previous expertise, there are four thing I really like about it:<p>* Convention over Configuration makes things so much simpler\n* Groovy Language has a lot of great features, allowing for much more concise code (though it does take some time to get used to dynamic typing)\n* Plugin ecosystem - over 500 plugins on various topics allow you to get things done much quicker.  The plugin architecture is wonderful and allows you to compose your from reusable blocks, which could have their own UI.  Best actual (as oppoed to theoretical) code reusability I've ever seen\n* GORM (object relational mapper) is a thing of beauty.  It's fairly implementation-agnostic, so you can use it with Relational DBs, switch to Mongo or Reddis as the persistence backend fairly easily.<p>Definitely recommend you check it out.   In terms of jobs, it's not as big of a community as Java yet, but I definitely see many jobs advertising those skills.",1304600021

2517156,comment,2516940,2516940,2,0,lawn,,,"Here's my take, but keep in mind that I've never worked with programming, I'm just a hobby programmer for now.<p>I don't really see why you have to bind yourself so hard to a language/platform/whatever. You don't have to be a ""Java programmer"" or a ""Python programmer"". Instead aim to become someone who can move around and choose whatever is best for the job, or whatever the job might require. In the end it's just programming, different types of programming sure but never forget that you're basically doing the same thing in a different way. When you see that you realize languages are just tools for you to use, not the other way around.<p>The first step IMO would be to expand your horizon, see what else is out there. Try out the exotic languages you see everyone rave about, give Python a blast or drive Ruby for a while. Do things in Erlang or Haskell just because it's different from Java and mix web development with low level or simply make a game or a program you've always needed.<p>When you know what's out there, when you've gotten your feet wet, then you can focus in on something a bit more. The thing that has kept my interest in programming alive is I've always done what's fun, and I can only imagine that's even more important for someone with 10+ in the business actually working with it. So choose something you feel is fun, oddly for me the funniest things are the new and different stuff (Haskell for example).<p>Long story short: Don't be an ""X programmer"", be a ""programmer"" and go where the fun is!<p>Best of luck to you.",1304599903

In general though, I defy you to come up with an example where you want to define global variables from some other scope where your code wouldnt end up just as clear but more robust with cross-scope variables defined in some high-level scope.

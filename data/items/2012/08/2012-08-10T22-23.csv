It's also clear that people want really easy to use tools.  The only argument should be ""can browser security improve more easily than ease of installation of non-browser software"", but no one is even discussing that because Wired chooses to make this about their female reporter being 'put in her place' by an evil male security practitioner.<p>(Ultimately I assume browser and OS will converge, and installing software in browser will be roughly the same as installing it outside the browser, but for some intermediate period, one of these approaches will likely predominate.  It will be way easier to solve either on mobile than desktop, though -- Apple could easily implement proprietary Safari extensions to improve browser security, and has made installing apps on iOS easy already.

These are exactly the kind of people copyright is supposed to help. This is the very essence of promoting the creation and distribution of new works!<p>If massive industry players like Google are permitted to turn a blind eye to the side effects of their vast resources and almost monopolistic influence, while at the same time making staggering amounts of money helping many people to infringe copyright, then all this does is squash the little guys. It gives all the power back to the industry giants who are big enough to throw their weight around anyway. You know, the ones who have been price gouging for decades and pushing DRM and hiring whole departments to issue takedown notices to anything that vaguely resembles a title of a song they once sold and funding organisations that threaten to sue just about anyone in one of the most flagrant violations of any justice system in recent memory?<p>Frankly, I think Google have been <i>incredibly</i> lucky that the arm's length/safe harbour philosophy has held up so strongly so far in the global legal landscape. Given that the very thing that makes them so potentially damaging to legal rightsholders is their scale, and they make vast sums of money because of that scale, it would not have been unreasonable to go down a different path and impose more of a burden on them in terms of preventing abuse of their systems to break the law.<p>If they voluntarily take reasonable steps in that direction anyway, it sends the right message about corporate social responsibility. That alone is worth orders of magnitude more to them than the eyeballs of seventeen people who are going to go use Duck Duck Go for their searches instead. But it also supports the people who actually created the works you apparently enjoy enough to search for them but not enough to pay for them, which is ultimately good for everyone except freeloaders, since it promotes creation of more work, which more people can then search for on Google, and more people can then enjoy.",1344637717

4368537,comment,4367807,4368356,25,0,tikhonj,,,"It's funny--I have exactly the opposite experience. Namely, I find it <i>easier</i> to write code in Haskell than Python or JavaScript, type system and all.<p>The type system actually makes the language <i>more</i> expressive, as odd as it may seem. For example, you can write code polymorphic on its <i>return</i> type. Even in trivial code this is nice--there is a dual to toString (called read) and constants like minBound/maxBound work for all applicable types.<p>However, this really pays off once you get to things like applicatives, monads and arrows. One of the reasons these abstractions are so useful--and they certainly are, letting one easily write shorter and more general code--is that you never have to specify what applicative/monad/arrow instance you're using manually. This means that there is essentially no syntactic overhead to using a type that's polymorphic like that! In a dynamically typed language, there would be no way to use it without somehow passing in or specifying what instance you want manually.<p>The type system also helps me by constraining the space of programs I'm searching through. Very often I write code that seems reasonable but doesn't work in subtle ways. An example from Python would be code that attempts to index a tuple but actually gets a string. In Python bugs like this--including exactly this bug :)--take me a long time and quite a bit of frustration to find. Once I've found them, fixing them is easy, of course, so the only problematic bit is figuring out exactly what the problem is. The Haskell type system catches  a large portion of these sorts of mistakes as soon as I compile. All I have to do to get that code to work is to get it to compile, which is much easier than trying to debug some Python failing in an inexplicable way!<p>Also, the sorts of properties a good type system (e.g. Haskell's) can guarantee are not all trivial. Sure, it'll force you not to mistake strings for numbers. And this is, granted, boring. But it goes <i>far</i> beyond that! I can guarantee that no external code can implicitly modify my current function; this only works because the type system controls mutability. I can guarantee that calling some function in a test is safe because it won't write to the database or send emails (this is another problem I've had with Python!) or generate a ton of logs.<p>Let's take an example from work. At work, I'm using OCaml rather than Haskell, but the idea is much the same. I'm currently working on the command-line frontend to our program. Among other things, it allows you to specify inputs. Just like any reasonable tool, it can either take paths (actually arbitrary URIs) or just get input from STDIN. Initially, we were using strings to hold the uris. STDIN was represented with ""-"". This is essentially just like a dynamic language. Switching to a proper type for inputs had an immediate advantage--it pointed out every single place we forgot to handle STDIN as an option. Some of these wouldn't have been caught without <i>extremely</i> thorough testing and a healthy amount of luck.<p>Another interesting example is units. A good type system can actually help you encode what units a number is in. Mixing up numbers in cm with numbers in m or kg can create subtle, hard-to-find errors. With a sufficiently clever language, you can just get the compiler to figure it all out for you!<p>In Haskell, you can even use types to encode complex reasoning about the actual behavior of your code. This has two victories--you get the behavior in question for free and it gets reflected clearly in the type system. In particular, I'm thinking of monad transformers. If you want to write some backtracking code, you can encode using the list monad. If you want to write some code that could fail with some error, you can encode that with Either. But the real beauty is when you want to write backtracking code that could error. There are two possibilities: you either want <i>any</i> branch having an error to make the whole computation fail or you want each branch to be able to fail on its own. And you can actually encode this directly in your type! The order of transformers (that is, whether ErrorT or ListT comes first) controls the error behavior. Not only is it essentially trivial to switch from one behavior to the other, it's also clear which one you're using just from the type! This sort of code is both more expressive and safer than any alternative I've seen from a dynamically typed language.<p>In short: static typing  la Haskell not only catches nontrivial problems but also makes the language <i>more</i> expressive. I've found this to translate to code that is both safer <i>and</i> easier to write than the equivalent Python or JavaScript.",1344636548

4368521,comment,4367807,4368356,7,0,tmhedberg,,,"I'm curious what sorts of things you have in mind when you refer to ""pieces [of Haskell code] that require superhuman effort to type correctly""? In my own Haskell experience, except when playing with silly and mostly pointless tricks like doing computations in the type system, I've never really felt like Haskell's type checking has been a hindrance. It's more like those inflatable bumpers on bowling lanes: it only stops me from doing the things that I wouldn't want to do anyway, like forgetting to check for failure conditions or allowing mutable state/side effects to seep into parts of my code that I intended to be pure.<p><i>> However, it's often really painful to get that code to typecheck compared with the effort to get the same code correct in python or ruby.</i><p>I'd argue that in the overwhelming majority of cases, the Python or Ruby code is equally incorrect to the equivalent Haskell code that doesn't type check, it's just that Python and Ruby don't tell you about it upfront, you find out about it at runtime. Hopefully, ""runtime"" means ""during testing"" and not after your code is in production. Or if you want to put a more positive spin on it, Python and Ruby let you run the code in spite of its lack of correctness. If that's the kind of freedom you want, then a dynamically typed language (or even a weak statically typed language) will suit you well. As for me, I've been burned by that ""freedom"" enough times now that I can't think of it as anything but a negative.",1344636355

If those are the commonly held beliefs among the liberal side, well, that seems like a stunning level of misunderstanding.<p>I think the only thing colloquially conservative about ""conservatives"" is that they are colloquially conservative in the amount of power the wish to cede to government.<p>Being a political conservative today in the US, in an ideal case at least, is about freedom and choice.  Generally held beliefs are that free-markets are good in many cases, too much regulation is as bad and sometimes worse than too little, and that government is in very many cases a terribly inefficient use of resources.<p>In principle they do not believe in domination of the masses by a vast corpus of rigid rules.  They believe a minimal set of overarching rules, and leaving much to freedom and choice.<p>That's conservatism in principle, from my view as a conservative.  The reality of course is different, particularly for ""conservatives"" in office or seeking office.  I personally have a hard time distinguishing one brand of politician from another.<p>And there are a vast array of people with sometimes bizarre beliefs that associate with one side or the other of the political spectrum, and the conservative side has plenty of them, and liberals do too.<p>I don't know for sure how this 'brand' of conservatism would apply to programming.  I would suggest though, they would want as much freedom to express themselves as they could get.<p>So:<p>--The idea of strong typing would rub conservatives the wrong way.<p>--A rigid and inviolable set of rules and procedures and processes for how code may be written.<p>I'm not sure what else.  My programming experience is pretty amateur.  My favorite languages to work in are C, Python, and Clojure.  So maybe that says something.",1344636310

4368513,comment,4365908,4366798,4,0,egs,,,"I need to add two factoids to this insightful discussion:<p>There is a big difference between space-filling curves and hyperspace hashing. Space-filling curves map a multidimensional space to a single path through that space that is then mapped to nodes. In the process, they do not retain locality. To our knowledge, hyperspace hashing is a direct intellectual descendant of consistent hashing and has not been done before. If you have pointers to work where data is mapped to nodes in a cluster using a multidimensional hash, please send them to us!<p>And one major reason why multidimensional databases failed to take off is a problem known as ""the curse of dimensionality."" If you implement a multi-dimensional representation naively, highly-dimensional data (say, an object with 10-20 attributes) will require a large number of nodes to be efficient. HyperDex solves this through something called space partitioning (I think the paper calls it ""data partitioning,"" but we've changed the name to be a bit more descriptive). They're kind of analogous to materialized views, very loosely speaking.<p>Agreed completely that hyperspace hashing comes to its own when coupled with value-dependent chaining!",1344636184

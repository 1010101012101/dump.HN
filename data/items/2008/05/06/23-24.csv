Examples in education would be teachers who work and sacrifice to teach children, vs. union representative who work to protect any teacher including the most incompetent. The Iron Law states that in all cases, the second type of person will always gain control of the organization, and will always write the rules under which the organization functions.""<p>(<a href=""http://www.jerrypournelle.com/archives2/archives2view/view408.html#Iron"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jerrypournelle.com/archives2/archives2view/view40...</a>)",1210117480

182969,comment,182222,182222,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Good post, and great writing. I owned a few Plays For Sure players (great ones too, actually) but never bought any DRMed tracks. I did use the time-based DRM (Rhapsody To Go), with which at least it was understood from the get go that you were renting the music.<p>Unfortunately even that didn't work very well, so I gave up on it rapidly. At least in my experience most of the other people who had those players didn't bother purchasing DRMed tracks.<p>I wonder why MSFT doesn't just give customers the same track for free with no DRM. It wouldn't be that expensive for them, and would foster some serious good will, whereas their current position will do the opposite.",1210116707

1316065,comment,1315120,1315880,0,0,glhaynes,,,"Yeah, it sounds like webOS could make a great tablet OS. But I'm not sure about the market reality... apps are so important on these things, and when you've got iPad appealing to the design-centric crowd and Android appealing to the open/hacker-crowd (and no doubt, soon a broader variety of hardware than Apple will ever offer), what place is there for a third OS unless it's leaps and bounds better than one of those two competitors?<p>Considering it in comparison to the PC market: iPad has both the ""cool/design/ease-of-use"" of the Mac and the large 3rd party app market of Windows; Android has the openness/choice/capability of Linux. Those both seem to have a very obvious niche and I'd think will continue to see much success. So what room is there for a 3rd OS? And it doesn't help any that Microsoft's going to want a big chunk of 3rd place, too...<p>Still, it's nice to see more vendors attempting to sell/take responsibility for ""the whole widget"".",1272920306

Depending on crop selection, most customers can expect to break even against the installation cost of the garden with the savings over organic grocery or farmers market purchases and the gas and time for the errands. This also depends heavily on how you value high quality fresh-picked produce and how you value your own time spent inspecting fruits and vegetables in the produce aisle.""<p>But as another commenter points out, this is more about keeping up with the Jones than saving money.  There's a chicness in CA these days in having a bountiful garden (chickens provide an extra level chicness in some places).  And whereas the DIYers have set the trend and have embraced the dirt and sweat of the enterprise (see <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Farm-City-Education-Urban-Farmer/dp/1594202214"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Farm-City-Education-Urban-Farmer/dp/15...</a>), the green-leaning elite are willing to buy their way to the promised land.

1316009,comment,1315652,1315652,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I'm not sure if you want to actually do math with C-Y spaces, or just 'get a feel for them'. In the former case, all I can think of is to obtain a copy of Mathematica (I think the demo will run for a week or a month) and then download some of the example notebooks and tinker around...although my own attempts at this proved fruitless :)<p>If you just want to get a conceptual insight, try the excellent Wikipedia article on manifolds, which is fairly non-technical and introduces the concept of what a manifold is and why you would want to use one as a mathematical tool.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold</a><p>In its barest essence a manifold is a way of reductively mapping a complex geometry. Knowing how to construct one, you can then deconstruct a complex multivariate problem (eg the mathematics of 10-dimensional strings) into simpler geometric problems, using the mathematics of manifolds to escape the hideous logical problems resulting from boundary conditions.<p>Consider an unbounded plane, ie normal cartesian space. You can roam around forever in the X-Y dimensions, boring. Now, suppose it's bounded; for example, mapped onto a finite sphere. This is one case of a 2-dimensional manifold (assuming a perfectly smooth sphere). It turns out that geometry still works perfectly well even though it's not flat. Georg Riemann was out to prove Euclid's parallel postulate by doing a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, and showing that if parallel lines could meet then all of geometry would cease to make sense. To his surprise, it didn't, and he found himself the unexpected inventor of spherical geometry.<p>Now consider a different kind of two-dimensional manifold: the world of Pac Man. Pacman lives in a rectangular world, but he can exit one side of the rectangle and re-enter at the opposite. On some maps he can also exit at the top and re-enter at the bottom.<p>But this isn't mappable to a sphere. Rather, imagine a cross shape, like a +. Please think of the arms of the cross as having thickness, rather than just 2 lines; better yet, draw a cross consisting of 5 squares on a sheet of paper and cut it out. Draw a line around the middle square and put a little pacman in it. Now, take the top and bottom squares and tape their outer opposite edges together. Do the same with the left and  right squares. You get something resembling two cylinders at right angles to each other. Pacman lives on the little square in the middle where he eats pills and is chased by ghosts. He can leave one side of the square and travel via the curved path on the paper to the other side; he does so by literally traveling <i>through another dimension</i> - that is, he teleports (oooh!). It's important to remember that although a direct path along the curved loop of the paper is 2x the distance across pacman's rectangular world, as far as pacman is concerned it's actually zero. When he exits on one side, he doesn't disappear from the game screen for 2x the time it normally takes him to traverse the maze in a straight path, he reappears instantly on the other side. You could represent this in a simpler fashion by using a torus (donut shape), which is yet another type of 2-dimensional manifold, one on which pacman slides around on the surface.<p>In fact, this would be a much better way to represent it (because it gets us out of the annoying zero-length weirdness), but I offer the idea of the linked cylinder because it's worth considering that if you turn it upside down, there is an equivalently-sized opposite space. That's equally true of the donut (the inside has the same configuration as the outside) but less obvious. Pacman can never enter this opposite space unless he finds a way to go around the edge of the paper, which is another dimensional shift again, over and above his opposite-edge wanderings. Is there an anti-pacman there, called namcap? Maybe - or alternatively, you could imagine that when pacman eats a power pill, the ghosts become oppositely charged and are suddenly vulnerable to him - something we might not have thought of if we were looking at the game taking place on the outer skin of a torus.<p>So...manifolds are a set of handy mathematical tools for messing around with contiguous multi-dimensional spaces. String theory somewhat resembles a 10-dimensional game of pacman where both pacman and the ghosts are travelling at varying speed and can't eat each other except when their speeds are matched. When you see pictures of C-Y manifolds they're only slices of the manifold from one perspective. We can see pacman's whole world at one because he lives in 2 dimensions and we have the advantage of living in 3. To pacman we would seem like beings of infinitely variable shape and number, as our bodies could be sliced from an infinite variety of angles. So if your hand intersected his 2-d world, it would appear as a circle, followed by 3 circles, followed by 5, which would then merge together into a sort of oval (going from your fingers towards your wrist). Similarly, the cool C-Y shapes on the math pages are 3-dimensional slices of a 10-dimensional conceptual space, the overall shape of which we cannot meaningfully speak about except through mathematics, and which are impossible for us to really appreciate.<p>This is, of course, 1% mathematics and 99% bullshit.

The Kindle has an e-ink display which is easier on the eyes than an LCD, it's very light and compact, it has free cellular internet access (WhisperNet), etc.<p>In reality though, I found the Kindle to be clunky. The screen is very slow to refresh which makes skimming or searching through a book almost impossible. The web browser ends up being nothing more than a toy, it can certainly render sites correctly, but you can't do anything interactive and even clicking on a link can end up taking dozens of clicks depending on the location on the page.<p>In contrast the iPad is a joy to use.  Everything basically works like you would expect it to.  The screen looks great and is easy to read on.  Especially with the Kindle app where you can switch to white text on black background.  It's maybe not quite as good as e ink, but close enough. I'm certainly not trying to claim that the iPad is a perfect device.

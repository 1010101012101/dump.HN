10030537,comment,10029409,10030089,0,0,modfodder,,,"esata is less ubiquitous than both USB and Thunderbolt (and firewire before it).  External ports have never been standard on any macs and I don&#x27;t ever remember them being standard on any of the HP machines we used (the majority of big budget editorial, i.e. feature films, tv, and commercials, are cut on macs, although fx leans heavily toward Windows and Linux).  We use to install esata ports on some of our machine room systems, as the speed difference was definitely useful.  I wish esata would have become more common but at the moment Thunderbolt makes it unnecessary (and USB3 seems to have stifled it&#x27;s standard adoption across non-Apple systems).<p>Also, aside from the G-Raid, we also use 1 and 2tb SSD&#x27;s (more for portability than the extra speed).",1439135980

DNS is essentially a distributed cache where all records are cached throughout the DNS graph of nodes which the client is using to communicate.

10030495,comment,10024066,10025737,0,0,mistersquid,,,"Partly quoting myself from another wall-of-text discussion forum where code academies were discussed.[1]<p>Some developers need an introduction and/or mentoring. However, once past the absolute fundamentals (e.g. basic control structures and logic), mentoring becomes more strategic (less about technical details), and improving as a coder is a matter of how adroitly one can understand more complex patterns and absorb novel formalisms (frameworks, languages, hardware, integrations, etc.)<p>Growing beyond the level of individual contributor is working with individuals and teams to coordinate the development of more complex software systems. These human/machine systems are very complex and highly dynamic, to the point that there are no accurate models to describe how they work.<p>EVERYTHING is custom and cutting edge. (I&#x27;m thinking here of some of what Paul Ford said in his &quot;What is Code?&quot;[2], specifically section 5.6 &quot;Off the Shelf&quot;)<p>This means that the career paths of developers cannot be predicted by simply taking into account educational backgrounds. Models that try to predict developer careers paths from educational backgrounds are not even close to being wrong because they model the reality of software development so poorly.<p>There will be lots of room for grunt coders who start off in code academies, sure. But some of those coders will start entry level and, after much more learning, go on to help develop world-altering highly-regarded software. Some coders trained at the most elite institutions will never contribute even one code block to a useful project of any kind. (I&#x27;m exaggerating, but you get my point.)<p>TL;DR: Code academies are simply another means by which humans will become part of the software industry and the status and stature of developers so initiated will be manifold.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.metafilter.com/151857/As-Tech-Booms-Workers-Turn-to-Coding-for-Career-Change#6159886"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.metafilter.com/151857/As-Tech-Booms-Workers-Turn-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-cod...</a>",1439134457

10030419,comment,10029811,10029811,0,0,veddox,,,"Like superplussed said, not a great article, but one that raises valid points. Having grown up in the expat community of sub-Saharan Africa and later spent a year working there, I&#x27;ve had my own experiences with these voluntourists and heard plenty of stories from old-timers in the field. Just two of these here:<p>Every few months, colleagues of ours would get a &quot;team&quot; from abroad, sent to them courtesy of their organization. That meant: a dozen young, inexperienced western adults descending on them for two or three weeks to &quot;help out&quot;. The first 1 1/2 weeks would be spent doing odd jobs at the orphanage, perhaps putting up a new toilet block or something like that. The next week would be spent on holiday - visiting one of our big national tourist sites. On the face of it, yes, the team did do something useful. But what were the hidden costs? Most importantly, time. The long-term couple that was usually in charge of the orphanage had to devote big chunks of their time per team for planning: planning how to transport the team around, planning how to accommodate the team, planning what to do with the team, etc. Then of course the team needed constant attention and supervision, not to mention accompanying on their tourist trip. All amounting to several weeks of time that could have been spent a lot more profitably. Also, consider the money aspect: each team member probably paid around $2000 - $5000 for the whole trip. What if that money had gone directly to the project? They could have done a lot more than just putting up a new toilet block (which, by the way, could have been done a lot cheaper by local workers, thus also helping the local economy).<p>Apart from this indirect harm caused by voluntourists, there can be direct harm as well. The project I was involved in once had a pretty major staff crisis following some indecent behaviour of a short-term visitor towards a local girl. Said visitor had just come for two weeks to have a look around and help out a little, so we hadn&#x27;t given him any cultural training (which was an organizational failure, in retrospect). He didn&#x27;t realize that his behaviour towards the girl, which would have been fine in Europe, was deemed very inappropriate in the local cultural context. The result was, however, that the girl&#x27;s grandmother, a vital member of our team, felt publicly shamed by her granddaughter&#x27;s behaviour. (Public shaming is one of the worst things that can happen to an African.) Almost before we realized what was going on, she had sent in her letter of resignation and was packing her bags to leave for her home town. It took a week&#x27;s patient negotiation by other local staff to get her to stay.<p>So yes, voluntourists can cause a lot of problems, even when their intentions and motivations are impeccable. There is a place for volunteers to serve abroad, but it needs to be done in close communication with the people on the ground who know what is really needed. Plus, if you&#x27;re thinking in a time span of weeks, that is almost definitely too short a time to do anything meaningful. If you really want to help, come for six months or a year, then we&#x27;ll talk again.",1439132440

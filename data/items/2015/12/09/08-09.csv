My understanding is that the major markers (such as drug overdose) were at record lows following the Pure Food and Drug Act, a relatively non-intrusive measure that required labeling and some rudimentary testing and inspection, but preceding the FDA and drug prohibition and all the rest.<p>This seems to comport with the world I watch around me.<p>Am I wrong about this?",1449651507

Sometimes even infinite samples do not suffice (I am not kidding).<p>The good news is that there are interesting and relevant tasks (for example classification) where you do not need to know the distribution to solve the task optimally, although if you somehow managed to do so (find the distribution) you would be able to solve the task optimally. Or more  succinctly, knowing the distribution is sufficient but not necessary for such tasks (small mercies)",1449651420

Without being saturated with distractions, there was more motivation to explore and learn how those computers actually work<p>- shift to very few computer architectures that were successful at that time in the West (at least in Eastern Germany (in the 90&#x27;s) it was either Amiga or PC, with a few Macs in schools in the 90&#x27;s). But in 80&#x27;s Eastern Germany alone, 5 different 8-bit architectures were built, with 9 or 10 different models, none of them a direct clone of western computers (with one exception, a late CPC clone in 1989), other Eastern Bloc countries very likely had the same number of domestically developed computers. Sure, the chips were direct clones (only Z80, no 6502, at least in Eastern-Germany), but the computer architecture and operating systems had a few unique and interesting ideas in them<p>- before the 90&#x27;s, copyright simply didn&#x27;t exist in the East, everything was copied and modified as needed without anyone giving a shit who invented or built it originally, I&#x27;d argue that this had overall a positive effect on knowledge exchange, similar to what open source is today<p>Looking back, I think the 90&#x27;s were the dark age of computing. The boring (compared to Amiga or Atari) PC had won, Silicon Graphics went down. Nearly all useful software was commercial and expensive. It was only since the mid-2000s after Open Source and Linux had won, that things started to get interesting again.<p>All IMHO of course :)",1449651372

10702642,comment,10689499,10695387,0,0,Otje,,,"Thanks for the clear train of thought. It took me years to realize this, but I was 16 when CFS took me down for almost 15 years: Not the age that you are trained already to think through independently. Being a patient brings a special role-model that forces you to be still, at home, quiet and dependent. I call that the &#x27;ideal patient&#x27;, it makes you a psychological mess. So yes, this is a result from a physical illness.<p>On the one hand: I found, after 10 years, that dry air on mountaintops really helped me, so we moved from the Netherlands to Munich for a dryer climate. It turns out that my joints ache from humid air, the pain makes the muscles stiff, that makes me so tired. Also sleeping did not help, because I get only stiff and sweaty in the wrong climate. In Munich I could finally go to the gym every day to get in better shape. Now I live in the Netherlands again with a huge airco and infra-red heating system in de ceiling. I get healthy with one click on a button now.<p>On the other hand: There is a study showing that cancer patients that have CFS recover after chemo also from CFS.  I had chemo and recovered very well indeed. This indicates that the immune system is involved.<p>So, I only know now what works best for my personal case. Everything else stays a big question mark.<p>Since there are a lot of different patient groups taken together under the name of CFS, so it is not clear if my solution will help more people. That&#x27;s also why there is not one cure for all. There is not one cure for all these different groups, there are a lot of cures, yet to be found, for all these groups. It is best to search for your own &#x27;painkiller&#x27;, it&#x27;s for now the only way. This is very hard while being ill in the first place, with all the other worries that come along with chronicle illness. I am glad that I just kept on trying to find a solution, also when all others lost faith (only my husband kept believing in me getting better) and not let others force the idea of me being a &#x27;lazy psychological patient&#x27; upon me. I wish you all strength and fortune in your quest for a healthy feeling body.",1449651350

Chan School of Public Health.&quot;<p><i>75%! Tested by Harvard!  This is huge!</i><p>However, take a look at the actual study.  Specifically, page 6, under Methods, e-Cigarette Selection<p><a href=""http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/advpub/2015/12/ehp.1510185.acco.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/advpub/2015/12/e...</a><p>&quot;A <i>convenience sample</i> of 51 e-cigarette flavors was selected for use in this study. Electronic\ncigarette cartridges, liquids, and their associated devices and batteries were purchased online and\nin retail locations. We evaluated 51 flavors, including all available flavors from <i>three</i> large\ncigarette companies (Brands A, B, and C, with 2, 2, and 7 flavors, respectively); 5 flavors from <i>a</i>\nlarge independent e-cigarette company (Brand D); and 24 additional flavors from <i>three</i> ecigarette\ndistributors (Brands E, F, and G, 10, 8, and 6 flavors, respectively) that we selected based on their potential appeal to children, teenagers and young adults (Table 2). In addition, we evaluated 11 e-liquid flavors that are inserted into a cartomizer (disposable cartridge and atomizer system) (Brands H and I, 6 and 5 flavors, respectively)&quot;<p>To break this down a bit..  Let&#x27;s start with <i>convenience sample</i>.  A convenience sample is a non-probability sampling technique.  It&#x27;s made up of subjects (in this case, nicotine juice) which are easy to reach.  It is _not_ a representative sample of the products offered by the entire industry.  You can&#x27;t make probability statements about non-probability samples.  The numbers are worthless in relation to the greater whole.  EG, you can&#x27;t say &quot;Diacetyl was found in more than 75% of flavored electronic cigarettes.&quot;  It would be like going to a Donald Trump campaign rally to poll public opinion because it&#x27;s close to your house and then reporting that &quot;75% of Americans believe Donald Trump should be the next President of the United States&quot;.<p>Add a couple of words, however, and although your numbers are still worthless, you can use a technicality to slip past whatever fact-checking apparatus is in place that would call you out on a bold-faced lie and you can lend some additional credibility to your prejudicial pseudo-science.  &quot;Diacetyl was found in more than 75% of flavored electronic cigarettes <i>tested by researchers at Harvard</i>.&quot;<p>The average person is not going to consider the added qualifying statement in the proper context.  Technically, it lets the reporter off the hook for generalizing because they have now (importantly) stated that the number is only in relation to what was tested.  Effectively, though, it lends a big name institution and all that it represents in support of the reporter&#x27;s agenda.  Most people will read that sentence as &quot;Harvard reports that 75% of flavored electronic cigarettes contain diacetyl, which causes severe respiratory disease&#x27;.<p>It does help the article&#x27;s credibility that this &#x27;research&#x27; was indeed performed at Harvard, was under grant from the NIH, and that the probabilistically irrelevant results were posted on a Harvard website in a fairly authoritative manner as a <i>press-release</i>.  The writer of the article isn&#x27;t credited, so this appears to come from the university itself.<p>But anyway, back to the numbers they listed.  Their sample size, of the many thousands available, was 51.  And it came from...  3 cigarette companies, 1 e-cigarette company, and 3 e-cigarette distributors.  They use only seven (convenient, non-representative) sources  to paint the industry as a whole.<p>If we ignore the blanketing insinuation of the industry as a whole, though, the number they came up with is still of very limited utility.  One company contributed 2 datapoints, another contributed 10.  Biased contributions make the overall &#x27;75%&#x27; figure irrelevant in describing even just those 7 companies comprising their &#x27;research&#x27;.  If a company uses diacetyl in one of their products, odds are very high that they will use it in their other products.  That aside, since the selection of flavors tested are not representative of sales of individual products, there&#x27;s no point in repeatedly testing the products of a single company once a positive result has been reached.<p>I&#x27;m very disappointed and irritated that an institution like Harvard would lend its credibility to a piece like this.  It leads me to wonder whether they are acting with an ulterior motivation or simply incompetently.  In the end, their intent means little, though;  their words will have impact to discourage the spread of e-cigarettes as an alternative or cessation aid for traditional cigarettes.  Is that a good thing?  I don&#x27;t know.  We need better research into this youthful industry that has a significant potential health impact.<p>We rely on valid research by trustworthy institutions to inform our decision making process.  There&#x27;s an opportunity cost to choosing to perform the wrong research and to performing the right research incorrectly.   While some good does come of this, in that specific companies are outed (sort of --  the paper does not list the company names) for their use of dangerous ingredients, the research does not address safety concerns around e-cigarette use in the scenario where a responsible vendor takes precautions by ensuring that known dangerous additives aren&#x27;t added to their products.

It&#x27;s worth a read if you want to build your own DIY sonar system :)<p>I include it here because the work suggests dolphin echolocation pulses <i>may</i> contain sufficient information for dolphins to form something like a mental image of an object, although whether or not they actually do so is unknown.

Such a surface is different from a representation of reflectivity as a function of position, and it allows direct comparison with visual representations (e.g., photographs) of objects. A visual analogue would be very useful to an animal that tries to perform sensor fusion by combining spatially registered feature maps from vision and echolocation. There is some speculation that dolphins may be capable of such a vision-like target representation (Pack & Herman, 1995), although the issue of the cognitive representation of targets formed by echolocating dolphins remains open to debate (Heiweg et al., 1996; Harley et al., 1995; Roitblat et al., 1995), and the lay concept of &quot;seeing with echolocation&quot; remains unsubstantiated. However, a vision-like target representation is well-suited to human observers and could have application to improvement of MCM performance.&quot;</i><p>The synthetic images are pretty neat.

Only for understanding language we have been missing a couple of pieces to the puzzle. That seems still like a miracle.\nDisclaimer: anecdotal evidence.",1449648915

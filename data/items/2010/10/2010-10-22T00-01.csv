The correctness of that statement is completely independent of C# lambdas, which are neither a complete subset nor a complete superset of C# anonymous delegates.<p>And it is ugly. It's ugly because the argument list visually expands across more than one line, including whole statements. The ""redundant"" forms of ""using"" and ""lock"" are both more limited than the closure-passing approach, but their limitations haven't been pressing enough to overcome much of tthe ugliness of the closure-as-parameter approach for this specific case of passing a statement block.",1287709192

His dissertation provides 3 implementations of forth, just as Dybvig provides 3 for scheme. The two papers are nearly identical in scope; showing different implementation techniques for a tiny kernel language. However, the Forth paper is entirely in C and assembly, without the slightest hint of formal semantics or any other mathematical reasoning. It's a hack upon glorious hack. You can't reason about Forth code without FULL abstract execution, to wit, implementing a full Forth VM with side-effects, or emitting 3-address-code, or some other linear tuple IR, and using traditional techniques from register-based languages with variable assignment.<p>Having said that, I can see why Forth might be fun, as a soul-cleansing language for a programmer who has spent too long in abstraction. Haskellers should use it to bring themselves down a notch [<i>grumble, mumble mumble, something rude, under my breath</i>]<p>[Edit:<p>Oh fuck, I forgot about Factor!<p>I pre-accept defeat, and retract my possibly under-informed arguments if and when Slava shows up to this discussion :-)<p>If his opinion differs, I don't think I am qualified to disagree with the sharpest dude hacking on a language implementation today, and Forth domain expert to boot]",1287708284

2.  Gives a testimonial that you can use to sell other similar customers and;
3.

If it takes 1 second or more for each user action to be reflected in application state due to round trip time (mobile web) those seconds add up and users can be frustrated.<p>However, if you move the database and web application to the mobile device itself, users no longer see network latency as part of the user experience critical path. Latency has been proven to be correlated directly to revenue, because users engage much more readily with snappy interfaces.<p>Once data is being operated on by the user on the local device, the key becomes synchronization. Asynchronous multi-master replication demands a different approach to consistency, than the traditional model which assumes the database is being run by a central service.<p>The MVCC document model is designed for synchronization. It's a different set of contraints than the relational model, but since it's such a highly constrained problem space it also admits of general solutions and protocols.<p>It's my belief that the MVCC document model is closer to the 80% solution for a large class of applications. Storing strongly typed and normalized representations of data is an artifact of our historically constrained computing resources, so it will always be a good way to optimize certain problems.<p>But for many human-scale data needs, schemaless documents are a very good fit. They optimize for the user, not the computer.",1287706297

1818019,comment,1817883,1817883,0,0,rwhitman,,,"I totally hear your frustration. I've become incredibly burned out on launching startups / small products that flop.<p>I'd say one thing - Techcrunch is definitely NOT the only game in town for PR. They are very fickle and clique-y. There are huge startups that never made a dent in TC. PR is all about building buzz from the ground up, exclusives are a load of crap and mostly reserved for established players anyhow.<p>If you're not getting any coverage from anywhere, yes maybe there's something at the core that isn't compelling (and you need to talk to customers / users first to determine that), but chances are you aren't spending enough time sending fun personal emails to lower-level bloggers and journalists. If you aren't in the elite old-boys club, you shouldn't be focused on approaching the journalists who are.<p>But PR and ""viral"" launches are hard work. The idea of the massively hockey-stick organic viral launch is largely a myth propagated by a few outliers (aka survivor bias).<p>And good PR does not make a success, either. I've built 2  things that made big PR splashes (everything BUT TC haha) and neither landed me either fame or fortune. The one product was blogged about by the New York freakin Times, and it never achieved escape velocity. PR isn't a long-term marketing strategy. Its a one-time high and believe me the downslope doesn't feel good either<p>Honestly, there are 2 types of folks who make it: the lucky ones, and the persistent ones. Its hard as hell (and heck I haven't beaten it yet) but you have to ignore the burnout and be one of the persistent ones",1287706197
1818018,comment,1817883,1817883,0,0,trevelyan,,,"Hmmm.... my business has always been in the same boat in terms of press, although we are a niche product and so grow essentially through word of mouth. That said... improving the product usually trumps getting an article written in the long run. And never spend more than 40 minutes writing an email.<p>My suggestions for AdSense would be to spend $500 at once rather than trickling the money out. This gives Google enough knowledge of your conversion rates that you can switch to pay-per-conversion. Bear in mind that you also have to be ruthless about excluding websites where you aren't going to get any conversions during your pay-per-click period. So track your spend daily and exclude-exclude-exclude sites that don't convert. I don't know if you've done this, but it basically halved our advertising costs and turned us from advertising at a loss into advertising more or less at cost (perhaps profitably assuming word of mouth, etc.).<p>Good luck!",1287706173
1818017,comment,1817883,1817883,0,0,webwright,,,"I think the big thing that you're missing is that ""great execution"" doesn't end at building a great product.  And PR is not a marketing strategy.<p>If you want to avoid this experience again, choose an idea that:<p>1) Has a broad-content SEO strategy (think StackOverflow and Yelp).  New/valuable content gets created every day.<p>2) Has a channel for ""buying"" customers with economics that work.  Plenty of people make adwords work.  Plenty of others can afford salespeople.  Find a market where people are succeeding at buying customers and compete in it.<p>3) Has a viral loop.  Think Farmville or Groupon.  Why is it in your customers best interest to evangelize your product?  They can be motivated by psychology or $.<p>4) Create a ""tribe"".  Read up on Seth Godin.  Look at Joel Spolsky, 37Signals, etc.  They sell good (NOT great) products because they've accumulated followers and evangelists.<p>It's not about a ""great idea"".  Well, it can be.  But look at all of the shitty products that are minting money!  You can aim for a ""addictive/amazing"" product (and should), but it better be backed by sound customer acquisition economics for the (likely) case that your product is merely good.<p>About your launch day:  You expect to blow it out on launch day?  That's not a reasonable expectation.  It's a marathon not a 100 yard dash.<p>edit: TechCrunch should not be a goal.  At YC there's a word for the period after TechCrunch coverage... ""The trough of despair"".  It's the period of time after TC where your traffic flatlines and you realize that TC isn't a springboard to anything-- it's just the first step (if you're lucky) on a really long slog to building a business.",1287706150

1178731,comment,1178072,1178072,0,0,jdietrich,,,"Unfortunately, this clause would appear to have legal backing. The Computer Misuse Act 1990 states that a person is guilty of an offence if:-<p>(a) he causes a computer to perform any function with intent to secure access to any program or data held in any computer;<p>(b) the access he intends to secure is unauthorised; and<p>(c) he knows at the time when he causes the computer to perform the function that that is the case.<p>The relevant wording is ""causes a computer to perform any function"". This is deliberately broad in order to cover botnets and the like, but would also amply cover deep linking. There is no requirement for the access to be from a computer you control, nor that you personally initiate the access; only that you caused a computer to perform an action with the intent of accessing data without authorisation.<p>Although unlikely, it is possible that any British website could be prosecuted for ignoring such a T&Cs clause.

Those businesses that start to go well will leave.</i><p>By this logic, why doesn't every successful Bay Area startup just up and move to Dubai?<p>If a few rich assholes want to live in Dubai, fine by me, but the successful companies are always going to be where the skilled people are. Skilled people are where the infrastructure (education, health) is best, and you have to pay for infrastructure; that's why taxes exist.<p><i>Finally you can afford some nice things, then suddenly you're taxed at 95%.</i><p>Define ""nice things"". For me, ""nice things"" are good books, cool technologies, travel, challenging problems to solve, and interesting company. None of these have to involve luxury goods. My point is that we'd be taxing people based on what they buy, not their income. In other words, the tax is based on what you <i>do</i> with the money, not how much of it you make. If someone gets rich but is using his money reasonably, he pays reasonable taxes. If he wants to belch tons of CO2 into the air by flying around in his custom-built jet with a swimming pool in it, like a lot of the uncultured mouth-breathers in that set, he'll be very highly taxed for it.<p>Besides, those among the rich who are ascending Society and flying around in private jets are too busy schmoozing and colluding to be building anything useful, just as authors who get sucked up into that high-society shitfest stop writing readable work. (Hard to write anything valuable if you're constantly coked up.) At this point, they effectively ought to retire. If we discourage them from being here, great! They're already past peak, and now they're just taking up space at the top. Their exodus makes room for people with talent and energy.",1268153698

1178698,comment,1178386,1178609,0,0,3pt14159,,,"So you are really asking a two separate questions:<p>Your second question is ""should we implement a social engineering scheme to avoid the regressive nature of the sales tax""?<p>I say ""no"". We do that in Ontario and it has been such a nightmare because it distorts spending, complicates pst filing, and leads to people splitting up coffee orders at Tim Hortons into multiple bills (because a ""meal"" is tax as a luxury if it is above 4 dollars, and no, this was never adjusted for inflation and yes the tax applies to the whole $4.01 rather than just the cent) and other stupid things (never buy 3 muffins at Tim Hortons, you get bumped into the non-meal bracket, but buying 6 gets you the bulk discount AND exemption from the pst because your presumably buying 6 muffins to take home to your kids, rather than stuffing your face with a 3 muffin ""luxury meal""). It is so stupid Ontario is doing away with it and harmonizing with the federal GST.<p>As for inheritance, this will just hit the lower class. Only people with enough money for lawyers will set up trust funds or ""gift"" their children $500k to buy their house for them. Also when you say ""inheritance transfers at 99%"" I assume you mean the government takes virtually all of it. If I were dying and had $100M I'd move to the Turks and Caicos and die there, where I can give my kids what I want.<p>As for your first question, which is basically ""can we implement a simple VAT style tax (ie, tax both goods and services, but let companies deduct the VAT they paid against the VAT they collected) across everything and not greatly disadvantage the poor?"" The answer is a resounding ""Yes"" except for a couple key conditions. First, give every adult a cheque for $7k a year if they have lived in the country for 10 months or more during that year. Don't ask for their income or anything. Then implement a 25% tax on EVERYTHING. ""Ohh, but we want to encourage reading"" NO! Don't let social engineering make this complicated. As soon as you bring in exemptions you bring in lobbyists, accountants, lawyers, and programming complications. All of which slow down productivity growth which, ultimately, reduces government revenue.<p>The second thing you need to do is issue a one time cheque to people that are retired, based on their current savings that are not in some form of non-income tax fund. The reason for this is that if someone has paid income tax their whole life and was planning on using their $200k cash they have in  their bank account to live, you can't just increase their cost of living by 30% or they will starve.<p>That's it. Problem solved. No more tax forms, or telling the government how much you earned, or (besides the one time thing) how much you saved. No worrying about offshore bank accounts, or whether a freelancer should incorporate or not. More math brains in science and tech. More business brains in enterprise. The reason it won't ever happen?

However, the amount of feedback, which economists call the ""multiplier"" is a matter of considerable dispute.  Obama's current point-woman on this has published research showing that the multiplier for much govt activity is typically less than 1.  (She's saying something different now.)<p>> Giving money to people in lump sums (which was in fact about 40% of the bill, the bill was 40% tax cuts) is fast and simple, so it certainly has a place, but keeping people in a job is far more effective because you create externalities.<p>You're assuming that the person is producing something of value and at a reasonable cost..<p>More to the point, the original poster asserted that a job which cost $200k was worth more than just giving the person $70k/year even if we ignore such factors.  (Numbers made up.)<p>Note that Krugman recently wrote that just giving money to unemployed people doesn't cause problems.  This is in contrast to his statement in ""Macroeconomics"" that unemployment payments encourage people to stay unemployed longer than they would otherwise.<p>> That job is producing something of value to the economy, that person is gaining skills/experience leading to future employability<p>I'd agree, but this flies in the face of the arguments used to justify higher minimum wages.<p>> Counter-cyclical spending is, according to economic theory, the one point in the cycle where the government should be encouraged to spend money like they're in vegas, up 50k and hanging at the strip club. Breaking this negative feedback loop is priority #1 -- debt can be paid back later,<p>I know the theory.  However, it assumes that govt does something that the US govt doesn't do, namely save during the other part of the cycle.  Given that, it's unclear that the spending during the down part makes sense.<p>To put things in terms of another HN argument, it's unhealthy to eat the calories that you'd need to train for the Ironman if you're not actually training for the Ironman.",1268152461

That point has been made by the leading researchers on human behaviorial genetics in their recent article that I cited in the first reply to this submission on HN. It is a very common conceptual blunder, which should be corrected in any well edited genetics textbook, to confuse broad heritability estimates with statements about how malleable human traits are. The two concepts actually have no relationship at all. Highly heritable traits can be very malleable, and the other way around. It looks like the author of the new book mentioned in the submitted article has gathered a lot of evidence about malleability of human intelligence, which I will check as I read the book. (I've read other writings on this subject, and regularly participate in scholarly discussion of the latest research on this with Ph.D. psychologists.)<p><i>Intelligence, to be useful, must be used effectively.</i><p>I do agree with this point.",1268151281

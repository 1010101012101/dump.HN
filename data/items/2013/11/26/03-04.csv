I do tend to prefer the UN/LOCODE values just because you can almost always get away with using just three letters to define a location, and they work well internationally.

I run a game on Facebook platform and we oftentimes have bugs that you guys likely consider corner cases because they only affect a very small subset of your users.<p>These tend to happen to our heaviest users who account for a large portion of our revenue. These power users either use obscure edges of the platform or act in unique ways to other users.<p>For instance, many of our top players have been completely unable to access their friends list for the past 2 weeks now. Playing with friends is a hugely vital component of our game and this bug makes it completely unusable for these players (many of whom have been active, paying users of our game for several years now).<p>See Bug 1420634571501183 (recently marked as a duplicate of 681781621832581 which I have no way of verifying since that user didn&#x27;t post an error message and was using FQL rather than the graph api.. I&#x27;m hoping this bug doesn&#x27;t just get lost now that it&#x27;s been marked as a duplicate).<p>This isn&#x27;t the first time we&#x27;ve had a bug like this happen. Allowing developers to put a bounty out would be a strong signal that it&#x27;s an important bug to fix. It&#x27;s not necessarily about the bonus revenue to Facebook, it&#x27;s about giving developers a way to get truly important bugs prioritized.<p>Or heck, being able to buy 5 minutes of a real Facebook engineer&#x27;s time would be valuable as well.<p>See also:<p>Bug 1394861264086269 which is a bug marked as Invalid but has to do with the (relatively obscure) &quot;Game Groups&quot; Graph API not matching what&#x27;s actually shown on the web interface.<p>Bugs 177435992460351 and 242967435851521 which will probably be closed in 5 months because &quot;We are prioritizing bugs based on impact to the developer community. As this bug report has not received much attention from other developers, we are closing it so as to better focus on the top issues.&quot; even though they&#x27;ve been confirmed by FB just like countless other bugs I have reported over the years.",1385438310

6798997,comment,6795594,6796544,10,0,nullc,,,"> There are alternatives to hashing proof-of-work<p>Not really. Peercoin&#x27;s security comes from the developer of the system signing every block. It attempts to use a &quot;Proof of Stake&quot; system where ownership of coins controls mining, but the problem with PoS is, ironically, that there is nothing at stake.<p>In PoW when you attempt to mine you must expend energy and so you should only mine on a consensus which is likely to be the surviving one if you want your work to not be wasted. In PoS the same is not true, and an optimally rational PoS miner will attempt to concurrently mine all forks which he does not hate.<p>Originally the signed blocks in PPC were supposed to be a bootstrap mechanism until most of the mining was PoS based, but then some clever miner started mining many possible histories and finding ones where he magically got lucky and his coins were the selected stake for all the blocks.<p>Primecoin&#x27;s work isn&#x27;t scientifically useful— no one had bothered describing it as interesting before it got pulled out as a PoW, and it&#x27;s far less clear that its not trapdoored (that someone knows how to mine it much faster) than the one way function based proof of work.<p>You can convert basically any stochastic search into a PoW, but not necessarily a good one (e.g. it might have trapdoors).<p>More deeply, if your mining work has independent value that that dilutes your incentive to mine on the one true best consensus, since you&#x27;ll still gain that value even if you mine on a losing consensus.<p>And ultimately the energy is _not_ wasted: It provides security for the system which is shared by all it&#x27;s users. In Bitcoin you don&#x27;t mint coins (with enormous energy costs) or print notes, you don&#x27;t need bank vaults, or armored cars. You don&#x27;t need to incarcerate counterfitters, fly around agents, or suffer counterfeiting losses.  All currencies have operating costs, if Bitcoin&#x27;s costs are comparatively good is a complicated analysis which I don&#x27;t think anyone&#x27;s done.",1385438053

You can think of any metric by which to measure the progress of a programmer and you will find an endless debates about its usefulness. It&#x27;s inherently a qualitative value in my experience.<p>In general though I am motivated by accomplishment. I feel good about doing a good job. It is its own reward. I feel that I&#x27;ve had a <i>good day&#x27;s work</i> when I&#x27;ve contributed something worthwhile that has improved the code, the company or my team in some way, even if it&#x27;s small.<p>I keep my work days structured around the traditional 9-5. At first it was out of habit but I&#x27;ve since embraced it as a discipline. The difference for me, I believe, is that without a long commute and being stuck in an office far from home there is very little cost associated with following &quot;sporadic&quot; opportunities. I don&#x27;t leave time out for them because the benefits tend to out-weight the cost of being away from my desk. I can get up and take a walk down to my local café, chat with the barista about local events and pick up some flowers for my wife on the way home. This relieves stress, breaks up monotony and gives me time and space to connect the hunches together in my mind. I may come back from that outing with the solution to my problem or I may not; but at the very least I will be reinvigorated to take on the next set of tasks ahead of me and it cost the team almost nothing and gained quite a bit.<p>The way I see it my employer was looking for someone who was smart, experienced, creative and responsible. I do everything I can to cultivate that in myself. They&#x27;re not paying me to trade hours for lines of code. They need someone with my experience, knowledge and intuition to help them solve problems and build a solid product.<p>If the solution to our problems as programmers could be solved by rote then I&#x27;d be out of work and in a different profession.",1385437542

And also for the change in tone. I&#x27;ll try to match you as best I can.<p>I think the notions of &#x27;sex-positive&#x27; and &#x27;sex-negative&#x27; are kind of weird, personally. When I read those terms, my mind tends to translate it into &quot;people who think mainstream pornography is fine&quot; and &quot;those who think mainstream pornography has issues.&quot;<p>I guess what I feel is missing from the comments you&#x27;ve made so far is your personal attitude towards pornography. It&#x27;s easy for all of us to criticize this or that thinker, but it&#x27;s much harder (and more painful) to introspect and consider what our own attitudes say about us.<p>Let me volunteer to go first: I&#x27;ve consumed a great deal of pornography in the past, and it&#x27;s only this year that I stopped in earnest. Looking at pornography made me feel depressed, disconnected from my feelings, and I noticed that it made it hard for me to relate to women in my daily life. Not &#x27;hard to relate&#x27; like I couldn&#x27;t talk to them, but in that I felt uncomfortable talking to somebody as a human being when I&#x27;d just watched images that really degraded them.<p>Now, I was raised in a very liberal Scandinavian country, and my parents are far from prudes. Neither of my parents demonized sex, and growing up, they always said &quot;it&#x27;s okay if you do it, just make sure you use protection.&quot; So the discomfort I felt in looking at porn didn&#x27;t come from being raised in a moralistic, Bible-thumping household.<p>When I read Gail Dines book, I find my own thoughts reflected back to me. I find your label of &quot;shrill moralising&quot; somewhat offensive, but you may also be offended by some of the things that I am saying.<p>Also, and this is important to me, I think it&#x27;s very possible to get too rational about the whole discussion. You referenced &quot;rational sex negative critiques of porn.&quot; I am fine with logic and reason, but I often notice that people who focus too much on rational arguments are avoiding a frank discussion about their own emotions or the emotions of the women being discussed.<p>Anyway, if you&#x27;ve read this much, thank you.

I was a class tutor in the late 90s doing biology and electrical engineering classes. At this time the &#x27;can learn everything from a computer!&#x27; crowd was getting really underway, and I remember wondering &#x27;how is a computer going to teach you how tight to tie a liguture?&#x27;. Similarly, my favourite lecturer mentioned that for a lot of skills, a technical college is better. At university we might be expected to solder together a circuit, but zero time was spent teaching this skill. At a tech college, they do physical skills, starting with things like &quot;here&#x27;s a bunch of nails in a block of wood, solder wires across their heads&quot; - exercises solely for honing physical skills.<p>And if you are having trouble doing a physical skill, having an expert pair of eyes see what you&#x27;re doing is a hundred times better than trying to post it on a forum. For example, I&#x27;m an indifferent guitar player and have skimmed forums here and there for years, asking questions about this or that... but it was during my first lesson with a professional guitar teacher that I had considerable issues cleaned up with my technique.<p>MOOCs are a great tool to have in the arsenal, but they&#x27;re not a replacement technology.",1385436371

6798818,comment,6798297,6798678,3,0,bphogan,,,"I agree with you 100%.<p>I teach online and hybrid (part face to face, part online) courses. My students tell me they actively choose one or the other format. Some students cannot learn online and appreciate the ability to interact. I try to use the class time we have effectively, to demonstrate, to coach, to give feedback on their work. I save the &quot;lectures&quot; for their own time.<p>I&#x27;ve taken online courses from some pretty bright people and never felt that they were a good fit because they were simply lectures. I don&#x27;t learn by lecture. I learn by doing and getting feedback. I do horribly in &quot;traditional&quot; instructor-focused courses, AKA &quot;lecture/test&quot; courses. I do very well in courses where I can apply things.<p>One thing I think is great about online education is the ability to reach a lot of people. But one thing that&#x27;s terrible about it, in my humble opinion, is that it&#x27;s harder to connect with students. My online classes have a cap of 27 students. I can manage a couple of courses like that. But in order to manage courses of 200-2000 people, I just would be putting up content and videos, and I&#x27;m sorry, but that&#x27;s not teaching. That&#x27;s nothing different than screencasts or books. If I get assessed, I want detailed feedback. I want to ask questions.<p>And if those questions are being answered by a support staff, then there goes the argument of &quot;learning from the best and brightest&quot; that MOOCs advocate.<p>I love teaching students hundreds or thousands of miles away. I don&#x27;t think my role is going away any time soon, simply because I&#x27;ve evolved how I teach. The ones who should be worried are the ones who teach from the textbook and spend 64 hours per course lecturing from the front of the room.<p>[edit to clarify reply]",1385434829

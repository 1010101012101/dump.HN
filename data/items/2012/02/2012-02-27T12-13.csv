For the risk levels I took into account 
1) How recent the data was
2) What time of the day it occurred relative to the time of query (for eg: the crime occurred at 4pm on another day and its 5pm now, it will be given a higher weightage compared to something that happened at say, 11am.)
3) The severity of the crime itself (murders >> theft)
4) Number of occurrences of crimes in the area<p>The assignment of weights wasn't thoroughly scientific though. It needs some tweaking.<p>And thanks for the suggestion on push notifications :)",1330347560
3638786,comment,3637706,3638021,7,0,jonnathanson,,,"<i>""- Humane meat
- Painless meat
- Slaughterless meat
- Guiltless meat""</i><p>The problem with these names is that, subconsciously, they conjure up the very things you're trying to avoid. The term ""slaughterless"" calls to mind visions of slaughter. The word ""painless,"" especially in an unfamiliar context -- like that of food -- gives a queezy feeling in the pit of the stomach. (One thinks: ""Is this food going to hurt me?"") And the word ""humane"" is close enough to ""human"" to cause discomfort, even in people who are well aware of the difference between those words.<p>Far better, IMO, to go with phrasing that draws no attention to negatives. ""Sustainably raised,"" ""sustainably grown,"" or even just ""sustainable"" would be interesting choices. (Though even the word ""grown"" might evoke the wrong idea for a lot of consumers). This phrasing says ""green"" without implying ""Soylent Green."" Alternatively, you borrow a page from the tuna industry, who wisely chose ""dolphin-safe"" over the more psychologically onerous ""dolphin-free,"" and go with ""animal-safe"" or some variant thereof.<p>Of your suggestions, ""guiltless"" also seems pretty effective. I'm on the fence about ""pure,"" inasmuch as it forces the mind to wander to the meat's origins. Furthermore, it could backfire in a big way -- especially with the Christian crowd, who would see cultured meat as ""unnatural"" in comparison to traditional meat.",1330347525
3638785,comment,3638312,3638312,1,0,Gravityloss,,,"Hooray, in the end they can go to no pesky lens at all since image quality can be improved infinitely by adding more pixels. Using a pinhole does away with that focusing too. ;)<p>To be serious, I'm more of a physics guy. Photon ""shot"" (think shotgun with fewer and fewer pellets) noise determines already the lower limit of noise and (having a certain fixed shutter speed which is defined by avoiding movement) the only way you get more photons from the same subject is more lens area.<p>Maybe you can filter a little better if you have more pixels. I'd imagine the dynamic range sucks though if each pixel is so small that it saturates quickly.<p>So, if you're shopping for a camera, what determines how your photos come out in anything but the brightest sunlight is actually the lens. You should be shopping primarily for a good (read large aperture) lens, with a decent camera attached / bundled. Or if you want to go further, a system that is offering good lenses.",1330347482

They never touted .NET as a replacement for C++ for actual Windows apps and they never rewrote their apps (Office, etc) in .NET managed C#. In that area, .NET has been doing well.

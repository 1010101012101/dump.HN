431438,comment,428785,429598,0,0,ohxten,,,"One option is charity. Keep in mind that the government pulls in $1.2 trillion from personal income taxes per year (ironically enough, that's the size of Obama's proposed stimulus package).<p>Anyway, in a libertarian USA, most if not all of that $1.2 trillion would stay in the hands of the people; that fact, along with a few other libertarian ideals, would mean a more prosperous people.<p>A more prosperous people, with the knowledge that the government no longer provides inefficient health care to others with their hard-earned money means... you guessed it. Also, a libertarian USA would mean cheaper /everything/ (including health care) because of the Austrian economic, free-market principles.<p>I truly believe it. I've got some excellent ideas based around for-profit charities. Imagine famous, fancy restaraunts situated in the big cities. The bottom floor sells wonderful food to the celebrities and rich folks. The rest of the building houses and feeds homeless people. Of course, it doesn't even have to be a fancy restaraunt, and it doesn't have to house homeless people.",1231808287

I didn't unpack it, so it was ambiguous.<p>I'm not sure if the ""10,000"" reports would happen; have to try it and see. It's probably more like bug-reports, or 37signal's ""feature requests"" (that they read and throw out). And, if you fix the typo, the reports stop. :-) It's hard to judge, but I think you'd have to be massively popular to get even one or two typo reports. But I don't know: need to do the experiment.<p>Maybe a lower-cost solution would be just to add ""prompting"" text next to the comment box, something like: ""typo corrections are welcome"", to encourage people.<p>Typo reports (bug reports?) aren't that common: for example, I made a comment on a typo to Tim O'Reilly's recent blog - but no one else had.",1231808111

431415,comment,431285,431285,0,0,11ren,,,"I have a corollary to Greenspun's Tenth Law, which is that:<p><pre><code>  Lisp programmers see everything in terms of as an ad hoc,\n  informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Lisp,\n  and don't see other benefits it might have.\n  That is, Greenspun's Tenth Law is true - for Lisp programmers.\n</code></pre>\nI came to this conclusion because of a tragic pair of research papers, which had a fantastic usability idea. The second half of the first paper took the focus off the usability, and developed it into a very simple functional language. In their next paper, they dropped the fantastic usability idea completely, and made it into a lisp. :-(<p>Some XML standards fell into a similar trap, by wanting languages that process XML to be themselves written in XML - such as XSLT. It's a nice abstract concept to be able to process yourself... but at the price of abominations like ""i &lt; 10"".<p>Adam Bosworth pointed out that XML's XPath resisted this - by making XPath itself an embedded non-XML mini-language. Imagine an XML representation of path components - now <i>that</i> would be verbose!<p>In a politically expedient move, I'd like to point out that pg didn't fall into this trap: he made the DSL for users of Viaweb to customize their store to <i>not</i> be lisp (though an easily mapped subset, if I understand correctly.) It's a non-lisp mini-language.<p>Great link from the article, about ""principle of least power"", for mini-languages: <a href=""http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html#PLP"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html#PLP</a> Constraints are very empowering, because you know what to expect.<p>Regarding XML: I'd always thought it was just one of many possible syntaxes for representing hierarchical data; and it really didn't matter which syntax you used. As in a lingua franca (or any standard), provided that it is barely adequate, the key thing is that everyone agrees on it. XML became the Chosen, de facto standard, because everyone was already familiar with HTML, propelled by the mass adoption of the web. So the question becomes: why did we get HTML (based on SGML), instead of S-expressions? The article gives reasons, but I guess the short of it is that if a group of people work towards a specific purpose for years, and are successful at it (as SGML was), it is probably a good base to start from if you want to do something similar, i.e. describe documents.<p>Also, more directly, if I imagine a large webpage described with S-expressions, I think HTML is a bit clearer.<p>Nitpick: The article omits that quotes (or apostrophes) must be escaped in XML attributes.<p>Very telling points about LaTeX - that like XML/HTML, it also uses named end-tags; and that Lisp documentation itself is used LaTeX instead of S-expressions - drinking their kool-aid; but not eating their dog-food.",1231807177

They use this when they realize that if they don't do something unethical or completely brilliant, there will be a bottom line that little guy will have to deal with. He will be fired or they'll cut his hours, or they will give less health insurance and higher premiums and deductables, etc. Somehow the little guy is going to get cut so the irreplaceable CEO can go on a $600,000 necessary cruise that the little guy wasn't even invited to.\nLook at working in retail. It is a nightmare! There you are so replaceable, they can't keep positions filled for very long because people either  ""get themselves out of that situation"" or they remain humiliated and keep collecting a smaller check.\nThe only way to be truly irreplaceable is to CREATE something.

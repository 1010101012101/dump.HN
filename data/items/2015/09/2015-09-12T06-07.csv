I don&#x27;t think it can reach the speed of Jekyll since Babel is heavily used to convert the jsx to js at the start of the generation. If everyone wrote pure js React code, then the babel step would essentially be eliminated which should definitely be a config option.<p>Dropping at least a second or two should be easy. My code is a beautiful mess right now, and I know there&#x27;s so many parts I can improve, let alone also using the production version of React instead of the warning/error checking version.<p>Also, when I say 2 weeks, I actually meant more like 40 hours over the course of 2 weeks.

My impression is that &quot;deregulation&quot; in practice largely amounted to at best a decline in the <i>rate of increase</i> in federal regulations, not an overall decrease in total regulation. Today there are vastly more federal rules and regulations and also substantially more government employees as a percentage of total employment than there was in the 1970s.<p>Um, here&#x27;s a plot of one proxy for new regulations - the size of the federal register in pages:<p><a href=""http://politicalcalculations.blogspot.com/2012/07/the-regulation-of-american-people.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://politicalcalculations.blogspot.com/2012/07/the-regula...</a><p>There were several high-profile cases of actual deregulation (eg, regulations related to trucking and airline fares), but it amounted to pushing back the tide - the nature of government programs is to grow and most have continued to do so, occasional changes in fashionable rhetoric notwithstanding.",1442040742

It&#x27;s a lisp, which means homoiconic, i.e. build software just like Lego (different from non-lisps)<p>2. Immutability and purity in the core library + sane, managed concurrency via atoms, refs, core.async, i.e. write serious multithreaded code without putting your hair on fire; helps on the front-end via ClojureScript as well (different from most other Lisps)<p>3. The JVM, which means very good performance in the general case + build once, run everyone + a lot of libraries",1442037805

145587,comment,145245,145410,0,0,marvin,,,"It is possible today to create airplanes that use less energy per mile than a good car, traveling at higher speeds. I think PG's comment about government involvement is very relevant here - the reason such airplanes aren't the norm is bureaucracy, politics and law. Intellectual inertia.<p>The problem regarding personal air travel is almost purely political. The only real technical hurdle I can see is the problem of getting them into and out of the air: we haven't yet created airplanes that both are energy-efficient in the air and land or take off vertically. Tilt-rotor designs are the most promising candidate I can see for this (you need wings to travel cheaply), but they would have to be under computer control unless we want reckless pilots to die in droves while landing. The efficient planes I am talking about here don't need a mile of runway - 500 meters is plenty.<p>In case my first sentence draws criticism off the bat, please consider that there are four-seater, canard airplane designs that cruise at 170 mph at 5 gallons/hour = 34 MPG. And this is with today's airplane engine technology, which hasn't changed since the 1960s. The problems which then remain are infrastructure, training and inertia, which are purely political. I have confidence that we will eventually have personal flying vehicles (""flying cars""), but this shows that the problems faced are anything but technological in nature. People ridiculing the old notion of a near-term ""flying car"" are bashing the wrong people. Why do the scientists always get the blame when it's just cultural inertia that is the problem?",1206442244

Jessica Livingston says in ""Founders at Work"" that the common trait between the founders was determination. Maybe the best example that I can remember is Evan Williams who went through a lot before Blogger was successful (losing friends and more).<p>What has struck you guys as the best modern-day example of determination (it need not have turned out successful)?<p>Another good one was the guy the movie ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" was based off of (though I'm not sure how accurate that story was)",1206441783

We have plenty of resources to do this now, but it isn't happening because once wealth and capital get concentrated in individuals or groups of people it tends to just make them more wealth.<p>And the answer to the <i>why</i> is that I believe humans have a fundamental right to life.

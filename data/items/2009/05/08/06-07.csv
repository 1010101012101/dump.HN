599296,comment,599236,599236,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"IANAL, but it appears their argument is that you are exploiting their mark as part of the commercial service your website offers. It seems legally sloppy and you're correct about it not really being DMCA material, but I'm not so I'd go so far as abuse.<p>It is a given in trademark law that if a mark is not aggressively defended by the owner then they have only themselves to blame if it is later misappropriated. Trademarks don't enjoy the same absolute protections as copyrights do. They don't want to dilute the <i>secondary meaning</i> of the trademark, which might (theoretically) happen if they let you keep giving it out at your site.",1241764709

Can't speak for shows in non-English speaking countries, but I'm sure we all have shows like this one in our respective countries of residence. I've watched BBC Panorama episodes this year that are just as biased & fear-mongering for example. If you want serious American documentaries, sample PBS's Frontline or NOVA series (via file-sharing =]) before jumping to conclusions.",1241764641
599294,comment,598523,599137,0,0,__,,,"Sorry, I wasn't denying that Texas spends more money per capita on textbooks. As you point out, it certainly does, according to the article.<p>I was worried that someone might read that Texas's per-capita spending is higher than California's and draw the conclusion that this is a big reason for why California's schools suck. I've heard a lot of people make arguments like that. ""Small Country X spends so much more per capita on Y! (<i>Implied:</i> That must be why Y sucks for us, and our lives would be better if our country would spend more on it.)""<p>So I gave one reason why the returns California and Texas get from their respective textbook purchases are probably not proportional to their per-capita budgets.",1241764622

At the end of the summer, I returned it and went back to my old plain flip-phone which does nothing but phonecalls and text messages.<p>The only thing I find I miss about the blackberry is the ability to look things up online while I'm on the road.

I used to develop palm-based apps about 6-7 years ago, and enjoyed it.  I always liked the simplicity of the palm interface, and while it's fully dated now, it's holding me over until the Pre comes out.<p>I tried a WinMo phone with a slide-out keyboard about two years ago and found it fully awful, and switched back to my 700p (to wait until the 755 was released).<p>I was one of the many who was assuming Palm was going to fail before it released it's new OS.

599275,comment,598523,599202,0,0,gustavo_duarte,,,"Good point. I agree with your take on the trade offs, but it then becomes a matter of deciding how good or bad things really are. Since this applies beyond textbooks to the wider issue of school choice, I'll say 'school' below but 'textbook' holds similarly.<p>I think in the current system the vast majority of students get a raw deal in the form of mediocrity. Most large public schools I've seen are the educational equivalent to a Dilbertesque corporation. We adults have many ways to dodge cubicle land, but the kids don't. That's a tragedy.<p>Independent schools would be better to a sizable portion of the kids and about the same for the rest. It's true that we would find faults in each other's schools (school X is godless, school Y teaches creationism), but I think that: 1) it's a fair choice for parents to make, and 2) the current schools have a limited role in that type of outcome anyway.<p>I understand there are drawbacks and that this is a minority view which voters find unpalatable. But after visiting several public schools in the US and in Brazil and thinking endlessly about the topic, it's the conclusion I've reached.<p>(I apologize if this sort of political discussion is discouraged here on HN, I started posting recently and am learning the ropes.)",1241762717

You'd research the forums in that area and contribute to them. Find open source projects in your area. I would even go as far as to suggest doing a masters degree part-time in that same field.  After a while, you start noticing the same people and companies popping up in multiple places.  You build contacts with them. You build up a profile of the sorts of companies that do stuff in your area and then you actively seek out others like them.<p>Yes, as many others have said, you are a brand and that requires persistent marketing and selling activities.

Good question.<p>Honestly, and I don't meant to stereotype here, but I think it's because the quality of PHP developer proportionate to the number of PHP developers on github is higher than in other languages.  Granted, their are fewer total.  But the reason for this is pretty simple.  PHP is not the popular language, so most new developers taking up programming in the past 2-3 years see a different landscape then a decade ago.  Github is SourceForge and Ruby is PHP.  Poor PHP developers aren't flocking to github.  They are still on SourceForge (not suggesting that all SF users are bad).<p>Basically, the PHP developer's on github are probably the more experience developers that have been doing this for a while.  On the flip side, most Ruby developer's are still comparatively new to the language.<p>This is a lot of assuming, and I don't mean to disparage anyone.<p>That all being said, while I equated the quality of the programmer with the amount of swearing being done, I fully realize it's not a fair comparison.  Granted, this entire thing is based on numbers that, I feel, are fairly meaningless.<p>Finally, what I find more interesting is how HN's quality takes a nose dive when the population is allowed to bash a particular population: in this case, people who enjoy using PHP.<p>Still, good follow up. =)",1298418312

I was just curious because the more time you have up front, the easier it's going to be to get the time off without unnecessary friction. Hypothetically, if I were a manager and one of my reports told me ""hey, I'm having a baby next Tuesday - can I have two weeks off?"" I'd be pretty teed off. I left my last job partly due to a lack of understanding over what my wife's pregnancy meant for my ability to work the same hours as the rest of the team (I was the only one with a kid and nobody understood why it's important for me to go to OB/GYN appointments). Don't put yourself in that situation.<p>Tell your boss early and remind him/her often that there is a baby on the way and you're going to need this time off. The only way you can screw this up is by springing a huge surprise on your boss like the hypothetical above.<p>Good luck and congratulations on the baby!",1298417925

Also, I prefer that my reading device is not heavy and that it is small enough to read while on standing on public transportation -- this way I can get heads up on things before arriving to work.<p>2. The ability to annotate documents directly using finger input is amazing (I am not talking about handwriting -- I am talking about yellow-highlighting passages and keywords without using the classic trackpad and cursor combo which requires a stable platform for it to be usable).<p>3. The ability to just take the PDF/document/notes/whatever and bring it over to my boss next door is irreplaceable. Laptop is too heavy and cumbersome to hold with one hand, and email/file-sharing is cumbersome as well -- bosses are generally unwilling to listen to their subordinates tell them to open this or that file while they are in the middle of something on their screen. This is why most offices have stuck with paper for so long -- it is great to be able to carry something in your hand and just show it to somebody across the floor.

2252105,comment,2250526,2250526,0,0,jmcc,,,"Interesting discussion here.  I've also been working on a remote jobs website: <a href=""http://WheresTheRemote.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://WheresTheRemote.com/</a>.  I've had the idea for years, but it ""opened for business"" last year.  I've considered many of the issues raised here.<p>It's definitely a chicken and egg problem.  Allowing free ads might help get the ball rolling, but I've resisted that since I'm concerned it will lead to low quality, which is one of the problems I have with other job sites.  I don't want to hurt the site's reputation right out of the gate.<p>Moderation is one way to address that, but one of the core ideas of my site, which I think sets it apart from a lot of other job sites, is to require advertisers to include rate of compensation in their ads, and encourage accuracy by basing the fee for posting the ad on the advertised rate.<p>Trying to charge for something like this right off the bat without a lot of traffic is a difficult proposition, in my experience.  But people seem to be willing to use mediocre web services and job sites, so allowing free ads to begin with, even if it results in low quality ads, might be a more realistic way to get something like this started.<p>So far I haven't compromised any of the original ideas for my site, but it hasn't gotten any traction either.  I hoped that offering a money back guarantee would encourage a few advertisers to give it a shot and get the ball rolling, but so far that hasn't been enough.  It's also difficult to figure out where / how to advertise something like this to even reach the right audience and make potential advertisers aware of it, at least without spending a ton.<p>If I'd known that all it takes to get people to start advertising jobs is to post the site on Hacker News, I would have done that months ago!  I suspect that the activity on remote-jobs.com also has to do with the coupon offer though.<p>I'm considering making some changes to my site to get the ball rolling and then start charging or return to the original ideas for the site if and when there's enough traffic, as some have suggested.  I don't think there's anything greedy about charging for such a service.  If people are willing to pay it right off the bat, great, if not, that's another story.  It might be more realistic to not charge or charge a small fee at first, and I agree that even charging a small fee would help to weed out the worst kind of posters who have free reign on some other sites.<p>I have problems with all of the job sites I've seen and the goal of my site is also to provide a better venue for finding remote jobs, and to try to level the playing field for job seekers, e.g. by requiring rate information in ads, backing that up with the fee structure, limiting the time ads are displayed moreso than most sites to reduce the opportunity for lazy or busy advertisers to waste job seekers' time with stale ads, etc.",1298417552

If you use any of these services, you'll feel right at home:  Instapaper, Read It Later, Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Posterous, Delicious, Pinboard, Zootool, Evernote, and Google Reader. Sharing any content to such services takes no effort, be it links, images or text.<p>Don't like to share things? You're welcome to use the built-in scratchpad to store notes and ideas collected when you're browsing. Even TextExpander and Markdown syntax support are included so that you can quickly jot stuff down.<p>Use OmniFocus, Pastebot and/or Delibar? Cyberspace supports sending content to them, too.<p>3/ Cyberspace is COOL. DuckDuckGo is its default search engine, and Cyberspace automatically gives you !bang syntax suggestions as you type your address. You can also tap-and-hold any text and select Learn more to get Zero-click info from DuckDuckGo.<p>Cyberspace uses tags to manage your bookmarks. Import your Delicious or Pinboard bookmarks into the app and it will let you browse everything by tags. Oh, and you can tap-and-hold on any bookmarklet to add it to your Bookmarks, too.<p>If you have an Instapaper subscription account, you can access your unread items right within Cyberspace.<p>Cyberspace is also the first web browser comes with full TextExpander support and 'Bump to share' feature to quickly share links between your iOS devices.<p>4/...<p>5/...<p>The feature list goes on and on.

This is a mainstream marketing method that does not appeal to their audience. By avoiding it, they increase their appeal to their true fans, while ignoring uninterested listeners. Likewise, the singer Adele does not perform at music festivals for the same reason.<p>The ideal niche product would repel exactly half the critics and attract the other half. This would create a core of hardcore evangelists, a bigger group of fans, a big group of uninterested bystanders and a small group of haters. The haters and bystanders can mostly be ignored, making marketing super-efficient.<p>Lack of polarization is a measure of beauty and popularity. Beauty is a measure of average-ness and normality. The most beautiful person in a given society is the one that looks the most an average of all the people. The most popular movie is the one that everyone can relate to.. the most profoundly average.<p>Case in point.. the Shawshank Redemption. This is a movie that is consistently voted one of the best ever made, but it's highly rated because of its familiarity. It's a near flawless execution of common mythologies that everyone can relate to: fall from grace, redemption, justice, freedom and so on.<p>Toy Story is another example. Pixar's entire methodology is to distill the world's archetypes and mythologies down into the ""perfect"" movie with every ""i"" dotted and every ""t"" crossed. The result is profoundly familiar, yet kept fresh with just enough plot twists and humour to keep it interesting.<p>Niche movies are just popular movies for specific groups instead of a general audience. Polarization is a measure of how effectively they achieved the goal.",1298416954

You'll need time to recuperate from the delivery and get used to having the baby in the house. You'll find however, the first few weeks are easier than you expect: You have family around to help out and for the first few weeks, newborns sleep more and fuss much less than they will in about 3 weeks to a month.<p>- Save the rest of your time off for when your family leaves. This is the best advice I can give any soon to be parent. Firstly, with the family gone, you'll have to deal with the baby on your own for the first time, and it becomes much more of an ordeal with only two people (and one of those people still recovering from delivery.) Secondly, in a cruel trick of nature, typically around the time your family leaves you alone, the baby starts to become much more active and goes for shorter periods between feeding. Unless you are really lucky (your baby sleeps for longer than 2-3 hours or the mom agrees to do all night work and you're able to sleep through it) you will not be getting very much sleep, and it will take some time to get used to being so sleep deprived.<p>It may sound like strange advice, but you're far better off taking the lions share of the time off a month after the baby comes. The mom will appreciate the support you'll be able to give in the most difficult period of new parenthood. If you take all the time off up front it will probably wind up harder on your family.",1298416601

I want to agree that our group will be allowed to set its own rules to some degree in terms of working environment."" And give a few examples. No need to push it or make this legally binding, or even put it in writing.<p>Then, when the timesheet dude shows up (which they will), just say no. When the meetings are being called, say no. It'll be a shitstorm, and lots of people will dislike you for getting away with it, but you should get your way if this happens soon after the acquisition (when someone way up stands behind the acquisition and can't have it go bad this early.) Let the shitstorm happen, and stand tall. I don't think any company would fire founders of a company they acquired a month or two ago.<p>I don't know, anyone know of cases where it happened this way?

Experience seems to have most enduring value in people and business-related skills, more than in programming. Other things that don't change much are laws and mathematics. Although this doesn't help mathematicians, who need to be creating  new mathematics, my guess is that applied mathematicians would get better over time.",1298415760

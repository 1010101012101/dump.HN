(The limit works out so you can still take off.)<p>The less obvious and more important factor is stall speed of an aircraft = takeoff speed, but because of ground effects you can lift the wheels off the ground below take off speed.

I want to check the same list of RSS feeds at home. 
I also want my email to all be synced properly, even the ones from that old POP3 server that doesn't support IMAP.
I want my bookmarks, and browser history to sync, as well as my saved passwords. 
I want to pause the song I'm listening to in my office, hop in my car, and press Play again, then finish the playlist at home on my stereo.<p>All of these things have solutions now.. Dropbox, Weave, IMAP, etc.. But they're all disparate solutions. I'd pay money to have one solution that just worked. That let me keep my workflow online, rather than having to break it up.

(ie, roll forward).<p>Your argument suggests that if the aircraft was attached to the ground with steel beams it would somehow break free into glorious flight. It would not.<p>The treadmill removes the ability of the aircraft to achieve correct airspeed, regardless of whether it is powered by prop, jet or ion engine.<p>Any assumption that the aircraft can move forward is predicated on the fact that the treadmill cannot match the engine's output. This is accurate, but like I said, outside of the scope of the problem.<p>Try this:<p>1. Aircraft has floats, not wheels.
2. Aircraft's normal take off speed is 100 kts. Let's say the engine can produce a take off speed of 100kts at 2000rpm.
3. Aircraft is on a river moving the opposite direction at 50kts.<p>Q: Will the engine be able to achieve the required 100kts airspeed at 2000rpm? If not, if I can somehow match the river to the airspeed, is it not sound theory that I can prevent the aircraft from <i>ever</i> reaching that 100kts take off speed?",1248713332

An organisation with several sites and teams spread across locations and timezones will tend to use a wiki. But wikis are not fabulous for the editing experience. They're OK, but users keep steering towards Microsoft Word because they like the desktop-feel editing experience far more.<p>Alas, Word sucks because it only runs on Windows, it's expensive, it's lock-in, it uses pessimistic locking (if a user has it open, another can't open it to edit - fabulous when your colleague leaves it open over a weekend), and because its formatting is too flexible. Word documents degrade to the level of your least competent staff member.<p>These libraries appear to offer a decent foundation for writing a desktop-oriented rich text editor that gives a Word-like editing experience but which mandates styles and integrates with an arbitrary remote system and stuff like that.<p>That's what I saw in it, anyway.

Air flowing over the and under the wings creates different pressure; hence, lift. There is a magic speed for each aircraft that over which the lift will be sufficient to move the entire aircraft vertically. For a 747, this is 180 mph/290 km/h at 80,000 lbs. That's pretty fucking fast.<p>Any movement relative to the ground that is under that speed will not result in flight. This is true even if the aircraft is actually in the air.<p>If, as the problem states, the treadmill can equal the forward thrust of the engines, no lift will be produced by the wings, ergo, it will stay right where it is.<p>This is why aircraft have an airspeed and a ground speed. It's also why stalling is a major concern.<p>EDIT: the fact that finding a treadmill that can act in a manner as suggested by the problem is impossible is another issue completely.<p>EDIT 2: Think people: They have breaks on aircraft wheels do they not? (They do) You can sit on a runway with the engine revved equal to your break ability and <i>not move</i>. If the engine in the problem can outperform the treadmill, you've solved a different problem.",1248711912

You have to use the OS for some time to understand this.

The fact that they have polished the UI does not mean that that is the only thing they did.<p>As an aside, I also wanted to try out Ubuntu in the past few years, but did not get time for that.

It had been passed off to me with the description of ""there are three things left to do, do you think you can do them and launch at the end of the week?""<p>Of course, three more things popped up every week and the project slipped by months. I spent the entire project feeling guilty. Then one friday it dawned on me that there was a world of un-finished requirements that had never been captured. I had never done anything ""manager-y"" so I went to Borders, bought Rapid Development by Steve McConnell, and read it over the weekend.<p>When I showed up that Monday, instead of getting to work on the ""last remaining three things,"" I hid out in an abandoned office and started specing and estimating the remaining parts of the project. Then I went to my managers with a full re-estimation that was months out. Of course, they weren't happy with the projection, but having data gave me the back-bone to stick with it.<p>Until that point I had thought my career was entirely dependent on being smarter, on developing programming chops like the gurus that I read about on Slashdot. Afterward I thought of it as being extremely dependent on what I consider ""personality traits"" but which seem to be trainable. For example, the initiative to fix something that's broken rather than just complaining about the status quo, or the calmness to stick to my guns without taking it personally that the people around me were wrong.",1248711539

Foreign students, however, are normally not permitted to work in the US except for 12 months (29 months if you're doing sci / tech / engineering / math). This is called Curricular Practical Training if you're still in uni doing a co-op or summer internship and Optional Practical Training if you're doing it after.<p>I'm a foreign student in the US, and what most of my fellow foreign students can do to work long-term in the US after graduation is to get an H-1B visa. This is basically a way for companies in the US to be able to hire foreign workers in specialized job areas.<p>The article says it ""requires only a bachelor's degree"". While this is true, the process is much more painful that you can imagine. Companies shy away from selecting foreign students, but not because they're bigoted or prejudiced: It's the amount of red tape involved. I've seen lots of companies explicitly say that they are not considering foreign students (I don't blame them).<p>When getting an H-1B, you can't just apply for one and then find a job. You need to find a company that wants to go through the H-1B process with you. And then your Visa is only valid while you work for that same company. If you quit, you'll need to go through the whole process again.<p>I can see why the US doesn't want to let in tons of people but then again, a good amount of these people are at the very least moderately skilled. Since the barrier for entry is already high, it would be cool if at least the H-1B wasn't so restrictive about what happens after you get it so H-1B workers wouldn't be stuck at jobs where they're unhappy or they could easily be entrepreneurs.",1248711497

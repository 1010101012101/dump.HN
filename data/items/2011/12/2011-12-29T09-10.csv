They think that the suggestion that a piece of software which says ""Released under the GPL"" in the source code and similar things in the about box is in fact released under the GPL is surprising?<p>Then it goes on: ""I think that doesn't mean much because saying ""the GPL"" doesn't really identify ""the GNU General Public License version 2"" as specifically as a copyright notice should.""<p>A very strange argument.  Are they really claiming that the author purposely wrote that it was released under ""the GPL"", but was referring to a <i>different</i> GPL (and never mentioned it)?  Or is he trying to say that by keeping the language ambiguous, he can retroactively change the intention?<p>I'm not sure whether to interpret all this as ineptitude, stubbornness or deception.<p>Look, it is quite clear that they did not release it under the GPL, I'm not contesting that.

In two striking, contrarian intelligence briefs released on the Internet on Jan. 5 and Jan. 6, Stratfor argued that Saddam's lightning restructuring of the Iraqi military, followed by executions of the army's Third Corps commanders, was evidence that the coup had been suppressed.

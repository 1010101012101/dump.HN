Researchers noticed that people, for example, running, and people observing running, have similar brain activity. Why might that be? Well, they say that certain neurons somehow mimic what one observes. They imply these neurons are somewhat autonomous.<p>But there's another rather obvious possibility: the person running, and the person watching running, were both thinking about running. Their brain activity was similar because they were thinking about the same thing.",1213678628

It's theorized that sometimes these deficient mirror neurons get replaced by other skills and pre-sensory processing, like logic, music, perfect pitch, etc, in the same way that some blind people have phenomenal hearing.<p>Also it's debilitating for a lot of people, many of whom lack so many mirror neurons they never learn how to communicate.",1213678346

Obviously you probably don't want to tell your son that, but as gojomo cautions, you might not want to praise him for it, either.  (Edit: That is, if you do offer praise/encouragement, you'll want to do so in a way that avoids giving him false hopes that his number will become the next googol.)<p>The thing is, simply naming a number isn't a great achievement, not even on the part of the mathematician's nephew who came up with 'googol'.  It makes for an interesting story, but the thought processes involved are about as relevant to thinking mathematically as naming a pet dog is to understanding canine biology.  But the initiative to name things is certainly valuable, and well worth reinforcing.<p>The trick here is to lead your son towards an interest in the properties of numbers and away from any potential delusions of grandeur dependent on being the next 'googol' kid.

219392,comment,218854,219042,0,0,iamdave,,,"Actually, if I'm not completely mistaken this is a rather cool site function, so correct me if I'm wrong, but does this site scrape the sites listed on the main page for the tags you search for then produce a results page?<p>I think that's what it's doing, and if so that's pretty neat.  It's a great way if you're doing a research project for example to gather social data in one location based on tags instead of going to each individual website finding what you're looking for.<p>As far as critique goes:<p>I can't say much by way of development since I'm the design ninja on my team.  We'll start there:<p>On the front page I'd make the search function much more prominent since that is the central component to the reason your site exists.  For the most part, the idea is great but the execution lacks in placement of your design elements.  For example, again on the front page instead of listing all of the sites being scraped, put them on an about page or somewhere out of the way, but still easily accessible so users will know where data is coming from.  Your banner should go up top, in tried and tested results from many other sites similar to this.<p>Secondly, on the search results, I wouldn't overemphasize the ability to refine the search results by way of a tag cloud.  perhaps using a secondary form element so users can define themselves what details they want to disseminate, and making the tag cloud a secondary matter.  But most importantly, on the matter of search results: those should be obvious; don't make the user scroll after rendering the data they've searched for.  This is both redundant and pointless.<p>Thirdly I'm noticing you're making extraneous use of line-height properties.  Don't overdo it.  I know your copytext is a little sparse, and that's fine but don't sacrifice real estate on the page that could be used on it's own page just to make a point.<p>Overall, I would reduce the front page to maybe just the banner, and the search form (just like Google and even the Twitter search App Summize), with links at the bottom to your blog, contact and about pages, as you have now.  Make your results page more readable and more relevant to the information being presented, and utilize screen space more effectively by reconsidering where some of your content elements are.<p>But, for what it's worth I think this is a great idea for a site, the design isn't bad.  I can see you know how to do it, now just work on how to make it work for the user.  Just because you know how to navigate doesn't mean the rest of us do.<p>:) Good luck, and keep reading this thread.  There have been some great suggestions so far from the rest of the community.",1213675649

At your competitors site, I clicked on the pretty bookworm's pic.<p>3. Sort the pictures with a female bias (I'm guessing they're the target), rather than by ""new members"". You'll get more women <i>and</i> men.<p>4. Sort books by popularity of discussion rather than ""newness"". Draw people into the discussion.<p>5. The design doesn't feel friendly. Again, assuming women are your demographic make the site ""warmer"".<p>Goodreads is one competitor, how will you distinguish yourself?<p>Finding this problem was easy, implementing the solution the right way is much harder. Right on, with the FB integration.",1213675430

One of the difficulties with something like this is that everyone's installation is a little bit different.<p>You can try 0.5.4, which takes LOG_PATH + LOG_FILE literally.

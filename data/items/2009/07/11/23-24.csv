You could even charge a few bucks for it.<p>Let fans play their own instruments, re-mix, and upload.  Have a contest for the best interpretation.<p>Doing it for all the tracks might help offset your drummer's aversion to the idea.",1247356792

699617,comment,699604,699604,0,0,boryas,,,"The UI is super slick. In that regard, I would say I like it better than something like Adobe's form Designer.<p>I would suggest trying to add more objects, like tables and such to make it easier for people to make the form they want. Maybe something like an option to make custom objects made of other objects? Also, being able to fill the form from existing data is useful too. If someone wants a form that dynamically grow depending on how much input there is, I'm not sure how PDFAmigo handles that, if at all. For instance something like an order form, where a user would want to be able to order 1 thing or 100 different things (which could mean multiple pages, etc...)<p>With all that said, this is a really nice polished product, and the interface you have so far is a pleasure to use, great job!",1247356593

Organizations need to realize that this is the same for all great individuals, hackers or otherwise.  The type of people ISVs like SourceGear need for success is probably different from the type needed by YCombinator startups.",1247356146

The people in this video are probably quite adept at getting around online, but have no idea how it actually works.<p>Many people refer to the address bar as their ""google bar."" I've heard seen this in several customer service e-mails.<p>They may well be predicting the future.  Google has combined web address and search into one box, and with Wave they're bringing IM and e-mail under the same roof.",1247355990

699611,comment,699522,699522,0,0,webwright,,,"A document to synch up vision and goals between partners doesn't look very much like the standard business plan (or what's been proposed so far here).<p>With partners you should have a mutual understanding of:<p>- Risk tolerance.  How much of their own money will they spend?  How long will they go without a paycheck?  How cheaply can they live?<p>- Contribution.  How much time/money will each partner contribute?<p>- Equity.  Who owns what?  I'm a huge proponent of getting equal partners.  If they don't deserve an equal share, punt 'em and find someone who does.<p>- Vesting.  How long will it take before everyone owns their share (should be 2-3 years - you don't want someone quitting early and leaving with 33% of your companies stock)<p>- Goals.  Do you want to build a happy little income producing side project?  Or a monster business?  Or do you want to change the world?<p>- How to leave, gracefully.  There should be a written agreement that has rules for when a partner leaves voluntarily, or when two partners want to push out a third.  It's a lot easier to write this down NOW than when your company is worth $10m.<p>- What you're building, who you're building it for, and how flexible you are on the idea.  Ideas change, a lot.  You should be passionate about the same things.<p>- Authority.  Does anyone have it on design decisions?  Code decisions?  fundraising decisions?<p>- Horizon.  How long are you committing to the project before you punt it or pivot to a different idea?<p>In terms of business plans, it's a great exercise to discuss stuff like development process, roles, sales/marketing, pricing, etc.  But don't spend any more time writing the document than you HAVE to to get a shared understanding.  99% of the value is the process-- they usually collect dust once they are written.",1247355725

Frankly, I am feeling quite nervous submitting this for public scrutiny. At the same time I believe it's at a stage where user feedback is crucial both for fixing bugs and determining where to go from here.<p>I have tried to test the app with FF3.0/3.5, IE 7 and Safari 3/4. If you are using other browsers I'd love to hear about your experience. Honestly, I am not very optimistic about IE6.<p>Eventually, this is something I'd like to charge for. What are your thoughts on that? Would you pay a few bucks per form? Do you think a subscription model would work better? I am all ears.<p>Many thanks in advance.",1247354173

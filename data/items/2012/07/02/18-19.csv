Hey, if you believe the web PHP is dead, Java is dead, C is dead.. etc... Technologies, patterns, languages or structures don't die, in fact, if you really fancy you could write your application using C code and compiling it into asm, why not? If it works, perfect! There are enough examples out there where old technologie works. And I think people tend to be spending too much time thinking why something is imperfect, or how to do it better, instead of actually making stuff that rocks.<p>If you really do have the need to improve something, prove it! Make a useable example, write a framework, library or new language if you really need to.",1341255569

4190333,comment,4189082,4190150,4,0,tikhonj,,,"If you take this pattern and generalize it to having <i>arbitrary</i> behavior between each function call, you basically have monads where the [foo,bar,baz,quux] bit sort of acts like do notation in Haskell. The exact details might not be entirely the same, but it <i>is</i> exactly the same idea: you can control how a bunch of functions get composed.<p>So you'd have code that looks just like yours, but depending on which ""monad instance"" you parametrize it with, it could have different behavior. So you could uniformly represent code that could return null, code that could have multiple results or even parser code. And, very importantly, you could write other functions that act over <i>all</i> these different behaviors. So you could implement a reduceM function that would support a reducer that could return null, or one that could return many elements, or plenty of other possible behaviors in a uniform way.",1341255559

You don't know that impersonation isn't something a creative commons license on a photo from wikipedia was made for ? Do they have the right to create a substitutive persona to establish contacts with others ? Was there a change to the law and no one sent the memo or something...  Differentiation is intrinsic to identity, you don't have to display it like a onus. What are you on about ? So a bot with your name on it, that would tweet ""comments"" on the weather and caviar, would render you non existant, voiding of the hability to contest impersonation ?\nThat just has that touch of the same non sensical dribble that funnyjunk lawyer has, where are you going with that.<p>Natural rights cease because someone made a bot ? Whisky Tango Foxtrot. Hold the internet presses people.<p>""By what virtue does he own those rights?""<p>Maybe because when he signed up for the service he had those rights then and didn't give them away. Yeah, probably because of that.\nPeople accept terms of service when signing up to online services by their own predisposition and free will. They enter a contract, see where this is going. Bots that impersonate people that accept terms of service don't have precedence just because some pseudo experimental trio thought it would be a good project. They don't own his rights. That is the framing that causes the problem and why they are at fault when trying to turn the discussion to some indefensible position. They failed miserably at it.<p>That halloween criminal's holiday day... honestly, if you had to go make an account just to sprinkle this conversation with that piece of golden web dust/insight, you should have saved yourself the trouble. Honestly there are other places for that sort of thing. In the end it is really funny how people botching a project make this sort of thing pop up.

He correctly realized that the deflation being experienced in the US was bad, but he thought that artificially increasing prices would fix things, but in reality people didn't have the money to pay the new, higher, prices and all of FDR's efforts to raise the prices of things (the NRA especially) just ended up making the depression worse.<p>Now, FDR did a lot of things and some of them worked pretty well.

4190252,comment,4189811,4189811,0,0,drostie,,,"If your controller has too much logic you should really consider putting more of it in your model and view.<p>Maybe I don't understand MVC, and you all can tell me How Wrong I Am, but here's how I understand MVC at present:<p>Your Model is a public API, a Service Gateway -- and it should do a couple of things in principle. The first is that it should be able to manage a list of subscribed view/controllers, and push updates out to them -- this was difficult with Web 2.0 but we're now moving to systems where this is considered normal. The second is that it should define a set of API commands which change that state and push out those subscriptions.  That second bit is crucial, it's the difference between writing assembly and Python. If you have logic in your controller then it's probably because your model does not expose certain high-level concepts which your controller would use directly, so you're taking data from the model and building a higher-order model in your controller, before you operate on it.<p>It helps me to remember that in Smalltalk the idea was to always have <view|controller> pairs. They were always the same object split in two; each view had its own controller and vice versa. The controller is supposed to be input-oriented and the view is supposed to be output-oriented; the model says ""hey, X changed"" and the view updates what X looks like; the user clicks on X and the controller sends a signal to the view to change some more, the user erases X and the controller sends this request to the model, which will update the view when the request is complete.<p>Viewed this way it's really hard to see what the difference is supposed to be between MVC and MOVE. Clearly the messages in MVC are the Events in MOVE. Most of the controller logic has been pushed into the View, which should now handle input actions. Data cannot be dynamically pushed from the Model to the View because this is of course a Web 2.0 technology (pre-cometcasting, pre-websockets). The Operation sits in a grey area, implementing higher-order abstractions from the lower-order model.<p>Maybe we could do better with a hybrid, because the idea of decoupling subscriptions from the public API might actually be a good idea, in line with the Clojure philosophy that things should be de-complected into their simplest representations. But if I understand MVC right, then I don't see why you've got all your business logic in your controller. Heck, the View is supposed to be client-side, why isn't your Controller client side? Or if it is, and you have all this business logic in it, why are you trusting the client to do your business logic? Your gripes with MVC don't make sense to me.",1341254704

Existing sites on the web are shockingly complex to find a way to play against people you already have means of contacting.<p>At the time of this writing, weve got 5 games: Checkers, Chess, Four-in-a-Row, Reversi and WordBase.<p>Features:<p>- Each room has a unique url - share it via email, Facebook, Twitter, Google chat, or text message, it makes no difference to us. Theres no need to coordinate navigation to the same server, just to play a game. Just share the url.<p>- Play anonymously- you can play on our site without registering. If you want to, you can register to keep track of your records, get alerts when its your turn or something else interesting happens in your games.<p>- Real time updates. When your opponent makes a move / chats, youll see it right away without refreshing.<p>- Come back to your game later. If you register for an account, you can resume your game from a different device. Play from your phone, desktop, tablet, whatever. If you don't register, this doesn't work - we can't keep track of your games if we don't know who you are.<p>- No plugins required. BreakBase works on HTML5 / Javascript. No Flash / Java needed.<p>- WordBase supports up to 4 players.<p>- Get smart notifications via email or Twitter, and via the browser. Registered accounts only.<p>The stack:<p>- Main web app built on Pylons.<p>- Our Comet/push layer is built using Node.js, as the glue between ZeroMQ and Socket.io.<p>- We use MongoDB because its web scale.<p>The future: These are being actively worked on, and will be released in the near future:<p>- Planning more games. Currently considering Backgammon, War strategy games, or card games. Open (and eager) to suggestions<p>- Challenges. Challenge someone to a game directly from their profile.<p>- Mobile support. As of right now, you can make moves on Android / iOS devices by just going to breakbase.com in the browser, but wed obviously like to provide a tailored experience for smaller screens.<p>What would it take to get you to use this on a regular basis?",1341254663

An Action, in our parlance, is similar to the Command pattern from the Gang of Four. It can be invoked from anywhere and performs a single state change on a single model, or even multiple models (if several need to be updated at the same time, in the same transaction).<p>Separating Actions from Models was a huge step in writing readable code, and it's immediately clear what is happening in the system at any given time. Any Action can invoke any number of ""child"" actions, as well, to maintain encapsulation. For example: when a user registers on the site, we trigger a RegisterUser action, which in turn calls a CreateUser action and a LoginUser action.<p>Basically, we took any complicated method on our models and turned them into Action classes. Common concepts like database transactions, logging, event tracking, and so forth, can now be abstracted away, and don't need to be re-implemented in each model class. It's a huge productivity increase and a real win for software engineering.<p>I highly recommend this general approach to any large software system, and I'm grateful that we're all experimenting with things beyond MVC.",1341254110

I know Latin quite well, but that's not going to get me very far either. I'm quite hesitant to pick up a fourth language atop all the other things I know I need to do, so for the time being we're limiting ourselves to English.<p>Second, they're both developed countries. I have a family, and I have a responsibility to ensure that they're in a relatively safe environment with access to the same quality of life they're used to here. I also need to be able to have relatively easy access to a technical job market. I could likely get a job working remotely, but it's much easier to know that I can get an actual job if push comes to shove.<p>Third, and perhaps most subjectively: they're closer to the parts of the world we find interesting and exciting. My wife is terribly interested in Japan, for instance, which is easier to visit from Oceania than from America (no time zone change). If I moved to Germany, for instance, I'm close to most of Europe. However, I have virtually no interest in travelling around Europe. I'm much more interested in visiting Southeast Asia, for example, or other places that are somewhat off the beaten track. This is entirely subjective, as I noted above, but it's a fact that needs to be kept in mind: we're discussing where bartonfink wants to live, not where every person on earth should live.<p>When it comes to choosing between Australia and New Zealand, my wife and I keep changing our minds. Australia certainly has a stronger job market and larger cities with all they bring, but New Zealand seems to have a more laid-back culture that suits both of us very well. Further, from what I've heard, life in New Zealand is cheaper than life in Australia, so some of our other dreams (e.g. a beachfront house) would be a little more approachable. That said, I think we need to get the hell down there and actually visit before too long.<p>As I said above, if Atlassian wrote me an e-mail next week and said ""Barton, we dig what you do - can we pay for you to move out to Sydney by Christmas?"" I'd be hard-pressed to turn that down. I'd probably need Mapquest to double my salary to push aside an opportunity like that, and it's not because I dislike Mapquest or am underpaid or anything: it's that moving abroad is very important to me because I want to feel like I live in a country because I choose to live there and not because I happened to be born there.

There are actually multiple processes involved, and each has its own MVC.<p>The big epiphany for me was when I realized that the server has its own MVC, and the browser has its own MVC.  The server's output is the View for the server and the Model for the browser.  For a complex set of objects in a given Model, the final output of those objects is their View, and the consumer of that output uses it as a Model.  In theory, any View can be a Model for the thing accepting the View, so in a complex system, you have a chain of MVCs.<p>And one can further imagine that applets written in JavaScript have their own MVC unit.<p>I work on complicated, large-data web apps sometimes daily.

As an example, take a UITableView (iOS) or ListView (Android), backed by a SQLite data store that has returned 2000 rows to display.<p>It's not actually feasible (for performance & memory reasons) to simply render all 2000 rows and allow the user to scroll through them. Instead, both the UITableView & ListView recognize that on a phone, there's only really enough room to display 5-6 rows anyway. So they instantiate those 5-6 rows and populate them with the first few rows from the result set. Then, as the user scrolls down, additional rows can be loaded in, and the previously used rows (that have now been scrolled off-screen) get recycled to represent new rows at the bottom of the table view. Additionally, the data for each row can be loaded on-demand as the user scrolls the row into view, and then be freed once that row has scrolled off screen.<p>It's a nice and tidy optimization that is absolutely necessary on both platforms (failure to implement the recycling mechanism can basically kill your scrolling performance). That is just one example, there are many more optimizations developers make to keep their apps smooth and responsive on iOS/Android, and a lot of those optimizations involve relatively low-level interaction with the underlying GUI toolkit.<p>I don't think these types of optimizations are feasible when writing HTML+JS apps, they're simply abstracted too far away from the underlying GUI toolkit. (Some might even say that layer of abstraction is the entire point of using HTML+JS in the first place.) Regardless, I think it severely limits the scope of the types of apps you can create using HTML+JS.<p><i>And I haven't even mentioned games, or apps that do any sort of audio/image/video processing.

I am currently designing my website to be responsive to varying screen sizes. However, while I started off using a fluid grid, I didn't like it much. For instance, in too many instances, proportions were thrown off when the width would change but not the height.<p>I opted for remaining responsive, but just using a fixed grid/layout within each parameter. i.e. cell phone, tablet, ultrabook, desktop, etc. I can always refining it more and more (although could become a pain managing too many screen sizes). However, since I like white space anyway, I just design at the smaller end of each screen size range and then just let white space / gutters grow until hitting the top of the range. When I hit the new breaking point, I change the grid, I'll adjust again.<p>Is this common practice? Or are just sticking with more fluid grids still recommended?<p>Any advice?",1341253679

4190071,comment,4189811,4189811,1,0,jasim,,,"MVC is not dead. It has its warts, but there still is a strong developer community who build applications using MVC - through MVC based frameworks, and also by handrolling implementations that are an approximation of MVC. As long as there are enough people using it, MVC can't be pronounced 'dead'.<p>As to MOVE, the issue that the author points as the problem with Controllers in MVC is that'controllers are nice self-contained bits of.. what?'. At some point people will start asking these questions about 'Operations' and 'Events'. What would you classify as an 'event' vs an 'operation'. Some mature Rails projects that I've seen already uses this paradigm - there is an internal synchronous pub/sub event listener to which messages can be pushed by both the controller and the model. Even then, there is always a question of where to put what. Some answers are very clear - like an audit log which is only a side effect. But it is not the case always.<p>The author is trying to solve this 'classification' problem by giving us a more granular model. This can help to a certain degree - but there will be some point where even this wont help us. At that point we can choose go to a finer granularity, or ask the question whether all this extra organization is worth the hassle?<p>Abstractions are not without a cost. Some abstractions are too essential for any project. Some abstractions are nice to have. But all of them have a cost. In the case of MVC, the cost of the extra organization is paid many times over by the increased maintainability of the application. But given the number of components the MOVE paradigm advocates, I'm doubtful whether the added organization will be worth the cost.<p>I agree with what DHH said on a recent podcast - it is easy to talk about concepts in abstract and they can look really good. But what changes the game is a real implementation and being able to contrast the code 'before' the change and 'after' the change. This is not feasible all the time - some things have to go through the ideation and a slow testing phase. But at the least, I'm looking forward to see a non-trivial application that uses this paradigm. I'm ready to try imagining how it would have looked in MVC and decide whether the extra organization is worth it.",1341252893

The extra level of indirection is a very handy place to put business logic, then each class in the tier has a dedicated function:<p><pre><code>  Controller -- Parses input, delegates the action and returns the response (rendered by the view).\n  Manager -- Handles sanitized data, encapsulates business logic and makes calls into the Model / Data layer.\n  DAO -- Interfaces with the data store, makes sure only good data goes in, and appropriate responses are returned.\n</code></pre>\nThis approach doesn't seem to offer anything more than that, except for putting a label on the messaging between subsystems, but those operations are not well defined (at least in this piece), and seem like another nebulous way to bury logic.<p>It seems like this problem has arisen from a rather narrow reading of what an MVC system should be, as in, not having utility libraries because they aren't strictly an M a V or a C.<p>*edit: formatting.",1341252442

4190001,comment,4189811,4189811,6,0,alttab,,,"This is certainly interesting. I like the event based model. Here are my thoughts:<p>If your controllers are getting fat and spaghetti like, I wouldn't blame MVC. There are many patterns one can use that are compatible with MVC without going to a completely different architecture. For instance, if you need to encapsulate multi-model interaction you can create a presenter abstraction that the controller simply calls into. Just because there is a bunch of code that ends up in the controller because ""you don't know where to put it"" doesn't mean there isn't a better place to put it without re-designing the entire application.<p>Another thing is while I love the data-binding event deal, this really only works for client-side frameworks like Backbone. Server-side kinda goes at the window, but I suppose you could add a framework that piped event signals in the response from changes that occurred in the ORM layer (although this further couples components).<p>I'm not convinced that separating the data from the methods that operate is a great idea unless you want to go purely functional. Doing this clearly breaks encapsulation, throws any notion of OOP out the window, and still binds the ""operations"" too closely to the data. Generally speaking, the data is useless without the operations and vice versa.<p>So the real difference between MOVE and MVC, at least according to this article, is that models are no longer useful on their own, the controllers aka ""operations"" know everything about how to manipulate models (it shouldn't), and models generate events which are only consumed by views, which makes no sense if you wanted to use the model on its own (but you can't without your operations).<p>Generally speaking, the model should <i>MODEL</i> something. That includes data and behavior. Without both, you have a database, and a set of operations kinda like a C library but only because OOP hadn't been invented yet.<p>In my mind this further couples all of the components because it actually increases the reliance on each other for them to be useful.<p>MVC isn't dead. There is a good chance you are using it wrong. I highly suggest Rails Antipatterns. While it is specific to Rails, it works for MVC in general. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Rails-AntiPatterns-Refactoring-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321604814"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Rails-AntiPatterns-Refactoring-Addison...</a><p>edit: spelling",1341252177

It may be a difficult sell in that there's only limited chance for a user to click through an ad - I notice a lot of the launch advertisers are the kind who do ""branding campaigns"" where they don't worry amount click-through.

If they're viewing 1,000 ads per year, that's only worth a few bucks at typical CPMs, and you have to figure they only expect a device being used that much to last 2-3 years.<p>So a $25 discount seems pretty generous in that light.<p>(Me, I'd happily accept some small ads at the bottom of the reading page if it pushed the price under $100.

It will be at least a few more generations of hardware before OS-level developers will be able to focus specifically on the features of solid state drives when designing the filesystem and main OS APIs.<p>That said, there is room for someone to develop a filesystem API designed with solid state in mind, or even an entire OS, but I don't know if there would be enough of a market to make that development worthwhile.<p>Is there Anything about SSDs that interests you, from the perspective of the future of Redis?",1302564101

SML has slightly nicer records, in that you don't need to declare a record type, and can (and often are) used in a way similar to labeled arguments in OCaml. Unfortunately, structures cannot contain functors, and functors cannot return functors. Since I switched, first class modules have been added to OCaml, but I never used them in OCaml so I don't know how useful they would be.<p>One benefit of SML I have found is that function applications (including operator applications) are clearly separated from other types of expressions in the precedence parsing, so it is easier to remember the precedence rules in SML than it is in OCaml.<p>So, all of that is less than compelling, but I mention it because if you are comfortable with OCaml, you will likely be comfortable with SML. The reason I switched is because of MLton, which is pretty outstanding at optimization. You can write in whichever style works for you, because all the stylistic changes you would use with other compilers or interpreters for performance reasons don't really have any effect. There is basically no runtime barrier for using any kind of abstraction.

You'd think it would be the other way around given that each pound is worth more than a dollar, but I guess you just give greater value to the currency you use everyday.<p>Though I wonder, would you generate more sales selling a product for £6, than you would selling it for $9? And could you switch your pricing from $9 to £9 (~$14.71) and maintain a similar conversion rate?",1302563181

2434861,comment,2434333,2434442,4,0,bfe,,,"There's a reverse problem too with complaining about karma farming eroding the SNR. I care about learning interesting things and couldn't care less about my karma on a website. I've only ever submitted two articles, and those were only after I read something that I found profoundly interesting that had just been posted (I read them right after getting an email alert that they were posted). For both, I also took the time to search HN to make sure they hadn't been submitted yet, before I hit the button. But the second one still drew complaints of being a duplicate based on prior submissions of a related previous Techchrunch post that hadn't shown up in my search and that I'd never noticed despite hitting HN several times a day, because they hadn't been upvoted at all and had quickly plummeted off the first few pages. I hope a solution can be found that cuts down on both redundant submissions and occupying comment space with annoying complaints about redundant submissions (and that obviates the need for annoying complaints about the annoying complaints).<p>I'd suggest trying just eliminating awarding karma to users, at least for submissions - just use the submissions' points for the ordering on the page. It takes way more effort to write a valuable comment than to hit submit for a link, so let comments become the sole determinant of users' karma. I think users would still submit pages they find particularly interesting for HN out of desire to share interesting things.",1302563107

2434849,comment,2433860,2434280,15,0,kwantam,,,"A few years ago, I had some time off from work and decided to spend the week learning *ML. I spent a bunch of time with Standard ML, including the entirety of the older version of the Harper book, and implemented a bunch of nontrivial toys in it.<p>In the end, after having covered the whole book, I became frustrated with the language and jumped ship (to Haskell with a quick stopover at OCaml). My main reason was fragmentation: SML/NJ, MLton, etc. all have somewhat different ""standard"" libraries, which means that in many cases you can't use libraries written for one compiler with another. I ended up having to choose which compiler and set of libraries I wanted per project in order to optimize the availability of libraries for that particular project, which is a frustrating experience. I'd rather learn the idiosyncrasies of one compiler than two.<p>Before jumping to Haskell, I dabbled in OCaml. I did not implement anything serious with it; rather, I went back and reimplemented a couple of the small toys I'd done in SML using OCaml. I decided that if I had to choose between one of these and the other, I'd probably end up going with OCaml: since there's only one major implementation, you won't run into the frustrating experience of trying to merge two disjoint but frustratingly similar ecosystems. To my sensibilities, however, OCaml is a bit uglier syntactically than SML. In the end, I just never clicked with OCaml, and decided that Haskell would scratch my itch better (and it has).<p>Having said all that, I don't mean this to imply that you shouldn't read this book! Reading Harper's book on SML made it much easier to pick up OCaml and Haskell, and I definitely consider it an excellent use of my time. SML is a really nice language and a good introduction to Hindley-Milner, but the SML ecosystem is something of a jungle and you'll probably get frustrated if you stay too long. The biggest thing going for SML vs OCaml, in my opinion, is that the syntax is just plain nicer.",1302562957

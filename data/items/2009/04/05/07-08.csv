547196,comment,546005,546810,0,0,sho,,,"Yes I agree, and sorry for oversimplifying, but the problem is whenever you do try and touch on a detail or two, the complexity multiplies under your fingertips like a frickin' fractal. I mean you name it, it's a problem, and they all feed back into each other in this huge spaghetti mess of unsolvability. To try and talk about it at all in a format such as this is to oversimplify by necessity. I'm try to do so in a reasonably non-misleading way, though.<p>I agree with pretty much everything you say - you had (correct) criticism of my ""deductions"", correct criticism of the libertarian line, correct critcism of the Singer argument. But at least all these arguments are solutions on the table. We can correctly poke holes in all of them, but until we have something to offer ourselves, a ""peer"" argument if you will, it's all just nitpicking. The crisis is current and ongoing and in our faces - well, in their faces, anyway. Some kind of action is necessary, even imperfect action - it's got to be better than nothing.<p>Your argument about cutting off aid killing people is of course understandable and very human, but to me our differences on it sound a lot like a variation on the ""Trolley Problem"" ethical dilemma - where whether killing less people now to save more people later is moral or not seems to simply be a matter of directness. To whit:<p>from <a href=""http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~jgreene/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~jgreene/</a> - I am quite a fan of this guy:<p><i>First, we have the switch dilemma:  A runaway trolley is hurtling down the tracks toward five people who will be killed if it proceeds on its present course. You can save these five people by diverting the trolley onto a different set of tracks, one that has only one person on it, but if you do this that person will be killed. Is it morally permissible to turn the trolley and thus prevent five deaths at the cost of one?   Most people say ""Yes.""<p>Then we have the footbridge dilemma:  Once again, the trolley is headed for five people. You are standing next to a large man on a footbridge spanning the tracks. The only way to save the five people is to push this man off the footbridge and into the path of the trolley.  Is that morally permissible?  Most people say ""No.""</i><p>Is it possible that differing arguments between the ""libertarians"" and the ""Singer-esque"" reduces to this phenomenon? Succinctly, the libertarians are thinking of the switch, and Singer is thinking of the footbridge?<p>As for my own views, well - I think the governance situation is insoluble and propose a UN agency backed by force of arms who will put any country who can't feed, say, more than 0.1% of its population into ""bankruptcy"" adminstration, to be reorganised and released later in a more competent shape. However, I usually can't even say this because of post-colonialist western guilt, which seems to be even more powerful a force than the ""realeconomik"" or ""feed the hungry"" arguments.",1238918196
547195,comment,547049,547131,0,0,triplefox,,,"Within a large city, the difference between one public school and the next can be the difference between a serious study environment, and an environment where the majority are in gangs or come from broken families, and class is disrupted on a daily basis.<p>The explanation is simple: the factors that separate the ghetto from the toniest parts of town will feed into a school system based on geographical location.<p>School busing has been tried as a solution to this, but it causes other problems - expense, high commute times, and a environment where some of the kids are at an obvious - and painful - advantage to others. The parents in a good neighborhood will fight against busing, if it could put their kid in a worse school. The parents in a bad neighborhood may have too many other problems to be concerned with their kid's education.",1238918157
547194,comment,546491,546491,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"From the book<p>""Near the end of the first lecture, I explained what WordPerfect Corporation was not. This set the\nstage for the next two days, when I would explain what WordPerfect Corporation was.<p>WordPerfect Corporation was not a platform for personal achievement, a career ladder to other opportunities, or a challenging opportunity for personal improvement. The company did not put the needs of the individual ahead of its own. The company was not concerned about an employee's\npersonal feelings, except as they related to the company's well-being.<p>WordPerfect Corporation was not intended to be a social club for the unproductive. While other companies might condone many personal or social activities at the office, ours did not. Things like celebrating birthdays, throwing baby showers, collecting for gifts, selling Tupperware or Avon, managing sports tournaments, running betting pools, calling home to keep a romance alive or hand out chores to the children, gossiping or flirting with co-workers, getting a haircut, going to a medical or dental appointment, running to the cafeteria for a snack, coming in a little late or leaving a little early, taking Friday afternoon off, and griping about working conditions were all\ninappropriate when done on company time. Even though these activities were condoned by many businesses across the country, we felt there was no time for them at WordPerfect Corporation.""<p>While all this can be justified, why would anyone want to work at a compnay like this?<p>I found this  interesting since most companies these days at least pretend to do many of these things in order to attract and retain a talented workforce. There is no mention of any ESOP like scheme either. But WP made a lot of money so they must have done something right and hired at least a few good people.<p>Maybe the eighties was just a different time.",1238918136

Develop in Linux--you may find that you never need to go to OS X so you might even opt to get rid of it.  The hardware is really great; the new models are built very well and I hear there is good support for the hardware features like the camera etc. in Linux (double-check that obviously).<p>Especially for Python, which is installed in Leopard but is frozen at 2.5.1, and general web development, you won't struggle at all in Linux.  If you're comfortable in a portable power editor (read: vim/emacs) then you're golden.  Plus, apt-get is _incredible_.  Coupled with multi-booting or VM'ing, you'll happily test across multiple operating systems and browsers.",1238915852

I think it's a little ridiculous (even though I'm sure it happens) to switch to an operating system exclusively for Textmate...<p>I'm not saying you're necessarily wrong, but it's completely unreasonable to say Textmate has ""no match yet"".

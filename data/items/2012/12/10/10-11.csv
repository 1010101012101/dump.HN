4898483,comment,4894812,4895233,1,0,lmm,,,">The phrase ""vanilla Linux"" doesn't even make sense. Linux is a kernel, not an operating system. If you're talking about the entire GNU/Linux operating system, it doesn't make sense to talk about a ""vanilla"" version, because there are thousands of different utilities that can comprise a GNU/Linux-based operating system, and there are combinatorially many ways to create a Linux distribution.<p>The point is, when it breaks and you need someone to help you fix it, it's often not enough to find someone else who ""uses Linux"" - you need to find someone else who runs the same distribution, because they all have their own init scripts, packaging systems, filesystem layouts etc.<p>By contrast, because there is a single FreeBSD, anyone who ""uses FreeBSD"" can probably help you with your FreeBSD problems.<p>(Of course, if you choose a popular linux like Ubuntu, there are probably many more people who ""use Ubuntu"" than use FreeBSD)<p>>This is vastly exaggerated. A properly compiled binary or a compatible source file should run on any distro - not just any modern distro, but any older one as well (assuming that it has the correct dependencies installed, etc.).<p>Seriously? I don't think I've ever seen a cross-platform binary that worked without distro-specific hackery. Source sure.<p>>If I wanted to get really snarky here, I'd say that the same thing could happen to BSD too and point to OS X. This is just ridiculous - Linux is open source and free-as-in-freedom, so just because somebody else packages your favorite distro with some stuff you don't like doesn't mean that anybody else has to as well<p>You're right - but there is some truth to the generalization that linux distributions a) rush in software before it's truly stable (Debian stable being the exception that proves the rule) b) are more politicised than FreeBSD. The recent Gnome 3 / Unity fuss would be unthinkable in FreeBSD-land. In the time it's taken Linux to go OSS -> ALSA -> PulseAudio (and say what you like but I know several people whose sound broke with each of those) FreeBSD has stuck with OSS. Linux introduced devfs, encouraged users to migrate, then deprecated and killed it off in the space of about 18 months (in favour of udev); FreeBSD has only ever had one devfs. FreeBSD ships binary compatibility going back to at least version 5, while very few linux distributions still ship glibc5 libraries. In FreeBSD I've never had a driver that used to work stop working (under linux I used the qc-usb driver, which then stopped building against newer kernels; also the drivers for my PDA (sc-somethingorother)).",1355137073

No.  In a wiki the pages are semi-automatically linked.  Go and look at the very original wiki, the very first one by Ward Cunningham[0].  Pages are linked completely according to the text, and there is absolutely no hierarchical structure.  Even wikipedia has no hierarchical structure because of being a wiki. It has some structure, but that is imposed independently.<p>You then also say:<p><pre><code>  > ... not using a browser ...\n</code></pre>\nSo it would appear that we have established that what you want:<p>* Isn't editable through a web interface - unlike a wiki<p>* Has some sort of hierarchical structure - unlike a wiki<p>* Doesn't use a browser - unlike a wiki<p>So what you want is, in fact, not a wiki.  That leads me to wonder what you do actually want.  You seem to want to have some pages that use markdown (or something), and are somehow arranged in a hierarchical manner, and then somehow presented in that hierarchical manner, but without using a browser.<p>So I don't understand what you want.  Here are some questions:<p>* You say you want the files in some sort of hierarchy - how is that defined?<p>* How do you envisage a user accessing this static ""site"" given that you said you don't use a browser?<p>* After you make a change to a page, do you initiate the re-building of your static site manually, or do you envisage some sort of automated process?<p>* Where is your ""simple static wiki"" stored, in order to be accessible?<p>* Is it just you accessing it?  Or is it open to others?<p>Answers to these (and many other) questions might help us understand what you actually want.<p>Just don't call it a wiki.<p>[0] <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WelcomeVisitors"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WelcomeVisitors</a>",1355135966

In retrospective its funny to look at those times, see how 2D games were much better, but nonetheless pushed away by their 3D equivalents.<p>Today we probably take 3D for granted, but we forget that back then it was jaw-dropping to see Mario in 3D and jump in something that looked like an endless world.<p>These days I just prefer good games over games that use a specific art style or technology. The 2D/3D worlds got also mixed together and I dont think that it has that much meaning compared to the 3D defining times, i.e. there are a lot of 2D side scrollers that use gorgeous 3D backgrounds and the marketing hype is long gone.",1355135530

4898362,comment,4898259,4898259,8,0,mhd,,,"I always considered this to be a false dichotomy, as there's really a continuum between text editors and what we tend to call IDEs. Let's pick Java as an example.<p>At one end of the spectrum you have very simple editors without any extension and/or abuse capabilities, e.g. Windows' Notepad.exe. Not a lot you can do besides adding and removing text, and possibly searching for it. Everything in a per-character level, no introspection in the structure of the current class or the whole project.<p>The next step in the editor/IDE spectrum either pulls in external tools or moves us towards ""programmer's editors"". Probably the best known example of the ""toolshed"" version is Unix. You still use a rather simple editor (plain vi, pico, leafpad), but combine it with a plethora of text-based tools to manipulate the source files. grep, sed, awk etc.<p>As for more advanced editors, probably the first two features that bring us closer to the ""true IDE"" end are syntax highlighting and compiler output parsing, allowing you to jump to lines causing errors. Add some simple way to manage multiple files (i.e. a directory tree) and you're rather close to some earlier IDEs (outside of the Lisp/SmallTalk school).<p>At this stage, some simple parsing of the source files is often added, allowing you to autocomplete and navigate to some extent. Quite often some version of the ctags utility is used for that.<p>I guess that leaves us the biggest step: Going from such regexp-based ad hoc parsing utilities and modules to properly understanding the code, like the compiler or interpreter itself uses. This allows better completion and enables complicated structure-based actions like refactoring or context-sensitive search and replace.<p>The ""power"" of the editing component is pretty orthogonal to all that and I'd argue that this is the main dividing line. People wouldn't mind having better ""integration"", but are wary to miss all the editing and/or extension capabilities. Forced asceticism is relatively rare (outside of 9fans), it's just that quite often it comes down to a choice you have to make between high level and low level abilities. With the IDE you might be able to navigate and change a lot on a class point of view, but once you leave the syntax tree and there's little support for ""common"" editing tasks where you'd just fly through with e.g. emacs/vim macros. It would look like the ""IDE"" part is the more complicated one and so it's easy enough to add those missing text editing features.<p>If only. For some kind of reason, most IDEs (esp. the Java ones) aren't that good at extending their capabilities. If you're ever cornered by a horde of former Java developers turned zombies, shouting ""Eclipse plugin"" is pretty sure to reach even their rotting cerebral cortex and send them shambling away (if that alone doesn't work, add some ""maven! pom!"" into your mix). Meanwhile, there are working vim plugins and emacs lisp modules for any non-physical task (and probably quite a few physical ones).<p>From the other side of things, the success of making those editors into IDEs is mixed. For Lisp and some other languages, Emacs <i>is</i> one, but the Java module isn't quite up to par. Vim has its ""eclim"" plugin, which in conjunction with Eclipse might actaully get somewhere. But for most languages and development environments, it probably still comes down to making a choice.<p>One thing that I've found (although, again, there's nothing inherent in the distinction enforcing that) is that ""IDEs"" are better integrated with the <i>language</i> (singular, sadly), whereas the extensible editors are more integrated/adapted to the <i>user</i>.<p>As a final personal note: I generally don't like it when I have to be ""helped"" by my environment too little or too much. Some support is good, but if I have to consult the program all the time, it probably means that I'm wasting time and might not understand the solution domain enough. Waiting for autocompletion is a good example, for common tasks, I'd like to <i>know</i> things, not look them up all the time. And if it's rare enough, I'll probably be better served by reading the documentation that just hoping that this method with those parameters is sufficient.\nAnd as languages come and go, I prefer to invest a bit more time in editors that will stand the test of time (which means a lot of hopping back and forth between emacs and vim).<p>For some languages, it's IDEs, though. That includes SmallTalk (because the IDE is that good) and Java (because the language is that bad).",1355134385

Is a test really a unit test if it uses another production class? I go back to the two qualities: Does the test run fast? Can it help us localize errors quickly? Naturally, there is a continuum. Some tests are larger, and they use several classes together. In fact, they may seem to be little integration tests. By themselves, they might seem to run fast, but what happens when you run them all together? When you have a test that exercises a class along with several of its collaborators, it tends to grow. If you haven't taken the time to make a class separately instantiable in a test harness, how easy will it be when you add more code? It never gets easier.<p>- From ""Working Effectively With Legacy Code"" by Michael Feathers.

The level of granularity, like the OP said, changes depending on the complexity and the critical nature of each part of the code.<p>Some people argue that if I make an error in function A and that causes a unit test fail for function B - that can mislead a developer into thinking function B has an error.  I argue that a) it rarely misleads anybody for very long and b) if I had function B tested in total isolation with mocks then that error in function A might have slipped through unnoticed.  It's tricky to mock up some combination that you weren't expecting to happen.<p>Obviously in ideal circumstances you would be doing both unit and integration testing.

3741348,comment,3740173,3740967,3,0,Dn_Ab,,,"I do not think Scala is an ML. The use of the word acceptable and indeed restricting it to an ML derivative loses the point of what Scala is supposed to be. Scala is supposed to be something different: a successful melding of OOP and functional. And it is the best at that I have seen. It succeeds on this better than the next biggest contender: F#, which is the most acceptable ML, IMO. F# is more typically functional,  using the usual Hindley Milner Inference and sharing a core with OCaml but with significant whitespace. So it can be very succinct. Typically functional idioms like algebraic data types, Piping, point free, currying and combinators is more natural to F# than Scala's more OOP way. I prefer F# to Scala but that is merely a subjective preference.<p>There are a number of things that Scala does naturally that are cumbersome in other languages because of how it manages to meld a powerful combination of orthogonal features. To use Scala as just another functional language is to miss its power. Those who criticize OOP have not used a language that does it right.  Abstractly, in a simplified categoric setting, we can consider OOP (objects as coalgebras) and FP (algebraic data types) as duals of each other. A proper unification of the concepts gives something more powerful than either. I think Scala comes the closest. Sure you can be 100% functional in it, or replicate Java but to call it one or the other is to make the same mistake as to say that light is both a wave and a particle and think you understand what that means.",1332442556

I'll try to respond here, but I have a feeling we're already off-the-rails so I'm not going to do one of those 47-level nested things.<p><i>to what extent are you involved in local/regional/national politics</i><p>I am and have been student of complex systems of both people and technology. As such, I'm aware of all these things. But this is not about me, my experiences or qualifications. Let's not go there. Also you are talking applied politics -- the getting of results. My essay is on design themes. The two are not related at all.<p><i>None of his claims are backed by any kind of supporting evidence or analysis, or even clarification of exactly what he means.</i><p>Dude. It's a blog. Blogs are written quickly and in an off-hand, informal manner. This is just a list of thoughts. It's not even an argument. You want the Federalist Papers, go see Madison.<p>You go into a lot of other details here -- arguments against  term limits and in support of possible presidents for life -- Including a nice little ad-hominem about the people who took action against FDR when he tried to pack the court. Memories DO last a long time, eh? :) I'm going to pick the one that is easiest to reply to.<p><i>All decisions have consequences, and all big decisions today will still effect people 30 years from now</i><p>Yes, but I was specifically referring to taxation and debt. The funny thing here is that it doesn't even matter if I provide an argument or not. At some level of pain, future generations will just invalidate earlier debt anyway. All I was suggesting is that we be honest about the situation while we were making the debt, instead of sticking our heads in the sand.<p><i>Words are cheap. Making real political change is damn hard</i><p>Yes, and design principles are a dime-a-dozen. The intent wasn't to change, or even suggest a method of change. We're talking principles of construction, not applied politics or how to make the world a happier place. An ideal system would function for many parties with many various dreams of how they would want their government to work.<p>If you'd like to dive down on some of these, sounds like fun! Send me an email. Happy to take some kind of public space like my blog or something and explore the foundations of what I'm talking about. But one blog entry or a comment thread on HN isn't going to do it.<p>Thanks again for the feedback. You sound very passionate. I hope that passion stays with you.",1332442256

3741331,comment,3728885,3735215,1,0,zby,,,"My point is that the definition of functional programming is this purity you mention not using first-class functions. Pure means that something has more of that thing you want and impure means it has less - so pure functional programming has more 'functional programming' then 'standard functional programming'.  Sure completely pure functional programming is impractical - there are degrees to how purely functional are the languages we use in practice - but this is the point practical languages are more or less functional and how much are they functional depends on how much they depend on state manipulation not on using higher order functions or having first class functions.<p>Defining functional programming as programming with first-class functions is a consistent definition and could be used  if not the fact that more people use the other definition (at least that is what the wikipedia definition and other online material makes me believe).",1332442212

I'm a fan of it. It was looking just like this current version 6 years ago and was pretty fast at even IE6. And its 6 years old JavaScript code follows the rules of coding good JavaScript code way more than Ember itself.<p>Here is another story: I was working for a competitor of EditGrid and built a Microsoft Excel clone with dozens of features in 6 months, using no framework, no library, 5 years ago. We were two guys at frontend and two other guys in at backend. And our source code was almost pure object orient, mixable, reusable and relying on MVC, event-driven programming.<p>I've been shipping rich web apps for more than 6 years and recently had the chance of working with both Backbone and Ember. Here is my feedback:<p>The size of Ember library is bigger than total source code (including an AI library) of the last multiplayer game I built.<p>And both of them solve no problem, simplify nothing. They just force beginners to not code crappy code and that's all. Good JavaScript code should benefit of functional programming very well, like some NodeJS apps and libraries. They got no understanding of FP. Especially Ember relies on a horrible idea that increases the cost of development very huge. Very ironically, ember code is not reusable, not mixable with other web apps. It's not even unobtrusive, pollutes Object prototypes. When you finish your app, you got a huge garbage that has not even one piece of reusable code.<p>To summarize, there is nothing Ember does right. It tries to solve already solved problems in a very absurd way and is very irrelevant with the new problems JavaScript community tries to solve (such as code-reuse with NodeJS apps, it's partly solved)<p>It's the new, communist North Korea of JavaScript world.",1332440584

I find it gratifying and inspiring.<p><i>Everyone was quick to assume that if other people thought their code was confusing, then it probably was...There's unspoken machismo, which put into words would sound like this: ""Nasty opaque codebase? What's wrong, can't take the complexity, little man?""</i><p>Also, I find this to be key. There is room for raw talent and huge, inspiring amounts of clever -- but it needs to be focused exactly where it does the most good. Let's just assume that one's competitors are in the same league when it comes to intellectual horsepower. Then it behooves one to make sure one's resources are focused where they do the most good. Let the competition dissipate their intellectual powers in developer pissing matches while you quietly outperform them.<p>Of late, I've come around to a radical stance on this. Modulo DRY, one should almost always target one's code to the lowest common denominator programmer on the team -- the newbie. This should probably follow an 80/20 or 90/10 rule. If a bog-standard well informed and competent programmer can't come in and start fixing 80% of your code within an hour, and it's not due to lack of non-programming specialized domain knowledge, then you're doing it wrong. There's room for elegant abstractions and the odd clever hack -- but you only get to have at most 7 of these in any given subsystem, and the code involved should be the minority of your codebase.<p>Clever is a valuable resource.

(It's fine if they're tuning the apology up, a good thing even, so I'm not interested in tracking down the earlier one).<p>That said: ""We never meant to... and we are sorry"" is an apology antipattern.<p>Your instinct is that there's social value in signaling that you aren't (sexist/a plagiarizer/a serial laundry-on-floor dumper††/what-have-you). Your instinct is often right. <i>However</i>: apologize first. Your #1 priority in an apology is not to explain yourself and it's not (as many people on HN seem to think) to wear a hair shirt. Your priority is to <i>communicate that you understand the concern and that you believe it's valid</i>.<p>A quick list of issues I have with this apology (as an example of the form, not as a moral issue):<p>* It doesn't know what it's trying to do, and so comes across as evasive.<p>* It fails to establish that the author understands the validity of the concern.<p>* It spends its crucial first several sentences talking about the concerns of the apologizer (WE never meant to, WE are about the inclusion of every geek)<p>* It introduces the totally irrelevant point of the gender of the producer of the video (repeatedly) in a manner that makes it easy to read an <i>objection</i> out of the apology (""a woman made this, so why are you complaining?"")†<p>* In startlingly bad form, it introduces the totally irrelevant point that the complainer applied for a job but did not end up working (subtextually, for at least a large number of readers: the complainer was turned down for a job)<p>* It tries to mitigate the concern by saying other women will speak on their behalf, which is also simply not relevant.<p>* It at one point blames the complainer (""we were taken off guard by her continued comments after we..."")<p>* It actually brags about the apologizer (""I’ve built my career over 15 years working to make this world a better place for women, mothers, and children"") --- in other words, this is an apology that both wants to serve as a +10 amulet of apologies against Twitter concerns <i>and</i> a marketing document.<p>These aren't moral issues. They're strategic and tactical failures.<p>The <i>marketing goal</i> of an apology is #1 to communicate your understanding of the validity of the concern and (very optionally) #2 to communicate as a feature/benefit message the steps you're taking to make it never happen again.<p>The <i>business goals</i> of an apology are #1 to put the issue to rest, #2 to put the issue to rest, #3 to put the issue to rest... #1984983 to put the issue to rest, and #1984984 (very optionally) to learn and grow from the experience.<p>It is, for whatever it's worth, a little annoying to feel obligated to write this much about this issue on an HN thread nobody is really reading (this is I think buried on the second page already). I'd appreciate it if you didn't assume I was required to respond at essay-length to every concern you might have with a comment. These are message board comments; unless you think I was directly wrong, maybe let some lack of depth go, every once in awhile?<p>† <i>Way to handle this issue, if it's really important that the issue</i> be <i>handled in your apology: apologize to the video designer and say you hope no part of this reflects badly on her, &c</i>.<p>†† <i>Wanna get good at apologizing?

They'll pretty much disregard your email altogether (You probably WOULDNT be surprised by how many emails we get in a day begging for coverage for this or that. But it is a lot.

Personally, I like to HEAR the enthusiasm for your product come through in your email. People who are extremely passionate about their product usually make for good stories regardless of the product. The folks at mashable write on tech for a living. So if you have a novel idea there, they're probably going to write about it.

That's lead to now, where some laws are wholly inadequate to deal with real issues that we face.<p>In hiring laws, it's the applicants that are getting screwed by the lack of these laws, because their choices are to either acquiesce to the hiring manager's demands or lose the job. While it's easy for some people to say ""I'd just walk out,"" a single mother who needs to feed her kids probably wouldn't be so quick to do so.<p>In the end, it's a matter of the job market. If the market were flush with openings, hiring managers would have to be on their best behavior for fear of losing a promising candidate. Right now though, that's unfortunately not the case, so it's up to regulation to give people some basic rights. In my opinion.",1332439827

Basically, if I am average Joe redditor, there are two potential reasons for a downvote:<p>1) The post is something I personally disagree with.<p>2) The post was written by a moron (for various definitions of the word moron).<p>What I wish is that someone (smarter than myself) could come up with a way to reliably determine the motive behind a downvote. I know that's no simple task. But I actually want posts that are slightly more controversial to rank higher than posts which don't generate a lot of downvotes, simply because I'm more interested in reading something thought-provoking than checking out the latest batch of meme-gen.<p>Basically I want comment rankings to look like this:<p>a) Lots of downvotes, few upvotes == total asshole. Maybe racist, maybe a general troll, but I want this ranked at the rock bottom.<p>b) An equal number of upvotes vs. downvotes == flamebait. I'm not interested in the latest holy wars, so we call this the next lowest in rankings.<p>c) Lots of upvotes, few downvotes == uninteresting. Rank it lower.<p>d) The ratio upvotes/downvotes is greater than 1, but less than some finite number N. These are the stories I want to read.<p>I want a ranking system that works something like the above, albeit with more finesse (e.g. perhaps we swap the ranking position of b and c). I'm just not interested in the latest round of adorable kitten pictures, and on HN, too much emphasis on the sheer number of upvotes manifests as groupthink.

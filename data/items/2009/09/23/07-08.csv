838851,comment,838558,838558,0,0,halo,,,"I'm not really sure why Techcrunch dislike Bartz.<p>Yahoo have been struggling with their position in search for years, and they have been losing marketshare. They have an inferior product, and they haven't been able to compete technologically with their main competitor. Their advertising platform isn't big enough to maximise their returns, since Google has most of the mindshare.<p>A partnership with Microsoft for search engine technology seems like a decent approach, since Microsoft are willing to put the investment in to ensure Bing's search technology is as good as Google's, and their combined single ad platform is going to advantageous to both companies.<p>Yahoo aren't giving up on search. They're still going to have a search engine, afterall, and Yahoo is still going to have their own custom interface with Bing's results being the backend. Ultimately, they're just giving up trying to compete technologically with Google. They've long been unable to do that anyway - no-one uses Yahoo for their superior results.<p>So what's next for Yahoo? Slimlining. Strengthening their core businesses - refreshing their main services (portal, e-mail, messenger) combined with an advertising push is good, as is their plans to expand into the Arabic markets. Closing dated, unpopular, or unprofitable services (are people seriously mourning the loss of Geocities, Yahoo Brief Case and Yahoo 360?). Getting rid of properties or partnerships that differ from their core business as a content provider. I honestly don't see what's so bad about that.<p>Were people expecting miracles in 8 months?",1253692594

It also has includes ""Transaction costs"" for buying a new(er) car.  It's been 5 years since I bought my first, and so far only car (a '96 Camry, still going strong), but I'd disagree that the cost of time looking for a new car is <i>much</i> less, if at all.<p>I would also be inclined to disagree with their assertion that ""your car is in no way a positive-dollar-value asset"". While I'm sure there are usage patterns where this statement is true, in cities with poor public transit, employment may be effectively directly conditioned on owning a car, thus very quickly making it a positive-dollar-value.

Imagine buying a 1080p HDTV and then showing solid colors on it only - not only a waste of engineering effort</i><p>The difference is that the HDTV costs extra, while the rating resolution does not.<p><i>but also building subsequent systems around the validity of your 5-star ratings will also be fundamentally broken.</i><p>It depends on how you interpret and use the data.<p><i>Also, based on their data there's a very concrete reason why the 1-5 star rating is worse than the thumbs up/thumbs down. With the thumbs up/down system you have a single dimension of data (""likedness""), whereas with the 1-5 star rating system they're only getting data from people who like the video (and almost none from people who disliked it, look at the distribution). This makes the data practically useless for determining the quality and user preference for a video. </i><p>Again: With only people who like voting 5 stars and a few people who dislike voting 1 star you have the <i>exact same</i> information as with a ""favoriting only"" voting system, or as a thumbs up/down one with few people voting down (which is very likely). So how is it any more useless? The only real problem I see is that people probably interpret the ratings differently - to some, 1 star is ""the worst possible vote"", to others it is ""one notch better than no vote"".<p><i>Consequently ranking algorithms just won't work on the star system - the difference between video #1 and #100,000 can be an average rating of 4.8 and 4.92.</i><p>Which is not necessarily a problem, if you weigh the average by the number of votes. Sure, you don't want to rate a video with one 5-star rating higher than one with 5000 5-star ratings and one 1-star rating. But you don't have to.<p><i>So are movie ratings - but it's still a very useful metric to a lot of people. With a large enough sample size you get the lowest common denominator preference measure - which may be what YouTube wants.</i><p>Um, yeah. That's exactly what I said.<p><i>I object to the labeling of basic user behaviour as laziness or some type of stupidity. </i><p>You're reading something into my comment that I did not say. Actually yeah, it's lazy... and people have every right to be - they go to YouTube to be entertained, not because they're being paid for it.<p>People do something because there are rewards. With user-generated content, the rewards are generally immaterial: attention, status, self-expression. The only reward for thoughtful ratings is self-expression, but very limited because nobody can see your vote. Even a single-word comment is more rewarding than that. So if you want people to spend the time and effort that thoughtful fine-grained ratings require, you'd have to add artificial rewards - which is almost impossible because you can't measure how thoughtful a rating is.<p>The alternative it to make rating easier, so that more people will do it at the current reward level. And ""easier"" here means ""requiring less thought"".",1253691062

It's always better to describe things precisely. </i><p>The interviewer asked Linus about benchmarks that show the kernel getting slower and slower each year.  Linus acknowledged that the kernel is in fact slowing down.  I don't think they would be worrying about badly configured kernels, or kernels with unnecessary modules loaded.  I don't know what features Linus is talking about that make a properly configured Linux kernel bigger and slower than it was ten years ago.

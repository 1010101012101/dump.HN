Certainly the cooling was significant enough that warming doomsayers weren't too noisy during that period, anyways.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_global_warming#Surveys_of_scientists_and_scientific_literature"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_global_wa...</a><p>Is a good read...  Opinions seem more varied than a lot of people think.  I don't really have an opinion.  I don't have enough facts, but I have to say that the ""torch and pitchforks"" feeling I get from the scientific mob rub me the wrong way.",1227992096

I'm not trying to say that the current system of <i>ad hoc</i> ""version control"" is very good, let alone good enough.<p>I'm just pushing back against this the argument that using a <i>real</i> version control system will create a P.R. problem. If the P.R. problem is going to happen, it's going to happen. The changes are public. People like you are reading them, copying and pasting them, emailing them to each other. I wouldn't be at all surprised if various political professionals are taking snapshots of the site on a weekly basis. There isn't even a security-through-obscurity argument to be made here, because the edits aren't all that obscure!",1227991861
380347,comment,380236,380236,0,0,randomwalker,,,"I wonder if you could generate this automatically. Let me explain where I'm coming from. I made the Theory of Computing Blog Aggregator (<a href=""http://feedworld.net/toc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://feedworld.net/toc</a>), and part of the reason I didn't set up more aggregators with the software was that you need domain-knowledge to create the blogrolls.<p>My idea was that you could start from 2 or 3 ""seeds"" on a given topic, find which blogs they are linking to, filter them by pagerank or technorati rank or whatever, and use an off-the-shelf machine learning tool to determine if they are on the same topic. I never got around to it; other projects I'm working on took up all of my time.<p>But if you can build this intelligence, you can create aggregators/memetrackers/whatever for an unlimited number of topics. And further create communities around each one and so on.<p>If someone wants to collaborate on this idea, let me know.<p>P.S. To build my aggregator, I started off with planet planet (<a href=""http://www.planetplanet.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.planetplanet.org/</a>), but made a bunch of improvements like automatic comment import. There is an unreleased version with a lot more features (including a google reader-like UI) that I will be happy to show anyone who's interested.",1227991798

380344,comment,379296,380073,0,0,GHFigs,,,"That supposed ""design flaw"" did not render your computer inoperable.  You did.  By your own admission it was operating normally until you ""upgraded"" it, breaking it in the process.  Don't complain about anybody else until you can take responsibility for your own mistakes.<p>I don't see how the store was unhelpful, given what you've already described.  What nerve they have--when you walk in with a broken out-of-warranty laptop--to suggest replacing it with a new, functioning, under-warranty one.  How rude and unhelpful it is to suggest a solution with a 100% chance of enabling you to have a functioning machine again!  Instead, you wanted free out-of-warranty repair, which is not a service they offer. Their ""attitude"" has nothing to do with it: they can't give you what you want, and you didn't want what they offered.<p>And again with the non-Apple shops, you're being completely obtuse.  \nApple does not own those shops or set their rates.  Being ""authorized"" only means that they can do repairs under warranty and receive service manuals and parts directly from Apple.  Every other laptop vendor has a similar program.  If a shop ripped you off, you can take it up with them. The OEM has nothing to do with it.<p>Finally, as I said before, you're not speaking at all to the original subject. Instead, you're bitching about how much money you spent fixing your mistake.",1227991550

380342,comment,379948,380313,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"The latter version only tells you the goal. The former version told you the mechanism by which Obama will achieve this goal, namely force. That's information which has been removed. The new information in the latter version is that college students will be paid for their work.<p>We will find out soon enough whether Obama really does support forced labor. I don't think it's an outlandish idea, however. Forced labor has quite a few supporters on the left (Rangel, Clark and McDermott, for instance <a href=""http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:H.R.393"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:H.R.393</a>:).<p>Anyway, this isn't really the place to discuss the merits of Obama's possible policy proposals. My point is this: at one time, change.gov advocated forced labor. The American people deserve to be able to easily look this up for themselves, and see what other changes were made.",1227991296

380340,comment,379955,380030,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"It's a somewhat hard life being a financier because your pay is so variable. You might mock the I-banker who got ""only"" a 5-figure bonus, but what if he took out a mortgage in 2004 with his new wife on the premise that he would be making six figures? Variation is a cost of the lifestyle, and a stressful one at that. It is hard to make any long-term plans. On that note, it's rare to find bankers without family trouble, due to both the work hours and the financial issues.",1227991180

380333,story,,,1,10,yters,"Ask HN: rules of thumb for titling more difficult HN submissions?",,"I know many have been complaining about the lack of depth in our current HN articles.  While this is partially a problem of what people post, it is also a problem of how links are titled.  Many quite good articles do get submitted, but they just don't catch the eye of your average HN reader.<p>If you look at my submission history, you'll see that the better, and more technical articles barely get a vote, whereas a couple more mainstream articles easily hit the front page.  While the mainstream articles are good, I would rather generate interest in the more technical articles and help build up the HN community.<p>Has anyone been successful in promoting these more beneficial links on HN?  If so, what methods do you think work best?  What kills an article off the bat?",1227990556

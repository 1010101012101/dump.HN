1423197,comment,1423092,1423092,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"That cheating occurs is no surprise and is closely related to the question of assessing a programmer's output.  Every time you instigate a method of measurement, the programmer (or teacher) finds some way to increase the result without achieving the actual aim.<p>In the case of a programmer, the number of lines of code output, or the number of functions written, or the number of bugs detected and fixed, can all be achieved with less ""true value output"" (whatever <i>that</i> means).  The measurement can be gamed.<p>Teachers in the UK have been accused of ""teaching to the test"" rather than ""teaching for understanding"" - but what more can be expected?  When exams test for understanding rather than rote skills, only then will understanding be the aim of the teachers looking for the easy way out.<p>Let me add that I know many dedicated teachers who do the right thing regardless of the threats posed.  They encourage and enthuse their students, ranging widely over their subject to get the students engaged and interested.  They know that this serves them better, and will, mostly, improve the test scores, even if not as much as ""teaching to the test"" would.  They know they're doing the right thing, but come under enormous pressure to work more obviously towards improving test scores.<p>I'm not surprised that many of them buckle under the strain and take less honorable courses.<p>That's part of the tragedy - the destruction of otherwise excellent teachers.",1276242938

Keep the number of fonts very low.  Above all, <i>do not use Comic Sans, ever</i>.<p>The animations are distracting because they last too long; make them snappier.  This is a common mistake when designing UI animations; people are afraid that their great animations will go unnoticed if they are too short and make them too long instead.  Trust me, we will notice your short animations.  Also there is a bug: your animations can't be interrupted, so if you mouse in and out 10 times they will continue flashing long after the mouse has stopped moving.  Have you considered using CSS transitions instead of Javascript?<p>Empty space is just as important as text.  You have left plenty of horizontal space, but your vertical spacing is inconsistent.  The menu at the top needs more vertical space around the links (or perhaps the same space needs a smaller font with increased tracking AKA letter-spacing).  The vertical space between items in the right column seems random, with very little space above the RSS link, extra space in the top of the green box and no space at the bottom.  The left column has more space under the byline than above the headline which is weird, and there is zero space below the footer.",1276240524

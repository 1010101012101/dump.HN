97442,comment,97362,97404,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Karma is designed to motivate submissions deemed valuable to the community. ""Exceptional"" is relative to the community and reflects its collective taste.<p>With this many headline spots, this many eyes, and this many submissions, it is unreasonable to expect a filtering mechanism that worked for population size x would work similarly for 10x. Your voice is diluted; what you used to consider {attribute} is now something completely orthogonal.",1200113201

Now they're more of a (all-encompassing) media company, which isn't so far off from the digital hub. I'm not sure how Adobe fits in.<p>If you really see a sale viable, even partially by auction, who would participate? Google (for Flash?)? Microsoft?",1200112252

There is also nontrivial effort going into the numerous little steps, crammed into the methods section, that brought about this experiment.<p>palish's comment is informative but not absolute: depending on your interpretation, the headline may not be sensationalist at all. The software was, as described, an ""F-22 flight simulator."" Confusing to the general public? Yes. Shameful? Not really.<p>I also disagree that it's a high-tech Rube Goldberg machine. The analogous term for EECS folks would be ""hack."" It's like saying a wiimote mod for an FPS is a Rube Goldberg machine... which isn't <i>false</i>, but misses the point, don't you think? As a hack, I think it's very interesting. Not surprising, not epochal, but cool nonetheless. A plane can be flown by software, or by bioware, neither approach is perfect at the moment, so ""hacks"" like these serve their purpose.",1200111424

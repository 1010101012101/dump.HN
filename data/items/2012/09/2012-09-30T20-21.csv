Tap your phone to theirs and they get a business card. When they get home they tap it to a computer and they get a big resume with links to your github or art repos or online examples of your work. It'd be really cool for networking events or job fairs and the like.",1349038786

4594131,comment,4593900,4593900,3,0,orangethirty,,,"Here is an idea.<p>- Create a blogging API.
- The API should give people al of the basic functionality a blog has (post, comments, social, users, etc.).
- CReate a front end that will allow developers and designers to use the API in the blog template to fill it in with content. Example:<p><pre><code>    <title>{% site.com/api/get/blog.title %}</title> 

    <div id=""blog-post"">
     {% site.com/api/get/blog.post/uniqueId %}
    </div>
</code></pre>
And so on.<p>What is hard to deal with blogging is not the platforms there are, but a lack of standarization. Providing a simple API that people can use to create blog around it could prove to be beneficial and profitable.",1349038684

You're out playing games for money, sometimes you're grinding, sometimes going on a raid...<p>To me the best side of finance is when you can go out and see something real and know you made it happen.  When I worked for a major energy company as a side of the desk project I designed a very long term refinery margin lockin trade to enable a 100,000 barrel plus expansion of a refinery.  It wasn't just going to the markets and doing some buy sell orders, but rather we went to a major Opec member and got them to sell us crude oil via a formula and then went to multiple fuel end users and got the to agree to buy fuel on a formula of crude oil + X.  The difference between what we'd buy and sell less operating expenses was far greater than the cost to expand the refinery and we only had to lock up 10 years of the expected min 30 year lifespan of the equipment to do it.<p>All that being said, WAY too many people are going into whiteshirt wall street finance that should be out in the world making stuff happen.

4594079,comment,4593795,4593795,18,0,ilamont,,,"U.S. bloggers: Note that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act gives protection from defamation claims associated with anonymous comments. Quoting from the Electronic Frontier Foundation website (1):<p><i>...Your readers' comments, entries written by guest bloggers, tips sent by email, and information provided to you through an RSS feed would all likely be considered information provided by another content provider. This would mean that you would not be held liable for defamatory statements contained in it...</i><p>The EFF page adds, ""[Section 230] does not apply to federal criminal law, intellectual property law, and electronic communications privacy law.""<p>The Citizen's Media Law project contains additional information about Section 230 and blogging (2):<p><i>Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act grants interactive online services of all types, including blogs, forums, and listservs, broad immunity from tort liability so long as the information at issue is provided by a third party. Relatively few court decisions, however, have analyzed the scope of this immunity in the context of ""mixed content"" that is created jointly by the operator of the interactive service and a third party through significant editing of content or the shaping of content by submission forms and drop-downs.<p>So what are the practical things you can take away from this guide?

A debugger is part of the solution. Easy profiling and object diffing are another. Detecting how vulnerable you are to XSS attacks is yet another. When you have the power to do this inline without breaking your code apart, I think you gain productivity.<p>In other words, these patterns are not something we should have to spend brainpower on.<p>I probably should not have put the screencast on the front page -- it's actually about rationale and not about code examples.

Some people may think that some of the backlash against Apple is ""over-reaction"", but it's exactly the response they'll get when they promise the moon for everything and then they don't deliver.<p>If they would've said ""Our maps are pretty good"", and not something like ""Our maps are the best out there"", maybe the backlash wouldn't have been so bad, although people still have the right to get mad at Apple for replacing a ""better maps app"" with a ""worse maps app"", without giving them any choice in the matter - other than not updating the old devices, I guess.<p>But yeah, my point is Apple generally overhypes anything they build - so they go on the ""positive extreme"". So they shouldn't be surprised that when people find out their features are not as good as they say, they go on the ""negative extreme"" with the backlash. Cause and effect. Maybe Apple should be more moderate and more honest with their marketing in the future. To be honest, I'm surprised there hasn't been this kind of backlash over the Siri ads, too.",1349037657

JustFab is not a scam, and I would not be involved with it if it was -- indeed it's a spectacular and very consumer friendly company that I'm proud to be a part of and I think will be a great success.<p>This comment thread has been quick to conclude that it is a scam, on some fairly sketchy evidence.  While I don't dispute that the author's friends experience might be true, the fact that someone didn't notice that they were signing up for a subscription product is somewhat undermined by the fact it took them 8 months to realize the charge was appearing on their credit card.  It's possibly not a person who pays attention to details.<p>If you want to understand the degree to which the company's customer base understands and is in love with the company, check out their facebook page and the consumer engagement.  Here's a pair of shoes they posted for a sneak peak this week:
<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152125991230508&set=a.10150096250320508.399057.493343965507&type=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152125991230508&#3...</a><p>90 Comments, 4,800 likes in a few days -- for a commercial promotion.  Read the comments on this or any of their threads -- no one is bitching about being scammed or not understanding they are members of a suscription site -- they LOVE it.<p>Justfab has hundreds of thousands of subscribers.  A new subscriber who joined last month will, given churn rates, be likely to be a paying subscriber for more than two years.  They will make purchases in more than four months in their first year.  They understand the premise:  a personal shopper has selected a boutique for them at the beginning of the month, all the products are great value, and their obligation is to come and check the boutique that has been prepared.  If they don't want anything that month, they just click skip and they're done.<p>Now, many of you would clearly prefer a world where you would not have to log in to say ""no thanks"" -- and that world is available to you at the mall.  Justfab shoes are quality identical to shoes twice their price at the mall, because they have crushed the traditional retailer and supply value chain.  But to deliver the value that the customers want, they need to be very thoughtful about costs.<p>The #1 challenge in ecommerce is customer acquisition.  Pretty much every company has to spend more to acquire a customer than they will make in margin on the first transaction, so you're dependent on a lifetime value of purchases to make money.  The reason few outside of Amazon have been able to make this work, and even Amazon (and it's bought businesses like Zappos and Diapers) make very little money is because you keep having to reacquire the customers to get their business... think of people just clicking through those google ads at the top, whether they've been there before or not.<p>The idea of the subscription model is to get customers in a regular habit of checking in.  When they commit to that, Justfab can in turn commit to pricing for the quality they provide that would be unheard of anywhere else.  Justfab's typical customer isn't wealthy but likes to look good, and can't afford to just disregard price, and JF is the place they find a style/quality/affordability combination that works for them.<p>To be clear: as stated, JustFab is on track to do $100M+ in sales this year, from hundreds of thousands of subscribers who check in every month and understand exactly what they're getting into.  The site has a very high net promoter score, a return rate that is less than half of Zappos.<p>As a general rule, if a customer signs up for a subscription product, doesn't check in and calls in because they got charged, we explain the system and try to keep them as a customer, but if they want a refund they will generally get it.  People who don't call for 8 months I'm less sure about what the standard policy is.<p>If I go to the homepage, the biggest call to action for me (it's customized so not everyone will get the same) is ""Buy one get one free sale happening now.  JOIN TODAY.""  If they were trying to trick you, would the call to action say Join?<p>As has been pointed out, when you join by making your first purchase, the purchase page which others have linked has two key things:<p>*  A very clear description that you are signing up for a subscription program.  This says plainly and in bold type, in the same font size as everything else on the page: 
""If You Do Not Make A Purchase Or Skip The Month By The 5th, You'll Be Charged $39.95 For A Member Credit On The 6th.
Each credit can be redeemed for any JustFab style on the site.""<p>* A check box that says you accept the terms of VIP membership.  This box is in a clear and large font, uses the word membership, and is not opt-out -- you have to proactively opt-in.<p>I don't see how a reasonable person could argue that this is a scam or a trick.  Not only are the terms presented in plain english and large fonts, the site has a huge number of passionate and loyal customers.",1349037571

As far as settled SCOTUS cases go, the <i>only</i> reason why police need a warrant to attach a GPS to your car is because they must ""sieze"" the car (for however brief a time) in order to attach the device. As you alude to, it has nothing to do with the surveillance itself. However this is far from a settled issue. At least 4 out of the 9 SCOTUS justices support a new Fourth Amendment theory called the ""mosaic theory"", introduced by Alito in US v. Jones (2012). Under this theory, courts would evaluate the actions by government in aggregate to determine if the actions constituted a search. Under such a doctrine, 24 hour GPS surveillance on public roadways may well be illegal without a warrant. This theory has been criticized by some academics as too difficult of an analysis for the courts to handle. Yet it does show that the justices are indeed considering the scope of surveillance and some of them are trying to figure out a way to limit the scope using Fourth Amendment analysis. Alito in particular seems worried about it and he has found support for at least some of his ideas from Ginsburg, Breyer, Kagan, and Sotomayor",1349036938

4594018,comment,4593296,4593923,18,0,BklynJay,,,"Bottom line: everything about financial software is what Joel Spolsky warned you about. If you want to work on software, go to a software firm. If you want to just pay the bills and are not passionate about software, finance software is..well, read below.<p>I've worked in finance as a software engineer at several large investment banks for many years. The software consists of a mash-up of legacy stuff incorporated into generally very ""safe"" architecture choices. Unless you work in some highly specialized (and very rare) type of group, you won't be making any decisions as to what language to use, database, environment or any other project specific choices. They do not value the product. Expect no documentation of anything and consider it a gift if you ever see an internal wiki. While documentation may be the exception in some circles, any developer worth his salt knows the true value of writing stuff down, or at least commenting code, so you can come back to it at a later date. This isn't the type of software environment where they're going to appreciate the years you spent in school, learning how to measure time-complexity of various algorithms. For the most part, those algorithms are already written and those data structures have been decided upon for you. I literally have conceived maybe a handful of algorithms over the years.<p>You will spend your time maintaining hacked together code that was assembled by literally 30 other people who came and left before you. There will be little to no testing before software is deployed into production. You will likely not have an adequate test environment. If you are lucky enough to have a test environment, chances are that it won't resemble production in any meaningful way. This test environment may be called ""your development environment."" You will work with many people who do not understand, nor respect, the art of writing good software. You answer to ""the business,"" ie: traders. Traders for the most part, will not appreciate what you do. Its too nebulous for them, and most people not in tech at the IB, for that matter. I'll never forget when we rolled out our new auto-trading system and the IBank laid off several dozen traders that day.<p>Depending on how your group is organized, you may be on call 24/7. Some groups have coverage structures, with people covering production software in shifts. Expect to be interrupted on holidays. Expect to work on at least one of the following holidays every year: Xmas, New Years, Thanksgiving, Easter, any other national holiday. Projects will be scheduled poorly. Timelines will exceed aggressive-scheduling and wander into ""insane"" territory. This may be the norm, depending where you work. The quality of the software you write will suffer for it. Your lifestyle, health, social-life, family-life, interests, hobbies and life will all suffer for it as well.<p>Politics will rule everything. Politics will stifle your productivity, unless you have a great manager who keeps you away from all of it. Unfortunately, I've never met a great software manager in finance. I'm sure they exist, but I've never had one. There will be many meetings. The meetings will run on and on and many topics will be discussed that concern none of you, which could have easily been hashed out in minutes over email. But you will spend hours in meetings because thats the corporate attitude, and finance is as corporate as it gets. The excessive meetings will impact your productivity and result in regular 12-14 hour days, year-round. You'll have far less resources than you require to do the job even adequately, because the people making the decisions about funding view tech as a cost-center. You'll frequently realize, when you read hacker news, that there's a great many exciting things happening in software outside of the world of finance software. You will see none of these exciting things.<p>I know this seems like a long, negative entry, but I assure you - my experience was not unusual. I strongly caution anyone passionate about software against going into finance software. I've worked as a software engineer and (unusually) in the front-office on the trading side.",1349036850

So far nothing stalky about this. This is just someone who wants to know more about you or wants to strike a conversation with you.<p>Now, if this was a complete stranger who followed you to your locker to find out your name, has it tattooed in his or her butt, slept in his or her car outside of your house, etc, then yeah that's pretty fucked up.<p>But the fact that people look up what you make public about you isn't stalking.

As HN and Reddit and slashdot before them seep into the journalistic consciousness there are pretty clear efforts to craft a message based on selective sampling. By drilling into the sources for all the clips (unnecessary of course but bear with me) used to compose the 'call me maybe' video its clear that the President never set out to make this video or even knew the lyrics (probably does now though :-) and this slashdot article appears to be a lesser instance of the same effect. Pull a few bits out of context, wrap them together into a choice sounding narrative and blam! you've got a ""story.""<p>So to answer your question the 'telephone' you mention is simply 'spin doctoring' (to use the 20th century vernacular) and it will continue as long as people make long enough sound bytes in their communication that they can be re-purposed for spin without setting off too many alarms in the readership.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX1YVzdnpEc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hX1YVzdnpEc</a>",1349035518

Sure it is. However you don't have to learn all of it.<p>I never learned much about Swing, AWT, JSP, JSF, EJB, Struts, Spring, Hibernate and all that crap.

I remember trying to make MOD files play in Turbo Pascal, which left me with about 200k of memory for whatever else I wanted to do. I remember trying to read BMP files and because I had no available libraries, I had to implement the functionality by my own (and forget about GIFs or Jpegs). I remember trying to create a window with a button in Windows 3.11 and for some reason whatever I did was freezing my computer, so I had to reboot all over again, until finally giving up in agony.<p>I know at least one man that gave up on programming when the transition to Windows happened, because Borland Pascal was so goddamn awful for anything not involving a text interface running in 286 real mode - that it left that man with the impression that programming was not for him.<p>Yes, you can go from 0 to ""knowing turbo pascal"" in a short time.

This is faster than re-laying-out and re-drawing the web content directly (even if re-drawing the web content itself uses the GPU).  It's a good trade-off when you have animations that update every frame.<p>The biggest cost is memory.  Every pixel of hardware accelerated web content gets 4 bytes of memory.  This adds up quickly, especially since any content that overlaps hardware accelerated content must become hardware accelerated as well.<p>The other big cost, as olsn already pointed out, is that blending these offscreen images onto the screen takes time and power on every frame.

Finance can be a great way to start / springboard your career: I sharpened my analytical mind, saw how companies worked under-the-hood, really learned how to work hard and was able to save some money.   But as a long-term profession, at least in the area I was in, it's brutal.   The job took a huge toll on the people that stayed with the career for 5-10 years.  And like the author said, once you're making insanely great money it's hard to give that up.<p>When my (now wife) and I went to my going away party, she was approached by many of the other banker's wives.  They said they were so happy for her that I was leaving the industry, and expressed the difficulties the lifestyle presented to raising a family and relationships.  I loved the people I worked with - they were hard working, honest, great people.  But only an all-consuming industry could generate this kind of response from the families of my co-workers.<p>After my stint in banking, I  left to start my own company which I've been doing full-time for nearly five years.  And while banking provided the initial savings safety net to scale-up the business I couldn't imagine going back.

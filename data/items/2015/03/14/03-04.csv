9201496,comment,9201012,9201012,0,0,likeclockwork,,,"Wow, that article he was responding to is horrible.<p>There&#x27;s not really much point in arguing with people who only take name-brand operating systems and software seriously. They&#x27;ll always mask their elitism by feigning concern for so-called &quot;ordinary users&quot; or complain about the absence of some specific proprietary software package that they only had access to before by submitting to vendor lock-in.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s one magical OS that&#x27;s for everyone. Or one specific UI implementation or paradigm that is perfect for everyone. Yes, there have been strides in making Linux DEs that are approachable for people familiar with Windows but Linux (and Unix-like OSes as a whole, but particularly Linux) has value beyond being an alternative to any another OS.<p>When I first started using computers there was no &quot;easy mode&quot;.. a large proportion of my early time spent using a computer was spent learning about how that computer worked by exploration. There&#x27;s still no &quot;easy mode&quot;, if you haven&#x27;t learned how to learn about how systems work.. you won&#x27;t be able to troubleshoot any problems that may arise nor do anything you haven&#x27;t already been taught how to do.<p>&quot;Easy enough for everyone to use.&quot; is a slogan about sales volume. I think there are definitely Linux configurations that have those aspirations and are no further away from nor any closer to achieving them than Windows or OSX is. The value of Linux isn&#x27;t to be a clone or replacement for another OS. The value of Linux is that it is extremely learnable for people who are interested in computing and people who want to make their own choices about their software environment.<p>The common complaints people make about &quot;I had to use a CLI.&quot; or &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to learn anything.&quot; or &quot;There were problems.&quot; are pretty irrelevant. In days past you always had to use a CLI, you always had to learn things, and there were always problems.<p>The cursor in the shell is a question. It&#x27;s the system asking you what you want it to do. It&#x27;s not trying to entice you with shiny icons. Every time I read that question, I have to think about it, and sometimes when I&#x27;m not working on anything in particular an open terminal window can provide hours of entertainment and education.<p>Not everyone thinks the same way. (I, for example, cannot keep my computer orderly with a graphical file manager. I just can&#x27;t. I can reason about a written inventory of what I have but I can&#x27;t find anything in my closet.) Not everyone is going to do the same things.<p>I don&#x27;t know why people would damn a system with a completely different paradigm instead of just saying &quot;It&#x27;s not for me.&quot;<p>I also don&#x27;t know why anyone would fire up the most educational operating system that exists (my opinion, but I think it&#x27;s a big part of the reason that Linux is popular where it&#x27;s popular.. because at a certain level it is very easy to use (where use overlaps with learning heavily; such as solving hard problems)) if they didn&#x27;t want to learn anything.",1426305439

We&#x27;re both pretty new to web development, but we both have experience in the field of finance, and we&#x27;re learning every day. Basically our plan is to have a community driven investment strategy where people can research and vote on stocks they like, and then we invest in whatever is voted for. We&#x27;re planning to have an alpha out pretty soon to test the model with fake money, so if you&#x27;re interested sign up on the site!<p>A little me: I&#x27;ve been interning at quant hedge funds since the summer after my freshman year, working close to the model building process. While I have the utmost respect for the people building and testing the model, I was ultimately not impressed with the results. It&#x27;s just fundamentally hard to predict a system that changes its behavior every day. For a lot of quant funds the key to succeeding is marketing to people that you have &quot;the secret&quot; inside your black box, but, as many people suspect, no one has that firm a grasp on the &quot;truth&quot;. Instead we&#x27;d like to make the process honest and inclusive, and since the community builds the model, we&#x27;d like to let the community keep more of the profits. A normal hedge fund or mutual fund is going to charge you 2% of your total money invested per year and 20% of the returns you get, our goal is to do all this for 1/10th of that.<p>Suggestions are welcome.

People would have to refrain from abusing the global object, or snapshotting might fail.<p>I guess you&#x27;d need to add some extra restrictions, such as no top level code outside of functions including variable initialisers, and no modification of prototype chains. This seems hard to do with JS as it is written today. Perhaps the &quot;use strong&quot; experiment will make this easier.<p>> ES6 modules plus the asm.js work to avoid loading too much cold code is likely to bear more fruit than a new VM&#x27;s bespoke snapshotting tech<p>This is your intuition and opinion. Some people disagree, and have chosen to put their effort into another approach. Maybe you&#x27;re right. Maybe they&#x27;re right. Personally I think it&#x27;s better to try both approaches, and let benchmarks settle this. From the benchmarks I&#x27;ve seen, snapshots look very promising.<p>> Dart ain&#x27;t gonna replace JS in the foreseeable future<p>Flamebait! It doesn&#x27;t need to.

It was a pleasure insofar I was only a trainee and did not have to deal with the politics and all that. One day, a week before the first part of the web shop was scheduled to go live, the programmer I was working for came back from a meeting. Usually, he was pretty laid back person, very friendly and pleasure to work with/for. But when he came back from that meeting, he was <i>mad</i>, like, &quot;Hulk SMASH&quot; mad.<p>I asked him, as delicately as I could, what had happened.<p>This project we were working on, he told me, had been going on for about half a year, and during that time there had been a meeting every week, where everybody involved in the project had an opportunity to get together and review and discuss the progress of the project.<p>So there was this guy, who had only attended the very first of these meetings, without saying a single word. And the week before the thing is supposed to go live, he shows up again, with a long list of changes he wants to make to the application.<p>Needless to say, that programmer, and several other people in the room, told that guy how he had <i>six freaking months</i> to tell the programmers about his requirements, and the he could not possibly expect them to make all these changes a week before the application went live.<p>So that guy goes to the highest-ranking manager involved with the project, manages to pull some political strings, so that manager goes to this programmer&#x27;s boss, that boss goes to the programmer and tells him, &quot;I know how much it sucks, but you have to do this. I share your pain, but I, too, am powerless to refuse this request.&quot;<p>When building material things, it seems, houses or ships or airplanes or railraods or whatever, people do realize that you cannot tell, e.g. the construction company that you actually want a house with a circular outline rather than the rectangular one the company has been building for the last, what?, three months.  Managers at car companies, I guess, do not storm into the engineers&#x27; offices a week before production of a new car starts to tell them the vehicle not only needs to be small and fuel efficient, but also needs to be able to work in antarctic climate and run on carbon dioxide instead of gasoline.<p>With other products - at least, that is the impression I get - people have an intuitive or explicit understanding of the limitations of the things they want to have built, and they also seem to basically understand that you cannot make drastic changes at the last minute. With software, which does exist in the tangible way that, say, a car our house does, people seem to have a much harder time understanding those limitations. I am not sure this is the entire problem with software development, but it is a big part.",1426303497

But then, if it worked, it would simply ape DJs. What I want to do is different: a &quot;bot-flavored&quot; playlist generator. A DJ that pushes tracks one after the other in an interesting way, but not in a human way. For instance, my bot-jockey could rightly decide to play a classical music track just after some deep house, because some features are matching.

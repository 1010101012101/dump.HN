The biggest factor that led me to decide on a free app was the ability to gather some useful analytics. Publishing a paid app might make more money in the short term, but only get a total of a few dozen installs. Since this was my first app, I thought it would help to do some market research first. Now there are about 1000 active users which gives me a good indication of where to focus future development effort. :)",1308545911

Coining terms such as ""relentlessly resourceful"" and emphasizing constant and responsive iteration as a great key to success. All this has accentuated in my mind the impact that a cultures ethics/morals play in fostering entrepreneurial activity/success.<p>This ranges the gamut from honesty to thrift and security as all being elements that can impact a culture or communities start-up mojo.<p>Take, for example, my home of utah. Lots of tech savvy entrepreneurial minded folks. Yet, in my opinion, a hyper zealous thrift minded risk averse upper/upper middle class contributes (along with other factors I could name) to the problem of things like seed funding. People want to invest but their sensibilities keep them often from engaging in seed funding much of anything. (Most ideas of ""seed funding"" here seem to demand an already in the marketplace profit gaining gig)<p>So my question to you, where ever you are, is<p>""What are aspects of your community that you believe impact the entrepreneurial spirit/fostering of innovation?""",1308545609

2672923,comment,2672672,2672672,1,0,otoburb,,,"Perhaps this is the time where attempting to match your current interests with where you think your interests will be post-graduation would help. Are you in high-school or just about to finish up your Bachelors?<p>Specifically, Toronto seems to have a greater variation in the number and, presumably, types of firms that would seek out Comp Sci graduates. As an example, if you had an inclination to work within Finance tech, then your best bet by far would be Toronto since all the major financial firms and banks are located primarily in Toronto.<p>Alternatively, if you're interested in game development, I hear that Vancouver seems to have strong presence, mainly due to the influence of EA's Vancouver (Burnaby) location, with a vibrant startup scene. I haven't heard of other types of firms with a strong demand for CS in Vancouver other than gaming and startups.<p>I can't comment on Waterloo nor Montreal, except that they both seem to be continually growing tech hubs. RIM and UofW are strong reasons for the talent draws in the Waterloo region, and the Montreal startup scene seems quite lively.<p>From a salary perspective, most people tend to agree that Vancouver firms pay lower than Toronto equivalents. I can't comment on startup salaries since they're so specific to the situation (startup stage, equity vs. salary compensation considerations).<p>On a more personal note, although I agree that either city would make a fine home, I find Toronto highway traffic a complete mess compared to the Vancouver bridge bottlenecks. Tech events and gatherings tend to be located within downtown Toronto. A younger person will have more fun living downtown or in a subway accessible location. If your job is in Mississauga (due to the cheaper commercial lease rates), then from personal experience I can attest the commute will significantly bring down your quality of life.",1308545562

2672916,comment,2672619,2672619,1,0,egiva,,,"It's funny that if you agree that many programming languages suffer from a paradoxical ""shield of complexity"" like the author describes, than the obvious solution is better technology like natural language parsers, etc. (Ways to translate more common human expression into machine-specific coding). However, the technology to do that would be an order of magnitude more complex than what exists today, so the framework/base/foundation of technology needed to make day-to-day programming more accessible to everyone would also suffer from it's own perpetual ""shield of complexity"".<p>Whether you see the irony in that or not, is besides the point. Basically, arguments about programming being too complex are null and void if the technology needed to solve it would always be increasingly more complex.<p>Unfortunately, I think that's how history advances in general. At the time the printing press was invented, most people were unable to read and write. Reading and writing was a TECHNOLOGY accessible only to elites. Over time, that technology and associated skills become accessible to almost everyone, but based on even more advanced technology that enabled the masses to learn. The same might come to pass in regards to programming skills, where everyone in the future will be able to program, but a smaller crowd will be working on even more advanced stuff to allow us to all learn those skills, ad infinitum.",1308545278

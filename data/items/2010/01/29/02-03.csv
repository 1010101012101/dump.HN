Ford's Model T came with a small toolkit that contained all the tools needed to repair it.

Now, in addition to boring out heads or swapping engines, modern street rodders can tweak the fuel-to-air ratio with their laptops and install large-bore fuel injectors.<p>Hacking is something that will always be around.

Listening to instrumentals for the purpose of increased concentration is probably not the norm. Most people who listen to music while they run do so for the reason frederickcook stated: they'd be bored otherwise.<p>Or at least they'd claim it was boredom. Really I think it's the complete awkwardness of the absence of some sort of distraction, and it's just easier for people to say ""I'd get bored"" versus ""I'd feel so awkward"". However, on the other side of that initial awkwardness lies a new level of clarity. For me, the 45 minute mark on a slower-paced run is the only time I have better obvious-in-hindsight solutions than in the shower.<p>(that being said, working a demanding day job while planning my exit strategy into a startup leaves me no time to run...at a time in my life when I need that clarity most!)",1264732087

While integral in the effort, this is the easiest step in research.  What too many do not do is take the next step, which is the creation and evaluation of ideas.  In mathematics, one can think of it as depth first search through the space of knowns in hopes of finding a proof of an interesting statement.  To be continually successful, one must look at this proof discovery activity as a production step.<p>But the essay does not look at this as such, instead saying that inspiration does not come from producing.  By stating:<p><i>It wasn’t until I started running that I realized the value of doing neither [consumption nor production], but instead of processing the things I consumed.</i><p>It excludes mental rumination from production.

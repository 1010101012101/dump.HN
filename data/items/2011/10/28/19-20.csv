I read HN more for the comments than for the articles.  The comments frequently of higher quality than the articles.  I usually upvote early from the new page so that the topic will get wider discussion.  That means that not infrequently, I will upvote a mediocre article or one I disagree with to get the discussion going.  If necessary I'll throw in a comment saying why I think the article is off-base.<p>I would hate to be ranked as doing a disservice for what I am attempting to do.

Not so for most women. Remember, this is about emotions.<p>Is it really about emotions? I'm looking at the statistics for 2009/10 in my country[1] and it seems men are more than twice as likely to be murdered as women. I don't have statistics but I'd be quite surprised if women were actually more likely to be assaulted than men, particularly by non-partners, which is what we're talking about. Is the actual level of hazard not somewhat relevant, as well as the emotions? If (and you may disagree) the level of fear doesn't correspond to the level of hazard, is it not counterproductive to expound the idea that women are at constant risk of violence?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science-research-statistics/research-statistics/crime-research/hosb0111/?view=Standard&pubID=864212"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science-research-s...</a>",1319831457

When it comes to transportation, there are all sorts of levels of regulation (highway boards, transportation safety boards, municipal and regional codes) than you would think, and all like to regulate slightly different issues, and aren't very accessible to the average layperson.<p>The other thing I'd caution you about when trying to monetize this is that the local bus companies will almost certainly come after you, and will have legal teams who are used to fighting the minutae of transport law - so don't be surprised if you find yourself having to lawyer up with some very specialized (and hence, expensive) counsel.<p>As an example of both, here's ([1]) a story of a Canadian startup that was declared illegal by the Ontario Highway Transportation Board (a tribunal no Ontarian outside of the transportation sector has ever heard of) after the bus companies when after them. Seeing as it's in Canada that case shouldn't serve as a precedent, but does (as does the UberCab story) serve as an example about the challenges that come up when you try and disrupt something as established as the transpiration sector.<p>[1] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2008/11/12/ill-never-let-canada-live-this-down/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2008/11/12/ill-never-let-canada-live-t...</a>",1319831421

I can't easily build my own, special-purpose hardware because Intel, AMD, and other such companies control the process, and that's mostly due to the expense of today's silicon foundries being unaffordable to hobbyists. Even if I use the latest FPGAs, such as the Virtex-7 (#1), I am still limited by the underlying technology choices made by Xilinx, as well as by the high cost and continued availability of these high-end parts. I realize that the OP is about some cool work that is merely at the R&D stage, but the bottom-line message is that this could lead to a technique whereby ordinary mortals, albeit ones with (potentially homemade) STMs, could create their own circuitry. It's a pretty big deal if this work results in me being able to build, with relative ease, a huge CA array, upon which I can then apply, through programming, a wide range of computational topologies.<p>#1: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3162791"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3162791</a>",1319830977

The most prominent is the lack of awareness of joining a start-up as an achievable or even applicable career option.<p>NACUE, the business which I work on, encompasses a network of 40,000 enterprising students. And our biggest barrier is enabling students and grads to understand that are different modes of being entrepreneurial post graduation, and therefore 3 career options:\n1. Launching a company \n2. Being entrepreneurial whilst working for one of the big boys - an intrapreneur\n3. Joining a start-up team<p>The third has the greatest potential. Given the thriving start-up community in London and others areas, and still, the record graduate unemployment.<p>We're working on raising the awareness of the above problem. Looking to launch a programme next year - this can hopefully tie into the milkround.<p>Lastly, I don't think you need to be on campus. What we all need is to be visible, and that is achieved through networks (i.e. ADCAS, EEUK) and online, social media - that's where they're engaged.<p>I've promoted this across network - have a good one this weekend.

Though the summaries talk about ""sold to users"", the license itself defines ""sale"" in such a way as to include zero-cost distribution:<p>""Sale (Sell) (Sold) (Seller)  shall mean any sale, rental, lease, license, copying, transfer, reproduction, Transmission, or other form of distribution of an AVC Product or the Transmission by any means of AVC Video either directly or through a chain of distribution.""<p>This is consistent with the discussions I've been party to with the MPEG-LA directly.<p>Edited to add: I would very much appreciate a reference to MPEG-LA saying the things you indicate in your comment.

I'm not a car buff or an environmental buff, but having a real zero-emissions car that will help get rid of our dependence on oil just makes sense.<p>However, can any experts educate me on the status of the Li-ion battery?  My understanding is that Li-ion batteries lose 30% of their capacity over 2-3 years.  So what does that mean for the range of the Tesla cars?  My Honda Accord lasted 11 years and 200k miles, it doesn't sound like Teslas have nearly the same durability and range.  Is this a ticking time bomb, or is there a solution to this?",1319828629

Based on a question raised in the Ridejoy thread earlier, it was mentioned there that a service couldn't be a taxi service, presumably because of permit requirements. It also appears there's some Californian legislation that requires people commuting do so only to and from work and not leave state boundaries. I'm not a lawyer and I don't know the law in regards to this but these kind of guidelines seem a little strange to me. Is this commonplace? Could a service facilitate transactions between a person selling a seat and a person buying said seat or would that somehow be illegal?",1319828629

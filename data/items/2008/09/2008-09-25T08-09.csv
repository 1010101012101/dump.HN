314672,comment,312091,312289,0,0,13ren,,,"How to get sales in the first place? Assuming I'm understanding you correctly, that's the whole business problem, isn't it? It's (1). meeting a need (product for a market); (2). people knowing about it (publicity).<p>I won't theorize or exposit further, just give my own experience.<p>Mine was a product for programmers: I focused on creating a product that solved a problem that was frustrating and easy to solve. I began with the absolute minimum step towards that, set up a webpage, and released it on freshmeat. I used a dual license, meaning it was open source, but in some cases I could charge for it. I was prepared for there to be no interest, but there was <i>some</i> interest (500 people looked at it, and <i>1</i> emailed me).<p>Thus encouraged, I continued, adding features, and releasing each one as a new version.<p>A strange thing happened as I continued on this path - I saw a really cool way to do something that I had not even imagined before. I knew the components, but just didn't see the connection - maybe no else did... certainly, no one else acted on it. Seeing new things is not a matter of genius; it's a matter of <i>being there</i> - at the vantage point where it is visible. The other part is, having seen it, to <i>actually do it</i>.
This is really what made it worth paying for, for my very first sale.<p>Simultaneous with all this, I was fascinated by the idea of a ""pitch"", trying to succinctly capture: the  essence of the idea; the benefit to customers; and the advantages over alternatives. I constantly rewrote this - typically, weekly.<p>Summary: solved a frustrating problem with a neat solution that was constantly publicised via releases. Had a cool pitch, that was exciting and easy to grasp, and short enough to pass on to others by word of mouth. Kept working on the product regularly for a year before the first sale (it's reassuring for customers to see ongoing activity; and inspiring for technical users to see constant improvement).<p>So, <i>How to connect to users and make the initial sale?</i> Users knew about it, wanted to buy it, so they found a way to buy it. My initial customer had management that understood and appreciated the technology (and taught me a lot about it, in fact).<p>They sometimes needed permission, but <i>only one level up</i> (their immediate management). Sometimes permission would take 3 months. That was awful. Oh, and dealing with lawyers was awful (even though I respect lawyering, I didn't enjoy the experience). I also experimented with prices as I went along, and they ended up being 10 times what I started with (from $500 to $6,000 USD for top  end)... thus moving higher up the management chain for ""permission"".",1222331537
314671,comment,314294,314622,0,0,silencio,,,"Well yes. You can also pirate it and install on jailbroken phones (one of the only reasons I do so, since I never was able to purchase it).<p>Podcaster used a loophole in the adhoc distribution method that allowed for getting around the 100 device limit. Apple is now preventing that developer from doing so. I think Apple would probably go as far as to monitor who is using the adhoc distribution method to bypass the app store (since at the moment they'd get lots of publicity for doing so, as this is typically only for limited beta testing and the like) to disable their account in general. I can't see how Podcaster will be able to update anymore...<p>I know lots of people have been bringing up Cydia as a viable alternative, but it's not a storefront and Cydia will not last if the App Store becomes a failure as a result. But it may be one available and open solution for banned applications.",1222331513
314670,comment,314206,314530,0,0,PieSquared,,,"Somehow, that line just has a brilliant ring of truth to it: <i>Once a hacker, always a hacker.</i> And it's probably right. You can't go back to a life of normalcy after experiencing the exhilaration of hacking away at something for hours on end and finally getting it. What you can do, though, is apply your mind to the social system - as you said, hack it.<p>A lot of nerds and geeks (the ones I know at least) are unpopular not because they're unpleasant people (they aren't), but because they don't understand how the social system works, what you're allowed to say and what you aren't (and when). If you just watch people talking around you you can easily notice what annoys people or causes them to end the conversation, and avoid doing it. If you just apply your mind to everyday life, being involved in your surrounding culture really isn't that hard.",1222331430

It then goes on to say that shooting a ball straight in the air is the hardest to aim.<p>Therefore, you are to assume that you rather release the ball from a higher point to increae accuracy, since high angle=poor aim.<p>So, why not release the ball above your head instead of around your waist or chest???<p>I don't think we will see anyone shooting this way any time soon.<p>-d",1222331263

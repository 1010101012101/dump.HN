9744123,comment,9743259,9743300,0,0,mattheww,,,"This is not a very straight-forward question to answer. The short answer is that both CMS and ATLAS detected a couple thousand Higgs events.<p>The long answer depends on your definition of detected. As you probably know, the Higgs decays into many different combinations of particles. In some of these cases, we have very little chance of determining whether there was a Higgs in the event. In fact, only in H(iggs) -> ZZ -> 4l(eptons), do we stand a reasonably good chance of saying whether a specific event contains the Higgs. In this channel, CMS and ATLAS both observed ~20 events.<p>The next two most sensitive channels are H->WW->2l+2nu (neutrino) and H->2photon. In the most Higgs-enriched regions that have been constructed, the contribution from Higgs is ~10% in H->WW->2l+2nu and ~20% in H->2photon. So in these channels, we have very little chance to say whether a specific event contained a Higgs, but if we look at all the events, we see features that wouldn&#x27;t be present if there weren&#x27;t any Higgs bosons. The contributions from Higgs in these channels are a few hundred events in CMS and ATLAS.<p>Then there are even less sensitive channels, which means we have even less chance to say whether a specific event contains a Higgs. CMS and ATLAS probably detected a few hundred to a thousand or so events each in these channels.",1434715146

Or is there something else we should consider that kernel?<p>If we are not careful, then we can look to a modern myth, like the &#x27;myth of Superman&#x27;, and posit that the breakup of Krypton explains why there are meteorites.",1434714895

Their causal hypothesis is actually (if I&#x27;m reading it correctly) the reverse of the direction people are assuming from the headline: [other physical features of] social anxiety disorder may cause excessive serotonin production, which may in turn produce additional symptoms, rather than excessive serotonin production being the root cause. That is, unusual upregulation of some pathways involving serotinin sits more towards the end of a causal chain than at its beginning. (Some of these causal chains are more like feedback loops, though, which makes it extra difficult to sort out what constitutes a root cause.)<p>From the paper:<p>> Although we cannot test causal effects in the present study, we speculate that, because raphe nuclei serotonin 1A autoreceptors exert inhibitory feedback on serotonin synthesis and firing, downregulation of inhibitory raphe serotonin 1A autoreceptors previously reported in social anxiety and panic disorder leads to increased serotonin synthesis, and augmented reuptake may be a compensatory mechanism.<p>[1] <a href=""http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2319711"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=23197...</a>",1434714238

9744051,comment,9739170,9743634,0,0,dalke,,,"The problem is, the physical evidence shows that there was no such singular major cataclysm.<p>Could such evidence exist? Certainly. For example, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuruppak"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuruppak</a> mentions that &quot;At the end of the Uruk period [around 3100 BC] there was an archaeologically attested river flood in Shuruppak&quot;. This marks the end of the antediluvian rulers of the Sumerian King List. (See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_King_List#Antediluvian_rulers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_King_List#Antediluvia...</a> .) Therefore, there are physical remnants of a local flood from 5,000 years ago, which correspond to historical records. If there were a global flood then it too would leave physical traces.<p>Floods are not uncommon events. In some areas they occur yearly, in others they occur once a decade or one a generation. There are myths around the world which refer to the sun, to the moon, to storms, and to other natural events that were not singular in nature. Floods should fall in that local category.<p>You hypothesize that &#x27;we all spoke the same language&#x27; before this event.<p>The Chinese flood myth concerns events that took place about 2200 BCE, and emphasizes how human efforts were able to mitigate its effects. (See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Flood_%28China%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Flood_%28China%29</a> .) This is 1,000 years after the flood in Shuruppak.<p>We have written records of Egyptian, Sumerian, and Eblaite, dating from before 2300 BC. Indeed, the Early Dynastic Period of Egypt started about 1,000 years before the Chinese flood.<p>Therefore, the Chinese flood myth cannot be about an event which occurred when all humanity shared a common language.<p>Therefore it cannot be the case that all great flood myths refer to the same singular event at you describe. Which means we cannot look to the comment element - a large flood - in order to make an inference that there was a singular event. We would have to use other common elements, and there are no other world-wide common elements.",1434713631

I&#x27;ve heard the phrase &quot;that was his Waterloo&quot; but never known really what it meant.<p>My knowledge of Napoleon changed when this week I watched a TV program on the BBC praising him as a great leader, and another kids program which seemed even handed merely telling his history. I didn&#x27;t even know that it was Wellington[&#x27;s army] who faced off against Napoleon, despite Wellington being a name I&#x27;ve known since my earliest years [rubber boots which nearly all UK kids have are called &#x27;Wellington boots&#x27;].<p>I&#x27;ve never seen Waterloo lauded or celebrated in Britain. YMMV I&#x27;d be interested to hear other perspectives, perhaps I&#x27;ve missed out?<p>By chance I happened to watch a recent show, again on the BBC this week, that included an aspect of the Battle of Waterloo - there I learnt 2 things: it was in Belgium and the British were surprised to win, the battle being extremely close. It was a fictional work but presented the battle as a very narrow victory and without celebration.<p>For my part I see now in Britain an undercurrent of feeling that the disparity between the haves and the have-nots is too great that seems to me like a continuation of the feeling that fomented the French revolution. As an ordinary Brit coming to this topic afresh I kinda see Napoleon as &quot;our man&quot; to some extent.

Talking to strangers, an alien concept in most coffee shops today, was actively encouraged. Dudley Ryder, a young law student from Hackney and shameless social climber, kept a diary in 1715-16, in which he routinely recalled marching into a coffeehouse, sitting down next to a stranger, and discussing the latest news. Private boxes and booths did begin to appear from the late 1740s but before that it was nigh-on impossible to hold a genuinely private conversation in a coffeehouse.<p>As each new customer went in, they’d be assailed by cries of “What news have you?” or more formally, “Your servant, sir, what news from Tripoli?” or, if you were in the Latin Coffeehouse, “Quid Novi!” That coffeehouses functioned as post-boxes for many customers reinforced this news-gathering function. Unexpectedly wide-ranging discussions could be twined from a single conversational thread as when, at John’s coffeehouse in 1715, news about the execution of a rebel Jacobite Lord (as recorded by Dudley Ryder) transmogrified into a discourse on “the ease of death by beheading” with one participant telling of an experiment he’d conducted slicing a viper in two and watching in amazement as both ends slithered off in different directions. Was this, as some of the company conjectured, proof of the existence of two consciousnesses?&quot;<p><a href=""http://publicdomainreview.org/2013/08/07/the-lost-world-of-the-london-coffeehouse/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://publicdomainreview.org/2013/08/07/the-lost-world-of-t...</a>",1434712974

For example the creation account in Genesis was regarded as metaphorical at least as far back as St Augustine&#x27;s time, 1600 years ago (Augustine supports what he calls a literal interpretation, but that means that each thing in genesis has a specific real life counterpart - so each of seven days corresponds to some kind of undefined epoch). Revelations is clearly metaphorical if you read up on the obvious contemporary references it contains. American Evangelical style biblical literalism is a heresy of the modern era - hardly a sign that scientific knowledge is encouraging progress.<p>Agreed that Evangelical literalism is ridiculous. However, even taken allegorically the genesis myth adds nothing to what we know about the Universe.

Both terms redirect to &quot;first language&quot; on Wikipedia, or what linguists refer to as &quot;L1&quot;.<p>edit: Oh! The sentence was meant to be parsed that it was more than 50 million speakers per each of the 23 languages, not more than 50 million for the whole 23 languages combined. Man that was difficult for me to parse. I thought it was trying to say something about the difference between mother and native tongues.",1434711952
9743996,comment,9741625,9742662,0,0,vidarh,,,"You can turn off disk persistence in Redis. My main usage of Redis is with disk persistence turned off (it handles a few hours worth of samples of data that we don&#x27;t care if we lose - we care about having long term averages only of the data in question).<p>There should be minimal overhead from having the capability in Redis due to the way it implements disk snapshots (RDB snapshots are done by fork()&#x27;ing and relying on copy on write to let the main process keep on doing its thing while the child process writes the snapshot, so the main process doesn&#x27;t need to care; other than that Redis offers logging/journalling of changes, but the cost of having that as an option is trivial if it&#x27;s switched off).<p>Having pluggable backends for things like Postgres or DynamoDB seems a bit at odds with the purpose of Redis, which is exactly that you pay the (very low) cost of in-memory manipulation of simple data structures, though if a single Redis server could partition the key space between plugins, it might potentially be useful by letting you e.g. move keys between backends and still access them transparently to the client. E.g. for the samples I mentioned above, we roll up and transfer data to a CouchDB instance for archival now (doesn&#x27;t matter that it&#x27;s CouchDB really - we just need a persistent key-value store; Postgres or DynamoDB would also both have worked fine), but if I could archive them while still having them visible in a Redis-like server together with the in-memory keys, that&#x27;d make the client a tiny bit simpler.<p>For most Redis usage, I think paying the cost of connection setup and teardown and sending HTTP headers etc. would likely slow things down immensely. At least it would for my usage. Having a HTTP interface as an addition might be useful in some scenarios to enable new use cases, but as a <i>replacement</i> for the current Redis API would be a disaster.<p>If you want to explore alternative interfaces, I&#x27;d instead suggest going in the opposite direction, and experimenting with a UDP interface. In a typical data centre setting packet loss is low enough that while you&#x27;d need retry logic, it wouldn&#x27;t necessarily get exercised much in normal situations.<p>(On the other hand, for the typical request/reply cycle it might very well not give any benefits vs. tcp in most scenarios where multiple request/replies are done over a single connection and thus amortising the connection setup cost - would be interesting to benchmark, though)",1434711928

So:<p>Summary of fundamental attribution error: If you're pointing at people and saying ""It's not the circumstances, it's you,"" often enough it is actually the circumstances.<p>You will be performing ""correspondence inference"" when supported by evidence and committing ""fundamental attribution error"" when not supported. To avoid fundamental attribution error you need to take care to obtain sufficient evidence.

This is what I'm wondering about.<p>I read this engadget review:<p><a href=""http://www.engadget.com/2013/04/30/google-glass-review/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engadget.com/2013/04/30/google-glass-review/</a><p>and don't see anything where I'd prefer Glass over a phone.<p>There was a lot of voice stuff, similar to Siri, and Google's implementation may be better, buy it's not clear to me where the heads up display adds a lot of value over voice response, or voice response plus looking at your phone.<p>The biggest drawback to me is the very limited, 2D controller paradigm.  It sounded a lot like the kind of UIs you see for DVD players, where you mainly navigate through Left/Right (and occasionally Up/Down) buttons.  Versus the touch screen paradigm of being able to select and manipulate objects directly.<p>To me, this leaves a very narrow range of use cases where something like Glass provides the optimal user experience.  Something where you need a display, but it takes too long to take your phone from your pocket, where a two way navigation UI suffices, and having to reach up to your temple to control it is not too awkward.  Or a voice UI, where something more than a voice response is needed (otherwise, phone plus Siri like capability plus audio headset would suffice).<p>I'm sure these applications exist.  I don't think any of the applications described in the Engadget review fit the bill.<p>So, as a Glass tester, tell me what I am missing.  What are you seeing as the big wins of using Glass over just using your phone?",1367816098

There is nothing ""unguided"" about them. They are pre-programmed, with crossover functions, fitness measures, etc. As the OP mentioned, they operate within relatively simple, well-defined ""environments"". They are effectively used as a heuristic tool for searching solution sets to defined problems.<p>Also, no one claimed that it's inherently impossible to derive greater complexity from lesser complexity. That's a straw man. Still, just because it's possible doesn't mean it has actually happened or has any bearing whatsoever on the facts (actual evolution). But, beyond that, GAs are not purposed with ""deriving complexity"", nor is that a desirable result in their application.

Once something is established that is simple and works, it becomes widespread and indoctrinated into society, and it takes an improvement of not just huge gains, but monumental gains to change people's behavior.<p>I think a lot about how many designs we accept as completely evolved that may not necessarily be ideal but trade perfection for universal understanding which is apparently more valuable.<p>EDIT: This section annoys me:<p><i>Theres a somewhat related theory that credits Remingtons pre-merger business tactics with the popularization of QWERTY. Remington didnt just produce typewriters, they also provided training courses  for a small fee, of course. Typists who learned on their proprietary system would have to stay loyal to the brand, so companies that wanted to hire trained typists had to stock their desks with Remington typewriters. Its a system thats still works today, as illustrated by the devout following Apple built through the ecosystem created by iTunes, the iTunes store, and the iPod.</i><p>That example makes no sense to me.

The idea is that it will often help you avoid having to rediscover all those complexity classes by trial and error when looking at systemtap traces or time stamps in the log stream.<p>For example in real-time systems picking a btree vs a hash based data-structure might work better sometimes since there is a less of a chance of a sudden spike related to hash re-sizing, instead there is a small penalty to be paid during insertion. I believe that. Have I actually measured that? No. Because it would involve re-writing a bunch of code and it would take time. So I don't know if  big-O had saved my ass here.<p>That is just one example.<p>Or say when when it comes to large data storage, knowing the base data structure used in the database will give you some expectation as to how it behaves  when the size grows.<p>All that said, it is hard to point back in 7+ years and say, aha, I know exactly how many times knowing big-O saved me from spending extra time and effort debugging.

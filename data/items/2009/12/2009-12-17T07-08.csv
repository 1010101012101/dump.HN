1000634,comment,1000303,1000527,0,0,Maktab,,,"In all fairness, the team at Adept Airmotive completed the majority of the design and development of their new engine platform with only private equity funding. They received an injection of cash from a state innovation fund a couple years ago to ease their way into production, but this has definitely not been a 'grandiose engineering project with government money'.<p>I do think they have a fairly good chance of succeeding with this, if only because their ambitions are fairly modest (they're seeking to build a better GA piston engine, not re-invent the industry) and because they're filling a fairly obvious gap. Their calculus, which seems sound, is that the low initial purchase cost and significant fuel savings will result in a TCO that's lower than what their competitors can offer even with more frequent service intervals until the engine becomes established.<p>The Rooivalk is a poor comparison, being as it was a hugely ambitious project initiated during a period when the country was under an arms embargo and unable to acquire such aircraft from outside. It was hamstrung in the end by the combination of an evaporating need (the country's involvement in Angola had ceased in 1989) and the concurrent slashing of the defence budget which elongated the development process, increased the unit cost and resulted in marketing opportunities being lost. But it's important to understand that it was originally designed to fulfill a local need, not for export, and that not only was the project an engineering success which established companies like Aerosud and ATE (both doing quite well) but its development made sense under the circumstances at the time. Similarly, SA had ambitious projects for an indigenous tandem trainer, the ACE, and an indigenous 4th-generation jet fighter under Project Carver, both of which fizzled out once the embargo ended and funding was decreased.<p>I won't quibble about the Joule though, which is admittedly a bit of an odd investment. South Africa was one of the research leaders in Lithium-ion battery technology prior to '92, but has done very little research in the field since then. Nevertheless, perhaps investing in high-tech industries with lots of automation does make sense for the country, as its cost of labour comparatively high and not competitive with other developing countries while it has a fairly active and effective scientific and engineering institutional infrastructure. And again, because Optimal Energy only exists thanks to government funding, they're a poor comparison to Adept Airmotive.<p>In terms of your last point, the Ravin 500 mentioned in the article is pretty close to what you're talking about, as it's a fairly simple composite aircraft improving on the basic design of the Piper Comanche but without re-inventing any technological wheels. Although it's being used as a test platform by Adept Airmotive, all Ravins sold to date have been equipped with more conventional Lycoming engines.<p>See: <a href=""http://www.saravin.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.saravin.com/</a>",1261036040

The buses come at irregular intervals and are regularly clumped together in order to maximize the time between service.  nextmuni is unreliable more than about 5 minutes in advance.  A trip which takes 18 minutes in a car requires me to leave 50 minutes beforehand in order to reliably arrive at work on time.  The drivers let any drugged out piece of shit on board, so you aren't particularly safe (I've been involved in two fights on muni, neither of which I started, both of which I was involved in simply for being on the bus).  The public transport is so poorly laid out that you not only have to plan your entire life around the schedule, but there are relatively close pieces of the city -- eg 20 minute walks -- that require 60+ minutes to reach via public transport.  Tthe lazy morons that run muni can't even get displays on market -- down which run many bus lines -- announcing the next buses.<p>This city -- and I never thought anything could do this -- is going to drive me to buy a car.

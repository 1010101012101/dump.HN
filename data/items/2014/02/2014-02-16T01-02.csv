It&#x27;s that they won&#x27;t get it back in a form that really works for them.  If I were to offer a VC an investment plan that would mean reliable payments of 30% of what they invested every year starting in five years and continuing forever, that would not be an attractive deal.  Would they get their investment back many times over?  Sure.  But the thing is, it wouldn&#x27;t happen all at once as a large payoff.",1392515933

7246314,comment,7244109,7244109,3,0,Ryel,,,"I started software development recently, and coming from the restaurant industry it&#x27;s extremely hard to wrap my head around the way most people in the tech industry think when it comes to work ethic.  Personally I think it has a lot to do with being spoiled with an over-abundance of jobs.  Most of you are very comfortable and wouldnt be worried about finding work if you were fired tomorrow.<p>In the restaurant industry it is part of the culture that no successful chef rises from the trenches of building a well-regarded establishment working less than 60-70 hours a week.  That is the minimum.<p>I&#x27;ve worked nearly every position in the restaurant biz (I love the industry and would do it everyday if it paid anything decent) including a couple well-regarded NYC places where I worked consecutive 100+ hour weeks for extended periods of time, 24 hour shifts, and often times ended up sleeping somewhere in the restaurant so instead of spending an hour to get home and an hour to come back, I could use 2 extra hours of sleep. When I was 17 I saved a paycheck with 112 hours on it.<p>At almost 21 now and having recently completely left the industry (except for occasional catering gigs) I was up until recently still working consecutive 70-90 hour weeks.<p>It&#x27;s likely because Im young and maybe naive but the appeal for me has always been the camaraderie and for the life of me I cannot find that in a startup.  I&#x27;ve interviewed in person with over a dozen startups now in Manhattan and Brooklyn and I&#x27;ve turned down offers from the majority of companies I interviewed with because at 5pm, they all turn off their computers and go home.<p>I want to work with a team that&#x27;s put all their chips into the company. Financially, physically, emotionally.  I want the blood, sweat, and tears that make up the restaurant industry.  Not because I think my hours are &quot;cool&quot; or &quot;impressive&quot; because I know I wont be able to maintain those hours as I get older and have real commitments.  For now what I want is a team that has it all on the line.  I know the risks are high but I know the reward is higher, the friendships that come out of those experiences have always been the strongest ones for me and the experiences have taught me how to handle the worst.<p>As I get older I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll come to learn the differences between being paid for physical labour and being paid to develop software. Eventually I&#x27;ll be in the same boat as most of you but for now I&#x27;ll continue to work a 12 hour day and wakeup excited to check my emails and excited to hack on the next feature for my next side-project.",1392515615

That first year was really rough on us (we started with 1 child and had another in the middle of that year), but we survived and watching that company burn was one of the most valuable life lessons I&#x27;ve ever had.  We&#x27;ve had another two kids since then, and I&#x27;ve learned a few other things along the way.<p>Before I was married, all of those fears and anxieties ruled my life. I think that&#x27;s partly what attracted me to the startup world and ultimately to starting that company.  I wanted to chase my ambitions and fight that feeling of loneliness.  However, the great lesson I learned from that company, and ultimately from the last few years of marriage and kids is that you won&#x27;t be alone when you choose to value the people you love over achievements you earn, stuff you buy, or even just stuff you work really hard on.  I poured it on with the 90 and 100 hour weeks the last 6 months of that company and in the end the company crumbled and my hard work left me with nothing but bitterness toward my creation (I eventually got past the bitterness).  Today I invest that time in my wife and my kids, and they are my world to me.  They&#x27;re my best friends.  There&#x27;s no earning their love, but the time I spend with them is never wasted.  I don&#x27;t get through the week, having prioritized them over other things, and think to myself &quot;man, I really wish I&#x27;d spent an extra 20 hours on that personal project&quot; that will never do anything for my personal fulfillment beyond some temporary ego boost.<p>Now.  That&#x27;s not to say I don&#x27;t still love the startup and technology world.  I do.  And I still have those personal projects. And that professional community.  I also love working hard on stuff that pushes the envelope.  But the funny thing is that ever since I put that part of myself in a bounded box I&#x27;ve enjoyed it more and been more productive.  There isn&#x27;t the sense of having to keep up, and yet I&#x27;m still able to.  Consequently I&#x27;m happier at work and since I don&#x27;t draw my personal worth from it, I can take setbacks and move on and still enjoy it.<p>I don&#x27;t know that everyone should get married, but it seems to me that, based on everyone I&#x27;ve ever known, that you best fight loneliness by surrounding yourself with people who will stick by you regardless of job, religion, social status , health, or anything else.  To me, the question to ask is - if the world fell apart right now, would the people you prioritize still be with you?",1392514803

This involves not talking to people, not going to meet new people, and not talking about things you find meaningful with those people. This is a set of actions: it is either done by choice (not a problem) or due to some other underlying problem, like a lack of time/effort, depression, fear of social vulnerability, anxiety, or a lack of interpersonal skills. The reason we call these things underlying is because they represent tangible actions that can be taken by the victim of loneliness or someone else to fix the problem<p>Then there is loneliness the emotion, which might exist separate of the actual lack of socialization described above... existential loneliness perhaps... but most often is cause by the above.",1392514468

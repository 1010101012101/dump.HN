We don't really have any idea what kind of investigation was conducted, or what other steps they have taken before this point. I don't imagine police in most democratic societies -- especially ones with robust free presses -- conduct raids lightly.<p>Furthermore, it's not really the police's job to interject possibilities into this situation. Phrases like ""digital forensics are crap -- way to easy to forge"" and ""If the ISP employees are the criminals then getting a wiretap for the customer's IP address that they've been spoofing is going to tip them off"" and ""if you know enough about Tor to set up an exit node"" don't really enter into their though process. The investigation reached a dead end, they got more evidence.<p>I would like to point out that <i>I</i> don't know the specifics of this case either. I will say, however, that in the US, raids and seizures like this are subject to judicial review. Probable cause is shown and permission is granted or denied. It's not as if the police can just walk in there and take what they want. I also don't feel that police work needs to be held up in the face of new technologies. As the public's access to technology increases, so must law enforcements access to tools to investigate crimes.  This is not to say there should not be checks and balances, but that <i>getting a warrant</i> already is a check.",1354316348

Calling these things ""consumer protection laws"" affords them more protection than they may be deserving of, because who doesn't like protecting consumers?  It just sounds like a great thing to do.<p>Calling your law a ""consumer protection law"" is (or rather, can be) basically a more advanced form of naming your law cleverly enough that it forms a ""patriotic"" acronym.",1354316237

Stripe tells you whether these checks fail, but will still process the payment anyway.<p>- Unusually large payments. For some reason we often see suspicious credit card payments of exactly $100. Maybe they're just testing if a stolen credit card works?<p>- Payments for very new customers, or for customers that aren't actively using our service yet. Our service has a free plan for testing, so most real customers don't pay immediately.<p>- Same credit card used on multiple accounts. We store Stripe's card fingerprint for each account so we can easily search our database for duplicates.<p>- Multiple payments in a short amount of time.<p>When someone tries to submit a payment, we create a ""customer"" record on Stripe and test their credit card first without charging it. If the customer looks suspicious, our servers send us an email and save a record for the pending charge in our database. Then we can investigate further and either process the charge on Stripe or delete it. If the customer is legitimate after all, we'll mark their account as trusted so any future payments will be processed automatically.",1354316214
4855936,comment,4855162,4855162,3,0,konstruktor,,,"IANAL, TINLA. I just had a look at the law concerning service providers (E-Commerce-Gesetz - E-Commerce Law) in Austria. It is quite liberal in its definition of a service provider, i.e. it does not only cover commercial service providers, and does not require any kind of license, but basically defines a service provider as a personal or legal entity that ""provides a service of information society"". Also, it contains several clauses that give providers immunity for the data they store and transmit. However, one explicit requirement is that the provider may not change any of the content transmitted to claim immunity. I am very interested in seeing whether the decryption/encryption of the data will prevent him from claiming immunity.<p>I want to add that Austrian law is very strict when it comes to the presumption of innocence. The right of a suspect not to be named, shown on a picture or otherwise identified is almost abolute (the only exception are suspects on the run, where this could help apprehend them). As an Austrian, I found it very disturbing to read the guy's full name in the ars article, something local media would not be allowed to do. If he is lucky and found innocent in court, the top search result with his name will forever be the ars article.",1354316162

Then, create a second protocol - say HMWP (HTTP Multiplexed Wire Protocol) (not a real protocol, I just made that up) that focuses on pipelining, server-push, header compression, etc. This layering approach really feels more ""internetty"". It also would allow independent development in terms of network optimization and application handling.<p>This split would also help adress conflicts between Cache/Proxy/Balancer developers and Application developers.",1354316134

4855927,comment,4854483,4855267,2,0,saurik,,,"No, nested comments are <i>not</i> part of ""the"" spec (in a way that would imply ""the e-mail spec""); sure, they are a feature of ""a"" spec, but that spec is actually somewhat unrelated to what an e-mail address actually is: they are just a feature of the MIME specification for header field values.<p>If you look at the SMTP specification (which, given that it defines the protocol in charge of using e-mail addresses for actual delivery has a much better claim to being ""the"" spec), you will note that you aren't allowed to use an e-mail address with nested comments in that context, as they have no meaning to SMTP.<p>However, you will also find that the rules for what characters are allowed and which have to be <i>escaped</i> are different, as that's what these specifications are actually discussing: how to <i>escape</i> an e-mail address for use with specific transport protocols.<p>An actual e-mail address? It seems to support pretty much anything followed by an @ followed by a domain name. It is just that in MIME, if you want to have a space character you will need to put it in quotes, or if you want a quote you will need to use a backslash.<p>The user of your web form, of course, is not typing MIME: there is a box that they can just type their e-mail address into, and it should probably support the raw syntax of their actual e-mail address, not a randomly chosen format required for escaping.<p>To make this more clear, one has to ask: why MIME escaping? Why not require the user to use HTML attribute escape sequences? That way, if their e-mail address contains a special character, instead of using quotation marks and backslash escaping, they'd use entities, like ""&quot;"".<p>Honestly, that makes about as much (if not more) sense. Meanwhile, of course, the user's username and password fields should also be escaped similarly, and if the user attempts to the use a bare < or > they should get a validation error ""please escape your password using RFC1866 (HTML)"".<p>Previous, more detailed versions of this same complaint:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4794368"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4794368</a><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4486872"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4486872</a>",1354315990

The media content only has to be discovered a single time then it basically stops being scares and can be easily made available to everyone. It's fanciful to imagine but I could see movie or music ""universities"" popping up to create this kind of content. I wonder how appropriate funding through grants and the like would be though?

The older a city is, the more people want it to stay the same because they bought their property based on a certain set of assumptions, like a place being a quiet neighborhood or so.<p>Property owners do have an interest in the use and enjoyment of their property, and it is they, rather than government itself, that tend to raise a fuss when new construction is proposed. After all, local government makes quite a lot of money from new construction - permit fees, increased spending by construction workers, increased tax revenue on the newly developed property, and so forth. Likewise, politicians get donations from developers, and often larger ones than from residents since developers have deeper pockets. On the other hand, developers only have one vote each and tend to be outnumbered by residents, whose interests often prevail for this reason.<p>If you own your own home, you would probably not be thrilled if the lot next door was suddenly the site of a ten-story apartment building without you being consulted or compensated.

But that is just one app, and probably the least interesting one to the general market of drivers out there.\nWe think the majority of the other apps that we and the dev community will build will only need basic info like odo reading, speed, on/off ignition states and what gear the car is in. So much can be done with that when blended with data from the device's accelerometer, GPS, etc.\nJay<p>Thanks for the very informed thinking on this! Great dialog.",1354313876

For ""normal"" users there's a dozen different ways to navigate and sort by album. But for playlist users there's now only one view - a text list - and a demoted tool menu on the bottom. Even command keys (i.e. Cmd-N) have been changed. Instead of just making a new playlist it changes the entire app view and the only available action is adding full albums to a playlist.<p>The only part worse is that I can't restore iTunes 10 via Time Machine without restoring my entire system.",1354313058

Now any important mail or receipts I need archived I just scan them and they're in evernote forever.<p>And their iPhone app is a life saver, anything I need on the go, I retrieve from evernote.

4855706,comment,4853816,4853816,2,0,Natsu,,,"> Once a popular piece of informationsay, a movie, a song, or a software title""leaks"" into the darknet, stopping its spread becomes practically impossible. This, the engineers realized, had an important implication: to prevent piracy, digital rights management had to work not just against average users, but against the most tech-savvy users on the planet. It only takes a single user to find a vulnerability in a DRM scheme, strip the protection from the content, and release the unencrypted version to the darknet. Then millions of other users merely need to know how to use ordinary tools such as BitTorrent to get their own copies.<p>There are quite a few people out there who <i>still</i> don't understand this, who believe that a ""speedbump"" will work.  They see things like SatTV protection schemes that are intact because people want content and they're not going to take the hard way out until they have to.  Like how the PS3 got hacked once there was an incentive to.<p>I even remember one specific conversation with a security expert here on HN telling me about how good the PS3's security was DRM working.  I predicted it would get hacked when necessary.  This was not long before the hack.  But it's a fundamentally biased prediction: I only needed on lucky break in the security to be right while they had to be perfect for me to be wrong.<p>That fundamental asymmetry, however, is exactly what makes the part I quoted work.",1354313029

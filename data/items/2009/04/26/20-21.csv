It's almost a Part 2 of K&R and covers building problems and the Unix signal and file APIs.

The article states that this means that ~26% of the US population has broadband. But does one subscriber equal one person?<p>I read 'subscriber' as 'person in the household that pays the bill'... multiple people may be using that account.<p>If you click through to the OECD numbers, you'll find the following:<p><pre><code>  Rank  Country        Subscribers/100 people\n  1     Denmark        36.7\n  6     Sweden         32.3\n  7     S.

I was trying to bite off too big a chunk at once, so I'd get confused and wouldn't know where to start.<p>3.) The task is really boring and takes no real skill to complete, so I just wouldn't bother.<p>#1 is fixed by backing up and doing something easier - and oftentimes the ""something easier"" ends up being far more useful than the original task.  For example, I spent like 3 years on FictionAlley.org (a PHP/MySQL rewrite of a website that had previously been 40,000 hand-written HTML pages), vs. a week on Scrutiny (Amherst's course-evaluation system).  Once I'd done Scrutiny, though, FictionAlley was quite a bit easier for the practice.<p>#2 is tricky until you get some practice in breaking things down, but then it becomes quite manageable.  For example, I was starting a new project for work this morning, one of those unsolicited I'll-build-it-and-then-show-my-manager things.  Spent a half hour or so doing nothing but checking HN, then I created a git repository and figured ""Hey, I can create a Django app.  That's no problem.""  Then I figured ""Hey, I create a basic HTML page with just the app's name on it.  That's no problem.""  Then I figured ""Hey, I can wire it up with django.views.generic.simple.direct_to_template"", and suddenly I've got working code that just needs to be refined.  The rest should be smooth sailing.<p>#3 is best solved with habits and routines, so that it really does become thoughtless.  For example, I think paying bills and opening mail is about the most boring thing ever, so I always do it Saturday morning before going to the supermarket.  It gets done, and since it's always at the same time of week I usually don't have to think about it.  Same with responding to e-mail - usually, I make sure to respond immediately after reading or else not respond at all.<p>The smoke and mirrors can be quite useful.  It works for me, at least.",1240776768

A good knowledge of C is a very valuable asset for all sorts of work, especially on Unix.<p>Thankfully, C is straightforward to learn. The major concept you need to understand is pointers; once you've done that, there are some syntactic oddities to absorb (typedefs, function pointer syntax, arrays vs. pointers), and you should skim through the standard library (which is tiny compared to Java, or even C++), and you're most of the way there.<p>In addition to K&R, I've hears that Steele and Harbison's ""C: A Reference Manual"" is very good, although I haven't read it personally.",1240776284

It covers the last century using almost entirely primary source texts--interesting primary source texts--since there's surely no better way to learn what Mao was saying than to read what Mao was saying.  For a more analysis-based approach, there's also Schoppa's ""Revolution and its Past.""<p>Today's China, regardless of its successes, is in part the result of many years of mistakes, some avoidable, some not, which have led to all sorts of problems.  A somewhat telling example is the case of scientific research.<p>The Communists were always obsessed with science and technology, especially Mao, as they realized its critical importance in terms of becoming a world power, and it fit their worldview in terms of the importance of production.  But Mao was also deeply distrusting of intellectuals, which didn't fit well with the concept of institutionalized science for obvious reasons.  Mao also strongly disagreed with the concept of ""basic research""--that is, research that advances the core knowledge of science--research necessary for future, more-applied research.<p>Today, despite decades of attempts to increase the number of graduates in technical fields and improve science, the current system is surprisingly awful.  They spend enormous sums of money on new facilities and then don't even have the funds to staff them.  Scientists quickly learn to focus on publishing as many papers as possible for recognition, even if it means making each individual one nearly useless.  There are very very few first-class scientists relative to the number of researchers as a whole--and much like the situation 60 years ago, many of these first-class researchers were trained abroad anyways.  Despite enormous expenditures, Chinese science is still, to some extent, going nowhere.<p>One theory is that the Chinese government still doesn't fully understand how science works--that you cannot merely throw money at big, expensive labs and have discoveries just ""happen.""  Often it seems like here in America the politicians don't understand this either...",1240776229

You can really see what's going on with the stack, what a pointer really is (pointers are really the only tough part about learning C, everything else will be the same old same old if you already know how to program), and the difference between a system call and a regular function call, and it doesn't take much time to learn.<p>Books by W. Richard Stevens were old when I was learning, and older now, but they were the best guides to taking it to the next levels.  You can pick up a lot of tricks and stylistic pointers from him while learning about UNIX features and networking.

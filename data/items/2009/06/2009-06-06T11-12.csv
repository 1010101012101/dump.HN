They're having contestants try to determine how people would rate movies, based on the corpus's collective ratings. From a business standpoint, it might be better to focus on which movies people would like that they haven't seen.",1244288822

Prof. Motwani was more than happy to sit down with him for almost an hour and give him career advice. Being so open and helpful to strangers while being so successful is a rare trait and a sure indicator of greatness.<p>May his family find the strength to get through this tragedy.",1244288796

If you want to start programming the part on the server side, I would propose to study ""data modeling"" first. If you do not even know what ""entity"" means, your backend is probably going to a permanent construction site.
If you are not able to ""design"" a good fundament it doesn't really matter what programming language you are going to use. 
Choosing/switching the programming language is the easy part - in my opinion.",1244287248

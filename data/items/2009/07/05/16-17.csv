It's really, really hard to do. Jack Welch, one of the better HR people of all time, said his hiring success rate was only 2 out of 3 hires working out even towards the end of his tenure. It's really hard to identify good people, know how they'll change and adapt over time, create a good environment for them, and so on. Vastly under ratedly hard. One of the reasons good people are underpaid is that it's often quite hard to tell them apart from ""just okay"" people. People are bad at picking talent - they mistake overconfidence and gregariousness for ability, they put put premiums on likability and agreeableness, they look for people who ""look like a winner"" when that only maybe slightly correlates... hard stuff. Companies whose managers have technical backgrounds have a better chance, but it's still quite a difficult challenge.",1246813100

Just off the top of my head in no particular order:<p><pre><code>  - understands the problem at hand before writing any code\n  - uses the right tool for the right job\n  - follows accepted standards and protocols without sacrificing creativity\n  - names variables & functions what they actually are for the next programmer\n  - anticipates what could go wrong before relying on a debugger or testing\n  - understands the underlying architecture and how to best utilitze it\n  - never writes the same code twice\n  - never writes in 150 lines that which could be written in 100 lines\n  - Poor code: uncommented.  Mediocre: commented.  Good: doesn't need comments.\n  - understands the entire code life cycle & writes it to last\n  - has pity on the poor soul who has to maintain it & leaves a clue or 2\n  - writes flexibly enough to be easily changed before the project is done\n</code></pre>\nI could go on and on, but you get the idea.

We were taught that economies with a large tertiary sector were ""better"". The tertiary economy mainly produces goods that are not fundamentally important to peoples lives. (Although obviously I think peoples lives are better than they were 50 years ago when it comes to longevity and other health issues, that's not what I'm getting at.)<p>With developed economies, there were two options that I can see. One was to lessen work hours and maintain consumption levels as technology improved, and the other option, which exists today, is to keep work hours the same (or increase them in many cases), and create more jobs in the services sector, which in turn requires more consumption to keep everything going.<p>I saw two options instead of two choices, because people were never given this choice.<p>Basically I think it boils down to this: You can work your ass off to buy stuff you mostly don't need and make someone else rich, or you can be an anti-consumerist, work less and...do whatever you want?",1246809979

From what I can see, he says this (skip bullet points if you have read it):<p>- Mathiness is truthiness, but in the way that putting down any mathematical symbols lends an air of intelligence and truth to an argument, for many people, especially those who don&#x27;t or can&#x27;t take the time to understand the argument logic.<p>- Then he explains how economics data are not as easy to construct with universal agreement as with, say, physics (temperature). Agreement on practical action is hard when contrary frames and interpretations appear valid.<p>- He then mentions how this might be a problem for defining capital and other constructs for Piketty, but without any useful argument beyond this assertion.<p>- He then contrasts Feynman&#x27;s integrity, trying to disprove his own work to make it better, to economist George Stigler&#x27;s rhetorical style of conviction, ignoring contrary arguments, and playing the polemicist.<p>- He then mentions Isaiah Berlin&#x27;s distinction between foxes who know little about something , and hedgehogs who know one big thing.<p>All these are interesting frames by which to compare and contrast various things. Yet his analysis, after bringing in all these ideas, is just to say that economics needs both careful analysis and effective rhetoric. Well, duh, but how does this tie into all the great setups he&#x27;s made so far?<p>And mathy people are good at neither rhetoric nor polemic? But surely, if you&#x27;re afraid of these people, they would be a mathy person who is using rhetoric to undermine the real philosophy and logic that should - pace Plato - be informing the argument.<p>It&#x27;s a post full of story and setup, but as yet, signifying nothing.",1445288388

However, here are a couple of thougts:<p>- I think there&#x27;s no doubt that the financial crisis and lack of jobs has led many to start their own companies (tech or not).<p>- Simply starting a business in Spain is not as hard as many portray it to be (it&#x27;s definitely <i>harder</i> than in the UK, for example), but taxes, lack of stock option plans (most companies here use what&#x27;s often referred to as phantom options) and, in general a not-entrepreneur-friendly mindset from many in society, can make it hard to grow and scale. That said, many relatively successful startups like CartoDB, Typeform or even peerTransfer and Alienvault follow the m.o. of building engineering teams here and move marketing and sales to the US.<p>- Spain&#x27;s current government has passed several pro-entrepreneur laws that, in essence, are just PR moves. Except, maybe, the launch of a new and simple entrepreneur visa. [0]<p>- This significant increase in VC financing has yet to reflect the more than €1.5 billion of public money that&#x27;s being poured into VCs and private equity firms to invest locally, trying to mimic Israel Yozma&#x27;s. [1]<p>- Barcelona has many interesting public and private initiatives going, and the city&#x27;s good image all around the world benefits it when it comes to recruiting foreign talent. [2]<p>- It&#x27;s not all fine and dandy, and there&#x27;re definitely some hard challenges for the country and startups to tackle over the next few years.<p>- Hopefully (what looks like) success stories such as Scytl, will spark the next generation of tech companies in Spain.

I&#x27;m talking about a replacement for <i>plaintext</i>; this doesn&#x27;t affect the handling of authenticated certificates in any way.<p>Since you still seem to not not understand this, let me be explicit: I&#x27;m saying we need protect against passive eavesdropping at the network level. I never said you should lie to the use* and claim their connection had any additional security. These fears about a &quot;false pretense of security&quot; are not relevant, as a move from plaintext to opportunistic encryption with self-signed certificates shouldn&#x27;t be visible to the user.<p>> I cannot trust that the party which I am communicating it is the party I intended to communicate with or that no one else has the key.<p>Obviously. I never claimed otherwise. This isn&#x27;t relevant, and if you want to protect against this threat model, you obviously need proper authentication (which I recommend whenever possible). Currently a lot communication on the internet has authentication risks AND allows <i>anybody</i> with a packet sniffer to log their data for next to no cost? You to believe it&#x27;s a bad idea to convert those plaintext situations into something that has the same authentication risks while only betraying the contents to a <i>single</i> eavesdropper, who <i>must</i> be a MitM.<p>There is no technical reason not to do this. As you obviously know because you referenced the certificate warning popup, self-signed certificates are trivially identifiable, so there is no reason to confuse them with normal certificates. Absolutely nothing needs to change in how this is presented to the user, so we aren&#x27;t creating any sort of false sense of security.<p>> Under those circumstances I will not transfer any information that I would not transfer over plain text period,<p>Good for you. What does that have to do with the fact that much of the internet is still filled with the plaintext of people who <i>don&#x27;t</i> understand this kind of technical topic? Why are you resisting shielding their communications from passive eavesdropping?<p>This attitude that security must protect against all threats (or at least the treats YOU care about) is a major problem. What do you think is going to happen? It is magical thinking to assume that everyone will suddenly start using full, proper crypto (they can do that right now).

(In which case, as long as you have <i>some</i> traffic, that should be enough to test your model and potentially start growing).<p>* Your growth model relies on SEO (in which case, you should spend time on that, not direct marketing)<p>* Your growth model relies on referrals.

Think of how many millions of sites exist (and are vying for your users&#x27; attention).

That is, every minute of compiler time costs a minute of developer time.<p>If your business starts to hit a wall on compile times you can buy a computer that can compile twice as fast. It&#x27;s much harder to buy a developer who can think twice as fast. And every year the computers get faster and the developers stay the same.<p>> Worse, the developer time you spend due to lack of a feature, you spend while writing some code that would benefit from the feature. The compiler time you pay every time you compile - year after year, for some projects.<p>No, the cost of being unable to abstract increases exponentially as your system grows. If using language X lets you cut 500 lines from a 1000-line Go project, then when you have a 2000-line Go project, in language X you&#x27;d be able to cut 500 lines from each half of it considering each half in isolation - and then you&#x27;d be able to cut some more because of things that were common between the two halves - so you&#x27;d end up with just 750 lines of language X.

Wonderful full-fledged type system, complete with a strongly typed model of HTTP (so that e.g. ContentType is well-typed, and takes a well-typed model of a MIME type, not just a String). Excellent concurrency support, very fun, all the JVM tooling/debug support. Deployment needs a tiny bit of fiddling - I recommend building with maven and using the maven shade plugin, then you get a standalone jar that you just need a JVM to run.<p>The unique selling point is that your routing is defined in a DSL that&#x27;s almost as nice as the config file most systems would use - but it&#x27;s ordinary Scala, well-typed and refactorable in the normal way because everything&#x27;s just code. And because the type system has higher-kinded types you can use typed wrappers to represent cross-cutting concerns, with the lovely for/yield sugar for composing them. E.g. you can have database-session-in-view but in a principled way: you have a wrapper type that represents an operation that needs to happen in a database transaction, and if you want to compose two or more such operations you use the for/yield sugar, and it&#x27;s all refactor-safe and you can tell which unit tests need a database (fake or real) because it&#x27;s right there in the type. And at the route level you either have a marshaller that handles your wrapper completely transparently, or your own directive that works exactly like the built in ones because again, it&#x27;s all just code. You can click through to the source of the directives and see how they&#x27;re implemented, not just magic annotations like with JAX-RS. If you want to get super mind blowing you can even use for/yield to compose together directives to make a custom directive.",1445286871

Keep in mind, though, that there are plenty of things about being an actuary that aren&#x27;t tested in the actuarial exams.  That doesn&#x27;t stop them from requiring that actuaries pass an exam involving calculus, linear algebra, and so forth.  And as a result, actuaries don&#x27;t have to go around re-studying integration by parts every time they want to change jobs.<p>I&#x27;ve been on a few interviews at different silicon valley companies, including Google and Amazon, as well as smaller ones, and the technical screening is remarkably similar.  I&#x27;ve noticed it is far more rigorous at some companies than others, but they all more or less test dynamic programming, recursion, trees, lists, hash tables, sorting, and permuting.  Even if we all agree that there is no way to have an exam that captures the wide, diverse nature of programming, it could still be useful to have an exam that covers that part that we test over and over and over.<p>There&#x27;s one other wrinkle that may not work here - many companies say they do this because they want to see how you tackle a difficult programming problem, how you communicate your solution, and so forth.  As a result, they might not be satisfied with an exceptional performance on a similar exam, even if they have high confidence in the board that created the questions and conducted the exam.<p>Now, all that said, I do consider this to be a really serious problem.  Why?  Because people who can study for and pass a difficult whiteboard exam on algorithms and combinatorics can pass the actuarial exams, the bar, the medical boards, and so forth.  I think that the software industry loses a lot of talent because people don&#x27;t like the idea of signing up for an industry where they will have to pass their entrance exams over and over, every time they change jobs, and the people who are capable of this have other options.  I think this is costing us a lot of talent, it may cause people to favor other fields, and it may cause people to give up and drop out.

If cross-platform UI toolkits have shown us anything, it&#x27;s that cross-platform UI toolkits are a bad idea.<p>You end up targeting the lowest common denominator, and a UI convention that works on Windows won&#x27;t work on OS X, and vice versa.<p>One big error made by these toolkits is to base themselves on generic pixel-oriented layouts, instead of more abstract declarative ones. For example, if you need a dialog box with a small form and &quot;OK&quot; and &quot;Cancel&quot; buttons, you&#x27;d lay each component out on a form, and the layout would be identical on each platform. But this is such a common thing to do that it would be better to just declare what fields should be visible and what actions should be available, and have different, platform-specific, opinionated adapters that can wire together a native UI from this metadata (together with some platfomr-specific, CSS-like hinting: &quot;on OS X this field needs to be at least 500px wide&quot;, etc.).<p>There&#x27;s a wide selection of common idioms (dialog boxes, file dialogs, &quot;wizards&quot;, preference panes, alerts, etc.) that fit into this scheme. The reason nobody did this is probably because developers overestimate how important it is to micromanage the UI, and don&#x27;t think a system like this could support all variations that apps need. In truth, most UIs are quite pedestrian, and could benefit from being driven by a high-level description.<p>This is where React (and React Native) actually would help, because the component interface is separate from the component implementation. You can have a fairly high-level mostly-declarative description of your app that pulls in platform-specific versions of certain UI widgets where it makes sense to have one, but otherwise relies on generic ones.",1445286388

The issue with the idea is usually doing it consistently and people properly configuring their editor (if the editor allows tab-indent+space-align at all), when the code is being hard-reformatted it&#x27;s not an issue.<p>> Even more confusingly to me, I really don&#x27;t understand why they seem to standardize on tabs expanding to 8 spaces rather than 4.<p>8 is the historical/default tabwidth on Unices (unconfigurable environments generally have a tabwidth of 8), using hard tabs but defaulting to anything else would be odd. And since it&#x27;s tabs, you can configure your environment to whichever tabwidth you prefer (like 3 or 6, I&#x27;ve not seen editors with support for tabwidths in half-spaces or pixels but in theory that&#x27;s also an option) (well technically the CSS tab-size property supports arbitrary <length> tabsizes but only Chrome >= 42 supports that, the rest only supports <integer> spaces, except for IE which has no support whatsoever).<p>A claimed benefit of 8 tabwidth is also that rightsward drift becomes a problem extremely early, the tabwidth thus acts as a check against over-nesting. Now that&#x27;s inconvenient in languages with significant &quot;natural drift&quot; like C# (where your code lives in a method in a class in a namespace so you&#x27;re already 3 indents deep before you&#x27;ve writing anything, class-in-files languages tend to have a tabwidth of 4 or even 2 probably for that reason), but IIRC Go only has a single &quot;natural ident&quot; the rest is all yours, so a tabwidth of 8 serves as a check against nesting code too much.",1445285999

At that point the FT index copies the inserted records down a level of the tree.

I found an apartment on Craigslist a few years ago and was surprised I was able to get it.  Often, Craigslist is full of broker spam disguised as a landlord listing an apartment or the apartment is simply taken up by someone right away.<p>The other option is to find a building managed by a larger company.  They almost always have &quot;0 fee rentals&quot;.  However, they often cost more too since they tend to have many facilities.<p>Honestly, many landlords like the broker system because brokers weed out bad renters by referencing their credit and arranging all the paper work and the landlord doesn&#x27;t really have to do anything.  The tenant pays all the fees and as this article pointed out, the landlord may in fact receive kickbacks.  At least in the NYC area, I don&#x27;t expect brokers to go away any time soon.  NYC is a beast upon itself in the housing world for renting and buying.<p>I would love to see brokers go away, however.  I have a suspicion they largely drive up rent prices as they can create an artificially small market and because they rely on inefficient methods, tenants are really only able to visit a small subset of places and brokers can get them to bid against each other.  This creates an artificially small market that is largely in the landlords favor.  They also will usually not show you places unless you are ready to move in by the end of the month which creates time pressure and panic in renters which, as you guessed, artificially drives up rent.",1445285441

Until the 1970s, complex electronic devices mostly stayed in labs, computer rooms, and military facilities, where they were cared for by technicians.  In the 1970s, consumer electronics beyond the TV set appeared.  Transistors and early ICs were reliable enough to make this possible.<p>But now a host of secondary problems had to be solved.  Soldering of PC boards wasn&#x27;t a reliable mass production process yet.  Plastic cased ICs weren&#x27;t perfectly airtight.  Connectors were not yet reliable.  IC line quality wasn&#x27;t consistent. IC wire bonding was done by hand. &quot;Purple plague&quot;, caused by contamination from the wire bonding process, corroded ICs internally. Phenolic PC boards were subject to hairline cracks.  ICs lacked electrostatic discharge protection on pins and static electricity could easily damage them. Power supples could not maintain voltage during power line sags and spikes.  RF shielding was poor; devices both emitted too much RF and were sensitive to RF in the area.  Many signals between boards and units were relative to ground, not differential, and ground loops were a problem.  On top of all this, it took a lot of components to do anything, so everything had a high part count and many interconnects, all points of failure.<p>Every one of those problems has been solved.  But that&#x27;s why 1970s electronic devices were troublesome, and didn&#x27;t age well.<p>Now, though, we have electromigration. Slowly, atoms creep across barriers just from statistical diffusion helped by electric fields.  This is a very slow process, but with IC features so small, not that many atoms have to move before something fails. It&#x27;s possible to make high-reliability electronics at a larger line size with current quality fab technology, and this is done for aerospace and some automotive applications.[1] Still, few consumer parts today have a design life longer than 20 years.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.freescale.com/products/ultra-reliable-microcontrollers-robust-safe-and-secure:ULTRA-RELIABLE-MCUS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freescale.com/products/ultra-reliable-microcontro...</a>",1445285267

Usually, the developer waits for the compiler in order to find out if the code compiles and executes properly.  That is, every minute of compiler time costs a minute of developer time.<p>Worse, the developer time you spend due to lack of a feature, you spend while writing some code that would benefit from the feature.  The compiler time you pay <i>every time you compile</i> - year after year, for some projects.",1445284894

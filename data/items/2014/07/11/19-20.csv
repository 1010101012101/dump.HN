The opacity of the actions that led to what virtues is also quite difficult. For instance, in my playthrough I didn&#x27;t work out that killing a fleeing <i>animal</i> is uncompassionate until I cheated by borrowing somebody else&#x27;s save that had all eight virtues and losing my compassion then. (In real life, &quot;putting a badly injured animal out of its misery&quot; is at least debateably compassionate itself.... and we&#x27;re talking about &quot;snakes&quot; that just took a good run at <i>killing</i> an armed warrior, I admit I can&#x27;t easily work this into the 8 virtues per se but surely I shouldn&#x27;t just let such things roam the countryside?)<p>Speaking as someone in a very similar situation... I bet it took you a <i>long time</i>, though. Starting the game not even knowing to say &quot;name&quot; and &quot;job&quot; to absolutely everybody is a heck of a disadvantage to start. There must have been some way to be reminded in game, somewhere, because I worked it out too eventually, but we&#x27;re talking hours of loss there.<p>If you can get past all that, and write everything down, and understand the flow of the game, it becomes a simple game in concept, as befits its era. (Eight times, you must: Attain the virtue, acquire the mantra, locate the shrine, acquire the stone. There&#x27;s some other quests you must do, a couple of optional ones, but not that many.) Were it not for the interminable combat and the general resource scarcity, it would not be a hard game today, especially if we spot you a couple of swings at a FAQ to pick up a trail you lost or the answer to one or two of the hardest puzzles (the answer to the very last question, again as answered in the article, being a very difficult one).<p>In a way, the game must be hailed as being perhaps the most successful games of the time at hiding just how small it really is.",1405106901

Atkinson and T. Piketty eds., Oxford University Press, 2007)"".<p>It is an excel file that contains a metric ton of tables, charts, and figures. If you have a few moments and want a deeper understanding of the issue, that excel file is the best place to go.<p>(Edit: I just wanted to note one thing. My favorite graph from the excel file is figure 1B, where you can see that we are basically returning to where we were prior to World War II. It makes you wonder what was so different about the post-war period that resulted in this shift. Personally, I wonder if the sudden subsidization of education for returning veterans had anything to do with it, but I have no data on this right now, so...)<p>As far as my own thoughts on the issue go, I agree with pg. For a boring, academic take on it, there is a wonderfully dry 1980s paper by Rosen outlining the superstar theory:<p><a href=""http://www.ppge.ufrgs.br/giacomo/arquivos/ecop72/rosen-1981.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ppge.ufrgs.br/giacomo/arquivos/ecop72/rosen-1981....</a><p>Basically, thanks to technology and globalization the rewards to individuals that have the highest levels of abilities have been magnified. Their ""reach"" has increased relative to those below them, and their rewards have increased in line with this.<p>While interest in this seems to be popping up all over the place due to the current economic catastrophe in progress, the idea that communications infrastructure improvements lead to income inequality is an old one.<p>Here is Alfred Marshall (founder of neoclassical economics) in 1890 (revision from 1920):<p><a href=""http://www.econlib.org/library/Marshall/marP54.html#VI.XII.42"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econlib.org/library/Marshall/marP54.html#VI.XII.4...</a><p>As for myself, I have no idea about whether this is a good thing or a bad thing (or whether anything could/should be done about the growing inequality). However, it is happening now, on a grand scale, so I think that it is important for everyone to have some context on the issue.",1315609196

2980164,comment,2979570,2980117,1,0,grayrest,,,"The optional parens is something I personally go back and forth on. I went through a phase where I always left them off but have been moving back towards using them most of the time. The holdout is for calling things that take functional arguments. Here's how I'd write the nodejs.org home page example:<p><pre><code>    {createServer} = require 'http'\n\n    host = '127.0.0.1'\n    port = 1337\n\n    server = createServer (req, res) ->\n        res.writeHead(200, 'Content-Type': 'text/plain')\n        res.end('Hello World\n')\n    server.listen(host, port)\n\n    console.log ""Server running at http://#{host}:#{port}/""\n</code></pre>\nNotice `require` looks sort of like a language statement. The `console.log` thing is my own quirk. However, the call to `createServer` would require a hanging paren if parens weren't optional. It wouldn't look bad here (and, in fact the official example uses it to chain the listen call) but is less attractive if you're using longer functions. Calls like `memoize` and `operation` (think unit of work pattern) tend to work well with this.",1315608997

Now they're back pedaling in hopes of finding the sweet spot. It's costing them customers and making them look 2nd rate. I think most devs would have preferred if Google started with realistic pricing and worked their way down.<p>It's simple human psychology, if you set an expectation and surpass it, people are happy, if you fall short, people are unhappy. If pricing started in line with Amazon, Azure, Rackspace, Linode etc. people would say, ""Ok, that's fair."" and if Google made it cheaper, people would be ecstatic. Instead, they fell short and made people mad. Now they have to reset the expectations and hope to not screw up again.<p>Take this as a lesson, under promise and over deliver. Always.",1315608811

Pollution is a negative externality because the byproduct of my voluntary transaction to buy gas and burn it in my car is that you have to breathe the exhaust.  You are an external third party that is hurt without compensation. What external third party is being harmed when one person produces a lot and gets rich and another person doesn't?<p>One economic argument against inequality is that it results in people spending a lot of resources on guard labor.  If I live in neighborhood with lots of inequality I have to spend lots of resources keeping the poor people from stealing my things.  Therefore, reducing inequality via income distribution can create a public good in the form of less crime (and less resources wasted on protecting property).

I used Python as my primary language from 2001-2007 before switching to Javascript/Coffeescript full time so I'll provide a bit of commentary.<p>> Arrays could use a beard or the varied language syntax is going to cause ingrown pains<p>The whitespace magic only causes me a problem in a few situations.<p>Watch indent on wrapped if statement:<p><pre><code>    if foo is true or bar is false or\n        baz is null\n        doSomething() #Error\n\n    if foo is true or bar is false or\n       baz is null\n        doSomething() #ok\n</code></pre>\nExplicitly returning objects is awkward:<p><pre><code>    foo: ->\n        if not ok then return\n        #lots of code here\n        return\n              x: 1 #ha ha\n              y: 2\n\n    foo: ->\n        if not ok then return\n        #lots of code here\n        return {\n              x: 1  #ok but ugly\n              y: 2}\n</code></pre>\nI always want to use implicit call parens with property chaining but that doesn't work:<p><pre><code>    $('.doAllTheThings').filter 'span'\n                        .data 'foo', true\n                        .wrap '<div/>'\n    #produces filter('span'.data('foo' ...\n\n\n    $('.doAllTheThings').filter('span')\n                        .data('foo', true)\n                        .wrap('<div/>')\n</code></pre>\nThe result of assigning a comprehension threw me off for a while because I was thinking Python list comprehension instead of postfix loop:<p><pre><code>    foo = x + 1 for x in array\n\n    foo = (x + 1 for x in array) #what I expected\n    \n    (foo = x + 1) for x in array #what happens\n    for x in array  #same thing written the other way\n       foo = x + 1\n    </code></pre>\nFinally, the whitespace magic working well tends to depend on object/functional arguments coming last in the call list with the functional arg coming after the object.<p>These annoyances are relatively rare and are the sort of thing you just get used to if you use the language heavily. The upside is that for an appropriately designed API (the options object argument last convention in JS makes this fairly common), the object literal magic gives a feel like python kwargs:<p><pre><code>  animatedShow node, duration: 200, onComplete: -> fire 'doThing'\n</code></pre>\nYou can also do DSLish things fairly easily. I'm a fairly heavy YUI user. Compare:<p><pre><code>    YUI.add('myCoolModule', function(Y, name) {\n        Y.CoolModel = Y.Base.create('coolModel', Y.Model, [], {\n            aMethod: function(){return this.get('foo') === 1}\n        },{\n            ATTRS: {\n                foo: {value: 1},\n                bar: {value: 2, readOnly: true}\n            }\n        })\n    }, '1.0.0', { requires: ['app', 'model'] });\n</code></pre>\nto:<p><pre><code>    YUI.module 'myCoolModule',\n      version: '1.0.0'\n      requires: ['app', 'model']\n      (Y) ->\n        Y.CoolModel = CoolModel\n        class CoolModel extends Y.Model\n            @ATTRS:\n                foo:\n                    value: 1\n                bar:\n                    value: 2\n                    readOnly: true\n\n            aMethod: -> @get('foo') is 1\n</code></pre>\nIt requires a one word patch on Coffeescript (superclass name in generated output) and the addition of a tiny YUI.module to YUI.add shim but I think the result is a lot cleaner.<p>> It's also bizarre from a Python background<p>Python's auto-concatenation of runs of string literals is convenient but I don't know of another language that does the same thing.<p>>   if foo.bar? then console.log foo.bar<p>The ? is an explicit existence check, while doing `if(foo.bar)` will fail if bar is an empty string or zero. I tend to write existence checks using the postfix form:<p><pre><code>    console.log foo.bar if foo.bar\n</code></pre>\nThis is a personal style that indicates that the normal control flow is to log but there's a simple guard on the operation. I'd use the if...then form if I expected the test to fail a significant fraction of the time (i.e. it's a branch instead of a guard). My other quirk is that I use &&/|| only for short circuiting but and/or only for boolean logic.",1315607692

What's more, rises in the unemployment rate due to recessions were quickly and successfully fought using fiscal policy.

Economic troubles in the 1970s helped convince people that something needed to change and made it easier for attitudes towards economic policy to be changed, i.e. the shock doctrine. Thatcher in the UK was probably the most memorable driver of this change with her very open fight against unions.<p>It seems to me that a nice test of which of the two explanations fits the bill better is to compare the development to countries in which those measures of inequality, unemployment, and decoupling of real wage from productivity increases did not change at the same time as in the US.<p>Was it because the large corporation developed differently, or was it because those political shifts happened at a different time?",1315607647

It's true. I'm a leftist and I must admit that. That's not to say that the other 90% aren't working hard and don't deserve to share in the gains-- they obviously do-- but those gains are coming from a small percentage of people. Many, many people work hard and deserve to have good lives for their contributions, but only a small percentage (about 10%) have the vision and creativity to push <i>increases</i> in productivity; most are adders, few are multipliers. (Many politicians are dividers, but that's another story.)<p>The gains since 1978 have also gone to about 10% of the population. Maybe less than 10%. Income gains are often offset by increased prices in the Unholy Trinity (housing, healthcare, education costs). Quality-of-life is also going down in most of the country, and where it is increasing, housing prices are absurd even now. Even people whose incomes appear to be growing may be back-sliding. 10% is generous, but let's go with that.<p>These 10%'s <i>are not the same people</i>. (Sorry Randists). There's an intersection, but it's only about 2-3%, or 20-30% of each. The first set are the creators of wealth; the second set are capturing it. Startup entrepreneurs are in the first set (and if lucky, can enter the second). Well-connected rich kids who get staffed in private equity firms at 24 and get to draw fees from economic activity regardless of success or failure (because they'll get promoted anyway) are in the second set.<p>Speaking as a member of first set, and merely on the outer fringe of the second, I'll just say this: no, the economic inequality in the U.S. is <i>not</i> desirable. Hard-line egalitarianism is ridiculous and impractical, but inequality has gone too far. We know this. The only reason the absurdity is tolerated is that 10-30% of the American population has insane social and religious views that impel them toward degenerate politics.<p>Anyone who has traveled within Latin American societies <i>at all</i> can see where we're heading, and it's not pretty: massive economic inequality, desperate rural poverty, and intractably corrupt, plutocratic governments.<p>I'll admit that what bothers me most about American equality is <i>what</i> drives the inequality. If it were reflective of differences in intelligence, the correlation (slight, but positive) between intelligence and empathy would be enough to impel this smart-and-rich elite to give back to the rest. At least, I hope that is the case. But that's not what we have. Increasingly, the inequality comes from inherited social connections (social capital, mostly implicitly generational) and, as it increases, the decision-making elite becomes more insular. That's what most elites become (generational social networks, not meritocracies) and that is how societies rot.",1315607019

There's the ""Star Trek"" kind that does social commentary, and tries to get the audience to think about something directly by sidestepping the trappings of modern society.  Then, there's the ""Star Wars"" kind that is basically a far-reaching exercise in world building that only has a plot so that you're not reading a technical description.<p><i>Stranger in a Strange Land</i> is perhaps the purest example of the former, because it's very meta:  the thing Heinlein wanted you to think about is the very idea of preconceived notions and full understanding.  He spends the first half of the book explaining that you can understand something intellectually without understanding it emotionally, and the last half systematically questioning more and more ingrained ideas (at least at the time) so that you think about them intellectually.<p>Most of the list is the other type.  I'll pick on <i>Dune</i>, since it happens to be number one on the list.  Herbert introduces you to a universe that's really completely unlike any other conceived:  people fly around in spaceships and have enormous mental powers, but there are no computers (they are illegal), people still fight with bladed weapons (all others are rendered either useless or too dangerous), and universal government has become feudal in nature (for various reasons).  People send <i>messengers</i>.  A bioengineering project and a social engineering project (gray projects by the same faction, no less) collide, and turn the universe upside down.<p>As far as hard SF goes, I'd originally clustered that with the world-building type, basically because every good example I've read happens to be in that category.

It doesn't scale unless you ensure the managers layers below you encourage their employees to take time off and are as flexible as you.<p>I'd also strongly recommend looking over that shared vacation calendar and identify anyone who may not be taking a reasonable amount of time off. Some people are just love their jobs ... I'm one of them, and it's not as big a deal (though, I believe nearly everyone benefits from some time off, even when forced). But make a point to ensure they don't think the ""we don't track vacation time"" equates to ""we don't take vacation time"".<p>I'd also steer clear of the ""laptops to the beach"" comments. I don't take frequent vacations, but when I do, I <i>need</i> to go places where I can barely get a phone call and have no internet (I fight with myself on this topic every time, but when I go on a cruise or camp in a remote part of the state that I live in, I always return more refreshed than when I go somewhere that I can keep up with e-mail).  I don't know the culture of your company, but at my company ""laptops on the beach"" would be code for ""obligation to carry your laptop with you at all times"".<p>Just my 2p, you sound like a decent leader and I appreciate the transparency.",1315606249

I'd love to see actual evidence of this, though.<p>My disagreement with PG would come with whether that's the primary driver of inequality.

Consider Oprah Winfrey. She s probably only marginally better than the next best candidate for talk show queen. Yet she has amassed 100s of millions while the next bes candidate for her job has no such job at alll. So we have two people, one tha is maybe 5% better at being a talk show queen, her income is 100 million, and another, 5% worse, and her income is some middle class wage like 50,000. Because of consolidation, the society only needs one Oprah Winfrey. We are paying 100 million to the role, not the woman. Thats the key point. She herself is worth 50,000 plus 5%, and the role of talk show queen, which could have been filled almost as well by many, many other people, is worth all the rest of the money. That role belongs to society, not to Oprahe Winfrey.<p>You see the same thing with CEOs, bankers, and others where consoliated and mass production allows only a few highly productive roles. The wealth associated with those roles, which is to say the consolidate dower, belongs to society not to the individual lucky enough to get to fill the role. This is why tax rates of 91% on the few that occupy the most consolidate roles was thoroughly appropriate and part of an economic approach that led to Americas greatest period of growth and general prosperity. High taxes on those who wield societies greatest powers on behalf of society are normative. The power, the influence they wield belongs to the society that allows and enables it, not to the individual who fills the role.<p>""""""<p>[ comment by 'Sharn cedar' on 'DEAR RICH FOLKS: Get Ready For A (Tax) Revolution In Which Your Money Will Be Taken Away',\n<a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/tax-increases-are-coming-2011-7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/tax-increases-are-coming-2011...</a> - sic, a few typos uncorrected ]",1315605787

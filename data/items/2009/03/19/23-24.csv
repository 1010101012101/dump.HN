524213,comment,523280,524037,0,0,mdasen,,,"Nope.  extra() doesn't allow one to do that.  extra() can be used to populate an attribute.  So, say I wanted to do a comment count I could say<p><pre><code>  Article.objects.all().extra(select={'comment_count': 'SELECT count(*) FROM blog_comment WHERE blog_comment.article_id = blog_article.id'})\n</code></pre>\nBut I can't populate a list of comments objects onto it.<p>I've talked to Malcom about it (who wrote the QuerySet Refactor branch - or at least a substantial portion) and it's a known deficiency.  Basically, the issue is two-fold.  First, no one has stepped up to write the code that would make select_related() work in that fashion.  Second, people want the implementation to disallow certain bad situations.<p>The first part is self-explanatory: select_related() should be enhanced to support that, but someone needs to write the code.  The second part isn't as much, but it's more interesting.<p>Let's say you execute this query:<p><pre><code>  SELECT * FROM articles LEFT OUTER JOIN comments ON comments.article_id = articles.id\n</code></pre>\nHow many rows will you get from that?  You'll get somewhere in the vicinity of the number of comments (adding a row for any article without comments).  Suffice it to say, the results set grows linearly in proportion to the number of articles and comments.<p>Now let's say we have this:<p><pre><code>  SELECT * FROM articles LEFT OUTER JOIN comments ON comments.article_id = articles.id LEFT OUTER JOIN votes ON votes.article_id = articles.id\n</code></pre>\nSo, we have our article with comments, but also votes now.  So, let's say we want to get just one article that has 100 comments and 200 votes.  How many lines will that return?  In the original SQL query, we would have seen 100 lines (one for each comment) which would have been manageable.  Here, we get 100 * 200 lines back.  That's 20,000 rows to parse to build a single Article object!<p>So, the Django folk aren't into letting you just hang yourself out to dry like that.  There have been proposals to limit it in ways that wouldn't let you do that, but it's really just something genuinely missing and there isn't a way to do it other than running looped queries or doing something ugly.<p>extra() doesn't do the same thing as select_related().  I'm not saying that doing ORM over multi-valued relationships is easy or that you can't execute queries that are really bad doing them, but it still means that there isn't support for a pretty basic function.",1237506303

524158,comment,523687,523687,0,0,ewjordan,,,"With all the talk of advertising ""crashing"" (I've heard a lot of these claims lately), I'd really like to see some numbers to back it all up and prove the point.<p>Are advertising revenues down significantly more than, say, the Dow average?  Because otherwise I would have a real hard time agreeing with the assessment that another advertising bubble is popping...<p>The problem with a switch to paid content is, of course, that it makes very little sense to assume that the customers that you want to pay you or what they're used to getting for free are any better off financially than you are, or any more willing to pay for the content than advertisers are willing to pay for eyeballs.<p>However ""unproven"" the advertising business model on the web may be, the user-pays-for-content model has even fewer success stories - I'm getting a little tired of people claiming that it's the clear way of the future when just about nobody has made it work yet.",1237504213

Just check some common words at mailinator. A lot of those have more spam than can come from one person using it.

524153,comment,523946,524130,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"<i>there is a real measurable performance increase for smoking while programming.</i><p>I used to smoke and found this also to be true. HOWEVER, when actually working with a team at an office I realized it was actually decreasing performance because I had to constantly dodge out back for a smoke break, completely disrupting my flow. Even most places where I've lived the past 5 years weren't really smoke friendly, so smoking just became a huge distraction rather than a concentration aid.<p>In addition to the obvious health and financial reasons, this was a big reason that I quit. Thus, even though I'm all for less government, I fully support smoking bans.<p>I wonder if the same technique would work for harder drugs. I.e. legalize cocaine and heroin, but make it so that the only place people can legally do them is in a cold alleyway 30 yards behind the pub, next to a garbage dumpster. This way you'd get rid of the drug-dealing related crime but make it seem like a pretty lame habit to pick up.",1237504007

So you could get people to go to your site, and they could automatically access sites. The problem with bugmenot is that people change the password on the throwaway accounts, so it is sometimes hard to find valid accounts. This way you could control the password and make sure it wasn't changed. That will get you page views, and let you put up advertising.<p>I like the site though, it's always nice to have another throw away email account.

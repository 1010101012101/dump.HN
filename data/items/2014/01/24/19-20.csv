This thread about Uber. So yeah, every comment&#x27;s gonna be about Uber. And as a long-term commenter and bystander with no skin in the game, I don&#x27;t have to have a game. But, as you&#x27;ve pointed out, you&#x27;re a tech reporter, so you presumably are angling for something, probably some story hook. In any case, I&#x27;m defending Uber because I think a lot of things are being said that are not fair or accurate. You&#x27;ll note that I have not tried to defend the actual practice of harvesting phone numbers from Gett. I think that&#x27;s pretty bad, as well as whatever the Boston office is doing with their cute names. But people in this thread are rather intent on talking about other things, such as the new years eve accident (wherein Uber behaved acceptably as far as I can tell).<p>As for company culture, the cute names were from the Boston office. pain_perdu did not say these names are used across the entire company. It&#x27;s certainly possible, but from that one anecdote all I can say is that some people (heck, maybe even just the one person that pain_perdu knows) uses these names. There&#x27;s nothing to indicate there&#x27;s a company-wide culture of this sort of thing.<p>Although, to be honest, given what I&#x27;ve read about the CEO of Uber, I wouldn&#x27;t be terribly surprised if the names are used elsewhere.

7117423,comment,7116282,7116661,5,0,kposehn,,,"Four issues with the article:<p>#1: I understand the desire to do comparison in the market and look at Stripe&#x27;s multiple vs. others, but PayPal and Stripe are not equal in forward looking growth. To try and apply Stripe&#x27;s valuation multiple to PayPal&#x27;s earnings assumes that PayPal is in the same sort of growth stage, which it clearly isn&#x27;t. And most likely, Braintree was not either when they sold. Why sell if you&#x27;re eating everyone&#x27;s lunch?<p>#2: While numbers from six months ago may have been circulated and Pando apparently has those numbers, a lot can change in that timeframe. Large deals can be closed, growth can accelerate or very important technology can mature that has the potential to upset the status quo in Stripe&#x27;s favor. General analysis of the market and knowing the habits of several of Stripe&#x27;s investors makes me think that a key factor that is not public is in play. I expect a deal that gives them far better profit margin.<p>#3: &quot;Stripe is a transaction-based business with a clear model — and one not growing particularly rapidly if it took two years to get to just $1.5 billion in annual payments volume our sources report as of six months ago.&quot; This is a bad assumption to make. As a rule, I never assume a company has a transparent business model as there are many aspects of technology and deal structure outsiders are not privy to. Who is to say Stripe doesn&#x27;t have a new payments product on the way? Would it be so crazy for them to start snapping up downstream fulfillment companies with an $80mm war chest to maximize profit margin? Maybe so as they of course don&#x27;t want to compete with customers, but who knows?<p>#4: Another issue with the assumption about payment volume is a linear growth curve. If you say &quot;Braintree did $12bn in payment volume when it sold in late 2013, that means $2bn in volume growth per year, more than stripe with $500mm per year over 3 years of life&quot;. However, looking at articles that state Braintree&#x27;s payment volume shows they were apparently doing only $3bn annually in 2011 at their $34mm Series-C (<a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/29/accel-puts-34-million-in-online-payments-platform-braintree/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/29/accel-puts-34-million-in-on...</a>). If Stripe is assumed to be making a rapid growth stride to make this raise, then they likely have a similar (or stronger) growth curve than Braintree did at that point (<a href=""https://twitter.com/paulg/status/403183731449413632/photo/1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/paulg/status/403183731449413632/photo/1</a>)<p>The problem I have with the article is that you&#x27;re making a series of assumptions and treating them as fact, or at least as highly likely. This is difficult to make stick with a company that is deliberately opaque, as is their right to be.<p>* I am of course analyzing this from a very-outside perspective and my assumptions should be taken with a grain of salt.

I sacrifice other things (watching TV, reading the newspaper, playing video games) so that I can do creative work.</i><p>In late August of last year I had come to the conclusion that I needed to start and finish a small project to get a feel for what it takes to see things through and gain perspective on what it takes to bring an idea to reality. I&#x27;ve been building things for as long as I&#x27;ve been able but in software it&#x27;s never, &quot;finished,&quot; and I always have my nose to the grindstone. So I picked a hobby I&#x27;m passionate about, scoped out a project I felt could be reasonably completed in my spare time and at the advice of a friend I signed up to be a vendor at a local comic/arts/games festival... <i>and I only had an idea!</i><p>Needless to say it put a lot of things into focus. I did sacrifice time with my wife in the weeks leading up to the event. I spent every spare moment I had when I wasn&#x27;t at work or taking care of my family on it (with the occasional night off of course). I realized pretty early on that I wasn&#x27;t able to do everything: I farmed out illustration and typesetting work to other freelancers. I never did find an editor in time which hurt the project a little I think. But every step of the way up until that milestone I was thinking about what I needed to do next in order to get there.<p>And when I was finally there? I printed twenty books. Sold six. And couldn&#x27;t have been happier with the outcome. I have a website up, the beginnings of a fun little project and this year my goal is to work on marketing and promotion: something I have never done before.<p>You just have to play with the hand you&#x27;ve been dealt.",1390592546

All of this with no increased susceptability to 50% attacks. This essentially solves the problem that caused Satoshi to set the 10 minute target for the block creation rate. We also analyze the number of transactions per second Bitcoin can handle with and without our modification.

It&#x27;s based on irrational thinking derived from a flawed ideology.<p>Since LLVM is not copylefted, EVERYONE is able to benefit from it, and that is good... FOR EVERYONE! For example, NVIDIA based their CUDA compiler on LLVM because it was not copylefted. Thanks to LLVM not being copylefted, NVIDIA was able to reduce their R&D time, provide customers with great technology, and consequently sell more products. The money that proprietary companies make from being able to incorporate non-copylefted software into their products has a ripple effect. Companies like NVIDIA can provide more jobs, LLVM developers become more highly sought-after, customers benefit from more rapid advances in the technology, and the entire LLVM-based community benefits from work that filters back down from companies like NVIDIA into the mainline LLVM repo.<p>Stallman&#x27;s argument that projects like LLVM help proprietary companies take away users&#x27; rights is simply not true. There would be little benefit for a company like NVIDIA to take from the LLVM community, and be unwilling to give anything back. For one, it would be so much harder for them to hire good people out of that community, which they will desperately need in order to drive their products forward. But look at what has actually happened: NVIDIA are releasing the code to their LLVM-based compiler! Why? Because it doesn&#x27;t really benefit NVIDIA to enforce a proprietary lock-in on their customers.<p>As for his argument against the Apple App Store, how is it really of benefit to anyone if binaries are &quot;free&quot; the way he thinks they should be? Does anyone really want or need the ability to install a &quot;free&quot; binary onto their iPhone/iPad? Why is wrong for companies to want to protect their proprietary platforms and technology (and also their users) from potentially malicious/illegal code, or code that might brick the device? Oh, that&#x27;s right! Because Richard Stallman thinks that companies should not be allowed to guard any of their interests when it comes to software. This is an obnoxious opinion, and detrimental to real user freedom.<p>I do not think the world will suffer AT ALL if clang/LLVM has doomed GCC to irrelevance. I was actually glad to read Stallman&#x27;s email because it signifies that clang/LLVM really are eroding GCC&#x27;s relevance, to the point where even Stallman is feeling it. Soon, Stallman and his FSF cronies will be relegated to the footnotes of computing history where they belong.",1390592169

The problem is that there&#x27;s nothing inherently different about Dogecoin that ensures a faster growth rate than Bitcoin. Bitcoin also has a subreddit, and I would argue a more mature community, even though it may not be the new hotness.<p>What is different about Dogecoin, it&#x27;s faster block confirmation, it&#x27;s faster difficulty retargeting, and it&#x27;s larger reward payout, actually make it inherently less secure than Bitcoin (Litecoin shares these traits, to a lesser degree). The reason it&#x27;s seeing faster growth compared to Bitcoin at the moment is that mining is still somewhat reasonable with regular hardware, but this will change fairly soon and slow it&#x27;s growth rate as miners jump on the next currency that offers faster payouts.<p>So why not build your social network for tipping around Bitcoin? Personally I&#x27;d prefer a Bitcoin tip of 0.002 rather than 1000 Dogecoin.",1390590907

The confirmation period checks if there is any fraud in the transaction. Bitpay for example takes on the risk of Bitcoin&#x27;s double spend fraud (sending the same bitcoin to two merchants simultaneously). If there are some way to reduce the transaction confirmation time to seconds, then alternative crypocurrency could be widely adopted in brick and motor retail.",1390590790

I don&#x27;t see any compelling evidence that breakage is more frequent for MELPA users than for those who only use Marmalade.<p>It&#x27;s correct that we don&#x27;t want our current packages to build off non-master tags or branches, and that&#x27;s because we&#x27;ve a bigger picture in mind. It&#x27;s a concrete goal of MELPA is to provide two parallel archives of packages: the existing one, filled with &quot;bleeding edge&quot; packages, and a new archive containing &quot;stable&quot; packages which have been built from the same upstream sources, but using existing version tags found there. We&#x27;re making progress with this goal: see <a href=""https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa/pull/1407"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa/pull/1407</a>, for example.<p>If we can pull this off, this will yield the best of both worlds: users will get known-good versions of packages, and at the same time they will be confident that the stable packages came from the upstream developer&#x27;s source tree (which isn&#x27;t at all assured with Marmalade). It will also make releasing a new stable package as easy as tagging a source repository.<p>Recent versions of `package.el` allow packages to be pinned to specific package archives, which lets those concerned about bleeding-edge breakage pick and choose between &quot;stable&quot; and &quot;unstable&quot; packages on a case-by-case basis.",1390590748

7116894,comment,7115949,7116325,5,0,blisterpeanuts,,,"East St. Louis is really a separate topic from St. Louis; the name is just coincidental.  That said, when I lived in St. Louis, East St. Louis was the destination of choice for carjacker-rapists who would take their victims across the bridge and dump them in some industrial parking lot.<p>St. Louis is currently listed as 3rd highest violent crime rate in the country (Detroit is #1, but in years past St. Louis edged out Detroit for murder rate).  I&#x27;m not saying don&#x27;t move there, but just be aware that north St. Louis is a pretty bad area and the economy doesn&#x27;t seem to have improved much, despite the massive investments into the central urban attractions like the Arch, Union Station, and the things listed in the OP.<p>Perhaps the main problem with St. Louis is the division between the actual city of St. Louis and the various suburban towns that surround it.  In 1970, the city boasted a population of nearly one million, and just 3-4 years later it was down to about half that.  City residents blame the population implosion on school busing which led to white flight.  The burbs like Clayton, Webster Groves, etc., in St. Louis County (&quot;the County&quot; as people call it) had their own tax base and when affluent people flocked there, the city lost a substantial portion of its tax revenue.<p>Overall, I really liked St. Louis but the crime rates are pretty bad.  The weather in the summer is also bad -- very hot and humid.  You will need AC, and it doesn&#x27;t come by default with every dwelling.  If it were me, I&#x27;d be looking at Phoenix or Tucson, because of their proximity to southern California and of course the weather, but then I spent some time in Arizona and fell in love with the place.  Cost of living is probably comparable if not cheaper than St. Louis as well.  Can&#x27;t speak for the start-up community in Phoenix, however; there&#x27;s not much of one that I heard of, as of 2010 or so.",1390590719

In all countries the act of counterfeiting is unfair, leads to inflation and is almost always illegal.<p>The fact that the mining is tapering off for bitcoin isn&#x27;t a problem. It&#x27;s actually a feature that is designed to mitigate uncontrolled inflation.<p>The TRUE problem with bitcoin is that the nature of the coins themselves are changed by the way people perceive the coins. If people treat the coins as currency then thats what it becomes, but if people treat it as a speculative investment asset similar to a stock share then that&#x27;s what bitcoin will become as well.<p>Right now nobody buys bitcoins to use as a currency. I can assure you 99% of bitcoin transactions occur because people are gambling on the fact that the price will go up and not because you want to use the coins as you use a dollar bill.

All the pour-over coffee in the world doesn&#x27;t make you happy when you can&#x27;t get a date, and those artisan cocktails are far less cute when you&#x27;re jockeying for position at the bar in a crowded room full of guys.

One issue is the licensing of GCC, the other issue is the architecture of GCC (how modular it is).<p>No one is arguing that GCC should change licenses.  But he seems to think that making GCC more modular would somehow make it less free:<p>> If GCC were to change from a free compiler into a platform for nonfree compilers, it would no longer serve the goal of freedom very well.<p>There are two embedded assumptions here.  First, that making GCC more modular would result in people creating non-free compilers with it (presumably by connecting a non-free component with GCC using an IR rather than linking directly, to get around the GPL).  And second, that such use would become more prevalent than just using GCC itself (which is what would &quot;change&quot; GCC from a free compiler into a platform for nonfree compilers).<p>I imagine a few people would use GCC components that way, if it became more modular.  But would that use be a significant one?  That&#x27;s unknown.  And would that use &quot;no longer serve the goal of freedom&quot;?  If a large number of nonfree tools appear that generate and consume a GCC IR, that could boost GCC as well.<p>The GPL seems to be able to defend freedom just fine for all the other gnu software, even the modularly-architected projects.

Rides are $2.50, less when purchased in bulk.<p>- A restricted supply of taxis has meant supply concentrates in the southern portion of Manhattan where fares are frequent and relatively short (maximizing profitability as there is a $3.50 meter drop immediately when taking a new passenger). Taxi drivers strongly avoid areas where fares are less frequent, and rides are longer - and surprise, that&#x27;s where poor people are.<p>These have nothing to do with higher fees - enforced supply has resulted in lack of taxi availability to the poor, but not because of high fees.

There is also no mark-up through as many distribution channels. There&#x27;s no physical shelf space necessary, there&#x27;s not the same sort of publisher relationships needed.  A team (of any size) can create a game and publish it directly.<p>So because of changes in distribution and an increased market, the price should go down due to reduced expenses.  But the other side is that many of these changes also reduce the barrier to entry of new developers.  This means that there&#x27;s more competition which means that the price will go down due to reduced margins from competition.<p>It&#x27;s not so much that it&#x27;s $1-4 for a dumb game and $16 for a quality game.  It&#x27;s that people sell quality games for less than 5 dollars and still make money.  It&#x27;s also the perception that &quot;this game was already made&quot;.  Chances are the people who are buying it have already played it because these rereleases are generally for fans of the game. So you&#x27;re paying again for a game that&#x27;s 20 years old.  Does it make sense to pay more than a new game?<p>That said I&#x27;m in total agreement that the biggest thing about it is form factor.

Touch screen gamepads are not intuitive, and occlude the screen.  Phones are always on you which is very handy for games that you want to pick up or put down, but not so important for marathon sessions.  Phones have batteries which need to be considered, so again, you want to avoid the marathon gaming sessions.<p>The reason we have so many casual games on the phone is because the phone is the ideal target for casual games.  Games that you can pick up and put down.  Go and play a level of candy crush saga on the toilet.  Go and shoot some angry birds waiting for the train.  I&#x27;ve tried to play some RPGs this way and you might get through a minor segment of a story line or some plot exposition on the can before your legs start to get numb.<p>You often find $60 PC games for sale.  We haven&#x27;t moved to a point where games are all $1-4.  We just have moved to a point where casual games are $1-4, and bigger games demand a different delivery method than a little phone screen and substandard (compared with the alternatives of a console or PC) hardware.  If you&#x27;re going to pay $60 for a game, you&#x27;re probably planning on putting some real time aside for it, which means sitting at your desk or on the couch.  When you get an app for the phone instead, you do it because you might get some use out of it when you can&#x27;t spend the time to sit at a desk or on the couch.",1390590310

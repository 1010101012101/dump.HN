Of course they don't realize that if you could quickly find out that you and someone else having something in common, your friendship might blossom and instead of not starting.<p>Also, this notion that our lives depend on whether we think demo technology is cool or not is pretty crazy.",1236941978

Here is a link to something I put online last year:<p><a href=""http://grandpapier.org/La-presse-independante"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grandpapier.org/La-presse-independante</a><p>But most of what I publish is in print, and some is out-of-print. I know I should put more effort in making my things available, but this definitely has a lower priority than making new comics.<p>(hrm. I notice only now I was replying to a comment by pg. It made absolutely no sense to write 'same here')",1236941849

514709,comment,514228,514228,0,0,swombat,,,"Having just been burgled last week (my flat, not my data centre) and lost 3 laptops, including a precious macbook pro, to it, I can certainly relate to the feeling of insecurity.<p>After I was burgled I was reminded of a chinese proverb, that goes along the lines of: ""A room full of jade and gold, nothing can guard it."" The point of it is that if people know you have lots of precious stuff in your room, you won't be able to stop them from breaking in eventually.<p>In my case, my laptops were visible from the street while I worked (my home office faces the street), even though I normally close the curtains in the evening, and that was probably the determining factor in drawing the burglars in. They only needed to notice the laptops once and then keep hanging around until they saw an opportunity.<p>As far as data centres are concerned, qualified thieves will obviously know for a fact that there's good stuff to be had there. If you do have such expensive, custom equipment, perhaps the only thing you can do to protect yourself is to disguise it as something else. You can't disguise the whole data centre, but you can disguise racks.<p>One possible way to do this on a large scale would be to render the server cabinets opaque, so that there is no way to identify the high-price ones from the lower price ones. This would make it harder for the thieves to ""do business"", so to speak, so they may head elsewhere because it's just not convenient.",1236941139

514696,comment,514423,514423,0,0,yason,,,"I'm afraid I'm going against the Unix idiom of combining simple tools to do more advanced stuff, I can't resists here ;_)<p>While it is idiomatic in Unix to use xargs for parallelising batch runs I found it pretty cumbersome because you have to be really careful with quotes, file names and command lines with spaces to make sure the command line will be ""nice"" in order to not fuck up something serious.<p>Moreover, xargs does have its uses but I mostly find I use it for trivial things where I can be sure it works. The xargs idiom seems to be fed a list of files, even more typically from the find command, as in ""find . -name _out | xargs rm -r"". That's the reason there's -0 in xargs while there's the matching -print0 in find.<p>I wrote a small utility myself (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/spawntool/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/spawntool/</a>) that reads from stdin and treats each line as a complete command line that is directly passed to system(), and then manages the parallelisation up to N processes.<p>This is pretty useful for feeding in _any_ batch of commands, even unrelated (not derived from a list of files). You could also feed the same input stream or file straight to 'sh' (for compatibility cross-checking) or you could verify the input command lines in plaintext before daring with either sh or spawntool. This would be like ... | xargs sh without the white-space and expansion head-aches.<p>It's pretty easy to generate complete command lines yourself and much safer than letting xargs join stuff together.",1236939661

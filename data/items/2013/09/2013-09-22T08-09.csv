I understand why rich need it - they have complex finances with multiple sources of income, bank accounts in different countries, tax management needs etc. Poor also may need it - bounced checks, cashflow problems, lack of understanding of financial products.<p>But finances for most middle-class people are plain vanilla - one or two checking accounts, credit card, simple mortgage. They do not live paycheck to paycheck so no bounced checks. There is not much space for personal interactions, especially profitable ones. Get paycheck every two weeks, pay all the bills, move whatever left to investment account. The last time I was in the bank was three years ago to do international wire transfer.<p>Good analogy - when I was poor student with crappy car that was constantly broken, mechanic was important person in my life. Car repair expenses in some months were bigger than my monthly budget and having rapport with good mechanic was important. Now I have newer car that pretty much never breaks and I do not give a damn who changes my oil as long as there is Starbucks nearby.",1379840373

This hard problem may only look like 1% of the application, but if it does not get solved, the application would have failed. That 1% requires you to build something of a similar level of difficulty as rolling your own relational database system. At least one guy has to be able to recognize the problem and to solve it. Otherwise, the other ones won&#x27;t be able to build, support and maintain the remaining 99% and won&#x27;t have a job at all.",1379840336

Computer Science is fundamentally and undisputedly a branch of mathematics. The fact that it can be practically applied, and very well so, does not detract from its roots and origin.

By adding it to all the open source data out there in the world, and using it to tell you the answers to questions you didnt know you had. Thats business intelligence.<p>The real threat of facebook is the BI layer on top of facebook warehouse. The facebook datewarehouse contains the behavior not just the thinking but also the behavior or somewhere nearing a billion people. The business intelligence layer on top of it which is just all that code they get to run covered by the terms of service that say &quot;they can run any code they want for improvement of the experience&quot;. The business intelligence on top of facebook is where every intelligence service of the world wants to go.<p>Imagine that you are a tiny little secret police organisation in some not very important country. Lets put ourselves in their position Lets call them I dont know what, you know ... &quot;kirghista&quot;.<p>You are a secret police you are in the &quot;people business&quot; secret policing is &quot;people business&quot;. You have classes of people that you want you want agents, you want sources you have adversaries, and you have influencables, that is people you torture who are related to adversaries wives, husbands, fathers, daughter you know those people.<p>So you are looking for classes of people. You dont know their names, but you know what they are like you know who is recrutable for you as an agent you know who are likely sources, you can give the social characteristics of your adversaries, and once you know your adversaries, you can find the influencables.<p>So what you want to do is run code inside facebook. It will help you find the people that you want it will show you the people whose behavior and whose social circles tell you that they are what you want by way of agent, sources what their adversaries are and who you can torture to get to them.<p>So you dont want data out of facebook the day you have data out of facebook it is dead.

4724128,comment,4721423,4721647,3,0,wickberg,,,"A few different reasons we keep them split:<p>- Jitter. Others have mentioned it, but I'll repeat it. These systems run carefully tuned microkernels to try to avoid any spurious interrupts, placing disk storage directly in the system would cause a lot of problems. Most applications require a careful lock-step progression to keep the calculations relevant; having one node take even 1% longer on a step wastes tremendous amounts of compute power for the system as a whole.<p>- System lifecycle management. As mentioned in the article, supercomputers are only cost effective to run for ~ 4 years; but data storage can outlast that. De-coupling storage and compute makes the transitions a bit easier; you can still get at the old filesystem even when the last generation machine has been scrapped. Also, this helps with access from related-but-disparate systems - you do need to get the data in and out of the machine to do anything useful with it, and potentially interrupting or degrading compute performance for external file access would be a problem.<p>- Power, and power stability - filesystems, especially large distributed systems such as Lustre/GPFS/PVFS2, do NOT handle power loss well. Best current practice for HPC centers is to keep the storage subsystems, file servers and disk arrays on backup power, but the compute side is directly run from the grid. Embedding disk in the compute would either require UPS'ing the compute platform, or anticipating filesystem corruption.<p>As with pretty much everything in the industry, people are looking at approaches to solve these. There is some inertia as you speculated, but it's becoming obvious that I/O is the new bottleneck as systems scale up any further, and you'll likely see some storage start moving in closer to the compute system.",1351705573

So the question is how long the load / unload cycle is relative to the bucket brigade cycle.<p>When constructing my earthquake preparedness kits I spent some time looking at what happened when folks were in earthquakes both in reasonable infrastructure places (Chile) and less reasonable (Haiti) and non-existant (Turkey). That led to having a 'suture kit' in my day pack because one of the common themes was that there were emergency personnel around who were trying to help but they were often without or short on basic supplies to treat severe lacerations. I have no illusions about being able to suture myself up if I needed it, but I do have hope that I could find someone with the skills to do so. And by having distributed emergency supplies with lots of people, it means that as more people collect the better supplied the resulting group will be.<p>So back to our flood, a number of buildings include a lift system on the roof for moving heavy things in and out of the building that can't go by elevator. One preparedness solution would be to have a way to utilize that system with a bunch of buckets that would let people do this without carrying up the water directly.

There are a <i>lot</i> of problems that you can solve even if the product looks like complete poop.<p>I certainly agree that design helps, and if nothing else, it helps traction.  Stripe is an example of something that could suck, but works so well that it would still solve a problem.  That said, it doesn't hurt that their product is gorgeous, and it certainly makes it more sticky in mindshare.  I still remember how giddy I got when I noticed that their documentation uses your actual API keys instead of having the dumb old ""<INSERT_YOUR_API_KEY>"" you see everywhere else.<p>I'd have still used Stripe either way, but the fit and finish throughout made me a staunch advocate for its ease of use to everybody that's ever asked me.<p>In counterpoint, Dotcloud is the cloud hosting provider I generally believe to be ""the best"".

On top of that, the dashboard they provided obviously had an abysmal level of fit and finish, and while some of its warts persist, it's come a long way.  That their product wasn't beautiful absolutely impeded my use of it in no way whatsoever.  It is easily the 'best' way to deploy code for a variety of services, whether or not it's attractive, or even 'complete'.<p><i>So long as the pain you ease is substantially greater than the pain you are introducing, the product can work.</i><p>I agree that isn't an excuse for bad design, but the notion that better design makes something better isn't necessarily a reason to always pay top dollar for it.  If you can get design on the cheap (either Bootstrap or similar products), through 99 Designs, or even by just reading a book, and execute in other areas, then you'll likely come out ahead, and revisit the design when it's more easily affordable.<p>The point though, is that the same thing could be said for engineering.  Bring in only the minimum you need to solve the problem you're trying to solve.  If you don't have a rockstar engineer, but do have somebody that can mock up a proof of concept that may or may not scale, that's what you should push forward with.<p>Like I meant to say in my previous post, I feel like we agree more than we disagree, I was just trying to point out that the priority #1 for a bootstrapped startup should be pushing product out the door.  If it's ugly, won't scale, whatever -- ship product.  Would a more attractive product be better?  Of course it would, but that shouldn't slow down shipping.",1351704270

Apparently the Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration property DHCPEnabled returns 'True' or 'False' in Python (those are strings, not bools). In C++ that's a compile time error. The Microsoft documentation says DHCPEnabled is a bool. So between implicit functionality (evaluating strings as bools) and dynamic typing, this isn't screaming scalability to me.<p>Yes, this is just one example, but it points to a whole class of errors that are lurking out there in production code.

I'm sure Braintree have their own internal calculations about how much this will cost them and that number is certainly no where near 2 million dollars.<p>3) The primary purpose of this is to bind new businesses to Braintree. The scenario of ""getting their free processing here and then going somewhere else before they pay us a nickel."" is cute, but misleading. At that point in the company's development switching the entire payments system is much more expensive and would not make any economic sense.<p>Props to Braintree for coming up with this, I think in the end it's beneficial to the startup community, though I dislike the ""second coming of jesus christ""-vibe of the announcement.

I would just say a couple of things:<p>1) Microsoft is intentionally blurring the line between tablets and PCs. Usage patterns will be different between one extreme -- something like the surface -- and the other extreme -- a tower PC / monitor combo.  But between those extremes there's a lot of middle ground; convertible tablets, laptops with touch screens, all-in-one desktops with touch screens. I don't think it's so easy to say that most people will fall into a traditional desktop usage pattern because a lot of those people won't be using a traditional desktop computer.<p>2) When you're dealing with a user base the size of Windows, even a small percentage of users using the Windows Store still adds up to a lot of people in absolute numbers; competitive with what the other tablet platforms will have.",1351703082

234186,comment,232942,233396,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I'm bootstrapping my current startup, and putting up a splash page would have taken me a couple of hours to set up a slicehost server, install a simple php script, or web framework du jour, and then code and design the splash page with the ""put your email in here"" form.<p>At this point, on my day job, my time is worth $75 an hour.  So, if I can save 6 minutes, I've saved myself $7.50.  By spending $5 a month on launchsplash, I've saved myself about $250 worth of my time.<p>It's not a matter of having to use the service.  It's a matter of expediency.  The quickest/cheapest way to get from point a to point b for me is to outsource my splash page and email collection right now.  It's not a core competency, why not outsource it?",1215013955
234185,comment,234090,234116,0,0,LogicHoleFlaw,,,"I have to disagree. I think that XML is better used for machine-consumable processes rather than human-edited ones. The wealth of tools available mitigate the need to roll your own data format and help ensure that your output will be usable by anyone with a (ubiquitous) XML parser. If your data will be used by an arbitrary 3rd party there are a lot of advantages to using XML.<p>Optimizing for ease of development is <i>certainly</i> a good goal too. Ease of development equates directly to lowered maintenance costs and redevelopment of poor code. In my business at least the maintenance costs far outweigh the initial expenditures when evaluating different technologies.<p>EDIT: I agree that SOAP is abominable. But that's due to its overall architecture rather than its use of XML.",1215013955

They have adopted a paralllel computing model (multithreading) that is known to be a pain in the ass to program. So far, they have no plans to change the model. They either don't know how or they are stuck in a rut because they need to maintain compatibility with legacy systems. They are in a state of panic right now, spending money left and right trying to find a solution that does not exist for their chosen model.

I had found Perl, Perl made me happy, therefore I needed no other languages, thankyouverymuch.<p>Over time, I've grown out of that, and have learned to appreciate learning a language simply for the sake of learning it.  Playing with Erlang and Lisp and C makes you a better Rubyist.  Sub any other languages for those 4.<p>So my advice?  Pick one.  Any one will do.  Spend a week hacking in it.  Read a little, but don't read too much without actually using the language.  Write some programs that solve a very small itch, or do something fun like simulating a swarm of bees or creating two bots that battle to the death.  Play, and then after a week or two, play with something else.<p>I think new programmers sometimes worry about learning a language that will be financially viable, or will help them get a job.  I know I did.  I also know I'm worse off for that belief.  I would have been better served, both personally and professionally, if I'd just played more.",1215012457

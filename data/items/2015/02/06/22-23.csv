You shouldn&#x27;t be discouraged - it&#x27;s on the way - but there is a reason that the major players have two OS platforms! It&#x27;s a hard software problem to solve. You have to create a full stack that will work across both device form-factors and the variety of use-cases that both supports.<p>The Ubuntu Edge campaign was aimed at trying to accelerate hardware innovation for those that wanted convergence faster. We didn&#x27;t make it - but it will still happen.<p>Separate to convergence, the &quot;next billion&quot; devices are mobile in some form. Ubuntu&#x27;s goal is to be the free software platform available to everyone [0]. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re creating a first-class phone experience. And there&#x27;s still lots of room for innovation in what phones can do and how they can be central to people&#x27;s lives.<p>So the point of today is shipping the <i>first</i> Ubuntu phones to users. I&#x27;m really looking forward to how people use, enjoy and develop with them.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu</a>",1423263519

You&#x27;re basically just asking if I&#x27;m genuine or not, and the answer is yes - I actually care. I&#x27;d rather make much less than my potential pay if doing so lifted many others out of the harsh capitalist dystopia we&#x27;ve created in the US.<p>I&#x27;m actually under the impression that everyone would get paid the same, as everyone would have an equal share of the company and profits. I honestly don&#x27;t mind if the staff packing shipping boxes gets paid the same as I do designing new robots, though it is also possible to contract out nonessential parts of the operations so that the coop employees only form the core of the company. However that seems like cheating, since you&#x27;re relying on exploited workers.<p>I believe open source robotics and solar power can free us from the shackles of work we put on ourselves in the name of productivity. I have a lot of respect for Karl Marx, but I also appreciate why so many of the Marxist experiments failed in the 20th century, and I hope that 21st century tech can change things.<p>I also believe food and housing should be made available at no cost to anyone who needs it.

Werner told us he only received permission to disclose it after our article published. Meanwhile, since our story was posted, donations flooded Werner&#x27;s website donation page and he reached his funding goal of $137,000. In addition, Facebook and the online payment processor Stripe each pledged to donate $50,000 a year to Koch’s project.<p>So yes, we still need to find a way to support these sorts of projects before they nearly collapse. But the Linux Foundation&#x27;s requirement that he not disclose the contract until after the article was published means to me that they understood there would be an outpouring of support as a &quot;reaction to social media news&quot; and didn&#x27;t want to hamper it with their $60k.<p>Say what you want about reactionary social media trends, this, and the &quot;Ice Bucket Challenge,&quot; but money is money and this isn&#x27;t a zero-sum game.

9012075,comment,9010765,9011603,0,0,drostie,,,"Okay, so, four-vectors have four components: v0, v1, v2, v3. The last three components are &quot;spatial&quot; and the first is &quot;temporal&quot;. An example of a four-vector is a 4-position of a particle moving from position (0, 0, 0) with speed u in the x-direction:<p><pre><code>   r0 = c * t\n   r1 = u * t\n   r2 = 0\n   r3 = 0\n</code></pre>\nThis is actually a family of points, one for each number t.<p>The 4-vector is a thing which everyone can agree on. (Mind you, you might disagree on the <i>components</i> of the 4-vector, but everyone agrees on the &quot;arrow&quot; in 4d space which the vector represents. That&#x27;s a little abstract and philosophical but it means that there is one objective reality which people are seeing in different ways. In particular if one person says &quot;these two particles collided at this place and time,&quot; everybody else has <i>some</i> place and time where they also saw those two particles colliding.)<p>In particular, everyone agrees on a number based on the 4-vector, which is the number v0² − v1² − v2² − v3². This is called the &quot;magnitude&quot; of V under the &quot;Lorentz metric&quot;. In our case above, the magnitude is (c² − u²) t².<p>In the particle&#x27;s own &quot;rest frame&quot; (v1 = v2 = v3 = 0) it must agree with these coordinates so we must find that its coordinates in that frame are: [√(c² − u²) t, 0, 0, 0]. But of course this must be equal to [c τ, 0, 0, 0] for the particle&#x27;s own time coordinate τ (Greek letter tau), because everybody agrees on the speed of light c and in this formalism it&#x27;s a conversion factor between space-dimensions and time dimensions. The conclusion is that t = τ / √(1 − u²/c²). This conversion factor occurs so much that it&#x27;s usually just written with a γ (Greek letter gamma) as t = γ τ. The general transform which preserves the Lorentz metric in this direction is the &quot;x-boost&quot;:<p><pre><code>    v0&#x27; = γ * (v0 − (u/c) * v1)\n    v1&#x27; = γ * (v1 − (u/c) * v0)\n    v2&#x27; = v2\n    v3&#x27; = v3\n</code></pre>\nWe can perform this &quot;boost&quot; twice, once with speed u = +w, then again with speed u = -w, to find that v0&#x27;&#x27; = v0, v1&#x27;&#x27; = v1, which proves that the mathematics is totally consistent. We can also compute (v0&#x27;)² − (v1&#x27;)² to confirm that it is the same as v0² − v1². There are other possibilities too for preserving the Lorentz metric: there are 3d space rotations with no change to v0, and boosts in other directions, and combinations of the two (what are called 4-screws). There are also reflections (flipping vi to -vi). But that&#x27;s about it. When we want to ignore the reflections we talk about &quot;proper&quot; Lorentz transforms, with the idea that reflections are somehow improper (mostly because they&#x27;re not a continuous family of transforms).<p>All of the stuff about the Pauli matrices is basically about forming the 2x2 complex matrix V =<p><pre><code>    [v0 + v3     v1 − i v2]\n    [v1 + i v2   v0 − v3  ]\n</code></pre>\nThe determinant of a matrix [a b; c d] is the product of its eigenvalues and can be calculated as a * d − b * c. This has a nice property: the determinant of a product of matrices is the product of the determinants; det(A * B) = det(A) * det(B). This matrix is also nice because it is <i>Hermitian</i>, which means that it is its own conjugate transpose. Hermitian matrices are complex matrices which have real eigenvalues.<p>Every proper Lorentz transform can be thought of as a 2x2 complex (non-Hermitian in general) matrix L. We take its conjugate-transpose L† and convert the matrix V above to be V&#x27; = L V L†. This arrangement keeps V&#x27; Hermitian, and we can work out v0, v1, v2, and v3 from its above components. The only problem is that the Lorentz metric may have changed, unless det(V&#x27;) = det(L) det(L†) det(V) = det(V). This amounts to demanding that det(L) = ±1. However, we can throw away the det(L) = -1 solutions as redundant, because if det(L) = -1 then det(i * L) = +1, but when we complex-conjugate that we get:<p><pre><code>    L V L† = 1 * L V L† = (-i * i) L V L† = (i L) V (i L)†\n</code></pre>\nso they have the exact same effect on these four-vector matrices. The Lorentz boost in the v3 direction has a very nice Lorentz matrix which looks like:<p><pre><code>    [e^(k/2)     0   ]\n    [  0     e^(-k/2)]\n</code></pre>\nRunning through the motions gives v0&#x27; + v3&#x27; = e^k (v0 + v3), v0&#x27; − v3&#x27; = e^-k (v0 − v3), which works out to v0&#x27; = cosh(k) v0 + sinh(k) v3 while v3&#x27; = sinh(k) v0 + cosh(k) v3, where sinh and cosh are the hyperbolic sines/cosines. Conclusion: the v3 boost by a speed u is defined by that matrix with k = atanh(-u/c).<p>Again, lightlike vectors (det V = 0) are projections of some 1x2 complex vector called a spinor, V = s s†. Expanding V out with s = [α; β] we find that β/α = (v1 + i v2) / (v0 + v3).<p>This is essentially a stereographic projection. To fill in the gaps, let us assume that we&#x27;ve got future-pointing vectors (v0 > 0) which are &quot;coming in towards us&quot; and need to be projected to a point on a sphere at radius 1 from which they came. After scaling the null vector by dividing by R it has some components (1, -x/R, -y/R, -z/R) where (x, y, z) is the point on the sphere of radius R which the null vector seems to be &quot;coming out of&quot;. Then -β/α is an actual stereographic projection of (x, y, z) onto the complex plane; if we take the last formula with R = 1 we get back just (x + i y) / (1 - z).<p>Lorentz matrices then transform these components directly. In the case of the v3 boost, we&#x27;re transforming -β/α to (-β/α) * e^k, so we&#x27;re just scaling the complex plane by a constant, k = -atanh(u/c).<p>If u > 0 then we are boosting towards the North pole and k is negative, so all of the stars that we see (lightlike vectors) get compressed in the stereoscopic projection towards z=0 on the complex plane. In other words, all of the stars tilt in the direction we&#x27;re going.<p>Final freebie: if something has a round outline when it is stationary, then it has a round outline when it&#x27;s moving past you, because bilinear transforms map circles to circles. The image that you see within that circle is distorted (you can imagine a bullseye target, the interior circles &quot;shift&quot; towards one of the walls of the outer circle uniformly) but the outline is still circular. In this respect, Lorentz length contraction is &quot;invisible&quot;.",1423262647

This isn&#x27;t the first time (and it won&#x27;t be the last) I&#x27;ve observed something about gender stereotypes just from having lived on both sides.<p>One stereotype that&#x27;s widely known in the trans community is that a disproportionately large percentage of trans women work in tech (or are tech hobbyists). The &quot;MtF CS nerd&quot; is probably the biggest trans stereotype I can think of.<p>This stereotype doesn&#x27;t extend to trans men (FtMs). In fact, it&#x27;s assumed that the ratio of MtFs to FtMs in tech is about the same as the ratio of cis men to cis women in tech.<p>In the main online trans community I run in, where this stereotype is endlessly touted as being true (often tongue-in-cheek), most of us start our transitions somewhere between 18-45 and by and large is biased towards people who started in our twenties (I started at 28, myself, and I&#x27;m 30 now). People who started before or after that are really rare in that particular community (there are other communities that swing younger or older, by the way -- I&#x27;m just talking about the group I run with).<p>The only real conclusion is that whatever biased us towards or against careers in tech based on our perceived genders must have occurred in childhood, definitely before college and probably before high school as well. It probably happened in toddlerhood, really. There&#x27;s an excellent SMBC comic on this, by the way, but I&#x27;m new and I don&#x27;t know if posting a link will get this post tossed into the spam filter.<p>This is why I think putting pressure on companies to recruit more and more adult women is fundamentally flawed. There just aren&#x27;t enough adult cis women who are interested, no matter how much any company tries to recruit. I&#x27;m also particularly appalled by attempts to demonize Linus Torvalds for not having enough women as core kernel developers: it&#x27;s not his fault that people perceived as female (i.e. cis girls and pre-transition FtMs) are told as early as preschool that they shouldn&#x27;t be interested in technology.

Years ago in addition to our internal IT infrastructure I had to support a third party platform (effectively an appliance in our server rack) which would constantly need to be kicked just due to end users using standard features. That was a nightmare as back then I was too eager and diligent and strove to be available to deal with things promptly whether it was responding to a crisis caused by another developer&#x27;s code or responding to a failure in the third party platform. I had all the responsibility and none of the authority to implement any definitive fixes. As you can imagine, the stress was not enjoyable and burnout was a factor.<p>Since then I&#x27;ve taken a fairly laissez-faire attitude to being on call. I&#x27;ll pick up notifications on an as available, best effort basis. That means if I&#x27;m around and get an alert, I&#x27;ll do my best to resolve the issue right away. However, if I&#x27;m with friends, my phone will be in my jacket pocket hanging in a closet somewhere while I might be drinking and I&#x27;ll see any alerts when I&#x27;m leaving for the night. That could be many, many hours later. I make no effort to restrict my activities so that I&#x27;m always around. And if I leave my phone on vibrate and don&#x27;t pick up any alerts while I enjoy a sound night&#x27;s sleep, so be it.<p>If &quot;as available, best effort&quot; on my part isn&#x27;t good enough, then the company will need to compensate me appropriately for the interruption that comes from a higher level of commitment. Some physicians get $100/day and cardiologists get up to $1600/day to be on call[0] as they need to limit their plans and avoid activities which make them unavailable.<p>In a nutshell, if getting paged at all hours of the day and night and having quick responses to issues is important enough then the company needs to pay for your time, lifestyle interruption, and mental energy at a rate you think is fair. I suggest a minimum daily/weekly/monthly rate based on making yourself available plus hourly compensation for the actual time you put in at a 1.5x or 2x hourly rate. This all goes out the window if you&#x27;re in some scrappy underfunded startup, but if you&#x27;re employed in a company which has graduated from shoestring budgets and has paying customers and decent revenue then you should be getting something for what is effectively overtime.<p>[0] <a href=""http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/medical-economics/news/modernmedicine/modern-medicine-news/daily-pay-call-coverage-increases?page=full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/medical-economics...</a>",1423261630

JS is sometimes hard to optimize to Java-like speed.<p>I think (1) is already well underway to being solved, through compiling to JS. Things like TypeScript, CoffeeScript, ClojureScript, Elm, Scala.js, GWT, JSIL, Emscripten, etc. Those let you compile whatever language you want, without all the JS oddities. You can use anything from a familiar language like Java or C# or C++ or Scala, to an almost-JS language like TypeScript. People aren&#x27;t really limited by JavaScript&#x27;s oddities anymore.<p>It&#x27;s true these languages sometimes have downsides when compiled, e.g. due to limitations on debugging.

Given that most engineering programs draw from the 600-800 range, how on earth do you explain the 4:1-5:1 disparities you observe in these programs in the face of a much lower disparity in mathematical aptitude in the relevant range?\nMoreover, if the disparities are rooted in biology rather than sociology, how do you explain why the percentage of CS degrees awarded to women is half of what it was 30 years ago?<p>This is perfectly in line with the statement I made. Just because females with high SATs are more than capable of doing CS, doesn&#x27;t mean they are interested in it as a career. This is most likely due to their innate predispositions for other types of work. This may be tough for lifelong programmers to understand, but the majority of computer scientists see this field as just work and nothing else. There is none of that Zuckerbergian passion that drives most programmers.<p>A great example is a guy like Elon Musk, vs a guy like Linus Torvalds. Both undoubtedly prodigious programmers, but one kept doing it even when he no longer hand to, and the other jumped ship onto his other, more pressing, passions.<p>From a personal example, a close female relative of mine is a brilliant girl who has outperformed me at every academic level. She chose to specialize in the medical field, because it suited her interests more. She is incredible at math and would have made an excellent programmer, but she just doesn&#x27;t have a passion to spend the rest of her life doing it.<p>What my argument boils down to is this: girls and boys are biologically different, and thus they enjoy doing different things.

When you think about it, if everyone is already working full time and the pager goes off 5 or 6 times a month and each incident requires about 2-3 hours across 3 people they are essentially wage stealing 20-30 hours a month.

9011852,comment,9011436,9011436,0,0,FD3SA,,,"Interesting how the mainstream media keeps doing circles around these issues.<p>When you start with flawed assumptions, you will never get an accurate solution. The hypothesis that vicious and systemic oppression of females since birth is keeping them out of Computer Science is hardly sound. While there may be an element of discrimination in all professions that tend to be dominated by one sex, I think it&#x27;s time to look a little more closely at the situation.<p>Humans are a sexually dimorphic species. This means that on a genetic and physiological level, our sexes are distinct barring genetic anomalies such as Klinefelter syndrome and other rare conditions. Now as with anything that deals with biology, there is a massive amount of variation within each classification category, i.e. sex. This being said, we can and have done studies measuring the distribution (mean and variation) of tendencies for both sexes to find that they are quite distinct at a physiological level.<p>This means that when comparing the mean male adult brain to the mean female adult brain, the neural architecture is quite distinctly different. This has natural consequences in our behavior, predispositions, illnesses and life outcomes.<p>For example, it is found that the mean male does better on visuospatial tasks than the mean female, whereas females tend to do better on verbal tasks. Now all the usual disclaimers apply about cognitive testing biases and sample populations, but there is a slight empirical difference.<p>This is why in certain Nordic countries which pride themselves on being the most sexually egalitarian, the polarization of traditional careers is at a record high. For example, comparing two equally lucrative professions, on average men tend to study engineering and females tend towards nursing. As these countries have worked tirelessly to eradicate discrimination from their education, social, legal and professional systems, the only variable left to control for is personal preference which tends to gravitate towards sexual averages.<p>In conclusion, I find it often helps to frame a problem from an empirical point of view before assuming the cause and prescribing a treatment a priori.<p>Now, are all the developed countries in the world at the level of the Nordic countries in terms of sexual egalitarianism? Most likely not, though I doubt they&#x27;re exactly Saudi Arabia either, which some of the more radical pundits tend to vociferously imply publicly at every opportunity.<p>Empirical and rational thought are gifts left to us by our ancestors after thousands of years of toil. I find it disappointing that we constantly fall into these irrational situations simply due to knee-jerk emotional outrage over perceived injustices. I hope one day rationality and empirical thought become the core education platform for mankind.",1423260269

601680,comment,601475,601475,0,0,whacked_new,,,"I wonder about the change in marriage dynamics here.<p>Suppose you have a decade of fellows who, due to bad luck, are on a low-earning streak compared to those in the preceding years. Would this add incentive for the women of the right age, from the current decade, to marry men from the preceding ""block""?<p>Alternatively, suppose all earnings are down, which means that relatively everybody is still about the same, within the current decade ""block"". Then women won't have much incentive to marry the older men.<p>But I think the previous case is more likely. Then we will have some kind of a gap in M/F distributions among the age groups. How would the current decade block's males adapt? When the women of the subsequent decade block enter the workforce, the males from the current block will have to compete with the males in the next block as well, but won't have much advantage from greater salary.<p>So it looks like a slow correction, a loss, to me, i.e. there will simply be an increased number of bachelors in this block.",1241917167

Just a few quick pointers and hints, things that must be passed on:<p>* Learn how to find <i>good</i> information. Hone your bullshit detector, learn who knows what they're talking about and who is full of it (many will try to sell you things, if not an actual product or service, then their personality: good hackers are selfless and rarely sign their work.)<p>* Get heroes. Find good hackers to imitate. I grew up wanting to be ""like Terje Mathisen"" ..<p>* Avoid fluff mediums. Best information is found in ASCII mediums :-P just my finding. Avoid the blog scene, most of it is written to pad an ego or a resume. Usenet is good, sparingly. Citeseer is good when you know better. The underground zines are good, with a grain of salt.<p>* Discover the past; everything you need to know about computing was invented/discovered before 1980. Mine the past, seek the originators, not the imitators. Nothing good happened since 1999; the greatest minds left the Science and went to industry, behind NDAs, patents and sold to ""investors"".<p>* Don't do the web, yet. Start working in the console, then perhaps do a tangible GUI. Don't do Unicode<p>* ACM, IEEE and Elsevier are bastards. If you need a paper, google the authors' websites and you can usually find it there.<p>* It's OK to be in hackmode. If you need to get away from society, you are allowed to forgo all human contact and basic hygiene until you figure shit out.<p>* Mathematics is easy. The smaller and denser the text the better. It's the long, repetitive hammer-into-your-head crap that probably bored you in school. Real mathematics is neat and compact. Get math books with answers to the exercises at the back. Don't cheat yourself.<p>* Save your first programs, even print them out. You will be willing to give up everything just to get them back, should you lose them (and remain a programmer ;-)<p>* Learn assembly language. Learn C. Learn how to write your own tools. Programming tools should be the first systems you investigate. Levine's book ""Linkers and Loaders"" is free online. You can find ""Advanced DOS"" on Alexie Frounze's site. K&R is online. Unix is good. Learn it well, at the kernel level. Familiarize yourself executable file formats. Get into compiler hacking early, it will enlighten you, but will also force you to learn so many different languages you will have no time for anything else.<p>* Share what you learned, even if you have to cringe at your own verbosity :-)",1241914527

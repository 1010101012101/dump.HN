551330,comment,550583,550663,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>Maybe Perl 6 will have meta-language power enough to equal the macro system?</i><p>Not only does it have full-on raging macros, you can redefine the languages own syntax inline.  Check out one of Larry's recent talks about STD.pm (here's a Google Tech Talk from last year, which is nowhere near as funny as Larry usually is, but is still quite informative: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzIWdJVP-wo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzIWdJVP-wo</a> )for a real ""when you see it, you'll shit bricks"" moment.  Perl 6 is far more intimidating than I ever realized.  They seem to have looked at everything good about Perl (and a handful of other languages) and said, ""Let's do a lot more of that.""  It's somewhat scary how much more of ""that"" they've done.  So, there's macros from Lisp, lazy evaluation from Haskell, redefine-able grammar and syntax from I dunno where, a new regex language, etc.  It takes TMTOWTDI to obscene new heights (kinda like Lisp).  If power is the sole determining factor in what language you choose, there's a strong case to be made that Perl 6 is the one you want.  I don't know that I entirely buy that (if I did, I guess I'd be using Lisp), but I'm hopeful that the real result of Perl 6 will be a language as capable as Lisp with a community and library culture as strong as Perl 5.",1239126706

551318,comment,551051,551239,0,0,modoc,,,"You've read a great deal into my comment that wasn't there.  Not blaming you, written comments aren't the best means of communication.<p>Most high schools, including one I went to in a very poor blue collar ex-fishing town, offer tutoring, clubs, athletics, and access to the ""computer lab"".  The issue is that, in general (there are exceptions of course), kids who's parents didn't put much emphasis on eduction, and who didn't expose their child to the concept that they can do anything, be anything, that their potential is limitless, weren't at all interested in taking advantage of those programs.  They'd rather hang out with their friends and/or get into trouble.  The problem isn't that the schools aren't offering those types of supports, the issue is that the parental and culture influences drive the kids away from those educationally supporting offerings.<p>By the time you hit high school, (again, in general), you're either focused on education, or you're not.  I think parents play the largest role, with the societal obsession with sports, hip hop stars, and anti-intellectualism playing a smaller but significant role.<p>Part of it also is that some people are smarter than other.  Some people are better at math, or computers, or art, or football than others.  Some people simply work harder than others.  People tend to gravitate to things they enjoy, especially for after school elective programs.  Your average 90 IQ kid isn't going to want to spend afternoons struggling to succeed on the debate team.  Doubly so because everyone who's not on the debate team tends to make fun of the kids who are.<p>I'm not suggesting society needs misery or unhappiness to function.  I have no idea where that came from.  I'm just suggesting that there will always be a wide range of salaries based on supply, demand, how replaceable you are, etc...  Both of my divorced parents probably gross about $30k/year each.  They're both very happy, and not miserable at all.  If I could no longer work with computers I think I could be quite happy as a baker or a motorcycle mechanic, making 1/10 of what I make now.  I don't want people to be unhappy, nor do I think there's any societal requirement for misery.  All I said was I don't see how everyone can make $100k/year and work in cushy offices.<p>In addition to my time at the blue collar high school, I also attending Phillips Academy at Andover, one of the best private prep schools in the US.  Was the quality of eduction there better than the blue collar school?  Absolutely.  The teachers were amazing, the resources were amazing, etc...  If you made every high school like Andover (ignoring the factors that make this impossible - lack of teachers of that skill level, break-down in the culture, cost, etc...) would that make everyone rich and successful?  Not a chance!  Yes, some kids would do very well, and would be better off than otherwise.  The vast majority would flunk out due to not being able to keep up, or not being willing to put in the time/effort (again goes back to a combination of innate traits and abilities and parental influence during childhood).  Obviously you can't have them all flunk out, since all the schools are now like this, so they don't fail, they move along, but they aren't keeping up with the teaching (assuming the teachers stay at the pace of the kids who are really getting the most of out this), so they don't pay attention, and they get bored, and they get nothing out of it, and end up just distracting the kids who are trying to learn.  Oh wait, that's already what happened in every high school where the teachers don't cater to the lowest common denominator.<p>Anyhow, this is turning into a rant.  I think that offering great education at the college level, or even the high school level will actually help a very small number of people.  I'm not saying we shouldn't do it, but we shouldn't expect massive changes.<p>Artificially inflating the wages of low skill, easily replaceable jobs, such as street sweeping devalues money across the board, and helps no one.",1239126224

But moreso the folks who complain about parentheses.  I suspect that anyone who uses that as their reason for not learning or liking Lisp simply would never consider Lisp long enough to know anything more about the language.  I just think it's more likely because they like ""industry standard"" languages, and have no obvious on-the-job use for Lisp, but they don't want to say ""I am intellectually incurious about languages and different programming paradigms"".  I think those same people would never learn Lua or Haskell, despite a distinct lack of crazy parentheses.<p><i>Many people complain about parentheses</i><p>Many people complain about significant whitespace in Python and sigils in Perl.  Either one has orders of magnitude more developers and more code being written in it on a daily basis.  It is a triviality, and the kind of folks who pick out trivialities to complain about are not the kind of folks you can convert.  They're not going to learn your favorite language, unless you make it look exactly like their favorite language.  Since Lisp can't look like Java or C# or C or Visual Basic or PHP, without losing a lot of what makes Lisp Lisp, that's not a useful pursuit.<p>So, I'm simply saying that talking over parentheses over and over again is ignoring the real problems and focusing on the one that everyone knows won't change.  It's a perfect flame war talking point, but it's not what's keeping people away from Lisp.",1239125708

It's a fun project, and it teaches you a lot about programming, even if you don't do the tricky parts (like full continuations). This seems to feed a strong ""just fork your own"" sentiment in the community, though, and that probably leads directly to a mishmash of incompatible libraries. That's Scheme, though, not Common Lisp; CL was an attempt to reign in several divergent Lisp dialects.<p>Also, I think people overuse macros. Certain people have put a lot of time into promoting them as the biggest asset of the language, which tends to encourage people to use them where they're not only unnecessary, but likely to make code harder to understand / maintain. (See, for instance, <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=542746"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=542746</a>.

The greatest benefit of using a debugger is to get a holistic view of what is really going on in your program right now, which may not match your preconceived notions of what you think it's doing. There's no way you can make the machine give you that kind of insight. I make it a practice to step through all of my code, even when it works correctly and I've written unit tests for everything. By watching the live view of control flow and variables I often find defects that hadn't yet shown up as visible bugs, or realize that there is a better way to do something.<p>In my experience, the programmers who don't like or use interactive debuggers have never learned to use a really good one.",1239123956

The first is about languages; the second is \nabout people.<p>Assuming the latter, what's the evidence? Many people complain about parentheses, so it seems that it is an active reason, but without a rigorous survey (""Why do <i>you</i> hate lisp?""), it's hard to know.<p>The issue with parentheses is not about ""hate"" at all, but confusion. If you are 100% determined to learn something no matter what, you can probably learn it. But in reality, when you start to learn something, you are also assessing if it is worth the effort of learning.<p>The context of my first experience with lisp was that it was supposed to be more ""mathematical"" than other languages - and so I assumed the parentheses were used as they are in expressions, that is, for grouping. But they aren't used in that way in Lisp - they mean function call, like f(x), but with yet another syntax. So, my 5 minute cursory foray into Lisp ended with me concluding that Lisp was unexpectedly inconsistent. Since that's against my usability values, I didn't spend further time on it (since then, I have spent further time).<p>I didn't <i>hate</i> the parentheses; I just found their meaning elusive.",1239123837

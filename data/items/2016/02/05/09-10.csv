If you&#x27;re kicked out entirely, that changes the trade structure that your economy has adapted to over the time the treaty was in place. You&#x27;ll face serious opposition from businesses that have grown to depend on those new trade arrangements.<p>Local laws can be adapted piecemeal, but my understanding is that a treaty like this is all or nothing.",1454663127

To find out, the team examined data from 381 people. They found an association between glucose intolerance and general sweetener use.</i><p>and:<p><i>To explore this, the team asked seven healthy people who don&#x27;t normally consume sweeteners to eat the FDA&#x27;s maximum daily allowance of saccharin. ... By day five, four of the seven people had a significant decrease in their glucose tolerance, while three saw no change. Sequencing showed that those who responded to the sweetener started out with different gut bacteria to those who didn&#x27;t respond. What&#x27;s more, the gut bacteria of the four responders changed significantly after consuming sweeteners, while the non-responders&#x27; barely changed.</i>",1410983978

When there is known to be a different bioavailability or digestive response in animals from humans, then the dose is adjusted with that in mind before the experiment begins.<p>So, no, the tiny bodies of mice were not subjected to the large servings that much bigger human beings eat.

8331991,comment,8325394,8330599,1,0,innguest,,,"Have you ever worked as a waiter in a restaurant? Some restaurants let waiters keep all their tip, while others force waiters to share their tips equally in a collective pool.<p>Those that let waiters keep all their tip argue that the server has more motivation to give better service if they see the proportional impact of their effort. That makes servers happy which rubs off on customers, making the experience better for everyone involved. It is a win-win system that encourages self-improvement and punishes slackers.<p>On the other hand, restaurants that pool their tips see everything in terms of a team effort. They argue that because of the initial training investment, they want to make sure no details are missed and the only way to do that is by encouraging collectivist thinking. Tip sharing is preferred in restaurants that offer a richer, more complicated experience (having to educate customers on what they&#x27;re ordering, answering questions about fancy food and wine and pairing them, etc). They also argue that tip sharing makes servers more fungible in that they can switch between roles - waiting, busing, serving drinks.<p>The first system (&quot;keep tip&quot;) is simple to explain and is self-correcting. If a server underperforms it&#x27;s easy to see and intervene. The second system (&quot;tip pool&quot;) feels &quot;bigger&quot;, has more moving parts (tips changing hands), and requires constant surveillance by the servers themselves, not to mention some bureaucracy to manage the money division. The keep-tip system can be said to be immune to slackers because a slacker cannot adversely affect the system beyond the scope of the slacker (other than dissatisfied customers not coming back); but slackers are a huge burden on the tip-pool system, as they effectively steal money from the other servers by not pulling their own weight as much as the others. This is a disincentive for the individual waiter that is above average and could be keeping more of their tips elsewhere.<p>Despite the differences and the different opinions we can draw from them, both kinds of restaurants exist, but in the keep-tip type, waiters can be said to have more freedom and they have the right to keep the fruits of their labor. I&#x27;ve informally asked my friends and they all said if they could choose between keep-tip and tip-pool they&#x27;d choose keep-tip. So it must be the case that someone else other than waiters is benefiting from tip-pool systems.<p>Now imagine trying to change a restaurant&#x27;s tipping system. You say that because the pool-tip restaurant provided training, it&#x27;s only fair that they contribute to the tip-pool. Then one of the waiters proposes a new system where there is no tip-pool, and claims the restaurant would work just as well, if not better, if it adopted keep-tip. Of course the other waiters argue &quot;we work in a restaurant where we all pool tips for the good of all (busboys, dish cleaners, cooks, etc) and if someone benefits from this environment without paying into the pool, they&#x27;re stealing from the rest of us&quot;. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth.",1410983148

Yet some questions in other comments raise issues that are already responded to by the article abstract. Here is the full text of the article abstract available in the free view at the link:<p>&quot;Non-caloric artificial sweeteners (NAS) are among the most widely used food additives worldwide, regularly consumed by lean and obese individuals alike. NAS consumption is considered safe and beneficial owing to their low caloric content, yet supporting scientific data remain sparse and controversial. Here we demonstrate that consumption of commonly used NAS formulations drives the development of glucose intolerance through induction of compositional and functional alterations to the intestinal microbiota. These NAS-mediated deleterious metabolic effects are abrogated by antibiotic treatment, and are fully transferrable to germ-free mice upon faecal transplantation of microbiota configurations from NAS-consuming mice, or of microbiota anaerobically incubated in the presence of NAS. We identify NAS-altered microbial metabolic pathways that are linked to host susceptibility to metabolic disease, and demonstrate similar NAS-induced dysbiosis and glucose intolerance in healthy human subjects. Collectively, our results link NAS consumption, dysbiosis and metabolic abnormalities, thereby calling for a reassessment of massive NAS usage.&quot;<p>AFTER EDIT: After reading all the comments in this thread to the time of this edit, I see that some participants here disagree entirely with how I commented at first (as above). I note their opinion with interest and say here for the record simply that I saw previous comments that raised questions about information that is available in the article abstract for all of us to read. I meanwhile did find my workaround to get the full text of the article (I have library access with journal subscriptions for one aspect of my work, which is rather slow and buggy) and from the full article text I see that the experimental approach the researchers tried--feeding mice with the artificial sweetener to see if that changed gut microbiota in the mice, and then transferring the gut microbiota to other mice--did indeed bring about clinical signs consistent with the idea that the sweetener itself might cause related clinical signs in human beings.<p>&quot;To test whether the microbiota role is causal, we performed faecal transplantation experiments, by transferring the microbiota configuration from mice on normal-chow diet drinking commercial saccharin or glucose (control) into normal-chow-consuming germ-free mice (Extended Data Fig. 1e). Notably, recipients of microbiota from mice consuming commercial saccharin exhibited impaired glucose tolerance as compared to control (glucose) microbiota recipients, determined 6 days following transfer (P < 0.03, Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 2e). Transferring the microbiota composition of HFD-consuming mice drinking water or pure saccharin replicated the glucose intolerance phenotype (P < 0.004, Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 2f). Together, these results establish that the metabolic derangements induced by NAS consumption are mediated by the intestinal microbiota.&quot;<p>This preliminary finding, which of course needs to be replicated, has caused alarm in the industry, according to the link participant nostromo kindly shared in this thread.[1] There is epidemiological signal that human beings who consume a lot of artificial sweeteners are not especially healthy people compared to people who consume few. Teasing out the mechanism that may underly that observational finding will take more research, but this is important research to get right.<p>&quot;To study the functional consequences of NAS consumption, we performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing of faecal samples from before and after 11 weeks of commercial saccharin consumption, compared to control mice consuming either glucose or water. To compare relative species abundance, we mapped sequencing reads to the human microbiome project reference genome database16. In agreement with the 16S rRNA analysis, saccharin treatment induced the largest changes in microbial relative species abundance (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table 2; F-test P value < 10−10). These changes are unlikely to be an artefact of horizontal gene transfer or poorly covered genomes, because changes in relative abundance were observed across much of the length of the bacterial genomes, as exemplified by one overrepresented (Bacteroides vulgatus, Extended Data Fig. 7a) and one underrepresented species (Akkermansia muciniphila, Extended Data Fig. 7b).&quot;<p>The authors sum up their experimental findings by writing<p>&quot;In summary, our results suggest that NAS consumption in both mice and humans enhances the risk of glucose intolerance and that these adverse metabolic effects are mediated by modulation of the composition and function of the microbiota. Notably, several of the bacterial taxa that changed following NAS consumption were previously associated with type 2 diabetes in humans13, 20, including over-representation of Bacteroides and under-representation of Clostridiales. Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative taxa contributed to the NAS-induced phenotype (Fig. 1a, b) and were enriched for glycan degradation pathways (Extended Data Fig. 6), previously linked to enhanced energy harvest (Fig. 2c, d)11, 24. This suggests that elaborate inter-species microbial cooperation may functionally orchestrate the gut ecosystem and contribute to vital community activities in diverging environmental conditions (for example, normal-chow versus high-fat dietary conditions). In addition, we show that metagenomes of saccharin-consuming mice are enriched with multiple additional pathways previously shown to associate with diabetes mellitus23 or obesity11 in mice and humans, including sphingolipid metabolism and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis25.&quot;<p>There have been a lot of questions raised in this thread, and indeed the article itself raises plenty of interesting questions to follow up with further research. When discussing a new preliminary research finding like this, we can work outward from the article abstract to news reports about the article findings to the article text itself to focus on the known issues and define clearly the unknown issues. I appreciate comments from anyone here about how I can help contribute to more informed and thoughtful, in Hacker News sense of &quot;thoughtful,&quot;[2] discussion of research on human nutrition.<p>Other comments here asked why we should respect journal paywalls at all, and the basic answer to that question is a basic principle of economics, that people respond to incentives. (That&#x27;s the same reason you don&#x27;t found a startup that you expect will always lose money for all time.) <i>Nature</i> is one of the most-cited scientific journals in the world, so it&#x27;s a big coup to be published there, and that means <i>Nature</i> gets a lot of submissions. To slog through all the submissions with adequate editorial work does cost money. (I used to be a junior editor of an academic journal.) The article gets more attention (it has received a lot of attention in this thread) if it is in a better rather than worse journal. Some journals are lousy enough to publish anything, and those journals beg for submissions, but <i>Nature</i> can charge for subscriptions and impose paywalls (which expire for government-funded research, with author sharing of author manuscripts on free sites usually being mandatory after a year embargo) because what it publishes is often worth reading (as here).<p>AFTER ONE MORE EDIT:<p>I see that while I was reading the fine article from <i>Nature</i> submitted to open a thread, my comment is now part of a thread that is about the <i>New Scientist</i> popular article on the same research finding. This will be confusing to readers newly visiting this thread. The title of the <i>Nature</i> article is &quot;Artificial sweeteners induce glucose intolerance by altering the gut microbiota&quot; (the Hacker News thread title I saw, per the usual rule of using the article headline as the submission headline) and the article DOI is<p>10.1038/nature13793<p>for the full article published online (behind a paywall) on 17 September 2014.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329872.600-artificial-sweeteners-linked-to-glucose-intolerance.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329872.600-artificia...</a><p>[2] &quot;The most important principle on HN, though, is to make thoughtful comments.

In this example, this component could be the row itself the parent table or something higher up, depending on how you structured your app (there are pros and cons to each alternative here).

However, when non-primate species (e.g.,  a dog) eat something containing xylitol, the xylitol is quickly absorbed into the bloodstream, resulting in a potent release of insulin from the pancreas.  This rapid release of insulin results in a rapid and profound decrease in the level of blood sugar (hypoglycemia), an effect that occurs within 10-60 minutes of eating the xylitol. Untreated, this [canine] hypoglycemia can be life-threatening.</i>",1410980699

This doesn&#x27;t make the library useless, because you can still use it in internal applications or pre-release versions of your app, but &quot;We need to ship to the App Store&quot; is a fairly big bullet point for a lot of potential customers of e.g. a SDK which lets you edit PDF files on an iDevice in an arbitrary application.  That particular feature occurs in a <i>lot</i> of enterprise apps, because the enterprise runs on PDFs.  So if you say &quot;Totally free for your geeks to use internally, and btw, $2500 if they want to put it on the App Store&quot;, you&#x27;ll collect more in a single license sale than 99.99% of donationware apps make in a month.<p>This is called the dual licensing model.

However for mass market as many here have said we are just not there yet.<p>To get there we really need to have a few innovative large manufacturers start publishing replacement part CAD models for their products. Making that leap is obviously a big deal for a lot of manufacturers who make outstanding margin on their replacement parts, but that is the kind of thing we need in order for a printer to be useful to the truly mass market.<p>Additionally, and I think we&#x27;re seeing this already, we need a lot more 3d printable products to come to market. For example, I just recently finished printing a Clug bike rack for a friend (<a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/834664305/clug-cycle-storage-thats-like-a-hug-for-your-bike"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/834664305/clug-cycle-st...</a>). This is a prime example of bringing 3d printing to the general public - they provide a high quality version you can buy, or a cheap 3d printable version which you can pay a lot less for just the 3d files. We worked out that with the model cost and the material cost you could print somewhere in the region of 30 replacements before it was more economical to buy the mass produced high quality version.

I&#x27;m really not sure this was the &quot;free exchange of ideas&quot; which science is based upon.<p>Even the New York times only charges $3.75/week (the nature price is per article/view NOT per week, it would be $4.14 if their $199 plan was weekly) and the NYT has to actually pay journalists to create the content. Nature gets all their content for free.<p>So what are Nature&#x27;s expenses anyway? They no longer have to type set as it is just an identical PDF which is sent to them. Is hosting and management of the web-site really so costly that it is $3.99/article?",1410980423

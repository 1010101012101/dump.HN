You need to develop something to show someone you're passionate about it.  I've tried to pitch ideas on paper (or on a PPT presentation), and you'll never get anywhere.  That's one of the most important things I learned, see #3 in my article I wrote here: <a href=""http://jtame05.wordpress.com/2007/03/10/5-tips-for-students-seeking-vc-funding/"">http://jtame05.wordpress.com/2007/03/10/5-tips-for-students-seeking-vc-funding/</a>",1177541984

16824,comment,16761,16761,0,0,JMiao,,,"A brand/product can be subtly inserted into film or television.  Imagine how ridiculous it would sound if the author starting explicitly calling out products in his descriptions (not to mention the damage to a reader's immersion).  Additionally, most ad buyers (the guys who pay for this stuff) probably wouldn't be interested paying for placement lost amongst text on a page of paper.<p>You can include calling out ""McDonalds"" in your writing, but it just doesn't sound like something McDonalds would want to pay for.  Of course, you could then write an entire novel based around McDonalds, but propaganda is another thing, heh.  Besides, who would want to buy a novel about McDonalds?  =)

Regardless, we had such different schedules, it didn't really matter.  Usually when one person was asleep - the other two would be working.",1177541211

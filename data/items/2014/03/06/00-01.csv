In the UK, Stripe is not a well-known organisation in the way that say a high street bank is...<p>I am pretty shocked this came as a surprise... customers are not developers: Stripe is just a credit card processing company, providing no user-focussed services (as does your bank, PayPal, or Square, all companies a user might plausibly have heard of and could theoretically have some positive trust associated with: of course, one would also be surprised if a user recognized &quot;Square&quot; even if they use one every day at some restaurant, and depending on your target market they might also not have heard of &quot;PayPal&quot;, and while large banks tend to have a lot of brand recognition, it tends to be tied to local regions where the bank operates).",1394067385

7351114,comment,7346454,7350545,2,0,alex-g,,,"Yes, the interface idea is basically the right thing, but there are technical difficulties which aren&#x27;t immediately obvious. For example, we&#x27;d like to be able to prove that two different implementations of the natural numbers are equivalent (one can do this mathematically, so if our system is going to handle general mathematics then it has to be capable of doing this). So we have to think quite hard about what this &quot;equivalence&quot; actually means. It&#x27;s not enough to say that they satisfy the same axioms, because in general there can be all kinds of models for some set of axioms. It&#x27;s closer to say that all number-theoretic statements about numbers-v1 are true of numbers-v2, and vice versa: but you can see that this is starting to get a bit hairy in terms of computable proofs.<p>A related problem, which speaks to the leaky abstraction issue, is &quot;proof irrelevance&quot;. Typically, if I&#x27;ve proved something, it shouldn&#x27;t matter exactly how I did it. But it turns out to be tricky to make sure that the proof objects in the system don&#x27;t accidentally carry too much information about where they came from. Sure, you can define a way to erase the details, but you still have to prove that erasing doesn&#x27;t mess up the deductive system.<p>None of this is insurmountable, but it&#x27;s a glimpse into the reasons why encoding mathematics computationally is not trivial.",1394067172

If you&#x27;re halfway decent, people will be falling over themselves to hire you.  Of course some skills will stand you in better stead than others; a GitHub full of Ruby/Python/Javascript is a lot more attractive in SF than a resume full of C# jobs.<p>The real worry right now is housing.  You state that you&#x27;d like a convenient place to live.  Given that a great many startups these days are in San Francisco, that means paying SF rents, or sacrificing convenience.  You can afford SF rents by taking a roommate and living cheaply for surprisingly little - I know people doing it on $50-60K, but they have partners who earn significantly more.<p>If you want to do it solo, shoot for at least $130K or above.  You&#x27;re in a fiercely competitive rental market, and as someone without friends or connections should expect to pay $2-5k/mo just on rent, depending on your area.  If that sounds extravagant, consider the numbers.  At the high end of the range (and that&#x27;s something like a good-sized one-bedroom apartment in SOMA), you&#x27;re potentially spending $60K per year just on housing, in one of the highest-tax areas of the country.<p>The good news is that, if you&#x27;re halfway decent, that&#x27;s a very achievable salary.  If you&#x27;re good, you can earn far more, but <i>generally</i> that requires moving south.<p>As far as finding friends and jobs, I had good luck hanging out at hacker spaces like Hacker Dojo in Mountain View, Noisebridge in SF, Sudo Room in Oakland, and a host of others.  You&#x27;ll find like-minded friends, housing connections, and jobs there.  Programming meetups are a great way to connect professionally.  Dolores Park in the Mission is a glorious place to spend the spring and summer, and it&#x27;s always full of people on nice days.<p>I&#x27;d be remiss if I didn&#x27;t mention that my company is hiring for Android, iOS, and JVM/Python backend roles - if that&#x27;s up your alley, we&#x27;d love to talk to you, my username at Google&#x27;s fine webmail service.",1394066074

You can read a famous essay called &quot;Lockhart&#x27;s Lament&quot; for more about this subject.  But that&#x27;s not something that&#x27;s happening right now either in classrooms or on the standardized tests.<p>My point is that you have to teach <i>something</i> in high school, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like the new SAT tests anywhere near four years&#x27; worth of content.<p>> linear equations; complex equations or functions; and ratios, percentages and proportional reasoning<p>&quot;Linear equations&quot; are a topic that can easily be taught in a month or less.  &quot;Complex equations or functions&quot; is unclear, but I assume this means quadratic equations or maybe basic trigonometry -- probably a semester&#x27;s worth or less.  &quot;Ratios, percentages and proportional reasoning&quot; is really middle school level math -- or even elementary school level.  It doesn&#x27;t belong in a high school curriculum, except as review or remedial material.<p>So all of this content consumes less than a year of high school.  I agree that maybe four years of intensive math coursework may be the wrong bar to set for the SAT, but is it setting the bar too high to expect college-bound seniors to know more than a single year worth of math content?<p>For that matter, only the best students should be expected to get a high score on the SAT; otherwise, the SAT score becomes meaningless.  So I should re-phrase the question:<p>Is it setting the bar too high to expect the best math students among college-bound seniors to know more than a single year worth of math content?",1394065402

I&#x27;ve heard from countless parents who hired us for in person tutoring after their kid didn&#x27;t stay motivated with online prep. Moreover, students preparing on their own have a massive inclination to prep on sections they enjoy rather than their weakest sections.<p>* Video explanations inevitably fail to significantly change results because:\n A) learning becomes passive\n B) immediate feedback lacks\n C) individual explanations for questions tend toward &quot;tactics&quot; rather than &quot;strategy&quot; or a cohesive approach that can be applied to a wide variety of problems<p>* the first online test prep that will be effective will be the prep that solves A, B, and C<p>* Seceral people here have stated the only way to prepare for this test is to take practice tests over and over again. That&#x27;s like suggesting a MLB pitcher becomes an MLB pitcher just by throwing a ball over and over again. Sure practice is essential but if you don&#x27;t have the right technique or the right muscle strength then you will never significantly improve.<p>* While the SAT and ACT are not IQ tests, SAT/ACT scores are correlated with IQ scores. If the tests don&#x27;t feel &quot;fair&quot; well at least they are a heck of a lot more fair than gpa (grade inflation, teacher variance, school type, etc).<p>* Understanding how to &quot;beat the test&quot; is never explained by people who say that&#x27;s all it takes. Developing smart test taking strategies develops good decision making strategies so preparing for the test is arguably as valuable as a strong test score.<p>* Those of you who say the SAT/ACT are really easy are being douchey. If you&#x27;re on y combinator you&#x27;re probably smart so you don&#x27;t need to show your insecurity with statements like that.

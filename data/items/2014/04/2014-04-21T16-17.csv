White labeled customer (developer) facing api&#x27;s, <i>I believe</i>. I&#x27;m not entirely certain how this scales for ST because even though they will provide a standard forward facing api, ST will have to custom fit that on the backend to each customer. (Possibly more disjointed than the industry I&#x27;m involved with, healthcare, because at least in healthcare there are a handful of major EMR vendors that all the major institutions use.) In Big Finance most everything is custom legacy, I would imagine. On top of all this, they have the taint of the startup about them. Large industry is loathe to get in bed with startups simply because they are not proven and can not be relied upon in the long term, further, startups are prone to get acquired. How would you like to be Citibank and have a competitor, say BoA, buy the company whose product you just deployed?

7622073,comment,7620757,7621162,1,0,extra88,,,"Aereo is not just for watching live broadcasts. In fact, it&#x27;s somewhat annoying for that because as soon as one program ends, it kicks you back to the Guide and you have to select the next program to watch it. It&#x27;s really geared towards using it as a DVR in the cloud.<p>The DVR functionality is nice. Sure, assuming your antenna can pick up the OTA channels you want, you can build your own DVR but if you want it to be better than an old VHS recorder (simply setting channel start & stop days/times), you need a good source of TV schedule data which last I heard you have to pay for (not $8/month, but something). Aereo can be set to record only new episodes and has options to start a recording early and/or stop it late (especially helpful on Sundays when sports seem to regularly delay CBS programming).<p>I also pay $8/month for Hulu Plus and mostly watch that. I use Aereo (through a Roku3) to watch shows on channels that aren&#x27;t on Hulu (CGS, PBS) plus Saturday Night Live (because sometimes Hulu&#x27;s version is edited).<p>$8/month for Aereo a bit much for how I use it but it&#x27;s still cheaper than Comcast&#x27;s DVR set-top box. One could watch a lot more through Aereo, in the Boston area there ~25 channels available, but they&#x27;re pretty crappy.\n<a href=""https://aereo.com/channels"" rel=""nofollow"">https://aereo.com/channels</a>",1398099460

7622041,comment,7618406,7620958,2,0,CHY872,,,"What I&#x27;m personally hinting at is symbolic/concolic execution. Essentially, each variable has a set of constraints associated with it - initially left blank for an input variable, for example. Then, the program can be executed, with assignments producing new constraints and replacing old ones. At each point in control flow, the executor chooses a path, and adds new constraints. When a dangerous statement (assertion, pointer dereference etc) is reached, the constraints can be solved by z3 or some other SMT solver, and if it can find a satisfying result you automatically have a test case that will produce erroneous or undefined behaviour.<p>It works quite well for short programs, actually - the KLEE people (or maybe it was DART) found bugs in busybox, GNU Coreutils etc.<p>The current approach is to instead of traversing your control flow tree explicitly (which means you&#x27;re doing a tree search over a potentially infinite tree), converting the program such that it produces a logical statement that can be solved by an SMT solver, that is satisfiable iff there is an input that leads to a bug within that bounded number of loop unwindings.<p>With fun C++ metaprogramming, you can actually get this to happen natively (i.e. the parts that aren&#x27;t reliant on input get run natively) which leads to a massive speedup o<p>I don&#x27;t believe it to be model checking, although it might use model checking techniques.

Most of the team was building a windows client to interface with the camera and I was a one man army to handle the software onboard. I&#x27;d say that most software people don&#x27;t know what is hard with hardware (no pun intended, seriously).<p>Most of your time is spent around finding libraries that can be compiled for your board or fixing device drivers because of that slight board modification the hardware guys did. You also have to figure out how the proprietary hardware encoders work and make them work properly. If the documentation doesn&#x27;t fit the implementation? Well you have this contact under nda agreement that will eventually say &quot;I don&#x27;t know either, have you asked in the forums?&quot; after 2 weeks of back and forth. Also sometimes your device would just reboot and you&#x27;ll spend time arguing with the hardware guys that linux don&#x27;t just reboot for no reason. Did I mention having to worry about how your 64mb of ram get allocated and in which DSP pool?<p>Eventually, you&#x27;ll find time to write code that will cause your device to do something meaningful.<p>Writing software for hardware is much harder than it seems, because you have to worry about all those things you take for granted when working with a x86 desktop. You can&#x27;t upgrade often after shipping, so testing focuses on critical bugs instead of usability. I do agree than spending more resources would make sense, but consider this : Hiring a DSP specialist to get an H264 encoder to work would cost 80k$ in Montreal in 2007. This is something that is now free with newer chips, but just getting the hardware to work used to drain a lot of resources. Larger companies could have more money for that, but I do not know how they work internally so I can&#x27;t speak for them.",1398098164

7621877,comment,7620791,7621702,3,0,bane,,,"> Downvotes have been in Reddit&#x27;s DNA since the beginning. This is a reasonable stance.<p>No it&#x27;s not. There are plenty of subs that have lots of reason to not have downvotes (or any votes at all). It won&#x27;t affect much algorithm-wise because the post decay will eventually push things off the front page no matter what.<p>For example, there are entire groups of subs designed for self help, support group type activities that get overpowered by trolls downvoting everything and making it uncomfortable for people to even post in there. The only lever mods have is to take the sub private, but then they might<p>a) either exclude people who need the group<p>b) accidentally keep in one of the trolls<p>> Good advice! What else are they going to do? You can&#x27;t punish a crowd.<p>The same thing the admins do, find the brigade and ban them from the sub. Problem solved. But as a mod, you have zero ability to do this and are at the whim of the admin staff to do anything about it. Good luck running a sub when you have a troll downvoting every post to -6 right off the bat.<p>> A sub isn&#x27;t merely property of those who created it. It&#x27;s community property. Personally I think even being able to set a sub to &#x27;private&#x27; after it&#x27;s been created is too much, because it&#x27;s equivalent to a delete. People shouldn&#x27;t be able to delete the hard work of a community.<p>There are tons of subs that were literally the creation of one person, and have only ever had the one person in them. They were experimenting with something, or screwing around or whatever, and they should be able to take it down rather than have reddit aggregate it into overall promotional numbers &quot;look how popular reddit is! we have tens of thousands of subs!&quot;<p>> If Reddit were to show the actual number of upvotes per post, people might feel a little daunted. Right now people think a mere 2,000 upvotes are all that&#x27;s needed to get to the front page of a default sub, rather than the more realistic 80,000+. They may lose interest the same way most people aren&#x27;t interested in the presidential elections: they feel their vote doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>The fuzzing is fine at large numbers where small % up/down don&#x27;t really affect things much, but at small numbers it gets frequently weird when number are off by 10 or 20%. It&#x27;s even weirder when you just create a sub and suddenly you have ~6 users here now. It&#x27;s not the right way to deal with it and if they&#x27;re that inaccurate, just remove them entirely.<p>> AutoModerator seems pretty good for this, isn&#x27;t it?<p>It&#x27;s fine, but it should be part of the core mod tools. It&#x27;s beyond ridiculous that it required a flaky bot that you invite and add as a mod and configure through wiki pages to do the work the core code should be able to handle on it&#x27;s own.<p>> I don&#x27;t know why this story keeps floating in regards to /r/technology, but this isn&#x27;t it. Some moderator of /r/technology, when responding to censorship claims, responded roughly &quot;Reddit is a place for cat pictures and insulting people. Stop getting so worked up.&quot; They didn&#x27;t take their job seriously, and no one could do a thing about it. That&#x27;s what pissed people off, and it became pretty clear there was no accountability internal to their mod team.<p>Yeah, the flip side is when a mod, or mod group gets too controlling/lax, there&#x27;s really very little the user community can do about it. I bet that the only reason any action was taken at all was because the sub was default.",1398097624

7621814,comment,7620869,7620869,4,0,Theodores,,,"It is easy to mock the OTT solution that has gone on here, however...<p>I had the pleasure of working with a deaf guy that would spend an inordinate amount of time in the loo. There was just the one loo.<p>45 minutes could pass by with him occupying the loo. Being deaf it wasn&#x27;t as if you could knock on the door and ask him to hurry up - he would not be able to hear you, and, even if he could hear you he would be able to pretend otherwise. Like Schrodinger&#x27;s cat there would be no way of knowing...<p>You couldn&#x27;t complain either, for all one knew he might have been using that time for something more important than one&#x27;s own toiletry needs. Perhaps it was the batteries in his hearing aids, not being deaf one would not know, or even know if speculating about such a thing was morally inconsistent. Or maybe he had another medical condition that one was not privy too. Or maybe his body jewellery needed to have puss and inflammation cleaned out if it on a regular basis. One can only imagine...<p>It wasn&#x27;t as if he took the newspaper in or his phone, so it wasn&#x27;t a really good book or jolly exciting porn collection that took up his time there. None of the micro-managers really thought it a problem that he would spend such a long time in the loo, even if other staff and visitors had to go to a nearby Starbucks due to being caught short.<p>So we had a &#x27;is the toilet free&#x27; messaging system of our own. There would always be euphemisms, it wasn&#x27;t as if we would message &#x27;finally [x] has finished having a poo and you can now use the loo&#x27;. Anyone shoulder surfing our screens would not realise that that messaging conversation in the corner about &#x27;that report being delivered&#x27;, &#x27;the printer having finished&#x27;, &#x27;those files uploaded&#x27; or &#x27;desperate for that CSV file&#x27; was about the status of the loo. However, through such messages, those two floors away from the loo would be able to find out if it really would be possible for them to relieve themselves or not.<p>In our case, of a small team with inadequate toilet facilities, we really should have moved to a proper modern office with all of those Philips controls in the toilets to know what the occupancy situation is, whether the loo needs to be flushed, whether the water in the hand basin needed to flow and so on. But we were not going to do that. So we had our own system, a system that manager types were not privy to. It worked well for us and it was fun.<p>Had we gone a bit further, hooked up that free Raspberry Pi nobody knew what to do anything with and implemented something similar, I don&#x27;t know how it would have panned out. Someone other than the loo-hogger would have been sacked for wasting company time and not prioritising their work, the politics of disability would have got ugly and it would not have happened. So, even though the solution of the Raspberry Pi is OTT, in getting it done and having fun doing it, I think that this team have got something out of it a lot more valuable than their &#x27;Heath Robinson&#x27; toilet status indicator.<p>Personally I like the simple solution they have on older trains - a light that shows &#x27;vacant&#x27; or &#x27;occupied&#x27;. There is no internet to break down, there is no TCPIP settings to get wrong, just a lightbulb to change and a switch to keep clean.

Until now it took a backseat to over-shared content, when it should have been the other way round.<p>- This app could serve as the foundation for the next FaceBook. Once you strip down an app to its essentials, you can very carefully add features based on data and the lessons learned.<p>- We are moving towards more selective, opt-in types of engagement, as opposed to carpet bombing with the content feed. For example, there are only a couple of dozen people whose feeds I care about. Those are most likely the people who I interact with or message often.

7621779,comment,7618406,7621294,2,0,chriswarbo,,,"> Why not have a compiler that can take your specification and just write your program for you?<p>One difficulty with this is that programs (by definition) are &#x27;computationally relevant&#x27; whereas proofs are not. In other words, as long as we have a proof of X it doesn&#x27;t make a difference <i>which</i> proof we happen to have. On the other hand, different functions of type X can have a big impact on a program.<p>For starters, there are properties which are difficult to express using types. For example, we only have rudimentary ways to encode space and time usage (eg. &#x27;cost semantics&#x27;). Without this, when we ask for a sorting algorithm we may get back bubblesort, since it&#x27;s a perfectly acceptable implementation of a sorting algorithm.<p>Also, our types will have to become <i>incredibly</i> precise. Rather than just encoding the properties we care about (eg. security guarantees), we need to include lots of uninteresting properties to guide the computer to what we want (compare this to guiding a genetic algorithm via a fitness function, or getting a genie to grant you a wish in exactly the way you want). At this point, you&#x27;re basically writing your program in a very indirect way; you may be better off just writing one or two lines &#x27;manually&#x27; instead of trying to steer the automated process.",1398096691

Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m a doctor and I&#x27;ve created a revolutionary cure for the common cold. My cure is to shake a dried gourd over the cold sufferer until he gets better. The cure might take a week, but it always works. My method is repeatable and perfectly reliable, and I&#x27;ve published my cure in a refereed scientific journal (there are now any number of phony refereed scientific journals). And, because (in this thought experiment) science can get along without defining, falsifiable theories, I&#x27;m under no obligation to try to explain my cure, or consider alternative explanations for my breakthrough — I only have to describe it, just as the linked article describes the correlation between lead in gasoline and the crime rate.<p>Because I&#x27;ve cured the common cold, and because I&#x27;ve met all the requirements that social psychology recognizes for science, I deserve a Nobel Prize.

Sorry (you can hide the button via css, but people can still hotkey it)</i><p>Downvotes have been in Reddit&#x27;s DNA since the beginning.  This is a reasonable stance.<p><i>- Have a sockpuppet downvote brigade screwing up your sub? Message the reddit admins and hope they bother reading your message and doing anything about it. Because you have no idea who&#x27;s doing it and can&#x27;t really do anything about it. Current best advice is (this is not a joke) &quot;wait for them to get bored&quot;.</i><p>Good advice!  What else are they going to do?  You can&#x27;t punish a crowd.<p><i>- Somebody was granted admin access, kicked the rest of the mods off and has turned the sub to private (and the sub creator is incommunicado?) Tough luck.</i><p>Maybe a way to transfer sub ownership would be good.  Though if the creator decides they&#x27;re not interested in the sub they themselves created, maybe creating your own and sticking a redirect message on the frontpage is in order.<p><i>- Want to delete a sub I created? Too bad.</i><p>A sub isn&#x27;t merely property of those who created it.  It&#x27;s community property.  Personally I think even being able to set a sub to &#x27;private&#x27; after it&#x27;s been created is too much, because it&#x27;s equivalent to a delete.  People shouldn&#x27;t be able to delete the hard work of a community.<p><i>- Fuzzed numbers, votes, subscribers, current people on the sub, etc. Some mods don&#x27;t want it in their sub. Too bad.</i><p>If Reddit were to show the actual number of upvotes per post, people might feel a little daunted.  Right now people think a mere 2,000 upvotes are all that&#x27;s needed to get to the front page of a default sub, rather than the more realistic 80,000+.  They may lose interest the same way most people aren&#x27;t interested in the presidential elections: they feel their vote doesn&#x27;t matter.<p><i>- want to ban some URLs from your sub? try and use the spam filter, but good luck otherwise.</i><p>AutoModerator seems pretty good for this, isn&#x27;t it?<p><i>I think practically what the sub&#x27;s admins wanted to do was to just push down submissions on certain topics so a wider variety of things floated up, this happens on here all the time. But Reddit&#x27;s tool set to do the same is pretty ham fisted. It&#x27;s like changing the battery on a watch using a mallet.</i><p>I don&#x27;t know why this story keeps floating in regards to /r/technology, but this isn&#x27;t it.  Some moderator of /r/technology, when responding to censorship claims, responded roughly &quot;Reddit is a place for cat pictures and insulting people.  Stop getting so worked up.&quot;  They didn&#x27;t take their job seriously, and no one could do a thing about it.

It is entirely common for an entire day&#x27;s worth of fuel to be 1-3x the cost of the driver...especially so urban operations. Driving a minimal distance maximizes the driver&#x27;s productivity, true...but it also minimizes the distance traveled, which minimizes the fuel consumed and the associated maintenance (which hovers around 40% of fuel costs). What you are now proposing isn&#x27;t much better...instead of an autonomous vehicle running around catering to the scheduled whims of consumers, you have much more of them (which is a capital cost that scales linearly with peak usage during peak delivery times, while most sit idle for most of the day), running full round trips to a depot for every single delivery.<p>I&#x27;m all for creative solutions to problems. Your solutions just aren&#x27;t creative enough. Operations Research scientists have been working on this exact problem for well over four decades...UPS probably employs 1/3 of the logistics-specialized OR professionals in the entire world. Saying these solutions are simple, or just require a little bit more thought, is not much different from saying that proving P=NP is simple and requires just a little bit more thought.

The larger question is, what specifically do you wish to achieve?<p>Assuming you&#x27;re aiming for &quot;pretty productive and can get a well paid job with any of the languages you know&quot;, note that skill in programming is, but one dimension in the employability equation. A handful of others include: domain-specific knowledge (both technical, and those specific to the employer&#x27;s industry), communication skills, ability to juggle tasks, and ability to sell. Strength, or lack in any one, or combination of these skills can be an overriding factor in your pursuit.<p>You&#x27;ll often find on these boards, and in software circles people very noisy about language of choice. This has historical, sunken-cost-fallacy, and mid-carrier-crisis backgrounds; none of which are particularly productive to your goal. You&#x27;ll also find many posts claiming shiny features achieved in one particular language. This has marketing background, and is also not conductive to employment.<p>In conclusion, given your stated goals, your question is a red herring -it serves to distract you from what you&#x27;re trying to achieve. It is possible to be very good in multiple languages. You might even aspire, and reach this goal within 3-5 years.

6892976,comment,6885448,6887854,2,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> For lots of us using basic CDN services, we enable referrer checks to ensure that folks aren&#x27;t hotlinking images or direct linking downloads from other sites.<p>This is actually an interesting problem, because it&#x27;s already solved but most people aren&#x27;t using the solution: If you have a large file do distribute to a large number of people without authentication, use BitTorrent. As far as I can see there are two primary impediments to this:<p>A) Most browsers can&#x27;t by default download large files P2P. You can actually write a BitTorrent client in javascript using Web Sockets if you really want to, but that&#x27;s just horrible. What would be really nice is to be able to just e.g. embed a video into a webpage using a magnet link. There is no technical reason why this couldn&#x27;t be implemented and rightly should be for large files.<p>B) Images are exactly the wrong size. They&#x27;re big enough that you can&#x27;t just ignore hotlinking but not big enough that you want to pay the overhead of connecting to 50 different peers instead of one to get a good transfer rate. But that just requires some adjustments to the protocol; if you&#x27;re looking for realtime retrieval for display in a webpage you would probably want to use UDP and then use erasure coding to deal with slow/broken peers and packet loss. If you have a 60KB image, you can send a ~50 byte packet to each of a dozen peers and have ten of them each send 6KB (approximately four packets) to the target with 6KB worth of erasure bits from each of the others (which also allows the image to be constructed once 60KB of data is received in total from any collection of peers), and now the image is costing you ~600 bytes instead of 60KB. And if the image hasn&#x27;t been received in 150ms, add more peers.",1386826811

Yes, drunken driving that results in the deaths of pedestrians is usually a criminal offense, all over the world. However, in many places, and for sure in every state of the United States, a minor who commits a criminal act will not be put on trial in the adult court system, but rather in a special juvenile court with different rules and different outcomes for a case. The usual outcome of a juvenile court case is court supervision to try to help the juvenile grow up to be an adult who won&#x27;t commit crimes. That is the disposition that was ordered in this case.<p>Because of the severity of the charged offense, the prosecutors in this case asked for, and apparently were within the scope of juvenile court rules to ask for, hard prison time if the juvenile defendant was found delinquent. But, yes, in this case the defense lawyers, who were no doubt expensive specialist defense lawyers, came up with a defense that convinced the judge to order a less harsh disposition for the case. A news report I saw[1] included this report about what a defense lawyer said after the case decision:<p>&quot;&#x27;There is nothing the judge could have done to lessen the suffering for any of those families,&#x27; said defense attorney Scott Brown, CNN affiliate KTVT reported.<p>&#x27;(The judge) fashioned a sentence that is going to keep Ethan under the thumb of the justice system for the next 10 years,&#x27; he said. &#x27;And if Ethan doesn&#x27;t do what he&#x27;s supposed to do, if he has one misstep at all, then this judge, or an adult judge when he&#x27;s transferred, can then incarcerate him.&#x27;&quot;<p>So it could be that the boy will still do prison time (which I personally think would be more just than the treatment disposition he has received so far). Some of the facts in another report about the case[2] are really stark. This boy was a disaster waiting to happen in his earlier behavior, and his parents appeared not to do much about that. That&#x27;s just wrong. But the prosecutors had their one chance at trial to ask for a tougher sentence on the boy, and the trial court decision now cannot be undone to allow them to ask for a second trial to get tougher punishment. Nor can the parents be tried for anything under usual principles of United States law in this case.<p>[1] <a href=""http://edition.cnn.com/2013/12/11/us/texas-teen-dwi-wreck/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edition.cnn.com/2013/12/11/us/texas-teen-dwi-wreck/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.wfaa.com/news/crime/Defense-pushes-for-intensive-therapy-for-teen-in-drunken-crash-that-killed-4-235288101.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wfaa.com/news/crime/Defense-pushes-for-intensive-...</a>",1386824652

For super-serious something or other I hear Excel is unbeatable, but I don&#x27;t know what functions Excel has that google doesn&#x27;t, let alone Numbers, and Numbers has the one feature <i>every</i> spreadsheet should have and almost none do (certainly not excel/google): allow two sheets on a single page. How often do you have to juggle column widths/cell merges to get different layouts in two parts of your worksheet? No more! With Numbers you can draw out multiple separate sheets, each with their own column widths/row heights and other formatting, no problem.<p>And for large data sets, or data that requires extensive filtering or specialized presentation, FileMaker, no question. It blows all spreadsheets away when it comes to: hundreds of thousands of rows (or millions), and it supports limitless separate views of the same data. Anyone who does serious work in excel that includes large data, normalize-able data, or extensive presentation or filtering, you owe it to yourself to check out FileMaker.",1386824461
6892885,comment,6889204,6889204,1,0,javajosh,,,"I&#x27;m not sure if this is the first science fiction story to tell of a lone biologist creating a plague, but Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;The White Plague&quot;[1] was written in 1982 and presages a time (in 1996 no less) that a single actor, motivated by personal tragedy, could create and release such a thing.<p>In a sense though, this notion that technology can give individuals unimaginable power has also been a theme with Robert Heinlein (I think), where he wrote about an easy-to-manufacture superweapon which basically gave anyone the ability to destroy the world. It was also a theme in Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s &quot;Cat Cradle&quot; although that&#x27;s a little bit more of a stretch.<p>It&#x27;s true that our destructive capability scales with the amount of energy that we can harness. And it&#x27;s also true that biological threats are under-perceived. But it seems to be that biology is inherently messy to avoid being too susceptible to annhiliation. That is, yes, it may be possible to create a plague that wipes out 50% of humans - but in the scheme of things, that&#x27;s not the end of the world. Certainly not the end of humans (not even close!). And it seems that the likelihood of creating such a pathogen is exceedingly small. Indeed, I&#x27;d estimate that you couldn&#x27;t kill more than 10% of people with a single plague.<p>But since we&#x27;re talking about catastrophe, it&#x27;s interesting to wonder about whether a single human could end the world, and if so how. The most likely way (and rather dramatic way) would be to maneuver a large asteroid to impact the Earth. Energetically, it&#x27;s entirely possible to do. As for nuclear war, I&#x27;m not entirely convinced that would really be the end for humans - although it&#x27;s certainly possible. Another way to end the world <i>might</i> be to release mega-tons of CFCs into the upper atmosphere, intentionally destroying the ozone layer. I can&#x27;t think of any other scenarios!<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Plague"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Plague</a>",1386824455

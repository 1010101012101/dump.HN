My laptop is primarily mobile -- I take it to work, work from coffee shops, the couch, etc., but when I want to do something that I need need more of a desktop setting for (I can't do image editing on the couch, or without a mouse, or without a large screen usually) I just plug the laptop into the docking station.<p>The docking station is connected to an external hard drive for backups, speakers for sound, external monitor, keyboard, mouse, power cable, Line 6 Pod XT guitar pedal and mixing board.<p>It allows me the flexibility of having a convenient desktop setup while still maintaining the portability I bought a laptop for.  I'm surprised more people don't use it, as it seems like the edge case here instead of the norm.",1251831566

It takes a lot of work and a lot of expertise to put together a home-grown system that works as well as one from the major vendors. If you're only going to be using one or two, you're much better off going to one of those major vendors because a large part of the price is their expertise and testing that went into it.  For a large setup like Backblaze they can spread the cost of design over many systems, but for smaller companies it just isn't feasible.<p>We hacker types love to think that we could do the same thing in no time with little budget, and I'm sure we could get a first approximation.  But the devil is in the details.  Debugging the complex interaction of 20 different hardware components is not my idea of fun.<p>Hats off to them, particularly for sharing.",1251831562

(You can tell without reading it all because he links to Joel's retarded article about ""leaky abstractions"".)<p>But, object databases are a great idea for many applications.  With KiokuDB (a Perl object database), you can even serialize closures.  That means, for example, if you have a stateful web app, and one server crashes between requests, any other server can handle the request just fine; without any state loss, and without rewriting your closure-based app in terms of classes.

I think the reason that most people look at Linux and compare it to Windows is because most people start on Windows, so it's what they're used to.<p>I live on Linux for the most part, so I've gotten used to things, but there are still some things that need some work, especially when it comes to laptops: namely, dealing with resolution issues, external screens, and power management.  Most of these things can be dealt with if you're comfortable in Linux, but this stuff is REALLY easy to do on Windows (most likely because the driver support is better there, and will continue to be as long as Windows is the dominant user platform).<p>Anyway, I think Ubuntu has come a long way, and I'm perfectly happy running it as my main OS, but I can see what the author is saying here.",1251828962

And, as you already noticed this is pretty inefficient.<p>If you use server-push, which is technically possible - and which I've been using in some form or other since the mid 90's to stream 'video' (read a sequence of still images) - the upper limit is usually how many concurrent connections your server architecture can handle.<p>For a single machine with a single IP that upper limit is about 60,000 connections, a multi-homed machine can do a multiple of that by binding to more than one IP address. The reason for this is that every connection requires a socket which maps to a port and the TCP field for a port number is only 16 bits.<p>By using a poll system the overall latency goes up but you can handle many more concurrent users with the same machine.",1251828894

That totally make sense for Backblaze. However it's important to not compare this like for like with something like S3 which is optimized for much better read/write performance.<p>At the basic level the cooling on this system seems minimal. Those tightly packed drives would sure get hot if they were all spinning a lot. More than that since they are using commodity consumer hardware, and they already used up their PCIe slots for the SATA controllers there isn't any place to add anything more than the gitabit (I assume) ethernet jack on the mobo. That means there throughput is limited.<p>Again, this is a great system for backup. Most of the data will just sit happily sipping little power.

That's real time, versus something like a blog (except a live blog of course) where the information is not time sensitive or about something that happened that second.<p>Pages like Twitter or Gmail use AJAX to retrieve new information from a server without refreshing your whole page. Twitter does do this (or did, at least when viewing search results and it would tell you how many new results there have been since the last page refresh).

The truth is that Microsoft doesn't make this stuff work, HP and Dell do.  They're the ones who get the support calls when stuff fails, so they're the ones with an incentive to make the integration work right.

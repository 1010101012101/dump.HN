8110901,comment,8108064,8110040,4,0,thinkharder,,,"As someone who has had, what sounds like a very similar experience to yours, I understand and feel your pain.  Folks who have never had to deal with it think it&#x27;s as simple as going to the doctor.  Folks who live in SV tend to forget that in the vast majority of the rest of this country, good mental health help is really hard to get.  Outside of the major US cities, your typical family doctor has about the same level of understanding of mental health issues as he has about quantum physics, but he thinks he knows everything he needs to about it.  And the vast majority of Mental Healthcare professionals require a referral from your PCP or they won&#x27;t take you as a patient.  The scenario typically goes like this:  I go see my Primary Care Physician and complain about depression or some other mental health issue.  He listens for a couple of minutes then wants to prescribe zoloft (or celexa or whatever).  I ask about seeing a Psychiatrist and get something like &quot;well, he&#x27;s just going to have his intern ask you a bunch of questions then prescribe the same drug I would...&quot;   I ask about seeing a Psychologist, and after some pushing he grudgingly gives me a referral.  The psychologist is a really bad fit with me, and isn&#x27;t helping so now I&#x27;ve got a open-ended prescription for zoloft and no fucking help.    Been thru slight variations of the same theme with 3 different primary care doctors.  And no, I don&#x27;t really think any of them believed I actually had a problem, but they&#x27;ll give endless supplies of zoloft et al., to anyone, for any reason.  And they&#x27;ll happily prescribe it for you forever, without also setting you up with some form of counseling, which is specifically warned against in the drug literature.<p>What I finally had to do, was talk to a close friend who knows a lot of Mental Health practitioners, partly from using their services, partly from the fact this guy knows everyone in town.  He was able to call a friend who is a retired Psychiatrist, who was able to help find someone who would take me without a referral, and further refer me to a good psychologist.  There&#x27;s also the issue that most insurance plans have pretty crappy coverage for this stuff.  And since I can&#x27;t get an in-network referral to an in-network doctor, I&#x27;ll be paying for most of this out of pocket.<p>My advice, for the little it&#x27;s worth, is first... Don&#x27;t Give Up.  It&#x27;s a fucking absurd pain in the ass, but it is possible to overcome.  Think about finding a doctor the same way you would about hiring an employee, that&#x27;s basically what you&#x27;re doing.  Use your social network, do you know anyone who is in a high-risk group for depression or other mental health issues?  It&#x27;s likely you know someone who has struggled with this and just never said anything.   Ask around.  It sucks to have to reveal yourself that way, but it&#x27;s really not as bad as it seems in one&#x27;s imagination.  You will probably be surprised how many people not only get it, but want to help.   Try a doctor out, if he isn&#x27;t working, fire his ass and get another.  No different than hiring a contractor.  It&#x27;s easy to load a lot of emotion into the process, but avoid doing this and stick to business.  And try not to get sucked into the psychiatry vs psychology wanking contest.  They&#x27;re different approaches, have different tools, and different efficacies for different issues.  CBT is great for moderate depression.  There&#x27;s much less evidence it&#x27;s helpful for ADHD.  There&#x27;s a whole class of medication that&#x27;s quite effective for ADHD.   There&#x27;s much less evidence that zoloft and friends are useful long term for depression.  Extrapolate that out for all the other possible mental health issue a person might have.<p>At any rate, you&#x27;re not alone, my friend, and you&#x27;re not the only one who has had to go thru this shit.  It is possible...   Email is in my profile, if you need someone to talk to, feel free to contact me.  Best of luck.",1406753886

I know many such people, and many have asked me &quot;The term API predates the web; In what sense is this an API?&quot;.<p>For such people, I propose the metaphor that HTTP APIs are a form run-time linking where the root URL (api.example.com) is the &quot;library&quot; and the valid URIs (api.example.com/list_of_cats) are the exported &quot;symbols&quot; you can reference from your program.

When I last owned a room, I painted it orange, because I was the only one that had any say in the matter, and I wanted orange.<p>Now, all my rooms are white.<p>And almost all of my furniture is crappy, flat-pack, self-assembly particle-board dreck.  That&#x27;s because my preference for durable, quality furniture is overridden by my ever-declining wage relative to my expenses, and my need to move around frequently in search of jobs that allow me to tread water a bit longer at my current standard of living.<p>I want a nice chair, but I also want something to sit on until I can afford one.  It always seems that the price of a chair I could keep until the day I die increases faster than my ability to pay for one.

No!<p>- The reason is payment processing does not generate much cash! Certainly nothing that can support a 60 person team that bitpay has.<p>- There is very little bitcoin payment volume and not expected to be much in the near future. Honestly, despite how much press coverage it gets whenever a merchant accepts bitcoin. No one is doing big volume through bitcoin. \nCertainly not at a volume that is meaningful to a processor.<p>- Bitpay says they processed 100m in transaction last year. That is false. Bitcoin price was around $100 most of the year. And in December it went to $1000/btc. And so they took $1000 and applied that to all the sales throughout the entire year<p>- They recently have a massive change in strategy when Tony Gallipi stepped down as the CEO and Stephen Pair became the CEO (original CTO). This is important, because since then the strategy became open source focused (very much like Redhat for bitcoin)<p>2. Bitcoin payment processing has incredibly low barrier to entry.<p>- Unlike visa and mastercard which has massive barrier to entry. Vanilla Bitcoin payment processing really just involves less than 100 lines of code. Like<p>Step 1: Use BIP32 to safely and securely accept payments (Keep the private key offline and derive addresses using the master public key on the server).<p>Step 2: Write a little script to run locally to hook up to a API to sell the bitcoin. Voila, you have basically got bitpay.<p>Like many other internet based service, the fees eventually trends towards 0. Unfortunately, monetization of bitcoin payments is going to look very different than the traditional visa/mastercard/paypal model and it cannot come from vanilla fees alone.<p>Because what used to be proprietary network/technologies has been mostly replaced by the bitcoin protocol itself.

Empirically (via youtube), there is a strong connection between &quot;HHO&quot; promoters and &quot;water-fueled car&quot; and &quot;over-unity generator&quot; fraudsters. Oxyhydrogen torches are pretty awesome - I&#x27;ve used both a small electrolysis unit for jewelry work, and a larger tank-fed torch for working with fused quartz. Amazingly clean and hot flame, with definite niche-applications. However, oxyhydrogen combustion (electrolysis-derived, or otherwise) isn&#x27;t exactly a revolutionary technology. We&#x27;ve made industrial use of it since the 1860s [1], and the trend has been gradual replacement by other fuels and techniques (TIG, electric arc furnaces, etc) that are more controllable and lack H2&#x27;s unique shortcomings - eg. hydrogen embrittlement, massive range of explosive concentrations, and incredible ability to diffuse through things.<p>[1] Faraday&#x27;s 1861 lecture on platinum-group metals is a great example. Small-scale platinum casting is one of the big uses for oxyhydrogen - the combination of a high melting point and severe carbon embrittlement make H2 ideal for working with platinum.",1406752733

Extreme endurance athletes are using ketogenic diets as a tool to smash records in ultramarathon running[2].<p>Nobody <i>needs</i> carbohydrate. That doesn&#x27;t mean carbs are necessarily bad, but the long-time trope that you have to have them if you want to move further than your couch is just silly and has long been disproven (if, by nobody else, hunter-gatherers who had gone days without food while running down a kill).<p>Phinney and Volek have found interesting things about fat and high-intensity exercise:<p>* Fat utilization in keto-adapted individuals that is, literally, re-writing textbooks. Levels of fat mobilization that have never been seen in laboratories is being recorded. This likely has a genetic component, what I would consider the opposite of the multiple copies of the amylase gene that highly carb-tolerant people seem to have.<p>* Fat requires less oxygen to utilize, leading to less lactic acid, less muscle tissue damage, and faster recovery.<p>* Keto-adapted athletes are much more efficient in their use of their glycogen stores, using less when passing 70% VO2-max and replenishing supplies faster. They do not store as much glycogen as carb-burners, so the net effect winds up being about the same amount of power from glycogen between carb and fat burners.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean there are no athletes who would see benefits of carbs, but, in a fat-adapted state, those carbs can be much, much more strategic in nature (the cyclist sprinting over the hill, the olympic lifter in competition, etc). Peter Attia talks a lot about his strategic use of carbs while exercising[3].<p>Personally, I see beans as a food to be very cautious with. The phytates, lectins, and saponins in them are there to protect the seed, since plants can&#x27;t run away to protect their offspring. They use chemical warfare, and are quite good at it, leading to poor absorption of nutrients[4]. Properly preparing them (soaking and fermenting) can address this problem, something done in all societies previous to the 20th century, but rarely done now.<p>I also can&#x27;t see any reason to use low fat, well, anything. Fat is a perfectly healthy macronutrient, and, when going for low fat, you are typically getting a lot of sugar and additives put in to replace the taste and texture of the lost fat. On the other hand, live-cultured dairy products, for those who can tolerate lactose, are an amazing food.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.artandscienceoflowcarb.com/the-art-and-science-of-low-carbohydrate-performance/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artandscienceoflowcarb.com/the-art-and-science-of...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.meandmydiabetes.com/2012/08/11/western-states-100-low-carber-wins-ultramarathon-steve-phinney-and-jeff-volek-study/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.meandmydiabetes.com/2012/08/11/western-states-100...</a><p>3. <a href=""http://eatingacademy.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eatingacademy.com</a><p>4. <a href=""http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/49/1/140.short"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/49/1/140.short</a>",1406752606

They have had one of these systems there for several years now, so one of my main tasks was to present data displayed on the sphere and offer explanations/answer questions. The system we had used about 4 projectors with the sphere, with images synced to make the projections aligned. The set up we had wasn&#x27;t perfect (it didn&#x27;t completely cover the bottom pole). However, we had a couple of Wii controllers set up to allow rotation, panning, and timescaling of the projected images, to make up for this. On the whole we had a lot of cool animations to show the visitors and it was really enjoyable showing that data. The biggest problem was getting  (younger) visitors to not try to constantly touch the sphere.<p>My understanding is that this system has become very common for museums showing space or earth science content. It is a neat format to use, and individual museums can set up their own controls for setting up individual animations, creating playlists, and setting up controls for manually operating the system if they use it in shows or presentations, etc. If you have your own data you can put in up on the SOS; we were always looking for the cool things that noaa and sometimes other museums would put up.",1406751995

And all the desktop OSes as well.<p>Also, mobile is the perfect direction for a perceived &quot;top heavy&quot; desktop to move towards, because it requires you to simplify your UI to accommodate it.<p>The thing in the KDE world to understand is that QML changes everything. The Plasma widgets we have <i>now</i> were built on top of Qt4 series technologies and were often language hodge podges of Python, Ruby, Perl, C++, etc. They weren&#x27;t hardware accelerated, and the standard toolkit was lacking compared to the QtQuick Controls of today.<p>And the entire QML thing is about fluidity. Whereas old Qt Widgets let you build wildly complex UIs that were pretty much static, QML is best suited to simple parts doing crazy transitions and fancy effects. Even if you convey the same complexity, the appearance difference can be enough to be intuitive for some where, say, kdenlive is not.<p>So I don&#x27;t think Plasma Active is a &quot;mistake&quot;. It is a great place to see the next geenration of applications for KDE in general come from, since they have to be focused. It is slow, and it is not going to see any market adoption any time soon, but trying to aggressively take the mobile market I feel is a mistake right now - it needs mindshare that requires Qt5 adoption which requires the KDE5 series to get into its stride first.",1406751111

Why build a house out of brick or stone when timber is completely sufficient, and the latter is much, much cheaper to come by? It&#x27;s not like timber just magically stops working one day - there are plenty of houses in older parts of the US that are 100+ years old. Any argument along the lines of &quot;they don&#x27;t build them like they used to&quot; is likely ignoring survivorship bias among older homes.<p>And for the record, ceilings over 8FT are not a luxury item in the US.

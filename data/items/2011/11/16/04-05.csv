In your case, you like the projects and your coworkers, but are they work $20k per year?  Or are you willing to take a chance that the new place will suck in exchange for $20k more?  If I were you (and I was in this exact position a year ago), I would go for the title and the money now, because your current salary tends to dictate the next. Even if you don't like the new place, if you tough it out for a year, you can find something else and start the salary discussions at $95k+ instead of $77k+.  And who knows, you may even like the new place more than the current one on top of the higher salary. Whatever you do, don't be tempted to ask your company for another counteroffer.  You can only play that card once.",1321419548

However, no information was ever actually relayed to the congressmen. We had a formatted response to each and every issue that the House could possibly vote on. Everything from internet poker, to any issue you could imagine. We would print out (and alter if necessary) the response to tailor it to the individual that called, emailed, or wrote a physical letter. The congressman's signature was stamped at the bottom of the letter and sent back to the constituent, giving the allusion of due diligence on the congressman's part.<p>I was extremely surprised and disappointed at the same time at how commonplace this was. Pretty much every intern I asked about it went through the same drill. It's just another thing about our government and ""representative democracy"" that really irked me. So whenever I see ads urging people to call or write their congressman, I think back to this and realize further how powerless we really are.<p>The best way to exert influence over your congressman is to donate lots of money and become a memorable name that can get in contact with the actual representative him/herself.

3241788,comment,3241164,3241650,4,0,antoncohen,,,"I knew someone would mention Deus Ex. I tried it, granted I probably didn't give it a fair shot, but what I did play of it I didn't like. Actually it was probably worse. I don't like RPGs, I find them even more contrived and tedious than SP FPSs.<p>I don't want to have to collect things to move on. I don't want to solve puzzles. I don't want skill points that make me better at shooting a rifle. What makes me better at shooting a rifle in a game is what makes me better in real life -- practice. When I started playing AA3 I sucked, I couldn't control my weapon, but with practice I got better. When I used to play SoF2 I would load a map locally and practice shooting walls for hours. Learning to shoot a perfect two shot burst at head level. People would think I was cheating because I could take their heads off before they even fired a shot. And it wasn't because of artificial skill points, it was because I practiced.<p>To me multiplayer FPSs are like competitive sports. They take practice, they are intense and thrilling, they require team tactics, there is competition against real people, and there is the thrill of victory from beating a real person. I don't want to out-smart code a developer wrote, or out-shoot an AI programmed to be less accurate than a computer should be. I want to out-smart a person who is trying to out-smart me. I want to out-shoot a person who is trying their best to out-shoot me.<p>I hope companies continue to make good SP FPS and RPG games, because I know people that really like them. They just don't do it for me.",1321418120

This company is a fairly popular financial website that most people have heard of.  I was hired at $58k.  I mostly do the more advanced JavaScript development for my current company which makes my skills somewhat unique around here.<p>About 7 months ago another company expressed interest in me and made me an offer.  My current employer made a counter offer ($77k with a $4k 1year retention bonus) and even though I know most people say don't take the counter-offer, I took it.  I liked my current position and the people I work with and I got the vibe that they really didn't want to lose me.<p>Now, again - a company has expressed interest in me.  They have some jQuery/Backbone/Node.js work and made a generous offer of $95k. This new company is smaller than my current company and the site I would be working on would be behind a wall with a much smaller user base.<p>I need help deciding if I should take this new offer.<p>Pros (for taking the new offer):  \n* $18-20k salary increase  \n* Work from home 2 days a week  \n* Somewhat flexible working hours  \n* Would be entering at a ""Senior"" level title.<p>Cons:  \n* I like my current co-workers, boss.  \n* I like my current work/high profile projects I'm on.  \n* Would have to break retention bonus (pay back $4k)  \n* I would have to wear business casual (I know this shouldn't be a big deal, but I really enjoy the casual dress of my current employer.  Almost irrationally so.)  \n* The new office looks slightly drab, the cubes aren't as nice as my current place.    \n* The new offices programmers seem a good bit older than me.  Might not be a big deal but I'm used to a bunch of young devs my age.<p>Part of me doesn't want to upset people at my current place and I do enjoy my current work I do.  Another part of me thinks I would be crazy to turn down such a salary so early in my career.   No matter what I choose, I do plan on moving to the coast in ~2 years when my wife graduates from her masters program.<p>Can anyone who has been down this path give me some general advice?",1321417558

3241759,comment,3241164,3241164,1,0,avolcano,,,"A handful of games to consider, if you're waiting out this FPS drought:<p>- Raven Software's recent releases, Wolfenstein and Singularity (360, PS3, and PC). While both have similar core gunplay to most modern FPS's - iron sights, etc. - they offer unique enemies and a lot of neat gimmicks and twists. I haven't played Wolfenstein, but I know Singularity has stuff like weapon upgrades, various powers, etc.<p>- Painkiller (PC) is very much a descendant of the original Quake, with a similarly gritty medieval atmosphere, and a similarly brown color palette. It's not a pretty game to look at, but it's pretty fun. Personally was a bit too repetitive for me. Stay away from its sequels and expansions at all costs, though.<p>- Serious Sam HD (PC, 360) is tons of fun and hard as hell, with massive amounts of enemies in every level and a lot of massive, beautiful, and most of all colorful arenas. While The First Encounter and The Second Encounter originally came out on PC and Xbox 1, you should check out the recent HD remakes (on Steam and on Xbox Live Arcade) instead. And stay away from Serious Sam 2 (not to be confused with The Second Encounter) at all costs; it's not a good game. On the other hand, Serious Sam 3 comes out next week and seems promising.<p>- Hard Reset (PC) is a recent indie FPS that has gunplay similar to Painkiller and Serious Sam, but with an ultra-cool cyberpunk aesthetic. It also has more depth, with there being two weapons that can be upgraded in a variety of ways. However, it's somewhat short and has no multiplayer component (though they recently added a solo survival mode), so even though it's only $30, you may want to wait for it to be on sale. There's a demo available on Steam.",1321417327

In particular, the shuffling model gives reasonably high probability to ""imperfect"" riffle shuffles that take several cards from the left pile and then several cards from the right pile.<p>This model is on the first page of the paper<p><a href=""http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?view=body&id=pdf_1&handle=euclid.aoap/1177005705"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?vi...</a><p>Basically, you split the cards at random, and then you draw sequentially at random from the two piles with probability L/(L+R) versus R/(L+R) (where L is the number of cards remaining in the left pile), to assemble the new deck.  This will allow shuffle sequences that take a run from the left and then a run from the right.<p>As people above have noted, of course the ""randomization"" of the deck is not perfect after 7 shuffles.  But for lots of Markov processes, including this one, the distance of the shuffled deck to the uniform distribution on all decks tends to zero exponentially fast.  So you get a quick change-over from ""not random at all"" to ""very random"".  See table 3 of the paper.<p>Persi Diaconis (<a href=""http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~cgates/PERSI/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~cgates/PERSI/</a>), to whom this result is partly due, is a legend in mathematical probability.

Merchants pay between 2-4% in fees for every transaction<p>Many people seem to forget about the second - <i>""I'm not paying any fees""</i> :/.<p>That means around $40 billion in fees per year.

It was an older place, of course, and looked very suburban.   I think it was closer to $350 than $300 but I'm certain it wasn't above $350 (We didn't look at anything that had an asking price higher than $350)<p>It wasn't big;  just under a thousand squarefeet, if I remember right, not counting the garage or the shed.  3bdr, 2 bathrooms;  one of the bathrooms was an un-permitted conversion of a closet.   (oh man.  so many houses in this area have been badly converted to hold more people than was originally intended.)<p>The roof was in fairly okay shape;  it seemed structurally pretty good.  It badly needed new carpet, appliances and paint inside and out.<p>When was last time you looked?   Things are bad right now, I mean, if you are trying to sell;  I looked at rather a large number of houses over a period of a few months (we stopped looking, oh, two or three months ago)  nearly all the properties we looked at were either short-sales or bank owned.  Most of the places we looked at?  last sold for close to 2x the current asking price.<p>But yeah, there seemed to be plenty of livable stuff in the Sunnyvale area for under $350K, and it gets cheaper as you get closer to San Jose.<p>This wasn't the cheapest thing we looked at, but most of the cheaper single family homes had more significant problems like a roof that should have been replaced five years ago.<p>There was a very small 2 bedroom house on America over near arques and central expressway in sunnyvale.   Well under $250 if I remember right, but it needed way more work than I wanted to put in.  (incidentally, it also had a poorly-done bathroom addition;  this one opening to outside. at least it was enclosed.)<p>I could go on for hours about all the poorly-done bathroom additions we saw.   At one house, someone just took a toilet and plumbed it in to the corner of their enclosed back patio.    They also had a completely free-standing shower insert plumbed in to the same area.<p>but yeah; in that price range you see a lot of stuff that needs a whole lot of work, but you will also find a few places that are livable with new carpets.",1321416592

So keep it in mind and don&#x27;t make so many simultaneous data bindings. Why you would need 2000+ in any given state(ui-router)/route is just mystifying. Don&#x27;t abuse ng-model.</i><p>As someone who&#x27;s going to need to make a recommendation soon about whether or not to use Angular on a new project, this part worries me. The apps my company builds are full of data grids (Enterprise CRUD-based stuff) and it&#x27;s entirely reasonable for us to have a 100-row grid with 20 columns as just <i>one</i> of the components on our page. So that&#x27;s 2000 data bindings right there just for the data values. We&#x27;d also have metadata on every cell bound to classes and validation state. If we allow in-place editing, a single one of those fields can be updated. We can&#x27;t have the entire grid re-checked after every update if that&#x27;s going to hit the limit on acceptable performance. We&#x27;d need to limit it to the row (eg: cross-field validation rules) and elements outside the grid (eg: change toolbar button states.)<p>Does Angular 2 have similar limitations?

Most of these issues are gotchas that can easily be avoided once the developer is aware of them (such as scope inheritance / dynamic scope which is due to Javascript Prototypal Inheritance [1]).<p>What&#x27;s ironic is that angular 2 is fully rewritten in part to fix all of these issues, but none of that is mentioned, and the only focus is on how much Angular 2 sucks because it&#x27;s not compatible with 1. There is also no mention of clear migration path and ability to run angular 1 and 2 side by side [2]<p>I&#x27;ve put 4 Angular sites in production and never faced issues due to any of these problems. I&#x27;ve had issues with caching, end to end testing of ajax calls, sharing functionality with non angular parts of the site.

I can answer this - without a user profile, best case scenario is that you&#x27;re shown something at random, with a disastrous conversion rate. And worst case scenario is ads being used for spreading pieces of propaganda on controversial issues and I remember for example how a certain gold mining company was attempting to manipulate with downright lies the viewers of certain YouTube videos that were criticizing their open-pit project. And because such ad spots are basically worthless, they can be bought for cheap.<p>I&#x27;m personally all about privacy and the security of my data, being downright paranoid. But privacy is one thing, blocking ads is another. If you don&#x27;t like ads, then don&#x27;t use those services or websites. That&#x27;s how you end up rewarding alternatives and personally I rewarded many alternatives that way. Even if you want to <i>punish</i> bad actors, you still give them the eyeballs, you still distribute those links to your friends, etc. The concept of voting with your wallet is basically broken.<p>And contrary to the music and film industry that has pushed for DRM, this time people that block ads don&#x27;t have the proper moral ground to stand on and also the industry is not going to go down without a fight. Consider that you can&#x27;t block ads in mobile apps without having root privileges. This will turn out to be a whack-a-mole game and it won&#x27;t last for long. Just wait until these websites will start to serve ads from their own domain, with ads being indistinguishable from the surrounding content ... oh wait, this is already happening ;-)<p>Worst of all is that you end up hurting other people - from publishers, many of whom are already on the verge of bankruptcy, to people that will suffer the consequences even if they don&#x27;t use ad-blockers, as the history of video gaming can teach us.

I don&#x27;t want to write an event listener for every onclick, onchange, and onkeypress. I want the values in my models and the values in the DOM to be in sync. I like using nearly straight up HTML as my template. I do this in Django, so why not in Angular? I like that I don&#x27;t need to render things server-side because then the server is just running a REST-ful API. That way I can write different clients for the API and don&#x27;t have to change the server (mobile app, desktop UI, etc.) I like the clean separation between presentation (HTML templates), UI logic (controllers), and communication (services).<p>I feel like Angular&#x27;s biggest problem is the documentation. It starts out talking about things like dependency injection and why that&#x27;s good, instead of simply displaying how to use the framework. It&#x27;s got a steep learning curve and it just seems that people get scared of the documentation and run away before they really give it a try.",1443013696

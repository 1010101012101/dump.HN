Do you know what info was in the book and what impact it would have or not have on national security issues? It sounds like what happened was that he put information in the book that could be considered classified or at least sensitive, the Army Reserve Command approved it, but then after publication, other branches of the government saw things they would not have approved. My guess is that pressing charges would be difficult, since he got approval prior to publication, but that doesn't mean that no classified info slipped through.<p>Again, my point is not at all that this situation was handled well, just that the point that withholding the truth from the public isn't necessarily the terrible injustice that it sounds like.",1285516766

If you were able to get a job doing web development, then that would be the best way to get started.  That way you can learn from the others you are working with, get more experience as a professional web developer and see how web development works as a business.<p>Also, I'm not sure I would want to be doing freelance web development while in high school.  I assume you are living with your parents and everything is paid for.  This would be a good time to to continue improving on your skills, setup a home for your future business, establish your networks and possibly put some work in the open source world.  Soon enough you will have real bills and much less time to do things like this, so take advantage of the opportunity while it's there.<p>I'm also not sure I would want to be doing freelance web development while in college.  Again, this is a business.  Essentially you are creating your own startup.  Freelance work can be stressful and difficult to manage for a full timer with experience, let alone a part-timer just getting started.  You need to save your sanity and focus for college if that's your plan.  Again, I would suggest if at all possible to get an internship or part-time job doing web development while in college.<p>Otherwise, I can't give much more advice because you left out a lot of big details.  For example, web development is a wide open term.  There are a lot of niche areas of development you can get into.  Most broadly, you are looking at being a designer or a programmer.  What skills do you already have?<p>No matter what route you choose, your most important skills aren't going to be your technical skills, but rather your people skills.  You need to be able to give your clients the warm and fuzzies.  You need to be a good communicator.  Perhaps most important is that you need to be a good salesman.  If you are just average with your tech skills but genius on the people side (including selling) then you will be fine.  Being good with sales and savvy with business in general might be the difference between one average developer getting away with charging double or more the rates of an excellent developer who isn't good in this are.<p>So, personally, I would concentrate on school and look for a job doing web development rather than freelancing.  But that's not how I started.  I went against all my advice here and ended up fine.  If you did the same you will probably be fine also.  Good luck either way.",1285515671

In perfect society it would be like that. However, the culture I live in revolts around straight relationships, and there's just no place for homosexuality, except of maybe designating some people as ""them"", in contrast to ""us"". It sucks, but it is the reality. Children growing in this kind of society come to think that being straight is ""default"". That's why I do not think that situation is symmetrical -- it takes more effort to acknowledge that you are gay than that you are straight in this kind of culture.",1285514166

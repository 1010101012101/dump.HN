Much like a salesman on commission.<p>>Get too successful and chances are the company you have an affiliate agreement with will get tired of paying out large sums to you (sound familiar?) They will either kill your relationship outright, or replicate your business model first and then kill your relationship once it&#x27;s taken hold.<p>This is like saying if a salesman gets too successful at his company, they will fire him and make the sales themselves.<p>I&#x27;ve never heard of this happening, and it would be idiotic to do.\nA company gets essentially free money from their affiliates. They take no risk and get marketers that are much smarter than the ones that are on the job market working for them. This is a dream for pretty much every company.\nEven Google has affiliate programs.<p>>Also, other affiliates will do whatever they can to sabotage your efforts.<p>This is like saying your fellow salesmen will sabotage your efforts.<p>Nope. Remember, people aren&#x27;t against you, they are for themselves.\nAffiliates WILL copy what you are doing if you&#x27;re successful, but that happens in sales as well. And who cares? The best will still be the best because they will come up with better things.<p>But this is irrelevant, because if you do what the parent comment says, they can&#x27;t copy you unless they take control of your site.<p>>and trust me it will if you have success<p>Why should I trust you?

If I removed this line:<p><pre><code>    user_pref(&quot;browser.startup.homepage_override.mstone&quot;, &quot;29.0&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n... the browser worked properly again. Very peculiar. Of course, this was written into the prefs.js again upon exit, so when restarted the browser was broken again.<p>Classic Theme Restorer probably wasn&#x27;t the problem.

7676746,comment,7675418,7676263,1,0,logicallee,,,"Why would anything on the Internet take a century?  If you look at a spreadsheet it actually turns out that there is <i>no</i> length of time it could &quot;take over&quot; such that it is a little more stable, and a little stronger, than the USD.<p>For this to happen, for the reasons I mentioned it would have to inflate at between 0-10% per year.  If we go with the ultimate limit of 21 million bitcoins, this means that the price has to move down over time.<p>That cap is at $5.6 billion.  If we assume no mining and a 6% inflation, that would have to move down $5.6, $5.26, $4.94, $4.65, $4.37, $4.10, $3.86 over seven years (in real terms).  That is just a very low market cap for an Internet currency.<p>And if it&#x27;s NOT an internet currency?<p>Then what keeps anyone tied in to bitcoin?  Gold at least has the lock-in of millennia of world-wide acceptance, as well as an absolute scarcity in the sense that no other element has quite the same characteristics, including verifiability.  Further, Gold has significant costs to move and exchange (including transportation, theft prevention, insurance, further verifiability, and so on.)  So even if someone thought Gold was on the decline, it is not nearly so simple to move to something different.<p>Bitcoin has nothing that makes it unique on the Internet - except adoption.  So if it is NOT getting adopted, anyone can move away very easily.  If it IS getting adopted, deflation (scarcity of its supply) is a natural check to that, and people will stop adopting it for the purposes listed.<p>You say I claim &quot;being a major player is the only success condition&quot;.   Not exactly, though that is the situation I analyzed.  Why?<p>Because on the Internet, you can&#x27;t normally play second fiddle to someone&#x27;s leading technology.  There is first fiddle (violin) followed by fourth viola.<p>If people don&#x27;t find bitcoin the <i>most</i> useful Internet currency, they can liquidate their holdings in it in 10 minutes * the number of confirmations they&#x27;d like.  That&#x27;s it.  If they want, they can never use bitcoin again and not lose out on anything.<p>Coupled with the natural mechanism keeping it from reaching large adoption as a leading currency, this is a dangerous formula that results in a shallow market driven by speculation, based on bitcoin&#x27;s historical performance and its unique properties.  As there is no general acceptance of it as a currency, and very good reasons to think that such general acceptance can <i>never</i> materialize, bitcoin simply is in an extremely precarious situation.<p>(Finally a small quibble.  I actually didn&#x27;t compare with the U.S. economy, whose GDP is $16.8 trillion in a year.  In terms of wealth, &quot;The financial position of the United States as of Q4 2012 included ... a total of $91.72 trillion&quot; [1].  That is <i>net</i> worth, obviously some entities will have both debts and assets, all of which is of some value to someone.  So I really was talking about a very small portion of the economy, just the active money supply and nothing else.  7 trillion barely is enough to denominate just 5 months of GDP in just the United States alone, and is comparable to the market cap of all gold ever mined - which sees fairly low usage as a currency.  If we imagine that the whole worldwide Internet is using some currency, it is quite a reasonable number on its market cap, in my opinion.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_position_of_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_position_of_the_Unite...</a> lead",1398895021

For example, can we make stock Linux deny memory access on external buses with a software policy, or is this simply not something that can be accomplished from software?<p>I imagine you have good arguments for why the piecemeal approach is likely to fail in the face of an skilled forensic attacker.  But many of the attacks that you described to me when we last talked about this were more along the lines of hardware-assisted Evil Maid attacks in an unmonitored and unsupervised colo, rather than forensic attacks against an unmodified encrypted laptop.  I&#x27;m curious about how different the threat scenarios are between these two cases now.",1398894990

The title is misleading, and potentially dangerously so - I could see somebody switching to some CBC-like mode in TrueCrypt &quot;coz tptacek said so&quot; (even if that&#x27;s not what he said).<p>And I think several statements are, well, let&#x27;s say disputable. OK, XTS has the unnecessary complication of two keys, introduced in the standardization process. But the security in storage group (whatever it&#x27;s called) has apparently seen the light is working on essentially allowing just one again.<p>Furthermore, XTS is denounced for having &quot;unclear security goals&quot;, and the post leaves the impression that wide-block schemes are so much better. Yet their goals are essentially exactly the same as those of XTS, just on a sector as opposed to a (cipher) block level. And do correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but I believe they are pretty clear: essentially ECB encryption of every cipher block on the disk, with a different key. In more concrete terms, I believe those translate to security under deterministic chosen-plaintext attacks, and non-malleability.<p>Finally Evil Maid attacks (at least the ones presented so far) have absolutely nothing to do with any cipher mode you&#x27;re using, and everything to do with the trusted platform problem. Maybe in a Dropbox setting the attacker could benefit from the cut-n-paste abilities, but I&#x27;m not sure how realistic/severe those attacks would be (presumably you wouldn&#x27;t have your system partition on Dropbox). I&#x27;m having a hard time imagining them, but then again there exist much smarter people than myself in this world.<p>Not to be only critical of the article, I do believe that the basic messages are sound: be aware of the limitations of FDE and don&#x27;t use XTS in the contexts outside of FDE (unless you really know what you&#x27;re doing, I guess).

7676669,comment,7675680,7676529,2,0,slashcom,,,"My understanding of why this isn&#x27;t often the case in the Social Sciences is that data is usually extremely expensive to collect. The researchers usually spend many, many hours writing proposals, revising it, resubmitting it, until they finally have the funding to collect the data their interested in. Then they actually have to get people into a laboratory, or send someone out to do field work (sometimes halfway across the world), or any number of expensive procedures.<p>And then, after data is collected, they begin analyzing it and seeing what are the interesting patterns in the data. And this takes a lot of time, and often you just want to show one thing at a time. In the current environment of publish-or-perish, and grant providers asking what you&#x27;ve done with their money, you might want to take that data you worked so hard to obtain, and milk quite a few publications out of it. If you openly release the data, then others can easily find interesting patterns in your data before you can, beating you to publication, and diminishing your track record for future grants, tenure, etc.<p>So your point is extremely valid. But the counter point of why open data isn&#x27;t feasible is, if a researcher does all the hard legwork necessary to get to the interesting analysis stage, why shouldn&#x27;t they reap the rewards of their hard work (namely, publications and recognition).<p>A few things have been proposed: verification projects (one particular other research group gains access to your data and verifies your results, but is not allowed to use the data otherwise), and grace periods (you have to release your data 3 years after a study or something, giving you time to milk out publications, but still allowing for general verification later).<p>Generally speaking, true scientific verification should also involve the complete recollection of the data. But when data collection is extremely expensive, this is typically infeasible.<p>[I work in a field that&#x27;s almost all open access, and research data is almost always available upon request. So I agree with you. But data is typically incredibly cheap in my field, so the problem above doesn&#x27;t really apply.]",1398894220

An advanced upgrade project would have risked the ability to do that at the very time such risk was unaccepted.<p>That was Germany&#x27;s problem as explained in the article: Even with the assuredly-better Type XXI submarine, Germany would still need many other things to go right to prosecute an interdiction war.

But more than that, it simply doesn&#x27;t matter what format the data is in, or if its well presented. It just has to be accessible. As the ability and scope of data mining methods grows, every piece of scientific data will be fodder, not for humans, but for machines looking back over the entirety of scientific output to draw new conclusions from information we simply ignore today. I would go as far as to say that if you feel your work has any value at all, you have a duty to make your data available, so that it can be mined at a later date.",1398892704

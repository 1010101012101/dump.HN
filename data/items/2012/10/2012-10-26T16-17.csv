Every where I've worked, at some point folks would start wandering around saying ""the internet is down"" which was code for ""help us, we can't use the web"" and various folks would then figure out what their particular issue was, then that problem migrated to my home when we got always on 24/7 internet, something that started out ""why would I use that?"" has become like oxygen ""ZOMG I can't get to the webz!"" and here we have an interesting variant on it that a transit monitoring service notes a lot of disruption. Clearly whom ever is currently the current CIO of the US [1] is not doing their job :-)<p>That said, there are no doubt folks on the other side of those down links with calls in to three or four NOCs, a couple of trouble tickets being escalated, and people driving out to non-nondescript buildings near railroad tracks and in industrial areas carrying weird looking devices which can measure the intensity of laser light and do time-domain reflectometry (TDR) measurements.

Even with their repeat EBS issues, we've engineered around the common failure points, and do so with a tiny number of self-managed VMs relative to our traffic. Even if we were to go down every few months, our hosted services do better than a one-man devops team could ever do on his own in his garage, or even in a co-lo. Though AWS is not expensive, we gladly pay up in order to focus on our own software. Sure beats hiring another person, in our case.<p>The common counter-argument is that if we managed it ourselves, that we'd have the ability to resolve outages on our own, because it'd be our responsibility. <i>That</i> is just the thing, we don't <i>want</i> it to be our responsibility, we've got one ops guy (me), and we need to be iterating on our product fast at this point. We'll instead plan for failure, design our architecture to continue operating under some degree of failure, and keep shipping.<p>Not to say that the ""cloud"" is a silver bullet. It's not. However, especially from the developer point of view, it lets our entire (tiny) team stay more focused on product development.<p>Addendum: I've managed servers in my basement, in co-lo, and in the ""cloud"". Each of these routes is more (or less) appropriate in various cases, but AWS has been a boon to our particular usage case.",1351270076

Interruptions, especially those stemming from the ignorance or poor choices of others, provoke an immediate frustration and bitterness which seems (and probably is) justified.<p>Being justified, however, doesn't mean it's helpful. When I'm faced with these situations I often find myself analyzing in my head all the reasons that I shouldn't have to deal with this, why the person who brought it up is an idiot, how much better it would be if I could just be left to get things done. None of this thinking is productive, or even gratifying, except in the shallowest sense.<p>As hard as it is, the appropriate response to ignorance, idiocy, or other negative stimuli is NOT to be negative, but instead focus on positive solutions.

4702929,comment,4701958,4702338,6,0,mbell,,,"In most sound card designs I've seen there is a 'boost' switch on the output.  In other words there is a toggle that enables a ~10dB boost on the output amplifier (or sometimes the DAC).  The volume control is actually digital but when you hit a particular threshold the external boost is toggled on and digital volume adjusted to maintain a smooth level transition.  If you keep going 'up' with the volume control your still changing the volume digital but you've now got an extra 10dB of gain on the output which can drive the output into clipping if the input signal is full range.<p>EDIT: Just to add.  I would be extremely surprised to see a sound card that isn't a full on pro model have true analog gain control.  I've designed a couple products with such controls (for pre-amp gain, but a similar concept) and you need digitally controlled resistors to accomplish it.  They are large, expensive and touchy to route without inducing noise.

The fundamental issue is signal to noise ratio on the analog line.  If you turn the volume too far down on the computer and turn the volume up on your speakers, the sound on the analog line is too low with regard to the electrical noise and will be hissy.  If you turn the volume up too much on the computer and turn the volume down on your speakers, then the signal will be so loud as to produce distortion either in the DAC or on the line itself.  You're looking for a middle ground: as loud an output from the computer that you can produce without causing distortion in your loudest music parts.

Since this is an analog control one doesn't lose bit depth when turning down the volume and thus this is a fine system to use.<p>Not all machines work this way, though. One way to check is to hook up an external amp and headphones, turn the computer's volume way down and the amp up to listen levels. If the quality is crap the it's probably just decreasing the bit depth. Or you can do a teardown on the sound pathway.<p>(Oh, if it isn't clear by this point, keep all your apps turned all the way up for best quality.

Yet most compilers, even Go, provide a compiler switch to disable bound checking.<p>Lets not forget how many security exploits we have to thank C for exactly this mis-feature.<p>Modula-3, Oberon, Active Oberon are three examples of GC enabled languages with given proofs that is possible to write operating systems in GC enabled languages with zero C code.<p>The Native Oberon and Blue Bottle operating systems were even used for several years as desktop systems at ETHZ.<p>> What exactly are the areas of C use in which you expect Go to replace it?<p>Well, actually it does not have to be Go. Rust and D are also good candidates.<p>The only area where I concede it is hard to replace C is in embedded space, specially if we consider many developers are still using Assembly.<p>As for the areas where human life is at risk we are better off with Ada, Spark or ATS.

He is obviously legally allowed to do all of this, including having an opinion (though I do not believe it <i>should</i> be legal to raise funds for a candidate and also run the machines that count the votes).<p>What I'm saying is: Anyone who builds voting machines should not be taking sides. Especially financial sides. It's a clear conflict of interest, where the result is that I cannot possibly trust the machines to do what they say.<p>The people building them are Republicans. The machines are closed, proprietary devices. They cannot be trusted. Hence, we must assume they are rigged.",1351267301

If you have a GOOD hosting provider, and build out a redundant at every tier cluster, you can easily beat the major cloud providers' uptime.<p>We run about 11 client clusters across ~250 servers across 3 data centers in the US and Europe.

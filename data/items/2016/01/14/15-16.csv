I think the posts contains a lot of useful information, however I believe this kind of response is detrimental toward user acquisition.<p>It&#x27;s very much akin to the tech guy walking into a sale&#x27;s person&#x27;s office, to fix their immediate need. The tech guy is thinking all he has to do is teach the person to think for themselves, problem solved. All the sales guy is thinking is is &quot;oh god, please don&#x27;t teach me anything&quot;.<p>Personally I find locate and slocate very useful in linux to find the files I am after. Going over these might be more useful. That or whatever third party tools are available, with a UI and good UX, to achieve a similar goal.",1452787160

That KILLS battery life. I would not accept this behavior from high end video software, I certainly will not accept it from a text editor.<p>Following that the high RAM use can lead to swapping which will impact performance and battery live. As I said above after a clean install, and with just one short markdown file open, Atom is now using over 2GB RAM and Climbing. Fortunately, I have 16GB RAM on this system, otherwise I would already be swapping.<p>BBEdit and SublimeText never tax the CPU unless I am working with extremely large files, or doing search & replace on a huge number of files. I often will have 50 to 100 files open for days in these editors.<p>I like the evolving ecosystem of Atom, it now looks to be about on par with Sublime, and I can see that it will soon over take Sublime on that front.

If plane tech is always 20 years behind what is possible, it&#x27;s not shocking they don&#x27;t have continuous tracking.<p>There are also other historical reasons. It&#x27;s traditionally the job of the pilots in the plane to keep track of its position, meaning giving them GPS was more valuable than giving position information to the ground. The US is just getting to the point where air traffic control can get GPS from planes, and that is based on ground stations which won&#x27;t work over the ocean.<p>Which leads to the final issue, the outdated nature of the rocketry industry (and the intrinsic difficulty of getting to space), has made it very expensive to launch the satellites you need for worldwide communication. They exist, but they are much more expensive than any other way of communicating. Which means, if the airlines can piggyback on ground based comms (which they can), there&#x27;s not much incentive to make that work over the ocean. Until you lose a plane.",1452786856

There is not actually a trade-off between quality and speed of delivery, especially not when you look medium- or long-term, but also not even in short-term. When you incentivize people to solve a problem in a high-quality way, they tend to also solve it faster and with fewer defects than when they are told to prioritize speed.<p>Also, none of this is nearly as binary as your comment makes it seem to be. Yes, you might lose a little in the short-term to a faster, but more error-prone, competitor. But as long as the loss isn&#x27;t so severe that you become insolvent, then you might live to see the day when all of the competitor&#x27;s errors and sloppy work come home to roost and they fail spectacularly. In general, doing it wrong but fast is pretty worthless, investors and customers will catch on to you and bail, and only the highest level of management will have insulated themselves from the losses that result.<p>Working for a steadier company that prioritizes building a name based upon actual quality, and is willing to tell customers or investors <i>no</i> when they must do so, to regulate feature creep, ensure high quality standards and accuracy, and so forth, is not only much more rewarding, but also more likely to lead to stable income.<p>I think the type of binary, winner-must-take-all-as-soon-as-possible thinking is very destructive. It&#x27;s not a useful mental model of how this stuff actually works, but because so many managers <i>believe</i> that it is, they engage in all kinds of unnecessary and self-destructive anti-quality patterns, and they end up damaging <i>everyone</i> in a tragedy of the commons sort of way.",1452785517

A good example of this &quot;transit as highway capacity extension&quot; approach is the commuter rails in North American cities that only go downtown during peak AM and go to the suburbs in peak PM, and not running the rest of the day. These forms of transit clearly exist to take pressure off of the highways at their most congested time, to free up the space for even more cars and perpetuate highway-oriented development.<p>Good transit options in the absence of highways have a different impact.

This is like joining a Catholic choir and being surprised all the songs are about Jesus, and all the talk of melodies and harmony take a backseat to devotion.<p>As a meditator, I think this push to strip it down and reduce it to just a &quot;stress remover&quot; is counter-productive and will end in situations like yours where you feel the &quot;anti-scientific&quot; (whatever that means) aspects attacked you. The reality here is that meditators, especially teachers, can&#x27;t divorce the emotional, spiritual, ethical, and even supernatural parts of their practice for Western consumers who just want a &quot;fix me&quot; weekend to go back to their busy, complex, and stressful lives. The larger point is to fix/change yourself so you don&#x27;t constantly need &quot;recharge&quot; retreats.<p>I think there&#x27;s been this failed experiment in the last 100 years to strip people of spirituality either by force (Communism) or by shame (Western Determinism/Materialism).  As an lower-case atheist and non-religious person, I find it all incredible bleak and have been, over the years, working my way closer to the &quot;softer&quot; parts of Buddhism.  I&#x27;m pretty much an agnostic with maybe some weak spiritual views now and its a good place to be. I don&#x27;t think you can really expect Buddhists to strip Buddhism from meditation. They find too much value in it the same way I do.  Secular/scientific &quot;stress busting&quot; techniques don&#x27;t work compared to holistic life changes that yes include weird spiritual stuff and counter-modern ideas like living for the moment/experience and not giving into attachment, materialism, emotions, etc. We tried just deep breathing, we tried every psychological fad, we tried drugs, etc. They just don&#x27;t seem to work very well compared to a serious change in lifestyle as described by Buddhism or some school of mediation/Eastern thought.<p>I see people stuck on endless skinner boxes on ipads and consoles. I see people fighting and killing themselves at shitty, stressful jobs (yours truly included), etc. I see conflict all the time and the inevitable race to a Nash equilibria that makes everyone unhappy. Samasara looks real to me, even if you interpret it as a metaphor. I don&#x27;t think its cultish to point out alternatives to the Western idea of &quot;being productive,&quot; or to add some &quot;woo.&quot; Frankly, I&#x27;m not convinced some &quot;woo&quot; isn&#x27;t real. No, I&#x27;m not sending money to Sylvia Brown, but I won&#x27;t be a dismissive asshole when people talk about reincarnation, or how they think Vipassana or Kundalini brought them close to some important spiritual experience, etc.  Funny how we dismiss these experiences, but ask any geek about LSD and he&#x27;ll ramble one for hours how its pretty much spiritualism in a can and everyone nods in lockstep. Perhaps we&#x27;re a little too dismissive of the soft parts of Buddhism in the West.",1452785146

All we can say about crypto/tls is that it hasn&#x27;t been thoroughly reviewed from a cryptographic standpoint. Whether that suits your use case or not is very much up to you.<p>That is still true. Of course, the implementation has been reviewed and beat on in production use more now than it had been in 2013, but the fact remains that there has been no systematic, independent outside audit focused specifically on cryptography. On the other hand, the cascade of &quot;interesting&quot; bugs since 2013 like Goto Fail and Heartbleed suggests that maybe the other implementations are not quite as audited as one might have expected.<p>As tptacek mentioned in another comment, Adam Langley is the primary author and maintainer for Go&#x27;s crypto packages. He&#x27;s also one of the key people involved in Chrome&#x27;s TLS implementation and Google&#x27;s use of TLS more broadly, and he&#x27;s a significant committer to OpenSSL and the creator and maintainer of BoringSSL. You can learn more about his work at his blog, imperialviolet.org. Having Adam involved with Go&#x27;s crypto/tls raises my comfort level considerably. It&#x27;s not Joe Random (or Jane Random) working on the crypto code, as others suggested below. Even so, even experts make mistakes and it would be nice to get a second expert to go through it looking for problems.<p>For the most part Google does not use Go&#x27;s crypto/tls for user-facing traffic. That is primarily a detail of Google&#x27;s pre-existing serving architecture (we use separate servers to do that, much like putting nginx in front of your main server, and many engineering years of work went into those servers before Go even started). Because of that, Google has not really evaluated Go&#x27;s crypto/tls one way or the other for that use. I believe we do run Go&#x27;s crypto/tls to serve HTTPS on godoc.org, although I&#x27;d have to double-check. I certainly run it on swtch.com, rsc.io, and so on, not that there are real secrets in any of those servers.<p>I suspect the largest production user of Go&#x27;s crypto/tls is CloudFlare. Maybe someone from there can say something about their comfort level or exposure.<p>Like Andrew said, it&#x27;s really up to the provider of the service to make the call.

You don&#x27;t even need a real scanner; just pretend with a stapler or something vaguely the right shape and weight. You should also go through your cupboards and just scan everything once to simulate the initial load. Then, I don&#x27;t know whether you mean to design this for yourself or for selling to others, but if it&#x27;s the latter, consider whether your customers will actually do this for any period of time.

The user does not need to re-authenticate when reconnecting. Indeed, the entire process can be completely automated and nearly invisible to the user. All established connections will remain alive while roaming. This feature is intended for mobile users who move around between networks.</i><p>> <i>Technically, roaming is accomplished by closing the TCP tunnel when the connection is suspended. When resuming, a new TCP connection is made to the server and the SSH data stream is continued through this new connection. The user does not need to authenticate again, instead the client authenticates to the server, without user interaction, with the help of a random password which was made up when the user authenticated at the start of the session. In addition to knowing this password, the client must also know the encryption keys and encryption state to be able to reconnect. It is therefore impossible for a third party to break in and take over a suspended session.</i><p>I particularly like that last sentence.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://download.cryptzone.com/files/download/AppGate-10.2.3/doc/manual_chunked_html/ch03s03.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://download.cryptzone.com/files/download/AppGate-10.2.3/...</a>",1452784868

The problem is that the value that can be extracted is bounded by my actual problems. Nest can&#x27;t fundamentally transform my house heating experience into some sort of delight; at the absolute limit, all it could possibly do is cut my heating bill down to $0. Which would be amazing, but it can&#x27;t do that, of course.<p>Other IoT possibilities I see tossed about have even worse possibilities; Nest is probably already the biggest possible winner. If you eliminate 100% of the time I spend turning lights on and off, you&#x27;ve basically had no impact on my life. If you design a glorious IoT refrigerator that somehow requires 0 <i>additional</i> time out of my life to feed it data (which is a negative) it still has to face up to the fact that my &quot;display&quot; showing me what I have which I can get to by simply opening the door is superior to any practical front-mounted display. There&#x27;s very little room for any sort of IoT water-use optimizer, certainly nothing a startup could wedge into and make money. What can the IoT do for my washer and dryer, play tunes off of Pandora while I&#x27;m loading them? My cell can already do that.<p>I don&#x27;t need an Internet of Things. I need a Robot of doing Things, and if it&#x27;s hooked up to the internet I rather expect we&#x27;ll still see it as &quot;a robot&quot; rather than &quot;an IoT device&quot;. (I don&#x27;t think I want my robot live hooked up to the internet anyhow.)<p>And just to be clear, I&#x27;ll say again I totally get it for commercial and civil use, so I&#x27;m not just down on IoT in general. (I&#x27;m down on IoT <i>security</i> in general, but that&#x27;s a separate problem. Sort of. Close enough for now anyhow.) It just seems to me that the vast bulk of the IoT story involves being not physically proximal to the IoT device (and, indeed, note how the core Nest use case of &quot;turning off the heat <i>when you are not there</i>&quot; fits that to a T), and therefore, unless you live in a mansion, it&#x27;s solving a problem a homeowner mostly doesn&#x27;t have.",1452784747

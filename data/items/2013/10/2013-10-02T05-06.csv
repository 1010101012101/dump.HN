Take .NET&#x27;s String.Split function which takes a char array. If you pass in a new array each time, there&#x27;s a whole heap-alloc for no reason. Or Tuples. Or closure objects. Things like that <i>do</i> add up (GC cost, even though small short-lived objects are fast, it isn&#x27;t zero), and escape analysis/stack alloc can make a huge difference, sometimes.<p>I&#x27;ve come to this conclusion while writing a &quot;high-speed&quot; indexer program where manually avoiding tiny allocations in certain areas provided double-digit percent improvements.

These two new companies should both get full access to the current Microsoft technology stack.

And since our perception of colour is relative to different contexts, that makes the research even harder to account for. That all said, an &quot;unseeable&quot; colour to my mind really refers to how if you put two very, very similar colours together, only some people can tell them apart, and perhaps more often once they&#x27;ve learned to recognize the difference? No idea how close I am to the mark, as I haven&#x27;t listened to any of this or read much source material.

6480840,comment,6480631,6480631,3,0,memracom,,,"Yes, there is no question that C# is sufficient to write an OS. However, you would need to ignore/replace the libraries that are normally used with C# applications. Instead you would write your own low-level libraries that provide only the kind of services that an OS requires. But the biggest hurdle will be the compiler. A normal C# compiler only generates bytecodes that will be run on the .NET or the Mono virtual machine engines. You will need an additional stage of compiler that either produces machine code, or something that can easily be converted to machine code such as C code or GCC&#x27;s intermediate representation. It is a hurdle but not a massive one since there is a lot of support out there for writing compilers. People have recently been writing compilers for a number of languages that emit Javascript and your hurdle is no more complex.<p>When you write your compiler you will probably end up leaving out some C# features such as reflection, because they are too intertwined with .NET. This is common with other languages when people have tried to write a compiler that emits machine code and it does not usually cause a problem because the problem of interfacing with hardware does not demand the same features from a language as building a modern web app does.<p>Do your research before starting this because you will likely find a lot of projects that have already built bits and pieces that you can reuse.",1380692156

Among other things, this would include a brand new way for writing user interfaces, codenamed Avalon, that would be thoroughly modern, vector-based, and hardware-accelerated. Windows itself would be written to use WinFX for its user-visible programsExplorer, calculator, and so onand, going forward, .NET would be the way to write Windows applications. Win32 would still exist for backwards compatibility, but it would be frozen and left static.<p>* Longhorn would have been the end of the old ways of writing Windows programs, and the dawn of a new era of modern Windows development, one that was not hamstrung by design decisions made ten or fifteen years prior.<p>* As we all know now, Longhorn never shipped as such. The project grew enormous, unmanageable, and broken. Around the same time, Windows XP, on which Longhorn was based, was being ravaged by hackers. Microsoft poured its resources into making Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 tolerably securean effort that culminated in Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1then, for the most part, started development of its next operating system, the one eventually to ship as Windows Vista, all over again.<p>* One of the biggest losers in this developmental reboot was .NET. Windows Vista, though radical in some ways, abandoned the entire &quot;WinFX&quot; concept.

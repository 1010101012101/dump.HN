I spend 1/2 hour or so composing and editing a rather in-depth post, and no one sees it.<p>This happens either because that thread has been pushed off of the front page, or the thread is already filled with comments which are only a couple lines, and while they may be reasonable and appropriately toned, seem to me to be a superficial analysis...<p>3.) Multiple articles on the same topic, all making it to the front page, even they don't really add anything to each other. It would be cool to merge articles/threads on the same topic.<p>4.) Blog links that do nothing but redirect to another blog or article. i.e. ""x y has posted on y z; here's a link""...<p>5.) edit: Here's another: Karma is directly proportional to how early you post in the thread (by virtue of time being linear and people only visiting a thread a certain number of times).<p>There are more, but I can't think of them at the moment.",1305917133

2568917,comment,2568453,2568491,12,0,famousactress,,,"So here's my observation of what I think has changed.. I think the hidden scores have made the comment scoring higher in contrast.<p>By that I mean that I think the standard deviation in scores has gotten much higher, and the top few posts end up with higher scores than they used to.. for better or worse. I've had comments that were useful but far from brilliant end up with 40+ points, and I think the biggest reason is momentum. I think being able to see the scores was probably giving people an opportunity to say ""10 points, yep.. that's a 10 point comment"" and leave it alone.<p>So.. if that's true (and it'd be great to see numbers to back up or refute it).. then I'm not sure if it's better or worse.. but I'd tend to think it's not a great thing, since it makes it more likely that early useful comments are voted better than later brilliant ones.<p>At any rate.

It depends on CSS3 2D Transforms.  Because the 2D Transforms spec is not yet a Candidate Recommendation, browser vendors currently implement it with vendor prefixes in case the spec changes before it's finalized.  2D Transforms are implemented in recent versions of IE (-ms-transform), Opera (-o-transform), Gecko (-moz-transform), and WebKit (-webkit-transform).  However, the library uses only -webkit-transform.<p>That wouldn't be so bad, except that it does this in a way that potentially breaks the page in other browsers.  For example, mobile Firefox supports overflow scrolling without any need for libraries.  In the latest nightly builds of mobile Firefox 6 (which support touch events), adding iscroll.js to your page will actually <i>break</i> scrollable elements that work fine without the library.<p>The solution is two-fold: (1) If you are using vendor-prefixed APIs you can easily support more implementations, and (2) do feature detection to fail gracefully on implementations that you don't support.  And yes, I plan to submit patches to these projects to address these problems.<p>(disclosure: I am a mobile Firefox developer)",1305914692

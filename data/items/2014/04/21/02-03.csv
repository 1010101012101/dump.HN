What I told you is that you should read that book, because it&#x27;s an extremely interesting and balanced view on alternative energy, from someone who actually knows what he&#x27;s talking about. He doesn&#x27;t push a particular agenda or lead the reader to any particular conclusions, he just lays out what the implications of the various options are.<p>For example, for solar or wind to play a significant part in the UK&#x27;s energy requirements would require the aforementioned country-sized installations. Do you think that the British people would be willing to accept 10% of the area of the country being totally dedicated to energy generation? How would they decide which 10% it should be? Do you think that they would accept tidal generators along the entirety of the coast of the UK? That&#x27;s the order of magnitude that is required.<p>Additionally, since renewable resources tend to be variable, you need a storage mechanism. You either need a lot of hills to pump water up, or you need your entire population to be using electric cars and to have smart chargers that allow the grid to draw back from when required. Are these things possible? Absolutely they are. However MacKay leaves the reader to ponder how likely they are to happen in our current political environment, and I shall do the same.",1398049160

Yes people like to pretend they are atheist values, &quot;humanist&quot; (you&#x27;d think scientific education would prevent people from thinking moral values are associated with a natural object like that, but I guess not) ... yet they defend equal rights for all people, equal rights for the sexes, protecting the weak, they go very far in the rights of children, pro-adoption, anti-war (in the sense that they are against war unless in defence), they defend freedom of trade, ... All very much Christian moral positions (well, especially that specific combination is distinctly Christian. E.g. islam does have freedom of trade, as it is mostly based on Roman law), distinct from other religions. If you judge any other religion by this modern standard it will fail badly. Especially equality is rare.<p>The problem is that islam is just a very bad example of a religion, but it is not special. It is not the worst (certainly natural religions are far worse), but none of it&#x27;s rules are exceptional at all.<p>The norm in human history, and likely the majority position of all humans worldwide is what one would consider bad religions&#x27; positions. Death for gay people, or generally any sex outside marriage. Death for freedom of expression. Death for sex outside marriage. Religious or physical leaders get to execute people. No separation between church and state. Neutral or pro position to slavery. War as the default position due to religious or ethnic &quot;eternal&quot; conflicts or &quot;holy&quot; wars.

To see the difference, consider: if you are doing work that requires skills (as I&#x27;m sure most HN readers are, since computer programming is such work), those skills are capital that you possess, and your pay, according to standard economic usage, is partly return on that capital, not compensation for labor. (Basically, the difference between your pay and the pay of an unskilled person, like the burger flipper at McDonald&#x27;s, is return on capital--it&#x27;s actually not quite that simple because variations in productivity at similar skill levels, due to automation, also come into play, but that&#x27;s the gist of it.)<p>I have not read Piketty&#x27;s book, so I can&#x27;t say for sure how he is using the term &quot;return on capital&quot;, but it seems to me that in order to properly interpret the data he appears to be using, one has to pay very careful attention to the distinction I made above.

Why compete on merit when you can buy competitive power straight from the political apparatus?<p>Meanwhile back in reality, omnipotence is not an assumption you can make. Cryptocurrencies stand a good chance of removing power over the free movement of capital from political authorities. Even forgetting technology advancements that may allow people to entirely circumvent capital controls, there is the tried and true method of employing hordes of lawyers and accountants to tailor schemes to achieve the same ends through political channels.<p>Putting all of this aside though, the fundamental r > g observation is conditional. <i>If</i> the return on capital is greater than overall economic growth, inequality increases. However, real growth is a function of the increase in the wealth of an economy, if capital cannot find opportunities to increase growth by investment then capital returns as well as growth will fall. Less growth, less return on capital.<p>Unless of course you can manage to subvert the entire monetary system through political channels and provide direct taps to the investment class so that even if they&#x27;re not productively investing in anything and seeing real returns linked to growth they still see returns from quantitative easing and early access to new money.

My biggest caution going forward though: The body really dislikes foreign objects, like really.<p>>&quot;...it seems like the complexity in prosthetic is not the mechanics, but interpreting the signals properly to control the device.&quot;<p>You couldn&#x27;t be more correct! Dr. Richard Weir at CU Denver[0] has some great work in 3-D printed hands. The lack of controls into the hands is a major concern. The issue is you only have so many muscles in the arm to control all the complex motions of a hand. His group is working on the eigen-states of hand movement, trying to decompose them into the number of muscles in your arm.<p>Why the arm? Well, it makes sense to focus there, as that is where patients&#x27; minds are focused. The method is myocardial sensors that sense the nerve firings in the peripheral nervous system and then can send out that data. You basically implant them in a muscle fiber and they last a long time.<p>>... a lot more electrical sensors than today (maybe 16 to 256, something on that order)...<p>This would be awesome. But, focusing on a prosthetic hand, we don&#x27;t have that many muscles in the arm to control that many[1]. The hand is much more complicated than the arm. Decomposing gestures, as Dr. Weir is doing now is a good step in that direction.<p>>...Just throw data and processing at it rather than trying to fully understand how nerves work.<p>How true this is! Much is being done in the Big Data era of neuroscience that we live in. Many groups are trying this tactic[2]. The thought is to just describe what the system of a brain does, not how it works. Think Gaussians, not Markov chains.<p>>...Doing the reverse, to stimulate nerves based on how much power each motor is using, should be simpler.<p>Feedback is very important to prostheses and helps improve care and quality of life. However, directly stimulating nerves is difficult. Your fingertips have much better &#x27;resolution&#x27; than your elbow does[3]. Also, your skin also becomes accustomed to the input and you will ignore that stimulus pretty quickly. Like how you notice the smell of the food when you walk in the door, but don&#x27;t within 10 minutes of standing next to the stove.<p>>...It could be sloppier because the human mind would learn to interpret the signals better than a computer.<p>The body does acclimate to the stimuli, but as I said before, it also starts to ignore as well. Also, people are all different. Genes can account for a lot of the differences, as well as environment, but also even culture and gender[4]<p>>...As long as I am dreaming, we also need a moonshot to standardize nerve implants.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you mean here. Each person&#x27;s situation is very different and personal. Standardizing is difficult with medicine.. Skin color, size, weight, culture, gender, job, etc all greatly vary. For example, a scuba instructor&#x27;s situation is a lot different than a 1st grade teacher&#x27;s. The scuba guy has to deal with greatly varying pressure and water. The teacher has to have the new hand be fit for children. The nerve implants will have to follow their situations.<p>>...a faraday cage built into the arm to prevent interference.<p>Your blood is mainly salt water, which is very conductive, so there is not real need to cage things.  In fact, you want to encase everything in silicone to prevent leaks and make it all non-bioreactive.<p>>...the noise produced by the body’s movements would be statistically significant enough for another input into a neural net.<p>The noise in a muscle is hard to figure out. Again, it depends on the person, the muscles, the salt content in the blood, etc. In a nerve, the picture is much the same. I will quote without citation that the firing rates of nerves increase with temperature to the 4th power (I&#x27;d love a citation, if anyone can find one, my brain is just borking now)<p>>...Anyway, chemical markers on the terminals could urge the nerves to grow into the terminals.<p>This is non-trivial and may not be possible. Those markers often are only present in a real soup, and the behavior of nerve growth is not well understood (at least by me, haha). I&#x27;ll admit it&#x27;s possible, but a lot of engineering is needed to do it.<p>>...put the patient on immune suppression drugs until the nerves grow together,<p>Wow, that is not a good idea. Going on immunosuppressants is not taken lightly, and you&#x27;d have a heck of a time convincing people to take that big of a risk just for a hand or something. Also, they won&#x27;t be necessary in the peripheral nervous system, just the central nervous system.<p>>...Another idea would be to press a comb-shaped device with hundreds of microscopic channels through the nerve bundle and read the voltage through each channel.<p>Dr. Theodore Berger at USC is working on a device like this already![5]<p>>...It should be manufactured for longevity and to read the most amount of data possible, and just let the programmers work out how to sift through it.<p>If you&#x27;d like to join up, many neuroscience departments really favor physics, CS, and EE majors for grad study these days, at least it seems to me like they are.<p>The peripheral nervous system is a real good area for these neural ideas. But the central nervous system (CNS) is not. The reason is glial scarring[6]. You body really really does not like things in the CNS. This is why paralysis happens mainly. The scar prevents the nerves in your spine from regrowing and making the legs and whatnot work again (sort-of). This takes place in your brain to a huge degree. I used to work with place cells[7](very cool cells) and everyday we would have to &#x27;burn off&#x27; the scarring by passing current through the electrode bundle. It turns out, you are your own worst enemy here. Ideas like opto-genetics[8] can bypass the scarring issues, but they also have a host of others.<p>Again, great ides and enthusiasm! I love it! If you see a future with neuroscience, the field is wide open these days and there seems to be a bit of money floating around. Apply to a progam or 12 and you&#x27;ll have a great time.<p>[0]<a href=""http://www.ucdenver.edu/about/newsroom/newsreleases/Pages/Bioengineer-developing-prosthetic-hand-and-fingers-that-perform-full-range-movement.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ucdenver.edu/about/newsroom/newsreleases/Pages/Bi...</a><p>[1]<a href=""http://www.innerbody.com/anatomy/muscular/arm-hand"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.innerbody.com/anatomy/muscular/arm-hand</a><p>[2]It&#x27;s easter, I&#x27;m not counting how many!

Lots of money means lots of power, in the sense of causing a lot of change (negative as well as positive).<p>And I do not think that there is necessarily something wrong with that. We all seem to praise the billionaire Elon Musk here on HN for making space flight more efficient. And I think he is a very capable individual who amassed a lot of power/money and is thus able to effect a lot of change. Why should I complain about this?<p>I would argue that the only things that hurt a society when it comes to accumulation of wealth/power is actually _using it in a detrimental_ sense.<p>Things such as:\n - luxuries\n - buying laws in your (corporations) favor\n - using a lot of resources (ore, land) inefficiently<p>The more I think about it, and having recently read another person here on HN mention it, the more I think something that broadly falls under the idea of &#x27;Geolibertarianism&#x27; would bring us closer to a more just society. And, no I am not talking about &#x27;solving our problems&#x27; here, because I think having problems is inherent to being a human.<p>Actually taxing the bad effects of money instead of owning/moving/etc. money itself would also solve e.G. the problem on how to deal with the existence crypto-currencies without resorting to draconian measures.<p>Finally, I think that we as humans tend to shy away from even just criticizing the actual bad effects of power. I think this is as much a problem as the people with power misbehaving in the first place. Most of us, myself included, simply seem to have a very strong &#x27;follow the leader&#x27; emotion, and we rather argue about secondary issues than the real problems. Or we invent powerless utopias and start to believe in them (Marxism, Feminism, ...), actually becoming controllable by the malevolent powers.<p>But maybe I am just naive.<p>*edit: typo(s)",1398047171

7619417,comment,7618933,7619342,4,0,betterunix,,,"My best guess about why people are still using C and C++ is this:  there is a massive, valuable ecosystem of software written in these languages.  It is hard to write software in one language that links with software written in other languages, especially where performance is a concern.  The fact that all commonly used commercial OSes are both written in C and expose C APIs has kept C and C++ alive more than anything else.<p>Performance?  Lisp can give you that, as can OCaml, Haskell, and other <i>better</i> languages.  Real time system?  There is a mountain of research on real-time garbage collection and on using HLLs for real-time systems.  Operating system kernel?  OSes were once written in Lisp, and OSes could conceivably be written in other HLLs.<p>Throw in a requirement to interoperate with a C library and suddenly things get ugly.  Yeah, sure, you have an FFI, but debugging across a language barrier is difficult (I have had to do it, it is agony).  Suddenly you need to worry about pinning objects so that the garbage collector won&#x27;t move them while some C library expects them to stay still.  In some cases your code basically becomes C but with the syntax of an HLL, and you start to wonder why you did not just write that routine in C to begin with (it would have made your life easier).  Performance matters but your compiler needs to set up a trampoline so that your code can provide some kind of callback, and now that is a bottleneck that kills all that other optimization work.  Then some joker writes some C++ code, and the rest of your week is spent writing wrapper functions because your FFI cannot deal with the name mangler.<p>At the end of the day there is no particular technical reason for C or C++ to remain so popular, and a big pile of technical reasons to stay away from such languages.  C made a bit of sense in the 1970s when computers were small and the understanding of compilers and programming languages was less well developed.  At this point C and C++ are a liability that we are all stuck with.  Maybe some day the expense of sticking with C and C++ will outweigh the expense required to switch to better languages, but I am not holding my breath.",1398046977

The player benefits because he gets to train and learn with the best, and the team benefits by either getting a great player for X seasons, or selling him on the market to another team.<p>If a company could take the risk of training new developers for 6 months, they should also get the benefit of selling the employee. As an example, if I brought 10 inexperienced hires in and train them for 6 months, I should be able to take (say) 25% of their first year salary, or anything over $50k that they make in their first year.

There&#x27;s also a lot in this article that&#x27;s plainly implying the wrong things about what Lisp is capable of doing.<p>If we are to talk about types, I&#x27;d hope people would look at languages like Haskell or Standard ML—or maybe even ATS, Agda, or Coq—for future direction, <i>not</i> Lisp.<p>Unlike Lisp, C++ lets one write efficient, generic algorithms that can operate on several types of data. Lisp cannot, and falls back to dynamic type testing, which makes for slower code[1]. Basically your only option in Lisp is to specialize everything manually, or inline everything. Both approaches are extremely poor. As I hinted, Haskell and Standard ML do an even better job than both C++ or Lisp. This is talked about a good bit in this article [2].<p>(Also, for the record, Lisp has no concept of information hiding, interfaces, or APIs. And no, Lisp&#x27;s packages are just convenient structures for grouping somehow related symbols together.)<p>The article talked about declaring function types in Lisp. Many implementations plainly <i>ignore</i> those and they provide <i>no</i> value. It doesn&#x27;t help that idiomatic Lisp code usually doesn&#x27;t include such declarations.<p>Lastly, a lot of the things in this article were SBCL specific, and had little to do with the Lisp language itself.<p>Like others have said, I don&#x27;t think any points demonstrate that C++ is converging to Lisp. And if it were, that&#x27;s probably a bad direction anyway, given the author&#x27;s initial statements about heading toward an algorithmic language.<p>[1] No implementation of Lisp has true, flexible compile-time polymorphism or any type-algebraic structure; all inferred types must be concretely realized during the inference.<p>[2] <a href=""http://symbo1ics.com/blog/?p=1495"" rel=""nofollow"">http://symbo1ics.com/blog/?p=1495</a>",1398046382

Using an Android app, selecting your youtube video, then doing &quot;send to TV&quot; is great when we bother to do it.<p>The &quot;smart&quot; Panasonic is a dumb screen in front of Roku.  The only other non-dumb features we use is the &quot;play videos from SD card&quot; feature, and the &quot;play from DLNA (my laptop)&quot; feature -- both get used quite often, and work well.",1398045746

The developer manager must manage development first and foremost, it is a bit weird if they are handed project management responsibilities also, which can generally be handled by a less senior person, perhaps one who doesn&#x27;t even code.<p>If there are other teams, I would assume we aren&#x27;t talking about a small startup anymore. But even if we were talking about a small startup with one team working on a product, it makes sense to delegate project management tasks to someone in the team who isn&#x27;t managing the team.<p>A developer manager should be able to protect their team from shit work because they know what shit work looks like in the first place. They should also understand the parts at a high enough level to make informed decisions, and they at least know who knows the details so they can get input from the right people when problems arise.",1398045704

1025629,comment,1025232,1025344,0,0,haberman,,,"> As a standard, XML is actually pretty simple and, in my opinion, well thought out.<p>XML is good at text markup, but not good at data structures, which is what everyone inevitably tries to use it for.  This is the basic problem.<p>XML by itself is a way to create tree structures of text strings.  There are no data types (only strings), no schema, and no clear mapping to actual data structures in programming languages.<p>The evidence of XML's inadequacy for data structure serialization is that it takes a mountain of specifications (XML Schema, DOM) to address all of the needs that XML by itself does not satisfy.  And even with all these specifications, there is no simple way to (for example) serialize an array of integers into XML and have them get deserialized into the same ten integers, without doing your own text manipulation.<p>XML has had ten years of almost no serious competition and the favor of the w3c and the web community, and all we have to show for it is an ever growing pile of specs that still fail to make data interchange easy.  Also, XML is horribly inefficient.<p>What is the right answer?  Protocol Buffers.  They are 3-10x smaller, 20-100x faster to parse, they have a schema built in with real data types at the lowest level of the stack, they have both a binary and a text format, and they have a much more natural mapping onto real data structures.  Compare:<p><pre><code>  cout << ""Name: "" << person.name() << endl;\n  cout << ""E-mail: "" << person.email() << endl;\n</code></pre>\nwith:<p><pre><code>  cout << ""Name: ""\n       << person.getElementsByTagName(""name"")->item(0)->innerText()\n       << endl;\n  cout << ""E-mail: ""\n       << person.getElementsByTagName(""email"")->item(0)->innerText()\n       << endl;\n</code></pre>\n(The examples and some of the statistics I quoted come from <a href=""http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/docs/overview.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/docs/overview.ht...</a>)",1262346961

However, how do you define 'excellent'? A uni degree isn't indicative of excellent. It's not even a required component of 'excellent'.",1262346864

1025625,comment,1024709,1025218,0,0,cstross,,,"Yes, this.<p>Cringely opined some years ago that tech companies evolve through three categories (or stages of development): technology driven, sales driven, and marketing driven.<p>There's an assumption in this ontology: that growth and evolution of a tech company is predicated on new technology.<p>The new (post-1997, Jobs II) Apple breaks this rule. Apple is <i>design</i> driven, at a level that makes more sense to folks with a Fine Art degree than a CS background. (The reason for their success? Lots of folks with an aesthetic background <i>like</i> this stuff and will pay extra for it.) They're seeking a better user experience, vertically integrated at all levels with their web ecosystem.<p>Gruber -- who's been tracking apple for something like 20 years -- gets this. J. Random Gizmo columnist doesn't.",1262346052

So they opened it out...</i><p>Webkit started as a fork of KHTML (part of KDE and LGPL licenced) their mishandling of it is a good example of how not to work with open source.<p>Andriod is another. As Google isn't developing it in public they're carrying the full cost. And their re-creating of userland libraries to avoid the LGPL is pretty much the opposite of your argument (though possibly inherited from before Google bought Android).<p>Aside from your examples I agree with your point. It's similar to one Doctorow makes in Makers that everything turns into a commodity after a few years and it doesn't make you money anymore. However it can still act as a barrier of entry so examples like Chadaustin's can still make sense if maintenance costs don't dominate.",1262344377

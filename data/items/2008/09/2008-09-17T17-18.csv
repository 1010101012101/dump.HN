Good example, by the way.

Looks like VirtualPBX offered to rescind the deal and are asking him to resolve the dispute through the dispute resolution procedures that are already outlined in the agreements he's signed<p>So why is this guy blogging about this - looks like its hurting him as much as anything else<p>This comes straight from the article  ->>>>>""Virtual PBX is a small, privately held, non VC funded, 10-year old family enterprise that took a calculated business risk by acquiring the assets of Brian McConnell's business in an attempt to further the progress of its technology. Brian willingly signed a business agreement with Virtual PBX and subsequently entered into an employment contract with the company. Those facts are not in dispute.<p>Virtual PBX contends that Brian breached material terms of the agreement as well as the subsequent employment contract. We do not believe it appropriate to discuss the nature of the ongoing contract disagreement publicly, despite the fact that Brian has issued a stream of what we regard as misleading and even malicious statements in his blog about the relationship.<p>We do take exception that Brian has chosen to invoke the mantle of privacy as a means to avoid taking responsibility for his behavior. He chose to store large volumes of data on a company issued laptop, some of which was unrelated to company business. The laptop and the data stored on it were appropriately retained by the company upon his departure. The company's only interest in the data stored on the computer is that which relates to business issues. Brian's allegation the company committed cybercrime is malicious and unfounded. It is unfortunate Brian has chosen to pursue counter-productive rhetoric in lieu of reaching a mutually acceptable and business-like solution to this contract dispute.""<p>Also says ----
They told me the company ""has also requested that he resolve the dispute through the dispute resolution procedures that are already outlined in the agreements he's signed, and that Virtual PBX has even offered to rescind the deal with him and give him back everything he sold to the company including the IP.""",1221670869

Namely, when I said that a spaceship traveling exponentially close to the speed of light would collapse to a black hole: that&#x27;s <i>only</i> true because, when the spaceship inevitably collided with some interstellar particle, the energy in the center-of-momentum rest frame would be exponential. A spaceship in a theoretical vacuum could get arbitrarily close to the speed of light without collapsing.<p>>However, it&#x27;s important to understand that this doesn&#x27;t change the computational situation in any important way. It&#x27;s still true that, to accelerate exponentially close to the speed of light, you need an exponential amount of energy! And therefore, it will take you exponential time to accelerate to such a speed---<i>unless</i> your fuel tank (or whatever else is providing your energy) is exponentially concentrated, in which case it will exceed the Schwarzschild limit and indeed collapse to a black hole.",1397252864

I was in a head on collision on a small two lane residential street with no other traffic.  Both vehicles were going 35mph, so effective collision speed was ~70mph.   I was on a motorcycle and the oncoming truck was on a cell phone.  He veered into my lane, and I tried to move left but parked cars limited my ability to avoid him.  After the collision, I flew for a distance, and on landing my head hit the point of the curb.  The two things that saved my life was (obviously) my helmet--without it, by brain would have been on the street--and I had crash bars that were severely deformed after the accident, but they kept my left leg from getting pinned between the bike and the truck.<p>So relatively high speed accidents can be survivable, especially with modern technology.

Then you can choose various ways to extend.<p>* You could pick a completely different approach, and define interop points.  This tends to have a steep learning curve.  E.g. python interops with C very well, yet most people nevertheless avoid interop.<p>* You could define the old system in terms of the new system or vice versa.  That way, you eventually have clear path to use only one system completely.  However, it also means you need to at least support all the various crufty bits you may not otherwise care about.  It&#x27;s also not easy to learn.<p>* You could just extend the old system.  You don&#x27;t get to clean things up by hiding them behind interop or a layer of translation, but at least the learning curve isn&#x27;t so bad - you only touch what you want.<p>That last bit is the basically the strategy that wins.  Adding a new system is just such a pain unless it entire replaces the old system (which is almost impossible in practice if only for reasons of momentum), that it&#x27;s really hard to go half way.  Also, don&#x27;t forget that &quot;mere&quot; interop is far from trivial since it&#x27;s not just CSS, but also javascript&#x27;s interaction with DOM+CSS that you&#x27;d need to emulate/interop with.<p>So that leaves us with things like flexbox: new techniques, but integrated into what we have rather than side-by-side with complex interop.",1397252079

Instead of a one-time “Like”, you convey how strongly you &quot;feel” posts based on how long you hold down a &quot;feel&quot; button and how many times you press it.<p>As an author, your focus shifts from the superficial (what you&#x27;re doing, food porn, a random link) to the &quot;why” (how you feel, the emotion underlying what you&#x27;re sharing). As a reader, you&#x27;re not just incrementing a Like counter; you&#x27;re communicating how much you empathize with your friend.<p>Also exciting: emotional trends (how UCLA feels today, or the reactions to #yc or #obama)<p>—<p>I’ve been flying solo with design/dev for 3-4 weeks. I surprised myself with what I came up with in that time, but there’s still a lot missing and ample room to improve on implementation/security/UX/marketing/etc issues. Right now I’m in a private alpha with <100 friends, but I’d love to get your feelings on Feel (so punny.)<p>For a better idea of Feel, you can follow me @randy (can also provide my temp Feel password - email in profile). From YC, Kevin Hale (@rbg) and Joseph Walla (@joseph) also took the time to try it out (thanks!), so you can follow them too.<p>Thank you for your time! Excited to hear your feedback/questions.<p>(PS: I applied for YC S14. Somewhat of a risk to put this out there right before they announce interviews, but either way I&#x27;m committed to growing Feel through various deadlines/targets in the next few years. Either way, it’s a huge value add to get honest, insightful feedback from a community I respect.)<p>To Feel, go here:\nhttp://feelapp.co",1397252057

Once published a subsequent patent application for that invention would fail to be novel or inventive. That doesn&#x27;t mean no one will apply, nor even that such an application wouldn&#x27;t be granted, just that prior publication of the invention is an absolute defence.<p>Of course you&#x27;d want to be sure whether the invention is already patented before you try to exploit it commercially.",1397252031

While I&#x27;d like to find a role where I can keep learning so that I&#x27;m a better founder next time, getting some cash is the first priority. I&#x27;m also not sure what sort of jobs I&#x27;m qualified for... like many founders I did a bit of everything so my skillset is more broad than deep. I built the tech for my startups (CRUD apps, nothing fancy) and am about 2 chapters through SICP, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m advanced/skilled enough for a software engineering position in the Valley.<p>Before the startups I was an i-banking analyst at GS/JPM/MS and I passed all the CFA exams.

They&#x27;re called constraints, but they&#x27;re more like optimization targets, and while in simple cases it&#x27;s easy to see which constraint gets violated first, in complex cases it&#x27;s a little too much like spagetti code: theoretically deterministic, but too much to handle.<p>CSS also has &quot;constraints&quot; and they&#x27;re also sometimes violated, but most constraints are never violated (e.g. normal flow blocks are always sequentially after each other even if they don&#x27;t fit.  Those that are violated are violated in consistent, predictable fashion: e.g. though a container vertically grows to fit its contents it may stop growing for various reasons, even if its children don&#x27;t fit.<p>In GSS? Since every layout reinvents the wheel for the basics, all bets are off.  Since the whole point is that there can be complex, multilevel interactions between the components it&#x27;s not always clear which &quot;constraint&quot; is violated first, nor even that it may be necessary to violate those constraints.<p>Basically: I think GSS is too hard to reason about, making it admittedly more flexible, but too error prone compared to CSS.  Furthermore, because it <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> integrate with lower-level concepts like actual content, it&#x27;s sometimes even less powerful that CSS - GSS can&#x27;t for instance emulate CSS tables or even simple paragraphs that are no longer than necessary; for that (AFAICT) it delegates to existing layouts.<p>Then there&#x27;s the fact that CSS breaks cycles quite rigorously.  Usually it&#x27;t not even possible to define them; and where it is the spec is fairly clear what needs to give.  In GSS, I can&#x27;t see any protection - you won&#x27;t even really notice you&#x27;ve potentially got a problem until constraints do weird things for hard to predict reasons.<p>So, I think for most layouts GSS is wordier and more brittle than CSS, and where that&#x27;s not the case I&#x27;d rather have a more robust, predictable system.  In essence: the stronger, more flexible, closer to turing-complete a language, the worse.  Weak is good. Limited is fast, predictable, optimizable, good for tooling.<p>GSS goes too far.",1397251298

Raymond -- believe that it is superior on <i>technical</i> grounds, the &quot;many eyes make all bugs shallow&quot; theory. They tend to disregard ideology and instead believe OS is the rational decision of those who want technically better software. In my opinion this is not always true, as Heartbleed shows (but then again who knows how many undisclosed vulnerabilities are there in existing proprietary software! At least now we know about Heartbleed!)<p>Free Software advocates -- such as Richard Stallman and the FSF -- believe it&#x27;s a matter of <i>ideology</i>. This has little to do with technical quality. They say &quot;sure, if the software is better that&#x27;s a plus, but freedom is a matter of <i>principle</i> to us&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not a zealot but I tend to side with the Free Software camp, and I don&#x27;t see how the OpenSSL fiasco undermines their ideology.<p>PS: I also take issue with the &quot;paid security researcher&quot; remark.

I&#x27;ve got the exact verbage wrong, but that was the sentiment (this was several years ago).  It was quite a hard sell from the solicitor, and I didn&#x27;t go for it.  I was frankly a little disgusted by the call.<p>That said, I&#x27;ve been driving for 20 years, and pulled over one time.  That one time, an out of state cop (in my home town) pulled me over because the license plate frame (from the dealership I bought the car at) partially obscured the state name and he couldn&#x27;t tell what it was. I suppose it could have been another state that ended in -nois, like lilinois, iiiinois, or something else, but more than likely, it was 5AM in a small town in Maine and I was circling around one-way streets looking lost or suspicious (I hadn&#x27;t been back there in many years).  The cop gave me directions to the street my grandfather lived on, and told me to enjoy my trip.<p>The secret here is surprisingly simple, and applies to most everything else in life.  Don&#x27;t be a dick.  Drive around the same speed as other cars, and if you&#x27;re the only one on the road, don&#x27;t do more than 5-6 mph over the limit on the highway.  It won&#x27;t cost you that much time, and if you&#x27;re the only one on the road it&#x27;s probably dark and/or rural anyway so you SHOULD be more cautious, and in the end, you win either way, at the great expense of.. a few minutes time.<p>Another tip I&#x27;ve learned, is do as others do - especially on highways.  Think about it, when you&#x27;re driving across country, how many other cars around you are undertaking that length of a trip?  It&#x27;s far more likely most of them live in the area, and know what&#x27;s appropriate - both for safety, and for cop-avoidance.",1397250878

To perform that function, they&#x27;ve spent the past ~60 years building up cryptanalytic capability (pretty much unmatched by any other single organization either governmental or private).<p>Because of this, they have a secondary function, which is to serve as subject-matter-experts for other government agencies. They provide advice, mainly in the form of influencing NIST standards (overtly by providing recommendations, and as we&#x27;ve come to learn, covertly by fucking with standards). This is a side-effect of their primary function however.<p>Asimov&#x27;s first law of the NSA is to intercept and process signals intelligence. Any other function is secondary, and certainly will not take precedence over their first function.<p>What the Snowden revelations have shown, is that there&#x27;s a conflict of interest between their primary function and being tasked with providing advice. I think it&#x27;s a reasonable argument to be had that they probably should get out of the business of providing guidance to other agencies, as now all that advice is tainted.<p>The security of &quot;US-based companies&quot; is so far down the list of priorities that I hesitate to suggest it exists at all. Reporting vulnerabilities to vendors is at best orthogonal to their primary function, and at worst, counter to it. If you want to argue that someone in the government should be responsible for helping companies fix security issues, that&#x27;s also a good argument. But it certainly shouldn&#x27;t be the NSA (and definitely not now that we know they have no compulsion about misleading everyone).<p>I&#x27;m going to ignore your side-note about JS browser-based crypto.

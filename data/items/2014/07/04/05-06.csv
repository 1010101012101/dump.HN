7987535,comment,7983124,7987262,1,0,sliverstorm,,,"I guess my theory partly depends on the filter being too sophisticated for any one person to co-opt. We can design machine learning, but there can&#x27;t be many people who are capable of wrapping their head around a running machine learning system, and be able to reach in <i>right here</i> and peek/poke some weight and <i>bam</i> your nephew is arrested in Texas. On the bright side, most of those people are probably not officers, whom you seem to be most afraid of.<p>As for the objectivity of feeding the filter data, I envision something completely automatic. No selective entry for this or that suspicious person- the filter is fed a database of all people, and perhaps monitors the internet&#x27;s traffic on its own. Maybe ACH traffic too. Financial crime could be this system&#x27;s biggest win- computers are <i>way</i> more suited to uncovering financial crime relative to humans.<p>Basically, when it&#x27;s big enough and sophisticated enough and automated enough that no one person can fully understand it, it becomes significantly harder to pervert. And, as I mentioned before, it needn&#x27;t be perfect- our current system is pervertable too (see: papers please, racial profiling, etc), so this one would just need to be less pervertable...",1404453595

For example, if you are charging 0.00015 BTC, the amount 0.00015001 and 0.00015002 may be used to distinguish two payments. These amounts are cycled every ~15 mins.<p>Edit: Also, I may add support for BIP32 master public keys in the future. This would allow derivation of child public keys on behalf of the user, providing a unique payment address for each transaction.

Generators seem to be billed (ironically by TJ amongst others with his Koa project) as the solution to callback hell but, having tried Go, I got the same felling that actors are much easier to reason about and debug (although concurrency is still hard).<p>On the client side, web workers allow parallelism but the API is inconvenient to use: you need to have a file for each web worker whereas Go&#x27;s `go` routines are akin to a function call. In addition to this standardized conundrum, you have browsers discrepancies with the APIs available inside a worker varying between vendors [1].<p>On node, you have the cluster API, which allows managing several processes so it&#x27;s even further from light threads. On the bright side, most (all?) APIs have both a sync and async version.<p>As a result, there&#x27;s nothing you can use for multithreading in a module without coordinating with the whole project. I think JavaScript needs language support for light threads, not APIs for multiprocessing.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker/Functions_and_classes_available_to_workers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker/Func...</a>",1404453120

7987474,comment,7986612,7986612,1,0,owenversteeg,,,"TL;DR Neither this blog post, the Elm website or Elm&#x27;s example sites have a good example of something laid out well with Elm (all break horribly badly when resized.) Also, If people actually learned CSS, they would have a much easier time.<p>Firstly, I find it hilarious that when I opened this blog post dissing CSS the author&#x27;s &#x27;responsive&#x27; design was completely and utterly fucked. I opened the page at 50% width and 100% height on a laptop, and I was confronted with a bunch of unrelated text taking up literally the entire fold. By resizing my browser I found out that the hideous thing taking up my entire browser window was what would be the sidebar if I expanded my browser further. I then go to the Elm website and am presented with a site that&#x27;s not responsive at all, and I take a look at some &quot;example sites&quot; built with Elm and I get this[0] site, which breaks in a ridiculous fashion when resized. Hell, if you&#x27;re designing a layout language and you can&#x27;t even point to one example where it works I&#x27;ll really start to question it.<p>Secondly, I think that the vast majority of &#x27;problems&#x27; people have with CSS would be solved if people just learnt it as they would a programming language. All the time I hear &quot;CSS is so frustrating!&quot; from people that write code in other languages just fine but don&#x27;t know CSS. Well, just learn it! Most people don&#x27;t care about learning CSS, and only copy-and-paste from Stack Overflow. You wouldn&#x27;t copy-and-paste every single line of code from Stack Overflow for your C++ application, so why do you do it with CSS? I actually took the time to learn CSS a while ago, and it&#x27;s been much easier to write it since. I have only had one problem in the past few years with CSS specifically: vertical centering and browser inconsistencies. I&#x27;d say having only two major problems for a language that&#x27;s been designed around browser politics is excellent.<p>[0] <a href=""http://library.elm-lang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://library.elm-lang.org/</a>",1404452002

For example:<p>* How do you vertically center an arbitrary element inside another where you don&#x27;t know the height of any of them? Answer: The only reliable way is via &quot;display: table-cell&quot;. It has several annoying limitations.<p>* How do you ensure that several horizontally adjacent boxes fill the width of the container and are all of equal height, regardless of their contents? Answer: Table again, but it&#x27;s not always possible without JS because of how height percentages are calculated. (Also, all browsers including Chrome implement &quot;height: 100%&quot; differently.)<p>* How, given N elements arranged horizontally next to each other, do you ensure that they (1) fill the width of the container, (2) if they become too narrow (ie. min-width), any element(s) that don&#x27;t fit will wrap below? (Note: Rule #1 must apply; when one element doesn&#x27;t fit, the preceding &quot;line&quot; must expand to fit the full width of the container.) Answer: Not possible in CSS alone.<p>* How do you ensure that an element (eg., an image) of arbitrary width is always has the same height as it&#x27;s width? (For example, imagine a grid which should expand to fit the window, and all cells should be quadratic.) Answer: With images, possible with an unintuitive &quot;height: 0; padding-bottom: 100%&quot; hack, not for other elements without JS.<p>* How do you center an absolutely positioned element of arbitrary width and height (think tooltip or speech balloon)? Answer: JS.<p>* How do absolutely position an element without specifying a width, so that the width becomes the minimum needed to display all of its contents up to a max-width? For example, a box saying &quot;Hello&quot; should take up the space required by that word and no more. Answer: Not possible in CSS alone, although you would have thought that &quot;display: inline-block&quot; would work. Firefox actually does it, Chrome/WebKit don&#x27;t.<p>* How do you have an absolute element be the same width as another element? For example, a drop down menu should be at least the width of its menu item, and an autocomplete box should at least be the width of its input box. Answer: JS.<p>* How do ensure a label is vertically centered on the same text baseline as an adjacent textarea? Answer: Textareas are considered blocks, not text, so you cannot without computing the baseline and using padding or negative margins, and that is imprecise.<p>These are just a few basic real-world layout challenges. They should not be challenges, they should be simple to implement, but CSS doesn&#x27;t help; it gets in the way more than it aids. In some cases, inconsistent browser implementations result in wildly different rendering. The result is JavaScript to fill the holes, and sometimes just to say &quot;screw this, I will do in code&quot;.",1404451414

Value is such a indeterminate notion that anyone could be said to be creating it, but so many activities we take for granted (and which render us service) are parasitic in some sense - taking rent, opening a store of any kind, transporting goods,  paying interest, manufacturing goods are all based on taking advantage of a gap between buyer/seller or taking advantage of an inherent advantage of scale/capital (ownership of the means of production if you like). I think it&#x27;s ok not to add any value other than getting a service/product to someone who wants it and doesn&#x27;t want to spend energy looking for it. That&#x27;s not what makes these companies regrettable.<p><i>Google can earn $60 billion in revenue per year because they create even more value than that for its users and customers.</i><p>Google is, strictly speaking, a middleman just like the companies above, it doesn&#x27;t create significant value for end users with advertising (its primary source of revenue), that might even be a negative for customers. Google lives in the interstices between customers/customer data and advertisers and the value they create is mostly incidental to their main revenue stream (it is in services like gmail, gmaps, android etc), and designed carefully to ring-fence customers or guide them toward being the end product of advertising streams. Again, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s bad, but it&#x27;s important to recognise that and its similarity to the activities of these other companies or others like Amazon or Apple which provide useful services at the same time as making money as middlemen. They could easily earn $60 billion a year by being evil, and we might not even notice if they were at first because we&#x27;re too busy enjoying the nice free presents.<p>The problem with the companies in this article I think, and any other company gone bad, is that the interests of consumer and customer become misaligned to such an extent that the company no longer serves its customers in the sense of seeing to their needs, but in the sense of serving them up to others.",1404450335

If you&#x27;re using amp-hours, you <i>must also</i> know the voltage!&quot;, as if this is an otherwise irrelevant detail. The exact same people pinging me would have an equally apopepltic fit if I said &quot;just hook up any old battery, voltage is unimportant, as long as you&#x27;ve got a lot of joules!&quot;.",1404450181

Generators are a safer, forwards-compatible choice for doing async work. That&#x27;s why there is little support in the community for adopting fibers.<p>The big issue with generators is making sense of stack traces while debugging. And due to the nature of how generators work we&#x27;ll probably need an fairly creative solution here. I&#x27;m fine with generators today, but it would be better if await sugar landed sooner.",1404450041

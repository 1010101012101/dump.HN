The world is everything that is the case. *
1.1	
The world is the totality of facts, not of things.
1.11	
The world is determined by the facts, and by these being all the facts.
1.12	
For the totality of facts determines both what is the case, and also all that is not the case.
1.13	
The facts in logical space are the world.
1.2	
The world divides into facts.
1.21	
Any one can either be the case or not be the case, and everything else remain the same.",1229828330

405111,comment,402109,404922,0,0,sadfsa,,,"I'll answer the questions in order:<p>1: If humans lost all technology today, the vast majority of them would die off within a month, because only modern, high-energy farming can get enough food out of the ground to feed them. However, this high-energy farming is only possible because of oil, which not only transports the food, but provides the pesticides without which insects would be eating instead of humans. (Another finite, nonrenewable natural resource with no possible substitute provides fertilizer, without which our food wouldn't even grow).<p>2: Because, like other species before them, humans are destined to exhaust the resources on which they depend.<p>3: Nothing has been created (IOW, entropy has not decreased, and matter and energy are still conserved)-- we're merely better at transforming matter and energy than we used to be.<p>4: Before our developed energy resources were built, they existed as undeveloped energy resources and raw materials. For example, oil drills are made of steel from the ground, not steel magicked into existence, and they are built to remove oil from the ground, not to create oil out of thoughts.<p>4a: Since the aforementioned resources are finite, they are most certainly running out. The only scientific theory on the timing was formulated by one M. King Hubbert in the 1950s.<p>4c: <i>General</i> entropy is irrelevant. We're still over a trillion years away from seeing the entire universe burn out. The entropy of <i>this planet</i>, WRT its ability to sustain an ever-increasing human population, is increasing rapidly, as evidenced by global warming, desertification, deforestation, and other very obvious symptoms.<p>5: Yes, humans are running out of general resources (because they are <i>finite</i>) to transform into security-enhancing resources. No, humans are not running out of chaos, they are creating plenty of it: Polluted drinking water, fishless oceans, coalless coal mines, a toxic atmosphere, and dry oil fields (among other things) are all perfectly useless to our security. Eventually, there isn't going to be anything left but rocks and mud, and then the situation I described in (1) above will exist.<p>5a: 100,000 years is not a long time compared to the length of the history of life on Earth. There have been other species that lasted longer, but are gone today.",1229828168

There's still a startup feel to the company. This is manifested in the intensity with which we work and in our rather frugal approach to spending money on fancy office furniture and other frivolous things.<p>There's a really deep technological core to the company. I remember an occasion which took place just a few weeks after I started there which really made this clear to me. An engineer benchmarked an ""a"" and a ""b"" distribution of the same version of the Linux kernel. ""a"" was 5% faster and he took the time to figure out exactly why this was the case and to see why this had happened. When you are running hundreds or thousands of servers,a 5% performance degradation can alter your cost structure significantly.<p>We have fun by doing great work. There may be a foosball table or two somewhere in the organization, but by and large our energy is focused on doing a great job for our customers.<p>Every company likes to claim that they are customer-driven. That is truly the case at Amazon. If you do something heroic to help a customer in need, you may even be recognized in front of your peers at your team's next all-hands gathering.<p>Creative problem solving is encouraged, but it is most likely going to happen within the space of your team.<p>Reasoned, fact-driven arguments prevail in meetings and in the overall decision-making process. You won't get too far with an argument that starts out with ""I am guessing that..."" If you do your homework, collect up the facts, and have genuine numbers to back up your hunches, you will do great.<p>As a developer you will be on pager duty 1/N of the time, where N is the number of developers on your team. After some piece of code wakes you up at 3 AM twice in the same week, you'll figure out that it is a weak link in the chain and you'll figure out how to strengthen it. This continuous improvement process helps us to make our systems more and more reliable over time. Of course, sometimes the fix is to rearchitect. Figure it out, put the plan together and make it happen.<p>We do have a ""get it done"" approach. There's nowhere to hide and no room for slackers or pretenders. Working in our environment tends to weed out those kinds of people pretty quickly.<p>Benefits are good and once you've proven yourself the pay is good too.<p>Like I said, I have been at Amazon for 6.5 years.

405081,comment,404707,404707,0,0,gambling8nt,,,"The argument in this essay relies heavily on, among other things, the idea that extraordinarily abstract mathematical discussions are similar to extraordinarily abstract discussions in philosophy or literary theory.  This premise (among the others refuted throughout this post) is flawed; while some of mathematics is not yet related to any applied field, that is because applied fields develop by using the mathematics available.  Furthermore, unlike the linguistic gymnastics of much of philosophy and literary criticism, the abstractions used in mathematics have meanings that can be explained concretely in simpler terms.  Anything published in a mathematical paper is either incontrovertibly true, contains some equally incontrovertible flaw, or is a conjecture after such a result.  That mathematics contains this level of rigor is precisely why it avoids the contention against which fields such as literary criticism and philosophy fall--namely, that of containing form without substance.",1229825423

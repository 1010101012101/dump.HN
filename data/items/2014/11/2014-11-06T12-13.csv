8566770,comment,8565011,8565564,0,0,gabemart,,,"Your analysis is extremely one-sided in favor of producers and against consumers.<p>In economics, the difference between the maximum a consumer is willing to pay for a certain good and the the actual price charged is called &quot;consumer surplus&quot;. For example, if I buy an apple for $0.50 but the maximum I would have payed is $1.25, I enjoy $0.75 of consumer surplus.<p>Essentially what you are proposing is that consumer surplus should always optimally be zero. That in a perfect world, every producer would charge each consumer exactly their maximum willingness to pay for each good.<p>But just as there is consumer surplus, there is producer surplus. Producer surplus is the difference between the minimum price they would be willing to sell a good for and the actual price they sell that good for. So, as an apple producer, if the lowest price I could profitably sell an apple for is $0.10 but I actually sell if for $0.50, I enjoy $0.40 of consumer surplus.<p>In traditional free-market models, at an equilibrium price there is a mixture of consumer and producer surplus. Consumers buy things for a bit less than their maximum willingness to pay, and producers sell things for a bit more than their rock-bottom just-marginally-profitable price.<p>In your model of perfect price discrimination, there is a huge shift in surplus from consumers to producers. Yes, it&#x27;s efficient in terms of allocation. But there&#x27;s a huge loss in utility for consumers.",1415278654

If they were, they wouldn&#x27;t be able to go jurisdictional shopping so easily.<p>Taxation without representation is pretty widely recognised as problematic though. Not for nothing did it help trigger the war of independence against in the colonies against the British. Think about it: if you can&#x27;t influence politicians in any way, what stops them taxing 100% of your labour? The only thing that stops governments doing this at the moment is the fear of consequences from their citizens: either at the ballot box in democracies or at the hands of the mob in dictatorships. Companies can&#x27;t vote and they can&#x27;t rebel, so there has to be <i>some</i> kind of pressure that pushes back against ever higher taxation. Usually this is indirect: countries fear that if they tax companies too much, they&#x27;ll go bust, people will lose their jobs, and then those people will vote.<p>But when companies are largely distributed and a government doesn&#x27;t feel any real exposure via their own population, the natural tendency is to say &quot;if you want to sell to our citizens, you have to pay us lots of tax&quot; and there&#x27;s not much a company can do about it except simply deny an entire population their services, which is about as useful a response as a person deciding the best way to lower their tax bill is to throw themselves off a bridge. Nobody wins in this situation!<p>> In my view, companies (and their investors) have the privilege of being able to profit by providing services to citizens, and they should pay (be taxed) for this privilege.<p>Since when is the ability to make a profit by engaging in trade a &quot;privilege&quot;? People were doing that in the earliest tribes and farming settlements where the closest thing to a government was the local alpha male. The privilege of taxation is one people grant to governments in return for the stability and ability to make long term plans that they provide; but that privilege can be revoked and has been throughout history.",1415278597

8566659,comment,8566436,8566647,0,0,mike_hearn,,,"Well, this problem is fundamental to trying to tax entities that don&#x27;t have any specific location. Taxing people is quite simple because you can&#x27;t split a person up - just count the days they reside in a particular tax jurisdiction and once it goes over a certain number of days per year, you say &quot;you are resident here, benefiting from our services, so pay us tax&quot; and as long as that number of days per year is reasonable, it all sort of works. And it feels fair(ish) because people can vote, so they get to control what their tax money is spent on, modulo lots of handwaving about how we all use insufficiently good voting systems.<p>A company though, can be split up and spread around, and many modern companies operate almost everywhere and yet nowhere in particular. That&#x27;s very true of internet companies that don&#x27;t need any local presence to operate in a country. Additionally they are seen as ideal tax targets by politicians because they can&#x27;t vote, and are often perceived as &quot;foreign&quot; even if the reality is rather more complex, and people perceive tax on corporations to be free as the price increases that it (theoretically) results in can&#x27;t be distinguished from general price rises due to inflation.<p>So we end up in a messy situation that suits nobody. Big companies exploit their trans-national nature to try and get taxed in places that don&#x27;t really need the money like Luxembourg. Big countries try and exploit their size to extract as much money as possible from the evil foreign capitalists, regardless of where they may actually be based. Companies get taxed without representation and we just sort of ignore this because we feel they can already buy too much influence with politicians anyway, even without them actually getting to vote on anything.<p>And in the end, governments still don&#x27;t have enough money.<p>Economists who study this problem sometimes conclude that the best rate to set corporation tax at is zero; they argue that &quot;dead weight costs&quot; of corporation taxes are very high compared to most taxes and besides, ultimately the costs get passed on to consumers. Of course this ignores the fact that business is global but taxation and voting is still very local.

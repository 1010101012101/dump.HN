Sorry for the lack of specific examples, but my way of dealing with the incessant irritations is to deliberately forget them.<p>Even the performance is misleading. It comes from one thing, the static typing, and having played that card there doesn't seem to be anywhere else for them to go. AVM2 bytecode is very interesting; if you try to optimize it you get counterintuitive results: it either stays the same or gets slower. (The one exception is the fast memory opcodes that were added for the abortive Alchemy project, but that's another story.)<p>The proper point of comparison is V8. Adobe had an eternity of a head start. They just bet on the wrong horse. Had they understood the problem more deeply they could have grabbed the V8 guys before Google even thought about it. In that case their head start might have turned into total dominance of the browser runtime. The biggest advantage Flash has -- 95%+ market penetration -- is one of the most valuable assets on the internet. (Is any single asset more valuable? I mean executables, as in IE counts but google.com doesn't.) Imagine if Adobe had done V8 before Chrome existed. The few users who didn't have Flash would have had to install it just to make web apps usable. People might not have bothered for a 2x speedup, but a 1000x speedup? I think so.<p>Edit: to be clear, I'm not talking about (heaven forbid) Flash apps. I'm saying that Flash could have become the standard runtime for <i>web</i> apps. They were on the VM performance track years before anyone else. But it's easy to see that they weren't thinking about this at all, because the facilities for communicating between Flash and the browser are unbelievably poor. (They actually marshal all calls into XML messages! Grrrrrrraaaaaaagh.)",1287257684

The crux being that people have either accepted those random causes of death, or they feel that they have enough control to avoid them (even if that isn't true). Terrorist attacks (though rare on American soil) are something that people have not (yet) accepted as unavoidable, or are something that they feel they have control over avoiding.<p>The following also contributed:<p>- The attack was perpetrated by Muslims against a predominantly Christian country. Especially a country with a lot of 'born-again'/Evangelical Christians that are rabidly religious. This helps to form a ""Us vs. Them"" mentality as well as a ""They are attacking our way of life; our very identity."" I have a strong feeling that the reaction would be less severe (though maybe not by much) if it had been perpetrated by members of another religion (or at least people that didn't use their religion as a reason for their actions).<p>- The attack was perpetrated by a group. A group that has members that are still 'at large.' (i.e. ""It could/will happen again."") By contrast, the Oklahoma City Bombing was easy to dismiss as some random crazy guy.<p>- It came from outside of the country. If the attack had been from a group that was based in the US (i.e. some political group that resorted to terrorism), then the reaction probably wouldn't have been so severe. It's easier for form an ""Us vs Them"" mentality when there is a greater distinction between ""us"" and ""them."" If the people behind the attacks were Americans, people would still be outraged, but it would be a hell of a lot easier for them to picture those people as just 'crazies.' I think that a number of people also view Arabs/Muslims as 'below' them (i.e. ""a bunch of rag-heads living out in the middle of god-forsaken desert"") even if they consider themselves to be more enlightened than that.",1287257459

Is has been very slow to advance, very conservative when advancing, and the tools are still so slow (At least eclipse).<p>Regarding GUI development on Silverlight. Microsoft has done many things right with it. It has the best separation of UI and logic that I have seen built right into it. They have xml files to represent the UI (In the same way web has HTML), and the framework is as flexibly as could be (e.g. it wouldn't take you more than a minute to create a scrollbar that looks like a clock for example (If you have the graphics ready).<p>And the most important of all - they have a UI editor built for DESIGNERS. It encourages you to worry about the UI look and feel, and not on the logic behind it. It has tools in it from the designers world, and encapsulate a lot of headaches (E.g. setting a gradient direction is done by dragging a line over the area, and not by setting some numbers).<p>In addition, Silverlight has the advantage of being a second generation after WPF. Microsoft has learned from its mistakes with WPF, and simplified Silverlight dramatically. They could do that because Silverlight was a new technology which didn't have the requirement to be backward compatible.",1287255821

(not)  Now this friend hadn't known this friend for long, but he assured me that his friend would love to hear about my startup.

Come to find out, he has been tried, convicted and sentenced in 11 counts of SEC fraud earning him 22 months in the clink.  Not someone I would be interested in funding my project.<p>I am not saying that all angel/VC's are bad.  Far from it.

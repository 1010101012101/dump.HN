I wasn't saying that they weren't working on it at that point.<p>My point was that of course they've been working on it, but it was not possible to have completed it and released it in 2008. If it had been, some other company would have done it; so far though, both with phones and with tablet computers, Apple hardware (at least in the US, not talking about Japan) seems to be right on the edge of what is possible - all the modern touch-screen phones [droid, pre, nexus, motorola, etc] started coming out after the iPhone release; same as we will now see with all the new tablets.<p>Of course one could argue that the other manufacturers just weren't sure of the market, and only rushed in to fill in the gaps after Apple has proven that there is a demand for that kind of hardware, but I don't think that's realistic - if it was technically feasible for HP or Microsoft to release a kick-ass tablet before Apple, I'm sure they would've jumped at the chance. They hadn't.<p>As to changing his mind - that was referring to his statements from 2003, and I am saying that in that time his statements were reasonable.

Seriously though, politically active people love this kind of stuff and although the number of people who like to pore over such data is small they also love posting their findings which will result in regular waves - not many sticky users, but you can probably pick up some revenue by CPI ads or beachcombing the serious users with a freemium model.<p>The trick (if it doesn't consume too much in the way of resources) is to join up the disparate information - even though interested researchers could use your site and existing contributions databases to do so now, you'll only get a footnote credit. If there's a nice way to cross-reference the 13f data with other things, then they'll send people directly there, and a percentage of them will surf around and then announce discoveries of their own in a me-too fashion.<p>The reasons I think of political campaign contributions as a cross-reference: political people tend to be obsessed; they're usually quite partisan, so once they've found a resource they like such as yours, they tend to be loyal to it; election cycles, like SEC declarations, take place on a fixed schedule and are thus predictable (in terms of adwords or external marketing); interest is growing in this issue after January's Supreme Court decision to remove limits on corporate campaign spending.<p>Regarding maps, everyone likes them and they're more accessible than tables. but I'm also thinking of more abstract maps, like using processing.js or something to do dynamic node-based diagrams that would make it easy for people to surf the data without consuming much in the way of server resources. I love spreadsheets myself but that's because I'm OK at number crunching - for most people it's the equivalent of trying to make a picture using a mouse and  MS Paint vs a tablet and Adobe Illustrator.",1272649503

You have a clear conversion goal--get users interested in your services and contact you--but to accomplish it it falls to users to first choose to click through your menu. You should have clear calls to action, starting from the landing page: ""See what we do"" or a couple recently finished projects, and make it easy and compelling for potential clients to contact you directly from project detail pages. I'm sure your newsletter is also a good conversion path--you could integrate into the projects section as well: ""Learn more about this site in our newsletter! Click to subscribe!"" I'd put your phone number in the footer too, and perhaps investigate a click-to-call implementation.<p>From a user-experience perspective I'd make sure every clickable element is clearly actionable (links to Facebook/Twitter/LinkedIn don't look like links) and has a hover state, consider Fitt's law (e.g. the ""Web"" and ""Print"" links on the Work panel are incredibly important, but awfully small), and validate submissions on your contact form. From an implementation perspective, the way elements scroll in on each panel is a little jumpy--maybe that's intentional, but it looks rough. From a tech perspective I'd be more impressed if you'd chosen to use @font-face instead of image-replacement, but that's a little silly.<p>What does ""Your Piece of the Web"" mean?

The system I built tracked every time I viewed a stock and let me put notes in there, so I could remember why I looked at it the first time.

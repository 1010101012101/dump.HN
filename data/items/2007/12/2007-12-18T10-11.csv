90700,comment,90500,90631,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"You may get real-world news, but it's most-likely news of a certain political nature. It's obvious to me (if not others) that places like Slashdot are completely different _political_ sites than they were say five years ago. The topic matter may be close, but the nature of the way articles are presented, commented on, and ranked is completely different. It used to be you got great intellectual comments from all sides of the spectrum. Now that sort of disucssion is down-modded and in its place you get basically political sloganeering masquerading as comments.<p>
In terms of general subject matter, sure, the Daily Me is probably not happening. What's happening in its place is a sort of Daily Political Me, where whatever is ""hot"" is filtered one way or another based on general political views of the site. This is a natural consequence of user-ranking.",1197974321

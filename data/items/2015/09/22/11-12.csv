It&#x27;s still not a complete replacement for cython (and I don&#x27;t think it ever will or intends to be), but for hot spot numerical calculations it&#x27;s really nice since it&#x27;s much faster to test things out since it doesn&#x27;t involve the boiler plate required by Cython, and doesn&#x27;t require the (often slow) compilation times.<p>In Numba 0.21.0, on-disk caching of jit&#x27;d code was also introduced, which was one of the major sticking points for us to put Numba into production in areas where we needed faster start-up times. Before we could really only use Cython because we required the start-up times available only from AOT compilation.<p>That all said, Numba has been a bit buggy for me at times, although these get squashed pretty quickly. I&#x27;ve only found a single bug in Cython in all of the years I&#x27;ve been using it, and it&#x27;s amazing how quickly Robert Bradshaw or Stefan Behnel respond and fix things considering Cython is not their full time job.",1442921284

People talk about Linux as the break away from the Windows and Mac OS crowd, but let&#x27;s face it, it is all the same thing running on Von Neuman architecture hardware. There are people trying to build machines from scratch to run their own OS on. I hope somebody succeeds.

Several times. Never followed.<p>And last but not least, the accident could have been prevented, but has been badly handled.

Fallout could be dispersed over an area thousands of miles wide.<p>The worst case scenario for an accident at a solar power plant or a wind farm - nothing like that.<p>Today&#x27;s nuclear power plants are inherently unsafe. Most that are in operation depend on active cooling systems to prevent a meltdown. If these cooling systems are interrupted for any reason (e.g.: power failure, loss of coolant, pump breakdown, loss of pressure control, control rod failure, backup power source failure, control systems failure, natural disaster, attack, etc.) - even for a short period of time - then the fissile material will likely overheat the reactor and result in a core meltdown.<p>Sheer luck prevented a catastrophe in the case of the 2006 electrical failure at the Forsmark plant in Sweden. Two of the four backup power systems failed to activate [1].<p>Switching the emtire world&#x27;s energy consumption over to safe, renewable energy sources would only take 20 years and cost $100 trillion (money which would be spent anyway on non-renewable energy infrastructure) [2].

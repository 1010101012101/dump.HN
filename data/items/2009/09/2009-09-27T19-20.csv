My friend and I put no work into it after launching it, because we didn't think it was interesting, but I'm able to raise attention to things pretty quickly. (Even without putting in effort, some money was made—we opened up a shitty Cafepress account and put a link on, and sold a handful of shirts and mousepads.)<p>This month, as an experiment, I started a blog without any publicizing, to see how well I could grow something without any promotion. Three weeks in I have over a hundred readers and am currently growing at the rate of seven or eight readers a day. Now I'm experimenting with a collective, because I want to see how well I can divert those readers towards other people if I care to.<p>I know it's out of fashion to say this, but I believe in the long tail. I'm able to publish anything I can imagine without consulting other people first, and if I can find a thousand people to buy whatever it is I'm making, then perhaps I'm not yet rich, but I'm financially free to do what I like. I've still got three years, and I'm utterly confident of finding an audience.<p><i>I think you'll find that as you continue on in your area, the competition grows significantly.</i><p>I'm curious. Competition with who? I don't know anybody who writes the way I do, or makes things look the way I do, or plays music how I do, or takes photos the way I do. Art's a great field in that there's no competition unless you go the route of searching for grants and entering contests, and I dislike both. I'd never live a lifestyle that relied on the good will of a panel of judges—though if it comes down to it, I can compete.",1254081168

Its slow reflexes — closely following its slow response to a controversy that forced the resignation of Van Jones, a White House adviser — suggested that it has trouble dealing with stories arising from the polemical world of talk radio, cable television and partisan blogs. Some stories, lacking facts, never catch fire. But others do, and a newspaper like The Times needs to be alert to them or wind up looking clueless or, worse, partisan itself.""<p>I, too, hope that there will be more disclosure on the story as they are fairly serious allegations and it would be helpful to know the sample sizes of the report - but what I find surprising is how non-curious those like the NYT were - and they're admitting as much.<p>They seem to have entirely ignored the story or attacked those doing the reporting as opposed to digging up facts for themselves.  This reinforces the point not only that we need more investigations like this but that we can't rely on traditional media outlets for these stories.  As the NYT notes, sure, sometimes these stories just turn out to be unsubstantiated polemics - but that doesn't necessarily make them wrong.",1254080212

(Fortunately, today, one can query quite a bit of data at <a href=""http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov</a> though there may still be a GIGO).<p>Specifically, I'm uncomfortable with denominators used in such statistics, as they appear to assume consistent driving patterns within a certain ""class"" of cars. (Is there a study which shows this?) For example, the denominator of units of a model in operation is deceptive, if one model is driven far more than another, or, perhaps, rather, that one model is overwhelmingly favored by those who drive more less.<p>I have, admittedly, begged defining what driving ""more"" or ""less"" means. It seems that miles traveled is commonly accepted, but overall time spent traveling may be equally, if not more, meaningful. Sadly, this latter information isn't readily available, contributing to the GIGO problem. Even person-mile data are elusive.<p>Since the ""nonmotorist"" number of fatalities shown by the FARS front page (""Sub Total2"") is around one sixth the total, this could easily mask differences in safety between models, since, presumably, car safety features are, first and foremost, for the protection of the occupants, not nonmotorists (or motorcyclists).<p>Back to the (sub-)topic at hand, my biggest take-away is that the Pinto was not defective or inherently unsafe, as it did not burst into flames on its own, nor is a cost-benefit analysis (which requires putting a price tag on human injury and death when it comes to safety features) reprehensible. Instead, such an analysis is necessary and beneficial.<p>The most important concept here is risk. How systems behave ""in the wild,"" especially when human users/operators are part of these systems, is far from a certainty. This is the uncertainty is the basis of the polish vs. ship tension, as well as, apparently, the basis for negligence jurisprudence.<p>That I consider the whole Pinto debacle to be primarily about imposed versus consented risk on the part of the purchaser might make this whole sub-thread irrelevant to the OP's topic, but I think a contrast would be instructive in any case.<p>Regardless, I personally do not believe it is up to an engineer to make a risk analysis. Rather, I am a firm believer in more ""sunshine"" on such information, despite the current practice of graffitying products with warning labels.",1254078078

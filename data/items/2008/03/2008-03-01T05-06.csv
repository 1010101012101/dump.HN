And yeah, there's a new generation that's prosperous on relatively less effort, but have you taken a look at Silicon Valley lately?<p>Unless you believe that the American innovation engine is also slowing, you don't have a lot of reasons to believe that we won't see more and more innovation coming out of India. In fact, if there's a crash in outsourcing, it might accelerate that process (or simply shift the outsourcing market to target Europe).",1204350158

126567,comment,126361,126361,0,0,elq,,,"> ""we never had to deal with sharding the index across multiple servers or a hash table of words that wouldn’t fit in memory. Speaking of which, I’d love to read some papers on how internet-scale search engines actually do that. Does anyone have any recommendations?""<p>I can speak from experience on a very large search engine (not on a google scale in # of docs, but within an order of magnitude - and google scale in terms of qps [estimated - google doesn't publish such numbers])<p>Re: ""sharding the index across multiple servers"" - every document has an id, mod the id against some number (preferably much larger than the number of partitions/shards you have), split you index servers into N clusters, assign mods to a cluster (do so in a way that you avoid hotspots), have a ""query aggregator"" that sends an incoming query to one server in every partition. the aggregator then merges the result sets and resorts based on a sort key passed by the search node.<p>Re: ""hash table of words that wouldn’t fit in memory"" - the vocabulary I had to work with included at least 7 (human) languages with _many_ artificial words. The # of hash entries tended to hover around 2.7M tokens. How, do not include numbers in the index (there's an infinite number of them :)), ignore case, and tokenization. Tokenization is relatively easy except for CJK languages for that either have fluent/native speakers define the tokenizing semantics or find/buy a library.",1204349508

I chortled when I saw that line, and mumbled to myself ""I used LAMP in 2000...""<p>I've only slowly realized how trivial it is to stay several years ahead of the ""enterprise"".  Stuff people at Hacker News consider old hat by now (Rails, say, or Django) will be big news in the enterprise a couple years from now.  Then a few years after that will come excitement about Erlang, and Scala, and Seaside...",1204349284

126563,comment,123071,124739,0,0,xirium,,,"I've read a lot of ELisp code, and I have very rarely seen the equivalent of Ruby-style monkey patching. Even the advice mechanism, an AOP-like feature which enables functions to be dynamically wrapped and chained, somewhat like Rails' alias_method_chain, is used sparingly. Instead, every mature Emacs extension exposes a plethora of ""hooks"", extension points that other packages can attach their own handlers to. Other packages add their handlers to these hooks, and to hooks that the core Emacs code provides, and thus they cooperate largely without collisions. -- <a href=""http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2008/02/never-complain-only-ever-code.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2008/02/never-complain-only...</a>",1204348855

It kind of scrambles your brain a bit, and I lost my ability to qwerty for a moment there. With time I started typing quicker in both dvorak, and qwerty again.<p>Can you talk a bit more about using the tablet as a mouse? I have a multi-monitor set up now and just noticed theres a spot on my desk for a tablet. I suppose it would have to be put into relative mode, not absolute.",1204348020

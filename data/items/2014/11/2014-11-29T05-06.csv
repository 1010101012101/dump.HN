The way to learn is to build something you want, or something you&#x27;d like to show off.  For me it was an Android app.  I knew there was Java involved, but it taught me all of the things I could never learn from just reading a book (user interactions, getting data off the network, etc).  Building my first Android app and my first Ruby on Rails website showed me &#x27;real&#x27; programming.  The funny thing is it turns out that stuff is all boilerplate rarely involves the fancy algorithms you learn first, but it&#x27;s what makes real products.<p>Since you know JavaScript, go build a mobile app with Phonegap.  You&#x27;ll get a really great rush when you see your first app pop up on an iPhone or an Android phone.  You&#x27;ll naturally want to iterate and improve, and that process will make you learn.",1417240014

There is perhaps nowhere else in the world today sporting a greater gap between the official line and the reality of popular life than mainland China.<p>Secondly, Chinese popular nutrition is still in the dark ages, its common currency being tradition, old-wives hearsay and happenstance. Things that are imported or claimed to be imported are held in high esteem for no other reason. Basic biology is barely taught.<p>I&#x27;ve been here on and off for 13 years, mostly on, and that&#x27;s most of my adult life. I was born in Australia, my wife is Chinese, and we chose to have our kid in Thailand. However, I have many friends who have had children here and in fact this morning we just visited a friend in a local hospital who had just had a C-section. Frankly, the kid was wasted looking and it seemed obvious to me that they&#x27;d scheduled the operation prematurely.<p>Thirdly, the author confuses Confucian tradition (family lineage oriented for 2000+ years) and eugenics. The benefits of coming from an aristocratic background of eating well, education and the social network that brings is recognized in all societies. Choosing not to have a child (to kill them because of genetic status) is something else entirely, and even checking the sex of your baby is outlawed here... which isn&#x27;t to say it doesn&#x27;t happen, just that it&#x27;s a lot more on the &#x27;no popularly accessible eugenics&#x27; side than the west.<p>However, there is a hint of reality in the article. The Chinese government has for decades collected the blood of foreigners visiting the country, ostensibly as a medical exam to check whether you have some life-threatening disease and may spread it about the country but obviously partly as a backslap to other countries for doing the same and partly as a money spinner. I have often supposed that database, which is certainly linked to other information about visitors such as who they are, where they come from, who their family is, where they have been and what they are nominally doing in the country, is being compiled in to a massive global genetic database for research purposes.

One person&#x27;s analogy for using code might not work for you. You have to discover what works for you on your own. Sure, keep the other analogies and things in mind, and ask yourself if you can relate, as you progress through your own journey. Everything is relative though, and your experiences are what make you unique and valuable to the community as a whole. Maybe you&#x27;re the next Bob Ross of JavaScript - we want you to be.

I suggest just visualizing some end goal of yours. You want to make a website that offers some kind of service of something? Visualize that site and break it down into chunks. Finally, dive in head first. Just start coding on it. Don&#x27;t give a single thought to whether or not it&#x27;s as good as somebody else&#x27;s code. Don&#x27;t worry about if it&#x27;s the best it could be, yet. All you need to do is connect the dots, mentally, and play with the legos.

I do tech support, and if the client doesn&#x27;t need Windows specific software or it runs perfectly under Wine I&#x27;ll set them up with Linux builds and notebooks. I have several Chromebooks I&#x27;m versed in reformatting and know they work flawlessly and on what kernel versions that happens.<p>That is not good UX for the average joe, or anyone you are just introducing to Linux. It is a UX fail and ruins impressions when people try to install Linux on arbitrary hardware and have a bad time of it. Yes, if you are a veteran and know what you are doing you can do better than the vendors, but to recommend anything else to a Linux newbie without absolute confidence in comprehensive hardware support is just ruining their first impression.",1417238322

8673144,comment,8672974,8672974,0,0,sytelus,,,"My guess is that eugenics experiments on humans would most likely turn in to disaster, not just from ethical perspective, but from the desired outcome perspective.<p>For animals, it&#x27;s routine to target a specific trait such as more milk or less aggressiveness and do planned breeding to successfully get the desired outcome. However what we forget is that those animals suffer from many side effects when their one feature is amplified out of proportion. For instance, you can successfully get dog that is super small or super large but they would suffer from severe issues such as bad eyesight or frickle bones. For humans, this gets far more complicated. The intelligence is hardly indicated by ill-defined measurements such as IQ. We don&#x27;t even dare quantify &quot;creativity&quot; and &quot;taste&quot; which are often drivers to major breakthroughs. In any case, let&#x27;s say if you do try human breeding to target these qualities and you do end  up with people with very high IQ - you can count on lots of potential side effects such as schizophrenia and other mental disorders that dominates lives of people with such out-of-proportion amplified characteristics. On the other end there is a strong argument for random trials, aka, let nature decide evolution. Most high-impact human beings, from Newton to Einstein to Hawking were not the product of other high impact human beings or even high IQ parents, for that matter. They spontaneously appeared on the scene and many times nurture played much stronger role in any case.",1417238249

At extremely high levels of intelligence the rate of extreme social disorders skyrockets up to &quot;most&quot; (I recall the cutoff for 50% happening at ~165 IQ, but it continues to rise even after that, limited primarily by our lack of data on IQs much higher). I&#x27;m not entirely sure if this analogy is appropriate, but just as organisms with more cells are more likely to produce cancer, it seems minds with more thoughts racing through them are just as damaged by some small percentage of errant thoughts (some are extreme delusions, some are just the product of the isolation of a brilliant mind growing tired of a world, retreating from it, losing touch with how to interact with excellence and subtlety, and seeing even less subtlety in the world, simply growing more tired of it, ending with many extremely intelligent people simply unable to interact with others in any normal way).",1417237835

Ideally, a software engineer is supposed to bring in engineering qualities and therefore have a good idea of reliability, scalability, safety, error handling etc. A programmer on the other hand should ideally focus on getting the best of the platform/tools. So, I see an SE to be more broader but a P to have more depth.",1391201980

It&#x27;s greatly indexed in Google even if 90% of Softonic&#x27;s pages are pure automated search pages.<p>Let me explain you their seo structure for the english version http://en.softonic.com/.<p>Let&#x27;s start from download pages.<p>They are all subdomains where the string before &quot;en.softonic.com.com&quot; is just the name of a program. For example: http://emule.en.softonic.com/. They have around 10.000 subdomains all well indexed on Google. Try to search &quot;Download Emule&quot; and you&#x27;ll find it. You can also try &quot;Download uTorrent&quot; or different keywords but you&#x27;re going to find it anyway.<p>Every download page has links to other search pages.<p>Open again http://emule.en.softonic.com/.

It&#x27;s not clear that chip cards would have avoided the Target thing since the fraudsters infiltrated the terminal software. I&#x27;m guessing more current terminals/software is simply harder to compromise. &quot;Chip & pin&quot;, as is widely used in places such as Canada and Europe, might help a bit since you would need the PIN to shop off-line. But it would have minimal effect for online shopping since PIN is typically not requested.<p>Limiting the fraud to online only would have greatly reduced the potential damage. There was a reason why carders were making physical cards to use, it&#x27;s muuuch easier to get a transaction through.

Every single house had fiber in place for TV, Phone and Internet. Sounds great! Right? In theory yeah, but not so much in practice. Every house had a network fee added as part of their homeowner&#x27;s due. This fee went to an external company that ran the network. This company didn&#x27;t have much or any incentive to properly manage, update or keep the network running. They had a captive audience. Everybody pays every month whether they use the network or not. Network down? They&#x27;ll get to it in a bit after they take care of their competitive neighborhoods. And though fiber sounded great, the speeds they were getting weren&#x27;t much different than other areas near-by on cable modems. So want to forget it and go with Comcast? Sorry, they don&#x27;t serve the neighborhood as they can&#x27;t be competitive when everybody in the neighborhood is already paying for the fiber network. I recall the neighborhood association had gone through a couple of different management companies, with pretty much the same result.

7159013,comment,7156430,7157848,5,0,gjm11,,,"I think there are two main things about LW that strike some people as cultish. (There are others, less important.) Both are less true than they were, say, a year ago.<p>1. Its distinctive brand of rationalism grew out of this huge long series of blog posts by Eliezer Yudkowsky, conventionally referred to on LW as &quot;The Sequences&quot;. So: we have a group of people united by their adherence to a set of writings by a single person -- a mixture of generally uncontroversial principles and more unusual ideas. It&#x27;s not a big surprise if this reminds some people of religious scriptures and the prophets who write them.<p>2. The LW culture takes seriously some ideas that (a) aren&#x27;t commonly taken very seriously in the world at large, and (b) share some features with some cults&#x27; doctrines. Most notably, following Yudkowsky, a lot of LW people think it very likely that in the not too distant future the following will happen: someone will make an AI that&#x27;s a little bit smarter than us and able to improve itself (or make new AIs); being smarter than us, it can make the next generation better still; this iteration may continue faster and faster as the AIs get smarter; and, perhaps on a timescale of days or less, this process will produce something as much smarter than us as we are smarter than bacteria, which will rapidly take over the world. If we are not careful and lucky, there are many ways in which this might wipe out humanity or replace us with something we would prefer not to be replaced by. -- So we have a near-omnipotent, incomprehensible-to-us Intelligence, not so far from the gods of various religions, and we have The End Of The World (at least as we know it), not so far from the doomsdays of various religions.<p>Oh, and LW is somewhat associated with Yudkowsky&#x27;s outfit, MIRI (formerly the Singularity Institute), and Yudkowsky is on record as saying that the Right Thing to do is to give every cent one can afford to them in order to reduce the probability of a disastrous AI explosion. Again, kinda reminiscent of (e.g.) a televangelist telling you to send him all your money because God is going to wrap things up soon. On the other hand, I do not believe that&#x27;s his current position.<p>For the avoidance of doubt, I do not myself think LW is very cult-like.",1391200346

This warrants respect, not insults.<p>I create wealth by pure thought. Sure that sounds stupid to some, but it&#x27;s quite true: with about a thousand dollars&#x27; worth of borrowed equipment, I sit here writing software to do things useful to my employer. I am not &quot;extracting wealth&quot;, I am <i>creating</i> it, organizing electron flows to do things useful to clients, things they are willing to pay for whereby <i>both</i> of us (client & developer) benefit. It is my right to write software, my client&#x27;s right to use that software, and our right to work out an exchange of representations of wealth. The only &quot;extraction&quot; happens by contracting the exchange of one thing/service for another, facilitated by the abstraction of currency; this creates more wealth in the system, leaving both in a better place than they would be otherwise.<p>My country&#x27;s government was created to facilitate the exercise of rights by delegating limited powers to government. Insofar as the &quot;shared system&quot; goes, taxation exists to fund those limited powers, and arguably provide a minimal safety net to the truly destitute (insofar as charity is unable to). Beyond that, ownership is a respected & protected right, and the economy functions by people creating things to own (wealth) and exchanging representations of that wealth (money).<p>What you & other &quot;wealth inequality&quot; agitators &quot;ask&quot; for <i>is</i> theft, insofar as it demands - under threat of violence by those unrelated to that wealth - those who create or negotiate more wealth than others must, with no objective basis in ownership & contract, give to those who have done nothing for it.<p>I understand what we have is not a perfect system; that imperfection is a consequence of what some deem &quot;original sin&quot; (adjust terminology as your values see fit to match the point). Bad as it may be, it is better than any other system wherein one group extorts wealth from others without agreement or moral right thereto. Just because one manages to leverage opportunity better than others does <i>not</i> mean those others can &quot;rectify&quot; the situation by saying &quot;we outnumber you, we&#x27;ve decided what you own belongs to us, and if you don&#x27;t hand it over we&#x27;ll do horrible things to you.&quot;<p>Yes, progressive taxation is institutionalized theft. Taxation should fund the costs of government carrying out limited powers to facilitate rights as delegated by the national constitution; insofar as income taxation is the current method, it should be blind (as justice should be). The counterpart to your notion that the wealthy exploit the system, is that the wealth pump the system too: their wealth is not squirreled away out of reach of the shared economy, it is rammed right back in thru investments, creation of markets for luxury goods, and prolific charity; the evil you impute is at minimum balanced by the good it creates. Every dollar should be taxed equally, as (on the whole) those who acquire more income do much in the shared economy with it. Insofar as sheer poverty fits in, I&#x27;ll acquiesce to deducting a minimum income; if you&#x27;re better off than objectively poor, you can do your fair share too.<p>Those agitating about &quot;wealth inequality&quot; always fail to objectively address the charity which the rich give to. Just because someone isn&#x27;t giving money via taxation doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re not doing tremendous good; confiscating more by taxation reduces what they can <i>and do</i> give by other ways.<p>And, just to hammer the point home yet another way (however palatable it may or not be): in a well-armed population, &quot;majority rules&quot; is not sufficient grounds for confiscation. There are a LOT of people prepared to fight back against the self-appointed redistributors of wealth.

So he realises that he can pour dollars held in starbucks cards out of person A&#x27;s card and onto (his starbucks card?/his bank account? Not sure how that works as not got a starbucks card)<p>Anyway, he thinks he is onto a good deal, getting a latte at 30% off.  However 10,000 dollars worth of latte requests later, and our OP smells a rat?  Someone has bought starbucks gift cards with stolen CC details and then found a BTC owner willing to swap those gift cards for nice anonymous BTC.<p>I think that starbucks here is at least one money transmitter - they are taking payment at the NY branch, and guaranteeing the funds to our OP when he gets the card number.<p>However, there are a number of betwix and between issues - how do you buy a starbucks card with a stolen CC number? Is this a walk round the stores process? I would assume no-one saw his site and <i>then</i> went shopping, which implies that quite a large amount of starbuck&#x27;s float will come from stolen CC - can anyone verify that?<p>But this one looks like <i>everyone</i> is in breach of some law some where. Starbucks, the OP, the credit card thieves. Unless Starbucks has a license as a money transmitter (transfer service for us in the UK)<p>There is a nice idea here - if you can automate throwing 5 bucks from one Starbucks gift card to another, you can invite someone to have a virtual coffee.  How did you do that?<p>edit:<p>The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of the U.S. Treasury Department requires MSBs to register.[9] It is also a felony to engage in money transmission without a license in any state that requires a license to operate.[10] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_transmitter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_transmitter</a><p>I would give those guys a call - but probably after calling your own lawyer.  IANAL, but this is a sticky situation, and probably unique to date.  Hope all goes well.<p>I expect <i>intention</i> will count for a lot here.<p>Edit: according to random site on inter web (<a href=""http://qz.com/166193/why-a-start-up-coffee-company-is-now-accepting-starbucks-gift-cards/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qz.com/166193/why-a-start-up-coffee-company-is-now-ac...</a>) Starbucks cards can only transfer balance to another Starbucks card, and be redeemed at Starbucks for goods.  So I <i>think</i> they still need to be considered a money transmitter.  Anyway the upshot is that about 4bn is put on these cards yearly and 650m was left as cash on the cards at end of last year.  Which is nice for Starbucks.<p>And I think the &quot;have a coffee on me&quot; idea is quite workable - I could happily sip a latte and join a webinar if you paid for the latte.  maybe not - sounds a bit cheap.",1391199905

I was referring to how that was the only place on the page that referred to Start, whereas almost all of the rest of page&#x27;s content was Find-centric.<p>Slides 26-28: I kinda thought the interstitial title card alluded to that. Is there a better way you&#x27;d recommend?<p>Slide 35: Yeah, I tend to agree with you on that. That might have been an &quot;orange pen&quot; candidate. I was just commenting on their persistence, I suppose.<p>Slide 44: There&#x27;s a chance this happened because there were no upcoming Meetups scheduled at that time. But I completely agree with you - hence slides 45 & 46.<p>Thanks again for your thoughtful commentary!",1391198564

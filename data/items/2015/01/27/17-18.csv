Germany has benefited enormously because of the euro, and yet you see a lot of belly aching about the southern European countries.<p>Countries really only have two valves to throttle their economies.  Interest rates (which Greece now has the highest in the European Union), and printing more money.<p>Right now because the Greek economy is in a log jam, they&#x27;re suffering from deflation and a shrinking economy.  Interest rates have to be high so that the government can continue to borrow money to keep the country running, but that means companies aren&#x27;t leveraging capital to expand.<p>If Greece weren&#x27;t part of the Euro, it could simply print more cash, which would reverse the deflationary pressure and allow the government to bring down interest rates.  It would also mean the flow of trade from Germany to Greece would probably balance out more because the domestic economy in Greece would be cheaper than importing German goods.",1422381535

This is why in my teens I spent more time reading math books than playing with computers.<p>Interesting perspective, and similar to mine.  I gravitated towards this industry because of the problems to solve, not the means of solving them.  I have been taking things apart to figure out how they work since I was 6 or so.  I didn&#x27;t even have a computer until I was 17, but I was already dead set on becoming some sort of engineer because I loved those sorts of challenges.  In fact, I ended up going electrical because in undergrad I decided I hated programming but loved physical electronics and electrical wiring.  I came back to programming after I had been working for a few years and discovered that real-world programming was not like the classes I hated.<p>I don&#x27;t know where that puts me in Jacques&#x27; eyes.  I like using knowledge and technology to solve problems, but I don&#x27;t care what particular technology it is.  Sometimes I feel like an outsider in this industry, because I interact with so many people who love programming in itself and tend to look down on those who do not.  I don&#x27;t feel attacked by this post but I do feel he is drawing up a false dichotomy between those who &quot;[l]earned to program as a kid&quot; and &quot;totally fell in love with it&quot;, and those who are in this industry for the money, have little or no technical knowledge, and no desire to gain any more than the bare minimum of technical knowledge required to achieve their financial goals.",1422380915

The future I was trying to build around the turn of the millennium was one in which people had information to make educated decisions and to achieve their goals. The actuality that has come about is that more than ever people are falling for hype and being sidetracked from their goals.<p>It used to be that if you wanted to become a more educated voter, going online would result in you landing on a few political-science related resources and you&#x27;d end up reading some pretty hardcore theory: Bob Black, Michel Foucault, Karl Marx. Maybe it was a bit extremist but you would actually have a theoretical understanding of the issues. Now it&#x27;s more likely you&#x27;ll come across carefully-crafted &quot;grassroots&quot; political blogs that hype one side or the other without actually encouraging you to make an educated decision.<p>It used to be that if you wanted to bike across the country, Sheldon Brown&#x27;s webpage[1] would help you figure out how to do it.

The theory is that there is a balance point between the scale at which activities are most efficient operating on a command model and the scale at which activities are most efficicently managed by market mechanisms. The position of the balance point is different from industry to industry, and also varies over time with economic conditions. Idealy you want efficient markets, but also a dynamically responding corporate world that can freely consolidate, diversify, merge, etc to adapt it&#x27;s structure to whatever is most efficient as technology, supply, demand, etc shift in the economy.<p>This is why command economies tend to be less efficient, because any given market and corporate structure is only most efficient for very specific economic conditions. Heavy regulation of companies, markets and things like employment law tends to freeze their structure in place, so they are unable to adapt as conditions change.<p>So markets are only one aspect of an efficient economy. A  flexible corporate, finance and employment environment is the other. Hence the economic flexibility and strength of the USA. Something as a Brit I&#x27;m perfectly willing to admit to. I&#x27;m not saying economic strength is the be-all and end-all of civil society.

The economic forecasts on which the German (really the EC, ECB, and IMF) analysis relied didn&#x27;t account for the fact that reduced government spending would cause a reduction in GDP.<p>They assumed that reduced government spending would somehow (magic?) increase private sector investment and result in economic growth. The forecast for the <i>WORST</i> unemployment would get was around 12%, and by this point the recession was supposed to be a distant memory. They were so, so, so wrong.<p>Greece probably made mistakes, but don&#x27;t pretend the Germans are innocent and being painted as the &quot;bad guys&quot; unfairly. The Germans ignored all reasonable economic logic and forced austerity on Greece for ideological reasons. That&#x27;s exactly the kind of thing &quot;bad guys&quot; do and the Greeks are justified in their anger.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Austerity-The-History-Dangerous-Idea/dp/019982830X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Austerity-The-History-Dangerous-Idea/d...</a><p><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/05/imf-underestimated-damage-austerity-would-do-to-greece"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/05/imf-underest...</a><p><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/03/an-amazing-mea-culpa-from-the-imfs-chief-economist-on-austerity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/03/a...</a>",1422379779
8954377,comment,8952959,8954000,0,0,tomp,,,"Germany is a nation that has benefited enormously from a single currency (according to my understanding).<p>A large source of currency fluctuations are trade imbalances. If a country exports more than it imports, its currency appreciates. If it imports more than it exports, it depreciates. For example, if USA imports from the UK are bigger than it&#x27;s exports to the UK, then USA will be buying GBP with USD (on average), so the value of GBP will go up relative to USD. This would in turn make UK products more expensive to Americans, so they would buy them less, correcting the trade imbalance.<p>If Greece, Italy, Spain etc. still had their own currencies, they could simply depreciate them (actually, it would happen naturally, as a consequence of trade imbalance) and so reduce their debt in real terms (similar to what has happened to Iceland). If Greece&#x27;s currency would depreciate, imports would be more expensive for Greeks, so they would import (spend) less, while Greek exports would be cheaper worldwide, so they would export (earn) more.<p>Conversely, Germany&#x27;s currency would appreciate, again because of trade imbalances (they export more than they import).<p>Because of EURO, this hasn&#x27;t happened, and won&#x27;t happen - the trade balances are averaged, making Germany&#x27;s currency (EUR) less valuable than it should be, and Greece&#x27;s currency (again EUR) more valuable than it should be. This benefits Germany, because it can sell its cars cheaper, but isn&#x27;t helping Greece, because Greek olive oil and tourism experiences are more expensive than they should be.<p>The short-term solution is for Germany to admit this advantage and help the under-performing countries (by giving them money, not just loans, and correcting the trade imbalances this way). In the long term, a single currency should lead to a single fiscal government (like in the US).",1422379772

8954296,comment,8952959,8954000,0,0,atmosx,,,"Ahm, no. That&#x27;s absolutely not true. As a prominent example of German Help, here is the history of the Siemens scandal[1][3]. Also, German&#x27;s choice for PM when Papandreou quit, was Loukas Papademos. It&#x27;s the guy who in 2001 acted as a bridge between Goldman Sachs and Greece to false statistics and allow Greece into the EUR. Isn&#x27;t a kind of strange choice? There are many more situations (military equipment, MAN, etc.) where the German government actively undermined Greece.<p>Germany, unfortunately, is seen as the arch-enemy along with Brussels in Greece. After 6 years of austerity measures and governments who followed policies dictated by the troika (ECB, IMF, EU but mainly it&#x27;s Germany) we rank #1 in Europe in suicides, the economy is worse then ever and the public debt has gone up instead of down. At this point many Greeks don&#x27;t care what a Grexit would bring because they already trespassed the point X of &quot;caring&quot;. They are already <i>poor</i> by all means.<p>That said, it&#x27;s true again that Germany flushed billions of EU in saving the Greek economy. But almost all of that money was used to keep foreign banks happy by paying high yield Greek bonds owned by German and French banks mainly. The rest of the money was flushed to Greek banks owned by heavily corrupted bankers (e.g. Latsis - Eurobank). Even in situations of small banks like ProtonBank[2] were kept because declared of &quot;national interest&quot; (Ev. Venizelou - Leader of PASOK former Finance Minister and Vice-President) and thus bailed-out in the sound of millions while some pensions went as down as 350 EUR/month at the same time.<p>So to make a long story half-long: The German government is an extreme supporter of the old, highly corrupt, heavily bribed (by many german corporations) Greek government which doesn&#x27;t make sense. Merkel is crying home for the Greman tax-payer when indirectly the only thing she really did was just handing money indirectly from the German taxpayer to the German banks via Greece (with huge interests). Truth is that given the results, Germans were more than happy to vote Merkel, so in a strictly political her policy was extremely successful. The only problem is that now all over Europe there is a strong anti-German feeling: Italy (M5S), Spain (Podemos), UKIP (Farage), France (LePen). So give it another ~ 2 years and Greece will be the least of Germany&#x27;s problem.<p>Now the real problem Germany and EU is facing is this: If they bailout Greece, they must bail-out Italy and Spain too. Maybe France will follow. But the Greek debt is small so it can be done, if there&#x27;s political will and a sort of promise that <i>Greeks won&#x27;t fuck up their economy again anytime soon</i>! But for Italy it&#x27;s a different matter, if Italy and Spain require a cut oh well... I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s even possible mathematically speaking. On the other hand mathematics was never a part of economics, it&#x27;s mostly politics. There are logistical ways (e.g. the EU buys bonds from <i>failed states</i> and hides them in a locker room for eternity at a very low rate which the countries could start paying God-knows-when...) to bypass this, but the problems are at the level of politics mostly. If Merkel concedes now, the opposition inside Germany will literally <i>trash her</i> and she will not be able to come up with answers, since the story of the <i>poor Greek who spends more than he could afford</i> is the one she choose a couple of years ago.<p>Sorry the long answer!

This included start up&#x27;s and very large (Fortune 50, on the lower end of the digits) companies.<p>I believe I was a very successful Director and VP level manager. However, I realized a few things that made me switch back.<p>1) Engineers, particularly me, don&#x27;t like to manage. Most of us get into it for the money or because it&#x27;s some sort of natural career progression. But generally it means more of the things we don&#x27;t like doing. Meetings, personnel issues, hiring, firing, and not coding. Some say that management at that level get more say in the product direction or in other business matters and I have not found that to be true. Engineers get just the same amount, if not more, say in product than any manager. If you happen to be a &quot;hands-on&quot; VP, you get to do all of those things you don&#x27;t enjoy doing from 10-4 and then code on the product all night. That can be quite unpleasant.<p>2) &quot;Natural Career Progression&quot; is a myth. If we&#x27;re talking about purely financial benchmarks, as an engineer and a consultant I make more than just about every manager I know. And certainly quite a bit more than I made as a VP, including equity. If we are talking about career &quot;prestige&quot; or &quot;respect&quot;, as an engineer I get asked to speak at more conferences, write more articles, and get on the phone with more CEO&#x27;s than I ever did as a manager.<p>3) Quality of life and happiness. I have spent the better part of my entire life learning how to make computers do what a company needs them to in order to make money on their product idea. I think a lot of VP&#x27;s and Director&#x27;s absolutely love their job, but I felt unproductive and constantly inefficient. I wasn&#x27;t making a computer do what the company needed it to do to make money on a product. I was trying to get engineers to work, I was settling disputes between engineers and other engineers, engineers and other managers, managers and product schedules, product schedules and financing, upper management and partners, the list goes on and on. This did not make me happy. I didn&#x27;t sign up in this business to be the referee. I want to be the best engineer, so I strive to become the very best at that.<p>Now to answer your specific questions. I was a director or VP level for 7 years. I walked out of my last job as a VP and walked into a consulting role the following day making 20% more. The transition was absolutely seamless and I did not play catch up. However, this may be more of a testament to my own learning and retention. Others may take longer.",1422378868

In terms from 100,000 feet up,\nwe&#x27;re still talking, say,\n<i>Turing machine equivalent</i> so that\nwe should still be able to get the\nsoftware written without some\nparticular framework.\nAnd, following the OP where it recommended\nstaying with the <i>technology</i> the team\nalready knew, the new <i>technology</i>\nlikely will not be much or any more\neffective, efficient, etc., at least in the short term,\nfor the \nproject at hand.<p>But, I believe that the OP is missing \nan important point, one that, in my opinion\n(IMO), your mileage may vary (YMMV),\nis too often missed:<p>First, for context, assume that the project\nis to solve a problem where \na good solution will be quite valuable\nbut apparently also quite challenging\ntechnically.  Or, the nature of the\nchallenge is, say, &quot;How the heck\nis it even possible to do that?&quot;.<p>Second, let&#x27;s focus on just the \ntechnical part of the solution,\nthat is, on the challenge:<p>For this focus, let&#x27;s have an example\nwhere the <i>technology</i> very much did\nmatter.<p>Ike wanted some pictures.  The\nU-2 reconnaissance airplane was too slow and too low,\nand, thus, too vulnerable to being shot down,\nand he needed a plane that\nwould fly higher and faster, enough \nof both so that\nit would be much more difficult to shoot down.<p>So, flying at 80,000+ feet at Mach 3.0+\nshould suffice.  And, by the way, need\nrange 2000+ miles without refueling.<p>A challenge:  Put two really large\nturbojet engines in an otherwise really small\nairplane and can get thrust enough\nfor Mach 3.0+, but some aerodynamics\nsays that at such speeds the air\ninto the engine, as it slows down to\nsubsonic speed as needed\nby the compressor stage, \ncan get so hot it will cause\nmajor parts of the engine to\noverheat, i.e., burn out.\nThere was at one time at least\none MIG 25 pilot who\ncould confirm this point.<p>Relevant technology:<p>(1) There was a unit\nof Pratt and Whitney\nin Florida that considered\nsuch jet engine problems and\nhad a bright idea:\nAt Mach 2.5+ or so,\ndon&#x27;t really need the\nturbojet compressor.\nInstead, treat the engine\njust as a ram jet.\nSo, take the input air,\nlet it bypass the\nusual compressor and turbine\nstages, let it enter at essentially the\nusual afterburner stage,\nadd fuel, and go.\nBright idea.\nAnd, yes, they made it work.<p>(2) At Mach 3.0+, even at 80,000 feet,\nthe friction, etc., of the air\ngets the surface of the airplane\nhot.  So, need, say,\nstainless steel or titanium.\nThe MIG 25 used stainless steel.<p>Well, at Lockheed, Kelly Johnson\nconsidered the Pratt and Whitney\nengine and titanium and designed\nand built a few dozen of the\nthe SR-71s;\nIke got his pictures;\nand no SR-71 was lost to\nenemy action.<p>So, the engine and the\ntitanium were <i>technology</i>\nthat very much did &quot;matter&quot;.<p>And there are more examples\nfrom the past, and there may\nbe more examples in the future,\nthat is, where <i>technology</i>\nvery much does &quot;matter&quot;.<p>Not all possibly relevant <i>technology</i>,\neven for software projects,\nis just software frameworks, etc.\nas considered in the OP.",1422378563

For example a search for &quot;mysql error 1045&quot; brings up posts from stackoverflow, linuxquestions, ubuntuforums, and serverfault that all mention an incorrect password. The &quot;best&quot; answer is the one that instructs you on how to reset your password.<p>Other queries you can try are:<p>&quot;linux check hard drive space&quot;\n&quot;openssl aes&quot;\n&quot;reset safari 8 on yosemite&quot;\n&quot;how to remove spilled wine from macbook?&quot;<p>I had concerns as well about whether this type of search engine &quot;steals&quot; content from other sites. I consulted with a few lawyers and their legal consensus was that this fell under fair use since I was a) Only showing a portion (specific posts) from each site and b) Transforming the posts in a novel way (i.e. re-ranking them).

A strong understanding of this really helps.<p>2) Layout xml. In my opinion Layouts are a weak point for even reasonably experienced Android developers. This is an area that leads to a ton of performance issues if you don't think through it properly.<p>3)Device compatibility including targeting different SDKs[1] and different screens[2].<p>4) Adapters.[3] They are the data structures that back most of Android and if you are good with these there is a lot you can make with them pretty much alone.<p>5) If you have the time I also recommend reading through the Android design docs.[4] It helps give a bit of insight into what Android is trying to accomplish and what is important in the eco system.<p>These are just a couple general areas that are important and different.

The combination of {heat engine + heat pump} -- i.e., the power plant generating electricity, followed by the electricity powering a heat pump in your house -- is more efficient than using the same heat in your house directly. E.g.: 1 Joule of heat, in a power plant, can bring to you 2 Joules of heat in your house (through an intermediate of 0.5 Joules of electricity).<p>This doesn't violate the 1st law of thermodynamics. You are not converting 1 Joule of heat into 2 Joules of heat. You are using 1 Joule of heat to <i>move</i> 2 Joules of heat out of a large heat sink (the outside atmosphere, or maybe the ground).<p>It doesn't violate the 2nd law either. A power plant runs on very high temperature differences -- Carnot ratio Th/Tc as high as 5.0 (1,500 K / 300 K). A heat pump runs on very small temperature differences, maybe 1.1 (e.g. 300 K / 280 K).

They decide to ban rides of less than 1 mile because that is hurting their bottom line? They decide that if you want to ride in an Uber cab you need to provide ID and have your fingerprints taken in case of crime? If they're a company built around ignoring regulations and have effectively killed all alternatives, then what? People can't just boycott Uber, because they have no other choices.<p>The current taxi companies cannot compete with Uber; if they try to they will lose their licenses to operate and they're not big enough to swallow the losses and evolve into an Uber alternative... by ignoring regulations Uber is making it impossible for anyone to compete. The regulations now are not perfect, as many articles have explained there are problems with them (such as restricted licensing to operate, huge start up costs...) but just ignoring them is not the solution.<p>As others have pointed out in this thread, there <i>are</i> ways to innovate within the taxi business while respecting the regulations and there are businesses doing that now, if Uber wants to genuinely protect consumer interests in the long term they should be pushing for the regulations to be addressed; not ignoring them and putting consumers at risk in the long term.<p>[1] Companies that have identified the regulations as not being perfect.",1363092364

In healthcare, we are arguably seeing the expected outcome of a lack of meaningful price competition.<p>The government <i>could</i> take action to enable competitive individual purchasing of care instead of monopsony or group buying. It could provide cash incentives for people who shop around for basic, easy-to-understand care. It could fund patient education for more complex care. And if this model proves successful, it could be expanded to harder-to-understand care gradually and with caution to see how consumers react.<p>In other words, competition can only work if it's allowed to. Today, food prices are raised for various reasons, but I am not aware of a school of economics that faults this on a demand-side government-funded competitive individual purchasing program (not that you said that either).",1363090896

Back in Jan 2011 I quit my day job after saving up my $ for a year and began my first startup, a hardware + SaaS business. It was exciting and at the end of 14 months I had a handful of customers but not enough incoming to keep me going so I went back into the workforce full time, running it on the side. Naturally my time is pretty limited. Users kept signing up and I had to constantly print and post them unique welcome forms, direct debit forms, post out monthly invoices etc, the list goes on. The paperwork alone took me hours. I'd have just coded up each form into a batch job if the content on them didn't change so drastically. I needed a mail merge system that worked.<p>So I checked out the offerings from MS and Libre Office much to my dismay. 36 steps, an excel file, stand on a sheet of alfoil and hit merge and you've got your mail merge done hopefully. Finding them not quite capable of doing what I needed I did what any coder with a few spare evenings does and I wrote my own that spat out PDFs from a csv file. I shot the idea past some business connections from startup 1 and got back a lot of positive feedback from. In fact so much feedback that the recurring theme was that they were shouting at me ""How do I use this, my secretary/wife/monkey spends hours hand editing our invoices and still half of them are inconsistent. Sell me this now!"". I realised hardly anyone except MS Word pro's and well trained office staff actually know how to do a mail merge. Usually not the kind of people you find in a small business. So why not make an app out of it.<p>The spare evenings turned into 6 months and a few banking headaches but finally it's ready for it's first release.<p>www.rocketmailmerge.com<p>Any and all constructive feedback is welcome. I've got plans to put an intro video on the front page when time permits and add some extra features, but I'll see how the feedback goes first before stretching the MVP boundaries too far.",1363089923

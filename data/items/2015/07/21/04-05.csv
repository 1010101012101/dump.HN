On the plus side, it means that the upcoming release (Office 2016) has an internal version number that matches the year.<p>I guess the question is whether the people at Microsoft who decide these things are themselves superstitious or whether they think their customers are superstitious (to the point that they would avoid a product with an unlucky internal version number).",1437454665

9920632,comment,9909901,9914875,0,0,wiredfool,,,"I&#x27;d bet with a good model generation, the FEA on this is completely tractable in realtime now. It&#x27;s only ~2(spokes)*6 dof, and that was doable in a second or so on a sparc in matlab 20 years ago. But to do that, you&#x27;d need to be doing beam elements for the spokes and rim segments, not meshing them with smaller solid elements. (And unless you&#x27;re in non-linear land in material or geometry, a 2 node beam element with 6 dof /node is going to be an exact solution for the spokes, and a good approximate solution for the rim as long as the chord/arc error isn&#x27;t large. )  And I&#x27;ve found some of the code, and holy crap it&#x27;s still on the web. <a href=""http://www.ce.washington.edu/~soroos/matlab/501/1../wheel2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ce.washington.edu/~soroos/matlab/501/1../wheel2.h...</a> (I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m going to hate the 19yr ago me when I dig into that and try to figure out what the hell I was doing based on the comments, because I only remember the outlines of the math at this point.  But... I could put this in numpy...  I need this like I need another project to suck up my time...  And I&#x27;m not sure what the me of 2034 is going to think of my code now. But that&#x27;s another story.)<p>The real trick with wheels from experience as a wheel builder is that all the really interesting behavior is in the non-linear region. And you&#x27;re butting right up against that when you lace the wheels tightly. Calculating that limit is tricky.<p>(Briefly, Ultimate load limit is ~ the sum of the tension in the spokes in the loaded zone of the wheel, roughly 4 or so with the rims/spokes I was looking at at the time. The tension limit is just under what will potato chip buckle the rim. So there&#x27;s a complex interaction between spoke stiffness, rim lateral stiffness, and rim radial stiffness that affects performance at the load limit. Helpfully, fatigue durability is also better with higher tension in the spokes, since the fatigue performance goes to hell when you get stress reversals.)<p>FWIW, My masters was investigating back calculating material parameters from a dynamic pavement test based on time histories of surface loading and displacement at known locations. I basically figured out that the error measure that we were using was pretty smooth as the stiffness of the subsurface layers varied and that it was possible to home in on a stiffness profile pretty consistently if there was at least a plausible guess of what was under there. It took a long time then though, overnight runs were common, and we didn&#x27;t have clusters then. (also, uphill both ways, through the snow) I bet I could do it in near realtime now on my ipad, but that&#x27;s a masters thesis for someone else.",1437454613

9920618,comment,9917773,9920577,0,0,im3w1l,,,"Ok let me give you an example of a monad! The Maybe monad. In this case a monadified value either has a normal value, or it has a null. Ok, so for the operations. &quot;return&quot; should monadify a value. In this case it does this by creating a Maybe that has that value (Maybes that have null can not be created with return. They must be created in some other way.). The bind operation creates a new function that takes a Maybe value from one that doesn&#x27;t. If the Maybe has a normal value then the function is run like normal. But if the Maybe has a null, the function is not run. Instead null is emitted directly.<p>Why is this a good thing? It means you can chain together many failure prone operations, and you only have to check for null at the end, not in the middle. So it works a little bit like exceptions.<p>Let&#x27;s verify the laws:<p>1. We have some value, and some function that could take that value, and either emit a result, or a null. If we monadify our value, we get a Maybe that has that value. If we bind our function, and then run it with our Maybe, what happens? Well we know our Maybe is not null, because we just put in a totally legit value. So because of how we defined our bind, the function will run just like normal.<p>2. Ok so lets bind &quot;return&quot; and see what happens. If the input is a maybe that has null, then we never run &quot;return&quot; but just emit null. Consistent with identity!\nIf the input is a maybe with a normal value, then we run &quot;return&quot; with that value. Return creates a maybe that has that value. So we get out what we put in, it works!<p>3. There are a number of cases we have to go through but let&#x27;s do them one by one.<p>First construction:\na) x is null. f_ skips f and just emits null. g_ skips g and just emits null.\nb) x is non-null. first we put x in f_. Since x is not null we just apply f to the normal value. Now f can either emit a normal value or null.\nb1) f emits null. g_ is skipped result is null.\nb2) If result is not null, g is run with the normal result, and result of overall computation is g(f(normal argument))<p>Second construction:\na) x is null. g_f_ skips g_f and just emits null. Same result as before\nb) x is not null. g_f is run with value in x. To run g_f we first run f. Two cases. f emits normal value or null.\nb1) f emits null. g_ of null is null. So if value in x causes f to emit null we have null just as before.\nb2) f does not emit null. g_ just runs g with normal result. So if value in x does not cause f to emit null, result of computation is g(f(normal argument))<p>So both constructions work the same, they continue running until problem arises.",1437454227

If you have function that takes a normal argument and emits a monadified value. You could apply it to some argument right.

Remember how return takes an argument, and emits a monadified value? That means we can bind it! The second law states that the resulting function is just the identity for monadified stuff.<p>3. Lets say you have two functions f (e.g. float -> monad string) and g (e.g. string -> monad int) from normal argument to monadified value. We could bind them both and then compose them.<p><pre><code>    g_ = bind(g)\n    f_ = bind(f)\n    g_f_(x) = g_(f_(x))\n</code></pre>\nOr we could imagine instead binding only the second function, then composing the functions, and then monadifying the composition.<p><pre><code>    g_ = bind(g)\n    g_f(x) = g_(f(x))\n    g_f_ = bind(g_f)\n</code></pre>\nLaw 3 states that these two procedures yield the same g_f_",1437453197

This is more likely to be the result of lots of incremental improvements. We&#x27;ve made huge strides since the &#x27;60s, we have tons and tons of tools that we&#x27;ve built and use, but still at the end of the day software development is a crude endeavor. More often than not projects end up with &quot;big ball of mud&quot; architectures. And we lack the fundamental models and terminology to even talk about software design and architecture at a reasonable level most of the time. We have all these tools like TDD, static analysis, and so on, all of which is more or less bolted on to our other tools. And I can&#x27;t help but be reminded of both the pre-structured programming era and the pre-OOP era, when there was a transition from a kludgy mess of useful components bolted on to existing paradigms that congealed into a cohesive design that became a universal standard. In, say, 30 years programmers will not only have better tools they&#x27;ll have better techniques, better standards, and better models. They&#x27;d be able to look at the software projects of today and go &quot;oh, well, here you have a classic example of X common architecture design anti-pattern, which you can fix using techniques U, V, W, and Z&quot; and so forth. I think that alone will unleash a tremendous amount of potential in the use of computing systems and result in an inflection point in the effectiveness of software development projects.<p>The other is fully automated and configurable manufacturing. We have almost all of the necessary components in place for that today, but nobody&#x27;s put them all together yet, but it&#x27;ll be transformative. Imagine being able to upload a handful of files to some service somewhere and then those files would be used to produce PCBs; mechanical components and structures built from various materials (plastics, metals, composites, etc.) using 3D printing, injection molding, CNC milling, etc; and then having all of that assembled into a final device then shipped off to you. Imagine how that changes the economy we have today, how much it could accelerate innovation, how it could result in un-serviced economic niches finding satisfaction, and so on. Think about how many thousands of kickstarter projects would translate into simply designing something then making use of such a service. Also imagine how much things change if you can have a completely automated factory pumping out parts and goods 24/7. Imagine if you could bootstrap an industrial economy anywhere on Earth, or off, with a few shipping containers of machine tools set up the right way. And then you get into idea like self-replicating factories. Think about how all of this changes the economy into something that we would scarcely recognize today? What if manufacturing an automobile in 2100 was economically equivalent to manufacturing a diecast hot wheels toy today?",1437452200

Why can&#x27;t you just take Google+ Photos front end and build it up from there?",1437451379

They help us reason and catch our mistakes, because while software has grown more complex, we’re still stuck with the same old brains. If they tell you they don’t need types to catch errors, tell them that they must be much smarter than you, because you sure do. But even more, tell them that all the brainpower they use to not need types could turn into even greater, bigger, and more creative ideas if they let the compiler help them.<p>So true, type driven development allows me to solve problems and feel out a design space and leads me to an answer.<p>> This is not a language for clever people, although there are clever things that can be done in this language.<p>Totally agree.",1437451205

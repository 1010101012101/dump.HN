It gets mentioned a lot on HN.<p><a href=""http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn26868-do-sugary-drinks-trigger-early-puberty-in-girls.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn26868-do-sugary-drinks...</a><p>&quot;Ah, so that&#x27;s why the study found an association with sugary drinks?&quot;<p>&quot;Possibly. The study found that girls who drink more than 1.5 sugar-sweetened beverages a day started their periods 2.7 months earlier on average than girls who consumed them twice a week or less. The finding didn&#x27;t apply to fruit juice – which contains a sugar called fructose – only to drinks sweetened with sucrose.&quot;<p>&quot;What is the mechanism then?&quot;<p>&quot;That&#x27;s one of the problems: we simply don&#x27;t know. Karin Michels at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, who supervised the study, says that sucrose in sugary drinks causes a spike in the hormone insulin, which controls blood sugar levels. Over time this may make the body&#x27;s tissues less sensitive to the hormone, with consequences for metabolism. Quite why this would lower the age of menstruation isn&#x27;t understood, but a drug called metformin, which makes the body more sensitive to insulin, has been shown to reverse early puberty in clinical trials.&quot;<p>They don&#x27;t find this insulin spike with fructose.",1425092383

I find a quick walk or running an errand, especially if it&#x27;s cold out picks me up from feeling tired.<p>Try taking a full day off from devices on a weekend day or maybe both days.  Pick up some hobbies with less screen time.<p>When you are on the screen try to limit the time you have so maybe give yourself a half hour to get X complete and work against a timer. If you&#x27;re doing interesting work usually you&#x27;re excited to keep going/make progress. I use the pomadoro technique (work 25 min/5 min break) and sometimes if I&#x27;m making progress I just keep going through the breaks.<p>Also coding all day and most of the night is probably too much. Typically you only have X hours of productivity per day so if you exceed that you will feel tired sluggish and want to give up. So maybe code in smaller sprints to make the most of your time.<p>There are plenty of evenings I&#x27;d like to code more or do a tutorial, but I&#x27;m out of cognitive energy and just don&#x27;t have anything left.<p>I would try coding less, making the most of the time you allow yourself on screen time.

In fact, the burden of the proof should be yours when you make such a claim, but let me show why I believe otherwise: (approximate figure from wiki [1])<p>142 PWh of energy was used worldwide. Solar irradiance is 340000 PWh. It would take almost 200 years of steady 3% growth (or a 240x increase in consumption) to even reach 1% of solar irradiance as internal heat. Even then, the impact of greenhouse gases massively overshadows that.<p>On top of that, there&#x27;s no activity requiring exponentially more energy, or evidence that we may continue expanding energy demand for hundreds or years. In fact, if you look at per capita energy consumption vs GDP [2], you can clearly see a saturation of energy needs. Once the developing nations reach this, it seems demand growth is going to slow down. Nothing physical ever maintains an exponential growth for too long.<p>[1] <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/The-NASA-Earth%27s-Energy-Budget-Poster-Radiant-Energy-System-satellite-infrared-radiation-fluxes.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/The-NASA-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.withouthotair.com/c30/figure242.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.withouthotair.com/c30/figure242.png</a>",1425091947

9122597,comment,9120093,9120093,0,0,saluki,,,"Landing a contract gig can have lots of hoops, verifying past experience, background checks, etc.<p>For starters you could use your dated sites as portfolio pieces and try to get approval to obtain private beta credentials from your recent MVP work to show off your work. This would probably represent your experience more than making portfolio pieces just for your portfolio.  Most companies aren&#x27;t really picky about what your older work looks like as far as being dated. All projects looks dated after a few years. So I&#x27;d give it a go with your existing work and see if that opens doors. You can also work on adding in some portfolio pieces too while you&#x27;re going through the process with what you have.<p>Typically on interviews some of the conversation will center on code, but a big part will be experience working remotely, what would you do in this situation (project is getting behind schedule, you aren&#x27;t getting data/information you need, etc).

9122574,comment,9120921,9120921,0,0,tzs,,,"Journalism is one of those areas where the net has been a two edged sword.<p>Here&#x27;s how it worked a long time ago. We had three main ways we would get news (aside from person to person). There was television. There was radio. And there were newspapers and news magazines.<p>On television, there would be a morning news program, an evening news program, and a late night news program. The evening news was the most important. Watching this would often be an important part of a family&#x27;s daily schedule. Eat dinner and then watch the news. Or watch the news and then serve dinner. Or watch the news while eating dinner.<p>There were also weekly news magazines on television, such as &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, that would cover only 2 or 3 stories a week (sometimes only 1) but go into it in much more depth than the regular evening news could.<p>Back in those days, radio was one of our major sources of music. Every hour they would break for a few minutes of news. So if something important happened throughout the day, people would find out about it without having to wait for the evening news on TV.<p>For more in depth coverage of major stories, and for coverage of a broader range of stories than we got from TV or radio there was the newspapers and the news magazines. Every city but the smallest had at least one daily newspaper. Some cities had two or even more.<p>A very large fraction of the population subscribed to a newspaper. Many papers published both a morning edition and an evening edition, so you could choose which you wanted. Some only offered one, but another paper offered the other. Whichever you had, it would be a fixed part of your daily ritual.<p>I liked morning editions. That way I could stumble out of bed, groggily go retrieve my paper from in front of my door, somehow make my way to the bathroom, and then while sitting on the john look at the front page. If nothing was there that shocked me out of my lingering slumber, I&#x27;d turn to the comics pages and read them. I might have another go at the front page over breakfast.<p>Then in the evening there would be some reasonably fixed time when I&#x27;d sit down and read the news, the few sports results I might care about, and the non-news material like movie reviews, fluff pieces, and maybe have a go at the crossword puzzle.<p>This was typical. Most of us had some kind of habit that involved in us spending quality time with our newspaper every day.<p>Many also subscribed to a weekly news magazine, such as Time, Newsweek, or US News and World Reports. Reading this was often one of our comforting ritual events. These magazines were not as timely as our newspapers, but could go into a lot more detail.<p>The key here is that a large fraction of the population had integrated ingesting news into their lives in a habitual, ritualistic way, and in a way that minimized distractions from other sources. Kids knew not to disturb Dad when he&#x27;s reading his Sunday paper, or to keep the noise down when Walter Cronkite is on.<p>Comparing my recollection of those days to what I see now in others, and to how well I feel I am personally informed on the current events of our times, the impression I get as that we were better informed back then.<p>We have many more sources of news now, but we find stories from aggregators like Google News, or from link sharing sites like here and Reddit, or from what we see on Facebook and Twitter. The serious news by dedicated journalists we find through such means is mixed with links to poorly researched blogs and to sites that hide opinion as news.<p>When we do find ourselves reading good solid news, it is not part of some time we&#x27;ve set aside for getting the news. It is something we came across while entertaining ourselves, and we&#x27;ll easily be distracted away in a few minutes.<p>When I first got my Kindle, I tried trial subscriptions to the Kindle editions of the Seattle Times, the New York Times, and the Wall Street Journal, and I set aside &quot;news time&quot; each day to read them. I noticed an interesting thing. In discussion forums I participated in, I generally felt that the other participants and I were about equally well informed on the current events issues that came up in the forums. However, once I started reading newspapers, and reading them regularly, it seemed obvious that I was better informed than my forum mates.<p>I let the trials expire, because there were enough features missing from all three papers (no comics, no crosswords, no pictures) that it just did not seem that the time was right for newspapers on Kindle at the price they wanted. I noticed that I quickly reverted to feeling like my forum mates knew as much as I did.<p>I&#x27;m not saying we should dump internet as a source of news. Just that being well informed might require more than treating solid high quality news as something that can be sprinkled in among our cat videos and clever tweets to be stumbled upon as we flitter our limited attention spans from one thing to another.",1425091135

My Ruby would probably look as hacky as Joel Martin&#x27;s Python. I doubt there would be as large a difference if they were both written with the same language familiarity.",1425090074

9122503,comment,9119606,9121426,0,0,pknight,,,"I think about the future of WordPress a lot. Like what would WP look like if it was mostly JS? When I look at all the front-end developments (React etc), it&#x27;s really hard to gauge. On one level I&#x27;d love to see things become more framework agnostic and flexible. The json api in theory frees up a lot of restrictions in what devs can do with WP running as a backend. Even cooler if we can switch out Mysql with other kinds of databases.<p>But it&#x27;s kind of interesting, for all PHP&#x27;s warts, it has made it so easy to build things, allowing a huge amount of plugins and themes to develop. For all these years, devs didn&#x27;t need to worry about the latest library, from backbone to angular, from react to mithril etc. It&#x27;s the stability and ease of access that has been so important to growth.<p>Now that the web is so javascript oriented it&#x27;s really compelling to just think about how WP can adapt to it. But a big push toward adopting new methodologies just strips away the number one reason to develop with WordPress: the huge ecosystem that has solutions coded with PHP. And if you are going to create that rift, you might as well start with some other platform.<p>But it&#x27;s really hard to pick a winner now, React for example, could easily be overtaken by another lib in a years time. We&#x27;re unsure how Nodejs is going to develop. The json API&#x27;s current state is not superfast or fully developed yet.<p>I sometimes wonder that we&#x27;re underestimating the advantages of having something stable like PHP continuing to run at least part of the show. For example, I have yet to see any kind of theme (A WP theme or otherwise) coded with some kind of front-end oriented mvc setup that results in a qualitatively superior site experience.",1425089545

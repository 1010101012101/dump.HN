642702,comment,641683,642421,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Part of the deal is that all of our goals have to be falsifiable. That is, you have to be able to point to a goal six months later and be able to say, ""I didn't meet my goal."" So an example of a falsifiable goal would be to get 1000 RSS subscribers. A non-falsifiable goal would be organizing the world's information. Because there's no way you can be held accountable if you don't succeed.<p>So in general we each set our own falsifiable goals, and we're responsible for helping each other succeed. So in the sense that there's a performance standard to be met, your punishment for not meeting that standard is not accomplishing your goals.",1244177525

That said, spinal manipulation has the same effect as cracking your knuckles, which does result in pain relief and increased range of motion[0].<p>There is also significant evidence for the efficacy of accupuncture for treating several conditions, including migranes[1], nausea/vomiting resulting from chemotherapy[2] and improving success rates in in-vitro fertilization[3]<p>Most of the objections seem to be centered around the fact that modern science has no explanation for how these things work. We don't even know what makes the noise when joints are cracked[4]. The scientific and medical communities tend to be understandably reluctant to accept things as true without plausible explanations for how they work. That said, it's probably harmful to deny patients treatments that have been demonstrated effective simply due to a lack of understanding the mechanism of action.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.jmptonline.org/article/S0161-4754(07)00059-0/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jmptonline.org/article/S0161-4754(07)00059-0/abst...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab001218.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab001218.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab002285.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab002285.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18258932"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18258932</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracking_joints"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracking_joints</a>",1244176184

Sometimes having a problem solving mindset can make one miss the more elegant solution. Since you said you don&#x27;t have a strong opinion in regards to hard vs. soft wrapping, why go through the trouble of fixing an issue when you could simply make the issue irrelevant?<p>At this point you&#x27;ve already got it solved so it&#x27;s a bit of a moot point, but I&#x27;m interested in your thought process here.",1443110399

Reason one would be that the exit polls were not accurately reflecting the will of the people.  Reason two would be that the official results were not accurately reflecting the will of the people.  It could be both.<p>Since reason two would have been too uncomfortable to consider, reason one was chosen.  And the exit polls dried up.<p>It is not even widely known that prior to ending the polling completely, the pollsters were already applying statistically-calculated adjustment factors before reporting the poll results on air, in order to force the polling numbers to predict the official results more accurately.<p>I don&#x27;t even need to put my foil hat on to say that I trust a statistical prediction made by blindly sampling from a random pool of volunteer respondents over a secret-source black box that pretends to be counting votes, where there is significant incentive to cheat.<p>The great thing about exit polling is that <i>anyone</i> could do them, and publish the results along with their margin of error.  And some people still do.  They just don&#x27;t get reported on television during elections night coverage any more.<p>The second reason is that news programs are now reporting official results, as they are tallied and reported by those black box computer systems.  The computers can count electronic ballots quickly enough to report initial results shortly after voting booths close.  Exit polls lost the advantage of speed.  The television news programs like to be able to project the likely winners as soon as possible, and preferably before any competitors.  By the time the hand-counted paper ballot areas finish reporting, the winners have already been known for hours, if not days.",1443110370
10272344,story,,,2,2,eranation,"Ask HN: How do you manage vendor selection process?",,"Perhaps most of the startups here don&#x27;t do this enterprise-ish due diligence process of selecting a 3rd party vendor (or it boils down to a SO / HN question (like this one ironically) or simply looking for the most starred GitHub project)<p>But in Enterprise scenarios, choosing a backup solution, a BI solution, any 3rd party solution (open source + support or fully commercial) needs some due diligence selection process (getting RFPs, asking questions, installing demos, following up with vendors on all types of criteria when there is a time crunch to find the right vendor in a limited time)<p>Well, this is part of my day job, and I found out that excel spreadsheets seems to be the only standard way of doing it.<p>It has several issues, which are pretty obvious if you ever tried to use Excel as a collaborative database with many people (we can&#x27;t use Google Docs for some reason) e.g. if you filter it and save on the shared drive, everyone sees your filter. also you can&#x27;t share it directly with vendors as you don&#x27;t want them to know which other vendors are competing and you don&#x27;t want them to see their answers either. (and your private comments)<p>My question is this - is there any software out there that helps you choose software? e.g. something that comes out of the box with ready made criteria checklist, and lets you expose a URL for vendors to answer questions, track status of questions, put %VENDOR_NAME% placeholders so the question looks like it&#x27;s directed to them, etc. Also you can prioritize features / questions and rank the response etc.<p>Also it will let you team member rank vendors based on functional and technical criteria and give the CTO / CIO a dashboard with a final decision.<p>Sounds like something any CIO / CTO / technical purchasing department will be happy to have.<p>Seems like an open niche, is there any SAAS product (or self hosted) out there to do this? Or should I just take any ticket / helpdesk system and manage questions as tickets?",1443110347

10272332,comment,10271149,10272150,0,0,pron,,,"> I think the very most common property of programs I or anyone ever deals with is handily covered by Haskell&#x27;s type system: &quot;do these two (often complex) things fit together?&quot;<p>That is indeed very common, but it is neither the most important (it might be, but that requires evidence) nor is Haskell&#x27;s particular blend of proof vs. burden necessarily the best. You could have said the same about Java, C#, Go or C, each with their own limited type &quot;richness&quot;.<p>> We&#x27;d be better off if those tools were widely used<p>Formal verification tools that are able to prove many of the example I listed (or interesting-enough special cases) are  far from being in <i>wide</i> use in the industry in absolute terms, but they are certainly in <i>wider</i> use than Haskell (in spite of the latter&#x27;s popularity among bloggers), at least when it comes to large, complex software, which is where verification is most valuable anyway. Fujitsu have used JPF to verify a 1MLOC Java program[1], Amazon use TLA+ to verify/specify most (all?) of their AWS services (written in Java), some are quite complex[2], Esterel (or, rather, its descendants) is used by various realtime systems[3], and Intel uses TLA+ and/or internal verification tools to verify components in its processors. Each of those alone has seen more real-world &quot;tough&quot; industry usage than Haskell.<p>AFAICT, those tools are in wider use than Haskell in academia, too (aside from PL research, obviously), where they&#x27;re sometimes used to verify concurrent/distributed algorithms (and in at least one famous case, prove the <i>incorrectness</i> of a much-lauded algorithm[4][5]).<p>It is, however, true that <i>type-based</i> verification tools (like Coq) have seen even <i>less</i> use than Haskell (they&#x27;re basically unused in the industry) and other proof assistants are rarely used (a notable example is Isabelle, which has been used to verify the seL4 kernel, but AFAIK Isabelle isn&#x27;t type-based, but, like TLA+, uses set-theory). Even in academia, use of type-based proofs is very rare (virtually nonexistent outside PL).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://javapathfinder.sourceforge.net/events/JPF-workshop-050108/SymbolicJPF08.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://javapathfinder.sourceforge.net/events/JPF-workshop-05...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/4/184701-how-amazon-web-services-uses-formal-methods/fulltext"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/4/184701-how-amazon-web-s...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.esterel-technologies.com/industries/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.esterel-technologies.com/industries/</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://www2.research.att.com/~pamela/chord-ccr.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.research.att.com/~pamela/chord-ccr.pdf</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://brooker.co.za/blog/2014/03/08/model-checking.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brooker.co.za/blog/2014/03/08/model-checking.html</a>",1443110296

I don&#x27;t understand how any respectable developer could support programming DNA with current technologies.<p>You know how they code new organisms?  They rip out code from one organism and then they randomly insert it somewhere in the DNA code of another organism.  They do this thousands of times... 99.999% of the time the cell dies.  So they keep trying to compile random variations of code and it keeps crashing.  But let&#x27;s say they get lucky one time and the code compiles.  The cell lives, and then they use that cell to create a new organism.  If that organism has the one property they wanted to port over from the new DNA code, they call it a success. They don&#x27;t do any unit testing, they can&#x27;t possibly test every scenario this new organism would be used in production, and yet no one cares.<p>Would any software developer use a process like this in a production environment?  No - it&#x27;s obvious this way of coding would would cause drastic unintended consequences.  With GMOs you get malformed proteins, new chemicals/toxins, and interbreeding with other plants that could cause even more unintended consequences.<p>Usually I&#x27;m all for technological progress.

His reaction was to jump up and down, point at the screen, and yell “That sucks! That sucks! Wow, that’s neat! That sucks!”<p>I tried explaining how we&#x27;d performed an experiment proving pie menus were faster than linear menus, but he insisted the liner menus in NeXT Step were the best possible menus ever.<p>But who was I to rain on his parade, two weeks after the first release of NeXT Step 0.8?

(That&#x27;s why the demo asks for permission to use the webcam.)<p>The pie menu and each item has a title as well as a description. One feature I&#x27;ve added is the ability not only to disable an item, but also to provide an explanation of why the item is disabled! (PacMan in the demo is disabled, for example.) I wish other menus and widgets would do that -- it&#x27;s frustrating when you can find an item you want, but can&#x27;t figure out why it&#x27;s disabled!<p>Another nice thing about them is that you can either configure algorithmically with an API, or with JSON data (which makes it easy to make dynamic data driven menus downloaded from a server or database), or construct them in the Unity3D editor out of objects (which makes it easier for artists to design them)!<p>I&#x27;ve made a custom Unity3D editor that lets you edit the properties, drag and drop textures and objects, edit and rearrange the items, and has some convenience commands, so you can place the 3D item objects in a circle in the 3D world, and call a command that figures out which item is in which direction by their position, and tidies them up.

The risk of death among people with ADHD was more than double that in the general population (adjusted mortality rate ratio [MRR]=2.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.70 to 2.50, p<0.0001).</i><p><i>Age at diagnosis of ADHD was associated with mortality, with the risk of death highest among people diagnosed in adulthood (adjusted MRR=4.25, 95% CI 3.03 to 5.78). Mortality among people with ADHD was also affected by comorbid oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder (adjusted MRR=2.17, 95% CI 1.33 to 3.31) and by coexisting substance misuse (adjusted MMR=5.63, 95% CI 3.69 to 8.16). Among people without these comorbid conditions, mortality was higher in girls and women with ADHD (adjusted MRR=2.85, 95% CI 1.56 to 4.71) than in boys and men (MRR=1.27, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.76).</i><p><i>“Even if these complications did not develop, ADHD was still a risk factor for mortality.

In Germany, drivers know what distance they should keep and to look for cyclists when turning.  2.) The condition of the streets is incredibly poor in the US.

What matters is total journey time.<p>Imagine if you replaced all the trains with trek-style teleporters.  Rather than 100 people all getting onto a train and being whisked away, they would all wait in a line outside these devices.  That would be an increase in congestion, more people standing around waiting rather than moving.  But if the teleporters get them to their destinations faster nobody cares that they had to wait in line.<p>It&#x27;s a matter of perspective.  The city/transport planners see people standing around not moving as a bad thing.  But the people don&#x27;t care.  Standing on the slow train or standing in the line waiting for the fast train is all the same to them.  What works best for the people isn&#x27;t the an elegant system of slow trains to ensures nobody ever stops, where nobody ever suffers the evil congestion.  What works best for them is getting to work as fast as possible.  If that means crowds at bottleneck where in-feed is slightly faster then out-feed so be it.

You could even narrate a history of people on earth using ability to coordinate at greater scale as your x axis.<p>I&#x27;ve heard an interesting theory about homo sapien &quot;victory&quot; over neanderthals and other archaic humans. In some versions it&#x27;s upper paleolithic culture over lower paleolithic culture of which neanderthals, early sapiens and all the grey arrears around those groups.<p>In any case, the theory/hypothesis/narrative is that the difference between anatomically modern humans and their close cousins and homo sapiens sapiens was their ability to coordinate on larger scales than the biologically determined &quot;band&quot; size. Chimps, Gorillas and presumably earlier hominids live socially in groups that vary in size within a range determined by their biology. There are no chimp kings, tribes or limited liability companies, just troops and bands. Their bonding and cooperation mechanisms are based on biologically determined behavior. Environment and even culture play a role, but 250 chimps controlling a territory that would otherwise be controlled by more smaller troops  is not in their repertoire.<p>Imagine a population of archaic humans who, by use of language, religion, symbolism, abstract concepts of some unknown kind, oral history or some other means were able to coordinate 500 individuals, with 200 fighters. In a lot of contexts (the most obvious being war), that group would be at a huge advantage. These are our ancestors. It also suggests a gnarly explanation to the genetic bottleneck question.<p>This process continues through history. Mega bands become clans and tribes and super tribes and nations and all sorts of affiliations. They get bigger and more effectively coordinated. Economic and political dynamics emerge.

I&#x27;d think it&#x27;s just the opposite; if we have no external tests, that&#x27;s a great reason to assume it&#x27;s unreliable.<p>I&#x27;m not disagreeing with you on that--there&#x27;s always the possibility someone&#x27;s lying to you, and that has to be designed into your study as best as possible. It&#x27;s difficult. My point is more that <i>we don&#x27;t have any other choice</i> if we want to do a scientific study of things like loneliness. Or anything else that only exists within the context of one&#x27;s own head for that matter.<p>> That said, I&#x27;m not as confident as you that it&#x27;s not externally testable.<p>Perhaps it is. I&#x27;m only wary of these things because it&#x27;s very easy to find correlations. Studies of depression are full of this. You can find a certain brain region or gene or hormone level or whatever correlated with depression, but then you find someone who also feels depressed who doesn&#x27;t exhibit those symptoms. So do you tell that person they&#x27;re not &quot;really&quot; feeling depressed? Of course not.

All of your Go source MUST exist somewhere underneath $GOPATH/src. Otherwise, the build tooling simply won&#x27;t work. [1]<p>2. b. If your Go project is hosted on e.g. GitHub, it needs to exist at the path $GOPATH/src/github.com/bphogan/reponame. Do not attempt to work around this convention. [2]<p>2. c. Finally, whenever you import a package -- even if it&#x27;s a subdirectory of the same project/repo that you&#x27;re working in -- you need to specify the complete import path. That is, import &quot;github.com/bphogan/reponame/mypkg&quot;. [3] This has implications for forks, which can be dealt with.<p>3. a. Create a new repo on GitHub, write a `package main`, and commit/push. Now, anyone with a working Go installation can `go get github.com/bphogan/reponame` and your commandline tool will be downloaded, compiled, and placed in $GOPATH/bin for them to use.<p>3. b. As of Go 1.5, you can cross-compile binaries for platforms other than your own, by setting the GOOS and GOARCH environment variables before the `go` command. For example, if `go build` produces a binary for your current OS/Arch, then `env GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build` will produce a binary for linux/amd64.<p>---<p>[0] In reality, GOPATH is actually like PATH in that it can contain multiple delim-separated paths.

Some people like to have their repos represent their own GOPATH, and play games with setting a new GOPATH for each new repo/project. I can almost guarantee you that if you start doing this, you will become very frustrated with the language and probably give up on it.<p>[3] Relative imports, like import &quot;./foo&quot;, are technically allowed by the compiler, but are widely considered to be a mistake outside of one very specific circumstance having to do with test packages.",1443107475

Increasing the sample size decreases sampling error.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree with this at all. You always want to increase your sample size if possible. But as you also say, the magnitude of the effect you&#x27;re observing is also important; if it&#x27;s very strong, then it can be revealed by a small sample size. An absurd example could be &quot;cyanide capsules kill (n=2)&quot;. Obviously, the smaller the sample size, the harder it is to draw reliable conclusions, but I wouldn&#x27;t think n=19 is necessarily too small. I think many of phase I clinical trials aren&#x27;t much more than that.<p>More importantly, mentioning a &quot;small&quot; sample size makes a nice soundbite, and is often used to discredit studies. These studies might be good or they might not be, but talking about sample size can be used as a &quot;thought-terminating cliche&quot;. Perhaps a person is looking for evidence that reinforces their own beliefs (we all do it), and they read a criticism of a study, it mentions &quot;small sample sizes&quot;, and they can walk away happy in a belief the study was flawed. But all that&#x27;s really happened is that it&#x27;s prevented a proper discussion of the study taking place.

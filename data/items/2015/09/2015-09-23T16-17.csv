These are solved problems in angular 2 by default and have solutions in angular 1.<p>= Problem #1: Scope inheritance and dynamic scoping<p>Use directive controllers<p>= Problem #2: Dirty checking<p>Use immutability<p>= Problem #3: Dependency injection<p>I&#x27;m not really sure what the author is saying here. It sounds like he&#x27;s confused and thinks DI and modules solve the same problem.
The one statement he has bolded is completely false:
> Angular forces you to use a third, custom designed alternative mechanism: one that is inferior to the already existing mechanisms available.
You can use a module system if you want. Nothing is stopping you.<p>= Problem #4: Pointless complexity<p>> providers, values, factories, services, constants [...] All five concepts could easily be assigned a single identity.
True, so just use providers if that makes you happy. Angular 2 also simplifies things.<p>= Problem #5: Server-side rendering<p>He stated a solution for angular 1. Personally, I don&#x27;t really care about server side rendering so I won&#x27;t elaborate.
Angular 2 will have angular-universal<p>= Problem #6: Angular 2<p>> Not convinced yet? Well, what if we were to tell you that the next major version of Angular will take a scorched earth approach to the existing structure that means it will have zero retro-compatibility with what exists today?<p>> it would be simply foolish to use Angular 1.x for new applications.<p>LOL, fear mongering. The angular team has already stated there will be a migration path to angular 2. They also announced they will continue to support angular 1 as long as people are using it. It&#x27;s funny that he complains about angular 2 when it addresses his problems with angular 1.",1443027288
10266217,comment,10264894,10265103,0,0,paulmd,,,"That release is from 2002, which predates the introduction of Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel in the US (Cali switched in &#x27;06, the rest of the US switched in &#x27;10).  This drops the allowable particulate concentration from 500 ppm to 15 ppm, which as you would expect greatly reduces soot as well as emissions of all kind.<p>The diesel we were running back then was garbage.  It really had more in common with something like heating oil than the diesel the rest of the world uses, and is the reason why the US has a perception of diesel engines being dirty.  It also created huge problems for porting small diesels over from Europe - they run at a much higher compression, but at those pressures the particulates in the fuel become abrasive and eat away the fuel injectors.  Now we can use the same engine designs they are.  It&#x27;s win-win for everyone (except the oil companies I guess).<p>Also, biodiesel reduces soot and other emissions even further.  The only downside is that it has a higher gel point than fossil diesel.  In southern states you can get away with running straight B100, in more northerly states you need to mix in 15% fossil diesel to get the gel point back down (B85 fuel).",1443027258

To reason about the runtime behaviour inside A, you may have to reason about the expressions that consume the return value of A.

Write a decent sized Java application and you will have a ton of memory usage and perhaps space leaks as well. In a moderately complex C++ application, even the best C++ devs will have memory and space leaks.<p>I think the key here is that Java has JProfiler. C++ and C have Valgrind. Haskell has a heap profiler built right into the compiler. But Haskell doesn&#x27;t have any specific tools for thunk memory profiling. The discussion in the community is now around building tools and automating this process. It&#x27;s not like this is a fundamental issue.<p>Languages that have complex threading and locking also have to have more complex tools to debug these issues (ThreadScope in Haskell, VTune in C++).<p>What I&#x27;m trying to do is put these issues into context. It would be easy for a Python dev with the GIL to scoff at the complexities associated with C++ or Java threading and this is akin to what many do when looking at laziness. Laziness is a feature that comes with it&#x27;s own types of bugs and we simply need tools to manage and track down those bugs.<p>The breakthrough with Neil&#x27;s post is that even with current tools we now have a way to track thunk-based space leaks in Haskell and ideas for some more automation on the way.",1443026484

All you need to do is to rotate the subject so that the perceived acceleration is aligned with g, or keep it at an angle, to get a fraction of g. Interestingly, for VR you don&#x27;t need to simulate velocity, as it cannot be perceived by the body.<p>Flight simulators have been using this approach for decades now, and it works really well:

Instead of mobilizing people to action, it instead sends most people--like you--into apathetic despair.<p>Why? Because it&#x27;s easy to be apathetic. This is not a knock on you personally, it&#x27;s a statement on the human condition. Most people just don&#x27;t feel like they have the free bandwidth (time, money, energy) to take on a big ideological fight, particularly if they think they can&#x27;t win anyway.<p>But the truth is that the last 100 years of history is chock full of amazing stories of victories in just such fights.<p>I&#x27;m most familiar with U.S. history so I&#x27;ll just highlight a few:<p>- 100 years takes us back to the beginning of the modern labor movement. Viciously opposed by well-funded industry and government forces, it nevertheless succeeded in massively shifting social norms and installing numerous laws and regulations to protect workers. It is still a strong force today.<p>- 60 years takes us back to the births of the modern civil rights and environmental movements. Like labor, they were out funded by huge margins, but still changed the world through shifting social norms and numerous laws and regulations. Both are still powerful movements today.<p>- We only need to look back about 30 years to see the birth of the modern LGBT movement, whose victories are in our headlines today. That movement will undoubtedly continue to be a powerful force in American society for decades to come, at least.<p>Now take a look at those timelines... 30 years is the most recent. The tobacco victories were on a similar timeline. Nothing comes quick and easy when we&#x27;re talking about moving the opinions and laws of an entire nation. But is the fight winnable? YES!

They are totally artificial, so that they have nothing to do with normal car usage. But they are still used. The reason is, that particularly the German government are blocking all initiatives to change them. This does suggest, that they know about the cheating or at least where influenced from the big car industry. The German car industry is very influential in Germany.<p>Also it is a well known fact, that the gap between the official fuel usage figures and the fuel usage experienced in real world situation is growing and growing for many (maybe most) car brands.

For example, if you compute and store 64 bytes of PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256, an attacker needs to only compute the first 32 bytes to verify the guess, and with PBKDF2 it means doing half the work.<p>That&#x27;s a fair criticism. In that respect, a better design might have been to generate a seed S using the PBKDF2 core, then just spit out HMAC(S, 1), HMAC(S, 2) for the derived key. I don&#x27;t know if that would have had its own issues though; I&#x27;m not a cryptologist.<p>> In most common use (with HMAC), it inherits HMAC &quot;vulnerability&quot;: a password longer than the hash function block is equal to the its hash<p>True, but as you imply it&#x27;s really not a vulnerability. And it&#x27;s certainly better than limiting passwords to 56 bytes, as bcrypt does (with human-memorable passwords, 56 bytes <i>really</i> aren&#x27;t enough).<p>> - PBKDF2 is commonly used with hashes which are fast on GPU or custom hardware and require tiny memory, thus making defense/attack cost ratio very bad.<p>Sure, scrypt is better. But scrypt is not what &#x27;everyone&#x27; uses: bcrypt is.",1443025306

It&#x27;s kind of a philosophical question - do you want to see ads that are relevant to your primary interests at ALL TIMES, or do you want to see ads that are relevant to the interests of where you are. There are, let&#x27;s simplistically say, three classes of ads:<p>1. Old Internet - Pages curate and/or sell whatever ads they can possibly get. They are generally statically hosted assets.
2. Original Ad Networks - They don&#x27;t know anything about you, but it removes the need for pages to individually make ad contracts. You&#x27;ll get whatever ads are in the queue, possibly sorted by rough groupings; &quot;technology&quot; ads, etc.
3. Current Situation - Everywhere you go you are presented with ads relevant to your interests, regardless of your current site. Vogue might try to show SSD ads or car parts ads, even though that&#x27;s not the kind of content you would go to Vogue to consume.<p>I think there&#x27;s an interesting case to be made that clickthrough decreases can be at least partially attributed to the fact that as tracking increases the probability that the ad represents the content of the site decreases and becomes an even more unwelcome distraction. Sponsored content is a way to defeat this, and ad blocking, by making the advertising appear more in line with the content of the site (or is it making the content of the site more in line with the advertising?).",1443025233

10265881,comment,10263279,10265149,0,0,hanklazard,,,"Physician-scientist here. Current recs from the American Academy of Pediatrics is for both males and females to be immunized for HPV prior to initiation of sexual activity (1). Initially I do believe that the recommendation was only for girls but that has changed for two major reasons: increase herd immunity in the overall population and because men can also get malignancies and lesions from HPV. Of note, the vaccine does not prevent all HPV infections. The 4-valent vaccine covers the two most common cancer-causing HPV strains as well as two others that commonly cause warts.<p>As for whether a test like this would be useful in clinical practice, it would definitely depend on the situation. HPV is extremely prevalent ... by the time a person has been sexually active for a few years, it is almost guaranteed that they carry at least one strain of HPV (there are about 40-50 strains last I checked). However, most people never have any problems related to HPV, either because their immune system effectively suppresses the virus or because they have a strain that does not cause symptoms.<p>Is it useful for one to know that they carry a non-malignancy forming, non-lesion causing strain of HPV? Is it useful for 50% of the population to believe that they have an STI although it will likely never cause any clinical symptoms in themselves or any sexual partners?  I would say probably not. Is it useful to type the HPV strains of all infected patients? Maybe. Currently it would not be useful as we do not have effective antiviral therapies for HPV. However, understanding the epidemiology more clearly could certainly help as we decide which viruses to attempt to target therapeutically in the future.<p>I will say this: the test described in this article would generally be described as a &quot;fishing expedition&quot; in the lab where I did my graduate studies. These types of studies can be very useful in certain cases but I predict they may also cause a lot of confusion as we begin to find subclinical viral processes occurring in plenty of healthy people. As a society, we will have to change our perception of what it means to be &quot;infected&quot; with a virus and as a clinician, it may become more challenging to reassure patients that they are healthy (gut and skin microbiome data will likely create a similar predicament with regard to bacteria).<p>In any case, I&#x27;m sorry to hear about your difficulties with HPV. I see patients dealing with it on a fairly regular basis and it can be a frustrating situation. I do hope that there are effective therapies on the horizon.<p>1. <a href=""https://www2.aap.org/immunization/illnesses/hpv/hpv.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www2.aap.org/immunization/illnesses/hpv/hpv.html</a>",1443024444

I don&#x27;t like Angular&#x27;s heavy handedness, and I really really don&#x27;t like mixing JS and HTML (which rules out Ember or React).<p>I personally find Knockout to be almost the sweet spot.  Very lightweight, plays well with others, doesn&#x27;t &quot;take over&quot; or try to impose a top-down ordering on the page.<p>I know the rest of the developer world has moved on but I&#x27;m hoping I can hold on to using Knockout long enough until another MVVM system which separates view and model but binds them together comes along.",1443024182

  - unreliable
  - confusing UI: you need to know whether it was physically switched off or auto-powered-down to know how to turn it back on

Solving some of these, like by designing a better mechanical switch, might push things forward.",1443024122

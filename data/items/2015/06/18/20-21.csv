I know a thing or two about how shit works in the real world.  I know how it worked during low and high tax &quot;seasons&quot; and I know what decisions real business people are forced to make due to government meddling.<p>I am speaking out of real context having started and run companies with my own cash, having succeeded, failed, gone bankrupt and risen-up again and having created tons of jobs in my community.  I am not some asshole simply spouting off based on ideology.  I live this shit.  I am spouting off the reality every business person in this nation faces.<p>I am here to tell you that if you don&#x27;t understand why it is that our government has become the enemy of growth and progress in this nation you really need to gain a better understanding of how the world works.  Start a cookie baking operation with your own money and see what you learn after five or ten years.<p>Call me a troll.  Down vote my comments.  Call me a jerk and an asshole.  Do as you wish.  None of that is going to change the reality of what is going on around us.  Not one bit.<p>The government isn&#x27;t hitting Uber over the head to &quot;protect the little guy&quot;.  That&#x27;s pure bullshit.  They are protecting the unions that are threatened by Uber.  They are actively using anything they can to stop Uber because it threatens their own political gain.  Can&#x27;t you see that?  These politicians couldn&#x27;t give a shit about the little guy.<p>This isn&#x27;t about having zero regulations either.  Healthy controls are important, necessary and reasonable.<p>This is about government consuming OUR money efficiently, not growing beyond a reasonable size, not spending without accountability, working with us, not against us, not becoming the enemy of growth and progress.  Government does not have the right to meddle in every aspect of our lives.<p>The tax code is some 70,000 pages.  I&#x27;ve been in business for 35 years and I can safely say I can&#x27;t even begin to comprehend all of it.  It is humanly impossible.  Can you?  Please explain why we need 70,000 pages of convoluted rules to pay for the running of our government and services?  The only people who benefit from such a monster are the super-rich who can afford to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars per year for accountants to figure out how to pay less taxes.  The rest of us get screwed.<p>You seem to be so brainwashed by this idea that we need government for everything that you just can&#x27;t see it the other way.  There are few possibilities here:<p>- You are a unionized worker and, of course, will be pro-government all the way because you benefit from politicians pandering to you.  In this case you don&#x27;t realize what damage you are doing to our country in the long term.<p>- You are unemployed and supported by some government program.  I&#x27;m sorry that is that case.  I hope you find work soon and make that money available to support others that might have hit hard times.  This is important. We as a society must help people during hard times.<p>- You are a college student or just out of college and have been fed a steady dose of left wing liberal ideology that you swallowed hook-line-and-sinker.  Not much I can say to you other than, you&#x27;ve been indoctrinated and I hope you will, at some point in your life, see that the emperor has no clothes.  From my experience most liberal ideologs suddently see reality when they start a business and start to experience the consequences of some of the ideology they used to support.  I have many ex-liberal friends.<p>- You are a government worker.  Enough said.<p>- You are and have always been an employee.  You&#x27;ve never been an entrepreneur at scale.  No, publishing an app in the app store does not expose you to the realities of how government meddles with business.  There are a lot of little businesses (graphic design, consulting, freelance software dev, etc.) that can escape the nasty experience afforded to manufacturers, food processors and a whole layer of businesses deeply &quot;touched&quot; by government.  There&#x27;s nothing wrong with being an employee or having operated a small business outside some of the nasty stuff government can do to businesses.  Nothing wrong at all.  That said, if that is your case, you have to be honest enough with yourself to understand that you simply do not have the context necessary to understand the issues and even begin to discuss them.  Arguing about something you don&#x27;t understand would definitely make you a certified troll.  It&#x27;s like me arguing about open heart surgery with a practicing cardilogist because I read a few articles about it.<p>As one of my favorite sayings goes:  A man holding a cat by the tail learns something he can learn in no other way (Mark Twain).<p>There are other angles here, but in my experience someone who doesn&#x27;t agree with the idea that government has gotten out of hand simply isn&#x27;t exposed to the realities some of us see every day.  Nothing wrong with that.  Congratulations,  But don&#x27;t pretend you know what&#x27;s going on because you don&#x27;t.",1434661064

9741568,comment,9737554,9738906,0,0,adamtj,,,"> O(length of string) per step<p>The big win here is not that it&#x27;s as fast as the optimal algorithm (it&#x27;s not), but that it&#x27;s nearly as fast and vastly simpler.<p>You&#x27;re technically right that the given code is O(n^2), but the optimization discussed later in the article can easily be applied to turn that into O(nk).  Further, for the lucene problem, k=2.  That&#x27;s small and effectively constant, making it &quot;basically O(n)&quot;.  That&#x27;s still theoretically worse that optimal, but in practice it just doesn&#x27;t matter.  Even with the slightly slower algorithm, Lucene&#x27;s cost of searching should be dominated by repeatedly _using_ the DFA and not by _building_ it.<p>What&#x27;s really important is that the O(nk) construction algorithm is much simpler than the optimal version.  I don&#x27;t know what the Lucene guys were originally trying to do, but if they had figured out this method instead, they could have avoided the super complicated implementation of the true O(n) algorithm.<p>> you can also implement the dynamic programming approach for a pair of strings in O(nk) time<p>Yes, but that&#x27;s for every pair of strings you want to test.  A DFA costs exactly as much to build as solving a single problem with DP, but when a large number of pairs all have one string in common (the query string), a pre-built DFA can be used repeatedly in only O(n+k) each time.  Of course, whether that&#x27;s enough to make a practical difference depends on the problem at hand.",1434661013

9741562,comment,9741072,9741072,0,0,pavpanchekha,,,"I saw this talk at FCRC/PLDI. It&#x27;s both very impressive and very well-presented. What follows is what I gathered from the talk; I haven&#x27;t read the paper but it&#x27;s on my reading list. The basic idea is that the old notion of a polymorphic inline cache can be nicely generalized to erase away metaprogramming like method_missing or descriptors.<p>PIC is a way to speed up method dispatch. Normally, if you call a method foo in your program, but you don&#x27;t know the class of the object you&#x27;re calling foo on, you need to go look up the appropriate code to run in a virtual table or similar data structure. This is slow, because you might do this lookup very often. PIC means caching this lookup in the code that calls foo—basically adding an instruction like<p><pre><code>    if (obj.class == CACHED_CLASS) CACHED_CODE()\n</code></pre>\nThe reason this helps is that we can do the test quickly, and the branch predictor will predict it very well; then our JIT can inline CACHED_CODE, perhaps optimize it against the other code nearby, and now we have nearly-optimal machine code. After &quot;warm-up&quot;, in other words, we&#x27;ve dynamically inferred the type of obj and have optimized our machine code to take that into account.<p>Now on to meta-programming. Suppose instead of calling a method on an object we are instead instantiating a class object which is dynamically determined. PIC isn&#x27;t exactly applicable, because it&#x27;s not like the type of the class object is in question (the class object&#x27;s class is probably Class or something). Instead, this paper proposes caching the identity of the class object, and the caching the initialization code and optimizing around it. You could do the same for things that override method_missing and similar, to cache all the decisions those overrides are making and then allowing the JIT to inline the code.<p>Their evaluation suggests that this method works <i>really</i> well, almost eliminating all of the overhead from meta-programming. This isn&#x27;t too surprising: we know that even dynamic features are usually used in very &quot;static&quot; ways, that JITs are really good at finding these ways, and that after warming up JITs can usually optimize away all that dynamism to get very fast code.<p>I am kicking myself for never having thought of this, despite having read several of the PIC papers. I am not a big believer in meta-programming, but this work is simple, extremely useful in practice, and also deepens our understanding of a technique both theoretically and practically.",1434660968
9741561,comment,9737177,9739318,0,0,pdglenn,,,">  giving landowners farther upstream and closer to the waterworks greater ability to extract water<p>This is not exactly correct. Water rights in the west are governed by prior appropriation. It&#x27;s in a sense first-come, first-served, but has to do with who first made &quot;beneficial use&quot; of the water, not who is farther upstream.<p>&quot;Disputes arose when newcomers made diversions upstream from existing operations, because water was so scarce that dividing the flow among multiple miners could make it useless to all. Early farmers faced identical conflicts. The solution, through much of the West, was a new conception of water rights whose central tenet was “first in time, first in right.” Proximity to the source counted for nothing, because miners and farmers sometimes had to move water long distances. The critical factor was the date of first use.&quot;[1]<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/25/the-disappearing-river"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/25/the-disappearin...</a>",1434660966

JS is a dynamic language, in full it needs JITting, speculative optimization based on runtime profile feedback, statically unsound type inference rescued by dynamic checks that have low-enough cost.<p>In contrast, wasm is for C and C++ first, and in due course many languages. The C/C++-first design point is a way of limiting scope creep and catering to important native-code use-cases (games, AI, CV, etc.). It&#x27;s the starting point, not the final state. But it involves the usual static types trade-off that reduces runtime overhead.<p>Therefore a full JS engine in wasm would not run very fast compared to today&#x27;s in-browser JS VMs, which are evolving to be JS/wasm VMs. For dynamic languages to compile to efficient wasm, we&#x27;ll need the future JIT-generated wasm support and other desiderata on the roadmap.

Which implied that the input images were just compositions of simple geometric shapes - a circle within a rectangle, two circles intersecting, etc.<p>When I tried &quot;recalling&quot; the learnt image after every few X epochs of training, I noticed the neural network was &quot;inventing&quot; more complex curves to better fit the image. Initially, only random dots would show up. Then it would have invented straight lines and would try to compose the target image out of one and more straight lines.<p>What was absolute fun to watch was, at some point, it would stop trying to compose a circle with multiple lines and just invent the circle. And then proceed to deform the circle as needed.<p>During different runs, I could even see how it got stuck into various local minima. To compose a rectangle, mostly the net would create four lines - but having the lines terminate was obviously difficult. As an alternative, sometimes the net would instead try a circle, which it would gradually elongate, straighten out the circumference, slowly to look more and more like a rectangle.<p>I was only an undergrad then, and was mostly doing this for fun - I do believe I should have written it up then.

And nothing is stopping you from writing a simple app in ES7, running it through babel, and shipping it.  You could think of it as an updated compiler or switching to PyPy.<p>You probably do want a build step to lint, minify, and concatenate your code, and (if targeting the browser) to turn modules into something the browser can deal with.  Which basically means webpack (or gulp+browserify), but much like a traditional Makefile (which is basically all it is), you write the webpack config once and then you&#x27;re done.<p>And finally you probably want a framework, and probably a package manager to install it.

I have no problem that our 1%+ chargeback was an issue for Stripe who have to keep Bank/VISA/MC happy. Also, it&#x27;s ok that they didn&#x27;t want us as a customer. Stripe has as much right as any other business to choose their rules and customers. I just told our story as a complement to the creator of this thread for other users of Stripe to know what could happen. Stripe is not a golden bullet for credit cards online as often told in the tech community.<p>Now, what did bother me enough to comment at all?:\n1. We always send in detailed papperwork for each chargeback. Never heard back for any of these during our time as a customer. Not once!\n2. We never got any indication that we were getting close to some limit resulting in being cut off, just the email saying byebye in 10days (or whatever it was, maybe 7?) just as everyone in the office went on a 4 day holiday (bad luck I guess). 10 days is not even close to enough to set up with a new processor for SaaS-products if you need an import of old customers and have any to speak of amount of charges going on. It triggers a lot of extra papper work.\n3. Payment processors claim SaaS is high risk as there is no product for proof of delivery. Stripe has all our money for months and a full refund policy makes it low risk in my eyes. We pay extra for this hassle anyway.\nIf they say it&#x27;s a risk, ok, Stripe knows better I hope. We had very long going ID identification so fraud was never the issue, just people trying to get money back and ashamed of asking it from us directly.\n4. Stripe dealing with 1mil+ euro yearly of our money and refusing to speak on the phone even regarding major issues. Emails with &quot;tough&quot; questions always disappeared into thin air. It feels weird to not being able to contact someone that have your balls this way.<p>PS: Our &quot;high&quot; 1-2% chargeback spiked sometimes as customers that had made 10+ transactions during a year could start a chargeback for all transactions. Never spiked above 2%. Also, the product attracted many lazy and not-so-tech-savy-people, very far from the typical tarsnap user (which I&#x27;m a long term user of).\nNot defending our chargeback-rate, just that we know why as we phone up each user after a chargeback to get an understanding.<p>Long comment, hopefully it clears out my thoughts for those interested.",1434659494

Great as those are, by continually making one- or two-of-a-kind devices we are endlessly prototyping. What if we picked one or a few different designs, selecting for greatest generality, and then worked to get the costs very low by manufacturing a lot of them, <i>accepting</i> that they will be suboptimal for almost every target?<p>Of course crappy probes would give crappy results, and many of them would fail altogether. But what if we deployed <i>hundreds</i> of cheap crappy probes on a regular basis - ie build a shotgun instead of a series of sniper rifles? Obviously finding a good general-purpose design is easier said than done.<p>We have I think 3 lunar probes in orbit at the moment, and a few more on the way, as well as various probes that have gone to the moon, sent back a bit of data, and then crashed into it by design. That&#x27;s not very many at all. The moon&#x27;s not that far away, why not try putting 50 low-cost probes around it with the same instrumentation and see what we learn from that? If we can get better astronomical observations from arrays of relatively low-power telescopes, surely we will get better planetary observational data from arrays of low-quality probes? Simply getting an array of probes up there and running and learning hwo to handle the networking, data flow, and and the inevitable variety of unexpected failure modes will provide us with a vast amount of experience, not to mention a vast amount of additional data about the moon that can be benchmarked against a whole lot of excellent data we have already for accuracy.<p>I don&#x27;t mean this as a dig at you or the other commenters critiquing this proposal, but you remind me of Thomas J Watson suggesting that  &quot;I think there is a world market for maybe five computers&quot; (not withstanding the apocryphal nature of this quote, similar sentiments were expressed by other experts around that period, eg <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_J._Watson#Famous_misquote"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_J._Watson#Famous_misquo...</a>).",1434659113

Because consumer protection for all kinds of non-delivery, mis-delivery or simple misunderstandings is actually more important for everyday purchases than all the advantages of an independent cryptocurrency. And of course, widespread availability, liquidity and value stability are just non-optional table stakes.<p>Bitcoin on its own is not competitive as a replacement for the full payment infrastructure. Bitcoin together with a widespread trusted escrow system, reputation system and a (currently unavailable) legal framework could fit the role, but in that &quot;Bitcoin++&quot; the missing parts are larger and more complex than the Bitcoin core implementation.",1434658097

So here are a few of the highlights of the paper:<p>- They looked at nearly every single twin study over the last 50 years<p>- The combined population of the all the studies is 14 million twin pairs<p>- The results strongly suggest that every human trait is heritable as they didn&#x27;t find one trait that had 0% heritability.<p>- The most surprising result for me is that across all the traits they compiled, the heritability is 49%. Which is much much lower than I would have expected.<p>There&#x27;s a few more interesting points about monozygotic vs dizygotic, but I&#x27;ll spare you the technicalities since it has a narrower scope of interest.<p>As always, thanks Gwern for the informative post.",1434658096

9741269,comment,9738254,9739867,0,0,zamalek,,,"> postmortem debugging tooling is extraordinarily valuable for production problems<p>When all else fails this is really all you are going to have to go by. Coming from the Microsoft side of the story I have come to a conclusion that any sufficiently well designed postmortem debugger is a few steps away from being a live/production debugger. Windbg, as a prime example of this, can be used to debug memory dumps, live processes and remote (TCP) processes using <i>exactly</i> the same debugging tools binaries (and scripts/plugins that you write).<p>Debuggers have to be the biggest source of friction, for me, when adopting things like Go. If you are in charge of &quot;production&quot; you can throw in a few printlns, however, you can&#x27;t just approach someone like the HP and say &quot;can I put this debug binary on your production system?&quot; No, the absolute best you can hope for is a memory dump and those memory dump had <i>better</i> count as you are only going to get maybe a few.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s because not many devs deal with this kind of stuff, which is probably why it isn&#x27;t a top priority for things like e.g. Go. To some of us, though, the most important language of a feature is easily the quality of the debugger associated with it.<p>Either way, great slides Bryan - it&#x27;s nice to see at least one &quot;modern&quot; language taking these issues seriously.",1434657844

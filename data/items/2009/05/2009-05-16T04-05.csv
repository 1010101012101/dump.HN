This (mostly) satisfies the loudest screamers... ""I HAVE TO RUN MY IM CLIENT TO GET IMs!!!""<p>It's all speculation from here on out, but...<p>Second round: Background Music.  Apple will provide some API so applications like Pandora can play their music in the background.  This will necessarily entail some amount of background processing to be allowed, but I'm sure it will be heavily curtailed.<p>Third Round: Limited ""full"" backround support.  Who know what this will look like, but it will probably be something like the user can select N apps to run in the background<p>By the end of the third round, hopefully the hardware and battery technology will have advanced enough that Apple will allow any app to run in the background",1242449832

611883,comment,611799,611870,0,0,jedwhite,,,"I think it is a radically different model. Part of its founder friendly focus is precisely that it doesn't make people give up other work and move somewhere full-time. The use of warrants rather than (fairly or unfairly) articulating valuation by providing tiny seed funding as part of a stock deal avoids the question of pre-seed valuation, and it encourages the best eventual valuation possible.
It has some very interesting ideas.",1242449367

611876,comment,610950,611744,0,0,neilk,,,"I don't think your comment is offensive, and I get what you're saying -- you would prefer that all of humanity be inspired by what one of us does. Regrettably this is not the case.<p>People identify more with people that look like themselves. This is a bug in the human OS and we can't ever totally fix it. Even if we could somehow fix that, there are good reasons why someone will gauge their own chances based on the success of others who are similar to them, especially in a society that's still working on eliminating racial and gender disparities.<p>Let me take an example closer to home. Paul Graham's theory about Y Combinator was, among other things, that people were ready to found successful companies at a much earlier age than was previously suspected. He has pretty much proven this by now, and I know lots of bright kids who are ready to take the startup plunge.<p>But think of how people felt before -- ""I can't start a company, I'm just a college kid"" or ""What do I know about business, I've just worked in a coffee shop"" or ""The people who start computer businesses have to be really smart, I don't even have a degree yet."" or even if they do think they have the skills, that ""nobody is going to trust a kid like me, the game is stacked against me. Forget it."" And there is even the worry that one might succeed, but then be totally alone and alienated from all your friends.<p>If the barrier is that high just for ageism, consider how much higher it is for sexism and racism. And people grow up and leave their youthful inexperience behind; you can't do the same with gender or ethnic background. Think how much more mental fortitude it would take to try to succeed in a profession where you'll always be the odd person out due to your gender or color. Knowing that someone's blazed the trail for you becomes very important.",1242448991

611874,comment,610896,611097,0,0,bwd,,,"Not correct, the taxes are actually paid by the receiver and not the payer.  If the receiver is in a lower tax bracket, then they pay taxes at that rate.  This is basically all factored in to the process of setting alimony by the courts, so pretax and post-tax don't really make any sense here unless the tax brackets are different.

Anyway, why should someone's view be more valid because they have a vested interest?<p>I do find plagiarism and copying that is not properly attributed, or that is not necessary very annoying. Why do people copy and paste text from my website to Wikipedia, Scribd and other places? Why not just link? Why not attribute properly.<p>Most sites are pretty good at dealing with this - A Wikipedia editor spotted it a copy and paste and took down the content before I got round to complaining, but Scribd seems to go out of its way to make it as difficult as possible (written DMCA notices only).",1242448786

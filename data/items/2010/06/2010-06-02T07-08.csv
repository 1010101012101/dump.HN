- what you dislike about existing FPGA tools
- what you'd want in FPGA tools; and
- whether we're building would be useful<p>Here's our take:
1) Dislikes:
- Being forced to choose a specific FPGA before compilation(synthesis, place-and-route etc.) when I don't even know which FPGA suits my application.
- Installing, maintaining, upgrading bulky software tools on local PCs.
- Taking weeks/months to learn a particular tool from just one FPGA vendor.
2) Wants:
- Ways to automatically match an FPGA app to the right FPGAs.
  - in terms of speed, size, power, etc.
- FPGA tools hosted and updated somewhere else.
- A single user interface that translates user inputs for all vendors' FPGA tools.<p>Existing tools don't seem to do these things, so we started building a webapp with the above features.<p>Ran the idea by the folks at YC and they had questions about how useful our webapp would be after the FPGA programming files are generated and the user needs to test on real hardware.

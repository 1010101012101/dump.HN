Everyone is in a rush these days to be the first with the most click-baity headline, accuracy be damned.  They have zero fucks to give about the repercussions of what they publish and it is downright shameful.  The more people allow weasel words to be acceptable in news, the more they&#x27;re willing to accept narratives and not objectivity.  I genuinely despise Dropbox, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they deserve falsehoods blasted about them.  We live in the disinformation era and it has and will destroy many arguments, careers, companies, and lives.  Shameful.",1413269925

8452255,comment,8450040,8450229,0,0,asgard1024,,,"I think you missed the point. The big question is, what is &quot;one computer&quot;? It surely isn&#x27;t just one atom (one point in space). Is something running on a CPU with several ALUs a distributed system? Is something running on a multicore server a distributed system?<p>So it seems, distributed systems are not defined in terms of spatial or logical distribution of &quot;stuff being done&quot; (because everything is distributed in this sense), but rather by assumption of (un)reliability of the links between the components, and the choice of components. And this may depend on your vantage point, too.<p>So if that reliability is good enough, you don&#x27;t need theory of distributed systems, and it all makes the system more efficient. In that sense, Dropbox is more efficient than P2P solution because you have hidden assumption (from the user perspective) that Dropbox servers will always be available.<p>Edit: Also reliability of components plays a role. Thinking about it more, it really seems to be a question of hierarchy. Distributed systems are less hierarchical than the centralized counterparts; there are less bottlenecks (that may fail) but more coordination required. So the OP is basically arguing that some hierarchy scales better than no hierarchy.",1413269826

For each item in every bedside table, every piece of furniture, every picture, every computer, you had to put aside the memories the deceased person may have had, the reason the deceased held onto the item until the end, the data contained within and make a split-second decision: box or barrel.<p>Barrels were massive rusted oil drums that we used for collecting garbage. Boxes were used to transport the salable &quot;smalls&quot; for auction. If you were caught considering the saleability of an item for too long you&#x27;d soon hear your boss&#x27;s voice from across the room, &quot;barrel it!&quot;<p>One time I came across a pair of filing cabinets filled to the brim with research and lecture notes on Egypt and the hieroglyphics. I had already pieced together parts of this person&#x27;s life to form an image of them - old-money spinster who traveled the world lecturing and having adventures, including sneaking in to China from Hong Kong in 1976 - and their life work was contained in these filing cabinets.<p>&quot;We can probably get fifty bucks a piece for the filing cabinets; barrel the rest&quot;<p>For a team of three, two hours per room was budgeted, so everything that was dear to a person over the course of their 70-year life would usually be processed within two days.<p>Regarding hoarders, the main differences between a dead hoarder and a living one are 1) the fact that you don&#x27;t have to deal with the emotion as per the OP, and 2) there is no superficial &quot;cleanup&quot; the day before the cleaners arrive. The house is exactly as the hoarder left it as no-one thinks the day before they die, &quot;If I were to die tomorrow I&#x27;d be <i>aghast</i> if they found this!&quot;<p>I know this sounds ridiculous but I would expect a living hoarder would at least manage to dispose of the bucket of feces and used tampons next to the couch if they knew some cleaners were coming. Even hoarders have pride, y&#x27;know.<p>The house with the bucket of tampons was the stuff of legend. Even today, 15 years later, if I were to contact my former boss for a beer it wouldn&#x27;t be long before the story of that place came up. Along with the tampon-and-poo bucket, the final defacation of the former resident in the sweat-crusted outline on the green velvet couch where the they had spent their final moments is still a vivid memory. The stench, using shovels to scrape up the person&#x27;s life from where it was stuck to the carpet and fill barrel after barrel, my boss&#x27;s sense of humour (&quot;whaddaya suppose she used <i>this</i> for?!&quot;), how quiet everyone was on the ride back to the office, showering for an hour afterwards.<p>Understandably, after working this job for a while I went through an extremely minimalist phase. Even now I pause before most non-consumable purchases. I keep nothing that I wouldn&#x27;t want someone finding when I die.<p>I think while many hoarders fear the memories of the past being forgotten, HNers tend to fear being forgotten themselves.<p>Of course as per the OP, there were good parts to this job too! The pay, for starters, was decent. And discovering some bondage equipment or some naked polaroids of the former resident and their girlfriend was always good for a chuckle and a reminder to stop taking yourself so seriously and enjoy life a bit more.",1413266721

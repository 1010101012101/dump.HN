In my case, 99% of the ideas I will probably never take action on, so it&#x27;s a bit weird to track their phase. Instead I have separate lists for how big the idea is, how much time/energy it would take to implement.<p>Then the order in the list defines how attracted I am to actually doing the idea at the moment. So for example, making a Facebook competitor would be in my &#x27;big ideas&#x27; list, but all the way at the bottom, because I think it&#x27;s not very likely to end well.<p>I browse over my ideas every now and then, and update the ideas with information about how I would go about implementing them if I chose to. I usually move ideas up the lists when they come back in dreams or I find myself thinking about them during the day.<p>I have a few ideas I am actually doing work on (architecting, exploring, programming) and I move them to a separate &#x27;doing&#x27; list.

I am a student in Italy too! We are lucky to have such a cool passion, every day I feel really graced and lucky. One of the best things is that our profession does not have a location and the culture is so vast! Uni has tought me really little! especially italian uni is really retro. Do you want a school? GitHub is your teacher. Learn to understand source code and contribute to it.
With regards to connecting people: many think that a programmer has to live in his lab and, to be more focused, isolate himself. That is complete nonesense! I find myself so more creative and driven when I do completely unrelated things. When I come back from a trip I feel that drive of innovating because I have seen so many things! You solve problems if you don&#x27;t have the problems.
I hope this helps, as an italian too I understand you. Do not get dissapointed.<p>TL;DR

If a pizza delivery order got messed because of a bug in the web service, the result would be that you won&#x27;t have any pizza today for example (which is acceptable). But when it comes to software that affects lives, and when it&#x27;s being advertised in the media (of course with the patronage of the author) as a secure solution, then it&#x27;s a big problem that could really affect many people. You can&#x27;t think long or short term in these issues, you have to take the immediate consequences into consideration, you have to shock the users into knowing how bad the problems are. I&#x27;m sure the intention for such harshness is not directed towards the author, but in fact towards the community of users relying on this piece of software. Imagine learning that TOR is insecure or compromised for example, that would mean a very hideous end for many activists around the world. I really mean hideous as being persecuted, captured, tortured, and eventually killed. That is something that should be stopped in any way without giving any second thoughts to feelings, or &quot;strong developer environment&quot;.<p>From a technical point of view, nothing could be said about the author, because this is how software is, weather it&#x27;s proprietary or open source.

  ~$120 to restore it all (that was a back of the napkin figure before I started)

Arq has a number of good things to recommend it. The creator lurks around here, which is always nice to know. The design is very sensible - it&#x27;s basically a git index on S3 with the data blobs in Glacier. The storage format is open and documented. All the data is encrypted using your own key locally and then pushed to your own AWS account. It works out really cheap if you use Glacier (only planning on restoring in catastrophic circumstances).<p>It all just works. The interface is easy and intuitive. I pushed my data to the EU region since it&#x27;s closer. The more I think about it the happier I am with my choice at the moment.

This is my theory explaining why NPEs are not a timesink for me.<p>You never know when you have enough coverage to rule out NPEs or any other bug. And to get confidence about lack of NPEs you want to have coverage of all lines involving dereferences, which means you need near 100% test coverage to have a reasonable level of confidence. With Haskell, I can be reasonably confident about my code with very little tests.<p>> but I&#x27;d wager that it wouldn&#x27;t be as readable as the equivalent written as a test.<p>Generally types are far more concise and guarantee more than tests.

Languages with nulls, and mutable shared state are perfectly reasonable to use if programmers do the right thing by convention<p>I think Scala users will generally disagree with you. They&#x27;d prefer it if null was ruled out in the language itself.

Here it is...<p>&#x27;Martel wrote:<p>&#x27;In New Zealand the actions of the governments domestic spy agency (the GCSB) is governed by law. Clearly there are very good reasons why the powers of such a government agency should be limited by the law. There are certain things that government agency cannot do. Actually it is more properly said that the GCSB must not do certain things, because for them to do so would be illegal, in other words those actions would be criminal, in other words those actions would constitute a crime. Sorry to be so pedantic but some seem to have a real problem with the idea that the rule of law pertains to all, including government agencies.<p>&#x27;When the GCSB spied on Kim Dotcom their actions in doing that were against the law. Yet, the author(s) of this Washington Post article attempts to sanitise and trivialise the illegal actions of the GCSB by calling them a misstep, quote unquote. Is that the euphemism you use to describe all crimes? A misstep?<p>&#x27;Let me make it clear to you that the GCSB knew what they were doing was illegal. Further more it is known that the Prime Minister was at a meeting where the question of its legality was raised. They knew that what they were doing was against the law and you choose to characterise it as a kind of OOPS. It was not an oops, it was a premeditated crime committed against a New Zealand resident by a government agency. Why do you seem to have such a problem calling it what it actually is? A crime. A crime has been committed and a New Zealand resident has had his whole life and that of his family practically destroyed and you call the criminal actions that brought about this egregious situation a misstep. Your characterisation of this is simply defies belief. To whoever wrote this article, if this is the best you can do with this and if you honestly cannot see the gravity and greater significance of what has happened in this important case then you have no right to call yourself a journalist?<p>&#x27;All around us right now so many of we, the people, are increasingly alarmed at the outrageous and unlawful intrusion of governments into our lives and the compromising of our freedoms by them and yet you seem to want to characterise this as a trivial matter. A crime has been committed by precisely those who should have known better and yet the government tries arrogantly to simply set it aside, to ignore their complicity or (with the assistance of articles like this one) to restyle it as in, it was all just a misstep. Can you even begin to justify your position here? A misstep? Give us a break.&#x27;",1372928959

There wasn&#x27;t 10 stories about the libertarian case du jour, but equally there wasn&#x27;t a flood of interesting compSci stories. I guess my memory is selective!<p>><i>That makes no sense. Except if you take it to mean: the guys that were there earlier don&#x27;t get what they like anymore, and more (and newer) people get it. Which is a pretty hipsterish sense (&quot;Oh, that band was cool when only I liked it&quot;).</i><p>I really can&#x27;t agree with this. In 10 (12?... Getting old I guess) years of online participation, I&#x27;ve seen time and time again relatively small forums and websites grow in user numbers and the quality of the popular submissions/threads/posts decline.<p>Perhaps a good example is Reddit. At one point it was a site for submitting links to news articles. The userbase was fairly heavily skewed towards tech and programmers. Looking at Archive.org from 2007 the front page is perhaps 1/3 programming related, 1/3 &quot;interest&quot; articles and 1/3 current events. There&#x27;s not a single link to an image.<p>My belief is that when a site grows in popularity, and so the interests and backgrounds of the users expands, the posts that consistantly attract more interest or votes are those which appeal to the largest common aspect of the community - the community itself. Once Reddit was large enough to have its own in-jokes and themes, submissions related to those tended to receive lots of attention. I think many people enjoy belonging to online communities with injokes, and so once it started that shift the demographic of new users changed as well. In 2007 nobody would have strongly defined themselves as a &quot;redditor&quot; in the way that people do today because at that point it was nothing more than a site for sharing interesting news articles.<p>As someone who enjoys reading thought provoking articles (and sometimes commenting on them), I find it frustrating to  see websites I like move towards lowest-common-denominator submissions. I&#x27;m no fan of &quot;it was better in my day&quot; baseless nostalgia, but Archive.org provides us a fairly effective window into the past and it is clear that many sites are today demonstrably different than they were a few years ago. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s elitist (or &quot;hipsterish&quot;) to want to maintain the spirit and submission quality that was the basis for this sites popularity.",1372928745

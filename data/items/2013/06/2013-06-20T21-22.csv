To make matters worse, I was responding to a comment he&#x27;d made a long time prior to my comment, making myself even more of a doofus, and giving jwz more powder to use against me.

He&#x27;s not using an unrelated character assassination to discredit an argument.  I concede that it smells a bit ad-hom-y, but only because he has a lot bad to say about the article (all of it supported, imo), and so it kind of builds up momentum.  That&#x27;s the article&#x27;s fault, though, for being so wrong about so much (although the article is right that WP is a complex (social) system, not perfectly documented).<p>(A related mistake, which I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re necessarily making, is that of thinking that anything that attacks credibility is AdHom.  If you say &quot;Bob is always wrong about biochemistry, so he&#x27;s probably wrong about this claim about haemoglobin&quot;, that&#x27;s not AdHom either.)<p>As for the second, your inference might have been reasonable (if uncharitable), except that he later explains exactly why he brought it up: the AfD process has to operate at scale, it&#x27;s not expected to be infallible.  Combined with his other points about how notability has to work, it&#x27;s build-up for his paragraph that starts with &quot;Anyone who can snark...  betraying a deep ignorance ...&quot;.<p>And I think it&#x27;s a pretty decent comment, overall, because it has a virtue I prize, of looking at a wrong-but-seductive view, and giving enough additional context to help readers form a better picture.

Not because it wouldn&#x27;t be technically feasible for the consumer to abuse the system, but because the barrier to actually owning the games they want to play would be so low that it would become the new path of least resistance.<p>The sky&#x27;s the limit if the industry can learn to treat their customers with respect.<p>Edit: By the way, a version of games sharing already exists on the PS3. If you purchase a game digitally on PSN you can install and play it simultaneously on multiple PS3s as long as your account is on each of them, I believe up to a limit of 5 PS3s.",1371765363

Modern warfare has elements of both chess and poker (and others of course, but roll with me here). The chess elements come from accumulating threats and counterthreats and so on which are all important, even if they never manifest. For a clear real-world example, look at the North Korea standoff, which has frozen the same basic threat/counter-threat model in place for decades; North Korea can not win a war, but they can cause more damage then its worth before we can destroy their ability to damage South Korea. It&#x27;s a very &quot;chess&quot; situation, only there&#x27;s no clear endgame. The problem is that in the context of those games, the computer players aren&#x27;t smart enough to engage at that level of strategy; at most, if you build up a large force you&#x27;ll make them &quot;nervous&quot; and they unconditionally attack, and that only for game balance reasons, not realism. The computer players are not able to take in a complicated situation and understand it deeply enough to participate in truly modern power struggles.<p>Your last suggestion is game unbalancing; in that case, everyone will simply be in a perpetual state of open total warfare, from the instant you start that bonus.

I see the HN participant posting this story is new here, making his first article submission.<p>Some of the comments surprised me, as they seem to assume that antibiotics as a category of substances are only a few decades old. In fact, many of the first antibiotics in clinical use were &quot;natural&quot; substances, namely mycotoxins secreted by fungi in an endless chemical warfare arms race for living in a world full of bacteria. The reason that antibiotics are useful for human medicine is that fungi are much more biochemically similar to animals (like us) than bacteria are, being our comparatively near evolutionary cousins as fellow eukaryotes, and as such they are naturally selected to produce antibacterial mycotoxins that may be highly effective against broad groups of bacteria while being largely harmless to most animal tissues. But as the article notes, and as we would expect from evolution by natural selection, various strains of bacteria have been selected by differential survival to be more or less resistant to current antiobiotics.<p>Silver as an adjuvant for antibiotics may have some clinical usefulness. The research reported in the article here is laboratory rather than clinical research. There are many more steps to take before knowing whether or not this is a useful approach for human medicine, including carefully controlled clinical trials of safety and effectiveness. The reporter who wrote this news brief was careful to interview another scientist who warns that silver is toxic to human tissues as well as too bacteria, so dosage will be a crucial issue.<p>The obligatory link for any discussion of a preliminary research finding like this article is the essay &quot;Warning Signs in Experimental Design and Interpretation&quot; by Peter Norvig, LISP hacker and director of research at Google, on how to interpret scientific research.<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>Check each submission to Hacker News you read for how many of the important issues in interpreting research are NOT discussed in the submission. Here we still need to wait for actual human clinical trials to know if the addition of silver to antibiotic treatments will have adequate safety and effectiveness.<p>AFTER EDIT: I&#x27;m going to an appointment for my children, so I&#x27;ll be away from the discussion for a while.

It goes more into the radical innovation (for academia) of the authors&#x27; process:<p>&quot;But more importantly, the spirit of collaboration that pervaded our group at the Institute for Advanced Study was truly amazing. We did not fragment. We talked, shared ideas, explained things to each other, and completely forgot who did what (so much in fact that we had to put some effort into reconstruction of history lest it be forgotten forever). The result was a substantial increase in productivity. There is a lesson to be learned here (...), namely that mathematicians benefit from being a little less possessive about their ideas and results. I know, I know, academic careers depend on proper credit being given and so on, but really those are just the idiosyncrasies of our time. If we can get mathematicians to share half-baked ideas, not to worry who contributed what to a paper, or even who the authors are, then we will reach a new and unimagined level of productivity. Progress is not made by those who break rules.&quot;<p>&quot;Truly open research habitats cannot be obstructed by copyright, profit-grabbing publishers, patents, commercial secrets, and funding schemes that are based on faulty achievement metrics. Unfortunately we are all caught up in a system which suffers from all of these evils. But we made a small step in the right direction by making the book source code freely available under a permissive Creative Commons license. Anyone can take the book and modify it, send us improvements and corrections, translate it, or even sell it without giving us any money.

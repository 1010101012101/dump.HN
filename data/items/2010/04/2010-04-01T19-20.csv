Most will just get frustrated after several tries and then leave. By not having a country field in the first place, you're telling these people that they needn't bother, you won't be wasting their time, and then everyone is happy and won't be writing angry blog posts about it.",1270151955

James Holdren says that ""what went on in the way of manipulation of data, that remains to be seen"", yet opposes any actual probe. Barbara Boxer is only interested in criminal charges against the climategate whistleblower.<p>From the WSJ: ""In the House, the Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming held a hearing on what Chairman Ed Markey said was 'the urgent consensus view . . . that global warming is real, and the science indicates it is getting worse.' But the only witnesses were officials from the Obama administration, who support dramatic action on climate change. Republicans asked to have a global-warming skeptic appear but were denied."" (<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704342404574576021674770950.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405274870434240457457...</a> )<p>In the larger picture beyond climategate, Gore once said ""I believe it is appropriate to have an over-representation of factual presentations on how dangerous it is, as a predicate for opening up the audience"" (see <a href=""http://www.grist.org/article/roberts2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grist.org/article/roberts2/</a> ). This is a little out of context, but in the context of what we now know about the distortions taking place, it's quite ominous.<p><i>Self-defense:</i> Umm. You don't know what you're talking about. Carrying a semi-auto weapon is certainly self-defense. But the question is much broader than that. Here in New Jersey, as a matter of policy, it's impossible to get a carry permit for <i>anything</i>, including mace.<p>The fact is that there's a concerted attack on any form of defense, at least in parts of the country, and it extends far past even what some people feel are evil weapons, even to weapons that are clearly of <i>only</i> defensive use.<p>What does ""current social consensus"" have to do with it? This seems to be circular reasoning, the argument reduces to saying that ""those holding the power say so, and that's sufficient justification"".<p><i>Takings:</i> This has nothing to do with Apple. What did your preceding comment have to do with Apple?<p>My point was that ones right to ones own property is certainly a civil right, and one which the Democrats trample with great abandon.<p><i>Hate speech:</i> It seems to me that this isn't complex at all. ""Slippery slope"" might be a lame argument in general, but it turns out in practice that these laws are used <i>more often</i> to silence unpopular speech than to protect anyone from any real harm.<p><i>Choose your evil:</i> My personal actions have no bearing on whether politicians singly, in parties, or across the board, are evil.<p><i>If our current politicians can be called ""evil"" as a group, then the word has lost all currency.</i> You sound like a victim of BDS syndrome, the very kind of person who says that GWB is <i>so</i> evil that <i>anyone</i> else ought to be elected, just to get that evil administration out. (And, of course, there is a mirroring group ODS-sufferers now). But such actions are precisely what give politicians to be evil. They can be as evil as they want, right up to 1 unit less than whatever they can convince others is the evil of their opponent.<p><i>Blind to ones own side:</i> Huh? What an amazingly self-centered response. Why in the world would you think I was talking to you specifically? If it matters, the answer is no. I'm talking much more broadly. That should have been obvious from my example of the phenomenon way over in China.",1270151734

Even if his brother is a great designer, if he makes a mistake, both of you will be hesitant to say anything.<p>It sucks, but clients are supposed to be tough on designers so that they get whatever they want.<p>There's also a reason people go to school for design, or have years of experience. An ""eye for design"" is not enough for a professional site. UI design and efficient navigation don't just happen by drawing a pretty-looking menu.",1270151669
1235266,comment,1235190,1235190,0,0,jeffmould,,,"I am assuming that the design at <a href=""http://licead.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://licead.com</a> is your partner's brother. Based on that I think with a little editing and some input from everyone that you can have a good starting point. I can appreciate you wanting the best design for your company and do believe that a website says a lot about the company, but it sounds almost as if you have ""site envy"". ""Site envy"" is when you look at designer's portfolios and say ""WOW"" I wish my site had that, looked like that, or did this. ""Site envy"" can lead to an endless cycle of designs and redesigns because you keep finding things you like ""better"". ""Site envy"" can stall a business.<p>With an unproven business venture without revenue you should evaluate your spending carefully. A website does not have to be AND should not be a static piece of your business. Like your business your site should evolve as the business evolves. The cost of $600-$1000 now may seem like a little money now, but three, four, six months down the road if you are struggling for revenue to pay bills that money will seem like millions to you.<p>You and your partner are a team and as such should work like a team. Although the designer is his/her brother, most likely your partner is only looking out for what is good for the business now and in the future. You should treat the relationship with his brother as if it were a professional designer. Create a contract, lay out terms, clarify expectations, maybe even throw a little equity his way upon completion. Do all this even if he is creating the site for free.<p>Going back to the initial design at licead.com, like I said, I don't think it looks bad at all. It could use a little cleaning up here and there, but I think that by sitting down with your partner and his brother that you can probably come up with something that has a professional look/feel that will get your started without looking like crap.",1270151643

But with the added advantage of massive community support.<p>Sinatra (and Ramaze) also have the advantage of having been thoroughly tested and have a lot of eyeballs on them. Using Padrino (and perhaps Monk) creates the risk of (a) encountering framework boilerplate code that is buggy and (b) not having enough help to fix those problems because of insufficient resources on the part of the creators or insufficient community support.<p>That said, the documentation is impressive and attractive. The only suggestion I would make is the reduce the size of the downloadable screencast - no need for a 210MB video file for 12 minutes of video.

The entire appeal of the iPad isn't, 'This can do a great many of the things that my computer can already do!' it's, 'This makes it so much more pleasant to do [X] than it is on a computer!'<p>So every new feature that we see demonstrated isn't just filling in a little bit more of the difference between an iPad and a netbook; it's bringing the experience of the iPad to the tasks and behavior we're looking for.<p>This is the way that innovation happens, even though a lot of people don't realize it. They're stuck in the old mode of innovation, the King's Quest VI mode. The first time I saw a CGI video playing off a CD-ROM I was blown away by the capabilities of computers. By now I know what computers can do, and I have seen enough CGI video to be pretty well-convinced that anything I want can be rendered by it. Likewise, we have enough technologies at our disposal right now that we could spend a long, long time improving the software that we use simply by designing better interfaces for it. If you wait around for an entirely new technology—something that isn't possible on your laptop, like Star Wars-style holograms—you're gonna miss several boats.<p>To put it more directly: there's surely some people who have already ordered the iPad who will be thinking, 'Oh, nice. There's another thing I can use it for.'

1235155,comment,1234460,1235055,0,0,tbrownaw,,,"> * Amazingly, contrary to everything you'd expect about ""secure DNS"", DNSSEC does not in fact secure DNS queries from your machine. Instead, it delegates securing DNS to DNSSEC-enabled resolver servers. For securing the actual queries your computer makes, your browser is on its own. There's a whole different protocol, TSIG, intended to address that problem.<p>The stub resolver (library that provides gethostbyname() and friends to your browser) can in fact verify the DNSSEC signatures itself:<p>> <a href=""http://www.cricketondns.com/post.cfm/securing-dnssec-s-last-mile"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cricketondns.com/post.cfm/securing-dnssec-s-last-...</a><p>>   In particular, stub resolvers can set the CD bit in a query.  The CD (Checking Disabled) bit tells the recursive name server not to validate DNSSEC-signed data on behalf of the resolver, but to return the various DNSSEC resource record types, such as RRSIG and DNSKEY RRs, so that the resolver can perform the validation.<p>> But no common stub resolvers implement their own DNSSEC validation, so CD is rarely used.<p>I expect this will be fixed in rather short order once there's a reason to fix it (say, all the major zones are signed and there's a semi-standardized DNS-as-PKI record type). Actually, I see a 'libunbound-dev' in the debian repositories already, which looks like a validating DNS resolver library (along with unbound-host and a couple other associated packages). I'll have to go play with this...<p>I also see discussion from 2003 about this, regarding wheter ""stub resolver"" is an appropriate term for something smart enough to validate the signatures (but apparently no claims that the end-user resolver shouldn't set the CD bit, just what to call that resolver): <a href=""http://www.ops.ietf.org/lists/namedroppers/namedroppers.2003/msg01509.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ops.ietf.org/lists/namedroppers/namedroppers.2003...</a><p>> * DNSSEC has zero successful real-world deployments, and no existing integration with any TLS stack. DNSSEC obviously does nothing to secure your actual traffic; all it does is try to protect the name lookup. TLS protects both.<p>Kinda hard to have a ""real-world deployment"" without the root signed... that said, there are some signed zones and there is <a href=""https://itar.iana.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://itar.iana.org/</a> .<p>The idea is to have a way to use DNS as your PKI rather than a horde of independent CAs. TLS would still be used and work about the same (I'm guessing the only difference would be to check cert hashes against a DNS record instead of checking the signatures against a list of CA signing certs, not a protocol change at all).<p>How can TLS between you and a server protect the DNS lookup you use to locate that server?<p>> * DNSSEC does nothing to address all the other intercepts, from ARP to BGP4, that real traffic has to contend with. Once you go from name to IP address (or ""cert"" in the fairytale world where DNSSEC has replaced the CAs), you're on your own. TLS addresses all of these issues except for CA configuration.<p>...which can be addressed by using DNSSEC as a PKI.<p>> * DNSSEC actually reduces  the security of DNS in some ways: in order to authenticate ""no such host"", DNSSEC publishes a sort-of-encrypted list of all your hosts. There's a whole other standards group drama surrounding the proposals to resolve this problem (NSEC3, whitelies, etc).<p>Not relevant, and apparently sufficiently resolved that there's a timeline to have everything signed within a couple years.<p>> * DNSSEC fails badly compared to TLS. When keys inevitably get screwed up in TLS, you get a browser click-through. There is no API support to recover from a ""gethostbyname()"" failure caused by DNSSEC. This sounds like a reliability problem, but it's actually a security problem, in the same sense as ""the little blue key icon isn't big enough"" is a security problem for SSL. We just don't know what the exploit is, because nobody has designed the ""solution"" for this problem.<p>Huh? People don't care about their TLS keys getting screwed up, because people will just click through that screen (security problem!). If people can't even find your site when your keys are screwed up, you'll actually care about making sure your keys are right.<p>> * TLS has 15+ years of formal review (it is the most reviewed cryptosystem ever published). We still find things in it. DNSSEC has received nothing resembling the same scrutiny. It's ludicrous to believe we won't find horrible problems with it. You'd be asserting that a protocol co-designed by Paul Kocher will eventually fare worse than one designed by the IETF DNS working group. The IETF DNS working group would basically have to crush  some of the smartest practical crypto people in the world.<p>...DNSSEC is not in any way supposed to replace TLS, that would make absolutely no sense. But it can replace the CA infrastructure, with the result of making TLS (as commonly used) more secure.<p>> In the '90s, we designed web security to assume that DNS was insecure. That was a smart decision. ""Security"" means different things to different people. It's a policy decision. The end-to-end argument strongly suggests that it's something that can't be baked into the lower parts of the stack. DNSSEC is a step backwards. I think you can already see the indications of the problems it will cause just by looking at the places it already falls down.<p>How can it fall down, when it hasn't been set up yet? And how can ""I know that this data is not forged"" possibly be a step <i>backwards</i> from ""this data could very well be fake, it's been known to happen""?",1270148713

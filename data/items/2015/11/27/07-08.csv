10636352,comment,10635864,10636219,0,0,BinaryIdiot,,,"> You have to look at the 0.2% in relation to the salary that they offer<p>I disagree. Salary is a real thing that you can use today. Options at a start-up? Some studies indicate that start-up failure is at 90% within the first 3 years. This means those options, 90% of the time, don&#x27;t mean anything. They&#x27;re literally useless.<p>The other 10% of the time? Depending on percentage, dilution and exit (IPO? Sale? Neither?) it&#x27;s still difficult to get a return on those options in any reasonable timeframe.<p>In my opinion you should NEVER sacrifice salary for options UNLESS it&#x27;s an established company where you can see how to get your money out of those options. There is a TON of competition out there for talent, if a company wants a quality candidate they will pay for one.",1448611157

There&#x27;s no scientific basis to suspect GMO of causing harm to anything. Your suspicions are based on a big company being involved and oh my god it&#x27;s made by people. Nature good, people bad. I don&#x27;t share this sentiment. Aflotoxin is made by nature, it is bad for you. Very very bad. It occurs in everyday food. GMO has been shown by research to mitigate the presence of aflotoxin. GMO is a product of people. If they put GMO labels on stuff, I will be happy, because I will eat the GMO stuff.

By this same simplification, the cost of a loaf of bread ($2.50 for 1.25 lbs) is relatively high compared to the price of wheat ($4.77 for 60lbs). But we know that there are many hidden costs to get us from wheat to bread. Add to our gasoline usage the external effects of Co2, safety, and the influence on the housing architecture -- the price of oil doesn&#x27;t seem to be a particularly accurate measure of true cost.<p>>You are ignoring both state taxes<p>I ignored state tax hikes on fuel because they haven&#x27;t haven&#x27;t been particularly active.<p>• Twenty states have gone a decade or more without an increase in their gas tax rate.<p>• Fifteen states have gone two decades or more without a gas tax increase.<p>• Among the thirty-one states levying a “fixed-rate” gas tax, the average length of time since the last gas tax increase is sixteen years. [0]<p>>and state expenditures on roads.<p>State expenditure on roads is precisely what I&#x27;m attempting to draw attention to -- the states don&#x27;t make enough in gas taxes, they have to spend from their general budgets and raise bonds. Several states have now reached the point where the cost of servicing debt for past projects now soaks up nearly all current revenues from gasoline taxes.[1]<p>>A federal gas tax is a regressive tax on urban poor to pay for rural highways.<p>Absolutely it is. But subsidizing the urban poor&#x27;s use of cars doesn&#x27;t help their situation either -- it just leads to more roads and less investment in public transportation. Public transportation is more efficient and benefits the poor and middle class, and makes roads less congested and safer for people who can afford to drive.<p>Additionally, mandated parking takes up valuable real estate in urban areas, driving up the cost of living. This negatives effects the working poor. [2]<p>>States like California take more money in on gas taxes than they spend on roads, so force states to maintain roads instead of funneling the money through Washington DC.<p>Current revenue from California&#x27;s 42.35-cent gas tax covers only a fraction of the state&#x27;s annual highway repair needs.

It wasn&#x27;t that long ago that people were shocked that &quot;Mom&quot; was on Facebook. In 2010-2013, the conservative networks (news sites, social network cliques, forums, etc.) really started to form. As an example, Twitchy (a fairly popular conservative &quot;news&quot; site made up of embedded tweets and commentary) was founded in 2012.<p>There&#x27;s always been Libertarian and right-wing internet users, but now it&#x27;s reached the same fever pitch as the left-wing outrage machine. It&#x27;s no longer just Libertarians talking about how the government is the source of all evil, or an alt-right conspiracy theorist, it&#x27;s that Jane Sixpack can now access the internet just as easily as a college kid.<p>I suspect the bulk of people on the internet used to think the outrage machine was a bunch of well-meaning idiots. But when it&#x27;s the extreme Republicans (who were previously a tiny minority on the internet) pulling the same shit, it starts to be obvious why this is a problem.",1448608338

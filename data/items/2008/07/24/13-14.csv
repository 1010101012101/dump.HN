You realize that they live in a different world, without all the chatter.<p>I'm not implying that what we're doing is going to shake the foundations of the planet, because it won't -- simply relaying what I'm thinking about as we work.",1216907884

A 10 oz. Jack 'n Zac helps me get through the meetings without one of my students winding up with his severed head in a bowling-ball bag. They look at me funny; they think I twitch a lot. I'm not twitching. I'm controlling my impulse to snag my 9mm Sig-Sauer out from my day-pack and make a few strong points about the quality of undergraduate education in Amerika."" --Olin Shivers, from the scsh manual ""acknowledgements""",1216907826

255324,comment,254951,254951,0,0,wallflower,,,"Andy Baio (waxy.org), said that Pixar has the right of first refusal when it comes to employee projects. If an employee wants to work on something of their own, they have to go to Pixar management and tell them about it before starting. In case Pixar would be interested. Usually they say 'no' and get full approval to work on their own project (at home).<p>Contrast this enlightened approach to employee IP agreements and other murky waters at typical companies (even startups).",1216907746

But considering the players involved at the time and their general lack of vision, it would have taken many more years to establish open interconnection standards if it was purely a private effort.

Also, notice that most of them have less than 100 followers (as opposed to the pied piper Scobelizer-types 5k+ followers and Scobelizer-wannabees 1k+ followers). It would be interesting to see the distribution of followers on Twitter. My hunch is that as Twitter goes more mainstream there will be more normal people (with 20-30 followers).",1216906146

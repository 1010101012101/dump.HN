Ideally you have a job that challenges you enough to fill your time...  but in any case.  <  < <<USE THAT TIME>> >  ><p>- Write a book about a cube dweller in your position that on lunches and in down time he is saving the world with a team all controlled from his work PC where he is doing ""nothing"". Apparently that might be an untapped market judging by the response here.<p>- Find a problem at work, solve it, sell that.<p>- Create a community or site/product for one of your hobbies, even it is is knitting.<p>- ???<p>Morale of the story is, find a way to build something of value with this time.  That something might help you, your like minded peeps, or even your company (although you might have to get reinforcement externally before you sell anything internally, I find this route works best).<p>Just do it son! And don't feel too bad if you try to contribute and it is knocked down.  Have everything as dual purpose for your own and possibly your company's good.  But make sure it has some of your own in it.<p>You have the power to create value.",1229063658

Remember computers 20 years ago vs. today?  Most people were surprised at the increases in computer price performance, but not those who understood Moore's Law.  The same thing will probably happen in solar energy.  Try to look surprised.  :-)",1229063427

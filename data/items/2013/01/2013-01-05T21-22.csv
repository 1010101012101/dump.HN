There aren't many companies that have zero web development at all these days, but there are plenty of roles / divisions at these companies that don't involve working on the web stuff. My employer (MokaFive, see the previous hiring thread) has me doing Linux packaging and integration work and hardware enablement, crypto, filesystems, mobile development, etc. (Yes, that is a ton of things; see also, we're hiring.) Google and VMware, mentioned elsewhere in the thread, have tons of roles that don't touch the web. Most hardware manufacturers want driver developers. Apple is doing a bunch of compiler work, a bunch of OS development work, and so forth. Microsoft isn't killing desktop Windows and Office anytime soon (and the online version of Office is certainly not ""glorified web development"", if by that you mean CRUD apps in Rails). And so on and so forth.<p>These roles exist by the bucketload in the Bay Area, in Boston, in New York, etc. etc. I'm pretty confused why you're not finding them.",1357423091

5014203,comment,5013409,5013409,1,0,Zenst,,,"I disagree with the articles conclusion.  It does make some good points about costs and how a dedicated tool is better but if we just go back a little in time and look at laser printers and other types of home printing over using a comercial print shop and you see alot of parralels, ink cost being one that still holds with us today, even with `major` players in the feild.<p>Another way to look at this is people today spend alot of money on craft tools and materials and we even have dedicated shopping channels for such products.<p>Finaly I think if you look at the cost of lego brick and the respective volme of 3D ink, then I suspect you will see that 3D ink works out very comparable and cheaper in many area's.  People spend a lot of money on Lego and with that alone the market for 3D printers has a place.  Not saying rip of Lego bricks but that people like to play and create things and whilst Lego is targeted at children it still endures with many a adult.<p>Initialy with the costs of a good printer that can use robust 3D ink we will see your local printers embacing the new avenue and many other outlets offering a 3D printing service.  The home consumer market will grow, costs will drop but.  As I said with the initial introduction of laser printers and other printing types, initial they were expensive, but only got better and cheaper and permuated into more purchsing budgets/needs over using your local print shop.<p>With markets most people will work out the direction and then end up dooming it all as it does not happen as quickly as they can think about it.  Markets are funny slow beasts that operate on various timelines and with new technology the initial market is the niche that opens the crack or not into larger markets.  I certainly see a larger market given the ever expanding craft market and with the same insight into how laser printers started and ended up at, let alone coloured printing, which was many years ago the work of a dedicated print shop.<p>ALso worth remembering that industry today has milling machines and flow-jet which will take a solid block of metal and turn it into your defined shape.  3D printing is not metal and with that is targeting different markets and we are a long way from the univeral replicator perception most seem to think 3D printing is.  That is a long way off, heck how long has it taken to get the perfect monitor, close but still not there as a ideal.  But they sell and with that the ability for somebody to print out a 3D object be it a chess set, replacement part for some broken plastic bit in a product that you can't replace without purching the entire module/section.  Many DIY tasks would have a use for such an item, even customised plastic washers, so many usable area's even with todays technology.<p>So that is why I disagree with the conclusions as they are based upon a ideal with todays limitations impossed and not taking into account printing technology adoption within markets historicaly, let alone the bleed over markets in craft, DIY and many more others will probably be aware of.<p>For me the acid test is when you can print out a plate, knife and fork and use them to eat with practicaly and saftly as good as disposable cutterly today.  Then we have a robust enough technology that consumers will start to embrace if the price is right.  I also expect the 3D-ink's will follow inkjet prices, but the printers will carry a margin until the saturation is at the level which enables a large company to make enough margin on the ink over the printers.  It will be when all printers end up offering more or less the same functionality at various price points at comparable levels to other manufacturers.",1357422701

It starts at 11:20 and runs through 12:20.<p><i>""Follow your passion.""  We've been talking about it here for the last 36 hours.  ""Follow your passion"" -- what could possibly be wrong with that?  It's probably the worst advice I ever got.  ""Follow your dreams and go broke,"" right?  I mean -- that's all I heard growing up.  I didn't know what to do with my life, but I was told that if you follow your passion it's gonna work out.  I can give you 30 examples right now.  Bob Combs, the pig farmer in Las Vegas, who collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos and feeds them to his swine.  Why?  Because there's so much protein in the stuff we don't eat, his pigs grow at twice the normal speed, and he is one rich pig farmer, and he is good for the environment, and he spends his days doing this incredible service, and he smells like hell but God bless him.  He's making a great living.  You ask him: did you follow your passion here?  He'd laugh at you.  The guy's worth -- he just got offered like $60 million for his farm, and turned it down, outside of Vegas.  He didn't follow his passion!  He stepped back and he watched where everybody was going and he went the other way.</i><p>This makes absolutely no sense to me whatsoever.  For starters, it's completely clear to me that Rowe is totally passionate about the work he has been doing for <i>Dirty Jobs</i>!  (If that's not clear from this short segment, watch the whole video.)  I don't know that in his youth he would have been able to <i>identify</i> this work as his passion, but it seems clear enough to me that he has, as an adult, found it -- if not ""the"" passion of his life, then certainly ""a"" passion.<p>His story about the pig farmer makes no sense to me either.  How exactly can we conclude that the pig farmer isn't following his passion?  I'd say that the fact that he doesn't want to sell his farm is evidence that it <i>is</i>, in fact, his passion, and the clever way he's found to feed his pigs, to me, supports that conclusion rather than contradicting it.  Where is it written that no one could possibly be passionate about pig farming?<p>And tucked in the middle of all this is the line ""'Follow your dreams and go broke,' right?""  Again -- where is <i>that</i> written?  I've <i>never</i> assumed that following my dreams would lead to penury; quite the contrary.<p>Rowe is thus an example of a curious phenomenon I've noticed -- people whose passion seems to be telling other people not to follow their passions.  (Cal Newport is the other example that comes to mind.)<p>The only explanation I can come up with is that these people don't really get what a passion is or how to identify it.  I suppose that to the extent that there are a lot of people out there who don't get that, telling them not to follow their passions is, for them, sound advice!  But I find it rather unsatisfying.",1357421609

Under normal circumstances, different teams will have different standards, and by the time you realize this you'll have a lot of teams whose standards have slipped, and you will have a lot of marginal employees.<p>Therefore smart large companies try to create a minimal process that aims to create uniform process across the whole company.  The process tries to be lightweight as possible on individual people, but fights the good fight against entropy.<p>Unfortunately for Rachel, Google's process centers around the idea of having well-calibrated interviewers whose interview characteristics had been so well tested against others that hiring committees know exactly what to make of their interview feedback.  (What absolute scale you grade on does not matter much.  How your scale compares to everyone else, and how well it predicts everyone else, does.)  Once an employee winds up as a well-calibrated interviewer, HR would like to use that person as much as possible (and each use does a better job calibrating the employee, and increases their desirability as an interviewer).<p>This is inconvenient for the employee to whom it happens.  But, on average across all developers, the process is quite light-weight.<p><i>Instead, the formal interview processes I've seen are gauntlets of trivia and case studies and successive whiteboarding exercises that exhaust everybody. They don't generate value proportional to their cost. And they're unsustainable, so that whatever marginal effectiveness they have is compromised totally within a year when everyone who participates gets sick of it and starts phoning things in.</i><p>Google's process has been sustained company-wide for a number of years now.

5014101,comment,5013162,5013605,2,0,yk,,,"The answer is perhaps somewhat technical, but hopefully this shows the argument why heat flows from negative to positive temperature.<p>Entropy is essentially the (logarithm of) the number of states a system can be in, without changing the macroscopic observables. These states have all the same probability. The second law of thermodynamics is then simply a consequence of the number of allowed transitions of the system. And temperature is the change of the number of states if energy is added to the system.  That heat flows from the lower (positive) energy to the higher is then a consequence of calculating the probabilities, as is the observation that heat flows always from a negative to a positive temperature system.<p>Perhaps a example will make this somewhat clearer: 
Think of a chain of 20 capacitors, each can be charged or uncharged and I call the 10 left capacitors my left subsystem, and the 10 on the right the right subsystem. Initially there is 1 charged capacitor in the left and 3 in the right. Then the probability that after one charge moves there are two charged capacitors in each subsystem is 9/16 ( since 9 of the uncharged capacitors are on the left). In this case the temperature is positive in both subsystems. (The number of possible configurations of the left 10 capacitors is higher for two charged ones ( 5*4) than for one charged ( 5).<p>The negative temperature case would in this analogy be, if in one subsystem there are more than 5 charged capacitors. Then there are more charged than uncharged capacitors, the number of allowed states would decrease if I add additional charge. ( I can distribute 9 charges in 10 different ways, but 10 charges just in one way.)  But nothing happens about the argument of transition probabilities. If there are 7 charged capacitors on the left and 2 on the right, then after moving a charge the probability that there are 6 and 3 charged ones is 8/11 ( 8 of the 11 uncharged capacitors are on the right).<p>In the case of the boiling water and the negative (close to zero) system it is the same, it is about counting possible states. And since in one the number of states increases if I add energy ( the temperature is positive) and in the other the number of states increases if I remove energy ( the temperature is negative), both have a preference for transferring energy from the negative energy system to the positive one.",1357420803

They are providing a lot of software components that save effort for those who use them.  The results are platform specific, but everyone who uses them knows that and chooses to make that tradeoff intentionally.<p>What you describe as ""VM-managed library bundling"" sounds a lot like ""building your own platform out of open source parts and maintaining a compatibility layer to your target platforms"".<p>That strategy works for a few of the largest most-well resourced projects - e.g. the browsers Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera etc, plus the Adobe Suite, and even these draw criticism for the results not being as good as they could be if they focussed on one platform.<p>Something like this works on the web too - where people assemble a 'platform' out of javascript libraries - because the base platform simply doesn't provide enough.<p>I don't see it being a viable strategy for a small team or an individual developer trying to build native applications though because of the amount of time you'll spend keeping the compatibility layer up-to-date with the rapidly changing underlying platforms.",1357419821

5014040,comment,5012590,5013017,9,0,nateweiss,,,"I can sympathize. I dated online for a time, and the stated-height-requirement thing used to drive me either totally, totally nuts or into extended moments of depression, depending on the day. I am not very short, but I am under average, and I was really blown away by the sheer number of women whose stated requirements ruled me out on the basis of height alone. I think the percentage of women who actually write that kind of thing down might really surprise folks who haven't seen it themselves. This stuff can you depressed real fast (the classic lyric ""pretty women out walkin' with gorillas down my street"" comes to mind), and not just with respect to dating or women. For instance, wall street or other ""money"" types are very frequently quite tall, and very seldom short. Not saying that there aren't exceptions, but when you are sitting around thinking about your height it sure can be annoying! :)<p>(Then again, I bet the fact that sooo many men overtly state that they are looking for someone up to but no older than their own age probably amazes/dumbfounds/exasperates the ladies just as much.)<p>At the time, I eventually realized that the main thing that the women were saying was that they wanted a man taller than their own height--not necessarily taller than other men. (There were a lot of descriptions in their profiles like ""must be taller than I am in heels"", which always seemed like a clever way to make the ""requirement"" sound sexy btw.) Anyway, the point is that there are plenty of short girls around, and I went out of dates with a number of very attractive ladies who were shorter than I. Nothing in particular came of it, but I generally had a good time and never felt like I had wasted an evening.<p>A friend of mine has done lots of research in an academic capacity in this area (using source data from dating sites, speed dating services, etc), and one thing that has been proven rather definitively as far as he is concerned is that ladies behave differently when they are in a ""competitive"" mating situation such as a speed dating event, bar/club, etc. All the things they say they want in a man (stable, nice, smart, funny) go out the window and they just go for whoever is ""hottest"". Dating sites appear to trigger many of the same behaviors. But if you look at who they end up with long-term, it's a whole different set of factors that matter (again, not necessarily what they say to themselves or others). I can't provide any source links for this research, and I am massively paraphrasing from memory, but these are, I think, legit gists of some pretty legit findings unless my memory is doing me a terrible disservice today.<p>As the risk of offending USA-born females who might be reading, I would suggest perhaps trying to focus on ladies from other lands, as from my (all caveats about small sample size noted but notwithstanding) personal experience, the literal-minded ""list of requirements"" is somewhat of an American-girl-next-door phenomenon. My girl is from one of the lands down under and is the find of the century (and physically well out of what I had perceived to be my league). We are delightfully married in a ""soul-mate"" style and couldn't be happier. I spend many a moment disbelieving my own luck. FWIW, she is just about the exact same height as I am.<p>[Edit: I missed that you're from the UK so the USA-biased part of my post here is questionable at best. Sorry!]<p>I mention my wonderful wife not to brag, hopefully, but just to point out there are so many exceptions to whatever evolutionary/social programming we have (so much noise amongst the signals) that the rules only matter in the aggregate, not to the individual. At least that's my experience, one shortish geek to another. :)<p>My armchair analysis of my friend's papers, my own experience, and other reading is that both men and women have an elaborate system of truths and deceptions in our heads about what we are looking for in a mate. Many women have this annoying height thing and a bunch of stuff about income (sometimes masked, sometimes not). Many men have similar stuff about age, measurements, etc. Both are, I believe, about trading up genetically--so that our imagined offspring will have a genetic advantage in successive generations. But those are ""10,000 foot view"" ways of initially identifying potential mates when faced with a big group of them (like ""all the guys on this site"" or ""all the chicks in this city""). On a one-on-one level though, it's a whole different story--a whole different set of things can trigger that ""my genese might be able to trade up here"" response. And meanwhile, our conscious brains are doing their own thing--getting intrigued, falling in love, etc--which are using a much more sophisticated type of modeling than the crude "">= meanHeight"" gating that we think it might be from looking at the ""hard"" evidence.<p>Anyway, the main reason I wanted to post a response here was to respond that:<p>1)Yes, yes, a thousand times yes the ""height thing"" is a real thing. It feels and appears to be a glass ceiling. 
2) It is really frustrating, so frustrating that it's tempting to write the whole enterprise off as the realm of the tanned and shallow. 
3) But, as demonstrable as the rules appear to be--the evidence right in front of you--they are illusory and don't actually apply. That's my experience anyway.",1357419760

3688554,comment,3687828,3687828,1,0,donnawarellp,,,"I have often thought that life is self limiting. For example, yeast is a living thing, it consumes sugars and it's waste is ehtanol and eventually they all kill themselves off by drowning in their own waste (which, I guess later over a meal I will be enjoying a glass of yeast pee, but I digress). From a molecular perspective, human DNA is not that different from yeast, and at a macro view our behaviour is not that different either it seems. Perhaps all sentient life is destine to the same fate, perhaps it is a law of nature. I recall reading about an argument that Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorne have regarding time travel. Stephen Hawking argues against time travel because we have never met any time travellers from our future. Maybe time travel is theoretically possible, but like yeast, we do not as a species survive long enough to develop the necessary technology. ugh, sorry to bring everyone down, might as well have a glass of yeast pee.",1331409549

3688548,comment,3687865,3688409,1,0,mkaufmann,,,"Ok, in that regard I think your post was very informative. Raising awareness of this language detail is very important, because it can lead to bugs which are very hard to detect.<p>The two most valuable advices from your post is directly the first line (but I have to admit that I overread it the first time I looked at the post). And second to use some tooling like the Eclipse code checker or findbugs (which was mentioned in another comment) to make implicit conversions visible to the programmer.<p>The only point I still disagree, though this is only a minor point, is that even with your explanation the possible solution of creating seperate instances is really no help. My point beeing that either you know that autoboxing occurs at a point and one can handle it correctly, or one doesn't know and in that case you also can't create seperate integer instances. This is from the point of view of someone who worked most of his career with Java and that line just makes my eyes bleed. But I can also understand if this looks like nitpicking to others ;)",1331409441

3688410,comment,3688098,3688301,1,0,EdwardCoffin,,,"I'm afraid I don't know C++, so I can't offer any suggestions there.  I can recommend that you take advantage of the type system, since you have one, to enforce constraints in your data structures rather than enforcing them in code.  By this I mean (for instance) that if one object can have a relationship with any of a subset of the rest, strive to make it impossible for that object to relate to one of the other objects.  In Java one would perhaps do this by making those objects implement a special interface, and having the one object relate to things with that interface.  I know C++ has an equivalent (pure virtual classes?), but I don't know what it is.<p>One caveat is that it is quite possible to take this advice a little too far, and wind up with an overly complicated object model.  It's a fine line, and quite hard to see where it is.  I know that early on, I used to have a lot of simple object models whose constraints were enforced in code which seemed easiest, but much later in the project it made the program overall much more complicated, because as I built more and more code to manipulate the model, I found I was repeatedly having to enforce constraints that I might not even remember properly (or worse, not enforcing them at all, and encountering runtime errors due to situations that shouldn't have arisen in the first place).  Later, I tried for more complicated models, but occasionally got paralyzed in attempting to capture every single constraint in a hugely complicated model.  There's no principle for seeing the line that I can see, just painful experience.<p>If you have a C++ guru or mentor, try to get them to recommend a good C++ codebase with a good data model that you can use as a reference.  If you can get one, you might study it carefully and contemplate the way they designed the model, considering what the alternative representations were, and what consequences would have arisen from using one of these alternatives.  If you can discuss them with a guru, so much the better.  I'd say this is how I learned the bulk of what I know (or think I know) about the design of object models.<p>One of the most influential experiences in my career was integrating a third-party framework that was under development into my employer's system, also under development.  This meant that I didn't do much coding of my own, instead I was regularly taking new versions of the third party system, and figuring out how to weld it into our constantly changing codebase without changing either too much.  To do this I had to spend a lot of time studying both systems and talking with developers and designers on both sides.  I learned a lot from that.  Fortunately, the designers of both systems (of the parts relevant to me, anyway) were really talented, and strove to do things the right way, even if it meant throwing things away or slipping the schedule a little.  To this day I will often solve design problems by thinking back and theorizing how the designers of those systems would have done it.<p>I should also mention that the final redesigns I mentioned in my previous comment were almost always the result of my taking my hard-won lessons of the first month or so of coding, and sitting down for a week with a pencil and paper and just drawing object relationship diagrams instead of coding.  I'd draw the diagrams, then mentally go over the various tasks the program would have to perform, imagining how it would manipulate the object model I had drawn before me.  This exposed many flaws very early in the process, preventing me from doing much unnecessary coding.  You can use a semi-formal methodology here (like UML, but without all of the formalism - you just need to have a clear way of representing object hierarchies).  Simple boxes and lines are fine too.",1331406087

I intended this post to be more of an illustration of what autoboxing does.<p>With regards to your comment that the solution is not to create separate integer instances - I was attempting to show that this is a possible solution to autoboxing headaches rather than 'the correct' solution for testing integer equality, because the objects are not cached. Sometimes you want to use == for valid reasons, the problem I had was because I wasn't vigilant enough in checking my own code and used == when I shouldn't have used it in the first place.<p>Perhaps this post could have been written more clearly - but as it happens, you're spot on.

Then after reading your post, I commented on a technical topic (audio and hearing) which I know a lot about.  I still got negative feedback.  My viewpoint was too informed for this site, and one or a bunch of high-powered HN toughs started slamming my post(s).  If, as you suggest YC/HN locks accounts due to negative points, these guys were locking me out of my account.<p>Net effect:  censorship.<p>The more I posted, the more I got slammed (I didn't know at the time).  So the more resident bullies pick arguments, the more they can pick on you.  It's a natural downward spiral.<p>Net effect:  heavy, inexplicable (to victim) censorship.  Bullies get jollies.<p>Bottom line:  victims are censored from even supporting their points, bullies get the pulpit free and clear (i.e., they ""win"", and the readers lose), and bullies get more points to bully (I assume).<p>That's degenerate and broken for a news site.  Just the opposite of what's needed in an open, honest communication channel.<p>But it's worse than that.<p>-=-<p>At first I thought I was locked out for 30 seconds or so as you suggested, and I was able to keep my draft posts open for posting later.  But YC/HN lockout proceeded for somewhere between 28 and 36 hours, or well over a DAY.  So I lost all three of my posts.<p>Of course, even though YC/HN knew I was in the middle of posts (""You're submitting too fast.  Please slow down.  Thanks.""), YC/HN did not save the posts.  They destroyed them.  By going BACK I was able to recover them, but only as long as my browser (or machine) did not bork and require restarting.<p>So the effect is chilling.  YC/HN goes out of its way to destroy posts.  The bullies (I assume) abuse their privileges, but YC/HN enables the nasty behavior and pernicious results (heavily delayed or destroyed posts; incomplete and imbalanced conversations).  The posts would be useless now 1. because the thread is old, and 2. because the conversation is too twisted and controlled by the bullies.<p>So YC/HN promotes more than censorship, banning, and destruction of posts.  They promote a culture of bullying and twisted information (at least on bully topics).<p>And I don't see any levers on my account to undo the damage or counter the bullying (modulo candid post like this one).  So, the YC/HN policy promotes ignorance (obstinate attackers), bullying (nasty attackers), and disinformation (the ignorant feed off imbalanced information).<p>Is that YC/HN intention?  No idea, but the site is broken.  That I DO know.<p>So here's what makes the situation even worse: I am largely _guessing_ about what happened, because I really don't know why I was kicked off for over a day.  In other words, the effects are not causal related or explained.  You have to reverse engineer the mystery man (YC/HN) behind the bullying.  And, I assume, the perps of the attack succeed by cutting you out of the conversation --- anonymously.  Well, presumably, except for the one dude I replied to who, I believe, instigated the attacks.<p>Finally (for this post anyway), two more things.<p>1.  I didn't just get cut off from posting as the ""You're submitting too fast."" message suggested.  I do not know how complicated YC/HN disruption algorithm is or what it pertains to (or even if it was just some personal attack by a power-user), but whatever the case, YC/HN kicked me off from even READING <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com</a>.  AT ALL.<p>MY INTERNET ADDRESS was completely cut-off.  No matter if logged out from YC/HN.  No matter if in different browser.  No matter if on different computer.  NO MATTER WHAT.  YC/HN kicked me off even just reading from anywhere, any who, any computer at my internet address.  Yikes!<p>So:  READING is VERBOTEN.  Your IP Address is VERBOTEN.<p>Thank you, Gestapo YC/HN! What a nasty, heavy-handed, inexplicable, ridiculous tactic.<p>Just Insane.<p>So not only are the YC/HN site attack measures largely modal (dangerously and inscrutably hidden in cause-and-effect), but the effects are absurdly broad and heavy-handed.  With a system like this, it's no wonder bullies lurk here.<p>2.  The most humorous thing about this whole experience is that I'm a newbie on the site (or, perhaps, _was_; now I'm a veteran victim and quite ""experienced""!-), was just coming up to speed (thanks to your post) when I got ambushed again, kicked off, and... (wait for it :-) when I returned after doing NOTHING AT ALL for 36 HOURS, my YC/HN ""karma"" went DOWN from -2 to -19 (or thereabouts;  it's -19 now at moment of this post).  My reaction:  it's a badge of honor to have negative karma on YC/HN.<p>Repeat:  YC/HN karma went from -2 to -19 without me doing anything... while kicked out of posting... while kicked off of reading... while my entire IP Address (all browsers, all computers) were prevented from even accessing the site (blank content returned).<p>Absurd.<p>In other words, the system and the bullies are so ridiculous here, that it's a TOTAL JOKE.<p>So I'm not expecting great things from YC/HN.  After recently putting it on my daily URL's, I have now taken it off (no surprise).  BULLY EFFECT successful.  But I will check back when bored, to see what the YC/HN bully system is doing to my account.  If it floats up, so be it.  Maybe the system will ""apologize.""  If it goes down, then I just take it as ludicrous, misguided gamification  bully system at its best.<p>-=-<p>kaolinite (and a few other friendly posters), thank you for the heads up on the YC/HN situation.  Your comments were prescient to what happened to my account.  And they were both a breath of fresh air and very enlightening in an otherwise nasty, brutish situation.<p>Cheers.

Trust.<p>I suspect it might have the added benefit of putting some of the partisans in the same room and making them work together.  It's hard to vilify someone to their face, and/or when you are working with them for the entire day.<p>As for the convenience factor.  If we are truly to govern ourselves, surely that endeavor merits a bit of time and effort.  To borrow an aphorism, ""Penny wise, pound foolish"".<p>We should be sure to make time for people to engage in the process, and to ensure to their satisfaction that it is fair.",1331406032

Here's hoping they buck the trend and establish a framework to encourage rather than inhibit innovation.",1331406024

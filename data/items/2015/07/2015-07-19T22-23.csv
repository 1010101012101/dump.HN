But you&#x27;re not going to get pulled over and cited for sexing without a license, because it tends to happen in private. So how should an insurance company verify that someone <i>isn&#x27;t</i> having sex that could result in an immediate need for prenatal care? What happens when you&#x27;re allowed to opt out, but your contraceptive fails and you have a kid anyway? The risk of ectopic pregnancies and/or miscarriages is high pretty early on, and many of those present in the ER where it&#x27;s ludicrously expensive to even breathe the air.<p>How about diabetes or mental health care, should you be allowed to opt out of that coverage it you&#x27;re sure™ it&#x27;s not going to happen to you? Can women opt out of most everything to do with the prostate?<p>On top of all of this, as another commenter explained, the marginal cost of prenatal/pregnancy/postnatal coverage isn&#x27;t even all that high.

9913139,comment,9912842,9913004,0,0,CHY872,,,"Whoa, this is a worrisome attitude.<p>1. The bugs that MongoDB historically suffers from are those that are unlikely to occur for most people, but when they do cause the most suffering. This is a combination of them being incredibly hard to replicate, but more insidiously that the system keeps working, it just has a small data corruption. This can obviously lead to huge problems down the line. The conclusion is firstly that just because you haven&#x27;t <i>seen</i> a problem doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t one, but also just because there isn&#x27;t a big problem for you doesn&#x27;t mean there won&#x27;t be one in the future.<p>2. Databases have some of the most demanding testing around, due to the important requirements placed on them. There&#x27;s a really good talk floating around from a guy at FoundationDB. The sorts of bugs that keep cropping up in MongoDB are the sorts of bugs that level of testing would find, which is a very bad smell. Thus, one should only resort to MongoDB if no other solution is reasonable.<p>But in reality, for most tasks something like Postgres (with JSON additions) or CouchDB etc is equally suitable and easy to use. This means that most new users of MongoDB can actually afford to use a better/less buggy database, they just choose not to.<p>3. Flat files are generally a silly idea mostly because of the additional tooling that databases give you. ORM systems make using a database much, much easier than using flat files, and the databases usually allow easy analytics. They also typically give better error messages, better performance, better extensibility etc. If it comes time to move your data into the cloud, you&#x27;ll have a much easier time of it if you use a database etc. It&#x27;s a win-win in almost every case.",1437345872

In the next 30 years, the US will face the same problems as cities are today.&quot;<p>The term &quot;US&quot; here means &quot;United States i.e. the federal government&quot; not &quot;United States as a whole country,&quot; since in the second sentence it is comparing the federal government&#x27;s problems to those of cities.<p>And the reason I think OP overstates the severity of the problem is because state finances aren&#x27;t your problem if you don&#x27;t live in that state, while federal finances are everyone&#x27;s problem. Essentially, what OP is saying is: &quot;even if you don&#x27;t live in Illinois or California, you&#x27;ll be facing the same problems in 30 years because the federal government has problems that are just as bad.&quot; But the federal government&#x27;s problems are a lot less bad.

David here, our non-profit PPF created Contact-Congress project on OpenCongress in 2010 and launched the first version publicly in 2011 to automate delivery of digital messages to Congressional webforms. Really excited to see the evolution of the Contact-Congress toolset, now with the launch of Sina & EFF&#x27;s & team&#x27;s Democracy.io.<p>Our primary goal was a positive user experience for OpenCongress visitors, who mostly arrived via search for official information about bills in the news or legislative issues they cared about - to walk these interested bystanders up the ladder of engagement, enabling them to write an informed letter (using info aggregated uniquely by OpenCongress) directly on the page where they learned about a bill in context (both its official status and social comments / plain-language summaries).<p>A secondary goal of Contact-Congress was to give users an immediately-shareable permalink to their letter to their members of Congress (if set to public, as opposed to private) - to demonstrate the potential of Congress treating constituent communications in an open CRM, a public queue, with tools to enable constituents in-district to share helpful resources, timely updates, and organize around their initiatives. My PPF Blog post on this potential for in-district organizing, from May 2014: <a href=""http://goo.gl/gCS0fy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/gCS0fy</a><p>A tertiary goal of Contact-Congress was to demonstrate public demand for open letters and open priority lists for their Congressional offices, and highlight the potential of open data standards for more constituent communications. This is what I&#x27;ve described as the greatest #opengov potential in my nine years in this field (<a href=""http://goo.gl/crVivS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/crVivS</a>) - better listening tools, as per @cjoh&#x27;s priority request - I wrote: &quot;Government staff have new access to dynamic, data-rich dashboards for opinions and feelings of their constituents – crucially, that integrate with their official CRM & CMS solutions, so a bigger-picture is generated, gathering more public feedback & specific expertise.&quot; Exactly such an open data standard already exists and has been successfully tested, a few years ago, with a U.S. Senate office. So what&#x27;s holding back development and adoption of such a standard for delivery & verification of more communications, such as petitions, questions, volunteer offers, public testimony, community events? In my view, it&#x27;s simply a lack of charitable funding support for open-data infrastructure for engaging with government offices - I believe this can implement more & better constituent messages to Congress, including geolocation features for constituent verification in cases where implemented, and better analytics tools for Cong. offices to respond to messages without being buried in a queue.<p>That’s a huge opportunity for non-profits and for-profit civic startups to provide the next generation of CRMs to government – investing in the infrastructure to make that possible now, by supporting the work of PPF and other non-profits, will help open up that data as widely as possible and ensure the participation tools developed on top of it are, at least in part, open-source for remixing.

I&#x27;ve been involved in a proto co-op and know about two others.<p>All I can say is these organizations are still defined by human dynamics. The one I was involved in was supposed to be a straightforward co-op yet ended up struggling with its legal definition for two years, which is going to be very common if many people are involved. It was started by a person with a big ego, who managed all the outside world connections, who, despite pretending to be all about co-ops, through some pretty crude behaviour (substantiated by the fact he embarrassed himself in encounters with other members of the larger community) ended up running everything. Networks, especially in rarefied fields, don&#x27;t choose the most considerate executives. It&#x27;s now a simple corporation to the outside world, which claims to be a co-op through some internal voting system. I can imagine what that looks like (I do know none of the remaining people were able to stand up for much).<p>I was with the project early on and proposed and developed an idea that received $1.1M in funding, its biggest project by far. In the end I walked away and ended up with nothing significant because the pay was lower than average due to some ideas that it was doing virtuous work. In reality it basically supported the person with the big ego who was manipulating things. I have a window into the organization now and am happy I moved past it.<p>Another big co-op in Montreal collapsed, after being widely used for years by the non profit community. The people I talk about it with have very bitter feelings.<p>Another co-op I know of is more focused on farming out work in an open way, but every time I deal with them it&#x27;s the same person so I&#x27;m not sure what their future is like.<p>There are different advantages for different structures, but co-op is difficult. I think everyone involved should stand to benefit in lasting ways and develop their strengths in reasonable ways, not be beholden to a structure that&#x27;s easily manipulated. So tying up resources in an common entity is probably not be the best way. Open source and reputation systems offer interesting ways past this conundrum.

   decades. The only real innovators in this area have been 
   Google and GluGlug. Google ships partially free  
   firmware, although insufficiently libre to be able to 
   provide the “respect your privacy” guarantee. GluGlug 
   can make this claim, and it ships laptops with fully 
   libre firmware. The downside of GluGlug is that it’s an  
   aftermarket add-on. GluGlug and Google have been in 
   business far longer than Purism. So, what has Purism    
   brought in that’s new and exciting and libre? Nothing.
</code></pre>
The content of the post is disputed in the comments by someone who claims to be a &quot;volunteer of Purism project&quot;:<p><pre><code>   Purism is actively working on porting coreboot to Librem15 with 
   some coreboot developer(s). @mrnuke is more than welcome to join 
   the effort :) There, that&#x27;s the truth about Purism.</code></pre>",1437343230

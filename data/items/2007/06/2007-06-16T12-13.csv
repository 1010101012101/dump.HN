That's definitely fairly remote from ""mainstream"" economics these days, although there is a lot of sense to the proposition that the works of the classical economists are more practically useful than the abstract modeling you'd learn as an economics major. If you nonetheless want, for whatever reason, to learn something akin to the modern standard microeconomics curriculum, albeit with a good deal more game theory thrown in, I can recommend the free (Creative Commons!) textbook by Preston McAfee at <a href=""http://www.introecon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.introecon.com</a>",1181995990

The part of the learning process that works so wonderfully in the world of computers is that you can:<p>1. Read something<p>2. Try it out.<p>3. Ask questions of others about the results, then go read more, try it again, and so on.<p>Not quite so easy for economics, business and marketing.",1181995617

7938457,comment,7935872,7938102,3,0,araes,,,"Ha, no issue with the red herring of accountant pay rates, just with the number of them there are.  The ones I have real issues with pay for are the mucky mucks near the top [1], the increasing numbers of them there are [2], and the effect they have on tuition costs [3].<p>On reform, I&#x27;d say something similar to the IRS approach on taxes.  Spend effort where there&#x27;s a return on investment.  IE, they&#x27;re not going to audit people below the poverty line because they&#x27;re sane, and the cost of the audit will be more than the return on back taxes.  Similarly, don&#x27;t audit $20 lunches, because five minutes of my time is worth more than the average we&#x27;ll discover in errors.<p>In addition, an overall lower audit rate, but with randomized chance of audit that increases logarithmically as the charge goes up.  Kind of similar to how the FAA checks pilot logs.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.post-gazette.com/image/2014/05/18/20140519college-presidents-pay850"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.post-gazette.com/image/2014/05/18/20140519college...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/septemberoctober_2011/features/administrators_ate_my_tuition031641.php?page=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/septemberoctober_2...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://watchdog.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/11/rising-cost-of-higher-ed.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://watchdog.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir...</a>",1403625571

I can prove that just by saying that myself, my co-workers, and my family (all Americans) are perfectly fine with taking time-off and we&#x27;re not scared of losing our jobs. My manager encourages his team to take time-off.<p>There is a safety net, it&#x27;s just not as protective as European welfare.<p>There are jobs that like salt mines, filled with workaholics and sadistic bosses, or so I&#x27;m given to understand, but I&#x27;ve never been in one. The worst company I&#x27;ve worked for that had very little regard for their employees gave good vacation time.<p>I think a mistake we make when thinking about American policy is thinking there&#x27;s an American policy. Each state has their own laws and every company is allowed to be different. This has its good parts and its bad parts. Startups seem to thrive in America but I&#x27;ve heard other people complain about the restrictive laws in their countries that make startups harder. Likewise, the American worker seems to work harder and longer than their developed peers.",1403625564

Each country in Europe has their own privacy laws when it comes to query these kind of databases.

There is no such thing as Expedia or privately maintained credit scoring system outside the UK. In France, the Bank of France maintains files which are only available to financial institutions holding a licence.<p>Another example, in the UK, the sex offenders register is only available through the police, in other countries, there have been citizen initiatives to create such database for specific areas.<p>This kind of service is more realistic in the US as their SSN is the main ID for background check.",1403625530

Sure, a lot of it is psychological. But if you&#x27;ve never worked for a boss or company who explicitly discourage vacation, legitimate sick days, etc., then at least know that those people and those companies exist.

But the fundamentals in Greece were not first world at all.

Perhaps most counterintuitively, in an experiment where an arbitrary limit was set on the purchase of soup on sale, the amount of soup people bought was twice what was bought when no arbitrary limit was set. I&#x27;m not aware of any empirical studies examining this with vacation days, but anecdotal evidence like this seems to support the influence of this effect.

7938326,comment,7932642,7936345,2,0,lobster_johnson,,,"Sure. I have been thinking about writing up a blog post about our work since it may be of use to others. A quick summary of some of our current microservices:<p>- Single sign-on. We have a service that abstracts users into identities that map to one or more actual logins. It facilitates the OAuth interaction with providers. To add login in any app, you just redirect the browser to the microservice&#x27;s /auth/:provider API; it redirects through FB or whatever.<p>- For sites that don&#x27;t want to rely on providers like FB, we also have a simple OAuth provider that has a basic user database with salted passwords, email/password management, etc.<p>- Data store. We have a structured, hierarchical document-oriented data store that is a thin layer on top of PostgreSQL. Most apps don&#x27;t have their own database, but use this data store.<p>- Security. We have a common, path-based security model across apps that can be validated through calls into a central security microservice; it&#x27;s mostly a registry of what apps delegate responsibility, and when you ask the security service about whether, say, you&#x27;re allowed to modify the object at path acmecorp.blogapp.posts.1, it asks every app that is registered to be the authority for that path. For example, acmecorp.blogapp might use a role-based security system, but a different path exampleinc.cmsapp might use LDAP.<p>- Voting. For Reddit-style voting and kudos we have a small microservice.<p>- Search. We wrap our data store in an indexing system that uses ElasticSearch.<p>- Organizational management. We have a microservice that handles members, groups and their roles. It plugs into the security system so that we can delegate access to very precise parts of the system. For example, any user can see comments, only the author can edit a comment, and editors can update anything.<p>- Email/texting. We have a microservice that abstracts text and email, currently supporting things like Mailgun and Twilio. It allows us to swap out the implementation without the app knowing.<p>- GIS/map stuff. We have a separate microservices for geocoding and storing GIS features.<p>- Image/audio/video processing. We have a wrapper around ffmpeg and other tools that processes transcoding requests.<p>An important piece of the system is the extensive use of pub/sub via RabbitMQ exchanges to asynchronously publish and listen to events. For example, any microservice can listen to changes to any part of the data store (based on path or event). For example, our search microservice automatically populates ElasticSearch with content from the data store.<p>Lastly, every app has a microservice as its own backend; for example, if the app is a blog system, we have a frontend (eg., a Node.js desktop/mobile web UI), and a separate backend tailored to that frontend; the frontend treats the backend like any other microservice.",1403624309

Your splice would not behave well in these cases but that&#x27;s ok because you can just document that. Additionally, since you pretty much never need the return value of splice, you can just not return anything instead of allocating a wasted array every time (you could also make this controllable from a parameter if needed).</i><p><i>Already with the above, you could probably reach the perf of &quot;native splice&quot; without even considering the fact that user code is actually optimized and compiled into native code. And when you consider that, you are way past any &quot;native&quot; except when it comes to special snowflakes like charCodeAt, the math functions and such.</i><p><i>Thirdly, built-ins are not magic that avoid doing any work, they are normal code implemented by humans. This is biggest reason for the perf difference specifically in the promise case - bluebird is extremely carefully optimized and tuned to V8 optimizing compiler expectations whereas the V8 promise implementation[2] is looking like it&#x27;s directly translated from the spec pseudo-code, as in there is no optimization effort at all.</i><p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/6697#issuecomment-42771111"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/6697#issuecomme...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/master/src/promise.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/master/src/promise.js</a>",1403623178

For the sake of argument, let&#x27;s try rainfall in the Sonora Desert.  What we could do is to burrow an underground canal from the Gulf of California into Laguna Salada, and from there to the Salton Sink.  This would establish shallow, inland, saltwater seas upwind of the desert, in a very sunny area, as a source of atmospheric humidity.  Evaporation would be further encouraged with sea salt manufacturing beds and Salicornia bigelovii plantations.<p>(It would also displace thousands of people whose homes would now be underwater, but let&#x27;s handwave that aside for now.)<p>We then erect solar-powered ionization towers downwind of the new seas, to stimulate cloud formation via charged particles of dust.  Those clouds will tend to blow east over the desert and rain out.  To extend the rainfall further east, we simply plant dry-tolerant plants--such as sorghum, lucern, and field pea--in the newly wet areas, to recycle moisture back into the air via transpiration.<p>Results of the experiment will compare weather patterns in Yuma and Mexicali before and after the megaproject.<p>And then, after spending (optimistically) $20 billion on the subterranean saltwater tunnels, and $100 million on the cloud seeders, we can collect our $10000.  Yay!<p>In comparison to what it would cost to test experimentally a hypothesis that states the entirety of global human economic activity is influencing weather patterns, you will have to spend an amount capable of simulating a portion of the global human economy towards a directed experimental purpose.  $10000 isn&#x27;t even a round-off error.<p>You would be better off buying up unproductive arid land and leasing it to cattle ranchers as semi-arid grazing land afterward.",1403622718

It is a measure of raw, unadjusted economic throughput (cash flow, essentially), not necessarily a measure of economic performance. It is increased by an inefficient healthcare system (healthcare spending makes up 17.7% of the US GDP all on its own, while most of the affluent European countries are in the 9%-11% range), by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and by the United States&#x27; comparatively high energy usage per capita. See also RFK&#x27;s famous quote one the GNP [1].<p>The reason why GDP is still used prominently as an economic indicator, while economists have been looking for better metrics, all those other metrics involve a fair amount of subjectivity. And GDP is still a pretty decent predictor of economic performance, despite its known weaknesses.<p>But in the end, higher GDP does not necessarily translate into higher quality of life (of course, once the gap is large enough, it almost certainly does, at least for the average person, but we aren&#x27;t talking orders of magnitude here). I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll see overall higher QoL in the US compared to Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, or France (the four OECD countries with the fewest hours worked per capita), regardless of where the GDP per capita is.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77IdKFqXbUY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77IdKFqXbUY</a>",1403622338

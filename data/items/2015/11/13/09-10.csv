It is interesting to see the other platforms attempting to model themselves after this (such as the Windows application store or whatever it is called), although you obviously have the power to install and run whatever you want there.<p>I truly hope that OSX does not become the crippled/locked-down OS that iOS is. I know the new rootless feature is a warning sign, as is only allowing signed applications to run.<p>The hard part for us as developers is that we have to eat and pay bills, so all fleeing to Linux to write desktop software there won&#x27;t pay our bills.

The unifying factor among them is that they are not kids anymore, and have wives and families. Yet I still keep hearing about the supposed &quot;talent shortage.&quot;<p>One guy is in his mid-40s, and was a UNIX sysadmin whose company went bankrupt in the dotcom bomb. He&#x27;s survived several recessions. He&#x27;s quite proficient at Python scripting, and he&#x27;s learning JS and Ruby. But companies won&#x27;t hire him, I guess because of &quot;culture fit&quot; which seems to be a code phrase for &quot;we want our team to gel around interests and work styles common among single millennials.&quot; The worst-case scenario is when a company thinks &quot;culture fit&quot; means &quot;we only hire hipsters proficient in Amazeballs framework and BeardyScript.&quot;<p>Some other problems I&#x27;ve observed: finding mentorship is tough, particularly for women and minorities, because the very people in a position to be great mentors are the same people running startups, and don&#x27;t have time to mentor. It&#x27;s a Catch-22.<p>If there really were a tech shortage, you&#x27;d see salaries rising and more training and mentorship instead of the collusion among major companies regarding salary caps and non-poaching agreements. A lot of US-based companies are afraid to train qualified people, like some firms do successfully in the UK (training humanities students from Oxford or Cambridge in software engineering), because they think other companies will poach their talent and therefore their training budget will be spent on their competitors.

You have to invite someone inside to see it.<p>Private social networks take the roll of a pseudo-public space, much like a shopping mall. It may LOOK like a public square, but they can kick you out for any reason. They can decide who is allowed to operate a business and they can decide what is or isn&#x27;t allowed to be said.<p>The erosion of our public spaces started long before Facebook but private social media hubs seem to be accelerating the pace.<p>This isn&#x27;t about being better or worse off based on some arbitrary assessment, it&#x27;s about recognizing the there are fundamental changes happening to society. If we&#x27;re to expect things to continue to be peaceful and orderly we&#x27;re going to have to make sure the ship stays the course.<p>Disruption as a philosophy is brash and arrogant and it makes sense that we&#x27;re having issues with the transfer of institutional knowledge from the previous generation. We&#x27;re still training lawyers and statesmen, but as far as Silicon Valley is concerned, they&#x27;re destined to be replaced by software. Who is making this software and why the should anyone trust them to have any clue as to how to maintain society?<p>I think it is quite possible for us to update the fundamentals of our public infrastructure to the digital age, but it can&#x27;t happen solely based on the self-interested profit motivations of private companies. It needs public oversight. How individuals communicate with one another is clearly a matter of public interest and one that any conservative or liberal should hold as fundamental a roll of government as enforcing private property and the right to a fair trail.<p>Anything outside of this scope of our existing law and order is revolutionary. But who are the revolutionaries and what do the rest of us stand to gain?<p>A lot of Silicon Valley&#x27;s actions are basic and blatant disregards for the law, be it intellectual property with a website like YouTube or zoning and housing violations with AirBnB. Facebook fancies itself one day having a private system of revenue sharing for publishers, instead of our previous public system of copyright that gave constitutional charge for congress to regulate.<p>All of this is sold as innovation, yet it just seems like a short-circuit fueled by consumerism, with a hell of a lot of external costs being loaded on to public infrastructure.<p>We as a people give a charter to Facebook to operate as a company. It&#x27;s not the other way around. Facebook is lucky that we have given them the privilege of a corporate charter. Facebook is lucky that it exists on top of a publicly mandated network neutrality.<p>The general feeling in Silicon Valley is that tech companies are entitled to this public infrastructure yet not at all responsible to public oversight.<p>Public oversight is spoken of like a communicable disease in this industry yet public oversight is what makes our marketplaces function and keep our legal systems working.<p>What if you could only start a corporation as a favor from a senator? What if we didn&#x27;t have court-appointed lawyers? What if we copyright or trademark weren&#x27;t equally granted nor equally enforced? What if there were no limits on private monopoly?<p>What if there were no public forums for debate?",1447407600

Once you have a livable basic income, you don&#x27;t really need a minimum wage and progressive taxation anymore. Those things exist primarily to guarantee livable conditions for the very poorest, but Basic Income would guarantee those livable conditions in a far more simple and effective way.<p>Two important effects of this would be:<p>a) the labour market would become a lot more open and free. At the moment, employers wield all the power because employees <i>need</i> a job. It&#x27;s not a free market if you can&#x27;t say no to a deal. With basic income, people can say no if the offer is too bad. But if your alternative is starvation, a terrible job for too little pay is still better than nothing. Minimum wage exists to limit the employers&#x27; power to exploit people who have no option to say no.<p>b) It fixes the unemployment trap. For people with unemployment or disability benefits, getting a low-pay part-time job often means they end up with less money (or the same money and more costs) despite them taking the effort to work, because they lose the benefits. This discourages people from working. With Basic Income, you keep that income if you get a job, so you always get ahead by working, even if it&#x27;s only a little. There&#x27;s nothing fraudulent anymore about doing little jobs while unemployed.<p>I&#x27;d probably prefer both the basic income and the tax to be a bit higher than Friedman would like them to be, but that&#x27;s part of the standard political-economic give and take. As long as the Basic Income is at least enough for decent food and rent, I&#x27;m happy.",1447407030

I consider one year before and after the 7th year to account for people who go up for tenure early or late because of a leave of absence, for example. I put universities into bins of 3 based on their ranking and assume that an individual is denied tenure if that person moves to a lower-ranked university group after 6-8 years. For example, a person who moves from Harvard to MIT after 6 years is not assumed to have been denied tenure since he moves within the same bin of schools. Someone who moves from Harvard to UCLA after 6 years is assumed to have been denied tenure since he moves to a lower group of schools. As another example, a person who moves 5 or fewer years after his initial appointment is not assumed to have been denied tenure since he moved before the tenure window (years 6 through 8 at an institution) starts.&quot;<p>Arbitrary binning of universities, using a change in employer as a proxy for getting tenure, using number of papers published as a measure of productivity, fitting lines to a relationship that does not appear linear (and in fact cannot be linear since fraction getting tenure must be in the range 0-1).<p>This issue may exist, but I don&#x27;t think this analysis is capable of producing anything convincing.",1447406204

People on a small, narrow, windy street with pedestrians around will drive another speed. The point is that people make these judgment calls primarily based on instinct, rather than based on signs.<p>Imagine that you were walking down a path on foot, and one sign said the walking path was supposed to be 1 mph, and another said 2 mph, and another said 3 mph.

These people create traffic problems since they move at a different speed than the rest of traffic. I read a good article about how traffic planners are re-evaluating the idea that slow speed limits are a good thing or beneficial for safety. The conclusion was that slower speed limits do not actually benefit safety; if the posted speed limit is out of alignment with the road, and whether people feel safe, it creates more problems than it helps. The takeaway from the research was that if traffic planners want people to drive more slowly, then they need to create smaller, narrower roads.",1447405480

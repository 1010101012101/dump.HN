It puts me in a frame of mind that helps me make better decisions: will working myself to death on feature X help me 10 years from now? (Very rarely, the answer is yes.) Does it make sense to spend more time socializing, studying, or working? I don't want to exercise <i>now</i>, but how will going to the gym affect me in 5 years?<p>The funny thing is that I make better decisions even with extremely short term projects. If I'm working on a 1-month software project, I'll get it done better <i>and faster</i> if I have the perspective that I'll be using it for 10 years than if I have the perspective that I'll be using it for 6 months.<p>So it may be worth putting yourself in a long-term state of mind, even when it's not necessarily true.",1357757968

The (socialist) FDA already stops you from buying food with lead in it. The (socialist) DMV forces you to wear a seat-belt and wear a motorbike helmet and the (socialist) Police stop you beating people up on the street whenever you want.<p>You are basically saying you don't want ""big government"" to tell you want you can't do, even though those rules and limitations would make your society better for everyone overall. Everyone's happiness would go up. This is very selfish and shortsighted.<p>3) It's very simple. Everyone is equal. A billionaire is treated the same as a homeless person.

5032762,comment,5032451,5032597,9,0,anigbrowl,,,"1. Oh please, this is just a truism expressing your general political views. Government does lots of things well. Every time there's a relevant accident, the NTSB is on the spot within 24 hours. The FAA does an amazing job. I could go on with many other examples; and where government is slow to respond, it's often because the rules <i>require</i> government to engage in a lengthy public consultation process or make it easy for third parties to litigate against the government (see: any case involving environmental review). It's not like waste, inefficiency, and so on are absent from the private sector.<p>2. The more your choices impact the lives of others (making yourself chronically ill and sucking up expensive medical resources, driving at 100mph in the rain), the more costs your bad choices impose on other people. Government is the agency we delegate some of our individual autonomy to in order to deal with such systemic problems. The alternative is everyone suing everyone else all the time.<p>3. I'll tell you the downsides: there are waiting lists for some procedures that are in high demand. There are about as many industrial disputes as before. Everybody blames the government for everything (like a tiny country hospital shutting down, nurses' pay, availability of some experimental treatment of unknown efficacy). A commonly-voiced fear is that if healthcare is cheap then everyone will crowd up doctor's waiting rooms all the time. This doesn't happen, because other than a tiny number of hypochondriacs nobody likes going to the doctor unnecessarily, for the same reason that most people don't engage in recreational dentistry.<p>The fact is that healthcare can't clear like a normal market for three reasons: a) there are genetic factors that you have no ability to control or predict that can make you sick unexpectedly; b) you typically don't have a choice about when you get sick so you can't defer your healthcare spending accordingly; c) most participants in the market are  woefully under-informed because they don't have any kind of medical degree, and price theory demands market transparency for all participants in order for equilibrium to emerge and vendors to be price takers. What we have instead is a monstrously inefficient and unresponsive form of monopolistic competition, in which part of your healthcare costs go towards billboards and TV commercials for goods and services whose efficacy you are incapable of judging properly, massive layers of incomprehensible administration, and heads-I-win-tails-you-lose pricing that royally shafts the individual consumer in insurance and care markets.",1357757690

5032755,comment,5027560,5030018,3,0,aphyr,,,"Riemann is a giant ball of mutable state and IO, and makes extensive use of the STM: <a href=""https://github.com/aphyr/riemann/blob/master/src/riemann/streams.clj"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/aphyr/riemann/blob/master/src/riemann/str...</a><p>The critical thing, as you observed, is to separate IO from retryable STM transactions with a barrier; e.g. by receiving data, doing an idempotent computation <i>inside</i> dosync or swap!, and then emitting results. Haskell has an advantage in that this separation is provable by the type system, whereas in Clojure you need to remember.<p>A contrived example:<p><pre><code>  (let [pizza (get-from-fridge)
        meal  (dosync
                (alter eaten-foods conj pizza)
                (deref eaten-foods))]
    (tell-friend ""So far I ate"" meal))
</code></pre>
where get-from-fridge and tell-friend are IO operations, and our list of eaten foods is mutated by pure functions.<p>In practice I don't find this particularly limiting: dosync and swap! are almost always short operations for performance reasons anyway. Then you return a consistent snapshot of the updated state from dosync--where multiple pieces of state are involved, you can use vectors or maps along with destructuring bind. Sometimes it's a tad unwieldy, but typically much shorter than the equivalent mutex dance.<p>There are other aspects of Clojure's concurrency libraries, like agents, futures, and promises, which are useful in IO. Specifically, agents give you asynchronous serializability, futures give you asynchronous concurrency, and promises allow for synchronous handoff of delayed values. Those are quite useful when working with IO, though for heavy lifting you may be better off using explicit queues and worker pools from java.util.concurrent.<p>Sometimes I think of Clojure (as an imperative language) as the dual of Haskell's lazy evaluation model. Clojure uses futures, promises, and lazy sequences to provide explicit laziness, where Haskell uses the IO monad to provide explicit ordering. Both have an STM for serializable, atomic mutability between threads.",1357757635

This includes crawlers, drive-by users, everybody. The standard way arc encourages webapps to be programmed (<a href=""http://paulgraham.com/arcchallenge.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/arcchallenge.html</a>) is by leaking memory. Every load of the front-page creates 30 closures just for the 'flag' links. Ignoring IPs is just a band-aid to cover up this huge sink[1].<p>I've been programming in arc for 3 years and am still active on the arc forum. I love that arc is a small and simple language without lots of bells and whistles[2]. I really couldn't care less that it's 'not taken off'. But there's a different between toys that encourage exploratory play, and painting yourself into a corner design-wise. I now think of continuation-based webservers as an evolutionary dead end.<p>[1] Another ill-effect of the ip-ignoring is that every newcomer to arc who tries to run it behind a proxy server immediately runs into a gotcha: The arc webserver now thinks all requests are coming from the same IP address and so throttles everybody. <a href=""http://www.arclanguage.org/item?id=11199"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arclanguage.org/item?id=11199</a><p>[2] If you spend any time with it it literally begs to be tinkered with.

A public system is one option (and one that I'm in favor of), but there could be other solutions too.<p>In general, the current system doesn't stop people who can't pay from receiving care. If we agree that allowing someone to die because they can't pay isn't acceptable then we need to have some kind of public system. Care is rationed by insurers and providers who make judgement calls that, largely, aren't subject to public scrutiny or regulation. (We have the ""death panels"" that those opposed to public healthcare railed against, but these ""panels"" are made up of insurers and providers working in a decentralizd, uncoordianted, and uncontrolled manner.)<p>What we have is a ""shadow socialist"" system where those parties who can afford to pay have to carry the slack for everybody who can't. Individuals and employers end up paying higher premiums to insurers. Healthcare providers increase the cost of procedures to cover the write-offs for the uninsured. Insurers negotiate relationships that limit consumer choice or access to procedures that providers aren't willing or able to discount.<p>It's like the entire mess is designed to be suboptimal for all parties involved. It's depressing that, as a country, we can't have reasonable discourse, agree to compromise, and come up with some kind of substantive strategy.",1357757512

It's good, but it could be better.<p>I moved to Canada from Australia, so I'll compare the two systems for you.<p>Canada: ""healthcare for all"" provides basic coverage of everything you need. Works pretty well. Even homeless / out of work people are fully covered. Things like dental and chiropractor are not covered, so you pay for those. Employers give ""health care"" which really just means they will pay a percentage of your costs for things like dental, chiropractors, prescriptions, etc.<p>The problem here is that if you want ""better than basic"" healthcare, it's tied to your employer, which has all the negative impacts of the US system of being stuck to your job. This sucks.<p>Australia: Same as Canada in that basic coverage covers emergencies and what-not for everyone. Again dental, chiropractors are not covered. BUT if you want ""better than basic"" care, it's your choice if you want to go out (with your own cash) and buy ""private health care"" which again will pay a percentage of your out-of-pocket costs for those extras (dental, etc.).<p>The massive, massive, massive advantage here is that your health is in not directly linked to your job. Your employer has no say or impact on your choice of healthcare provider, or if you even want to buy that extra coverage. As a single, healthy 30 year old, I've never seen the need to pay the extra, but in Canada I'm forced to because my employer says so.<p>I've been in Canada 7 years, and I actually think I'll go back to Australia, primarily for exactly that reason.<p>EDIT: OK, sure. In Canada you can also choose to buy your own ""extra"" health care from your own money. What I think is bad is how employers do it for you, without you having much say in the matter. In this way, Canadians feel their health is connected to their employer (a great example is when you interview for a job in Canada, people ask ""what are the benefits like""? - In Australia, that is not a question.)",1357757463

It seems like this is simply a money transfer to health care executives.<p>2) The more private companies run our lives (especially something like healthcare), the more they will be able to dictate our choices (what we eat, risky behavior etc).  Oh wait... corporations already do dictate what we eat, what sort of medicine we use, where we work, how we communicate, how we move around, what we wear...The only difference between corporate control and government control is that we actually have some say in how the government controls us <i>because at the end of the day we control the government.</i><p>3) I haven't seen on person that supports privated health care tell me the downside.  I know they exist and we need to know the risks and talk about them openly before we stick with such a horrible system.<p>But anyways, the downsides to public health care:  cafeteria health care (i.e., standardized treatments) which is good for most patients but not for the few who have nonstandard variations of ailments; higher taxes; less personalized care as a consequence of standardized treatments; potentially reduced choice of health care provider(s) (but if the entire system is UHC this may not be the case); potentially longer waits for medical treatment that cannot be handled in a day (i.e., anything that cannot be handled outpatient or by nurses or nurse practitioners).<p>And the downsides to private health care: <i>all of the above, plus:</i> risk of claim denial for valid claims (though admittedly less of a risk now as a consequence of numerous state and federal laws cracking down on claim denials); double-digit increases in premiums every year despite no corresponding increase in costs (<i>this is actually happening, and has been happening, every year for the past decade</i>); reduced choice of health care providers (which is actually the case now, i.e., in-network vs. out-of-network); ruinous medical bills; unnecessary tests and treatments; private health information being shared with ""business partners""; inadequate medical facilities as a result of lack of capital investment due to premiums being redirected to marketing or executive retention.<p>It turns out the downsides of a private health care system outweigh the downsides of a public health care system, since you have all of the same downsides but the additional downsides that come with a profit-seeking business.

Sad truths is that most smaller companies do not even think about having credit cards. There is slowly some change, form what I have experienced, mostly due to older CEOs and business owners being replaced by a younger generation but overall credit cards are not as common here as in America.<p>On the other hand I currently looked at some providers for credit card processoring (currently working on a project where it could become necessary). Most of the services seem to require your company to be in America or England, most won't work in Germany. So maybe I skip credit cards for the beginning and chose to go with something else (just hypothetical) - does this mean I do not have a product? Because I only support 5 out of 6 possible payment options?<p>Then there is still the option of in app purchases. For most apps which are ""just an app"" I believe they will work way better. No need for another service, no separate website or member area, nothing to care about but integrate an existing system which is designed to move money from a customer as fast and easy as possible to you (and a middle man).<p>The author is right that you should think about payment processing while working on a product - but processing credit cards is <i>not</i> the holy grail.",1357757077

It makes no sense that you have to pay for my reckless high-risk behavior such as jumping out of a second floor window ""for shits and giggles"".<p>Another thing in particular that I want to call out attention to is food. If I retarded enough to eat nothing but McDonalds every day for a year, why should you just not let me die? Why should you pay for my surgery? If you are going to pay for it, over time you will gravitate towards a ""high-risk fee"" on activities that are just plain dumb.<p>Let's increase taxes on cigarettes, alcohol, (and implement new ones on ecstacy, marijuana, and all drugs... I don't know how that's possible without legalization but there is no way I am paying for someone rehab for something that has not been taxed)<p>The idea is that nobody should have to pay for someone else's high risk activities. Over time, the high risk activities will become expensive enough. Money will be a driving force that will drive people towards a better lifestyle. Think about it. Money will be a force for good for once.<p>Just take McDonalds. People say McD is a cheaper to healthier food. If a McD meal is a dollar and causes a health maintenance fee of twenty dollars, what do we do? We tack that twenty dollars to the cost of the meal. Bam! The McDonalds meal is now $21. That $2.49 price tag on the celery at Aldi's is suddenly not so expensive by comparison.<p>Yes, there are downsides but if enough people are annoyed you will get real reform.

Who are you? What have you done? You've proven nothing to me on this one page site, which isn't even attractive in itself.

As EC2 does not support live migration, this is not possible.<p>When you use EC2 (or any cloud infrastructure) a lot, you stop thinking within the constraints of physical servers.  The very nature of EC2 is the first letter of its acronym: Elasticity.  You are able to bring up functionally equivalent duplicate servers when the demand arises and terminate them when the demand no longer exists.  This exists not only for HPC applications (our domain), but even horizontally scaling web servers based on demand.<p>EC2 allows you to request different ""instance types"". A given class offers the same cpu speed[1], memory, and disk usage. To make scaling tractable, you need to make the assumption that if your program operates correctly on a single (or even a few), say, m2.4xlarge instance types, it will do so on all of them.<p>Customers do not use us solely because we provide an excellent distributed computing interface. They also use PiCloud, because we (thanks to the capabilities of Amazon EC2) are highly elastic.  This customer doesn't want to continually run several dozen m2.4xlarge equivalent instances, because their utilization doesn't justify doing so.  Instead, PiCloud allows them to run massive computation for a short time and not incur charges when the servers are no longer needed. (Resulting in far lower average costs than having their own on-site cluster.)<p>Think about how this customer would have used EC2 directly within these constraints. Their workload would be something like deploy a few dozen servers, run computation on said servers, and terminate servers when complete.  After getting this application to work correctly, they may conclude they are ""done"".  It might work for months, and then one day, he would find that some ""jobs"" raised Illegal Instructions.  And there would have been no way to anticipate this happening.  And from their perspective, where the ""requesting dozens of servers"" is part of the application, the hardware had changed underneath them.<p>[1] Yes, performance will differ a bit across different instances. However, you expect that functionality is identical across all instances of the same type (e.g. m2.4xlarge).",1357755141

This article seems like a strange mix of a Microsoft marketing piece, and a call for app developer collusion. In other industries it seems almost by definition that the worth of the product is what it's selling for -- .99 cents for most apps. Arguments along the lines of ""surely apps are worth more because, c'mon look at the price of coffee,"" use only emotion based on how much work we see go into those as developers not the value provided to users. It's very easy to blame poor revenue as a marketplace problem rather than a product problem and it's this type of thinking that drives this conclusion rather than proper analysis.<p>A hit driven industry can be brutal but I'm not convinced that the app store is more of one than traditional software, social websites, marketplaces, and games all spring to mind as places where success is very hit driven. Even outside our industry: books, television, movies, music, fashion - these all all hit driven because that is what fits best with where the demand is.<p>* In the television industry most shows have both higher production costs and lower prices than software, does this mean this industry is broken?<p>* Increasingly for app store purchases with higher prices I hear about the apps from avenues other than the Apple featured list (ex drawing apps, higher priced games.) It seems that the marketing channel that is being provided for free is being mistaken for the only way to market.<p>Fundamentally as a developer if I want my app to sell for more money, I should make it bring more value to the customer, not hope for minimum pricing constraints on all apps. It's a great thing as a consumer that distribution and marketing channels like the app store have made it possible for me to use more software, and spend more money on software than I ever did on a pc.<p>[0] See minimum pricing of Xbox live games on both Xbox and Windows Phone",1350593508

However, the price drop would cause those same put's to jump in price by roughly the loss on a share.

These are data-driven cultures. They actually require scientifically valid and methodologically sound data to make a claim.<p>Programming, on the other hand, is dominated by fashion. Language wars, methodology wars, business bullshit, buzzword chasing. Programming is not data-driven AT ALL! When was the last time a computer scientist actually did some SCIENCE? When was the last time a programmer actually ran a double blind study?<p>99% of programming is not data-driven whatsoever. The sweeping decisions in programming are made by corporate big wigs operating on their intuition, or are design choice (extremely subjective!) made by ""architects"" who, for instance, created UNIX.<p>Were the people who created Python, Ruby, Java, C, etc DATA-DRIVEN? What studies did they use to decide that so-and-so feature should be like this and not like this?<p>Programming is mostly a craft and has essentially nothing to do with being data-driven. Doing A-B tests does not mean your culture is data driven when A-B tests are like 0.1% of everything you do. And most A-B tests are methodologically unsound anyway and would be shamed out of any real social science department.<p>Economics, on the other hand, is an actual science with actual data that performs actual methodologically sound studies using advanced statistics. Practicing economists have to use actual valid data procured from real studies to have careers. Programmers mostly twiddle their bits around until something works.

4670941,comment,4670018,4670226,2,0,wycats,,,"<p><pre><code>    2) The avoidance of C-corps has to do with double taxation and
    high-marginal rates on the second level of taxation. So, again,
    this analysis is flawed. The absence of C-corps is evidence that
    the tax rate/s in fact makes them un-economic and thus illogical
    to bring into existence.
</code></pre>
Exactly right. A good tax system would provide limited tax advantages (or maybe even added costs) to filing as a pass-thru entity, allowing companies to use the appropriate tax structure, and help make policy appropriately targeted for businesses vs. individuals.<p>Obama's business tax blueprint explicitly addresses this:<p><pre><code>    (iii) Distorting the form of businesses.

    Business may be organized under a variety of different forms,
    including C-corporations, S-corporations,  partnerships, and
    sole-proprietorships. These organizational forms offer varying
    legal, regulatory, and tax treatments. The primary difference in
    tax treatment between C-corporations, on the one hand, and 
    S-corporations, partnerships, and sole-proprietorships, on the
    other, is applicability of the corporate income  tax. C-corporations
    are subject to the corporate tax, while pass-through entities are
    not.

    The combined effect of this varying tax treatment has contributed
    to a lower effective tax rate for pass-through entities relative to
    C-corporations. The effective marginal tax rate on new investment
    by C-corporations is now 32.3 percent, while the effective marginal
    tax rate on new investment by passthrough businesses 26.4
    percent.

    ...

    The ability of large pass-through entities to take advantage of
    preferential tax treatment has placed businesses organizing as
    C-corporations at a disadvantage. By allowing large pass-through
    entities preferential treatment, the tax code distorts choices of
    organizational form, which can lead to losses in economic efficiency;
    business managers should make choices about organizational form
    based on criteria other than tax treatment.

    ...

    Reduce the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 28 percent.
    This reduction in the rate would put the United States in line with
    other advanced countries, help encourage greater investment in the
    United States, and reduce the tax-related economic distortions
    discussed above.
</code></pre>
As a person who has just spent a bunch of time deciding on my form of business, I consider the S-Corp option to, in fact, be distortive (and costly, from a time and accounting cost perspective). I am glad that this discussion is happening in policy circles, and that Obama explicitly addresses it in his blueprint, even though it is not really part of the public discussion.",1350592561

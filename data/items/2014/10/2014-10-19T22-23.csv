Your programs will be somewhat simpler - and whenever you need to use a variable in several places, you&#x27;ll have to explicitly name it - but still.<p>Incomprehensibility happens in part because all ASCII characters are used - so you have a lot of differently-looking symbols; because [ and { aren&#x27;t paired with ] and }, and &quot; isn&#x27;t paired either; because you often have . and : as the second character of built-in entities, so you&#x27;ve got a lot of dots... APL used the symbols invented explicitly for those purposes, but the price - non-ASCII alphabet - was considered too high.

Appilepsy is a mobile app that detects if you are having a convulsive epileptic seizure through an intelligent algorithm which analyses accelerometer data in real-time in your phone&#x27;s background. Following the detection of a seizure, the app runs a countdown for an adjustable amount of time in which the alarm can be deactivated, in case of a false positive. If the alarm is not deactivated, the app automatically sends your emergency contacts both a text message and a computer-generated voice message utilizing the Nexmo API. The text message contains a link to our web app, which is a responsive site that works on any screen-size. This site displays the location of the phone at the time of the seizure on a map generated by esri&#x27;s arcGIS API, as well as a link to citymapper for directions to that location. While the app sends these messages, it provides real-time updates of whether the emergency contacts have seen the message/received the call. It also provides a map to the nearest medical facilities and instructions for people aiding the person seizing via computer generated voice commands. <a href=""http://appilepsy.phil.bio/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://appilepsy.phil.bio/</a>",1413759100

That spending wasn&#x27;t cut with the tax cuts; or that tax cuts weren&#x27;t paid for out of surplus (which obviously the modern US Govt. has rarely had).<p>For example, had George W. Bush not gone on a massive spending spree, there would have been zero deficit problem during his presidency in relation to the tax cuts. The problem was the extreme spending increases during his eight years, combined with cutting revenue.<p>There&#x27;s no inherent moral basis to claim rich people should always get soaked on taxes, even when there&#x27;s plenty of revenue such that you have a surplus - it&#x27;s a question of balancing.<p>I&#x27;d argue unchecked spending expansion, drastically faster than the rate of population increase (ie what has happened in the last 13x years), is far more destructive than tax cuts for the wealthy. If you run a disciplined budget, and an efficient government, you will more than likely be able to bring down taxes for all people over time. The US has done the exact opposite lately, as have so many other failing welfare states across the globe.",1413759089

8479904,comment,8479247,8479688,0,0,meowface,,,"Actually, there are several ways to detect such attacks. I work in network security and incident response, and I immediately recognized the URLs in the infection chain from Figure 3 and Figure 20 in the whitepaper. They&#x27;re using the Sweet Orange exploit kit, which has been around for a while and is not that hard to detect if you have any appliance screening HTTP requests and responses. Example URL patterns: <a href=""http://malware-traffic-analysis.net/2014/10/06/index2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://malware-traffic-analysis.net/2014/10/06/index2.html</a><p>Also, despite Invincea&#x27;s claims to the contrary, good intelligence feeds and in some cases just proxy domain categorization are often fast enough to catch these for most organizations, at least in cases where the attack isn&#x27;t specifically targeted at a single organization. This is on top of multiple layers of defense that any decent company should have, many of which could catch numerous indicators (domain patterns, URI paths, Javascript) tied to these exploit kits.<p>The bidder has to prop up and supply the exploit kits themselves, and most of the time it&#x27;s Sweet Orange, Nuclear, Rig, or Angler. But these are all &quot;commodity&quot; exploit kits and aren&#x27;t even remotely custom made like they have been in some APT attacks. APTs may also go the ad bidding route and provide their own handcrafted exploit kits, but they may not want to go through a middleman like this and set up a corporate front.<p>The only unnerving part is the ability to choose a specific target subnet. If the ad networks or second-tier middlemen of &quot;spreaders&quot; / &quot;distributors&quot; are promising clients exclusive access to a certain group of servers or even an entire ad network for a length of time, and if the client uses a specifically created new domain and maybe even a fresh IP, then that means no one may know about the compromised server/network until it&#x27;s too late and several people from the targeted organization visit it.<p>I don&#x27;t know for sure since Invincea did not investigate more into the human aspect of this, but I suspect for this to be profitable there&#x27;s probably a lot of &quot;overselling&quot; going on, and the bidders interfacing with the ad networks themselves are serving multiple customers&#x27; campaigns (or their own campaigns) on the same servers and ad networks, which makes it more difficult to successfully pull off targeted drivebys or &quot;watering holes&quot; as they will get detected and evicted.<p>>I&#x27;m sure the talented people at the larger ad-exchange-software companies like AppNexus will figure something out - or they already have!<p>AppNexus has been a major offender here for a long time. They&#x27;ve had numerous incidents of malicious ads over the years. I know because I&#x27;ve seen them myself when investigating malware incidents (e.g. adnxs.com as the Referer in an exploit kit chain). You can also see adnxs.com in Figure 21 of the whitepaper. I certainly hope they start caring more about security and establish a more stringent ad reviewal process.",1413758787

The virtue of relying solely on constant-time operations is that they&#x27;re constant time by design. You don&#x27;t have to worry about how the variable-time operations are implemented, because there aren&#x27;t any.<p>The smaller problem is that you have to make sure that your noise function is not itself a target of attack, which can be a little tricky because your noise function must be extremely, extremely cheap to compute.<p>There&#x27;s also the obvious &quot;non-problem&quot; that reducing a function to it&#x27;s lowest common denominator of performance defeats the purpose of high-speed cryptography and variably-timed implementations in the first place.",1413758749

My job has a huge range of variability. That may be helped by the fact that I rotate I to totally different areas of medicine every few months and will for another year before I start specialising.
Even so, yes it&#x27;s true (or at least I feel it is) that we are a customer service industry (or at least should be).
Sometimes this is the greatest part of my day.
I know, for example, that for a certain percentage of my patients I will be able to make a huge difference to the perception they have of the healthcare system just by sitting and taking 5 minutes to explain in laymans terms what we are doing.<p>In my hospital&#x27;s patient population (mostly white Anglo Saxon Australians, usually slightly older than the national average) this comes across very well because I am a 6 foot 2 100kg white man, so I fit the mould of what they want as a doctor. (Sometimes this results in the patient confiding in me how happy he is that he is talking to a &#x27;real Aussie&#x27; - the racism is astounding and very irritating sometimes)
Women have a harder time and many of my female colleagues are regularly assumed to be nurses even after introducing themselves as doctors.<p>But I digress.
Yes, a lot of my job becomes routine. I have studied for 10 years to be where I am and know huge areas of disease and the pathological basis back and forwards. But that doesn&#x27;t stop many situations from being fascinating.<p>When I started med school I was all about the science - I loved it.
Now I have found that a side benefit is (some) of the people and making a difference.
Sometimes I&#x27;m too busy, and I can see the ability to get jaded; my (medical) friends and I will often (confidentially) describe some of the horrible situations we have seen; and you need to be able to laugh at times as a coping mechanism.<p>But I love my job; for the variability; for the characters; for the 1 in 50 patients that totally changes your world view and makes your life richer for having treated them; for the care that is entrusted to me; and for the really top notch people I am surrounded by, who will accept nothing less than excellence from themselves and give their time freely to improve your education and ability",1413757915
8479869,comment,8477150,8478258,0,0,tizzdogg,,,"No, layering just means generating multiple renders for a given shot, which can then be combined to create the final image using 2d compositing software such as Nuke. Full 3d renders are always going to be much slower than just doing image manipulations in 2d, so it is much more efficient to iterate by making adjustments in 2d than by re-rendering everything from scratch every time you need to make a change. Additionally if just one element in a shot changes, say a character&#x27;s animation changes, it much more efficient to just render the layer for that element again than to re-render ALL the geometry for the entire shot. Each layer may still be rendered with full global illumination and whatever other fancy lighting is needed.. the layering just makes it easier to iterate in individual pieces of a shot.<p>In feature animation things are changing and being adjusted constantly. Each shot is worked on by many people across multiple disciplines, all of whom do many, many iterations to hone in in the final shot. So the entire production pipeline is designed to make handling changes as efficient and easy as possible. Look at the amount of processing resources disney used for this movie.. I can guarantee you they are cutting all the corners they can and maximizing efficiency wherever possible. Doing a single monolithic render every time something changed would be extremely inefficient.<p>That said, there are a few studios that do produce complete final frames in-render. Usually places that write their own renderers in-house and therefore have a sort of macho academic attachment to showing off how much their renderer can achieve out of the box. Blue Sky is this way because their whole pipeline is designed around their cg studio renderer. Anecdotally I have heard that Pixar did everything in renderman for a long time but more recently they have started using more of a compositing workflow since it&#x27;s so much more efficient. So it&#x27;s possible that disney may be this way now since they have this fancy new hyperion renderer they wrote, but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t bet on final frames all being done in-render.",1413757868

Digital design is a skill that <i>really</i> requires deep thought about what a given piece of syntax will compile down to; it&#x27;s possible to skim over the &quot;building blocks&quot; of software (for instance, it is possible to be a very good JavaScript programmer without knowing what the JIT will transform your code to), but in order to build effective (or even possible-to-synthesize!) hardware designs, I believe that it is very important to start with the fundamentals of how hardware actually works.<p>So, I plead: if you have cause to write a digital design book, don&#x27;t write it as a &quot;Verilog for Computer Scientists&quot;!  Verilog is a big language, and not all of it is good for writing hardware.  What you really want is &quot;Digital Design for Computer Scientists&quot;.",1413756647

8479799,comment,8476063,8477470,0,0,BuckRogers,,,"I think there are other factors more important than economic. That is probably one of the worst metrics to base any decision on. If the goal is money, there are many ways to get it without learning a language. Seems like an odd primary concern for language learning. 
That said, keep in mind that Germans and Japanese people have a much easier time learning English due to it&#x27;s ubiquity than the OP would theirs, making his employment less attractive to just hiring a local who knows English. Also, going forward, there&#x27;s a much better chance the spread-out Spanish &#x27;world GDP&#x27; will increase somewhere by a large amount. The German and Japanese speaking world are maxed out on GDP potential today. Likelihood of expansion of either died with WW2.<p>Spanish is an unstoppable train like English has been. It&#x27;s the safe bet on all fronts, and exporting its culture unlike the insular Chinese languages have remained. An American is lucky to have that be a de facto 2nd language to learn. Much of the world is stuck with something far less relevant going forward (other than English). Even French in Canada, hard to choose Spanish over French if Canada.. yet Spanish is by most metrics the better choice. That with French being one of the better choices, most nations neighbor&#x27;s have even less relevant languages as an obvious 2nd language choice.<p>That said, the easy answer is to learn what you have an interest in.

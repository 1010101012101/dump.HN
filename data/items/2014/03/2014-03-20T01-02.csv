A silent hero, fighting everyday against against oppression, law and order. A person whose sole interest is keeping information free and accessible to everyone. Maybe he is not the best guy in socializing and communicating his interests and maybe some hackers are doing pranks and breaking your phone switches. But these are the people who are the front line the only ones who are willing to carry the fight for freedom and equality into the internet and against the people who are now calling themselves &quot;Hackers&quot;. Businessmen, lawyers and founders all those people which interests are to make money and obey. YOU silicon valley guys aren&#x27;t hackers anymore. you have become the mass you have sold your ambitions. I&#x27;m going to shed a tear now for all of you. Hacking is about rebellion hacking is keeping the internet free of scum like fascists and governments Hacking is the way of autonomous thinking.

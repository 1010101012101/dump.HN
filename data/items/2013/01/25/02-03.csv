5113670,comment,5112748,5113477,6,0,ChuckMcM,,,"""Pirating"" is the act of acquiring a copy of a copyrighted work in a way that is contrary to existing law. ""Downloading"" Copyrighted works can be done completely legally, the simplest example being to buy a copy of a movie on itunes and transferring it to your phone or tablet. This is a 'third' way of legally downloading content which is sort of like buying property with a tax lien on it, the government (in this case the WTO) has stepped in, set aside the rights of the property owner, and is sanctioning an action to make whole the person or entity who is wronged.<p>So the WTO sets aside the rights of US Copyright holders and allows Antiqua to sell those works, allowing it to recover damages that the US Government has failed to pay. The government could ""pay"" the $21M fine and the WTO would rescind this, but if they do that then they show that they are wrong in denying access to the US market for Antiqua gambling interests. If they don't pay it, they are bound by membership in the WTO to abide by its decisions. It is a delicious paradox.",1359082111

Already we can see hair transplant robots [1] that take the cosmetic doctors almost entirely out of the picture and I'm sure surgery robots are being developed. I don't see how this kind of industry can create more jobs than it eliminates. However, better education and awareness of chronic illnesses caused by lifestyle I think would help free up hundreds of billions of dollars that would then stay with the consumers (or non-healthcare corporations which might then just hold on to it).<p>If you decrease the cost of capital equipment by automating their production (aka, by making automation easier and cheaper), it will allow many more people to buy them and drive their price down further because of increasing volume. This could then lead to a diaspora of small time manufacturers and service providers who replace large entities, become more local, and drive down the prices of everything through competition. The consequences here would be wild and unpredictable. Maybe the sum generated economic activity would be much greater than the whole (as it often is with manufacturing industries), but we can't say that for sure because of the limited value add that these manufacturers can provide over their equipment (as it currently is with manufacturing...). The other consequence would be the devaluation of the equipment causing a devaluation of the service contracts, which would probably lead to more automation through modularity, machine learning, and data driven remote diagnostics of equipment.<p>But honestly all that above is wild speculation. The future is damn near impossible to predict and I think the presence of economic incentives going in all different directions for all parties involved just makes it a lot more uncertain.<p>[1] <a href=""http://restorationrobotics.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://restorationrobotics.com/</a>",1359081939

5113651,comment,5110761,5110761,5,0,TerraHertz,,,"Actually, there is a physical mechanism in cellular life that sets a lifespan limit, by roughly constraining the number of replications most differentiated cell lines in a body can support. Thus the correlation between slower metabolism and longer lifespan. The 'number of heartbeats' observation is a consequence of that correlation.<p>The mechanism is a little too complicated to describe accurately here. You can find a great deal on it with google search terms ""telomere fraying"" or ""telomere fuse"".<p>Very roughly, every chromosome has a 'telomere' structure at each end that acts to prevent the DNA double helix strands from 'fraying'. In the single cell embryo these structures are several thousand bases long. In every cell division after that, some random number of the telomere bases fail to be replicated. So the telomeres get shorter and shorter with each replication. In a cell where the telomere is all gone on a chromosome, genes at the end of that chromosome get progressively destroyed - thus (depending whether it's an active gene) wrecking some aspect of the cell's metabolism. With many different chromosomes (eg 26 in humans), 2 ends per chromosome, shifting gene arrangements, huge statistical populations of cells with individual telomere failures, and multiple lines of differentiated cells all replicating at differing rates, it's no wonder 'aging' shows such complex and variable symptoms.<p>I suspect if someone did a study of multiple species examining embryonic telomere lengths, average telomere loss per cell replication, replication (metabolic) rate, and average lifespan, there'd be a function of those factors giving a much more precise connection than 'number of heartbeats'.",1359081902

Giving the marines their own resources and the ability to buy their own weapons means you can focus more of your attention on just coordinating attacks and getting upgrades.<p>* Stalemates are much less common. In NS1 taking down the turret factory would mean that there's an opportunity for everyone to rush it to take the rest of the base, now every room has a power node in a fixed location that powers down all the structures when it is destroyed. This makes it much easier to force a beacon, and to end the game once the marines are down to their last base.<p>* Each class is much better balanced. Excellent Fades are no longer the sole backbone of a good team. Lerks now are useful at all skill levels. Exosuits are extremely powerful but very vulnerable when alone.<p>* Gorges are now a nice-to-have when building instead of absolutely necessary.

(The early excitement about the theory in the 1980's was apparently rather over the top.) The fact that folks like Peter Woit and Lee Smolin were able to publish popular books about their distaste for string theory reflects that (and those books in turn did a lot to establish the ""string theory is overrated"" counter-meme).<p>But within actual physics departments, as far as I've been able to tell string theory holds much the same position that is has for many years: it's the direction that most people interested in pursuing a ""theory of everything"" seem to find most promising. (Plenty of physicists have other interests, of course, even within particle physics: the phenomenology involved in interpreting LHC data and predicting new phenomena to look for at that scale is a big deal these days, and string theory really isn't relevant to those questions.) As far as I can tell from the inside, that's primarily a genuine process of ongoing scientific judgement rather than pure groupthink.<p>As a string theorist, I can see to some degree why you'd say it reminds you of epicycles: I think most of us would agree that there's got to be some deeper underlying truth that would make the structures of string theory seem more unified and elegant. The difference between that and epicycles, at least to a string theorist, is that we're optimistic that string theory as we know it is a valid, well-defined approximation to the underlying theory, whatever form that may take. Epicycles, on the other hand, were (as I understand it) sort of a hack, without any intrinsic connection to the true heliocentric model.",1359081234

I for one didn't know when I read the link, until I saw this discussion.<p>There are several aspects to this. The obvious one is that anything you put out there is going to get criticisms. Look at Barack Obama being called a socialist muslim atheist, who attended Rev. Wright's church for 20 years. The point is, if you step up, not everyone will like you.<p>Now, being denounced by people who are well-respected and with a big following can hurt. Then again, I doubt it's very permanent. If this is the ONLY thing you've ever done, then you should just do more things.<p>If you are that sensitive about something, don't release it under your own name. Invent a handle just for this project. Kind of like a limited liability company. The art of the pseudonym goes back hundreds of years.<p>Also keep in mind the culture. Unfortunately in my opinion, the coder culture is full of elitist snark against noobs who are too visible. Maybe because it's so male. I have seen far worse reactions to people's code on IRC, especially some assholes in EFNet chatrooms. Freenode seems a bit nicer and well-behaved. But saying ridiculously quirky offensive things in response to code is something coders do to each other all the time. It's just the way many of them speak. I personally don't, and I find it extremely annoying, and I wish it would go away, but it's the reality.<p>Now as far as open source ... I remember releasing what I considered to be a very impressive (at the time) framework, <a href=""http://phponpie.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phponpie.com</a> , and although I got pretty positive responses <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1682933"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1682933</a>, and constructive criticism, it didn't really take off.

That is to say, they'd buy a car phone and have it installed, then they'd just never pay the bill. The phone was still in their car, it still made them look rich, they just never bothered to use it.<p>The same thing happened when mobile handsets came out. Those big brick phones. People would actually buy them, let the service lapse, then walk around pretending to talk on them because it made them look affluent.<p>Since the carriers didn't have any way to make the service more appealing, they decided to make it <i>look</i> more affordable.<p>They came up with this plan where they would just GIVE you the phone but make you pay for it in profits over time. They would advertise it as a free phone. Who wouldn't want a free phone? It was a device that could cost up to a thousand dollars and you were getting it for free!<p>So they advertised it as a free phone with no mention of the actual cost of the service and no notification about the contract requirement. Often carriers would offer the free phones and never even tell the consumer they were being signed up for a contract, and US citizens usually don't bother to read the contracts they are signing.<p>Many years later the court battles started. Class action lawsuits meant that carriers eventually had to tell people they were signing a contractual agreement to pay for service over a predetermined term. So the carriers started advertising the phones as FREE with a tiny asterisk next to the word FREE in gigantic title font, then at the bottom of the ad or on a different page in the same publication in tiny, tiny print with letters that were taller than they were wide so that people would naturally gloss over them they put the contract terms.<p>The same practice continues today. It's an ongoing battle between consumers saying ""listen if this isn't free don't fucking call it free"" and ""listen if it's not umlimited bandwidth don't fucking call it unlimited bandwidth.""<p>But the fact of the matter is that it's perfectly legal to LIE in an ad as long as there's some print somewhere that is marginally accessible to the reader that completely disclaims what the ad says, even if the fine print says the exact opposite of what the ad print says.<p>The ad print could say BUY TODAY AND YOU CAN FUCK MY WIFE as long as it said in tiny print on a dusty card in a filing cabinet in the basement behind a door with a sign reading Beware of the Leopard, I DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A WIFE.",1359080329

Resistance doesn't develop because it doesn't get a chance. They're all dead.<p>Worst case, you kill enough to weed out those with no or weak resistance, and then spread the infection to others where it can continue to evolve.<p>So it comes down to (a) how much are you concentrating/selecting for these resistances, and (b) how likely are you to pass it on such that it propagates.<p>I think it's reasonable to assume that a lower bodily population makes it less likely to pass on, which would be one good reason. Another might be that, by heavily reducing the population, you may reduce the genetic diversity enough that they're susceptible to other factors (ie: when not facing antibiotics, they get starved out by the non-resistant strains because the resisting mutations come with costs attached).  By leaving a larger population alive, there's more scope for hybridisation leading to overall stronger species.<p>I must admit I have little formal knowledge in this area, so it's possible these effects don't exist, or have only limited impact.

hqho,0,2,0.0,1,0,"My goal in life is to have a positive impact on society. I believe I can do this by leveraging my technical skills to help people become more efficient and to help them make better decisions. Although I'm analytical/scientific by nature, I enjoy applying a zen-like attitude towards work and life.<p>I recently quit my job after ~10 years in the corporate world.  Although I was on successful track, I realized that it wasn't for me.  The money was good, but I wasn't achieving my true calling.  As a result, I resigned and started up my own software company.  It's been a huge change, but definitely for the better.  In a month's time (June, 2013), I plan on throwing my laptop in my backpack, jumping on my motorcycle and heading out to Silicon Valley.  I figure if I'm going to swing for the fences, might as well be in the right ballpark.",1367460713,1452918932

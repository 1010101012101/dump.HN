7973473,comment,7971354,7973325,1,0,AnimalMuppet,,,"I never said that concurrency was the only problem with large applications.  I never even meant to imply it.<p>For example, one of the big problems is circular dependencies.  Go solves this by explicitly prohibiting it - your dependencies must form a directed acyclic graph.  You therefore have to work out a solution the moment you would want to introduce a circular dependency.  You can&#x27;t introduce even the first one.  That means that you can never build up the kind of nightmarish hairball that large projects often turn into.<p>Is it painful to have to prevent circular dependencies all along the line?  Certainly.  But it prevents more pain later.<p>Now:  Do I know that functional programming, map/filter/reduce, and avoiding mutation cause problems at scale?  No, I don&#x27;t.  On the other hand, I doubt many projects have been built using FP at this scale, so one can&#x27;t assert that FP <i>will</i> scale this far.",1404248389

There are other commands too, and I&#x27;m planning on adding more over time.<p>Finally, I think the Chrome extension is pretty cool - the image on the homepage does a better job of showing it than I can explain, but it gives you a little button in Chrome that, when clicked, pops up with a contact&#x27;s details if you&#x27;re on their website (or Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin etc profile).",1404248160

(The phrase &quot;meaningful use&quot; seemed to be an example of unintentional irony.)<p>I can&#x27;t gleen your business model. And unless you have data access / sharing agreements, I don&#x27;t see how you can get my records.

But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun.

You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that.

In other words, if you&#x27;re going to use analog electronics and passive filters, it helps to make the selected primary frequencies as functionally orthogonal and isolated as possible.<p>Consider the quality of an absorptive filter and/or response profile of a pixel on CMOS sensor; so long as a it has a strong peak at the primary frequency, then we&#x27;re not too concerned about leakage from other frequencies into it; nor are we too concerned that nearby colors could leak a little into the other two channels because this will mostly be correlated with overall luminance, which makes it very hard for the eye to discern upon reproduction (it looks a little more washed out).<p>This is why Young and Helmholtz initially identified red, green and blue as primary colors way back in the early 19th century. They tried to identify three specific color frequencies that could be used to mimic other pure frequencies through re-combination in test subjects, based on a theory about how the eyes worked.\nWhile these colors do not correspond to sensory peaks for each cone cell type, it turns out the retina/visual cortex&#x27;s post processing (the &quot;opponent-process&quot; discovered by Ewald Hering) derives hue from the combined activation ratios, and is thus bypassed by using combinations of RGB to create hues as opposed to direct spectral activation.",1404247262

It&#x27;s basically just a slightly more compact JavaScript dialect. Personally, I don&#x27;t see the point.<p>TypeScript is closer. It offers type annotations and more structure. Being a strict superset of JavaScript also means that it can&#x27;t fix any of JavaScript&#x27;s issues. However, it also means that it can seamlessly interact with JavaScript.<p>Dart is a clean break. Straightforward, nice semantics, and none of the weird stuff. There are official code conventions, a package manager, a doc generator, and a built-in way to do inheritance. Compared to JS, this skips a lot of research and pointless discussions. Naturally, it also avoids the associated compatibility issues and annoyances.<p>The VM is also a big advantage, because you don&#x27;t have to compile your code hundreds of times a day during development.<p>As a result, the compiler can perform rather heavy optimizations, because compile speed isn&#x27;t the top priority anymore.<p>Having that VM also allows you to write command line tools and web servers. It can be also embedded in other applications.<p>Anyhow, if you know something like C#, you already know most of Dart&#x27;s syntax. Just give it a try. You can be productive on your very first day. It&#x27;s really that straightforward.",1404247108

These are judge-made “Constitutional” rights granted to corporations through misguided interpretations of the law; some might call these activist judges. The modern Roberts Court has been the most radical.<p>This betrays a substantial misunderstanding of the structure of rights and the purpose of the Constitution.<p>The Constitution does not grant rights such as freedom of religion, freedom of speech, etc., and neither do federal judges. Not to people, and not to corporations. Rather, these rights are held to be essential features of human life. The Constitution is constructed to limit the government&#x27;s ability to restrict these rights.<p>Do human rights disappear when humans come together to act collectively? This is the essential question that has been before the Supreme Court repeatedly, in cases like the NAACP, Pentagon Papers, Citizens United, Hobby Lobby, etc. (You might notice that only 2 of those made the list in the linked article.)<p>The Court has repeatedly ruled that humans don&#x27;t give up their rights just because they join together to form an organization.

7973286,comment,7971354,7972809,1,0,Laremere,,,"I don&#x27;t think your criticisms of Go are all wrong, but I do think they miss the point of Go.  Go is designed to be a &quot;best hits&quot; sort of language.  It doesn&#x27;t try to do anything fancy or new (though several of its features are taken from lesser known languages) it simply tries to do what currently popular languages do, but much better.  It will fail many CS theory benchmarks, but it does so in the aim of being productive now.<p>To say Go doesn&#x27;t do anything new is wrong however.  The language specification doesn&#x27;t include new material, sure, but the language tools are incredibly engineered.  Go get just works (but don&#x27;t use it for long term dependency management, that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s designed for.)  The documentation is stellar, and it&#x27;s really easy to make good documentation.  The compile times are lightning fast.  Go fmt is by far my favorite feature;  All Go code looks the same, and it even saves time trying to format code to look nice.<p>As for your specific complains:<p>:.:.:<p>No, Go doesn&#x27;t have generics, but for most cases that&#x27;s ok.  The saying goes when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail.  However Go does give you a screwdriver (interfaces), and it turns out a lot of things work well as screws.  Generics aren&#x27;t easy, they complicate the language (which goes against one of their language goals), and increase compile time or run time (which go against other goals.)  They haven&#x27;t said generics will never be in the language, just that they haven&#x27;t found a solution they like and that it won&#x27;t be in the language any time soon.<p>:.:.:<p>You can iterate in Go.  Otherwise for loops are a tried and true method.<p>:.:.:<p>This complicates some code, but makes the language a lot simpler.  Yes it&#x27;s a trade off, and the language author&#x27;s choices may differ from your preferences.<p>:.:.:<p>Yuck, nil pointers, I agree.  However sometimes an ugly feature makes the whole language look a lot better.  Nil usage aligns very well with the design of the rest of the language.  Gross? Yes.  The wrong design decision for Go? Definitely not.<p>:.:.:<p>Immutable values complicate the type system and require that those features occupy some brain power.  They may be nice in other languages, they have no place in Go.<p>:.:.:<p>Go has unsafe operations.",1404246175

The solution is a debouncer, a function or component that takes the input from the user and does something only once the input hasn&#x27;t changed in some period of time (e.g. there&#x27;s no sense sending a search request while the user&#x27;s typing because it will most likely be instantly stale).<p>So where before I did something like:<p><pre><code>    onInputChanged(debouncer(function(debouncedInput) {\n      // a bunch of code to fire off a request to the server\n      // then render the result back onto the page\n    }));\n</code></pre>\nNow I&#x27;m doing:<p><pre><code>    <input value=&#x27;{{rawInput}}&#x27;>\n    <my-debouncer input=&#x27;{{rawInput}}&#x27; output=&#x27;{{debouncedInput}}&#x27; delay=&#x27;150&#x27;><my-debouncer>\n    <my-server-request input=&#x27;{{debouncedInput}}&#x27; output=&#x27;{{results}}&#x27; error=&#x27;{{error}}&#x27;></my-server-request>\n    \n    <div>{{results.length}} results</div>\n    <template repeat=&#x27;{{result in results}}&#x27;>\n      <div>{{result.name}} - {{result.count}}</div>\n    </template>\n</code></pre>\nThis is a toy example, but the long and the short of it is that I&#x27;m seeing more code reuse and a much simpler development experience.",1404245939

I think with a little tweaking, you could have two columns on the front page: One with the current front page code, one with the newest stories. You might have to have titles wrap for longer titles or make some other tweaks to make this work. But that might cut back on the need to ask folks to look at new stuff.<p>Generally speaking, if you can write the code, you can make the rules people have to follow (though it does require some deep thinking, data, etc at times). If you want to compel x behavior, then compel it. If you want to forbid y behavior, then deny the ability in some way where possible. Writing the code makes you &quot;god&quot; for your little world: You decide the local &quot;physics&quot;.

This is the &quot;problem of induction&quot;. \nIn any case, even if you decide to accept induction (and therefore causality) as &quot;axiomatic truths of nature&quot;, even then you cannot reconcile mathematical deduction with scientific induction. Worse: induction is a constant &quot;working assumption&quot;, as laws of nature &quot;induced&quot; from observation have often been shown to be false, or at the very least inaccurate, making even axiomatic induction (if you prescribe to that notion) a theoretical, yet unattainable ideal. This holds regardless of whether or not we live in the matrix.<p>I don&#x27;t quite get your distinction between &quot;real&quot; and &quot;made-up&quot; mathematics, but I think you&#x27;re affirming the consequent by presupposing a &quot;true math&quot;, and then arguing that some set of axioms is &quot;false&quot; simply because it is not your own. In particular, the concept of truth and falsehood are not induced from nature because they are properties of statements <i>about</i> nature.

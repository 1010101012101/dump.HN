3211200,comment,3209601,3209601,3,0,rohit89,,,"A few years back, one skill I realized that I have is that I can recognize people at a distance. I recognize them by the way they walk, the way they dress, their height and a couple of other cues that I can't really explain. As long as I have met the person a few times, I can pick them out even when they are in a crowd and it takes only a second or so for me to realize that I know the person. I may not remember the person immediately or place him, but I will be sure that I know him. I've had a few false positives here and there but never a false negative. This is in complete constrast to noticing things around me. I could walk past a shop multiple times and not see it, not realize that a picture has been moved, not realize that my friend got a new phone etc. All these things come as suprise for me, but never with people.\nI don't consciously observe or study how people walk, dress etc but apparently my brain processes it all. I can't explain it, I just <i>know</i>.<p>I read about a year back that a person's gait can be used for biometric identification (something which I wondered about because its seems to be the primary way I recognize people). The article linked to a pdf that showed an attempt at designing a system that recognized people from their gait. It was incredibly difficult and complicated because you needed a lot of sensors to measure, bunch of high level math to process and prone to failure because the gait would change if you were carrying a heavy bag, walking on a slippery floor etc. Yet, the brain is capable of doing all this and adjust to situations all in a fraction of a second. It was the first time that I was <i>seriously</i> blown away by how incredible the brain is.",1320767847
3211199,comment,3210836,3210836,20,0,mironathetin,,,"Two comments:<p>1.\nScientists publish in slow peer reviewed journals, because scientific publication has to be peer reviewed. The reviewers are a very small selection of other scientists, who are expert in the field of the publication. As long as the reviewers don't signal white smoke, a publication is no science by definition. This way of work is important to keep quality excellent. We certainly don't need more quickly published junk that stirs the world but is found to be inaccurate later.<p>Can we accelerate the process of peer reviewing? I doubt that. As I have written, the reviewers are other scientists who have to find the time to read and comment new articles. The more time they spend with this, the less time they spend doing research. So the small amount of experts usually is responsible for being slow.<p>You may be quicker by internet publishing, if (IF!) you work on a highly dynamic field where other scientists are hungry for your results. As the author writes, this is the exception. Most scientific results will be useful only a long time after the publication, if they will be useful at all. In this way, science is much faster than application already.<p>2. The author writes, we could make progress faster. Please: why? It seems to be a sign of the time that we want to accelerate everything. It is most likely that this will only produce more noise. We need to slow down our lives and our thinking to stay accurate and produce real value. I am glad that science results, at least in my field, are still reliably scrutinized by many. This way I know that reading and spending the time to understand the stuff is worth my time.",1320767843

3211059,comment,3210836,3210836,10,0,e_g,,,"In my personal experience the main problem with scientific research today is caused by publication counts representing the sole metric for academic success.<p>Research is 'optimized' for publications and segmented according to conference schedules. That in itself I consider detrimental to the research effort. However the major damage in terms of advancing resarch in my opinion is caused by the induced tendency of scholars to closely stick to the main stream paradigms, trends and topics. Naturally it is much 'harder' to do research that does not directly build up on the current state of the art. Such research usually takes much longer and therefore results in a lower publication frequency. Secondly it is carrying a much higher risk of not bringing about positive results. Thirdly I deem the chances for acceptance in peer reviewed conferences and journals to be much lower. Such venues are often biased towards current main stream research trends.In my observation there is also an aversion against research that questions the state of the art. People who have spent years or decades to master every aspect of the state of the art have a strong incentive to shoot down anything potentially disruptive.<p>As such the incentives are misaligned with regard to the aim of science of figuring out <i>new</i> things.",1320766032

I can't remember who said it - Steve Blank? - but the startup world is currently dominated by companies who have marketing challenges, not technical challenges. If you go to a startup event, the people who need to figure out how to build what they want to build are vastly outnumbered by those who need to figure out how to get people to pay them for what they want to build. It seems like most companies are essentially building niche CRUD websites, with varying levels of sophistication.<p>But to defend the nature of this piece a bit; it is excerpted from Hackers & Painters, a book as much about culture and inspiration in technology as anything else.

So that links to posts outside the domain are going to vary greatly in quality.<p>Most of the tutorials focus on how to mechanically get something done. For instance, reading a SOAP service, changing some fonts and backgrounds, and others. This will not tell you how to design a program. It just tells you how to accomplish some small task. There is no guidance on abstractions and code organization, just tips on getting some little thing done.<p>I don't know of any design-oriented android resources. The Google Dev Guide is quite good and offers a lot of advice. Read it like it is a book. The ""Busy Coder Guides"" are highly touted, but they are again about implementation and not design/organization. Also, I have Pro Android and it too suffers from this problem, despite being over 100 pages long!<p>My advice is keep it as simple as possible. Avoid too much abstraction and redirection unless you benefit from it; just build what you need today. If you ever write an object called ServiceFactoryContainerBundle then stop and simplify.

Unless you're trying to sell a form generator framework then again stop and simplify. Just my 2 cents.",1320764635

574878,comment,574545,574545,0,0,vomjom,,,"I was all prepared to rant about how wrong he was, but he convinced me.<p>I've had all kinds of problems with PostgreSQL because its planner would choose a poor query plan in certain situations.  Specifically, we don't have a good way of estimating random page fetches for index scans on multi-column indexes.<p>I also had this weird problem suddenly occur.  When one of my tables got to a certain size (about 40 million rows), Postgres started giving a completely different query plan that it thought was faster.  The query execution time went from a few minutes to many hours.  It took me all day to debug this problem because you simply don't expect the query plan to suddenly change like that.<p>To tell Postgres that you want the query to run in a different way, you must turn off certain things, like disabling sequential table scans or bitmap scans.  You can't tell it specifically how you want it to execute.  The reason is pretty simple: SQL is a declarative language.  You declare want results you want, and the server figures out how it'll get you there.<p>I think the author is right.  We need a simple language where we can tell the server exactly how we want to get the result.  This is essential, because, like the author said, finding the optimal query plan is NP-hard.  In practice, most programs run only a few queries.  It'd be worth the time invested to try out a few query plans and find out which one is the best and stick with that over having the SQL server replan the query almost every time you submit it.<p>There could even be third party planners where it could take SQL input and return the resulting executable s-expr if you want to retain that functionality.  This way, the development of planners remains separate from the development of the database.",1240447660

I observed a poor country, a country in which the great majority of schoolchildren were not native speakers of the sole language of instruction in the country's schools, and where class sizes were typically sixty pupils per classroom, produce a lot of smart, capable young people. They could mostly run rings around me in math and science, and they were a good bit more knowledgeable about Western history and geography than most Westerners are about Asian history and geography. And, yeah, they did all that while being instructed in school in a second language, and then learning a foreign language (which happened to be English) beginning in secondary education.

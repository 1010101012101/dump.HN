Research in these areas has progressed immensely as well, and we now have methods to mine many different types and volumes of data. If you have a good grip of statistical techniques and some basic ML ideas, you will be able to single out and pick the right technique that fits your problem, given your data type, SNR ratio, structured-ness, volume, your resource constraints, etc. Knowing a little more about ML will also allow you to change/invent new methods to suit your own problems better (e.g., a new way to compress your feature space).",1268434796

You can't assume the top right of the window will be devoid of other UI controls so it's not totally safe either. Somewhere in the past I remember reading about the idea of making UI controls ""sticky"" by slowing or snapping the cursor to a control when you got near it along with using some haptic feedback built into the mouse.

So I figured I'd give it one more shot.<p>I currently am working on a site that is similar to one techcrunch posted a few days back. I have a super duper early demo if you want to take look available here:<p>onedatedaily.heroku.com<p>The concept is this: Each day (eventually each hour) a new dater of each sex will be featured on the front page. People will then be able to get some basic information, and if they like the featured dater, they can send them an email through our site. This will likely be form based and require certain elements to reduce spam and stalkers (also we don't reveal the dater's email to avoid stalkers and weirdos). If the dater likes what the person has to say, they can email them back.<p>The question is how to monetize. I have a couple ideas and was wondering what you all thought:<p>1) Force anyone who wishes to email the dater to pay 1$ per email (some of this could be used to ""pay"" the dater for listing themselves. A kind of incentive to get more daters)<p>2) Graduated scale emailing. The first 50 free, then 1 dollar for the next 50, then 3$ for the next 50 etc.<p>3) Force the featured dater to pay per email from vetted emailers. .10 an email or whatever<p>4) Freemium model -- Get more information and more tools by signing up with us. Email of the day etc.<p>Thanks for looking guys, all suggestions welcome for both monetization and user experience stuff. The UI is pretty suck, but I'm working on it. I think the idea is decent, I'm just sorry I got beat to the punch by that one tech crunch had which looked, tbh, also sucky.",1268432889

But it wasn't 100% black-and-white. There was a short scene in which Ribisi's character is reluctant to attack, and the army guy bullies him into it. I think the story would have benefited greatly just by expanding and amplifying that scene (although it was already a rather long movie).<p>Kurzweil criticizes that the technology a century hence ought to be more advanced. He says the only revolutionary thing shown in the movie is the avatar tech itself. First, he misses the obvious fact of star travel and the hibernation that it relied on.<p>But more significantly, I think he misses that while things advance, the form they take tends to ape what we're used to. Thus, our automobiles are very much ""horseless carriages"". Tablet computers are named that for their resemblance to zillion-year-old stone tablets. Since the tech in the movie was largely part of the scenery and not really highlighted, I think it's entirely to be expected that we wouldn't recognize how advanced it is.",1268432331

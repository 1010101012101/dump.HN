10052626,comment,10042469,10044687,0,0,Animats,,,"If you&#x27;re looking at new compression ideas, take a look at FrameFree.[1] This is a technology developed around 2005 at Kerner Optical, which was an effects unit of Lucasfilm. It&#x27;s a completely different approach to compression, not based on frames.  It&#x27;s based on delaminating the image into layers which seem to be uniform in motion, then interpolating by morphing each layer, then reassembling the layers.<p>Because the interpolation operation is a full morph of a mesh, (which GPUs can do easily) you can interpolate as much as you want. Ultra slow motion is possible. You can also up the output frame rate and eliminate strobing during pans.<p>Kerner Optical was spun off as a separate company, then went bust. The technology was sold off, but nobody could figure out how to market it. The delamination phase turned out to be useful for 2D to 3D conversion, which was popular for a while.  But Framefree as a compression system never went anywhere after Kerner tanked.  Nobody is doing much with it at the moment, and it could probably be picked up cheaply. At one point, there was a browser plug-in for playback and an authoring program, but they&#x27;re gone.  I&#x27;m not sure who to contact; the &quot;framefree.us&quot; domain is dead. the &quot;framefree.com&quot; domain is dead.

For the most part, this script just sets $HOME and execs a new /bin/bash. This works pretty well. Most everything respects the new $HOME and works from there (so far only SSH and Java seem to ignore this to which I think I could fix Java by setting $JAVA_OPTS and explicitly setting the user.home property). On OS X I can install a separate copy of homebrew for each work space and have only the packages in each work space that I need or want. I was really looking forward to doing the same thing with Nix when I recently switched to Linux at my new job, but was very disappointed to find out that it really wanted to be installed somewhere in the root file system.

92690,comment,92629,92629,0,0,gojomo,,,"Thanks for applying the change!<p>I now see, though, that on a <i>single-line</i> my Firefox [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.11) Gecko/20071127 Firefox/2.0.0.11] for some reason only clips, rather than adding the intended scrollbar. For example:<p><pre><code> Lorem ipsum dolor Lorem ipsum dolor Lorem ipsum dolor Lorem ipsum dolor Lorem ipsum dolor Lorem ipsum dolor Lorem ipsum dolor \n</code></pre>\nAs soon as there's <i>more than one line</i> in the PRE, the expected scrollbar appears:<p><pre><code> Lorem ipsum dolor Lorem ipsum dolor Lorem ipsum dolor Lorem ipsum dolor Lorem ipsum dolor Lorem ipsum dolor Lorem ipsum dolor\n Lorem ipsum dolor\n</code></pre>\nThe CSS change helps in the common multiline case but could still be improved. Tinkering a bit, I find adding a small padding helps trigger the scrollbar. Specifically, try this: <p><pre><code> pre {overflow:auto; padding:2px}\n</code></pre>\nUnsure why this is necessary, suspect a browser limitation, where only a vertical trigger causes both horizontal and vertical scrollbars to be considered.<p>Oh, and I also see it doesn't help at all in IE7, but at least it leaves things no worse. Can't help there, IE users are on their own.",1198651343

It takes much less devotion and study to make programs these days and its getting easier all the time... and programming is perpetually going to get easier. (It used to take HTML expertise to make a website, now it just takes a MySpace account).""<p>You all know what ""code smell"" means? What we have here is ""essay smell"": a paragraph which is so far removed from reality that you begin to doubt everything else in the essay.<p>The invention of MySpace and Facebook didn't make web programming easier; they just raised the state of the art. \nSimilarly: Cheap, quality cameras have not and will not ""obsolete the craft of photography"" (just as cheap, quality word processors did not kill professional writing). And equipping us all with Illustrator and the Gimp has not hurt the professional graphic designers. (Are you kidding me? Or do you actually know a talented graphic designer who is out of work? Could I have their email address?)<p>Also, if you think about it for five seconds, you will realize that video did <i>not</i> kill the radio star. (Douglas Adams. Casey Kasem. Click and Clack. Howard Stern. The frickin' <i>Beatles</i>, and <i>every other</i> Top 40 group in the history of rock, a musical form which was invented after TV.) Citing a Buggles lyric as a literal fact is another essay smell, BTW.",1198651208

92686,comment,92291,92352,0,0,christefano,,,"I'm sorry to say it but you don't sound like someone who has used Drupal for long at all. First, Drupal isn't a CRM. It's a framework that includes a CMS. For a great CRM that integrates with Drupal, take a look at CiviCRM (<a href=""http://civicrm.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://civicrm.org</a>).<p>Second, what you say about making modules work consistently doesn't make sense to me, at least not as you describe it. Drupal can be hell on earth sometimes, but it's the job of the developer to decide which third-party modules fit the needs of the project and what needs to be written from scratch. Besides, audio and video attachments are usually wrapped in a Flash player and that depends very little on what module you use.<p>It also seems that you aren't aware of the best practice (<a href=""http://drupal.org/best-practices"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drupal.org/best-practices</a>) of not modifying Drupal's core files in order to ""customize"" your site. Of course modifying Drupal will make it hard to upgrade! Instead of creating a somewhat versionless fork of Drupal you should be using custom modules or PHPtemplate overrides to achieve the functionality you want.",1198649451

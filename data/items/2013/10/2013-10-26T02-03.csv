6616066,comment,6614439,6614439,2,0,bane,,,"I currently live near D.C. and absolutely hate the public transit here. I could list a laundry list of the problems, but honestly, compared to SF it&#x27;s like a euphoric utopic vision of perfect public transport gifted by a benevolent god.<p>D.C. has many similar problems like S.F. (NIMBYism, weird property issues, right of way, long commutes) with the added fun of having to work with three different State level territories (VA, MD and DC) to get anything done.<p>Honestly the gold standard in the U.S. for public transit is NYC, and I love when I&#x27;m living/working there (which are far too short and far between), but let&#x27;s be honest, NYC&#x27;s public transit isn&#x27;t really all that nice. What it <i>is</i> is comprehensive and not ridiculously expensive. At least as comprehensive as any major European city and less than half the price of the D.C. system on most days w/r to fares.<p>But really you can visit any major European city and find a transit system at least as good as D.C.s...which is the second busiest in the U.S. and 3rd by length. Visit Asia and have all sense of what a good system is blown right out of your mind.<p>The level of quality in the U.S. mass transit system is really inexcusable. A nearby system, Baltimore&#x27;s, is so bad that, despite living just a couple hours away for most of my life and having visited the city numerous times, I wasn&#x27;t even aware the city had a subway system until a couple years ago - it&#x27;s virtually invisible.<p>If you consider that D.C. is bottom of the barrel then by European and Asian standards, S.F.&#x27;s is just a bad joke.",1382756316

6616062,comment,6615733,6615946,3,0,pyoung,,,"So this whole ordeal is pretty confusing.  State law says that the public is allowed access to the coast below the median high tide line, but it does not necessarily give you the right to cross through private land.  So technically, you could boat or swim over to Martins Beach and you wouldn&#x27;t be trespassing.  However because the previous owner allowed public access (for a small fee), I guess he set some precedent to access which is covered by state law (although apparently treaties with Mexico supercede that).<p>To make things even weirder, there are a bunch of cottages/houses on the property that are being leased to occupants (this was done by the previous owner).  From what I understand, they have a few more years on those leases before they can be evicted (I am very rough on these details).  So if you know someone in those units, they can hook you up with access to the beach (I think).<p>Bascially, it&#x27;s a crappy situation for everyone.  I get that Khosla wants some private beach front property to dump his money into.  And really, the previous owner should have set up an easement (easements are the primary reason Malibu is still publicly accessible), although he probably would have got a much lower sales price.  And of course, if Khosla gets his way, the public will be getting screwed over pretty bad.  With the growing population, beach/coastal access is getting harder and harder (try going to the beach on a warm, sunny weekend, it can be a parking/traffic nightmare).  Reducing the number of coastal access points is just going to make things worse, and it is going to continue to have an impact on the next generation of Californians.",1382756154

First one is having the true renaissance in last couple of years, I bought a medium chunk of it in 2008 and it gave me 120% growth by now. Some biotech funds are more than 50% since 01/2013.

6615956,story,,,5,5,kingmanaz,"Start Up Idea: Noise Warden",,"I&#x27;ve been having trouble with a neighbour who listens to rap at high volume.  Maybe technology is the answer.<p>Suppose someone created a stereo with a decibel sensor which would detect when sound crossed a lower threshold, turning on the stereo.  The decibel sensor would poll for ambient noise and increase the radio&#x27;s volume until it matched it decibel for decibel; if the external noise is lowered, the stereo&#x27;s volume is lowered, and vice versa.<p>Further, suppose this is a smart device that plays generated music.  A bass sensor tracks any rhythm in the external noise and purposely staggers the beat to clash.  A pitch sensor tracks any predominant tones in the noise and overlays a dissonant minor second.  Finally, a sensor detects movement of the device, and if disturbed while on, sounds an alarm within a set number of seconds.  A keypad allows one to enter a security number to disable the alarm.<p>Being automated, the device scans a section of one&#x27;s property, acting as a &quot;noise warden&quot;.  If the belligerent neighbour turns up the volume, their music becomes a wash of reciprocal dissonance.  If the neighbour turns down their music shortly after calling the police, the warden follows suit and the police have nothing to cite.  After several noise tantrums the neighbour realizes that the response is coldly efficient and reciprocal.<p>Using technology, a single person is now capable of making more noise, effortlessly, than at any other time in history.  Likewise, through technology communities are more densely populated than ever before.  Perhaps with technology one can also make the world a more peaceful place.<p>Furthermore, I&#x27;d buy it.

If I do, then what&#x27;s the concern? The root user probably told me what the SSH port is. If I don&#x27;t, then well what&#x27;s to say the SSH daemon on port 22 is secure? In any case, there are many other ports that are not 22 and are < 1024.

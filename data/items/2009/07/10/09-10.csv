I read it at a young age (13 maybe?) and it totally changed my life.<p>Here's the <i>real</i> takeaway: in this life, almost everyone (at least in the US?) is conditioned, on every level possible, ""do that, get this."" It's not just about money, but approval, self-esteem, good grades, a place in society, a decent life, a good relationship, healthy children.<p>We learn this lesson at our parents' knees, it's confirmed in school, and cemented in employment/college education.<p>The only <i>real</i> reason to do something is because you love it enough to bring it into being. (This is not the same as ""loving what you do,"" because the production of outcomes you love enough to create will inevitably contain work you aren't going to love in and of itself. Like, for example, exercise and practice -- not always loveable. The key here is that the love is aimed at the way you want to change the world, in whatever fashion.)<p>Anything else is some combination of carrot/stick -- they are flip sides of the same coin, and neither work well, in the long run, and both lead to burnout.<p>Even if you think you ""have"" to have pressure to produce, you don't. Even if you think you ""have"" to have a business goal to create, you don't. Even if you think you have to taunt yourself with images of what will happen if you don't do what you ""ought to,"" you don't.<p>If you can step outside this reactionary type of living model, it's amazing what you can do.",1247219688

Mono has a really long way to go before it can seriously challenge C++/KDE. I hope not to be misunderstood, moving away from c++ is somewhat a good idea, but its much too early for statements like this, because how many java apps are there to be outpacet?.",1247219552

697382,comment,697186,697186,0,0,boundlessdreamz,,,"Chrome OS is not for everyone and it will be successful in its target marget - Netbooks.<p>Netbooks are under powered devices. Even when you run a full OS on a netbook, it is not a pleasant experience to run resource heavy applications like Photoshop. No one buys a netbook to run those kind of apps anyway. People look at netbook as a device  on which they can read stuff, do some emailing or some light editing of documents. These are functions which Chrome OS can fulfill pretty easily. So I do expect Chrome OS to be a success in the netbook market. Outside of netbooks, maybe on tablets. Unlike Techcrunch, I don’t subscribe to the idea that Chrome OS is a credible competitor to Windows. So Chrome might succeed in the netbook market but that won’t put much of a dent in Windows dominance.<p>My 2 cents: <a href=""http://www.manu-j.com/blog/google-chrome-os-a-speculative-analysis/361/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.manu-j.com/blog/google-chrome-os-a-speculative-an...</a>",1247219035

I'll elaborate by presenting my history with Linux.<p>2004 - Redhat; could not get it to work smoothly on my box; switched back to Windows<p>2006 - Redhat; got it to work on my box but I felt overwhelmed by the options available and the lack of a Windows feel; switched back to Windows<p>2007 - Mac; had a Windows feel while opening the door to the Unix world; started serious work on financial programming<p>2009 - Ubuntu; using it for everything at home (programming and entertainment), but will be buying a Windows notebook this fall for graduate school<p>Linux has come a long way since I started using it.  It might be that the Mac was the key step in the progression from Windows to Linux.  The Mac allowed me to develop a working knowledge of Unix features while maintaining the Windows point-and-click environment that I grew up with.  I see all three OS's as having their own uses.  I like Ubuntu because I can pick it apart; curiosity has forced me to do a full reinstall several times.  I like Windows because I haven't found a replacement for some of the programs I like to use, specifically Excel.  I don't see why all three OS's can't have a place in the marketplace.",1247218456

It's part of the platform's identity. Comparing the two platforms about linux desktop development is almost nonsensical, since for mono, linux desktop apps is the selling point (GTK# is designed as the main GUI framework for mono, and it gives a native feel on linux), whereas Java has a much broader audience at the moment.",1247217818

These are 1 gig files (about 40TB worth of them) that are write once, read many.<p>It needs to duplicate the data across servers and make the file available via HTTP. Oh and it needs to scale quite well because as from next month we are potentially adding another TB per month.<p>So far I havent been able to find a DFS that does all the above so have been working on my own. But am nervous - the files <i>are</i> mission critical but I am not too worried about losing stuff per se (there are alternative backup solutions that make sure we have multiple static copies safe). Im more worried about not being able ot cope with the load. My current implementation is in Python and simply uses a central MYSQL server to track file locations.<p>So. Can anyone recommend a DFS option I have missed that fulfills my requirements. Or even better can anyone offer technical ideas to help with the development of our code.<p>:)",1247217226

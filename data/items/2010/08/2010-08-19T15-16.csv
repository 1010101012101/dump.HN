Of course memorizing all those passwords is a pain and using a single password is not safe.<p>What I usually do is hash a password based on where I want to login using static information.<p>Example, you want to login on gmail: First o grab the name of the service (""gmail""), then you grab the company who did the service (""google"") and then you add a salt you memorized (""kitten""). This will get you ""gmailgooglekitten"", then numberfy it (eg: all vowels to numbers): ""gm41lg00gl3k1tt3n"", reverse it: ""n3tt1k3lg00gl14mg"".<p>There you have it, a ""universal pass"" that is different for every login. You only need to memorize the steps and the salt (if you use it), and those are always the same.<p>Ps: You can use this system together with the usual password management software. :)",1282233519

My work setup is two 4:3 aspect ratio monitors which I think works much better than two widescreen monitors because it reduces the time it takes to move the mouse.  For text editing I suspect three 4:3 ratio monitors is more useful, despite providing a similar number of pixels as two widescreen monitors, based on how maximizing windows operates and the pain of trying to split a window across two screens.<p>However, when working with images, having a large unbroken screen is extreamly useful.

Flickr does it better, and continually makes it better.<p>Foursquare and its contemporaries are very clever on how they get users to use their service. Foursquare has opened up APIs to keep it simple, and their user actions are already syndicated to the Facebook/Twitter.

Nice work.<p>Now, for the money.  Quickly, QUICKLY implement automatic (affiliate-based) listings for the music gear on eBay. People will click on the links and if they do AND they buy, you get a commission.  It also provides you with a HUGE inventory of equipment out of the gate.<p>Also, give people a way to load their listing by simply giving you an ebay auction ID.. (ebay has an API for this), and it will become the thing to do.. post an ebay auction, then list it on PeerGear.<p>Finally, once your natural inventory grows, you can limit the number of ebay auction listings per category to focus on your own user base and keep traffic local.<p>Cheers!

It is great if you are working with a team then it forces everyone to work the same way and is very clear what you do in each situation. One of my favorite features of git-flow is housekeeping, for features when you close them it merges to develop and destroys the branch, when you do a hotfix it merges to master and develop and destroys the branch. When you release it creates a tag with whatever version you specify, and you can work on that until you are happy with the state of release, then when you push tags you will have a nice snapshot of your last deploy.<p>tl;dr: good for teams, and housekeeping",1282230507

But you would have impressed me more if you had read the post in its entirity, before making a statement such as ""I hate you"".<p>No hard feelings, i have done that too, we all have growing up to do.<p>I pay after the close of each phase. For larger phases, I usually break it into 70% after completion of the phase on the testing server, and the rest after completiong on the live server.<p>When a phase takes too long becuase of some technical problems, i make sure that I pay amounts in between so that he doesn't start worrying about the payments and he doesn't get stretched too thin financially. I still peg a major chunk in such cases to the completion, 50 - 30% of the phase amount, so that his motivation stays high for solving the problems.<p>It has worked very well, so far. He even has made some really great suggestions on his own, which I value very much. And I usually give bonuses for such good suggestions with the phase payment.<p>If you want to ensure others are fair to you, you have to ensure that you are fair to them.<p>Too bad, he couldn't join me full time even after an offer that was good in his own words. I was planning on giving him ESOPs later along with my other employees(didn't tell him at that though).",1282230503

Just setup a virtual safe and use the web frontend or WebDAV to upload your files. Then you can give selective access to any other user. Or you could use and distribute access codes for the safes.<p>From a technical perspective: We focused to implement a secure asmyetric cryptographic archtitecture - all content is encrypted via AES-256 and user access administration is done via public/private key encryption. So basically we tried to implement some of the key security elements of GPG/PGP within a cloud service.<p>The free account comes with three safes and 1GB of free space. Now we would love to get some user feedback: Just use our contact form on the site or drop us a quick note at support@cloudsafe.com.",1282230187

To take this a step further we name our features in conjunction with features in our project management tool. git flow feature start visitor_can_sign_in_812381 This gives us a nice mapping of feature branches to actual features. The one thing to be aware of with git flow is that the author is more on the merge side than on the rebase side. So closing features just involves merging on top of the develop branch.

Goodbye to incremental development, goodbye to knocking out a feature in an hour. Every single change you make has to be planned.<p>Adding a field to an ""object""? Where do you use that object? Is there somewhere that you don't use that field which becomes too slow?<p>How are you going to migrate that new field? There aren't tools to help you migrate. Generally, you have to change to an Explando, add the field, load every single object from the datastore, then save every object back to the datastore.<p>These are two examples off the top of my head. Every change you want to make in App Engine has similar questions raised. I really did mean it when I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.<p>I think it's a much different learning curve than with any other technology. I'm plenty adept at learning new things, but this was just unnecessary complex, with nothing to redeem it.",1282230155

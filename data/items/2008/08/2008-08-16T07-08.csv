277628,story,,,4,3,ideamonk,"Ask YC: Is hacking scene/culture/the underground dead?",,"Ever since 2007 I have witnessed nothing but decline of interest and old excitement in the hacking scene(related to computer security). Is it that most of them have started hacking for profit? Or, is it that the interest of group of people at large has shifted from ""finding flaws and profit"" to ""create something, learn, and profit"" ??",1218872930

277625,comment,277600,277613,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"It seems to me that this has nothing to do with Google.  Facebook is not a Google competitor...and Google would see no benefit from open sourcing their infrastructure.  Google is an infrastructure company--the value of Google is in the strength of their search and related technology.  The value of Facebook is the network of people--technically, it's simply not a difficult problem.  Take away the user community and Facebook has almost zero value.  Facebook happened to hire a lot of smart people who wanted to work on interesting things, and so NIH has led to lots of new technologies being created.<p>Their solutions may be optimal for Facebook, and they may even be generally useful to folks building large scale websites.  But, their Open Source tools are no threat to Google, and would have no impact on Google's decisions about what to Open Source.<p>Hadoop/HBase has already been offering BigTable like capabilities in an Open Source project.  This is merely another option--and frankly, one that sounds a bit half-baked at the moment.  But I could be wrong about that.  And, of course, Thrift is yet another RPC system.  It makes pretty bold claims about being uniquely lightweight and cross-language, but the RPC and data interchange problem has been solved many times in the past in many ways.  I don't think the world has been set on fire by Thrift.",1218872580

I'd like to address 2 needs : disaster recovery and point in time recovery.<p>For now I only dump the database from time to time, but it's far from a real solution, if I loose my whole server it would take quite some time to get its configuration back on track.",1218871794

277619,comment,277326,277495,0,0,davidw,,,"> Having done three 37signals-style consulting-bootstrapped ventures,<p>I liked the article, especially the point you make about playing to people's differing strengths, but I'm curious about the above remark.  To ""properly"" do three 37S style companies, I think you'd have to spend some significant time on each one to see where it turns out.  They didn't get big until years after they started.  You spent three or four years on three different projects?<p>Also, I'll second the recommendation for 'Crossing the Chasm', it's pretty good.",1218870318

Unless the government makes it mandatory, the product is going nowhere. Unless consumers see a clear path between the product and their goal, they won't adopt it. While improved fuel consumption is a draw, pairing it with reduced speed is a death knell. Drives can already improve fuel efficiency by slowing down. Even as little as 5 MPH can have a significant impact on fuel efficiency, yet the majority of drivers continue at a hurried pace? Why is that?

A board is decided upon by shareholders. There may be shareholder agreements (linked to term sheets etc) that grant Board membership or nomination powers to a minor shareholder, like a VC, but the power is retained at the Shareholder level.<p>The Shareholders nominate the Board. The Board instructs the CEO. If the CEO is strong and/or a Shareholder, this often makes alignment between those three roles easier, but of course it doesn't prevent the possibility of a situation like the OP describes. Still, claiming there's no recourse for a bad board member or VC is not accurate.<p>And founders don't forget - funding is always an option, with risks and rewards.",1295448648
2119856,comment,2119704,2119704,0,0,jashkenas,,,"To throw my hat in the ring (full disclosure, I work on Backbone.js):<p>Unless you're a really fastidious coder, <i>some</i> sort of library to help structure large-scale JavaScript applications is important -- it's far too easy to degenerate into nested piles of jQuery callbacks, all tied to concrete DOM elements. To that end, choosing any of these options can be a positive step, and I have massive respect for Charles and the Strobe team.<p>If you want to build a desktop-like application, with Apple-esque UI elements, I'd recommend you go with SproutCore: it's got built-in widgets for all that sort of thing.<p>For almost any other application, I'd recommend giving Backbone.js a try.<p>Backbone doesn't assume anything about your UI. You can use the templating engine of your choice, and design your interface yourself. It doesn't tie you down (too much) to a particular data store. We use it with Postgres-backed models, but folks have built apps on MongoDB, CouchDB, and LocalStorage as well.<p>If you're worried about client-side performance, Backbone is much, much lighter -- both in terms of the amount of JS you have to include on the page, as well as how fast you can make your UI. Following SproutCore's suggested KVO patterns is great for most cases, but can bog down performance terribly on pages with many thousands of items. With Backbone it's a bit easier to choose your optimizations: how granular your templates are, and how much of the page you want to re-render at a time.<p>Claims are nothing without examples, and fortunately both SproutCore and Backbone have a ""Todo List"" for an example application. Loading both apps, and peeking in the Webkit inspector:<p>SproutCore Todos: 2.675 MB Uncompressed, onLoad in 1470 milliseconds (loading from localhost). <a href=""http://cl.ly/45gI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/45gI</a><p>Backbone Todos: 265k Uncompressed (160 of which is jQuery), onLoad in 202 milliseconds (loading from github). <a href=""http://cl.ly/4626"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/4626</a><p>...

You can do this simply by making your grenade a point (at the center) and adding half its size to every other object (in your calculations), effectively, taking the Minkowski sum of your grenade with every object you check.  This eliminates the ""which corner do I use"" problem, and really simplifies your code.  Then, suppose it crosses a vertical line defining another object, going from ticked position A to C.  No need to find B, just subtract the x-coordinate of C and the vertical line, and subtract twice that from the x-coordinate of the grenade.<p>Something like this: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/786255"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/786255</a><p>Hopefully you can read my faked python, and have segment intersection and point-in-rectangle tests.

If you want to attract a plurality of users a necessary precondition is to have the experience be as good <i>if not better</i> than what you're contesting.<p>There is a cost to switching: finding new tools, learning a new process and so on. Users need a reason to switch and ephemeral arguments about ""openness"" of video on the Web just don't cut it for the majority, at least not while such a choice comes with a subpar experience.<p>> In order to make sure the Web stays free for everyone, we need a free codec to prevail as the de facto standard with HTML5.<p>Like most future specters I believe this one is overblown too. Everyone points to the GIF fiasco. The net result? PNG was born. If the screws are ever put to us on H.264, you'll see exactly the same thing, only quicker. Computing power being what it is today, the effort of re-encoding every video that exists on the Web is actually not that hard of a problem, and is certainly in the realm of what Google can do today, let alone 5-10 years from now.<p>> WebM can be that codec: Google provides a patent license with the standard that is compatible with free software licenses<p>But it should be noted, there is no indemnity against H.264 patent infringement. I'm not saying WebM violates H.264 patents. The reverse may even be true (or both). But the point is that it is a risk.<p>> We can only be free if we reject data formats that are restricted by patents.<p>The elephant in the room here is that the fundamental problem is <i>software patents</i>. They need to be completely abolished.<p>> But the issue's not settled yet.<p>No but it's a bit like iPad vs the rest of the tablets. The issue isn't settled yet, but the iPad has a whopping lead and the smart money is on it for some time to come.

It may be easier to force them with those odds (I never studied odds games much so I don't know a ton about how the dynamics change -- but neither have you), but I don't see why.<p>Seriously? Tournament chess player here with experience playing a range of levels up to and including grandmasters. You've got to be off your rocker if you think that it isn't easier to force trades with a QUEEN advantage.<p>White needs but play to the center. Play to open up the board will be inescapable. Black's only recourse (to avoid exchanges) would be to effectively give up the center or attempt some kind of closed defense like the Sicilian Dragon. Even in the case of the latter, he'll be forced into positions that will allow for the equal exchange of material or near equal material.<p>Assuming black moves only with the intent to avoid exchanges, he'll land himself in a terrible tactical position.<p>Lastly why are you comparing this kind of game to STANDARD lines that would involve balanced material? This is not a standard game. Did you seriously spend a paragraph talking about the French, King's Indian, and Najdorf? Of these, exchanges are not only highly probable, they are INEVITABLE regardless of, ""...some lines for example (I mean lines with e5 by black, not the piece sac lines) but when you do so it's not actually very good for white."" Virtually no standard line can be bad for white when he is up a QUEEN.<p>The point being: even if white is down a pawn or two pawns or even three pawns, he is STILL ahead. White has a considerable advantage in making exchanges because they are implicitly better for him even when he may lose minor material.<p>To anyone here saying that a queen is just a theoretical advantage: you know nothing about chess if you seriously believe that. I'd challenge you to play against a master, not even a grandmaster, with those odds and I guarantee you'll lose every game. You won't even stand a chance of drawing. Forget that. You will lose, horribly.<p>It isn't just a heuristic, the queen is an extremely powerful piece, with black down a queen the remainder of play is EXTREMELY unbalanced.<p>Whether or not you can prove this completely is another matter, but who cares? It's an obvious win in a perfect world. There's little to no mystery there. And it's hardly a reflection of the mechanics of an actual game, given how unbalanced it becomes.",1295447377

Context matters and it is prudent to assume that HN readers possess basic reading skills.<p>Take “most” for what it is and always has been, a simple description of plurality or relative majority.<p>(You are quite correct that I cannot just assume that the gender ratio in North America is close to 50:50 but you are at the same time also completely missing the point. Context matters and context makes “most” a useful word. It’s alright to make use of term “most” in the context of gender ratios of geographic areas because everyone knows that gender ratios are always close to 50:50. “Most” is a very broad term but if used in the right context perfectly appropriate and not confusing.)",1295446658

2119755,comment,2119592,2119592,0,0,drblast,,,"That's one way to do it.<p>Another way is to divide the screen into halves or thirds, then divide those into halves or thirds, and so on until you reach a minimum tile size.  Whenever an object moves, you calculate recursively the smallest tile that completely encloses the object, and only check for collisions with other objects below that recursion depth.  So, big objects will have potentially many calculations, but your more typical tiny objects hardly have any.  This has the nice property of automatically handling the case when objects cross grid boundaries.<p>But the funny thing about most 2D games and processing power these days; most attempts to reduce the amount of computation done in collision detection is premature optimization.  Even if you check every object against every other one, unless you have a bullet-hell shoot-em-up with a ton of objects on screen, the calculation takes much less time than refreshing the graphics.<p>We have machines that are thousands of times faster than the NES which handles this job just fine.",1295446550

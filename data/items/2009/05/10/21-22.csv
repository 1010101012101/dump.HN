Communicating well is not something that's simple to master, and few are truly good at it - in the same way that computer science is a discipline, there are myriad courses in university devoted to communication.<p>But we're trying to glean insight and information from blog posts and articles often produced by time starved writers, first time bloggers or similar. The art of communication is being lost in search for the sound bite, the skim reader- the 20 second attention.<p>Perhaps we should all commit to reading a book a week- or how about writing a short story: surely the better we are at communicating then the more enriched we will be as a society?",1241992682

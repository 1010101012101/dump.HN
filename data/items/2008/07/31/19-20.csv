263382,comment,263017,263342,0,0,neilc,,,"""Stateful XML protocol"" makes complete sense, it just isn't very informative. It describes a protocol that is both stateful and XML-based. Those are independent attributes of a protocol; obviously, you can have both stateful non-XML-based protocols and XML-based stateless protocols, but I don't see why the OP's statement is nonsensical.",1217534313

Before I was married (met my wife on yahoo personals way back when it was still free), I dated a lot of people I met online and a couple of women showed me the ""typical"" profile of a guy who approached them and they were <b>terrible</b>.

The same kinds of people that are trying to convince us that REST is a huge improvement over WS-<star> (despite the fact that once-RESTful protocols are becoming increasingly similar to WS-<star>) are trying to convince us that XMPP is to message queuing as REST is to WS-<star>.<p>More cynically, XMPP vendors generally give everything they have away in hopes that somebody with money will buy support for it. Since customers of message queuing products are people with money, it is only natural for people to hype XMPP as the ""worse is better"", cheaper alternative to ""enterprisy"" MQ products in hopes of having some money fall into their pockets.<p>Less cynically, the people hyping XMPP understand it very well from their personal experiences with chat systems and ""chatbot"" like applications including Twitter. It is easy to say ""hey, if a computer can IM me, I bet a computer could IM another computer.""

First thing: Rails, clearly. Second thing: Holy crap, I have to scroll this much on my laptop to browse their project? The amount of whitespace is bonkers. A bit of googling tells me that they made this change a few months ago with GitLab 8.0, but the bug report about the whitespace seems to have been ignored.<p>I really like what GitLab is doing, but I also really like a powerful web-based repository browser (search tool included). Hopefully they just went a bit wild with the UI and they&#x27;ll rein it in. (I also checked Preferences and they have a switch for fixed vs. fluid layout, so maybe they&#x27;ve been responsive to UI-change revolt in the past?)",1450846773

Instead, it’s grown with primitive pesticides that can be significantly more hazardous to humans and to the environment. Organic agriculture also lacks the benefits of the many crops genetically improved with modern molecular techniques, like Bt-corn, which reduces the population of insects that allow toxic molds to infest corn. (Organic corn has higher levels of the toxins produced by these molds.)&quot;<p>>&quot;Chipotle rejects modern synthetic fertilizers in favor of suppliers who use manure on their crops. This approach may be “all natural” and “organic” and make some customers feel warm and fuzzy, but it should not come as a surprise that applying stool, feces and excrement to growing fruits and vegetables significantly raises the risk of spreading disease. Bruce M. Chassy, food science professor emeritus at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana scoured U.S. Food and Drug Administration data to conclude that organic food is four to eight times more likely to be recalled over safety concerns than conventionally grown products.&quot;<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/henrymiller/2015/12/14/chipotle-the-long-defeat-of-doing-nothing-well/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/henrymiller/2015/12/14/chipotle-...</a>",1450846608

And we take it not to people who can afford things like music lessons for their kids, but rather to families who have no other options.<p>We set up a safe building where kids can go for their music lessons, and we treat them with respect. We learn their language. We expect them to practice and get better, but we are not mean to them if they don&#x27;t.<p>It&#x27;s service to the world that gave me and my brother the talent and opportunities that we have.<p>Those things I mentioned in my post are things that cut across cultural and class boundaries. Those are things that bring children--who have every opportunity to go join a gang or deal drugs or go do whatever--back to the music program time and again.<p>It&#x27;s completely anecdotal information, and I&#x27;m aware of that. But it&#x27;s working in a small number of cases. Next year, we&#x27;ll have a first generation of these students getting visas to come to the U.S. to study music at one of our universities.<p>Some of them won&#x27;t just study music. Some of them are intrigued by computers, and I&#x27;ve been teaching some comp sci at these programs as just an aside thing.<p>The U.S. is going to have a few more highly motivated, extremely talented, hard working, legal immigrants next year.<p>I guess, if I can stop rambling for a moment, what I mean to say is this:<p>A lot of education isn&#x27;t really about what you study or where you learn. It&#x27;s about training your brain to think about things in a certain way. I think that&#x27;s what Wittgenstein was getting at, in his own way.<p>I didn&#x27;t get to be a software developer the normal way. But I learned to solve problems through the lens of being a musician, which is all about solving real problems.<p>I don&#x27;t know what these kids will do with their lives. These ones that I&#x27;ve only ever taught music to. But I know that some of the ones I taught when I was 19 have already grown up to be really competent physicists, computer scientists, and psychologists, and athletes.<p>Maybe they would have done that anyway. It&#x27;s true. We don&#x27;t know.<p>But we know that the poor kids from the countries I&#x27;m working in right now in my spare time will not have had that opportunity.

If you don&#x27;t hide the details then you can never change the implementation.<p>I can&#x27;t say for swift, but there were also real security challenges. It is hard enough to build a secure library, but to also have to guard against malicious subclasses is enough to make even the most customer friendly dev run screaming.

You may not care about the extra overhead, but you&#x27;re not the only one using the language; making it the default would force everyone who uses the language to pay the price.<p>Or, to put it another way, since there are two possibilities--realize the list or don&#x27;t--one of the two is going to have to have a more verbose spelling. The obvious general rule in such cases is that the possibility with less overhead is the one that gets the shortest spelling, i.e., the default.<p>Also, if you&#x27;ve already realized a list, it&#x27;s too late to go back and un-realize it, so there can&#x27;t be any function like make_generator(list) that saves the overhead of a list when you don&#x27;t need it. So there&#x27;s no way to make the list alternative have the shorter spelling and still make the generator alternative possible at all.<p>As far as your sqlite3 example is concerned, why can&#x27;t do_some_calculation(rows) be a generator itself? Then print_some_calculation would just take do_some_calculation(rows) as its argument. Does the whole list really have to be realized in order to print the table? Why can&#x27;t you just print one row at a time as it&#x27;s generated?<p>Basically, the only time you <i>need</i> to realize a list is if you need to do repeated operations that require multiple rows all at the same time. But such cases are, at least in my experience, rare. Most of the time you just need one row at a time, and for that common case, generators are better than lists--they run faster and use less memory.<p>If you need to do repeated operations on each row, you just chain the generators that do each one (similar to a shell pipeline in Unix), as in the example above. This also makes your code simpler, since each generator is just focused on the one operation it computes; you don&#x27;t have to keep track of which row you&#x27;re working on or how many there are or what stage of the operation you&#x27;re at, the chaining of the generators automatically does all that bookkeeping for you.",1450844500

He has basically lived his whole life with schemes of dubious legality all to profit himself. He stole credit card information, and ran pump and dump schemes.<p>I don&#x27;t really like how the arm of US law is so long, but I also do not like Kimble very much either. He was too blatant and when you run a piracy scheme where everyone and their grandmothers can easily access it, it is going to be a matter of international diplomacy. The entertainment industry is a large export for the USA, so when it gets to a certain scale there will be diplomatic pressure. He was greedy and is now paying the price.<p>Edit: In before the extolling the legitimate use of Megaupload... Let&#x27;s face it, a vast majority of the business, traffic, and links there were for pirated content.

The set of jobs in each set is quite different. For example, there are few farmers in the government employ.<p>However, we can still reach interesting conclusions from the data. For example, I would expect that regardless of the salary of the job, benefits such as healthcare insurance would be fairly constant for employees anywhere, and that in the private sector, healthcare is probably the single largest chunk of benefits.

At various points the county insisted that it should receive bailouts from the California state and federal government, which drew anger from across the nation as Orange County is among the wealthiest places in the nation.<p>4) In bankruptcy, Orange County cut $200 million from its budget by clawing back commitments to its low level employees who had no part in the high level corruption, as well as through layoffs and reduced services.

At minimum, people want to distinguish their good hand from their bad hand, or the side of the body that has their liver from the side that has their stomach. I can't say anything for Australian aboriginal languages, but I'm quite familiar with Malayo-Polynesian languages in general (I speak Tagalog and Malay) ... and Balinese has definite words for left and right (kiwa and tengen). And you can elicit these very easily from a native Balinese speaker. Be a foreigner or an Indonesian from another island, ask ""where's the bathroom"" in heavily accented Balinese, then act confused if the answer has anything about geographic directions.<p>Like I said, there's no linguistic barrier against giving directions based on left or right in Balinese. It's merely cultural. Balinese people just don't do it when talking to each other. You might say, they demonstrate solidarity with each other against outsiders by using this geographic knowledge which sets them apart. (In Honolulu, which was originally populated by very distant linguistic relatives of the Balinese, the buses run ""windward"" and ""leeward"" even in English.) And besides, it's not very deep knowledge anyway --- the direction words are literally seaward-sunriseward-mountainward-sunsetward. What's more confusing is, there's Balinese villages both north and south of the big mountain, and they all use those directional words according to their <i>local</i> geography. Thus the <i>ordering</i> of the points is different. A counterclockwise turn for a southerner and a counterclockwise turn for a northerner take them through the above-mentioned points in <i>opposite</i> orders. I suspect the problem with the Balinese dancer boy to which the NYT is alluding comes from the following problem: his teacher wanted him to do something in a circle and he kept going the wrong way.<p>Which leads to the final rambling point: you'll probably notice that all the languages the NYT have mentioned are tiny ones you haven't heard of, unless you did a linguistics degree or came from the same province. I highly doubt all the big languages have always been purely egocentric-direction ones. Rather, they <i>became</i> that way when people who came from widely separate geographic areas had to use them with each other. It's easy to keep track of your North and South if you're in the middle of a giant desert or in a village where you've lived your whole life. It's hard if you're a merchant who sailed from the other end of the archipelago and walked down the streets of an unfamiliar port city, and so, you start asking for, and receiving, left/right directions instead.",1282926766

First I'll describe the text, then the apparent business model, then I'll kibbitz a little about the business model.<p>The ""chef client"" is a program that runs on servers, either on-demand or just periodically.<p>It runs a ruby program called a ""chef recipe"".  Roughly speaking, this program computes the correct configuration for the server, examines the actual configuration, and fixes disparities.<p>As an example, my recipe might say (in effect) ""Apache should be running.  The config files should be the lastest versions of package X but the virtual server names have to be rewritten depending which users are hosted on thsi server.""  The chef client checks to see if Apache is running and the config files are so -- if not, it fixes things.<p>Information about how particular servers are to be configured may be stored on a separate ""chef server"".   The recipe running on the chef client can read and update the chef server records.<p>The firm sells the on-line service of hosting a chef server for you, if you like.  They would appear to charge in proportion to the number of server configurations you host (judging by the ""up to 5, free"" freemium).<p>The firm additionally sells training.   I would <i>guess</i> that training is value priced but with discounts for customers who also make a commitment to pay a subscription fee.<p>It <i>sounds</i> as though all of the code, client and server, is under a free software (but non-copyleft) license.<p>Notice that they do not make it easy to anonymously download the software from their commercial site.<p>I would guess / hope that they are also selling support subscriptions which don't involve hosted ""chef server"" service but do include convenient access to at least mildly warranted distributions along with weakly guaranteed issue report response times (and just general good will).<p>If the facts and surmises above are correct:<p>1) They are <i>theoretically</i> vulnerable to a rival that subscribes to them (to get the lastest distributions) but then separately sells the same services for less money.   This isn't important because it's worth going to the upstream source.<p>2) They are <i>theoretically</i> vulnerable to technical staff quitting the firm and opening an office across the street.  This would be such a reputation hit for the whole product and team that the stars are unlikely to align that way.<p>3) At first glance it looks like their hosted ""chef server"" is a lame lose because it's so technically thin.   If they don't already I think the notion is that they tie service subscriptions to preferential access to the data set comprising their ""cookbook"" (resources to speed up recipe development).   In other words, they're main subscription ""added value"" may turn out to be a walled-garden open source community.   That's a pricing challenge, though.   If you're hosting the chef server you can charge-per-server-config and that's an OK proxy for value-based pricing (hence, scalable profits -- mostly passive income that grows roughly linearly with the number of server configs hosted).   If, on the other hand, you're charging just for nice access to the low-walled-garden customer community and core development/support team:  how do you do value based pricing?  A customer who is a 5 person small business needs just about exactly as much from you as, say, a division or large department of IBM:  they'll want to pay roughly the same amount.<p>4) They are hugely vulnerable, in my view, to security lapses on multiple levels which, owing to the nature of their business, can have an enormous, immediate, and irrevocable impact on many customers within a short period of time.",1282925285

Put in perspective: every Matasano employee has an Amazon account for which they can buy any book they want ever --- we even have a rule that says ""don't worry if someone else bought the book, if you want the book it's <i>yours</i> and <i>you keep it</i> and you can share if you want to but <i>don't worry about it</i>"" so that people won't waste time coordinating books instead of just getting what they want and getting back to work. This policy, which we concluded won't cost us ""real"" money ever, is much more expensive than all my $10-$20 subs ever will be.<p>But the subscriptions ""feel"" more expensive.<p>The answer to the original poster's question is: these things cost $10-$20 because the people running the service feel like they will generate approx. $10-$20 worth of value, and those are the terms under which being in business to generate that kind of value makes sense.

1639167,comment,1639028,1639116,0,0,tptacek,,,"Respectfully, Colin, but you price Tarsnap horribly. You run it like a public utility (a very complicated public utility) instead of a business.<p>You think this is a good thing, but it's not. Instead of setting a simple price based on what Tarsnap is worth to people --- a task that requires figuring out what Tarsnap is worth to different people and selecting the segment of the market that(a) you want to serve and (b) is sufficiently lucrative --- you have a fundamentally cost-based micro-metering structure that almost certainly <i>radically undercharges</i> most of your users.<p>You may think you're doing your users a favor by letting them off easy. But you're not. If Tarsnap is worth $11/mo to most of your users (hint: it is) and you charge $10/mo, you're <i>generating value</i> for them. But instead of doing that, you charge them almost nothing, and as a result are much more limited in what you can do for them. Last I checked, you were consulting instead of full-timing Tarsnap.<p>If you charged more, you could afford to:<p>* Radically overhaul your website and educate users about what secure backup actually means<p>* Commission a better user interface for people who you'd like to offer secure backup to but can't because they're not going to use a Unix command-line tool<p>* Implement more and better features on the backend of your system for tracking data, scheduling backups, backing up different kinds of data, and whatnot<p>This is all apart from the obvious point that your micro-metered pricing scheme is a Mensa test that almost makes fun of people's attempts to figure out what your service costs. Yes, the fact that it costs much too little means the joke is on you, but that doesn't really take the sting out of it for your prospective customers.",1282924834

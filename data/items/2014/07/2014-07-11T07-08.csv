But we don&#x27;t live in a vacuum:<p>--- more people knowing how to program means more people with a better understanding of the machines that run our economy.  An educated populace is a good thing.<p>--- more <i>bosses</i> knowing how to program means a better understanding of the reality of technical debt, the advantages of good tools, etc.<p>--- perhaps most importantly, programming is a vehicle for wealth creation, because it&#x27;s so free-form.  There&#x27;s a limit to the amount of money we&#x27;re willing to spend on copper, so copper mining is a limited trade.  Good software, however, has a <i>long</i> way to go before we can&#x27;t use more of it.  And since software lets you think previously unthinkable thoughts, its demand feeds on itself.<p>But I agree that a bunch of market-clueless nerds would be terrible.

8019222,comment,8018928,8018928,2,0,domiono,,,"I think the most important article to estimate Uber&#x27;s market size is this article, where their CEO mentions that the ground transportation market in San Francisco is around $22B and this is only for 800,000 people (<a href=""http://qz.com/218717/what-people-who-think-uber-is-worth-17-..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://qz.com/218717/what-people-who-think-uber-is-worth-17-...</a>). Now multiply this by 10,000 so that you are at 8B people and you have a global ground market of 220 trillion dollars. Now that number is probably too high, as the gross global product is $100T, but the transportation market can be well in the range of $10T.<p>So once self-driving cars are up and running, nobody will drive their cars by themselves anymore, because self-driving cars are 5 times safer than humans driving them and for that reason, insurances will charge 5 times more if you want to drive your car yourself. Where do you order get these self-driving Google cars? You order them through Uber and then you have Uber attacking the $10T ground transportation market.(<a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/25/uberauto/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/25/uberauto/</a>)",1405065231

A Constitutional Court could filter out a lot of the bad bills, before they ever had to reach the Supreme Court for their unconstitutionality. With a Constitutional Court something like the Patriot Act or FAA might&#x27;ve never passed, and we wouldn&#x27;t have to endure it for 20 years before it even <i>reaches</i> the Supreme Court, to decide its constitutionality.<p>But what happens if a Constitutional Court allows a &quot;bad bill&quot; to pass anyway, you ask? Well, nothing different than right now. It goes out there, and eventually someone sues over it, and it goes through the same process up to the Supreme Court, if it&#x27;s that bad. The point of the Constitutional Court wouldn&#x27;t be to &quot;set a precedent&quot; but to <i>filter out</i> at least 90 percent of bad/unconstitutional bills coming out from Congress. Other than that, everything else will work as normal.<p>The system is already used in many European countries, and I think it would work well for US, too. Without it a lot of EU countries would probably have a lot worse justice system, since they don&#x27;t even have the precedent thing, which means that if a lot more bad bills were allowed to go through, they would have a lot more judges split on the decisions, and more unconstitutional laws would be allowed to continue for more years. But the Constitutional Court filters out most of those, so the judges can only be split on a few of the bad ones.",1405063922

9802,comment,9770,9782,0,0,nonrecursive,,,"Did you read the article?  By ""dead"", pg does not mean that Bill Gates has to resort to dumpster diving to get his evening meal.  He's not saying that they're not still up and running, or that that they're not enormously profitable.  He's saying that its ""shadow is gone"", that startup founders aren't afraid of it anymore.  He's saying that another company, Google, is now the leader where Microsoft once was.<p>I'm not sure why you think it's necessary to dismiss the accomplishments of Google and Apple while at the same time being condescending toward the people who use their products.  For example, to say ""Google is popular because people like Michael Arrington, Walleywag, and those biased non-professional bloggers-turned-online-reporters sing praises toward Google"" is to imply that Google's products are basically worthless and the people who use them are too foolish to realize it because they've been duped into using them by a cadre of clever bloggers.  This doesn't logically support your argument that Microsoft isn't dead, so why say it?<p>If you want to show how pg is wrong, I suggest starting by rebutting his arguments, not putting down most of the people who enjoy this site.",1175907586

9800,comment,9770,9770,0,0,Benja,,,"I guess I'm in the younger half, because on reflection, I realize that not only do I agree, but that this <i>is</i> old news to me. I'm not complaining, though -- this article made me realize something I didn't know consciously.<p>A lot of commenters here seem to argue that Microsoft still has the vast majority of desktop installations, and that this isn't likely to go away soon. I agree (I don't like it, but I think it's true). But I also agree that Microsoft isn't a <i>threat</i> any more, like it used to be. And, on reflection, I agree that it is web apps that are making the difference.<p>I don't think that Word or Photoshop moving online is what really makes the difference, though. Every hoary Windows competitor has had a word processor and an image editor. (Sure, they didn't match Word feature-for-feature; does Writely?) But I believe a major reason that prevented people from switching has been the long tail of applications: ""It doesn't have any accounting software for plumbers!""<p>The feeling that Microsoft had a secure monopoly came from the fact that these long-tail programs were all written for Windows, because that was what was economic for its developers. Word and Photoshop always had a Mac version. Accounting for Plumbers never did.<p>Now, these applications live on the Web. And while the people using them still might use Windows, <i>it doesn't matter</i>; it makes Microsoft money, but it doesn't buy them any leverage.",1175907180
9799,comment,9770,9770,0,0,schoudha,,,"Microsoft is still and will likely continue to  be the world's most profitable software company. OS X will not reach 20% global marketshare by the end of the decade and Goldman Sachs IBankers will still be punching away on MS Excel for the foreseeable future.<p>What does it mean to be dead then?<p>What I think Paul Graham is saying, and this is underscored by the notion of ""being dangerous,"" is that Microsoft is no longer the place where new ideas and true innovation is going to come from. Startups are born from fresh ideas, and the companies that are dangerous to them are places like Google which seem to being designed to produce competitors to startups. <p>Microsoft will continue to sell $50 OEM copies of Windows to Dell and licenses of Office but this is a business on the decline. Microsoft is Old-tech stuck in the era of desktop applications, closed development strategies, and the economics of software licensing. <p>The financial effects of MS being dead are already showing some effect, MSFT has moved much since the dot-com boom, but it will take 5-10 years and continued blunders from MS to see some real damage.

I know what to build because I have customers who are clamoring for it, but I don't have the right people to build it.<p>Your skills:  Database guru, VB6 tinkerer (not a typo!), browser-to-hardware connectivity hacker, RoR lover.<p>One co-founder can complement the other, so you don't have to have all the skills.<p>My background:  10 years in ecommerce at founder/ceo level. Have developed a working app by hiring coders, and even have paying customers, but ran out of money and went back to investment banking. But the entrepreneural bug bites, and bites real bad.  Meanwhile, the app continues to run and generate revenue. A month ago, I came across PG's writings and this forum, and now I am convinced that I was doing it wrong - instead of paying unmotivated coders, I should have brought on two hackers as my partners and co-founders.<p>Ideally, you should be based in Orange County CA where I am, so we can fully develop the core system in the next few months. We will then apply to YC's fall program, so you must be willing to move to the Bay Area.<p>While I am confident that YC will accept us (PG's Viaweb experience will create tremendous leverage), there are two other routes we can take - apply for Charles River's $100k-$250K program, or completely bootstrap this and not seek any outside capital.<p>Your equity is fully negotiable.

Have you seen how Microsoft become the second major player in the game industry behind Sony PS brand? I think right now more people own XBOX 360 compare to Sony PS3. Of course there's Wii, the Apple of Console machine. <p>Google is popular because people like Michael Arrington, Walleywag, and those biased non-professional bloggers-turned-online-reporters sing praises toward Google. How many Google apps dying? How many Google apps that people use these days? AdSense, GMail, GMap, and of course, their search engine. <p>I think you read online hi-tech newspaper or surf reddit.com too much where of course the content is full of new startup that does pretty much nothing astonishing.. ""Scribd, the YouTube of document..."" or.. the X-programming language and how X is cool but C# isn't.<p>Apple is sort of the ""new trend"" these days because it looks good. Most of the computer science students in my university now are switching to Apple of course because they saw the cool/smart kids are using it.. for browsing reddit.com and talk how cool ruby on rails and DHH are. <p>I bought Apple 2 weeks ago and by the 3rd day, I installed Parallel Desktop with Windows XP loaded with MS Office and Visual (C# and Web Developer) Express Studio 2005. By the way, I'm a long time FreeBSD users and I have a machine with XP dual boot + Ubuntu (now Ubuntu on the other hand is  one piece of distribution... respect..!)<p>Microsoft is not dead. They're still up and running. They're just not visible in your path Paul. They're doing other things that do not interfere with your Web 2.0 posse. One IPTV company gave a talk in my e-Business course a month ago, she sang praise for Microsoft because they have the most complete strategy in IPTV world. FYI, IPTV is better than YouTube. <p>Let's admit it, people need to hear new information, new gossips, new products and new toys. But only time will tell if these new stuffs can replace Microsoft. <p>The other thing is, if Desktop is dead, why am I keep hearing news about Slingshots, Apollo and WPF/E ?<p>Maybe Microsoft knows how broken the WWW is and they prefer not to build their interest around it (other than just to be another big player next to Yahoo! and Google because they have pride and they want to be acknowledged that they still can be a big player in any field..)<p>MS isn't dead yet, not until they stop creating software/hardware and move to the business/consulting field. It's true that they lost the ""touch"" and that they lost in understanding their customer, but they're not as bad as you envisioned.<p>Of course you're writing this essay to fire up these hotshots or web 2.0 wannabes to quit their jobs and to forget applying for big companies and make a web2.0 thing for YCombinator (^_^)\n",1175905097
9781,comment,9770,9770,0,0,randallsquared,,,"Microsoft is still an enormously profitable and powerful company in the real world, and you should be more careful about drawing conclusions based on what a few people think in your insular little ""Web 2.0"" bubble.<p>More seriously, I mostly do business right now with small businesses (2-8 people), and some stupidly high proportion of these businesses run totally on Windows.  When they go to buy the computer(s) they need, it never even occurs to them that there is any choice about whether to buy Windows, because Windows is just what programs run in.  This kind of customer laughs ruefully along with the Apple commercials they see on TV, but I don't think it ever crosses their mind that they could actually buy a Mac for their business, much less a Linux box.<p>Word, Excel, Internet Explorer, Outlook, and Exchange are the core software apps of 90+% of small businesses.",1175905058
9780,comment,9770,9775,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"I think PG's point isn't that MS will vanish or is vanishing from the current installed user base point of view (mainly their OS), but that they no longer control the direction of software development. This is a major opening for us Entrepreneurs that, as PG pointed out, has never happened before.  <p>MS Office is clearly under serious attack now, and I'm sure the OS will follow in a few years unless MS takes a major tack in their business, which seems unlikely but is possible.  If you are a top-notch programmer brimming with big ideas, do you want to work for MS?  Probably not, and I think that is the biggest barrier they have to succeeding in the new web world.  You can buy programming mercenaries with enough cash, but the genius paradigm-shifters will be hard to find over at MS.",1175905047

Atleast in our univ, they have exclusive tie up with MSFT and they install 99.99% windows only. Its rather 0.01% apple. But some who have admin access put on linux. Most of standard mech engg softwares run on windows. MSFT gives their products at dead cheap prices ... as low as $5 a CD.

I just don't get this argument.<p>I totally agree that there's this very small, very insular part of the world that thinks it's dead, but that part of the world is apparently not working in large companies, or trading files with professionals in any profession other than design (e.g., try to find an Architect using Mac-based software -- they can't, because they couldn't trade files with each other or clients).<p>I'll believe MS is dead when they have, say, less than 70% of the world's computers running their operating system and when my corporate clients stop asking for files in Word format.

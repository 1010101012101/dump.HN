9102307,comment,9100875,9102140,0,0,schoen,,,"That kind of problem used to happen with DOS TSRs (the equivalent of multitasking extensions or daemon processes). It&#x27;s funny to think that the reason for browser extension incompatibilities is kind of analogous to the reason for TSR incompatibilities: both of them will hook function calls in the system whose functionality they&#x27;re extending, and make assumptions about how they can alter, act on, or cancel the function call without breaking things, and whether or how it needs to be passed along afterwards. If only one extension is loaded, these assumptions aren&#x27;t stressed very much, but when several are loaded the assumptions can conflict.<p>(That analogy isn&#x27;t perfect because the TSRs also had an issue about patching the interrupt descriptor table, which is where the system looks up the location of an interrupt handler; one common problem was that if TSRs weren&#x27;t unloaded in the same order in which they were loaded, the table could be &quot;restored&quot; with values that were not actually current, which I don&#x27;t think is a problem that has an equivalent for browser extensions!)",1424800716

Working in marketing gives you a sense of just how pervasive it is, what tricks are at one&#x27;s disposal, and I think an individual company should be allowed to know how consumers use and value a their products, but being able to sell that information to a third-party is where the line needs to be drawn.<p>I don&#x27;t know if Congress is the solution (<a href=""http://thehill.com/policy/technology/215457-big-data-lobbyist-congress-doesnt-want-online-privacy-law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thehill.com/policy/technology/215457-big-data-lobbyis...</a>), I don&#x27;t believe any branch of the US government has enough of an understanding with tech issues to pass effective regulation.

That&#x27;s an even tougher sell to many businesses than getting Congress to pass a law, but I&#x27;m heartened by companies like DuckDuckGo who build a product around the idea of &quot;user privacy above all else&quot;.

HN is heavily slanted towards punishing those who step outside the accepted community standards (which are heavily influenced by the site&#x27;s suggestions).  In a way, it&#x27;s sort of like a stand-in for a small community enforcing good behavior.  Unacceptable behavior has more consequences than a place where it can be forgotten quickly or be unknown to new people.  The negative consequences are carried through in a different manner, to combat the behavior that the inherent anonymity promotes.<p>There is also what appears to be a purposeful set of hurdles put in place for newer users so features that are useful and common on other sites are absent, but not impossible to achieve.  I suspect there&#x27;s some interesting conversations behind the scenes about this.  I doubt it&#x27;s as simple as being elitist or not wanting to put the work in.  Possibly it&#x27;s engender feelings of achievement or customization from those that find solutions to the problems, which the actual purpose of promoting specific user behavior.  Possibly it&#x27;s to slow discussion in some cases, so as to promote reasoned discussion.<p>Whatever the reasoning, I find that I personally take more time with HN replies.  I choose my words carefully.  I temper my opinions when there&#x27;s few or no references to back them up; I find the quickest way to cause misunderstandings and antagonistic replies is to be absolutist in statements that do not deserve to be, even if it&#x27;s an artifact of communication and not the intent.  I find the more care I put into my comments, the more useful the replies I get.  Not that I won&#x27;t be corrected if wrong, but that the corrections are more productive, contain more real information, and are more willing to engage in a useful discussion.<p>In the end, my pet theory is that HN <i>forces</i> a different type of discussion, and when people come in with expectations that it will be like some other discussion site, or similar to discussions sites in general on the internet, it appears close enough, but the inconsistencies eventually <i>grate</i>.  I think there&#x27;s a certain beauty in the subtlety of that, and my inability to know for sure whether it&#x27;s all in my head or there really is that much care put into the system doesn&#x27;t reduce it in the slightest.",1424800440

One, that the differences highlighted in the article do not predict the observed women participation rates in SV startups (i.e. the correlation of GRE scores could stay the same, but the participation baseline still increase 10%). In fact, the numeric difference he mentions (19% men, 6% women passing the cutoff) is a 3x difference, while the participation difference is more than 6x. So at best, it can explain less than half the effect.<p>Two, and this is the more important point, I absolutely claim that low numeric GRE scores and low workplace success might have some common cause, as I explained in my description of the feedback. That cause is not pre-graduation -- its effect is. Low participation in the industry causes fewer women to be drawn to the field, to be less interested in math etc.<p>I just want to point out what it is that I don&#x27;t claim: I don&#x27;t say that there is no significant innate difference in math abilities between men and women.

You seem to be talking about landlords who can already afford to buy outright, who, yeah, are always going to have an advantage.<p>> My previous landlord bought the property i lived in for £270k in the early naughties. It&#x27;s now worth over £800k. So not only does he have more than £500k profit in the house, he gets to charge &quot;fair&quot; rent which is orders of magnitude greater than his mortgage payments.<p>There&#x27;s no double-dipping. He&#x27;s made the 500k profit fairly (well, ish), he took the investment risk and could&#x27;ve lost money if he&#x27;d bet wrong, he now has 800k-worth, he can charge a rent that&#x27;s appropriate for something that&#x27;s 800k-worth just as if he&#x27;d bought it for 800k today.<p>>  Basically, if the lease on the property is less than 70 years, you can&#x27;t get a mortgage. So there are houses out there on sale for basically half their market value, that first time buyers can&#x27;t get to.

They consistently take advantage of veterans. Close to home, these companies actively and willfully take advantage of veterans benefits to reap in billions [0]. These schools actively recruit soldiers at military bases, who end up using up a good portion (or all) of their benefit without being able to get a job or before they can transfer it to their children or spouse. They&#x27;re left with no education benefit, a degree that isn&#x27;t transferable and, perhaps worst of all, a feeling of failure and embarrassment. PBS did an excellent show on the situation not long ago [1]. The standard argument I hear in favor of these schools is that the situation in the military is different, and a lot of veterans leaving the force already have families so going to a traditional college or university would be difficult or unmanageable.

HN can sometimes be very harsh or critical, so I hope that you are happy with your responses.<p>If you are 19 then you are probably worried about disappointing users, parents, and other people. You need to understand something important, which I will give to you in a story. Think like you&#x27;re a professional chef, and your kitchen gets overwhelmed: I will tell you, your customers will wait an hour for their food to come out, if that food is good. Obviously you don&#x27;t want to make them wait an hour, obviously they will be impatiently staring at their watches, but all of that will be forgiven if what they&#x27;re waiting for is good. Similarly, a good product will be much easier to sell, when you have time for it. So: if you start thinking of yourself as an adult and a professional, do not be afraid of making your clients wait. You have professional courtesy: they want your product, and they will wait, within reason.<p>If you want, universities make it very easy to take a year away from your studies: it&#x27;s called a &quot;leave of absence&quot; in English. You can thus spend a year focusing on your tool without abandoning your studies, if you want.<p>If you really want to hire another developer, you may be able to borrow money, especially since you&#x27;ve proven that you&#x27;re making money. Check out what banks will offer you in terms of loans.<p>You can do both at once, but you must be single-minded. If you want some inspiration, read the Water Book of the Book of Five Rings by Musashi -- it&#x27;s freely available as public domain online. Pay attention to what he says about <i>striking</i> (<i>cutting</i>, in many translations): &quot;When you wield your sword, your intent must be to strike the enemy. As you strike him your grip must remain, your hands must not flinch. Even if you parry the enemy&#x27;s sword, only change your thumb and forefinger a little. Most importantly, you must hold the sword intent on striking the enemy. Your grip is the same in theory and practice: grip the sword as if you want to kill a man... Striking and slashing are two different things. However you strike, the act is decisive and resolute in your heart. Slashing is just touching the enemy. Even when slashing with vigor, even when the enemy dies, it is merely slashing. When you strike, your heart is resolved: you must learn to appreciate the difference. If you do slash the enemy&#x27;s hands or legs, follow it up with a powerful strike. Slashing at heart is no different from touching with a sword. One who understands cannot tell the difference.&quot;<p>Similarly, if you want to make a dent in your work, you have to put your whole heart into the strike. You have to have the intent to destroy some bug, to get rid of some task, to finish some homework. It is very different from just investigative coding and meandering: it is singleminded and heartfelt. It comes with a certain joy/euphoria when it is over and you have made the change -- and this is addictive.<p>If you approach both your studies and your tool with singleminded intensity, you can do both at once. If you do not approach them this way, then work will pile up on one of them until you are overwhelmed by numbers.<p>If you already <i>are</i> overwhelmed by the amount of work, do not fear. Most people, especially teenagers, underestimate how much power patience and persistence have. A tiny river over time erodes a canyon; a sink will still drain, no matter the water flowing into it, if you can free up whatever is clogging it. Actually, this is the deep truth about how magic works: You say &quot;how could that magician have known I would randomly draw the four of clubs,&quot; not letting yourself think that he or she might have simply taken 50 decks of cards, pulled out the four of clubs from all of them, and put them together into one deck, so that you had no choice. If someone can&#x27;t see your patient actions, the results will be indistinguishable from magic.",1424798444

There&#x27;s a couple of things at play here. Most of them bought property at significantly lower prices. My previous landlord bought the property i lived in for £270k in the early naughties. It&#x27;s now worth over £800k. So not only does he have more than £500k profit in the house, he gets to charge &quot;fair&quot; rent which is orders of magnitude greater than his mortgage payments.<p>My landlord has 50 properties.<p>Another trend I&#x27;m seeing is landlords with the capital buying properties with short leases. Basically, if the lease on the property is less than 70 years, you can&#x27;t get a mortgage. So there are houses out there on sale for basically half their market value, that first time buyers can&#x27;t get to. Despite the fact that the cost of increasing the lease is nominal when compared to the actual value of the property.<p>Everything is stacked against the renters and first time buyers, while private landlords are afforded all kinds of opportunities.",1424797379

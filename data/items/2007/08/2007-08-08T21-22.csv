Should they change the criteria for ""global"", sort by something else than ""brand value"", or have they miscalculated the value of all those Canadian brands? Here's the target of the ""Methodology"" link above the table: <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_32/b4045421.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_32/b4045421....</a><p>As far as RIM goes, I can only ask if it isn't more of a single product than a brand worth billions? I can't comment much as Blackberries aren't used in this corner of the world if they're even available. The local alternative (ie what people in the management want) must be the Nokia Communicator line of devices.

If your hosting provider's terms of service are anything resembling sane, then keeping your code on their site isn't doing anything to compromise the copyright, and anyone willing to steal your code outright in manner that violates the copyright isn't your competition.<p>Most applications don't use or require any algorithms sufficiently innovative to be worth protecting.  If you're in the minority, then you should be a lot more concerned about your former employees than your hosting provider.  It might be worth getting a patent, but really the odds of having your ideas stolen by your hosting provider and then sold to competition and having this result in a meaningful loss to your company are probably orders of magnitude smaller than your odds of getting struck by lightning.",1186607297

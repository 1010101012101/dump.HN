15459,comment,15133,15448,0,0,Goladus,,,"There is a butterfly effect, yes there is a limit on how much you can control your own destiny in a startup.   But it's not an insurmountable obstactle.  It means you can't just copy myspace exactly, improve it in a few minor ways, and expect to win over all their users.<p>In terms of competition, you may not realize what your competitor is doing that is stealing all your customers.  From what I remember, the main competitor to Myspace was LiveJournal, and the networking features of myspace were far superior.  Customized pages with photo albums and links to all the people you know are a lot more intrinsically interesting than an article about taking your cat to the vet.  The other competitor I read about was friendster, which had a head start in social networking but was beaten because musicians and their fans used myspace. [0]<p>I remember the first time I saw myspace, all I really noticed was the music.  The random user profiles barely registered, although I remember thinking it would be cool to have a band page with lots of fans attached. <p>[0] <a href=""http://emergic.org/collections/tech_talk_the_myspace_story.html"">http://emergic.org/collections/tech_talk_the_myspace_story.html</a>

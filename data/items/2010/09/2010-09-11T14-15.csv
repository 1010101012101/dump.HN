1681638,comment,1680149,1680976,0,0,gecko,,,"I don't honestly think that Factor suffers from the same problems enumerated here at the end of the day.  I used to dally in Forth in the form of Mops and PowerMops, and my problems were basically the same as those enumerated in this essay. I've tried to get into Factor multiple times; this past time I succeeded, and I have been writing increasingly large amounts of code in my spare time that seem to flow okay. I might even start releasing some of it soon. I think the differences can be chalked up to a few major things:<p><i>Real locals</i>. Factor locals are not penalized; they perform the same as a data stack. And while another comment correctly notes that Factor programmers prefer to avoid locals, I'd point out that locals are also used in many places in the standard library. Factor's preference is not the same as Forth's near-insistence.<p><i>Higher-level combinators via lambdas.</i> Part of why they have that attitude is that Factor's higher-level combinators are very natural if you're coming from a functional language. A lot of its combinators are things like ""run these pile of lambdas against this one object"" (kind of a reverse map) or ""append all of these lambdas with this extra operation or datum"" (think of currying). These are VERY different in practice than dup/swap/rot.  I still have to pause and think a lot while I'm coding about how and which to use, but it's getting better. The main hurdle is simply not forgetting anything.<p><i>Rich data types.</i> Being able to have a single element on the stack that is an array, or a class, or an expandable vector, or a hashtable, or what have you, GREATLY simplifies things compared to Forth, where I'd have to ""just know"" that the two top things on the stack entering my function were a pointer to an array and its length or some such.<p><i>Much better error reporting.</i> With richer data types comes much better error messages. You didn't just read random crap from memory because you read the stack effect in the wrong order; you tried to call + on a hashtable. Combined with static stack effect checking, and I find that debugging my Factor code is usually about logic, whereas at least half the time, my Forth code was about getting the stack effects right.<p>----<p>I'm not saying Factor's perfect. It's not. I use more locals than the core team does in my code, and I'm not currently convinced that's wrong in any sense. But I also get a lot of mileage out of the higher-level combinators, to the point that I can write concatenative code without feeling like I did in Forth that I'm doing the processor's work for it. It feels a lot closer to any high-level functional language, where I'm just composing functions, not jiggling the stack.",1284217068

It's worth pointing out that at least in CS, you can keep doing research after getting a PhD by joining industry labs, which shouldn't cost you as many houses.<p>Re: your footnote, the exact comparison would depend on what field you're looking over from, but no, grants don't flow like water in CS.<p>In fact, there's been some discussion lately that CS reviewers are overly critical of each others' articles and grant proposals, compared to other fields. For example, in a recent editor's note[1], Moshe Vardi coined the term ""Hypercriticality"" to describe the harshness of CS reviews. There's a great quote from Ed Lazowska, who called it ""Circling the wagons and shooting inwards"".<p>[1] <a href=""http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/7/95070-hypercriticality/fulltext"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/7/95070-hypercriticality/...</a>",1284216361

1681618,comment,1679073,1679635,0,0,pclark,,,"> 1. Quora has a slick realtime UI. But I doubt it will work at large scale - think about Facebook Chat scale.<p>I don't see why you've came to the conclusion about #1. Can you elaborate? It isn't like Quora bombards you with stuff that requires action right now, like Chat does.<p>> 2. Quora rely heavily on moderators. This will not work at large scale. I can understand Google's algorithmic-only approach, but Quora's human-based approach is just too chaotic.<p>Quora doesn't rely heavily on moderators, it relies heavily on the community. There are admins, but most of the ""moderation"" is done via users - eg: assigning topics, editing titles, policing users.<p>> 3. Their topic approach to question categorization is just too simplistic. In essence they are just tags, i.e. folksonomy. No fancy Semantic Web techniques here.<p>It has a taxonomy. Quora knows that Starcraft 2 is a video game, and a child of the Starcraft computer game series, which is made by Blizzard, and so on: <a href=""http://www.quora.com/StarCraft-II/ontology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/StarCraft-II/ontology</a><p>> 4. Quora has no concept of NPOV - Neutral Point of View. It has a MPOV - Moderator Point of View. They should learn a lot from Wikipedia.<p>I agree that there could be issues with stuff like answers written to sound authoritative when they're wrong.<p>> 5. Quora has a lot of privacy issues. They also have inconsistent rules about anonymity. You required to register with your real name. You have a choice of answering with you real name or as anon, but you must comment with your real name. You also can't see the name of the person, asking the question, who apparently can add anon comments ...<p>I'm not sure of your point. Quora used to allow anonymous comments whenever, and it was a nightmare for the community. You can ask and answer questions anonymously. If you asked the question you can comment anonymously, and if you answer a question you can anonymously comment on your answer. This is useful as you can clarify your answer via comments without revealing who you are.<p>I think Quora actually takes privacy really seriously. You can delete your comments, but you cannot delete questions/answers permanently, I agree this is lame.<p>> 6. Most of the questions on Quora are just UGC junk, like: ""Why Asian girls don't date Black guys?"", ""Why White girls don't date Asian guys?"", etc.<p>Like most UGC, its one of the situations where 5% of the content is insanely valuable/brilliant and the rest grey area nonsense. That 5% of content on Quora that is valuable is life changing content from some of the smartest domain experts that'll teach you invaluable stuff.<p>Also that 95% of junk is what creates a community - Quora already has its own memes and in jokes.<p>> The only quality answers are on topics related to startups, entrepreneurs, angels and VCs.<p>Quora has fascinating content regarding Fashion, Cooking, Dating and Video Games. What you're seeing (all the great startup content) is simply their initial early adopter market. It's changing - it isn't like Quora is a ghost town outside of the Startup topics. I think this just takes time and passion for other topics.<p>I use Quora quite a bit, I think it's fun, I think it's interesting. I think their design is brilliant. I think their goal is ambitious but I haven't seen the customer acquisition models I expected to really see them nail other topics - yet.

But do remember that it is written by a professor.<p>Speaking as someone who has been seduced into academia on multiple occasions by my friends who are professors: They are hopeless optimists. This is not their fault. Indeed, it is a precondition for their existence: just as you would not be surprised to find that most of the creatures sitting on top of a high crag have wings and can fly, you should not be surprised that most professors, and especially most tenured professors, are completely besotted with their lifestyle and can barely conceive of anything else. Darwin has seen to this. The academic environment is all about selection pressure.<p>For example, this essay is by a particularly self-aware and wry professor, so he's able to joke that ""getting a PhD costs you a house"". But self-critics don't last long if they go for the jugular, so he doesn't point out that, if you wish to <i>continue</i> doing research after your PhD, it's going to cost you another house, and another: Postdocs pay better than graduate fellowships, but still only half what industry pays, if that, and even less if you calculate the <i>hourly</i> rate. And then to go any further you will need to start writing grants, and administering students, none of which is exactly research. Then you probably won't get to keep your job writing grants because it's hard to get the grants, and hard to get tenure... [1]<p>So, take this fellow's advice to heart, but be sure to also have a beer with a <i>real</i> cynic before spending fifteen years in pursuit of academic nirvana.<p>---<p>[1] I never studied CS, so maybe the grass is greener over there and CS is some kind of abundant academic paradise where grants flow like water.

The forums are abuzz with people complaining, and the devs are just now coming around that they might implement it (though when is anyone's guess).  In the mean time, the lot of us has gone back to v8.",1284214206

This case, though, seems to have been able to actually make a connection between the two (though the article makes it very clear, the vaccines did <i>not</i> cause autism, they aggravated an existing condition that brought about the autism).<p>I know people will use this case as a ""I'll never vaccinate my child!"" issue, but that won't last once a kid dies of mumps or is paralyzed from polio for the first time in decades. Overall I think this is a good decision. We really don't know that vaccines are 100% safe, and especially in infants, and especially all of that at once. We do want vaccinations, but we need to be more careful about to whom and how we administer them, and this case will hopefully bring about a new realm of research into this and it's relationship with autism.",1284214187

He claimed that flash drains battery and performance is really bad. He might have been correct, but not anymore.""<p>is an outright lie?<p>I've been recommending against Flash since the beginning, just because I know blind people and others with accessibility needs for whom Flash made certain parts of the web unusable.",1284214007

Android's strength and weakness is that it's a commodity OS, which means phone manufacturers are falling over themselves to do their own model because it's easy and profitable.

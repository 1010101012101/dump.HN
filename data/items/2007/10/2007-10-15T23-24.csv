Several interesting lines of thought are presented in this thread.  Thanks to all who posted them.  You gave me quite a bit to think about.",1192491473

68291,comment,67781,67999,0,0,Tichy,,,"That sounds like strawman argumentation: you cite a group of people with bad credentials to denounce all climate researchers. <p>What method would you propose for dealing with climate changes? What about changes in average temperature over the centures. Since you don't believe in any models, would you just ignore that information? <p>Is a very complex simulation even necessary? You don't need to simulate every atom in water to determine it's density in relation to it's temperature, for example.  ",1192490960
68290,comment,68006,68110,0,0,jojoleflaire,,,"I guess I read a few things into the question. My experience is that a ""record"" is more often than not a series of rows in different tables, and the tricky question in these scenarios is making sure that updates either work or don't work in their entirety. This is what I was meant by the ""this is what databases are for"" line. <p>It is practically impossible to maintain a useful, enforceable lock on a record in a web application, given the lack of a persistent connection between the client (browser) and the back end. So you are usually left with two choices:<p>1. Last one in wins: given that the two users presumably have good reasons for modifying the record in question, let them figure it out if there is a conflict. As long as updates are atomic, consistent, blah, blah this works best.<p>2. Versioning: Every record has a version number associated with it and the database rejects updates with a version != to what is in there.<p>The real trick is to set yourself up so that you have a single-writer for any given piece of data in the common case and defer whatever locking is necessary optimistically to the database.",1192490934

68286,comment,68075,68277,0,0,Tichy,,,"No way you would create a join with pure SQL, filling all the objects fields by hand is just too much pain. I found HQL very intuitive to use, it is almost exactly like SQL, only with a few shortcuts. The learning curve was not so steep either. <p>Hibernate does one thing, and does it well. With the annotations, it has improved even more. What parts of it do you consider magic? Magic is not necessarily a bad thing - I like the magic of higher level programming languages that shield me from the gory details of assembly language. I just don't like it if code is not readable anymore without knowing the magic. <p>I will look into Cayenne on occasion. Hibernate is the industry standard now, though, and for a good reason in my opinon. <p>I would like to move to a more dynamic language, though... <p>Maybe using GORMS (the ORM from Grails, based on Hibernate) standalone in a Java project would be nice.",1192490309

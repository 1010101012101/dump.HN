Thoreau said: &quot;Our inventions are wont to be pretty toys, which distract our attention from serious things. They are but improved means to an unimproved end.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s just that technology is far from a panacea, and it creates as many problems as it solves. Worse, the problems it creates can be of greater magnitude than its solutions. For example, arguably technology on its whole became a net loss once we invented nuclear weapons -- until that point, we never were a push-button away from extinction.<p>The tragedy of the commons is far from solved; one example is that the environment is a commons that industrialized nations abuse (and whether it will have a devastating effect on our future is yet to be decided). It is great that we have made moral progress as a species, and that we do have charity; yet how far has our morality progressed when we have food enough to feed the world yet starvation continues?<p>No, I&#x27;m not claiming that I&#x27;ve entirely overcome the bias of my brain, only that I&#x27;m aware that human brains were evolved to suit cave-man conditions, not the modern world that we&#x27;ve invented around us; cultural and technological evolution have outpaced natural evolution in our lineage.<p>Finally, I entirely disagree with your assertion that we devalue lives in other countries because we don&#x27;t have the ability to affect their lives; of course we can affect the lives of people in other countries -- through charity as you yourself point out, and in the way that our politics affect other countries.<p>For example, to most Americans, American civilian lives are worth much more than civilians in say Iraq or Afghanistan; not because Americans cannot affect Iraqi or Afghani lives -- we have and continue to do so (e.g. the civilian casualities in Afghanistan dwarf the losses  of Americans in 9/11)[1].<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_casualties_in_the_War_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%93present)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_casualties_in_the_War_...</a>",1398923990

And yes I was speaking about culture.<p>She was absolutely brilliant, probably somewhere up there in the top thinkers in history. But building a functional society is obviously exceptionally difficult, and the highest level arguments seem to me more of a thought game for academics then a practical solution to a pressing and absolutely real societal problem. I guess the reason I wrote the article is because at times misenterpretation of complex ideas can be dangerous.

Chrome now looks like a half-burnt Firefox, with an emaciated URL in a separate box from what has effectively become a search bar. The same two boxes are there, only their sizes are reversed -- accurately reflecting the respective vendors&#x27; priorities.<p>Expect Google to make more changes along the same line. What, did you really think they were funding Chrome out of a kindness of heart? Now that Chrome is a leading (if not <i>the</i> leading) browser, it&#x27;s time to make some money. Google is the new Microsoft. They have the power to change the web as it sees fit, but instead of safeguarding the open web, they&#x27;ll try to replace it with a walled garden.

Conversely, in the years to come those who do not at least have a basic idea of how programming is done will be at an acute disadvantage (politically, socially, financially, culturally) much like the illiterate following society’s adoption of the written word.<p>Potential hyperbole and the fact that Rushkoff was talking about programming more so than general computer knowledge aside, I still think there&#x27;s a relevant point there.

After all, who cares about street addresses? The address is occuplied by a Starbucks and we&#x27;re in Mountain View, so let&#x27;s just show a Starbucks logo surrounded by a shape that vaguely looks like an outline of Mountain View. You want to go someplace else? We&#x27;ll show you your destination and the series of turns you need to make to get there, but we won&#x27;t show you anything else on the way.<p>If you think a preschooler doesn&#x27;t need to know how URLs work, you are vastly underestimating the curiosity of a typical preschooler. If you show him a bar with a bunch of letters in it, he&#x27;ll start typing random letters into that box to see what happens. Likewise, if you show him a detailed map of the town, he will want to explore parts that he&#x27;s never been to so far. Tinkering and exploration are the foundation of every science, including computer science. Therefore, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea to discourage tinkering and exploration, whether in a car or in a browser, unless the benefits greatly outweigh the long-term costs.<p>With cars, the benefits are probably quite large, since complexity is exactly what makes modern cars so safe and efficient. With browsers, I&#x27;m not even sure what the benefits are supposed to be, other than the obvious financial benefit to Google. People who don&#x27;t want to tinker with the URL bar will just ignore it most of the time. Also, we&#x27;re talking about the desktop browser here. There are plenty of pixels to waste.",1398922845

She actually said she had no deep interest in politics other than to define a rational base for capitalism so she (and those like her) could be left alone to create. That was the basis for the title of her novel that free individuals are the fountainhead of all the values we enjoy. Her primary stated goal was to present the ideal man in her novels. In order to do that she discovered that she had to define her own philosophy of Objectivism. A complete philosophy doesn&#x27;t start with politics or society but more basic questions such as the nature of existence, consciousness, knowledge, reason and ethics which all have to be defined to intelligently discuss politics (the highest level).<p>In reading your article and replies to others I see that the goal in your article wasn&#x27;t to explain or discuss Objectivism so much but to explain the <i>cultural phenomenon</i> of Ayn Rand&#x27;s popularity.  My recommendation would be to read some of her non-fiction works like the one I recommended on selfishness.  BTW, she qualified her advocacy of selfishness as acting on ones <i>rational</i> self interest, not emotional indulgence as you implied. (This is a common misrepresentation of her view).  Also, she thought that emotions were important and essential to the human experience but they are not primaries nor means to knowledge. If you are interested in what Rand was all about you should also read her books <i></i>Philosophy Who Needs It<i></i> and <i></i>Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal<i></i>.",1398922623

I know it&#x27;s just the word of some guy on the internet but a while back I got so fed up with dumb comments that I promised myself I would never comment on something without having first read it in an honest fashion.<p>Next, I would say that your comment is still somewhat frustrating to me. My tone may have been overly combative, but I was legitimately asking questions in the hope of getting an answer or at least pointed to one.  So I hope you can understand my frustration when you dismiss three paragraphs of my writing as misunderstanding what TDD provides.  The may be true, but if you&#x27;re going to spend time typing those words I feel like you could at least type a few more either taking a stand on what you believe TDD to be or pointing out some resources that I could use to educate myself. As it is you&#x27;ve told me I&#x27;m wrong but not how or why.<p>As for most software being composed of stuff that is simple in the aggregate, I again disagree but this may be my ignorance.  Again, most of my experience in software has come on large systems where each object has several collaborators, each of which may also have several collaborators, recursively continuing out. The two options I see for TDD are either to spend considerable effort setting up these collaborators, or to mock them out. If I mock them out, I am coupling myself to the internals of how the method is implemented, because I have to give explicit implementations of each method called in the course of the method doing its job.  If the method changes, the mock has to change, and the test breaks, even if the surface behavior of the object may not change.<p>I may be missing something here, but this is the reality of software as I experience it. Answers that say any of the following do not help me, and honestly I consider any of these evidence that TDD is not cure-all it is made out to be:<p>1) You&#x27;re doing it wrong, where wrong is any case TDD has failed, essentially making it unfalsifiable\n2) Your system is poorly written and doesn&#x27;t work for TDD, essentially condemning the vast pool of legacy that makes the world spin to be without tests, or refactored/rewritten without adding user value\n3) Your understanding is incomplete, without ever specifying what it would take to have a complete understanding or how to go about gaining this, with a similar symptom as case 1.<p>I appreciate that you take a more balanced approach to TDD advocacy. I should do a better job of separating you from people like &quot;Uncle Bob&quot; from whom I took the direct quote about not being a professional. I have also dealt with several TDD advocates throughout my career whose responses to questioning TDD have fallen into the previous 3 categories. Because of this I sometimes find it hard to separate more reasoned TDD advocacy from the former, and so my apologies if I misinterpreted the strength of your message.",1398922223

Maybe the difference is\nswipes versus clicks or some such, in which case &#x27;screen&#x27; is\nnot really the point.<p>The issue is being clear when using words with meanings\nthat are not in a standard dictionary.  Such a word is a\n&#x27;term&#x27; and, thus, needs at least a definition and likely \nalso motivation, explanation, and examples.  Else are\non the way to jargon and gibberish.<p>Such bad writing is endemic in practical computing and a big, huge, problem for the field.  Even computer science \nvery much needs to &#x27;up its game&#x27; to catch up with physics and especially mathematics.<p>Apparently my little lesson in good technical writing 101\nrubbed some feathers the wrong way, but the lesson stands --\ngood definitions are crucial, and &#x27;multi-screen&#x27; screams out for a good definition.<p>It still is not clear, without a lot of guessing, just\nwhat is the significance of any definition of &#x27;multi-screen&#x27; for building a Web site.  That is, the Web site \nmostly shouldn&#x27;t care.  E.g., I&#x27;m building a Web site, and the pages look fine, and there is no logic at all in either the server or what is sent to the client on what the heck the screen size is.  My solution:  Each Web page is exactly 800 pixels wide.  Period.  If the actual window used on the client device is less than 800 pixels wide, then the client\ndevice is welcome to add horizontal scroll bars.  For JavaScript, I have tried hard not to write any and so far\nhave been successful although some of Microsoft&#x27;s software\nwrites some JavaScript for me.  So, in particular, for my Web site, I still can&#x27;t find a meaning of &#x27;multi-screen&#x27; that is useful.<p>I&#x27;m talking about good definitions and clear communications.",1398921661

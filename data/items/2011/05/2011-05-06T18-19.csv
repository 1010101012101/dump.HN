2522062,comment,2521416,2521712,8,0,akdubya,,,"Good background from the bitcoin people:<p>""A number of Byzantine Generals each have a computer and want to attack the King's wi-fi by brute forcing the password, which they've learned is a certain number of characters in length. Once they stimulate the network to generate a packet, they must crack the password within a limited time to break in and erase the logs, lest they be discovered. They only have enough CPU power to crack it fast enough if a majority of them attack at the same time.<p>They don't particularly care when the attack will be, just that they agree. It has been decided that anyone who feels like it will announce an attack time, which we'll call the ""plan"", and whatever plan is heard first will be the official plan. The problem is that the network is not instantaneous, and if two generals announce different plans at close to the same time, some may hear one first and others hear the other first.<p>They use a proof-of-work chain to solve the problem. Once each general receives whatever plan he hears first, he sets his computer to solve a difficult hash-based proof-of-work problem that includes the plan in its hash. The proof-of-work is difficult enough that with all of them working at once, it's expected to take 10 minutes before one of them finds a solution and broadcasts it to the network. Once received, everyone adjusts the hash in their proof-of-work computation to include the first solution, so that when they find the next proof-of-work, it chains after the first one. If anyone was working on a different plan, they switch to this one, because its proof-of-work chain is now longer.<p>After about two hours, the plan should be hashed by a chain of 12 proofs-of-work. Every general, just by verifying the difficulty of the proof-of-work chain, can estimate how much parallel CPU power per hour was expended on it and see that it must have required the majority of the computers to produce in the allotted time. At the least, most of them had to have seen the plan, since the proof-of-work is proof that they worked on it. If the CPU power exhibited by the proof-of-work is sufficient to crack the password, they can safely attack at the agreed time.""<p><a href=""http://www.bitcoin.org/byzantine.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bitcoin.org/byzantine.html</a>",1304708348

Maybe piggyback on chromeos or android to get secure p2p app installation.<p>I also had some thoughts about the CALM hypothesis (<a href=""http://www.bloom-lang.net/calm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloom-lang.net/calm/</a>) which I haven't seen mentioned in the literature. A monotonic bloom program is one in which every delivery order for a given set of messages results in the same state. For many protocols what I actually care about is that every possible end state is equivalent, for some protocol-specific notion of equivalence. For example, for leader election all I care about is that every end state should have exactly one leader. Monotonic programs are easy to model check and I think explicitly stating the desired equivalence relations will reduce the state space explosion at points of order. It might be possible to get good results from a very simple/naive model checker by exploiting this.<p>Not hugely related to the article, but its been on my mind a lot lately.",1304707485

My point was ""yes, they are watching...but who cares??"" If you have something you want to hide from the government (or other organization), encrypt it.<p>Also, even having access to my home network (which is firewalled once by my router, and again by my computer) there is still no way to just ""flip the switch"" and monitor my webcam. I would have to<p>a. have a port available PUBLICLY through both firewalls that allowed someone to connect and view a live stream of my cam (which would require streaming software running in the background, AKA I'd have to purposefully turn it on) or<p>b. have a trojan installed unbeknownst to me that somehow figures out, in every model of laptop, how to turn on the camera but disable the ""camera is on"" hardware light, connect to a remote server (without the operating system knowing about it (not bloody likely)) and send a stream of everything happening. There would have to be a standard API implemented by <i>all</i> PC/camera manufacturers that allows this trojan to do this, which has also been kept entirely secret (impossible, if more than one organization is involved) and also the trojan would have to be installed on all computers and ignored by all virus scan software. The trojan would also have the ability to open a hidden connection that the operating system would allow but not report as an active connection.<p>Like I said previously, this is ridiculous. Perhaps this could MAYBE happen in Windows/Mac (good luck keeping this secret), but not an open-source OS like linux. So yes, maybe you don't know how to do it, but I do...and I'm telling you that I would have to purposefully allow it to happen. Please don't spread misinformation just because you think it may be possible or because you saw it in a movie.<p>Also, note that at no point did I call you paranoid or mention a tinfoil hat.

Your computer is connected to the largest public network in the world...consider it a free for all. Your cell phone transmits information using radio waves...meaning anybody (<i>anybody</i>) can listen in.<p>2. Nobody cares what you are doing or saying.

They released their code under the LGPL, and its Apple's obligation to honor this license until they remove all the original code or get contributers to sign a copyright assignment form.  That's how open source projects work: either all the code is owned by some central entity, or the code is owned by the various contributers.  When the code is owned by the contributers, your patch is considered a derivative work (for the purpose of copyright) of the other copyright holders' work, so you have to follow the license.  On the flip side, if every patch has documentation saying that the central authority (the FSF, the Apache Foundation, etc.) has copyright, then that central authority can relicense however they want.  For example, Emacs is now GPLv3, even though most of the code was written well before the GPLv3 existed.<p>In the case of Webkit, Apple does not require copyright assignment.  The code was not originally theirs - their version of Webkit is a fork of KHTML, and so the copyright from KHTML is in force.  They have to follow the LGPL, because otherwise they have no legal right to use the code in their products.<p>That's all I'm saying: the question was ""who has a legal claim over Webkit"", and my answer was ""everyone who's contributed"".<p>The LGPL allows Apple to keep the rest of their stack that links against Webkit proprietary.  However, they have to release their changes to Webkit.<p>Here is the exact wording from the LGPL v2:<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.

         to distribute the source-code to anyone

But WebKit got so valuable precisely because it is open-source such that it can be a defacto standard for mobiles. Apple is also not the sole contributer, and they benefited from the work of others, so I don't see why they aren't playing nice.<p>Also, lots of double standards floating around -- I'm seeing some people that cried wolf on Google's actions regarding postponing the release of Android 3.0, although they are complying with the licenses involved and although they had perfectly understandable business reasons for doing so -- those people are actually trying to justify Apple's actions right now.<p>I don't know why we treat these stories like some kind of sport, in which everyone cheers for their favorite, but we do, although there isn't anything to gain unless you're a shareholder.",1304706120

Absolutely not: if it keeps it, it will become literally impossible for fast-growing startups to stay in the city, and San Francisco will <i>lose</i> a significant amount of payroll taxes from those startups leaving.<p>Blindly support all taxes if you will, but the facts are that San Francisco is the only major city to tax <i>companies</i> on employees' personal gain from stock options, that it would be untenable for any fast-growing startup to be based in SF with this tax, and that the city does not currently receive any revenue from it, so there will be no revenue to make up.",1304706012
2521903,comment,2521449,2521731,2,0,MacSlavo,,,"Thanks for posting the rebuttal to the article I wrote over at SHTFplan. While I won't disagree with your assessment that ""nobody cares,"" it's become increasingly clear that all digitally processed data is being fused into complex 'social network' like databases. The Fusion centers mentioned in the article do just this. They aggregate data looking for flags.  No, there isn't a person sitting around listening specifically to your phone calls, or specifically monitoring your internet traffic or emails... It's all plugged into digital monitoring systems. You really don't matter.... until you're flagged.<p>We can play this game all day long, but the fact of the matter is that systems like this do exist. Operation Echelon, as I pointed out in this article, is designed for this specific purpose and has been used extensively in over 15 countries in Europe in the 1990's, and has likely expanded by now. This is verifiable and confirmed by the US and British governments - just look it up - don't be scared. Computers ARE listening to your conversations utilizing speech recognition technology. And if you happen to say a keyword, or string of keywords, the conversation is flagged and dispatched for human analysis. This is FACT, not tin foil stuff.<p>With regards to cell phones and the comment from ""fredu golon"" here in your rebuttal, again, this is not science fiction. This is CONFIRMED by the FBI as early as 2006. It's called ""Roving Bug"" technology and it is active in most every cell phone that comes to market: <a href=""http://news.cnet.com/2100-1029_3-6140191.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/2100-1029_3-6140191.html</a> . While the 'camera' side of this is unconfirmed, it's obvious that the technology is possible and likely in use right now.<p>Likewise is the technology possible to monitor microphones and cameras on your home PC... It's as simple as accessing your network. While I certainly don't know how to do it. And you don't know how to do it. Are you really of the thought that top-level intelligence agencies do not have this capability? And if they do, how long before the technology is integrated with monitoring systems so that computers can, at the push of a button, listen to entire networks of users having conversations at home? My view is that the purpose Fusion networks and centers is exactly this over the long-term.<p>I have no paranoia or delusions about what's going on here, and I realize I am but a speck of dust on a beach of billions of digitally-connected internet and cell phone users. The point here was not to necessarily suggest the YOU, specifically, are being monitored, but that the system as a whole has the capabilities to do so and is actively doing it right now.<p>Call it tin foil, that's fine. But the evidence, some of which was cited above, simply cannot be denied.<p>Thanks.<p>Mac Slavo

The difference is that Wikipedia, as the sole channel for editing markup, could have easily rejected syntax errors with helpful messages instead of silently compensating.<p>If it was anything else, I'd say ""who cares,"" but this is ""the world's knowledge"" -- we absolutely should care about the format it's stored in.

While admittedly mildly trollish, it disparages java along with C#/ruby/python implicitly in favour of C++ only because C++ has the most 'correct' implementation of RAII.<p>There is no argument against try/catch/finally, the argument is that the most common usage of try blocks is for dealing with resource management, not actual exceptions in program state.  Given exceptions should be used to expression 'exceptional' program states, that is a significant downside to code readability.<p>Syntactic sugar like using/yield/with blocks improve the signal to noise ratio of try block usage but still rely on programmer acceptance of that idiom.  Ideally, the responsibility of cleanup would be moved entirely to the class implementation rather than the consumer. C++ did this with destructors.  In a managed world where maybe you don't always want an eager dispose, rather than syntactic sugar in the caller, move it to the signature of the dispose.  Something along the lines of<p>public scoped void Dispose() { 
  ....
}<p>Alternatively, @Scoped or <Scoped> if you don't want more keywords.  The topic is partly to blame but RAII is orthogonal to whether a language is garbage collected or not.

Then, no other blog/press will cover it because its ""dead news"" regardless of it may have value to their readers -- even if they're a few minutes behind.<p>Obviously, its a bit of a gray area.

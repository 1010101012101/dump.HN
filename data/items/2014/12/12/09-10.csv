8739268,comment,8738939,8739228,0,0,vidarh,,,"The point is &quot;general processing tasks&quot; tends to include lots of very generic parts that are great to offload.<p>E.g. go back to the 80&#x27;s and it was not uncommon for loading data to involve having your main CPU load data a <i>bit</i> at a time via a GPIO pin, during which time your application code was blocked until the transfer was complete. Then a byte at  time. Then a block at a time. Then suddenly we got DMA.<p>These days we expect other threads to go on executing, and application code that wants to, will expect async background transfer of data to not consume all that much CPU.<p>Here&#x27;s a contrived example of possible many-wimp-core offloading for you (that would be complicated, but possible):<p>Consider an architecture where many wimpy cores can &quot;hang&quot; on reads from a memory location, and start executing as soon as there&#x27;s an update. A &quot;smart&quot; version would use a hyper-threading type approach to get better utilization.<p>Congratulations, you know have a &quot;spreadsheet CPU&quot; that automatically handles dependencies (would need some deadlock/loop resolution mechanism) and does recalculation as parallel as possible by the combination of data dependencies and number of cores/threads.<p>It&#x27;s also incidentally an architecture where caches would be a nightmare, and where the performance of individual cores would not be a big deal.<p>Of course not many of us have spreadsheets where recalculation times is an issue, and it&#x27;s easy to handle recalculation on a single big CPU too. Where the sweet spot is in terms of power usage, latency and throughput is hard to say, though.<p>(not saying it&#x27;d necessarily be a good idea, but I now want to do a test-implementation for my 16-core Parallela&#x27;s just because).<p>But PC users dismissed the parallelism of the Amiga too. Until Windows 95 had proper multi-tasking and they all had graphics and sound cards. Suddenly they saw the value.<p>I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll know how far we can push offloading without trying.",1418377609

End-to-end encryption is the natural solution to the problem of universal surveillance as well as more mundane issues, like companies losing data and servers getting hacked. I think it&#x27;s very elegant that one can build useful services with untrusted servers.<p>The algorithms for end-to-end encryption are there, but usability of actual implementations has been pretty terrible so far.  For example, compare the usability of Gmail vs Thunderbird+Enigmail. Or compare the usability of Dropbox and Tarsnap. I&#x27;ve actually wondered why there isn&#x27;t a good end-to-end encrypted Dropbox alternative that&#x27;s remotely as easy to use. I hope this works out.<p>Beautiful, usable end-to-end encrypted software is the future. See, for example, Keybase, @moxie&#x27;s Signal or Whatsapp. The only caveat is that writing secure software is really hard. I just made a disk42 account, but I&#x27;ll treat it as a untrusted demo until it&#x27;s had more test mileage and outside code review.<p>Also, curious:<p>* How do you detect changes in the synced folder?<p>* How do you do conflict resolution (if a file is edited simultaneously on two different client machines)?<p>* What algorithms, key sizes, etc do you use for the actual encryption?",1418377460

Everybody can be rational and still be worse off - prisoner&#x27;s dilemma is a canonical example.<p>Economic fallacy there is, but it&#x27;s in standard economic theory. Standard economics claims that only sensible things to do are investment and consumption, and considers savings to be a waste. But the savings are not waste for individual economic entities; savings are a way of gaining power in economics.<p>Let me give a couple examples, consider two companies, company A which saves (has large quantities of liquid capital), the other B which doesn&#x27;t (and invests everything into machinery, better production, etc.).<p>First example: A stealthy startup appears with a completely new (&quot;disruptive&quot;) technology. Company B cannot buy it, so the company A is at advantage.<p>Second example: Workers decide to strike for higher wages. Company A can survive the long strike by taking hit on it&#x27;s monetary reserves, perhaps pay strikebreakers, etc. Company B cannot do anything and have to give in to the strikers demands.<p>In other words, savings are a way to break out of the market system, and so people do it and race who does it better, because they want power (which comes from ability to <i>react</i>). Economy as a whole suffers; but why should the winning actor care?",1418376788

8739204,comment,8738939,8738939,0,0,vidarh,,,"Consider that we <i>have</i> parallel stupid small cores, and have had them for years: Most harddrives have full CPU&#x27;s on the controllers these days, and there are full CPU cores all over the place outside of our &quot;view&quot;. E.g. consider things like the Transcend Wifi SD cards with ARM SoC&#x27;s on board. Many hard drive controllers have full CPUs. You find embedded CPUs &quot;hidden&quot; in all kinds of PC hardware these days.<p>The PC architecture started out being hampered by the CPU + dumb peripherals architecture, but this was a big departure from the norm during that era. In the &quot;home&quot; market, most machines either had CPUs too weak to drive the peripherals (my first &quot;parallel stupid small cores&quot; system was a Commodore 64 + a 1541 disk drive - you could, and people did, and wrote book about, download your own code to the 1541 and do computations on it) or explicitly used CPUs or co-processors all over the place to offload things, like the Amiga.<p>My A2000 had of course the 68000 (and later a 68020 accelerator), but also had a 6502 compatible core running the keyboard, a Z80 on the SCSI controller card, on top of the Amiga&#x27;s custom chips which had the copper, blitter and sound chips that all had limited programmability. The irony is that it perhaps made a lot of us overly gung ho on the 680x0 line (though it does have a beautiful instruction set) because our machines felt so much faster than comparably clocked PCs - hence many of use were ok with not upgrading CPU models and clock rates as fast as in the PC world.<p>It was first when PC&#x27;s started sprouting co-processors (graphics cards and sound cards with advanced capabilities first), that the Amiga truly lost its edge (at the same time Motorola failed to deliver fast enough versions of their newest 680x0 models, faster CPU&#x27;s would have been insufficient) - until then the co-processors and philosophy offloading everything possible had compensated for the by then anaemic average CPU speeds.<p>Though the 3rd party expansions gave one more fascinating multi-processing step: Systems that would let you run 680x0 and PPC code on the same machine (PPC cpu on the expansion card, 680x0 on the motherboard).<p>PCs have been steadily sprouting more small cores. They&#x27;re just not as visible.<p>On the server side it is extreme: I have single CPU servers at work where the main CPU may have 6-8 x86 cores, but where there may be 30+ ARM or MIPS cores when you tally up the harddrives (dual or tri-core in many cases), RAID controllers, IPMI cards, some networking hardware etc.. But these cores are getting so cheap and so small that we should expect to continue to see offloading of more functionality.<p>On the Amiga, this was what was our day to day reality. SCSI was always favoured, for example, because it was lighter on the CPU than IDE was (hence universal disdain for the guy that forced engineering to put IDE in the last Amiga models - the A4000 and 1200 - which helped cripple them at a time when they were lagging in overall CPU performance; the man in charge at Commodore the time was the guy that had been responsible for the PCjr disaster..), because it offloaded more logic (and hence was more expensive, hence the cut).<p>Rather than be exposed to the parallelism, expect that we&#x27;ll see more higher level functionality being subsumed into peripherals so that the main CPU gets to focus on running your code. E.g. there are TCP offload functionality on some high end network cards.<p>Just like in the architectures born in the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s out of necessity because of wimpy CPUs...<p>The &quot;one CPU to rule them all&quot; PC is an aberration, born out of a time when CPUs where getting to a performance level where it was possible, and where the norm of single-tasking OSs for personal computers meant it for a short few years seemingly made little difference if the main CPU spent all its time serving disk interrupts while loading stuff.<p>The norm in computing have been multiple parallel cores. Even multiple parallel CPUs. Often on multiple buses.<p>And over the last few years we&#x27;ve gone full circle.",1418376362

Heat, size, are not as relevant (but not irrelevant).<p>iPhone and iPad are obviously clients.  A Mac Pro is a Server.  A macbook air is probably a client (though, ironically, it is far more powerful than the $10K servers I had in 1999).   A MacBook Pro falls somewhat in the middle, but leans towards client.  An iMac is also in the middle, but leans towards server.<p>I think the angst (which I have to some degree as well) about the distinction between Client vs Server, is because it&#x27;s not completely clear how to position the Mac Pro and iMac.

Many things in git rely on you having a powerful shell, which is not the case on Windows (who wants to use cygwin all the time?).<p>In Mercurial I never lost a commit, even as a beginner. In git I managed to accidentally make commits unreachable (yes, I know how to recover, but still, it tooks a bit of googling and trying).<p>I very rarely need git&#x27;s &quot;remotes&quot; feature. There&#x27;s rarely a need for me to know where someone else&#x27;s master is at the moment. I understand why git is doing this and I get that it&#x27;s pretty flexible, but most of the time Mercurial&#x27;s simple branching model is enough for me (I don&#x27;t like bookmarks, they confuse the hell out of me).<p>Also, my repositories are usually small enough that I don&#x27;t notice the Python overhead compared to Git. My ultra slow old disk is more of a problem in that case.<p>Mercurial&#x27;s help is <i></i>MUCH<i></i> better than git&#x27;s. Git&#x27;s manpages are so famous for being mostly useless that people even write joke tools that generate gibberish manpages. Mercurial has a very clean documentation, with `hg help ...` just showing you what you need to know instead of (on Windows) using your browser to render an HTML manpage.<p>And lastly: Will git 2.0 ever come out for Windows? Seems like nobody is working on that, so we Windows users still get some preview version 1.9.4 at the moment. That doesn&#x27;t look to me as if Windows was a first-class citizen in git.<p>Fun fact: Converting from git to mercurial is the easiest thing in the world (`hg convert my-git-repo new-hg-repo`), but the other way around is weird and complicated to setup (talking about hg-git).",1418375672

8739153,comment,8738939,8738939,0,0,jokoon,,,"I think what people seems to not understand about neuron networks is the memory locality. Neurons pass messages directly between each other, so they always retain their own memory state, which is very different from a CPU or a GPU. CPU and GPU have a shared memory architecture, and thus memory access is generally slower overall, because of how they are designed for programming simplicity. Don&#x27;t ever forget that computer speed is never about calculation, but always about memory access. A computer speed is always limited by its L1 and L2 cache size.<p>If you want to draw one image, GPUs are fine, but they are not really able to simulate neuron networks because they don&#x27;t have as much parallelism or memory locality a neuron network needs. GPU are more parallized than a CPU, yes, thanks to OpenCL. But they&#x27;re still specialized towards image blitting, not towards massively parallelism.<p>Neuron networks are not very hard to understand, but if you think about simulating one, you quickly understand that most hardware is just not adequate and unable to run a neuron network properly, it will be just too slow. Computers were never designed and intended to simulate something like a brain.<p>Also don&#x27;t forget most algorithm we use today are not parallelizable, most are sequential. We could rethink many algorithms and adapt them, but parallelism is often a huge constraint. Sequentiality is a specialized case of computability if you think about it.",1418375321

I can&#x27;t respond to you and your post is grey.<p>I wrote the OO game in C++, but I avoided multiple inheritance, because there were warnings everywhere: &quot;don&#x27;t use multiple inheritance&quot;. And I don&#x27;t think it would be much help in the end.<p>Another thing inheritance doesn&#x27;t solve - when you want to choose which logic should run on your &quot;object&quot; depending on dynamic conditions.<p>For example I had ParticleEffect abstract class, Smoke and Fire derived from it. Fire reacted differently to collisions with stuff, than smoke. Fire partices were smaller with each frame to simulate flames, smoke was getting bigger and more transparent with each frame to simulate, well, smoke.<p>Then I wanted to make fire that turns into smoke after a couple of frames.<p>Solution 1 - merge both classes, make enum field inside, switch it after a couple of frames [not OO design - behaviour depends on fields not on classes]<p>Solution 2 - destroy fire object after a couple of frames and create new smoke object in its place [unnessesary allocation and deallocation is bad in games, also this complicates identity - for fire and smoke it doesn&#x27;t matter, but for player and bullets it&#x27;s important - I need to ensure player isn&#x27;t hit by bullets he shoot, that&#x27;s achieved by keeping &quot;parent&quot; pointer in each object, when the player is recreated because he got new behaviour - all the pointers are wrong and need to be updated].<p>I can&#x27;t change class of object dynamicaly, so all the OO divisions are static in time, I have to workaround class hierarchy to model my problem correctly.<p>Another thing - in collision detection, the logic to run should depend on both colliding objects types, and some of their fields. With OO I have to workaround this again (because most OO languages are single-dispatch).<p>Another thing - OO data is much harder to serialize. Structural data allows banal serialization. This is solved in some languages (like Python or Java) by providing serialization in the core language, but in C++ or javascript serializing arbitrary object graph correctly is nontrivial. Serializing list of records was trivial even in Turbo Pascal ;)",1418375111

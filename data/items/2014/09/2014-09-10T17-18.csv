8297875,comment,8296567,8296567,12,0,JanSolo,,,"If I were NASA, I&#x27;d pick SpaceX and Sierra Nevada and here&#x27;s why:<p>Boeing CST100 is the most conventional of all the 3 designs. It&#x27;s probably the &#x27;safest&#x27; bet but also the most expensive to operate. This is because it still requires an Atlas or Delta rocket to launch. Atlas is likely out because its russian-sourced motors are currently out of fashion. That leaves Delta; which is the most expensive of the currently available launchers. Also, CST100 uses a traditional &#x27;SplashDown&#x27; recovery that requires a flotilla of helicopter-capable naval ships to be on standby for every mission. This is not cheap.\nThat said, I&#x27;m sure it will work as-designed and will be fairly reliable. But all this comes at a cost; and IMO if NASA are smart, they can get more functionality for less money from the other providers.<p>Lets see: SpaceX has the advantage of using their own launchers. These were already much cheaper than Atlas and Delta, but soon we&#x27;re promised that they&#x27;ll be reusable. This can slash the cost by a further factor of 10 again. Such possibilities are hard to ignore. \nFurthermore, the Dragon2 capsule does not require a naval recovery and can land on a simple slab of concrete anywhere you&#x27;d like. \nThere are other fringe benefits too... Dragon2 is re-usable, you could potentially just refuel it, put it back on another rocket and launch it again within a few days.\nAlso, Dragon2 uses a novel pusher-type launch-escape-system that&#x27;s integrated into the capsule instead of being jettissoned on each launch. These things add up to considerable savings.\nNASA would be foolish not to choose SpaceX as one of their 2 choices... Price-wise, SpaceX is probably the cheapest of the 3, however the risks are fairly high; there&#x27;s a lot of new tech that needs to be proven. But the potential rewards are so high and SpaceX&#x27;s track-record of acheiving their promises is so stellar, that NASA surely must give them a shot.<p>That leaves SierraNevada. They&#x27;re kinda the wildcard in this competition. They have this wacky spaceplane that looks like it came from the 60s. If you ask any astronauts which one they&#x27;d pick, I bet they&#x27;d all say SierraNevada. Why? Astronauts are often test-pilots. Test pilots like to fly things. This is the only one that can be &#x27;piloted&#x27; in the traditional sense of the word (with wings and surfaces). \nIt has several advantages: Easy and fast recovery; just land on any runway. Reusability; no need to build a new one each time. Pusher-style LES. Also, it just looks plain cool.\nAnd it has one big disadvantage: It&#x27;s designed to launch on the currently-unfashionable AtlasV rocket. \nIf SierraNevada can convert this thing to launch on a Delta or a Falcon, I think they&#x27;ll have a good enough price advantage over CST100 to make them the 2nd-choice after SpaceX.<p>Having said all this... space hardware gets built on the whims of politicians. Even with the best planning, there&#x27;s still a good chance that some politician will point at the pork-barrel and fuck it all up.",1410371249

Given the way population tends to accumulate over time, you only need to convince 15% of those women who have already given birth to have 1 extra child, to raise Germany&#x27;s birth rate back up to the replacement level. The question then is, are there those families who might like to have another child, if the cost was less of a burden? To borrow a phrase from economics, such policies seek to influence those families &quot;at the margin&quot;, that is, those families that are considering having another child, and for whom some extra subsidy might be exactly what is needed to influence their decision in a positive direction. As in sales, there is no need to go after those who would never buy your product. There is no need to go after those women who are happy to be childless. The focus of pro-natalist policies is always to influence those who are open to the idea and who can be persuaded with some form of help.",1410370654

For one quick example, Erlang requires you to terminate statements with either a comma, or a period, depending on whether it&#x27;s the last statement in the section.  If you move code around, you need to go back at the end and fix the commas and periods.  Typically, this happens in the form of an error message, which leads to a tedious extra step that happens to me maybe 15 times a day when working with Erlang.  That problem doesn&#x27;t exist in Elixir.  There are quite a few other nice things too.  Elixir increases productivity in real ways.",1410370206

But are they more likely to be good salesmen? People with low intelligence or impulse inhibition tend to end up in prison, but are they effective criminals?<p>This is an exciting first step - by gathering quantitative data about the roles that the candidates go into, and how they perform, you could build the model you need. You probably don&#x27;t have it yet though.<p>The other important thing is that different types of sales require very different people.<p>Sometimes, sales people need to penetrate a market where contacts are important, and deals are huge but take a long time to set up. They need to be the kind of person who can foster long term relationships, and maintain long term personal relationships with people and organizations.<p>Other times, deals are small, or relatively small, and what is important is volume. Maybe they need to rapidly create a shallow relationship, close the sale, and walk away. Maybe they need to cold call, and be especially tenacious in the face of rejection.<p>I&#x27;d be fascinated to see you create a questionnaire or similar that identifies the right person for that specific role.<p>What about administrating the tests to current employees, along with details from their bosses about performance.

Early last summer I took a fairly deep dive into Elixir and discovered that it left me with the same feelings as when I started to explore Ruby at the suggestion of my then boss many years ago. It just made sense. From the structure of an application to the way pattern matching works and even the larger ecosystem. I know a lot of people compare Ruby and Elixir because of the superficial syntactical similarities but there&#x27;s something deeper there that makes me almost giddy: once you know the basics a lot of the rest just sort of seems to fall into place. Unlike a lot of other languages the learning process isn&#x27;t filled with head-tilting moments of confusion, just lots of nodding up and down while thinking &quot;Of course that&#x27;s how it works!&quot;",1410370024

[1]  But the watch demo was oddly fixated on long interactions (the most difficult way to text emoji to date) and stupid interactions (browsing pictures on a 1&quot; screen?).<p>The cases where watch-interaction makes <i>more</i> (or primary) sense [2] were given very little screen time, or mere lip service.  And, oddly enough, those cases seem to have been given <i>more</i> thought and have more obvious, natural, direct, and thus <i>better</i> interactions [3].<p><i>Enabling</i> those complex interactions, that are <i>going</i> to be inefficient and annoying, is <i>going</i> to lead to an avalanche of apps that similarly invite users to do things fundamentally ill-suited to a watch. Poorly conceived apps, lazily-ported apps -- The ecosystem as a whole is going to suffer for having that around. [4]<p>And then there&#x27;s the interaction methods.  iOS was a boon for computer use because it&#x27;s so obvious, direct and natural.  Many/most people never really got the hang of click vs double-click vs right-click.  Many struggled with the core indirection of pushing the pointer around the screen with their mouse and the whole &quot;scroll down to push the page up&quot; mess (that only makes sense if you grew up on keyboard-only interaction and the also-awkwardly-named &quot;page up&quot;/down keys).<p>Apple sweated the details, stripped away the distractions and non-essentials, and they nailed it.<p>But what does the watch bring?  Quick-tap vs long-tap vs force-tap?  Are they <i>kidding</i>?  Undiscoverable hidden interaction zones in corner(s?) or off-screen-swipes to execute features with no articulated conceptual logic as to &quot;what goes where&quot; or how the (in)existence of those features is even <i>conveyed</i>?  Those demo controls showed more arcane gestures than a Harry Potter movie.<p>And the crown?  It zooms the screen, except when it doesn&#x27;t.  It scrolls lists, except when it doesn&#x27;t.  It manipulates input controls, except when it doesn&#x27;t -- and only if you apply the appropriate tap to successfully shift focus to the desired input. This is a mode-switching UX nightmare.<p>Stated plainly -- that watch, that demo? -- <i>they blew it</i>.<p>They&#x27;ve got a few months where they <i>could</i> course-correct.  They&#x27;ve got a review step where they <i>could</i> filter out &quot;bad&quot; apps to protect the ecosystem from what they accidentally enabled (and <i>encouraged</i> by focusing the demo on it).<p>But I am not optimistic that a group who could green-light that demo is capable of discerning the difference.  I think Apple&#x27;s fundamental &quot;taste&quot; is in question. [5]<p>[1] Jobs famously stated &quot;if you see a stylus, they blew it.&quot;  The key here is that &quot;blew it&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;they made a bad tablet&quot;.  It means &quot;they never understood <i>mobile</i> or <i>touch</i>.&quot;  They never understood that the use cases and ergonomics require a fundamental re-thinking of interaction. They never understood that you can&#x27;t just port over things that worked somewhere else and only make sense given prior experience with something else.<p>[2] e.g. when the phone itself is less accessible (while exercising, while in-bed, while hands are collecting purchased items), thus giving you longer than 2 seconds before the &quot;I might as well have pulled out my phone&quot; moment.
e.g. when direct use of the phone would defeat the feature (to use the watch as remote viewfinder/shutter release for the phone&#x27;s camera).<p>[3] notification triage; workout/stopwatch/timer start/stop; simple location-based interactions like payments, unlocking a hotel room door, etc. It all looked far more sane/natural/straightforward.<p>[4] We all just saw what happened with Microsoft&#x27;s odd mode-shifting app circus on their Surface tablets. If you enable the &quot;conceptually new, thus more difficult, but right&quot; interaction method <i>and</i> &quot;conceptually familiar, thus easier, and wrong&quot; interaction method, how many devs are <i>really</i> going to put in the work to get it right?  Recent experience suggests enough devs will take shortcuts that your users will become frustrated and your ecosystem stained.<p>[5]  I don&#x27;t think Apple&#x27;s taste is <i>definitely gone</i>.  But the notion that Apple might be &quot;coasting on momentum&quot; is no longer something I can laugh off.  Not on a core <i>design</i> level.<p>And an alternative explanation to &quot;they&#x27;re coasting&quot; on momentum, is that the Watch is pushing iphone/ipad interactions where they don&#x27;t belong because Apple&#x27;s <i>captured</i> by their own momentum.  And that&#x27;s far, far worse.",1410369338

But here are a few specific tips that I believe significantly improved my programming ability:<p>1) Try to get the implementation 100% correct on the first try. I don&#x27;t mean that you should implement the whole system in one go, but the part you implement should do exactly what you want it to do (i.e. no typos, mixed up variable names, etc.). At first I thought this was a bit harsh, but it was amazing how much debugging you can avoid with a little more focus in the beginning. Also, it forces you to adopt good coding practices and make sure your algorithms are fully specified.<p>2) Don&#x27;t tolerate tedious work. If there&#x27;s any part of your workflow that&#x27;s tedious, spend a lot of effort trying to minimize it. Some examples of things you might do: write a script, refactor your code, use a better editor, use a different programming language. You won&#x27;t learn much from changing 100 variable names to camel-case, other than how painful it is. You will learn something from writing a tool to help you do that.<p>3) Think about how various libraries and frameworks you use are implemented, especially if they have features that seem like &quot;magic&quot;. Try to reverse-engineer their design, or take a look at their source code (if available). This is a natural way to gain exposure to new ideas.<p>Regarding more &quot;theoretical&quot; subjects like algorithms and data structures that you might need to know for interviews, you could practice on programming contest websites (e.g. www.codeforces.com) or read some textbooks. However, in my opinion, those are not nearly as important for a software developer as the three things mentioned above.",1410369237

Whenever people are faced with 2 problems, they need to make a decision about which problem is more urgent. If you honestly feel that problem B is more important than problem A, then you have a good reason to allow A to become worse so as to do something about B.<p>I could make an analogy to heart disease: aspirin can help lower the risk of a heart attack, but it has a risk itself: internal bleeding. Is aspirin worth the risk? That is something to be decided by a doctor and the patient. One needs to carefully weigh the risks of both decisions. One needs to examine all of the circumstances. However, where the risk of heart attack is serious, then the medical establishment is in agreement that it is better to take aspirin than to run the risk of a heart attack.<p>Exactly the same reasoning should apply to Germany and the issue of population. Which issue is more pressing, the issue of national debt, or the issue of declining population? One can make an argument either way, however Germany has a level of debt that is better than France, Italy, and many other European nations:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_public_debt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_public_deb...</a><p>More so, Germany&#x27;s public debt is less of an issue than it seems because the public is itself not highly indebted (as opposed to the public in the USA, which carries immense private sector debts).<p>If you project Germany&#x27;s debts 50 years in the future, the situation seems bleak, because of rising retirement costs -- but that problem exists exactly because of the low birth rate, so if it was possible to solve the low birth rate, then the debts in 50 years would cease to be a problem.<p>The reality is, Germany has the financial resources to take some action against the low birth rate, if it wanted to. While there are important issues to be discussed, both pro and con, the financial arguments tend to be fake arguments.<p>Germany is restrained in its actions because of the continuing cultural force of &quot;Kinder, Küche, Kirche&quot;. Aggressive action to raise the birth rate would automatically mean a change in the private sphere of life. More so, it would likely mean a revolution in the social status of women, and there are many in Germany who are wary of changes in gender relations.<p>Between the years 1874 and 1899 my great grandmother gave birth to 16 children. My family lived on a farm in what was then the Austro-Hungarian Empire. At that time, children as young as 5 were used for farmwork. A child as young as 12 could bring in a surplus -- they were, in a sense, &quot;profit centers&quot;. Over the last 150 years children have transformed from units of production to units of consumption. Raising a child is now very expensive, and it is against the law for children to do any work that might offset their cost. Because of that, people have cut back on the number of children they have. Whereas my great grandmother had 16 children, most of my friends are content to have 1 or 2 children. Nowadays, having 3 children seems like a large family.<p>If Germany were serious about lifting the birth rate, it could take aggressive action to mitigate the costs of raising children. I am sure each of us can imagine some program that we think might work: free day care for children of all ages, or a huge bonus at birth such as $100,000, or some method of feeding children such that food is effectively free for children, and parents are saved the cost.<p>The important thing is to imagine what aggressive action would really look like. It would make some people flinch: their instinct would be that whatever program you suggest, the program is &quot;too expensive&quot;. But, to repeat the point I made above, the financial arguments are nonsense. If you believe that Germany faces crushing debts in the future because of rising retirement costs, then raising the birth rate is the solution to Germany&#x27;s financial problems.<p>But if you believe that the money simply doesn&#x27;t exist, and that we are, in 2014, unable to do what my great grandmother did in the late 1800s, then the entire narrative of the Industrial Revolution needs to be re-examined, because you are suggesting that we are all poorer now than we were 120-140 years ago. Ask yourself, do you honestly believe that today&#x27;s technology has left us poorer? Most economic historians would argue that, even with the reduction of child labor, most families are better off today than they were 120-140 years ago. If you assume that more per-capita wealth exists in the world now than circa 1880, then it should be possible to pay families for the cost of raising 3 or 4 children.",1410368856

You can trivially detect a large set of terms that are semantically identical; and all the rest - possibly identical and possibly not identical - can be left alone. &quot;i = i+1;&quot; <=> &quot;i++;&quot; and such.<p>In particular, &quot;syntactic sugar&quot; explicitly refers to substitutions that can be (and are) made by considering only the local scope, and the rest of the program can&#x27;t change the validity of this substitution; in the cases for syntactic [de]sugaring all the changes can be performed safely by looking at a statement or two (or their AST representations) in complete isolation.<p>If you have two functions that happen to be semantically equal but differ in other things than pure sugar - well, then they won&#x27;t be affected by desugaring or sugaring, obiously, and we don&#x27;t need to detect if they&#x27;re actually equal or not.<p>Translating from source code to AST is clear and unambiguous and doesn&#x27;t require anything related to the halting problem.<p>Translating from AST to some canonical representation of source code can also be done - it&#x27;s not trivial, but if you have the original code, then you can get a better result than the current decompilers do.<p>This will result in cases where transforming back and forth will cause\n  A => A&#x27; => A\nand\n  B => A&#x27; => A\nwhich is the intended result.",1410368614

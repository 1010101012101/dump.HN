Furthermore, >99.5% of Didi&#x27;s current rides are for Chinese passengers, and very few of their drivers speak English.<p>This isn&#x27;t just a problem for Lyft/Didi.  I have used Uber 18 times in the past week, exclusively in China.  On all 18 occasions, I received a phone call from the driver within 100 seconds of allocation.  They asked me to confirm my current location, and my destination.  I did this in Chinese.  2 or 3 of the drivers had passable English.  The other drivers would have failed to communicate with a non-Chinese-speaking visitor from the US.<p>Uber is experimenting with solving this by adding an additional &#x27;English&#x27; service next to the existing UberX, People&#x27;s Uber etc.  But they don&#x27;t have many drivers who can speak English, so the quoted wait times for that service are something like 5x the wait time for People&#x27;s Uber.<p>Didi isn&#x27;t as reliant on foreigners for growth, so what is their incentive to attract English-speaking drivers who can adequately serve Lyft customers?",1442476709

10232131,comment,10225903,10231356,0,0,comex,,,"I was curious what the actual state was of the &quot;modern Linux kernel&quot; pcwalton mentioned, so I tried running a test program to create a million threads on a VM - x86-64 with 8GB of RAM, Linux 4.0.  For comparison, Go apparently uses about 4KB per goroutine, so it should be possible to create somewhat under 2 million goroutines.  To be fair, I allocated the stacks manually in one large allocation; otherwise it dies quite quickly running out of VM mappings.  I set the stack size to the pthread minimum of 16KB (actually, I tried cheating and making it smaller, but it crashed, so I gave up - not a good idea anyway).  The threads waited for an indication from the main thread, sent after thread creation was done, to exit; in an attempt to avoid the overhead associated with pthread conditions, I just used futex directly:<p><pre><code>    while (!ready)\n        assert(!syscall(SYS_futex, &ready, FUTEX_WAIT, 0, NULL, NULL, 0));\n\n</code></pre>\nThe program caused the kernel to hit OOM (rather ungracefully!) somewhere around 270,000 threads.  To see how long it took while ensuring all the threads actually ran, I reduced the thread count to 200,000, had it join all the threads at the end, and timed this whole process: after the first run it took about 4 seconds.  (The first run was considerably slower, but that isn&#x27;t a big deal for a server, which is the most important use case for having such a large number of goroutines/threads.)  Therefore, the C version uses about 20 microseconds and 32 KB of memory per thread.<p>For completeness, I also tested a similar Go program on Go 1.4 (the version available from Debian on the VM); it actually got up to 3,150,000 before OOM, and took 9 seconds to do 2 million - 4.5 microseconds and 2.7KB per thread.<p>In other words, Linux is about an order of magnitude slower at managing a lrge number of threads.  That looks pretty bad, but on the other hand, it&#x27;s not that much in absolute terms!  I&#x27;m pretty sure most server programs don&#x27;t need more than 250,000 simultaneous connections (or can afford to spend more than 8GB of RAM on them) and don&#x27;t mind spending an extra 20 microseconds to initiate a connection, so if operating systems other than Linux aren&#x27;t a concern, they could be written to create a thread per connection without too much trouble.  It&#x27;s not going to give you the absolute maximum performance (meaning it&#x27;s not appropriate for a decent class of program - then again, I suspect Go isn&#x27;t either), but it&#x27;s not terrible either.<p>I&#x27;d like to see it improve.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if there is (still) some low hanging fruit; do kernel developers actually care about this use case?<p>(And yes, I know this doesn&#x27;t really test performance of the scheduler during sustained operation.  That&#x27;s its own can of worms.)",1442476344

Although perhaps with current hw and Linux being able to decently handle quite a lot of threads since NPTL, one should nowadays call it the C100K problem?<p>What has changed is a change in focus. Few people do entirely static sites anymore, and for static assets (images etc.) everybody uses nginx or other nonblocking approaches anyway. Perhaps also nginx/etc. as a reverse proxy. So there is no argument that nonblocking approaches are better for handling a lot of potentially slow connections.<p>But for the &quot;core&quot; functionality of a network application, that people are actually spending times programming rather than using an off the shelf solution like nginx, nonblocking vs. threads doesn&#x27;t matter <i>that</i> much, there&#x27;s all kinds of DB calls, CPU intensive work to do, etc. So people are (correctly) asking whether we can create nonblocking code but with an easier to use programming model (to the extent it does matter for performance) or whether to just use threads.",1442476050

Yes, as I just said, that&#x27;s essentially libcore.<p>It doesn&#x27;t literally offer working dynamic allocations, but I don&#x27;t see how a cross-platform and cross-use-case freestanding library can do that, too many different environments/constraints to encode an built-in allocator. In fact, core says nothing about how allocation has to work or even if it needs to exist.<p>The rustc distribution has the additional `alloc` and `collections` crates layered on top of `core`, which offers some extra functionality when allocation does exist (without assuming other OS support, like IO), and the allocator used is pluggable.<p>(Do you have an example of a standards complaint C++ freestanding standard library?)<p>2. There will be some way to do this long term. I can offer no guarantees that it will be what&#x27;s there right now, but something will exist. This is also something that has been on the radar for a long time, but isn&#x27;t core to the language. In any case, what is in core is essentially just optimising stack usage, all of the sematics it offers can be done with normal function calls, e.g. `Box::new` is literally just a normal function and perfectly implementable in any environment, if you have some allocation routine (the compiler/language doesn&#x27;t need to know about either). So the unstable libcore functionality is important and desirable, but not killer.<p>There&#x27;s also the meaning of &quot;allocators&quot; as in allowing `Vec` (etc.) to use some other algorithm than what Rust does by default; again something desirable and been on the radar for a while, but not key to the language.

Apart from minor crisis (Balkans, or 1998 crack in Russia), tensions were appeasing. On September 11, five places in US were hit by simultaneous terrorist attacks, the most famous being NYC with over 3000 deaths. The blame was immediately put on Bin Laden, who was searched for 10 years until his capture in 2011, and globally on Arabic people. USA raised CIA budgets, sent its army to Irak, Afghanistan and Pakistan, created illegal prisons, used torture against what was later proven to be civilians, sprung unprecendented measures for security. In the middle east, the recovery from the Cold War was replaced by a constant storm of missile strikes. Military started using automated robots such as the Predator, spreading a worldwide solidarity among arabic people. In the USA, impacts were high on civilians. In airports, people were arrested for not being able to explain where they were going, military tanks started being used in USA police stations, military methods were used to bust poker parties, killing hundreds of Americans per year, and NSA was in charge of establishing a permanent control on all private communications. In 15 years the most powerful country of the world became able to squash any interior political movement with military methods. Worst of all, a poll showed that 40% of the population believed that September 11 was an attack organized by the CIA to renew the nationalist sentiment.&quot;<p>> It&#x27;ll be relegated to the history books possibly to be replaced with bigger issues that happen later.<p>Maybe not, if it&#x27;s the root explanation of said later events.",1442475213

This is because, on Unix, the APIs for network I/O are &quot;readiness&quot;-based (they tell you when data is available in the read buffer or space is available in the write buffer), but a disk file handle is always ready (except at EOF). So, for disk I/O you need a &quot;completion&quot; model, where you queue an operation and then get a callback when it is done. This is a very different kind of API, and as a result it does not fit well with the network I/O APIs, but of course if you are doing async you probably need to do <i>both</i> disk and network at the same time, so you need the APIs to play nice with each other (you need a single event loop that waits for both kinds of events).<p>(On Windows, as I understand it, you can do completion-based I/O on all handle types.)<p>And then, even if you manage to use async disk I/O, you can only really use it for reads and writes. Filesystem calls that manipulate the directory tree usually don&#x27;t have async versions. At some point you have to give up and do things in threads.",1442475012

So 5 is 1-2-1-2-3 1-2-1-2-3 or 1-2-3-1-2 1-2-3-1-2.  There is one Middle Eastern 9/8 rhythm which is 1-2-1-2-1-2-1-2-3.

One is one.  You just have to remember how many beats there are this time around.<p>I think this comes from the way humans walk.  Since we are bipedal, we naturally fall into gaits with 2 or 3 beats.  (Skipping is based on 3.  Waltz step is another one based on 3.

The calculus is really very simple.<p>I've seen this pattern happen a number of times, and the usual result is that these new managers show up, make poor decisions (because they don't understand the business) cycle out (taking their stock with them), repeat 4-5 times until a manager shows up who is so inoffensive that the remaining engineers simply end up running the show in the end anyways and the manager just shows up to weekly meetings so she/he can liaise with corporate.<p>In the meantime, the company stock has diluted as it fled out the door to the past managers, the company lost most of its senior engineering staff, forcing them to promote lower level, less capable staff to senior positions or to hire externally (again people who don't understand the business further exacerbating the vicious cycle).",1261412652

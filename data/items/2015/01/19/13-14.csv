The problem is, no matter how hard the engineer tries, he can never anticipate the unknowns to the extent that the application framework can support all of them.\nWe should go back to solving the specific problem at hand. In both scenarios you get the customer who wants a feature that absolutely doesn&#x27;t fit with the current application, therefore a rewrite is necessary. And with the specific solution, you don&#x27;t have nearly the man hours wasted.",1421675870

Machine ticks? Wall clock? Is it correct? Is it stable enough?<p>* What if the clock misses the time that I asked for? Do you run it anyway? Do you skip that invocation?<p>* What if the clock moves backwards? Will you trigger twice? Will you even notice?<p>* What if I have a leap second so there are 61 seconds in the hour? What if a second is removed so there are 59 seconds in the hour?<p>The reason why people don&#x27;t touch this stuff or get it wrong is because it&#x27;s really hard.

I personally find the issues unclear, as obviously to a degree as he suggests below, Youtube and other providers are in a similar position:<p>&quot;Well, of course everybody knows that the internet is being used for legitimate and illegitimate uses. I think every online service provider has the same challenges that we have. YouTube, Google, everybody is in the same boat. So what you need to understand here is that we provided the content owners with an opportunity to remove links that were infringing on their rights. So, not only did they have an online form where they could take down infringing links, they had direct delete access to our servers so they could access our system and remove any link that they would find anywhere on the internet without us being involved. They had full access and we’re talking about 180 partners, including every major movie studio, including Microsoft and all big content producers and they have used that system heavily and you need to understand that that system was not even something that was even required by the law. We provided that voluntarily and they have removed over 15 million links.&quot;<p>From: <a href=""http://www.3news.co.nz/tvshows/campbelllive/kim-dotcoms-first-tv-interview-im-no-piracy-king-2012030118#ixzz3PH3S7eWO"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.3news.co.nz/tvshows/campbelllive/kim-dotcoms-firs...</a>",1421674755

But sometimes you have a project that already is in JavaScript and where JavaScript mostly makes sense, but you have one or two task that are small but fairly CPU intensive.  Then knowing how to write fast JavaScript is a pretty good idea since JavaScript can be pretty fast these days and the overhead (both in terms of runtime and developer time) of calling out to second language isn&#x27;t always trivial and it&#x27;s nice if you can avoid it.<p>Secondly (and not entirely relevant to this) people are doing more and more &#x27;clever&#x27; CPU-intensive things client side these days where JavaScript is your only choice.

Someone starts talking on their phone anyway. Which theater would you respect more:<p>One that reiterates the request until the patron finishes their conversation, but takes no action.<p>One that kicks a patron out for breaking the rule, with 0 warnings.<p>It&#x27;s the second one, right? Because they enforce their boundaries. It&#x27;s the same way with people... I respect people more when they say they&#x27;re going to do something, and then they really do it.

Or, their North Korean hosts, knowing U.S. policy, were proactive in making up a bill.<p>Either way, the NYT article should have mentioned the USG policy. If they can&#x27;t get that little thing right, it makes me wonder about the accuracy of the rest of the article.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title5/html/USCODE-2010-title5-partIII-subpartF-chap73.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title5/html/USCODE-...</a>",1421672663

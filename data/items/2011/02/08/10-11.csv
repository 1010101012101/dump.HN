What numbers would you get if you split Samsung and Nokia's smartphone business from their massive dumbphone businesses? Apparently <i>that</i> number isn't interesting.<p>Why don't we throw in Apple's lower-priced, lower-margin iPod nanos and shuffles and see if we can guess what kind of entirely unexpected, magical effect that might have on their profit per device? (Not that being in that business is any way bad for Apple, nor are they harmed by the profit or name recognition it generates.)<p>As for Mr Dilger's contention about Android vendors struggling: most folk seem to agree that Android saved Motorola. They may not be doing very well, but the fact that they are doing anything is an improvement.<p>ZTE and Huwai are two big winners (triple digit growth) from Android that he doesn't mention. They're big telecom firms more famous for being OEMs but they're getting into the branded smartphone game thanks to Android. (Oh and the growth figures often don't count the carrier branded Android handsets they also produce). They may be no-names now but so was HTC a few years ago, yet last year they won both smartphone of the year and tech brand of the year in the UK (again very much thanks to Android), two awards you would expect Apple to be walking away with.<p>Samsung are doing fine in smartphones. In the last 6 months they've overtaken  HTC in sales, with devices of the same or higher calibre and price, and the advantage that the components are all Samsung made too.<p>Who does that leave? Sony Ericsson who say they were surprised by the high level of competition from other Android vendors and vow to up their game in response.

I fully understand and agree.<p>I think that in the US, there are some parallels in the hosting industry to what happened to ISPs a decade ago; the small guys are giving way to big players in the market. The biggest slices of the pie are just getting bigger while the remaining crumbs are few and far between.<p>For the small guys, there's a race to the bottom in pricing and most times this is at the expense of quality... There's really no other way to easily differentiate yourself from the other guys.<p>But there are important differences between the hosting industry and the mom & pop ISPs of yore, the big one being the target market. Having name recognition works to get the undiscerning, but the average VPS user is more knowledgable about the product they are getting. And the product itself is much more complex; the needs of any two businesses are quite different.<p>This presents opportunities. And the popularity and ultimate acquisition of the ISP Speakeasy by Best Buy shows that building a loyal base of knowledgable customers can pay big dividends.<p>Things have been pretty well saturated for a long, long time and there's still a niche market in the US for good quality hosting companies that care about the individuals they serve. (Although that niche becomes smaller as the big guys' quality, cost and ease-of-use improves year after year.)<p>Ultimately, hosting just isn't a business that can go viral. There's just too many physical limitations. It is lucrative and I think it can be a good long-play, but it's dependent on getting and keeping a relatively small critical mass and keeping those customers happy.<p>I really appreciate your feedback and honesty. Solving the difference problem itself is really the innovation in this business; there's not really many ways to distinguish yourself as a hosting provider, so how do you do it?",1297159557

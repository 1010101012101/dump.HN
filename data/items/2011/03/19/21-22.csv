I've done this several times, I have a support/ticketing system that I wrote (in perl) ~8 years ago that I've adapted to 3 different companies now.<p>My personal findings in dealing with support queue management efficiencies are more about tailoring the support system to the business.  The process you follow for creating a ticket, assigning a ticket, and gathering relevant data can be very different among two companies that have a similar SaaS approach, for example.  So, I have a base framework that can read and respond to emails that I adapt to the particular use case.<p>My system has implemented some of the things you mention though.  The ""reply 3"" concept is a knowledge base of common issues that a tech can look up a KB item, enter an email address of the customer, and the system will send a message to that address with an intro along the lines of ""Alice thought you might find the following knowledge base article helpful with your issue.  If this solves the problem, no response is necessary.  If this does not prove helpful just reply to this email and we will reassign the ticket.""",1300571102

2344814,comment,2343776,2343776,0,0,sethco,,,"I'm not going to comment on whether you should try to fix things at your current company but I have some good perspective on the job market and some of the options that you are looking at so I will comment on those things (both from your original question and in some of the comments)<p>I just finished a job search focusing on medium size companies (specifically I was looking for funded, growing startups with say 20 < total staff < 200). I have a good network and got some great leads and had three great offers in hand after a one month search process. I don't say that to boast, just to point out that there are lots of opportunities out there. Everything that I saw and heard in the process confirmed that this is a great market for a developer looking for a job. Several other people whom I know were looking at the same time and all have accepted or are close to accepting new positions. For more confirmation look at Fred Wilson's post today, it even links to the USV jobs board: <a href=""http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/03/the-war-for-talent.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/03/the-war-for-talent.html</a><p>Unless there is something specific that you are looking for in a large company (and it sounds like there isn't particularly) then maybe you should be looking at funded startups as well? This can be a great option: the company is funded so you probably don't have to worry about getting paid this month or next month (although that concern may come sooner or later, keep alert!); they are small and hopefully growing so you still get to wear lots of hats and can have a large say in defining your role and can still see your personal impact on the company's future; they won't have the bureaucracy or organizational overhead of a large co; lots more too. True you won't have as large a stake as you have now but 0.001% of something valuable is better than 25% of nothing!<p>As to finding a job, in my experience getting in through a recruiter is the hardest way and least likely to succeed. Having your resume submitted by someone in the company or finding a founder here on HN or whatever other inside track you can find is much more useful. Now that I think about it, I realize that in 16 years in the industry I have never once gotten a job through a recruiter (that isn't entirely true, my first contract position went through a recruiter but they were given my resume by someone at the company that was hiring contractors). Every time except that first one I started the conversation with the person or people who would be making the hire/no-hire decision and going back to recruiting to setup the interview loop, etc. was just a formality.<p>So fire up your network (and if you don't have a good one then start building one! Go to startup events, Python tech talks, whatever excites you). Start looking for opportunities, talk to people, maybe go on some interviews to see what is out there and to see how you do.<p>In one of the comments you express concern about your age, ""near 30 and haven't broken out yet"". Well, I say don't worry so much about that. I was 27 when I got my first computer industry job as a contract Software Test Engineer at Microsoft; I am 42 now and doing very well in Senior Engineer/Architect level positions. Don't be fooled by the myth that you have to make it by 25 or whatever.<p>Your resume may be a bit thin, that is a concern but remember that everyone started with a blank resume. You need to figure out how to explain your accomplishments over the past three years that doesn't focus on not shipping and does focus on what _you_ did do.<p>Don't worry too much about being a job hopper at this point; three years is a long time at one job and squarely within the normal range. If I saw someone with a string of <2 year jobs or a couple of 6 month jobs I would ask about it, and there could be a reasonable explanation, but 3 year jobs? No worries there.<p>One very good piece of advice that I got as I started my search: you only get to pick a new job half a dozen or at the most a dozen times in your career so pick good jobs!",1300570882

I primarily use it for browsing the web and programming (I like the *nix environment).  That's basically it.<p>I run GNOME with the Courier font in terminal and the black-white system color theme.  It looks sleek and has improved since I did my first install.<p>When Update Manager runs, I see a ton of things to update some times without a clue of what depends on them.  The UI could have some sort of small text under the dependency that says something like ""used by app1, app2, and N others.""<p>Also, it seems like when I authenticate for an update to occur the prompt to authenticate just sits there.  I have to close it manually after clicking the ""Authenticate"" button to actually watch my updates stream in.  That didn't use to happen.<p>Perhaps the update process could suggest removals.

In this case, you can apologize and indicate you wish you could keep them.  Do not in any way mention that behavior issues were at all a concern.  If counsel indicates this is important, than do it as a business move to stay out of court and let everyone know that it sucks, but you have no real choice.  Then let folks know you look forward to having them back at age 16.<p>Alternately, look more closely into state-by-state laws and put out rules that indicate that age of entry varies by state.  Enforce by IP address or something else reasonable along those lines.  This might allow you to keep more members that you would like to keep and do less damage to the site culture but there is a significantly larger cost involved in terms of determining state exceptions, enforcing the rules, etc.  If you can bear the cost, this might be a good option.  If you cannot bear the cost, do an across-the-board thing for all states based on what counsel tells you.<p>Since this question came up due to behavior concerns, revisit that issue separately.  It won't magically disappear just because all the underage accounts were removed.  Banning should be a last resort. Try hard to find other means to deal with this first.  When it does come time to ban someone, I recommend public bannings which state the cause of the banning.  This helps create an atmosphere of ""rule of law"" and helps encourage members who do want to stay to behave properly without being scared to death they will do the wrong thing.  Secret bannings are a good way to scare the hell out of your members and cause them to walk on eggshells, which is generally not conducive to creating a healthy site culture. It also does not provide any closure when someone bad is finally removed.  Public bannings allow remaining members to breathe a sigh of relief and feel safer once they know the troublemaker is gone.<p>Good luck with this.",1300570542

He is trying to show how to think and consider, that there is an ever escalating level of depth that must be considered that we take for granted and that learning how to ask the right question and introspect is key. Asking the right question is harder than getting the right answer. For a similar example, it is like asking how to use an array for something when what you really want is a hashtable or why this linear approximation is not working for the non linear data. You cannot answer the person without first explaining why what they are asking is not meaningful and cannot be answered until they first understand concept X.<p>The answer he gave was beyond amazing, there is an immense amount of knowledge there and I learned more from it than just physics. Just like that he gave a whirlwind tour that covered hundreds of years of physics, covering concepts from gravitation and Newton's Law to quantum field theory and does drop hints as to why magnets repel in multiple ways (electromagnetic forces everywhere - normal force and why you don't fall through floor are related - but effect stronger in magnetized iron since electrons aligned to spin in same direction).<p>And that is what separates someone like Feynman from most scientist. He is aware. He doesn't just regurgitate some encyclopaedic definition that is true but ultimately unenlightening, nor does he give a broken analogy when a good one cannot be given. Instead he leaves you with just the right questions in mind. He weaves an interesting story with a background and motivation and ties things up neatly in a way that you end up learning much more than what you asked for and leave with a deeper insight about everything in general and wanting more.

2344731,comment,2343296,2343296,0,0,RomanH,,,"There seems to be an unsatisfactory gray area between slack technology and misguided editorial practice (assuming better guidelines help create more substantial/enjoyable journalism).<p>With adequate tools for making the sourcing process as effortless as possible (see Jeremy Ashkenas' and Scott Klein's comments) it ought to remain an optional value-add for publishers: those who don't mind having their sourcing restricted to press releases, effort-obscuring generalizations or PR-driven 3rd party referencing won't encourage technologies that would enable their newsrooms leverage their in-house professionalism, regardless of its potential.<p>Linking/referencing is fundamental to good, original content, whatever the medium (see randlet's comment). If publishing software won't support easy source accreditation (particularly in a web-focused, hyper-linking context), journalists and editors are going to lose out - either by facing a 'keep my job vs. best practices' drama or by becoming disillusioned with the chance of success their organization has in maximizing the credibility of the staff input going into evolving their brand itself.<p>Taking their access to low cost, more modern publishing tools as a given, perhaps in more dynamic/educational reporting environments they should exploit software with prompts - asking authors to confirm that their content is 100% lacking of any derivative work, sources, or any mere cursory reference to any other material/commentary out there. This might even help less experienced journalists off-set some of the responsibility they have in bringing new ideas to the attention of their demanding readers ('this is my article, but here's some source curation for you, while I get my story straight'). Of course software that assumes any kind of pedagogical role is just as likely to become demonized by journalists who resent tools for their antiquated inefficiency. There's a fine line.<p>Services like DocumentCloud are vital in all this. As ilamont points out, there are also practical hurdles to overcome: even if you have the technology and inclination towards sourcing best practices, if you're running an online publication there's still the knee-jerk reaction to want to obscure your primary source, in case it out-performs your own content and thereby undermines your credibility. That's a question of quality and self awareness, though. The credibility loop will eventually hit your property, one way or the other.",1300568889

It shows you how much money each person is pulling in for the company. If you aren't doing very well, you start getting manager meetings, and they sit you down and try to figure out why you aren't selling more.<p>The best explanation of this I've seen is in the work of W. Edwards Deming.  His Red Bead experiment demonstrates that in any system, there will be variation that is due to the system itself, and not due to the individual efforts of the staff themselves. Because of this, league tables and metrics randomly and arbitrarily punish people for performance variation that is out of their control.<p><a href=""http://www.redbead.com/what/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.redbead.com/what/</a><p>Deming even listed ""evaluation by performance"" as one of the seven deadly diseases afflicting the western economy.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming#Seven_Deadly_Diseases"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming#Seven_Deadly_...</a><p>On that basis, I find it strangely contradictory that a company with such ongoing quality efforts as Apple has produced a sales process absent of the disease of sales commission, yet still suffering the disease of Evaluation by Performance.<p>It's possible, however, that Apple is being more sophisticated than the post author realises. If they have statistical control charts, for example, there may well be no contradiction here at all (they would only be reviewing exceptional outliers). But with Apple's tight-lipped nature, I don't know if the evidence to decide that is out there yet.",1300568792

Eclipse or other IDEs would not be counter-cultural at all, it's just there isn't a need for that given the languages we work in. I also have 2 Windows machines at home, 1 Ubuntu VM, 2 Ubuntu machines (although one died), access to CentOS, and recently got an MacBook Air for home too. I thought I would be best at my work with a MBP and chose that among my options between a Mac/PC.<p>It's true that we don't have that many requirements at that low-level right now, but we certainly do have some work done lower than the web-stack -- we even got an ex-Ksplice engineer joining us to help with that.<p>But maybe I could also have included some of the deficiencies too, to make it a little more balanced--I agree with you it does seem too rosy with what I had mentioned, but overall the experience has been really positive.

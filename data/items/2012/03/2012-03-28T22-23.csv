And then I couldn't work on half of my older projects.<p>In fact, it was so messed up, it motivated me to go out and buy a new Macbook (I needed a new computer anyway, but it provided a major impetus to go out and get one).<p>And that's just me.  Even worse is the fact that I work on a lot of Rails projects with a designer who lives in Montreal, which is a good six hour drive from where I live.  I've helped him get Rails set up on his computer, but it has not been easy - far from it.  As a non-techie his computer is prone to all sorts of weird shit, he hates the CLI, he needs to be walked through, line-by-line, any situation involving some weird gem dependency nonsense - it's a horrible waste of my time.

Perhaps I am too quick to read racism against Russians into such an inflammatory use of the word ""Russian"" due to the amount of racial discrimination I have seen against Russian users while working in the game industry, where it is not uncommon to dismiss Russian gamers as probably a pirate or probably a hacker and to refuse them a level of support that would be provided to a person with a different accent or last name.",1332974881

Just unclear about the distinction you're drawing.<p>I'd argue that UX design -- even if it didn't have that exact name -- has been a distinct discipline long before software. Just ask anyone in the food service industries, the retail industry (department stores were basically innovations in UX in retail; so was IKEA), the casino gaming industry, the amusement park industry, and so forth.<p>Casinos, in particular, are fascinating UX case studies. The person who first thought of modern casino layout, comping free drinks at table games, oxygenating the gambling floor, removing clocks from the walls, comping rooms and other amenities for big spenders and regulars, which games to place adjacent to which others, etc., was a UX designer in spirit if not in title. And those decisions were pretty rigorously tested and quantified. These things may not meet the technical definition of UX as we commonly speak of it on HN, but they certainly hold with the spirit of the discipline Don Norman would later come to articulate as ""UX.""",1332974515

You will get a far, far higher ROI on your news reading time with us than anywhere else.  Another way to imagine it is getting the cream of the crop news from your brightest friends in several different fields, all vetted multiple times before it reaches you.  The big differentiators between us and others kicking around in this space are:<p>1) Our algorithm is hyperfocused on quality (your unique, subjective definition) rather than topic, keywords, etc. 
2) Our social aspect dynamically adjusts the influence of your friends and other users, elevating friend a's tech recommendations (you like) but screening his political stuff (you don't care for).  In our beta testing, the most pleasant surprise for me was how much I enjoyed/got into different areas of the news that I did not previously follow now that I had it vetted by people I trusted.
3) In politics, we show the best arguments of left, middle and right all together so that people can control bias, etc.<p>Where we're currently at: After a great month in beta testing (very high interest, and a lot of great, constructive feedback), we shut it down last week in order to:

It implements a map/reduce model with many workers and multiple (for failover) masters. All data is held in memory for speed purposes. Things that are amazing about go: fun and fast to develop in; beautifully designed (rockstart founding team, than you!); RPC, net channels, and maps and strings, to name a few. The ability to quickly create servers to host business logic. Interfaces and ""inheritance"" model are both very elegant and clean. Compile times rock. Everything was built with the standard Go (pre 1) install; not a single other package was needed--the very complete standard lib is a blessing.<p>Two ""could be better"" points. Go has a hard memory limit per instance of ~ 15 GB; bad when you want to pin lots of data in memory. Russ says this issue is being tracked (2142) and will get fixed after Go 1 gets out the door. So patience will fix this one.<p>Second, there needs to be more examples of Go code out int the wild for others to share and look at. Using the template  package got me stuck, for example, and seeing code cleared up my issue but that was hard to find. This we can all help with by using Go and talking about it.

It is very important for Unity to (over)explain the terms.<p>The cases where the new terms will apply seem to apply primarily to paid flash-based games.
The problem is: who does pay for flash games? These games are not on mobile devices and on my browser I have never felt the need to purchase a Flash-based game.<p>So, to me, it looks more like a scare tactic aimed at Unitys developers.
This will protect the development tools that Adobe is selling.
Lets be frank: you either provide the tools for free and charge for the distribution (the Apple way)or you charge for the tools and provide the runtime/distribution for free (the Adobe way).
It might be a generalization, but the gist is there. Is Adobe planning to give the tools for free? I am sure as hell theyre not.
So, we should start complaiing that Adobe is not open and that they are imposing unfair controls on developers. (Does it ring a bell?  Adobe vs Apple)",1332972856

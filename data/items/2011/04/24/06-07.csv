2478425,comment,2476440,2477284,4,0,onan_barbarian,,,"My feeling is that this notion that each level of abstraction makes 'everything above that level easier, including sophisticated algorithms that would be 2 or 3 levels up' is simply not true.<p>Just because easy things are easier in a language with map/reduce and gc and whatever else, doesn't necessarily mean that things that were hard before will fit cleanly into the mechanism.<p>Your idea that things that are 'completely unthinkable to maintain in Fortran or C' are somehow much easier in this kind of environment is just silly; there are multiple orders of magnitude more parallel code written in both of those languages than map/reduce and many of the classic parallel algorithms and (wince) design patterns like parallel prefix were written in these languages originally or are easily expressed that way.<p>The _hard_ algorithms are ones with sophisticated communication requirements that aren't well captured by map/reduce, so in this case, having a abstraction to deal with the easy cases has accomplished nothing towards making hard cases easier.<p>I'm not against abstraction, of course - just this premature triumphalism that picking a 'easy things become easy' approach gets you, especially if you don't solve the hard things.",1303628077
2478424,comment,2476584,2477481,1,0,lupatus,,,"The USA, however, isn't exactly ""declining"". As the article I linked to above noted, the USA is continuing to grow across a broad spectrum of measures.  Yes, China and the EU may be growing at a faster rate in some of those categories, but the USA has such a great initial advantage that it will be a long, long time until another country catches or surpases the USA in even one of those categories.<p>So, let us take your simplified example and expand it a little to see a broader macroeconomic picture that illustrates why Brazil and China would want to do that trade in dollars.  Let's say that Brazil wants to use the cash from that commodity sale to improve the living conditions of their citizens and purchase some Catepillar brand forest-clearing bulldozers and some crude oil to refine into gasoline for those bulldozers because their local sugar-cane ethanol would wear-out the engines too quickly. Well, Catepillar is a American company so it makes sense for them to bill Brazil in USD instead RMB.  The middle east oil exporter also charges Brazil in USD because the US Navy protects their shipping lanes and the CIA and State Dept maintains (or doesn't) the internal stability of that country.  Last, China has USD coming out of its ears and is more than happy to trade pieces of paper for real assets like Brazillian ore.<p>Now, why would the Chinese want Brazil to pay them in USD for some Chinese goods?  The Chinese are smart and recognize that if the USD sank too far in value that the manufacturing jobs in China would return to the USA.  This is a problem for the Communists because they do not have a sufficient internal economy to continue employing hundreds of millions of peasants.  And, that would be a dangerous political problem for the Communist leadership in China.<p>Now, I will agree that this assumes linear development, but it would take a situation like WWII to knock the USA out of reserve currency status, and I don't think that is very likely.<p>In conclusion, welcome to Pax Americana; you should learn to  love it.",1303628054

We bought more hardware instead of a UPS system for our data center.  Once or twice a year, we experience a power blip and lose all our compute nodes (infrastructure is on UPS).  We would send out an apology email to our users and tell them to resubmit their jobs.  Worst case scenario was someone had to restart a 14 day job.

2478396,comment,2477656,2477656,1,0,pw,,,"What I like most about developing on EC2 is the ability to save an development environment as an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), and then spin up instances of it as needed. I can fine-tune the environment over time (just spin up a new instance, make changes, and save a new AMI), as well as have different environments for different types of development.<p>I think you could do something similar with Slicehost/Linode using disk images and configuration profiles, but it doesn't seem they offer anything like Amazon's machine images. Correct me if I'm wrong, though.<p>Of course, the flip-side of all this is that any individual instance of an AMI is inherently ephemeral, and you need to treat it as such. Even the reliability claims of EBS are fairly weak. [1] That means EC2 instance storage, even EBS storage attached to an instance, isn't truly persistent, and I haven't quite ironed out my system for dealing with this.<p>You'll probably want to run your own Git server [2] and commit code as it's completed. That still leaves the possibility of data loss if your instance dies after you've written code, but before you've made a commit. You could just take periodic snapshots of the EBS volume where your in-progress code resides, but whatever period you choose for the frequency (like every 30 minutes) is equal to the amount of work you could lose. And that sort of constant backup isn't really what snapshots are meant for anyway. [3] I think the ideal solution would be to run Dropbox to get continuous backups of the files you're working on. That might also make recovery easier. Attaching an orphaned EBS volume to another instance isn't hard, but it's certainly not as easy has having Dropbox download the file you were just working on.<p>--------------------<p>1. <a href=""http://blog.rightscale.com/2008/08/20/amazon-ebs-explained/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.rightscale.com/2008/08/20/amazon-ebs-explained/</a><p>2. <a href=""http://alestic.com/alestic-git/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alestic.com/alestic-git/</a> and make sure you're taking frequent EBS snapshots. The right way to do this is with ec2-consistent-snapshot and XFS (see <a href=""http://alestic.com/2011/02/ec2-consistent-snapshot-sceencast"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alestic.com/2011/02/ec2-consistent-snapshot-sceencast</a>).<p>3. I might be wrong about this. The fact that you should lock the file system to ensure a consistent snapshot makes very frequent (say, every minute) snapshots <i>seem</i> like a bad idea. Maybe you could get around this by not locking the file system for snapshot when dealing with plain files (and not a database), as consistency should be less of issue. Maybe I just don't know what I'm talking about ;-)",1303626171

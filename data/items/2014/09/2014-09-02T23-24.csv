8260841,comment,8258652,8259123,1,0,Houshalter,,,"Sort of. It depends on the learning algorithm used. Typically some form of local optimization is used that gets it to a good local optima. This is usually good enough and fast. However you can use methods of global optimizations or whatever optimization algorithm you want to use.<p>NNs themselves are sort of agnostic to the algorithm you use to set their weights. It&#x27;s sort of like saying &quot;computers are Turing complete, but can we ever prove that human programmers are smart enough to program any function.&quot;",1409702349

This is because the space of GC algorithms is very large (conservative, copying, etc.), and the algorithms make different, stark tradeoffs.<p>And because it is so large, every objection to garbage collection can be met! Garbage collection is too slow? Here&#x27;s a two-space copying collector, optimized for allocation throughput. Memory usage too high? Here&#x27;s a mark-and-sweep compacting collector. Latency too high? Here&#x27;s a pauseless concurrent collector. Want GC in C? Here&#x27;s a conservative collector.<p>More options are good! But here&#x27;s the sneakiness: you can&#x27;t have all of them. You aren&#x27;t going to have a compacting conservative collector, or a pauseless copying collector. Etc.<p>For example, the FAQ asks, &quot;Can I use garbage collection in C++?&quot;, and answers yes, you can! It then goes on to say that &quot;garbage collection is often faster than manual memory management. It can also improve performance indirectly, by increasing locality of reference and hence reducing the size of the working set, and decreasing paging.&quot;<p>The implication is that if you use GC in C++, you will see better locality of reference and reduced paging. But of course you will not.",1409701587

8260759,comment,8259817,8259817,5,0,tokenadult,,,"I read the previously submitted comments here in this thread before reviewing the link kindly submitted here. (I remember this report from the year it was first published.) The paper compares the country Finland to the region Karelia conquered from Finland by Russia and now part of Russia. Life expectancy in Finland[1] is much better than that in Russia,[2] so if the trade-off of growing up in a clean environment is that I don&#x27;t die of something else but life into healthy old age with some annoying allergies (I do have allergies, so I am well aware of how annoying they can be), I&#x27;ll take that trade-off. The last time we had an active thread about the hygiene hypothesis here on HN, there were all kinds of n=1 anecdotes from various participants here about refraining from using soap and other socially silly practices. There is a big attitude here on HN that modern life is bad for us somehow. That attitude is mistaken.<p>The article &quot;The Biodemography of Human Ageing&quot; by James Vaupel,[3] originally published in the journal Nature in 2010, is a good current reference on the subject of how much life expectancy has improved at ALL ages in the developed world. Vaupel is one of the leading scholars on the demography of aging and how to adjust for time trends in life expectancy. His striking finding is &quot;Humans are living longer than ever before. In fact, newborn children in high-income countries can expect to live to more than 100 years. Starting in the mid-1800s, human longevity has increased dramatically and life expectancy is increasing by an average of six hours a day.&quot;[4] An article in a series on Slate, &quot;Why Are You Not Dead Yet? Life expectancy doubled in past 150 years. Here’s why&quot;[5] Provides some of the background. Yep, perhaps in the clean modern world, our immune systems aren&#x27;t challenged as much as they used to be, but we also get sick less often and live to much older ages with good health. Life expectancy at age 40, at age 60, and at even higher ages is still rising throughout the developed countries of the world.[6] That&#x27;s a trade-off I will happily accept. My mom (who also has allergies) is eighty-one years old and still living independently and enjoying her favorite activities, and she has sisters and brothers older than she is who are still in good health. Girls born since 2000 in the developed world are more likely than not to reach the age of 100, with boys likely to enjoy lifespans almost as long. If that&#x27;s what I have to put up with after living in a clean environment in my youth, I can deal with that.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=Finland+life+expectancy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=Finland+life+expectancy</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=Russia+life+expectancy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=Russia+life+expectancy</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.demographic-challenge.com/files/downloads/2eb51e2860ef54d218ce5ce19abe6a59/dc_biodemography_of_human_ageing_nature_2010_vaupel.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.demographic-challenge.com/files/downloads/2eb51e2...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.prb.org/Journalists/Webcasts/2010/humanlongevity.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.prb.org/Journalists/Webcasts/2010/humanlongevity....</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science_of_longevity/2013/09/life_expectancy_history_public_health_and_medical_advances_that_lead_to.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science_of_...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box/scientificamerican0912-54_BX1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box...</a>",1409700512

But whether those memories existed in the appendages or in the brain was never well known. I think this gives more credit to the idea that some memories are actually stored in the Peripheral Nervous System.<p>As a thought experiment, lets say a famous guitarist loses an arm and gets a perfect transplant or a prosthetic which perfectly matches their previous dexterity. Would it perform as well as their old hand, or was the hand performing additional calculations on incoming and outgoing data that could never fully be replicated by a replacement.<p>Now take it a step further and assume a random person receives a famous guitarists arm in a perfect transplant.  That arm is an instrument in itself with its stored knowledge, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the receiving brain knows how to communicate effectively with it. I&#x27;m sure they would have basic communication, but the extended neural vocabulary of the old Brain-hand pair would be known to the new host-brain.<p>Personally, I believe it is a tandem effort between CNS and PNS in which each becomes accustomed to the signals sent by the other.<p>For example: A brain tells a finger to curl HARD, the finger neurons receive the brains input, modulates it with local factors, and sends it to the muscle. \nLikewise, the finger knows the feel of the strings exceptionally well, and can send highly detailed messages back to the brain who is used to receiving highly detailed messages. But in the new host who doesn&#x27;t know this advanced feeling, it just feels like a regular old input.",1409699506

10541018,comment,10540596,10540781,0,0,olympus,,,"From previous experience, having to exclude communications from a single entity (or single type of entity) is not going to shut anything down.<p>Case in point:  It is unconstitutional to conduct surveillance on US citizens without a warrant.  Therefore the NSA&#x27;s massive collection machine must exclude every single American, right?  Wrong.  What they did instead was implement a filter where the accuracy of excluding a US citizen is greater than 50%.  So if your exclusion rate is only 60% you &quot;accidentally&quot; catch 40% of US citizens in your surveillance net, but you have met the requirements.<p>Similarly in this case if surveillance must exclude communications from a single law firm then they only have to implement a filter where they are more likely to exclude the communications than they are to catch them.  &quot;Accidentally&quot; catching their communications would still be allowed since the filter would be meeting the requirements.",1447178388

At Cronitor we recently moved in the opposite direction -- from a limited freemium model to a free-trial -- for similar reasons.<p>Our free plans were limited to an extent that they didn&#x27;t blow-up our service. Our primary concern was that as we&#x27;ve built out our product, introduced more advanced features, and signed bigger customers, the risk that a free user could degrade service for paying customers no longer seemed worth it. We considered isolating free users in a separate silo but maintaining that infrastructure also didn&#x27;t seem worth it.<p>Ultimately these are hard problems to test because rolling out a change like this requires a lot of work. Even if you release it via b-test you&#x27;ve already made a real investment to get that far.<p>For those curious, we are keeping the free trial model but we do hope to continue improving trial conversion.<p>Edit: For clarity",1447178359

Sharing intimate details like this is fantastic.<p>Where I&#x27;m struggling is that there are a number of questionable choices here with little justification. For example, why a HTTP front-end? This is fine for webhooks but I&#x27;m not going to let my website&#x27;s backend open an HTTP connection for every event I want to send out.

However, as mentioned by others, the time savings of going to a store vs. shopping online justifies a little extra cost to me. Amazon solves a few other problems too:<p>* Security: The more online stores I use, the higher my risk of identify theft. Amazon isn&#x27;t perfect, but they both have more resources and more incentive (higher stakes) to protect my information than small online retailers. One tradeoff that must be balanced is that Amazon knows more about me.<p>Note that if Bitcoin were more widely accepted, and retailers collected less personal information, the security offered by Amazon would be less important.<p>* Selection: Amazon doesn&#x27;t have every product available, but it does have more selection than most retail stores. I tend to look for high value (high quality to cost ratio) products because I want things that work well and last long. It&#x27;s often difficult or impossible to find the same selection at local stores.",1447178351

What a load of crock.<p>Yes, Amazon&#x27;s prices aren&#x27;t the lowest for many things.  They never say they are.  Prices at Home Depot are often much, much lower for many home items, and you definitely have to do comparison shopping.  Which means continuing to sit down, and move your mouse and clicking and typing.

I run my own root and other zones.  I also use DNSCurve.<p>Recently there was another one of these DNSSEC advertisement posts from this same company about DNSSEC on the HN front page.  (Surprise.  How unusual.)<p>I asked a simple question: What benefit would DNSSEC offer someone like me?<p>While I did not get any straight answers, I did get blasted with walls of text from some guy working for a domain name registrar.<p>Perhaps it is not only companies selling consulting and DNS appliances, e.g., on government contracts, that are behind DNSSEC.  Maybe it extends to the entire &quot;DNS industry&quot;, e.g., people &quot;selling&quot; (renting) domainnames to users.  For readers who are unaware, Cloudflare is in this &quot;DNS industry&quot;.  Their customers must hand over control of their DNS to Cloudflare.  Cloudflare&#x27;s entire approach to &quot;security&quot; depends on this.<p>DNSSEC is generally a PITA to set up and maintain.  This makes it the perfect &quot;service&quot; to sell.  If you like to generalize, you could argue this is true for any sufficiently complex networking component.  The more complex the set up and management for users, the easier it is to sell them services.<p>I am an ordinary user who happens to enjoy setting up and managing my own DNS, making databases of IP addresses and even making my own domainnames, so I need a lot of convincing to be interested in something like DNSSEC, managed by third parties.<p>DNSSEC, as advertised, is a system that focuses on some mythical &quot;validation&quot; of DNS data.<p>Who decides what DNS data is &quot;valid&quot;?<p>Does DNSSEC require a &quot;web of trust&quot; model like the CA system?<p>If yes, why should we trust these third parties more than the endpoint we&#x27;re trying to reach?<p>How much will users have to pay to be &quot;validated&quot; in such a system?<p>If some third party(s) controls what is and what is not &quot;valid&quot; DNS data can they more easily &quot;disable&quot; certain domains?<p>I could go on.<p>By contrast, a system for encrypting DNS packets is something I find more interesting and useful.  I can set it up without too much effort and I control it.  No need for third parties.  Once more, it costs me nothing.  There is no built-in idea of &quot;web of trust&quot; and I do not need to &quot;purchase&quot; a &quot;valid&quot; dommainname to begin using it.<p>But I am just a dumb user so what do I know?

You concede that your views are too complicated to explain here, but do not provide so much as a hint nor a reference or citation for me to gauge them. Your link to the Pournelle chart though implies you&#x27;re libertarian-leaning to an extent. I can&#x27;t precisely tell with lack of details.<p>I don&#x27;t know who &quot;We&quot; will be in the population after a Second American Civil War. I assume it will be more than the Three Percent. That you tritely rebut again with the apathy strikes me as unprincipled.

Clearly you must set a framework after all is over.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s not my job to educate you&quot; makes you sound just like a postmodernist, but I digress.<p>Alright, TWANLOC. That&#x27;s a rather naive and almost vicious view, that everyone who is outside your bubble must be a subhuman. Most people are not statist expropriators, and actually are sympathetic to voluntary relations with a classical liberal outlook on things, but again may not break out of the present statist framework. The goal should be exchange of ideas, not slaughtering them like sheep. Such disregard of life, such infringement on self-ownership is ironically borne from the same progressivist authoritarian ideas that lead to molding men and preaching doctrines of original sin. The original sin here being... not agreeing with the Three Percent, I don&#x27;t know.<p>&quot;Repression by brute force is always a confession of the inability to make use of the better weapons of the intellect — better because they alone give promise of final success. This is the fundamental error from which Fascism suffers and which will ultimately cause its downfall. The victory of Fascism in a number of countries is only an episode in the long series of struggles over the problem of property. The next episode will be the victory of Communism. The ultimate outcome of the struggle, however, will not be decided by arms, but by ideas. It is ideas that group men into fighting factions, that press the weapons into their hands, and that determine against whom and for whom the weapons shall be used. It is they alone, and not arms, that, in the last analysis, turn the scales.&quot; -- Ludwig von Mises<p>It may well be that people derive similar conclusions but from different <i>a priori</i> frameworks (see: left-libertarians v. right-libertarians).

Is surveillance not a pressing issue?<p>(I think &quot;progressivist&quot; is a better term for people who believe in molding the individual through state and corporate means.)<p>Ultimately, your words are all too vacuous, and so my responses are similarly vacuous with no real recourse.

There&#x27;s also DNSSEC-trigger with Unbound for local DNSSEC validation. Maybe someone on here knows more, but I believe this directly addresses this issue. DNSSEC also is completely orthogonal to things like dprive which encrypt DNS queries. I&#x27;m not that familiar with DNSCurve but I believe it functions similar to dprive.<p><i>its real use case, that of replacing the CAs with DNS TLD operators, has the net effect of signing Internet cryptographic trust over to the world governments that control the most important TLDs.</i><p>I think you&#x27;re referring to DANE, and DANE is not intended to replace the CA system, but instead augment it. See my article on this here: <a href=""http://metafarce.com/adventures-in-dane/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://metafarce.com/adventures-in-dane/</a>. DANE simply provides another means to verify the authenticty of a TLS cert, it doesn&#x27;t replace the CA system, and having multiple methods for ensuring cert integrity is a net positive for the Internet.<p>The foundations of our CA system are not sound. Any compromised CA threatens sites secured by all CAs. In addition to specifying a hash of a site&#x27;s TLS cert, DANE allows a site operator to lock down their trust anchor to the single CA they use.<p>I also don&#x27;t get the <i>signing Internet cryptographic trust over to the world governments</i> thing. Please explain how you reach this conclusion. I&#x27;ve deployed DANE on a .com, and I never gave any private keys to anyone. I only needed to provide a hash of my TLS cert to my DNS provider. Granted my DNS provider could change the hash to something else, or redirect my site to somewhere else. Also, the TLD operator for .com could redirect my NS records to somewhere else as well, and then sign it with the TLD&#x27;s ZSK. But they can already do that without DNSSEC, and I would notice this pretty quickly and attribute the attack to them.<p><i>the protocol is famously annoying to deploy and has caused major outages, including breaking the first day of HBO Now across all of Comcast.</i><p>This is where I will agree with you. DNSSEC is tough and complicated to deploy. However, this does not mean it has no value. If companies like Cloudflare make it easier to deploy DNSSEC then that is a net win for Internet security.<p><i>DNSSEC isn&#x27;t about helping you with your security issues.</i><p>I really like being able to trust what DNS servers tell me.

Just that you can do without them too (which is true -- nobody argues that you can&#x27;t).<p>Besides, isn&#x27;t Paul Grahams whole &quot;Blub&quot; concept based on the idea that people using languages without X features have little means to understand their importance (and what they&#x27;re missing)?<p>In any case, there are counter-examples to what you write too: several posts from teams that have used Go in production that say they like it but still lament the lack of generics.<p>><i>And yes, I&#x27;ve spent plenty of time using languages that do support generics. It can save you time but I&#x27;ve found it also enables &quot;looser&quot; code, which can be more error-prone. In fact one of my favorite things about Go is how restrictive its type system is. I feel a lot more confident about my code doing only what I think it&#x27;s doing when using Go.</i><p>Generics are not &quot;loose&quot;, if anything they&#x27;re even tighter type-wise than what Go makes you do to overcome their absence. Either you create concrete types for everything, ad nauseum, or you go &quot;loose&quot; and use interface{} and the like, throwing a lot of assurances out of the window.<p>><i>If the language is not for you, move on. There are plenty of us who are perfectly happy to write code without generics.</i><p>Again, happiness doesn&#x27;t say much -- that&#x27;s personal preference and can&#x27;t be debated.<p>Java programmers were perfectly happy to write code without Generics and Closures for like 15 years too. Most were even oblivious that those things existed in the PL world at large. Javascript programmers suffered without correct scoping or an import system for 20 years, etc.",1447177279

And it would be perfectly good thing if you were the only human in the universe. But I think you haven&#x27;t simulated the evolution of a system where such thing was the primary value and there is more than one human present - where you can&#x27;t have everyone having perfect freedom to do anything. Let&#x27;s try and do it.<p>First, you start with humans who value their freedom to do anything. It means that I value my freedom of taking food you collected. You value your freedom to fight me back. The system is one of violence defining bounderies of freedoms. It&#x27;s not a very productive system. Humans are smart, so we notice that if we mutually agreed to suspend our freedom of taking the resources of others (which we will now call &quot;theft&quot; or &quot;robbery&quot;), we can reduce our defense spending and put the work to satisfying other goals. It works well, but it&#x27;s a fragile arrangement - the first person to defect and draw their sword gets the resources of the rest. So (skipping some stages) we figure out that we may codify the agreement to not steal/rob and outsource the enforcement (including violence) to a group of people that will get some of our resources as a reward. And hence, the rule of law is born, and everyone is happier and more productive.<p>Going through this process is what defines <i>civilization</i>. And I want to live in a civilization.",1447176494

You don&#x27;t have to buy them.  You can just use them.<p>Now, if we were talking about an electric guitar or something, this comment would be sort of out of order.  But the whole point of modular synths is that you want to spend time fiddling around and plugging parts together.  If you want to do that, come to the software side.  We have <i>WAY BETTER PARTS</i> to plug together.  You can make them sound like <i>anything</i>, including analog synth modules.  <i>And</i> you can get inspired by how <i>other people</i> plugged them together because you can upload your patches to web sites.  It&#x27;s nothing less than a vastly improved substitute to analog modular synths.<p>Back in the 1970s, computers were too slow to do much in software.  Even the famous Deep Note, from the 1980s, used hardware oscillators under computer control (although it&#x27;s a fantastic example of the expressive power software gives you).  A PC in the 1970s might be able to manage 300,000 instructions per second, and maybe 10,000 floating-point operations.  Now you can do literally <i>ten billion</i> floating-point operations per second on an off-the-shelf CPU, a <i>million</i> times faster, or eight <i>trillion</i> on an off-the-shelf GPU, almost a <i>billion</i> times faster.  This brings a lot of amazing stuff into reach that wasn&#x27;t before, including even things like RF modulation and demodulation.<p>RF downconversion, though, still takes analog electronics.  Computers still aren&#x27;t fast enough.<p>I&#x27;ve done some work with Diego Alberti on real-time music synthesis on a microcontroller.  Because the real-time audio synthesis wasn&#x27;t taxing enough for the CPU, we decided to generate a composite video signal in software visualizing the waveform, too: <a href=""https://github.com/kragen/ar_bytebeat"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kragen/ar_bytebeat</a><p>He carried this work forward, and it is currently on exhibit at the +CODE exhibit at the Centro Cultural General San Martín until the end of this week, if you&#x27;re in Buenos Aires.<p>With that kind of thing, hopefully you won&#x27;t have to spend US$300 on a netbook to experiment with software synthesis.

Joe and Mike were awesome the best on the market: They could forecast sales like no one else.<p>So, one day, the companies decided to send the consultants on a new planet to evaluate the shoe market. Joe called back and said: &quot; <i>Kill it, these creatures don&#x27;t wear shoes. There&#x27;s nothing to sell. I&#x27;m coming back</i> &quot;. Mike arrive two days later, called back and said: &quot; <i>This is awesome! No one here wears shoes, we must build a production unit here and take over the planet! Call the board immediately!</i> &quot;. About 50 years later, Company2 was had 80% of the shoe market on the new planet. Company1 joined 30 years later but never gained a substantial market share on this planet.<p>About five years after the events discussed above, the companies send the consultants on a very well known planet. The companies had no market share on this planet. Joe was there first and after evaluating the market called back and said: &quot;Hey, there are is huge competition here, but I&#x27;ve found flaws on nearly every major player and the market is HUGE!

The play-json library is how I first started messing with this stuff, but the circe library the author wrote seems to take this to another level. The latter not only seems conceptually and functionally simpler, but is more powerful, given its direct support for sealed trait hierarchies, a core feature of Scala. And it seems to do so in a pretty intuitive way, representing a subtype as a JSON object with the subtype name as the key and a subobject as the value set, as opposed to synthesizing a `type` field of some sort to disambiguate the cases.<p>My biggest complaint is with some of Scala&#x27;s ergonomics for working on the type level.

A startup would first hire a noncitizen remotely and give them equity, and then by the time they&#x27;re ready to bring the remote employee on-site (maybe after a B round or so), the value of that equity will have skyrocketed, making their total comp competitive with big tech companies.<p>Startups that aren&#x27;t on that growth curve shouldn&#x27;t be hiring remotely, or hiring at all really.<p>I&#x27;m not certain that a COL adjustment is necessary either.  The higher COL in the Bay Area and NYC reflects the higher productivity of workers in firms in those regions.

This is not really a valid distinction. That&#x27;s the thing about Lisps, that much of the language is implemented in the language itself. Macros make the language easier to extend by both the language designer and random developers and users in appropriate cases. You can keep special forms to a minimum. Those those functions and macros are considered part of the core language even if they aren&#x27;t special forms.",1447174934

A douche bag. I&#x27;m calling our figurative guy names not because I need to vent out. I&#x27;m providing a social disincentive for such behaviour. The vaguely defined terms like &quot;asshat&quot; are actually part of the way society incentivizes one to behave in a particular way. Mostly, it incentivizes <i>cooperation</i> (as in Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma) and disincentivizes defection. In the West, such incentive structures are individually much weaker than economic ones - but still, when they are aggregated, they form a powerful force. Services like AirBnB and Uber unfortunately slowly erode social/cultural incentives, turning citizens into competitors instead of cooperators.<p>> <i>Another comment mentioned that landlords are inserting language into leases that they get the profits from AirBnB if it&#x27;s used. That seems like a reasonable response to me.</i><p>And this is the <i>bad</i> outcome. The end result is the same as before AirBnB subletting became a thing, but now the contracts have additional clause that will probably be phrased vaguely enough to destroy some use cases that would be beneficial for both parties. That&#x27;s the bad result I&#x27;m talking about - the side that&#x27;s being cheated won&#x27;t just lie down and admit defeat, they&#x27;ll take up arms and defend themselves. In the end things are worse for everyone involved.<p>> <i>Wagging your finger and moralizing is only going to convince people who probably weren&#x27;t going to do it anyway. If you want to change behavior, you have to change the incentives.</i><p>I am changing the incentives (in a very small way - armchair activism, I know). I&#x27;m trying to highlight the problems in hope that some readers who may not have noticed them before will notice them now and opt out of contract-breaking subletting, and will discourage others from doing so as well.

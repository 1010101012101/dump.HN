Some in the Libraries. Most in its VM. I would pick Haskell or ATS over Erlang - unless I need those few unique features that Erlang/OTP <i>really got right</i>.<p>> That makes as much sense as saying your language shouldn&#x27;t run on the kitchen-sink Linux so as not to homogenized the OS field.<p>No, your analogy is moving the goal post. No one ever said someone couldn&#x27;t implement Erlang the language for the JVM. As many people have pointed out to you, it isn&#x27;t the language that makes Erlang. It&#x27;s BEAM + OTP. We&#x27;re not talking about moving the language around, we&#x27;re talking about gutting the VM, my statement still holds: Exalting the JVM to be the one-true-VM for Erlang (therefore also implying any language you do not understand well that needs a VM) is a <i>very bad idea</i> and pretty silly.<p>Diversity is good. BEAM&#x27;s VM is good. The JVM is good. Even the CLR is pretty amazing (F# beats the pants off of Scala). There&#x27;s no reason at all to think that Erlang would be better off on the JVM; however, borrowing successful ideas from other awesome and successful technologies? I think that&#x27;s a swell path to walk. Beware of the kitchen sink, though, is my only warning.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t always think OS&#x27; are the best place to run your application. There are many arguments for using something like Erlang on Xen or HaLVM if the design requirements can justify it but arguing about your other critical statement should be a different thread.",1439128716

These brands I mention below, except Orvis, can be bought on eBay for under a hundred dollars.  Most of the time they just need a service, or a new stem?<p>Names like Benrus, Elgin, Orvis, Oris, Hellbros, and a buch of ETA movements, with obscure names, are great watches, and one day just might become more collectable than they are presently?<p>These mechanical watches were worn by the working man.  They all had great movements.  I repair watches, and I can&#x27;t tell the difference in quality between Rolex movements and most Benrus Movements on the older models.<p>Once you have a basic set of tools, and a little bit of knowledge on these old watches; you really start to see the beauty/value of old mechanical watches.  With me--it started out as a hobby, to maybe a career?  In the near future I am coding two websites devoted to watchmaking.  One will be just about watch repair, and watch information.  The other will be my personal business website where I will sell and service watches.  I wish I got interested in Horology when I was younger?  The bug didn&#x27;t hit me until 10 years ago, when I got my first IWC cal. 89 watch.  The guy who sold it thought it was a Timex.  He sold it to me for $5.00.  Well I got it cleaned, and oiled, and has been on my wrist ever since.  It&#x27;s so old the letters on the dial are completely faded, so it doesn&#x27;t even look like an expensive watch.  I wear it in the worst parts of town.  I am the only one who knows it&#x27;s a extremely well designed/machined piece of watchmaking history.<p>So yes, I think vintage watches will go up in value.  I hope not for awhile--because right now I can still get good deals on EBay.  I just got a Omega Seamaster for a little over $100 dollars.

This is below the standard of paper I would have expected Black Hat to accept.<p>Good CSPRNG design is not a &quot;dark art&quot;, and entropy is not &quot;consumed&quot; when a good CSPRNG is used. Any good CSPRNG uses a good PRF - any good block cipher in CTR mode, a hash, or a HMAC, perhaps - to stretch one good, solid, 256-bit entropy seed into as much cryptographically-secure random data as you&#x27;ll ever need over the lifetime of your cryptosystem, and ratchets forward through the PRF after each call so the state cannot later be reversed (without breaking the PRF, but you&#x27;re using a good one, so you&#x27;ll be fine).<p>You need <i>quality</i> entropy to seed a CSPRNG - not quantity. Yes, it is, as we all know, very important you don&#x27;t try to use a CSPRNG before its initial seed has collected enough good entropy - which is, yes, a particular problem in embedded systems or headless servers - but after that, the entropy in your CSPRNG seed isn&#x27;t something that magically disappears, as you&#x27;ll see from the design of Linux&#x27;s newest random-number API, getrandom, patterned after the OpenBSD folks&#x27; ideas.<p>Reseeding a CSPRNG&#x27;s state with more entropy is not a benefit, but in fact a potential risk every time you do it: it can result in entropy injection attacks if an attacker can observe the state, and control some of the entropy. That, in turn, could break your whole cryptosystem, especially if you&#x27;re using fragile primitives like DSA or ECDSA.

10030252,comment,10028485,10028931,0,0,lostcolony,,,"The basic Erlang assumption is that bugs are predominantly due to state.<p>You would have tested at least the success path in your code (but not probably all the error conditions). &#x27;Logic bugs&#x27; then should fall on the non-critical path, so dropping the state that led you to take that path is okay; if it&#x27;s a critical process, you restart it into a known good state. A trivial example of this might be a user giving you bad input; any validation (or even a lack of validation, provided it breaks something down the line) should cause the data to drop, and the listening process to still be up (i.e., crash and restart into a known good state), ready to take other user requests (and to leave any other in process user requests alone).<p>For load, Erlang makes it easy to write code that automatically scales for load (up to the hardware limit, obviously). It also makes it easy to write code that can be distributed, running across multiple machines, and able to scale up that way as well. It&#x27;s also pretty easy to write rate limiters and things, to automatically shed load if you&#x27;re bottle necking somewhere.<p>Erlang also makes it harder for humans to break things (in the sense of user error, or production support tinkering with it). You can still do it, but the supervisor processes oftentimes help mitigate that (a human puts in bad state such that it affects an important process, the process will crash and restart).<p>How is it different than a try/catch? Because rather than trying to figure out every location that an error can occur in your code, you instead ask &quot;what happens if -anything- goes wrong with this process? How do I get this process back to a good state?&quot; You already partially answered this question when you created the process, and had to ask &quot;how do I start this process in a good state?&quot; Does the process depend on another process being up? Then you would have had to already specify as part of the supervisor that the other process is started first, and picked a supervision strategy that will restart that other process if this one restarts, causing both to dump their state and reinitialize. A try/catch, not only do you have to recognize each individual thing that can go wrong (or have a catch-all that hides errors), you have to decide how to recover from it, and it oftentimes is not at all clear how you do that. You end up with a lot more places you can miss handling errors, a lot of assumptions being made, and there isn&#x27;t a good way to tie multiple processes together.<p>Restarting an OS process is actually a great example of why this philosophy works well. If the app dies, restart it; it probably died because of bad state. You already understand that that is a great option for unexpected bugs that leave the entire app in a bad state. Only, oftentimes that&#x27;s overkill; your bad state is probably relegated to a very small part of the app, that, if the app is written in such a way that unrelated things stay unrelated (and communicate with just shared nothing message passing), can individually be restarted within the app. Subsystems, if you will. That&#x27;s what Erlang does. The idioms and functionality intrinsic to the language make it far easier to write code encapsulated across process lines, such that an error in one process can be treated as identical to any other error in that process, or that kind of process, and handled in a well defined way (drop the state; restart the process into a known good state), leaving the rest of the app unaffected.",1439127069

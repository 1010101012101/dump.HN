You have to assume that anything of value sent over the internet might be sniffed or at least could be sniffed by a well placed attacker. The last hop connection between your PC and the AP is hardly the only point at which your data is vulnerable. To assume otherwise is foolhardy.<p>That's why I said that the only additional risks I can see of an public Wifi is local attacks directly against your machine such as someone port scanning your laptop to look for vulnerable service or open fileshares, etc.",1288029580

There are a lot more Rails companies/jobs in the Bay area (though more Python than Ruby jobs, again because of science). Rails 3 shows the community is still going strong.<p>Sinatra is the most fun for simple web services and it integrates with Rails no problem.<p>And most importantly, you can use Heroku for Ruby deployment, which is an incredible short cut for launching a site and its impossible to go back to being a sys-admin once you realize it's not necessary.",1288029195

Anyone with the experience and skills to help you out has come across hundreds of (or likely has their own) ideas to execute on, and nothing you've said will make yours stand out.<p>Second, each of the points you're looking to learn about are simply a matter of googling a bit. Without knowing your backend, it's hard to tell you to either go use Heroku, or slicehost, or ec2. Security is highly context-dependent. And so on.<p>Anyway, it's very cool that you've taken your university project and have built on it, so congrats on that front. Often times the best ideas come from that setting.<p>Just share a bit more with us :)",1288026176

1830597,comment,1830002,1830002,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I think part of the issue is that Smart Bear readers probably aren't the best market for WPEngine. It's a cool concept, but look at their pricing here:<p><a href=""http://wpengine.com/select-plan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wpengine.com/select-plan</a><p>And features here:<p><a href=""http://wpengine.com/features"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wpengine.com/features</a><p>We make Wordpress fast, keep it secure, scale, curate plugins and themes, very easy backups, no lockin, and easy to edit. Outside of the last point, all those features are better geared for a newbie than someone who can handle technology.<p>Scaling, plugins, design, themes, backups, and exporting your data are relatively easier for the Smart Bear audience than the average user. I'm not sure it justifies $50/month at the lowest price point for the convenience if you already have the skills in that area. Ideally, they'd become the go-to platform for people who are already established in some way, but don't want to struggle with the technology too much. Like, a famous chef goes to start a blog, ideally when the chef asks someone for how to do this, that person says, ""Oh, you want WP Engine, it's the easiest."" $50/month is chips for someone established who decides blogging is a valuable part of their business. But for someone that can handle sifting through documents and research, the price point isn't really worth the features. That might be why the WPEngine didn't get as many sales from the launch notice as anticipated - the feature set seems most valuable for people with less computer-savvy.",1288026104

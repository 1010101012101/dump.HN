Off the top of my head:<p>- to focus on speed of development you could use a practice or warm-up<p>> provide each with a practice in another language<p>> provide a sample solution in pseudocode in both functional and imperative style<p>- To focus on speed of problem solving you could use topcoder data + research of participants programming language backgrounds.<p>The important thing is that if the effect is large it's easy to spot. According to some, the difference is an order of magnitude. If that's true, it will be trivial to spot.",1261904127
1016881,comment,1015120,1015541,0,0,RevRal,,,"I've been apprehensive about the Tarkovsky book, which was why I never bought it for myself. But he's my favorite director. It just seemed badly translated to me, from the preview I read on Amazon.<p>But now that I've read a few chapters, I have to say that this book is a must own for anyone who loves Tarkovsky. It still may be the case that the translation sucks, but I am over it. I'm going to to go through each of his movies one-by-one again, and read his corresponding chapters.<p>I recommend this book.",1261903707

An emergency pull handle is all you really need.<p>(2) A slow-but-steady retract mechanism.  grinich's idea for a small electric winch makes a lot of sense if a spring version couldn't do it slowly and steadily enough.<p>And if you're worried a moron won't listen to your amperage ratings, a built-in breaker.<p>Still, a nice-to-have in the kitchen, workshop, and garage.

1016873,comment,1016583,1016865,0,0,bOR_,,,"Not the easiests of problems though. Do you know what statistics you would apply?<p>IQ measurements seem to have a similar problem: doing test a, influences your score on test b, because you get more used to the problems presented.. but doing test a and b just marginally increases your general intelligence, which is what you are trying to measure, while it might have a big influence on someone's score in these tests.<p>With IQ tests, you can expect that doing test c till z will eventually saturate someone.. but that might only work because you generally do not get the answers. In coding, you do get the answer back (whether your code compiles/works or not), so eventually both programmers will just be limited by the speed with which they type.",1261902335
1016872,comment,1016515,1016661,0,0,ntoshev,,,"It is also startup-relevant because it illustrates the ""Wealth and power"" section from Paul Graham's ""How to Make Wealth"" <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html</a><p><i>Wealth and Power<p>Making wealth is not the only way to get rich. For most of human history it has not even been the most common. Until a few centuries ago, the main sources of wealth were mines, slaves and serfs, land, and cattle, and the only ways to acquire these rapidly were by inheritance, marriage, conquest, or confiscation. Naturally wealth had a bad reputation.<p>Two things changed. The first was the rule of law. For most of the world's history, if you did somehow accumulate a fortune, the ruler or his henchmen would find a way to steal it. But in medieval Europe something new happened. A new class of merchants and manufacturers began to collect in towns. [10] Together they were able to withstand the local feudal lord. So for the first time in our history, the bullies stopped stealing the nerds' lunch money. This was naturally a great incentive, and possibly indeed the main cause of the second big change, industrialization.<p>A great deal has been written about the causes of the Industrial Revolution. But surely a necessary, if not sufficient, condition was that people who made fortunes be able to enjoy them in peace. [11] One piece of evidence is what happened to countries that tried to return to the old model, like the Soviet Union, and to a lesser extent Britain under the labor governments of the 1960s and early 1970s. Take away the incentive of wealth, and technical innovation grinds to a halt.</i>",1261902296

1016870,comment,1016583,1016813,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"""I began to write a reply to your question, but decided that it deserved its own post""<p>That isn't really a reply to the question posed. Just more ranting and raving.<p>Sample: ""Yes, my dear bean counters, you can measure productivity.  I would no more ask you to stop in your attempts at its measurement than I would ask mosquitoes to stop sucking blood.   You can measure productivity – even of Lisp; even of political philosophies.  You will simply need to secure a very large bag of beans – one deep enough to hold a bean for every twist and turn of a century of tinkering, politicking, and everything else associated with the messy business of successfully thinking new thoughts.""<p>The best interpretation of this drivel  is that you want people to accept your claims of superior productivity just on your say so  but not ask for any evidence because asking you back up your unsubstantiated claims of superiority would be ""bean counting"".<p>Forget the scientific studies. There is another kind of ""evidence"" in programming - write code that is evidently superior. The best way to show that (say) Linux is an ""inferior"" operating system is to <i>build</i> one better. Not talk about making one sometime in the misty future. Build. Then talk.<p>Endless rants aren't as good.  As silentbicycle says elsewhere<p>""I just take issue with how some particularly vocal Lispers have been sitting on the sidelines going, ""Our language is THE BEST LANGUAGE"" for decades. (""Sick of being a blub programmer and working in Blub? Try our Language For Smart People."") They're so used to being smug because their language was thirty years ahead of its time, fifty years ago.""",1261902219

1016866,comment,1016260,1016809,0,0,neilc,,,"<i>he would fail miserably at starting a company because he equates the product/service his company would make/offer with his education</i><p>I think you misunderstood the post. The author said nothing about how his PhD would directly relate to starting a new company (the author's research is theoretical, anyway). Rather, the point is that by acquiring a valuable skill (a PhD from MIT), his risk profile is lower: he could go and start a new venture, or equivalently wager all his assets at the roulette table; either way, his skills mean he would be able to find a good job if the gamble doesn't turn out well.<p>If you like, substitute ""MIT PhD"" for ""become one of the top 5 Linux kernel developers"" for an equivalently rare, valuable skill that would help to ensure future employment.",1261901638

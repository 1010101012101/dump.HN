3817504,comment,3816962,3816962,6,0,daenz,,,"Downsampling images before a blur seems to be a pretty standard technique to get more perceived bang (blur) for your buck.  If you don't downsample the image too far, the blur adequately covers any artifacts the downsampling (and re-scaling) would have.  The result is, an N radius blur can be stretched a lot farther, because the downsampling (and re-scaling) itself adds an blur of its own.<p>This performance optimization doesn't really work for variable-width blurs (like depth of field) on 3d scenes though, because some parts of your image need to be crisp, while others blurred.  Downsampling the entire image would lose resolution on the crisp parts.<p>3d depth of field blurs are actually pretty interesting though.  They're variable width, which is just another way of saying that each pixel on the final image might be blurrier or less blurry than another pixel.  Implementing this kind of variable blurring is a tough task, and typically done by scaling up or scaling down a disk of random sampling coordinates for each pixel.  When the disk of coordinates is large, the sampling coordinates sample further from the pixel its centered on, so the resulting pixel has a bigger blur.  When the sampling disk is small, the surrounding coordinates are closer to the center pixel, creating a smaller blur.  The size of this sampling disk is controlled by the depth of the pixel from the near and far focus planes of the virtual camera.<p>I've glossed over a lot (like the artifacts that can result from 3d DoF), but Nvidia's GPU gems has a great article on the subject <a href=""http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems3/gpugems3_ch28.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems3/gpugems3_ch28.html</a>",1333986789

I think using Python plus a template language with good escaping basically solves the problem.<p>Also, it would be weird if html: and sql: are built in to the language -- that should be a layer on top of a smaller language (just like quasi-literals).<p>Also, a server-side language with special escaping support doesn't seem compelling, because these days you would want special escaping support on the client too.

Use of the word ""deserves"" in that context is one of those subtle abuses of the capabilities of language that verge on indoctrination. If you unpack it, you'll see that it implies the existence of some form of universal scoring system that everyone is a part of whether they want to be or not. Which is of course very far from the case, despite the existence of large groups of very missionary-minded folk who would like you to subscribe to that irrational belief.<p>This is one of many forms of what we might call adversarial grouping - very common when you see words like ""we"" and ""should"" showing up in sentences - in which the writer tries to place people, often the readers or listeners, into a specific memeplex without their consent. Given that the placing is usually happening at a level below the active topic, it is often surprisingly successful.<p>In this it shares a lot with the art of propaganda and advertising, illustrating that these things are points on a spectrum of abusive linguistics both grand and small.

So, is there a system in place that allows me to use any templating language that conforms to a given protocol? And where can I find that protocol? (in Padrino, for example, this is Tilt)<p>Okay, whats wrong with hamlet. It begins on google: ""yesod hamlet"" does not yield any meaningful documentation. ""Shakespearean Templates"" does. So ""Shakespearean Templates""[1] is a whole family of languages that solves a lot of problems already solved, but type-safe. Well... okay, so I do not only have to learn a whole new framework, I also have to learn 3 new languages (-2, if I only care about HTML templating). So, to me, the whole approach rings a bit of ""the world is wrong and we fix everything"". Considering gregwebs answer: even more so.<p>Hamlet just doesn't suit my tastes. I don't like auto-closing tags on intendation - any decent text editor should assist you enough to do that properly. I like how you put thought into generating URLs, but thats nothing the templating language should take care of. Also, Hamlet assumes that you are templating HTML - I often template other types as well, for example plain text - hence a need for replacing it by something that fits all needs better. In the end, I also prefer strictly logic-less templates, so hamlet doesn't cut it.<p>Also, the documentation should see some love. There is no way to have a look at the  features (and languages) in isolation: Its a stream of consciousness that introduces features in a half-sentence (I had to grep it to find what ""^"" means - it was what I expected it to be, but nevertheless).<p>That said, I still find Yesod a compelling framework and it will be the first haskell framework I'll try out next time I have some spare time. But the first thing I'll do is replace the templating.<p>[1]: I would prefer if they had anything to do with shakespeare, the esoteric programming language. ;)",1333985361

I'm not talking about LabView; it's literally the Lego Mindstorms language [1] that outranks Erlang, MATLAB, ActionScript, Scheme, Groovy, R, Scala, and so Forth.

I understand the potential bubble effects at work. I'm not arguing that Scala or Clojure or whatever's hip should come out on top. What I'm contesting is their notion of popularity. The measurements may be reliable (I don't think they are), but they're sure as hell not measuring anything worthwhile. NXT-G may be more ""popular"" in the sense of being Googled more often, but that's utterly irrelevant for 99% of all cases where you'd be interested in language popularity.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms_NXT#NXT-G"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms_NXT#NXT-G</a>",1333984957

I actually like syntax highlighting.

I need help seeing if I'm offbase here and what HN feels about this situation. The gist of the problem is that most of the company's equity is divided amongst cofounders who mostly help us, if we're lucky, 10 hours a week. The two of us who are full-time, 60+ hours/week, each only have 15/20% of the company. We are fully incorporated, launching a product now, and have a small angel investment (no real investor dilution yet).<p>The company was founded by six people who (so I hear) worked weekends for months getting a Wordpress prototype together and fleshing out an idea. I was brought on six months ago as a technical cofounder because they were struggling building the product backend, and since then we've built two complete products. However, since I've joined six months ago I've never really seen people work hard at all, except one day a week when we all meet which people skip half the time due to school or just not wanting to come. To rub salt in the wound, none of the part-time cofounders want to join us full-time once they graduate, or even just help out more over the summer as opposed to an internship elsewhere.<p>Everyone is vesting, and everyone has clearly breached their contract with us (a paltry 10 hrs/week). My cofounder argues that they took great risk spending months of weekends working on this before I joined, and that having them on board is better than nothing and provides some value. He says later if necessary we could dilute their shares, since everyone would agree they haven't been working as hard.<p>I favor offering fulltime positions with a small stipend (like my full-time partner and I) and stop everyone's vesting ASAP otherwise. My full-time cofounder and I are just hurting our own financial positions. It just isn't fair for people who spend barely a day a week on this to reap almost the same reward. Even if we don't redivide the equity, we could better use it by attracting someone really talented full-time.<p>Any advice on this would be amazing. I either just can't seem to get through to my cofounder, or my reasoning must be completely offbase. Thank you all in advance!",1333983758

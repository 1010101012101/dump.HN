What are the difficulties people are having with OO? How can I take this article seriously when it's nothing more than a statement followed by some fluff followed by a few half-thought suggestions. Who are these 'people these people who 'really understand' OO programming?<p>Am I one of them?<p>Are you?<p>How are we to know with no example of HOW OO is hard? What exactly is so hard about it?

Which Latin American countries do you mean?<p>""... truly excellent thought doesn't depend on the same skills that would allow scoring highly in an IQ test.""<p>I happen to agree with you! One thing that's bugged me for years is that you can't design a test that distinguishes, in advance, between cleverness and original stupidity. So that means that whole lot of time-consuming activities can only be measured after the fact if at all. The difference in our views, I think, is that I would argue that IQ tests measure the kind of raw data-processing skills that are useful in any situation (the military tests people heavily, and for all tasks they've found that IQ correlates positively with results -- I think for some technician jobs, it explains about 60% of the variance in individual performance). There just aren't any studies I know of showing that people with low scores on IQ tests go on to succeed in any measurable way. It would be convenient, to say the least, if you argued that the success-deficit among low IQ people is more than compensated for by a success-surplus that happens to be impossible to measure. So I'd like to know if you can find some way to quantify your argument. It would change my thinking on a lot of subjects if I found that doing poorly on an IQ test predicted doing well at some other task.",1212428766

We'll also assume that regular users don't mind the fact that their favorite search engine, social networking site, and torrent sites are unavailable.<p>3: For step 2 to occur as planned, all (or most) bandwidth providers will have to collude to make this a simultaneous change, and to agree not to go back and un-restrict the access to steal customers (here is where you should read up on the Prisoner's dilemma <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma</a>)<p>The market alternative to this is to simply raise prices on the bandwidth hogs and charge maybe on a per GB basis.

Multiple threads can assist greatly in speeding overall access to SQS, etc.<p>I also prefer the structure that Perl provides.  Coupled with the Catalyst framework and lots of module availability on CPAN, I'm happy with my choice for now.<p>Does anyone else have any feedback on my choice of Perl for its multi-threaded capability for use with AWS - I'd appreciate a sanity check :)",1212426497

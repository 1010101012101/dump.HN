Apple's transparent case for Macs was a brilliant idea - in fact one of the factors that brought them back to the market. That was too good and too easy to steal.

I want to bet the answer to both questions is ""no"" in which case at this point it is a probably a waste of his time to even think of her.<p>Back in '01 when my uncle was doing his startup, couple months before his site's launch we ran across a site that was VERY similar to what he was building. And here was a site that looked like it had been born out of my uncle's business plan. Few months later that site would fold--and we're still in business today.<p>Better question is HOW well is she doing what you planned to do. ",1177612617

17106,comment,16972,16972,0,0,nickb,,,"I read all the comments and can't believe no one gave you some  concrete advice. Sure, ideas are worthless until they are implemented but that does not JUSTIFY someone STEALING your idea and breaching the confidentiality! Just because you haven't implemented your idea fully, does NOT mean someone's JUSTIFIED to STEAL it!<p>Here's what you should do: expose her! That's right, start a blog, start the website for your idea and tell everyone how this person got the idea from you and breached the confidentiality. Post email exchange, provide a timeline of your conversaton with her, provide what you provided her with. Get it out in the sunlight. Investors and VCs will shun away from her since who wants to invest into a person that's a THIEF and invest into a company that might get sued by somoene (you)?! Startups have a low probability of success and these legal issues could just sink it. It's easier to invest into a ""clean"" startup.<p>Get the word out about her! Learn about SEO and work on getting your page to show up on the first page results when someone searches for her name. Talk to journalists (TC, GigaOM, etc) and get them to write about what happened to you. Expose her and get some publicity about your site in the process! Destroy her reputation! NEVER forget: in business, reputation is everything! Worst thing you can do is keep quiet about it.",1177611967

17104,comment,16740,16899,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I remember that essay, and my employer works a little like that (we have a platform that all of our products are built upon).  IMHO, it doesn't work quite as well as it sounds like it should.<p>Problem is, information is lost every time someone communicates their needs.  Customers don't actually need what they <i>say</i> they need; there's always some detail that they forgot to mention that only shows up when you watch them use the product.  That usually changes the tools that the programmers need, which often aren't the tools the programmers say they need, because programmers have their own preconceptions about how the solution should be implemented.  Someone who's only done JavaEE programming will likely say ""I need a tool that automates maintanance of my Hibernate and Spring configuration files"", when they really mean ""I need to store my user's session data between sessions.""<p>There's often a strong organizational pressure to use the output of the toolmakers, even if the tools aren't suitable for the job.  In my case, I'm not sure that I'd use our platform if just given our customer's requirements and my choice of toolset.  But I can't really say that, because it harms morale and makes me seem like a lone wolf who can't work with other people.  (Okay, I <i>have</i> said that, with the expected result.)<p>The nice thing about research labs is that nobody expects them to be useful.  Other programmers can pick up or drop their work based on whether it actually <i>is</i> useful, not by some corporate policy.  Unfortunately, the people most likely to pick up an interesting research lab project generally refuse to work for a big company.  So there's a long history of guys in garages ripping off the best ideas of corporate research departments, and eating the parent company in the process.<p>If I were managing a large, cash-rich corporation, I'd have a small exclave a mile or so away from the main campus.  It would have two buildings: a top-notch research lab, and an incubator (and a shared cafeteria, of course).  The research lab would be staffed with high-priced Ph.Ds and tenured professors, the best in their fields.  The incubator would be full of high school dropouts on grad student salaries, but with $40M+ stock grants contingent upon building something that millions of people will use.  All executives from the parent company would be prohibited from setting foot on this campus.<p>Come to think of it, this sounds a lot like grad school, but without the bullshit.",1177611886

At this point, it doesn't matter how long your description is, or how spiffy it sounds.  Just try to keep it to one paragraph, two at the most.  Then, start compressing it.

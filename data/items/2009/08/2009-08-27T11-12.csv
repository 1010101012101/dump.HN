789045,story,,,2,1,midnightmonster,"Ask HN: Cross-platform runtime for my project?",,"Web developer trying to do something (still web related) on the desktop.<p>I'm building an app in which I need to implement a desktop server portion (not http). It also needs a pretty GUI, mostly for providing tray/dock notifications and viewing web-type content, so probably something with a lightly-wrapped webkit reading local files or talking to an embedded HTTP server. It's important that my source code for the server portion not be utterly trivial to extract. It needs to run at least on OS X and Windows. I use Linux day-to-day myself, so I'd like to not leave myself out, but it seems very likely that paying customers will be more concentrated on the other two OSes.<p>I know PHP and JavaScript deeply. I have experience with Ruby and Python. I have experience with Java but I don't especially like it nor think my clients will appreciate the heavy runtime.<p>I was thinking of writing the server in PHP and using phc to compile it. Any better ideas or alternatives? There's py2exe, and I believe it would be possible to bundle all the necessary runtime with precompiled python files in a mac .app, but I expect python bytecodes are not very difficult to decompile.<p>For the GUI, there's AIR (ick: proprietary), XULRunner, and Titanium (crashes when trying to do much on my system) in the JavaScript-y space. What else should I look at? Remember that I need high-quality HTML/CSS/JavaScript rendering embedded. (Sort of? In a pinch, I could do notifications, config, and a list view in native-ish chrome and call the default browser to actually view the content. In this case the browser chrome would be no benefit, though, so I'd rather have this all together.)",1251374352

789030,comment,788393,788397,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Absolutely. While some of the other introductions to Prolog cover the language quite well (_Programming in Prolog_ by Clocksin & Mellish is good), _The Art of Prolog_ unapologetically dives headfirst into the deep ideas in logic programming, then comes back to the surface and shows how standard Prolog captures them. Its focus on the big ideas ties it less to Prolog, and it sits very comfortably next to books such as SICP and CTM.<p>It's out of print and a bit expensive ($80-130ish), but the first edition goes for much cheaper. Prolog standardized between the two editions, and the second edition has 100+ pages of new material (including projects), but the former (closer to $6) will give you a pretty good taste.",1251373409

A similar tack in a real life argument would be someone saying, ""Why are you getting so worked up and making such a big deal out of this?""<p>It makes responding a delicate thing - about the only choices are to directly point it out, or high ground/bow out.

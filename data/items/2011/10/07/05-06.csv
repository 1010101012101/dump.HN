I spent a lot of time on the phone with the 'security team' and nothing ever came of it. In the end, I kept receiving all of this person's banking information.<p>It wasn't so much a security problem so much as it was annoying to get this person's banking info all the time. (I assume I would have needed more than access to email to get into his account.)<p>In the end, after several phone calls and then tweeting at Wells Fargo, it was the Facebook reps that were able to get someone to call me and sort the problem out. The rep who called even verified that the first three of my social didn't match the account holder, so it wasn't identity theft.<p>Completely annoying but in the end, it just took finding that one person that understood and cared to help.",1317967016

You will find most stereotypes about Americans being false. US is a big country, just California will feel bigger than all of Turkey. There are more options here for everything than anywhere in the world. Here customer is king. People dress less formal usually. Your instincts will develop with your stay but find a network of trusted people here so you can run major decisions by them. You will also find Americans to be more open to radical ideas about life, technology, and world view. Being self reliant is expected.",1317967012

No, they are art. Enjoyment and appreciation of art is a matter of personal taste, which is not, will not, and cannot be universal for everyone.<p>That's why up/down votes are decent enough ratings systems despite their crudeness, all they do is tell people whether or not taking the effort to find out if a piece of art suits your personal taste is likely to be worthwhile.<p>Ultimately what ratings are trying to get at is recommendations. The simplest idea being to measure the average opinion of everyone and present the highest rated works as recommendations. However, more sophisticated systems which try to find people with similar taste and recommend to you things that they seem to like but you haven't been exposed to are likely to be more successful, though significantly more complex to implement. It seems unlikely that even that represents the limit of improvement for the problem, but nobody's done much better yet.",1317966382
3082813,comment,3081696,3082698,2,0,vacri,,,"Yes, I owned several MP3 players of the era, one of them an iPod video. I found the ipod <i>at the time</i> to be one of the most frustrating to load media onto - as one memorable example, it wouldn't let me load .mp4s into the 'TV' folder, because .mp4s are 'Movies'. No argument will be entered into. wtf?<p>Loading music was no better or worse than other players I had, but iTunes was still horrendous bloatware. Why do I need to install <i>Quicktime</i> - absolutely and utterly useless to me - to simply move files from hard drive to ipod?! Some MP3 players I had just let you drag and drop with a file explorer and they would 'just work', plus you could use the software to do it 'properly' if you felt like. One chinese knock-off I had simply played the songs in the order you copied them on, which was weird :) Then there's things like radios - ipod had none, despite it being a clear feature people wanted for years.<p>But yes, I had several MP3 players of the era, and the ipod was nothing special in terms of user experience. The hardware case was pretty, admittedly.<p>People are viewing the early digital music player market with the rosy-coloured glasses of historical revisionism. Apple are top dog now, so it somehow stands to reason they always were? Logical fallacy. The early ipods weren't great, and it wasn't Apple out there leading us all into the digital music new world, there was a passel of competitors.<p>I think you also underestimate marketing - higher market share does not mean that the product is inherently better (betamax vs VHS, anyone? Or the OS war of your choice?). Apple has an incredible marketing team, and frankly good marketing does mean something significant, or there wouldn't be so much money in it.",1317966354

3082758,comment,3082241,3082241,2,0,wernercolangelo,,,"Discolsure: I am a co-founder for a movie recommendation site called tellmetwin.com so I am biased towards our own rating system...<p>I have never considered the rewatchability criteria as a potential factor in rating a movie, but must admit that is has appeal. But thinking about it further, it is a very personal metric so would not be very useful in determining the overall watchability of a movie. I.e. if you consider a movie rewatchable it might not correlate with me considering it to be watchable.<p>I would love to be able to see a plot of individuals and how their ratings cluster (some interesting visual way of adding and removing individuals would be cool) because I would guess (based on our own data) that these plots would not be uniform. And if they are not, then an individual's movie recommendation, based on rewatchability, would have less value to me.",1317964764

3082750,comment,3082241,3082501,2,0,natesm,,,"I think a problem with ""rewatchability"" is that it can vary drastically with the amount of viewings. I'm going to substitute <i>Aliens</i> for <i>Transformers</i>, because ""watchable"" is not a word I would use to describe <i>Transformers</i>.<p><i>Aliens</i> is very rewatchable. It has tense but predictable action (the aliens kill everyone, ""get away from her"", etc.). Sure, it's best the first time, but <i>Aliens</i> only ceases to be rewatchable when you get tired of watching <i>Aliens</i>.<p>Films like <i>Primer</i>, <i>Fight Club</i>, and <i>The Usual Suspects</i>,  are very rewatchable once, with a sharp decline afterwards. The Soze/Durden effect is incredible once. The next time, you want to watch very closely to catch all of the obvious hints that you missed. You might still miss some, but not many. By the fourth time, it's almost pointless.",1317964504

Developers can make assumptions about the width and height of the screen. And widths and heights are described, believe it or not, with floats, not ints. They've been able to maintain compatibility between devices because they've doubled the resolution every time they wanted to increase it. This has in some sense made life easier for developers, while it's allowed Apple to not build the UI abstractions that Android had to. It seems fundamentally unsustainable though, surely they can't keep doubling forever?",1317963724

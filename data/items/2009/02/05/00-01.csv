Add mesh networking and you can actually wire-up whole cities with 20 bucks devices. This is soo cool.<p>Ok, I'm not saying this is what it does. For what we know, it could be completely crap. But, just imagine:<p>- You have 30 dollar box - so you can put about as much brain-power in it as a router.<p>- For really poor countries, LCD screens are a waste when you have TV. So, you just throw in a TV-out, which was cheap 20 years ago.<p>- From my experience in wiring relatively ""wild"" places, if you have boxes plugged in a power socket, the people will put the actual wire the place themselves. That's if you don't have OLPC's mesh networking.<p>This stupid-looking white box could do most for developing countries then anything else in the last 10 years.

As long as there are enough resources to go around, there isn't a big problem, especially since people are resources themselves.<p>(If this weren't the case, you would think that evolution would drive us to die shortly after we had children, or at least after we lost our ability to have children.)",1233795422

466857,comment,466485,466780,0,0,robotrout,,,"You're right that aging seems to have an evolutionary advantage.  That advantage is increased diversity within a species.  Super successful individuals, who would otherwise ""take over"" a species, are replaced, so that other strains can get a chance.  Diversity in a species is as important as diversity in a stock portfolio.  What's working great today, may not work great tomorrow, so portfolios and species that survive plagues, asteroids, and global warming fanatics tend to be diversified.<p>However....<p>I contend that the human race has moved beyond evolution.  No longer do only the fittest survive.  We protect our weak and stupid, and they mate just as frequently and successfully as our strong and smart.  We've wrestled the destiny of our species away from evolution, and taken control of it ourselves.<p>Now, how that experiment turns out, it's too early to tell.  So far, so good.  But since the ship has already sailed anyway, any argument that something is ""against evolution"" is a moot argument.<p>I would like to live for longer than 100 years myself, so I admit to being a bit biased on this issue.  I think a case can be made that the ""best and the brightest"" of our current governing and business class could use some augmentation.  We've had some great leaders in our past, it might be nice if they were still active.  Closer to our hearts here, what if we still had Richard Feynman?  What if we still had Arthur C Clarke?  Wouldn't the world probably be better?  We are not so brimming with extra talent that we can just throw it away after a few decades.",1233795356

I believe you understood my meaning, however.<p>There is a difference in preventing death and eliminating it (or extending life in such a way that the same side effects are achieved). While I certainly don't have all the answers, I can't help but be struck by the rather narcissistic and frankly immature tone that dominates the debate, particularly with those in favour of enhanced exploration.<p>Perhaps it is because of this attitude, and not the life extension itself that I find myself put off.  The human condition is what it is primarily because of death. We can't possibly accept that we can remove death and not significantly alter what it means to be human. While that might not be an issue, and may even be desired, that's not what we discuss; in fact it is often dismissed.",1233795235

It's fine if you need to write a few dozen lines once a week or something, but if you code any more than that, I'd suggest learning a more advanced editor. Don't limit yourself to pico or nano.

It's worth the few weeks to learn (and few years to learn well).<p>I've used both, though seem to be a bit quicker in Vi - try evim (easy vim) if you're not comfortable with jumping right in.",1233792863

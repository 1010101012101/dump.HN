Drug patents are 20 years, so the peasants would be getting 20-year-old cancer treatments, while the select few would be getting actual modern medicine.  Besides the ethics, though, what would the cost of modern medicines be for those few thousand who can actually afford them?  Today, plenty of middle-class people get modern drugs because their insurance pays for it, so the cost of research, clinical trials, manufacturing, etc is distributed among a large population.

If each optical receptor had a narrow acceptance window (the way that individual atoms absorb), there would be gaps in the rainbow. Remember that ALL of the colours you see in a rainbow are pure, composed entirely of photons of a particular wavelength proper to each of those colours. It's not RGB; it's not CMYK.<p>We can, to an extent, simulate a full spectrum through additive and subtractive colour mixing of ""primaries"", but it is only a simulation. (And Edwin Land demonstrated that we don't actually need all three of R, G and B in order to create the illusion of a full-colour picture with only a comparatively tiny gamut loss. It is a fragile thing, though, and requires the integrative function and cognitive mapping of our brains.<p>Similarly, we can easily tell the difference between full-spectrum lighting and discontinuous spectrum lighting. Discontinuous spectrum lighting makes us uncomfortable. None of the colours looks quite right. Food is unappetizing, pictures and people less attractive. Did the light-makers just miss the right mix of frequencies by a hair? No -- any scheme that relies on a small number of discreet wwavelengths will cause a similar discomfort.

Facebook Connect is a simple way to use Facebook ID and connect to other non-Facebook websites, and then if you want, send those interactions back to your Facebook page. For instance, if you logged into GigaOM and left a comment using Facebook Connect, you can tell your friends that you did so.</i><p>While a single point to get identity/authentication from is nice, and Facebook is poised to pull it off (despite that I'd personally prefer something more open, portable and federated) more so that previous big contenders in this area (MS Passport comes to mind), I think the jury is still out on if this -- tell your friends you did something, like posted a comment -- is a valid use case, no matter how many people keep bringing that up as one of the possible <i>future</i> powers of Facebook.<p>While my Facebook network is relatively small and is composed mainly of people I've met in real life and have a relationship with that is not solely on-line, the actual interaction I get on Facebook for my ""internet actions"" (all imported via Facebook/Friendfeed integration), and the interaction I see other people get on Facebook for things they've posted (mostly directly posted, since few people use Friendfeed and the Friendfeed Facebook app), is extremely minimal.  Admittedly, this could be because my network is, in general, boring.  I think there are two core reasons the interaction is minimal.<p>First, the <i>majority</i> of anyone's network is not going to actually cares that someone made a comment on GigaOM.  If they did, they'd be on GigaOM, not on Facebook.  And if they're on/frequent GigaOM because they are interested in the content there, there's no reason to do their GigaOM-centric interaction anywhere else.<p>Secondly, Facebook being a proxy for reporting on all internet (or real-life) activity adds a layer of indirection but doesn't add significant value.  There's no incentive to move a conversation that already exists on GigaOM to a Facebook comment thread.  I've been disappointed that a lot of Facebook interaction (for what I've observed) has been of the ""me too"" variety.  The ability to click through and view the original source of the content is too easy: the Internet itself is already federated (AOL and Compuserve tried that with their own walled gardens).<p>So Facebook can be a clearing house for activity, but I think it'll end up being a jumping off point, which in itself has significant value from the standpoint of aggregation (this is the main use of Friendfeed, in fact).  But there a lot of other players in the aggregated content market that focus more on the user generating the content than on the consumers (tumblr, posterous), which are even easer to access than Facebook, since you don't <i>need</i> an account on a single site to consume them and the <i>entire</i> content is available on the original site.

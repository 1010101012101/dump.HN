So your batching related inserts to cut down on the per-transaction overhead, but not actually returning anything to the client until the commit is confirmed.<p>I think this is a good method, as long as you're careful about these things. (I assume you've taken care of them, just talking about this method in general).<p>1) If there were multiple transactions in the web request, previously the second ones likely wouldn't have been run if the first were to fail. This would likely change that and it could even necessitate having rollback for the second transaction.<p>2) Now there is a potential ""thundering herd"" problem. When the transaction batch commit notification is received, all 1000 web requests made over that 100 ms period become ready to execute and start competing for network/disk/database resources <i>simultaneously</i>. A disk that was just sitting idle now has 1000 different things to do at once. If everybody hits the network at once it can cause temporary packet loss. When packets are lost, connections can be dropped or delayed by retransmits. Sometimes client retries and retransmits can happen synchronously.

Their strategy, which is brilliant, is to only go after the biggest, most well-known clients (I know nothing groundbreaking, but it works).  They say they only focus on whales, academics, and children (hospitals).  Due to this, they have been able to capture 265 of the most prestigious hospitals in the country (and soon in the world).  With the lock-in they have, I can't see them giving up this market.  It would take a lot to justify replacing that half a billion dollar system for someone else, especially after the hell the administrators have gone through to get the systems up in the first place.  Also, in many ways Epic is becoming the de-facto standard, which is leading to network effects that would have to be broken down.  I don't think you can fight Epic at their game and win.<p>Added to that they will likely begin to move downstream (recently heard a rev. projection $8.4B in 2016, up from $1.2B today) as the mid-size players would love to have an Epic install if only to mimic the respected healthcare organizations.<p>The most secure place from Epic is the small practices.  The IT/intemplmentation/costs requirements of Epic are far too high, in its current form, to sell to them.  The problem becomes selling.

The real power of protocols comes when you use them to decouple this.<p>Here's an example (in Clojure because I don't know the names of the types Clojurescript uses off the top of my head, but the ideas are the same):<p><pre><code>    (defprotocol Sliceable\n      (slice [this start end]))\n\n    (extend-protocol Sliceable\n      clojure.lang.PersistentVector\n      (slice [this start end]\n        (subvec this start end)))\n\n    (extend-protocol Sliceable\n      java.lang.String\n      (slice [this start end]\n        (.substring this start end)))\n\n    (slice ""Hello"" 0 2)\n    (slice [:a :b :c] 0 2)\n</code></pre>\nHere we've defined a protocol called ""Sliceable"" and added support for it to two <i>built-in</i> classes.  We've done so in a safe way -- the ""slice"" function isn't visible anywhere outside this namespace unless you import it.<p>Now say you come along and want to use my little ""slicing"" library to carve up <i>someone else's</i> data structures.  You can add support without touching my files or their files:<p><pre><code>    (ns foo\n      (:use fancylists [:only (FancyList)])\n      (:use stevelosh.slicing [:only (Sliceable)]))\n\n    (extend-protocol Sliceable\n        FancyList\n        (slice [this start end]\n          (... slice up the fancylist here ...)))\n</code></pre>\nAnd now in another file you want to slice up a FancyList:<p><pre><code>    (ns bar\n      (:use fancylists [:only (FancyList)])\n      (:use stevelosh.slicing [:only (slice)]))\n\n    (def my-fancy-list (FancyList 1 2 ""cat"" ""dog""))\n\n    (slice my-fancy-list 2 4)\n    ; => (a FancyList containing ""cat"" and ""dog"")\n</code></pre>\nNow you've added support for some random person's FancyList library to my Slicing library, without touching the code in either of them.  This is the really cool part about Protocols.<p>This concept actually does appear in David's post when he adds support for his Slice type to the IFn protocol, but it's a bit obscured by the fact that function calling has some syntactic sugar so you don't have to write -invoke.",1327610208

I found that I could very easily purchase TVs for $100-$200 less than what I could sell them for.<p>It was fun, and I've seriously considered doing it on weekends again, however now that I live in a large city (Atlanta) I feel like there is a lot more research that has to go into an item... Mostly because people from an hour a way from the city center will claim they are within the city and so on. In college I was in a city of 150k people, and could get to the outer ""suburbs"" in at most 30 minutes.<p>My current TV was one of the first 1080P 50"" Plasmas... It still works perfectly and looks great. I bought it from a couple for $750. (Bought with the profits from selling buying and selling TVs)",1327608006

This guy was clearly in a bad situation when he started and being a ""wheeler dealer parasite"" provided for his family that needed the money.<p>How is this worse than someone who needs the item getting it for free?",1327608004

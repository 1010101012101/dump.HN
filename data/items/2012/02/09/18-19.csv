They already have the range of gas-powered cars (~300 miles for the S), but once you hit that, you're stuck.  It makes long-distance trips onerous, if not impossible.<p>Anyway, they're getting cheaper all the time, batteries are getting better, and when you can convincingly pitch the TCO as being less than a gas car, you'll start to see people jump on it.  Infrastructure will follow from there.",1328813969

3572262,comment,3571027,3571938,1,0,MatthewPhillips,,,"> More accurately, when the feature is standardized most browsers recognize both the the prefixed and unprefixed versions. This is still a significant competitive advantage for Webkit since there will be a lot of legacy content out there that uses only the -webkit prefixed name. This situation is an incentive for Webkit contributors Apple and Google to delay disclosure and standardization of these features as long as possible, and the W3C discussion above indicates they are doing just that.<p>I think you're misattributing malice here. This isn't a WebKit only issue, this is a first-to-market issue. When some new css or js feature is proposed and vendors implement it with the prefix, some developers rush to hack on it, submit their demos to HN, and then forget about it weeks later. They don't bother to go back and update the css later with other prefixes.<p>The same issue exists when WebKit isn't the first to market. WebKit doesn't support calc() yet. Mozilla does. Plenty of abandoned webpages will never be updated with other prefixes.  But are these serious websites/businesses?  Is Facebook or Twitter sticking in -webkit and never bothering to go back?<p>>Once something is available to the public, developers will use it and often with good reason. That's where prefixes are most destructive. If Chrome comes out with a -webkit-sparkle property tomorrow, advocates of prefixes would have you add -moz-sparkle, -o-sparkle, -ms-sparkle, and plain old sparkle immediately just in case it becomes a standard. Nuts! It would be better for non-Webkit browsers if we just started with plain old sparkle so that legacy content would not be forever broken to them.<p>Legacy content would still be broken because sparkle will likely be changed in the process of standardization. IndexedDB has seen some dramatic changes in the course of its development; all those sites that implemented an earlier version will be broken when the standard is finalized. The vendor prefix sends a warning to the developers.<p>Browser sniffing is a far bigger problem than vendor prefixes.  Google is one of the worst offenders, especially in mobile where they send UAs not equal to iOS or Android to some poorer version.",1328811704

Whereas when at the board in an interview one person knows the ""answer"" and is across the table testing the other.

If you're asking what I think the average Joe should do (someone with limited time and skill when it comes to money management), I'll give you Z advice. A lot of it depends on how hard you're willing to work to protect and grow your wealth.<p>If the market is near 13k like it is today, with corporate profit margins at all time highs (cyclically impossible that they'll stay up there), I'd say you should be out of the market. Corporations are accumulating debt at the fastest pace in history (which is one of the reasons they're also hoarding cash, as an offset). When rates spike higher as they eventually must, those companies will get demolished. Far better to wait for the next plunge and be opportunistic, than to hope for a few more points on top of this already huge several year run. Buffett's mantra works very well in that case: be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy.<p>Buy gold on big drops, like when it fell from $1900x to $1530x recently; but never chase it when it runs. Keep it a modest part of your portfolio (10% to 25% depending on your particularly preferences). It's not a growth vehicle, it's a wealth protection device.<p>Corporate debt is a great place to get good yield right now, but again you have to know what you're buying.<p>It's perfectly fine to take an annual hit on inflation against liquid dollars (granted that's under, say, 10%); better to have opportunity cash available. Typically people miss big opportunities because of a lack of cash. Really big opportunities are not that rare, they come around every 3 to 5 years, and the returns you can make off of them are extraordinary. You buy the Dow at 7,000 when everybody else is writhing in pain from the ride down from 14k.<p>Own commodities when they're occasionally cheap. For example, when potash crashed during the global implosion a few years ago, you could have purchased stocks like POT for 80% off. When oil was $10 or $12 circa the late 1990s, the common 'wisdom' was that oil was dead, a terrible investment, and so on. In reality, <i>cheap</i> energy is almost never a terrible long term invest. The human desire / need for cheap energy will continue to be infinite, which ensures that prices will swing up at some point (even if it takes several years).<p>Right now, I'd tell most people to look around themselves and invest there. Get a strategically better education perhaps; or find a good business to purchase or invest into. Something you can directly apply your sweat equity to with multiplication potential. Shield your wealth until you find the right opportunities; people seem to often undervalue patience. You don't need lots of homeruns, you need very few.<p>In this environment, it's all about having liquidity to be opportunistic. The volatility in the global economy is almost guaranteed to produce wild swings over time. When people panic, be there with your cash.",1328810682

Thanks for sharing and helping others!<p>However, I would say, that for 4kb (minified), sisyphus offers a lot of functionality - and is supposedly cross-browser compatible. If you want to limit it to textareas only, it's not much of a modification.<p>Anyway, just thought I'd point out an alternative, and thanks again for sharing your work!",1328810424

It's surprising how easy it is to be told you need it and often when you're dealing with certain agencies it's easier for them to make sure you get it so that if they say the wrong thing then they're covered by your arrangements too.",1328810409

I have several sites on various platforms, and I'm currently running over 160K visits per month across all of them. It's not unusual to have 10K visitors from HN drop by on any given day. I haven't had any problem with WP. Of course, I don't really check it. It just works.<p>I hate to sound non-caring, but is it really a problem if ten people come by your blog at 3am and can't load the site up? They'll be back at 4am, and the site will be fine then. Do you really need 99.999 uptime on a <i>blog</i>? It's all a numbers game. If you lose 2% of visitors due to technical problems it shouldn't be a huge deal. Just take a look at your funnel and conversion numbers and do the math. There's no way that damage is going to come out to $2500 per year.<p>On a personal note, what I find is that there are a huge number of opportunities for my startups to accrue costs that don't justify the benefit. It's tough figuring out what to spend money on. Things like hosting or tools have to pull their own weight.<p>ADD: There are a lot of companies that made huge amounts of money leveraging free blogging services. Not my cup of tea, but it does provide a bit of context.",1328810400

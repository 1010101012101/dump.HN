Now throw in great Skype integration and Office support and they could have a good business phone. But if the phone doesn't have Dropbox, Pandora, and dozens of other high-profile apps users are already using on other platforms, that's a hard sell to anyone outside of IT departments.<p>I think there's also a window to build a decent consumer phone with great XBox integration. Make the phone essentially compete with Wii U and have great stand-alone mobile games too. That could be a great phone for twittering teens.

For a simple Rails app, setting up Ubuntu an RDBMS and Redis is trivial, thats true.<p>The point is that managing 5 Rails apps, one on Mysql, two on Postgres, two on CouchDB, one with Redis, one with Memcached... (and so on so forth) gets non-trivial soon if you don't grow beyond managing it all on your development machine.[1] Suddenly, all that trivial development stuff becomes a question of configuration management.<p>What the Ruby community understands is that trivial things can pile up into something non-trivial. This is why Heroku solves a trivial problem (deploying a process on some defined environment using git) and takes it to a big scale. Github does the same for repositories (arguably one of the ""trivial"" tasks for sysadmins) and provides it for a good amount of money. All those services started in the Ruby community for a reason.

Oh, and they will because they'll feel comfortable with Windows, especially if they are told ""Oh btw, you can have Windows on your phone and tablet as well as Office now, why bother with whatever Android is or that Apple stuff.""<p>Its also a little silly to expect MS to not try to compete in these areas. Their Win8/Tablet strategy is big and risky and may or may not pay off, but conceding that realm to Apple and Google seems foolish.

There is certainly no discussion of any conversations with actual scammers to see if that is the reason they do what they do or what they are thinking. And as far as copycat crimes go, it would make sense that someone would mimick an existing ubiquitous scheme rather than coming up with an entirely new and unique location in the world. Most people who kill themselves of course choose a method that they've heard other people use and it is well known that there are crime waves that start with a single incident. Lastly there is no data available to show what happens if you don't choose nigeria as your location to back any of this highly academic analysis up.<p>Of course this paper and analysis could be used with many things. Take dating for example. Is it better to go on a first date dressed to the nines or dressed at 70% (arbitrarily picked to prove a point) your best dressed look? I could take that and get someone to write a paper which shows that you have a higher chance of getting married if you dress at 70% on your first date since you will weed out many people that aren't attracted to your average looks.  But the fact that I can present an academic paper showing that doesn't make the fact true without something more to back it up.",1340214876

4138085,comment,4133686,4134838,2,0,jordo37,,,"A different opinion from a UVA alum:
The ""revolt"" of the faculty is partially due to the Board wanting to close marginal academic departments because they can't pay for themselves, like Classics (which studies Greek and Latin texts from the founding of Western Civ.) I was not a Classics major and in fact never took a Classics class but many of my friends who are lawyers today were and universities want students like this. Everyone understands that cuts need to be made, but the board seems to fail to understand that making cuts at a university is different than cost-saving measures at a corporation.<p>Beyond this one issue, the faculty is also responding like this because the Board is acting silently, secretively and hastily in making decisions for the university with little to no participation from faculty or administrators, or even information being provided. At this point, after a week of intense scrutiny and questioning, still no one outside the Board knows exactly why President Sullivan was let go.<p>In 2003 UVA passed a milestone in that more money came from private donors than public funds. Today UVA's budget includes only 8% being covered by the state. The cuts from the state are very real and very keenly felt. UVA is on a tricky path to become a true hybrid private/public school and the questions facing the faculty and the Board are not whether this should happen, but how.<p>Furthermore, to rebut some of your points
a) It's not insane to have 3300 faculty when many of those are working directly on research or employed at the medical center. (I believe this to be the case given that on average  about 1000 faculty are employed through the medical center <a href=""http://www.web.virginia.edu/iaas/data_catalog/institutional/data_digest/emp_fac_rank.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.web.virginia.edu/iaas/data_catalog/institutional/...</a>)
b) The expenditures have increased in an attempt at keeping close with peer institutions for salary and other options. Realistically, despite these attempts the faculty at UVA could easily head to competitive private or public schools and make more money, and will probably be doing so in massive numbers over the next few years following this fiasco.
c) I am not sure where you are basing your correlation that this faculty growth has happened at the expense of students. If it has been driven by the growth of costs at the Medical Center that is a source of income as well. If it's been driven by academic faculty then its either been funding research to increase the number of accolades achieved by our faculty (thereby increasing the ranking of the school) or it has been hiring more professors or paying teaching faculty more to keep them from leaving, which would seem to directly benefit students.",1340213885

The only benefits I can see (technically) from staying at a company for more than a year or so would be greater domain knowledge and perhaps a greater understanding of the long-term implications of architectural decisions.<p>As for technical depth in terms of skill, IME I've found that job-hopping has dramatically increased the speed at which I've been able to gain expertise. For example, I've worked at some places where, for cultural reasons, there's no call to do fat-client javascript applications, with more of a focus on server-side technologies like stored procedures. Conversely, where the front-end stuff was more important, I got much better at organizing large javascript codebases and creating web services to interact with them. Had I worked at only one or the other, I would have lacked technical depth in the area I was missing out on.<p><i>Candidate displayed a superiority complex or sense of entitlement</i> -<p>Guilty as charged! Unless I'm being hired as a consultant, I generally tend to wrap-up interviews when I realize the technical staff I'd be reporting to don't have as much technical ability as I do (for my own, entirely subjective measure of technical ability). Also, I don't work with PHP, Java or anything related to Microsoft.<p>I'll also disqualify companies where I feel like they have bad process, or if there's any social weirdness in the interview (I've experienced everything from off-the-cuff anti-Semitism to the interviewers shouting at each other). I don't mind a flexible work schedule, i.e. I work late on a Tuesday and then I go home early on a Wednesday, but overtime without pay is not an option.<p><i>Candidate talked more about the accomplishments of co-workers</i> -<p>Programming of any significance is a team sport. Sometimes a potential hirer will ask ""Do you have any experience with problem X?"" and my answer is often ""Yes, alongside other developers"" or ""Not directly, but I was involved in discussions about X when we were dealing with it at #{company_name}"" or even ""No, but I was talking about X with #{someone} at #{some_tech_meetup} and he said they were trying #{some_solution} which sounded like a sensible strategy. I think it's probably better than #{other_solution} because it means that #{benefit_of_first_solution}"".<p>As long as I discussed some of the tradeoffs of various options and managed to adequately demonstrate my understanding of the technology, I think the interviewers were happy. I feel somewhat uncomfortable taking <i>full</i> responsibility for achievements at any company I work at, because in practice it involves mulling over ideas, discussing pros and cons and coming to a solution together.",1340213751

We pay roughly 2USD per liter fuel. That implies that people are actually trying to buy fuel efficient cars. We don't drive pickups - in fact, I couldn't really afford the fuel cost if I would.

I am assuming you do not have any real world experience yet other than internships possibly. In that case, anything over 1 page is overkill in your case.
In general, 2-3 pages is max. that a Resume should have. Anything over that, it is pointless. 
I suggest you keep your 1 pager resume and another doc. where you list your projects/experience in detail. If anyone is interested, you can share your detailed doc. in addition to your 1 pager Resume/CV<p>EDIT: since the OP has clarified his experience, I did not mean to insult his experience earlier. But like i said, for recent graduates, usually 1 pager is good enough in the US at least. It could be different for other countries. For example, I know that in India, people even add their date of birth etc. on their Resume/CV which is actually not required/recommended in the US.",1340213032

In contrast, going off on fun-but-useless tangents to fill up a bunch of time is easy, as is using a bunch of examples or other exposition.<p>To compare, in the world of essays, it is well known among undergraduates that there are simple tricks to make an essay as long as required. However, it requires actually knowing what you are doing to make an essay that is short but still dense.<p>So, to now be more explicit: if the slides are not auto-advancing, it does not help the timing problem. If anything, it just lulls people into a false sense of complacency. I have thereby heard Ignite talks described as ""convention over configuration"" for talks.<p>The problem is that if you screw up even once, and have to restart a thought or argument, realize your audience needs an extra example to make something clear, or simply forget a point an have to fill it in later, you are screwed.<p>In an hour long format, there is probably something later on in your talk that you can cut or shorten to make up the time. You often don't even need to do that, as Q&A is often expected to be included in the time, so you have a massive buffer to heal mistakes (in either direction).",1340213030

He did that after being repeatedly warned by the court not to deliver more filings. He did that while one of his previous filings was currently being considered; instead of waiting for a response for the court, he continued to send them additional filings. Here, I'll just let the Florida Supreme Court describe it:<p><pre><code>    Thompson has submitted over fifty filings directly with this Court, all of 
    which have either been forwarded to the referee, dismissed, or denied.  
    Additionally, Thompsons most recent filings are repetitive, frivolous, and, like his 
    earlier ones, insulting to the Court.  One of Thompsons recent filings contains 
    what Thompson refers to as a childrens picture book for adults that rehashes his 
    previous arguments in illustrated form which he states was necessary due to the 
    Courts inability to comprehend his arguments.  Between the text of the motion, 
    Thompson pasted images depicting swastikas, kangaroos in court, a reproduced 
    dollar bill, cartoon squirrels, Paul Simon, Paul Newman, Ray Charles, a handprint 
    with the word ""SLAP!"" written under it, Bar Governor Benedict P. Kuehne, a 
    baby, Ed Bradley, Jack Nicholson, Justice Clarence Thomas, Julius Caesar, keys, 
    and a house of cards, and the motion concludes with a photograph of the 
    cover of Thompsons book, Out of Harm's Way.

If neither player is outsizedly profitable nor has garnered sizeable market share, the only guiding reason for the merger is to eliminate competition. If your competition thinks it is stronger than you it will balk (you're both startups) - thus, you in the best case is teaming up with someone as good as you.<p>Startups should be focused on building value, not wiping out local competition.

Being a worthy candidate with less skills is a possibility - perhaps you will work harder or longer than they will, which could make you more productive.  I would say that many companies may hire someone like you over someone with a bit more experience and less passion, as the long term investment is potentially better.  If it were a 6 week contract, I'll take the other guy - for a salaried perm job, you may be a better choice.",1340211613

1) web-based management of s3 is lacking and thus hard to use (e.g., you can't limit Frank to use only 5GB and Sarah to have 9GB)
2) s3 provides a ""never ending"" supply of centralized online storage
3) but users are not familiar with s3, but know ftp and have ftp clients<p>Thoughts?",1182819034

They must learn to communicate with people who are less sophisticated then they are without being condescending.<p>I was (shockingly) successful at selling for 3 simple reasons.<p>1 - I know what I'm talking about.
2 - I tell the truth.
3 - I don't care what other people think of me.<p>If you can share ideas well, and have prior three traits, you'll stand out. The biggest issue I had was confusion about what selling is. Selling is not 3 martini lunches at strip clubs, or schmoozing with execs. Selling is about sharing a story about how you can (or even more important, cannot) help a person/company solve a problem.<p>Note, this is a rather different type of selling than so called cold-calling (I can't imagine a more perfect personal hell, than doing that).",1182818153

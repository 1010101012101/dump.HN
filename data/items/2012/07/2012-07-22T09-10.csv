Berlin is cheap, affordable, has an international culture (I'm an emmigrant) and pretty much something to offer to everyone, so the city itself just has a good attraction for young people.<p>I don't know why the startup scene has started booming here but just type in ""web start-up"" at indeed (<a href=""http://www.indeed.de/Jobs?q=web+start-up&l=berlin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indeed.de/Jobs?q=web+start-up&l=berlin</a>) and you'll get 275 results. Plus the UK has cracked down on emmigration laws and Germany has opened them up, at least for engineers, etc. b/c of the ""Fachkrftemangel"" i.e. the fact that the Germans lack skilled laborers. So whereas before for Europeans and especially Eastern europeans the UK was #1 its now changing b/c Germany is closer and easier. Also Germany seems more open to Europeans period, the UK with Cameron is doing all it can to shun the rest of Europe. The only problem I see, is that you still need to know German to get around (  which no one studies in school), which for instance is why my brother hasn't come.<p>EDIT: I guess I exaggerated with the ""no one studies in school"" bit. My point is that english is the only language we are all pounded into learning regardless of whether or not we have an interest in languages or a talent for them, so we can at least function at some level with english. German, however, is not the lingua franca I think we can all agree on that. I'm quadlingual (if that's a word), but not all talented developers like languages as well and unfortunately whatever the germans say, you still need to know german if you want to assimilate in germany, get an apartment, go shopping, and live life.",1342950941

4276871,comment,4276691,4276691,4,0,flexie,,,"Debating whether patents are good without differentiating on industries seems wrong to me. I've been involved in investments in pharmaceutical companies and investments in IT companies. Those are two completely different worlds.<p>In the pharmaceutical world founders and employees more often have large opportunity costs by starting or joining a new venture. They are usually in their 30s or 40s with huge student loans, mortgage and kids. They forgo high incomes if they join a start-up. The road to the market is much longer (often more than 10 years). Investment in machinery is also at a completely different level. Drug development usually entails million dollar investment in specialized equipment. Perhaps the most costly aspect of drug development is the regulatory obstacles, such as getting approvals.<p>In contrast, IT companies are cheap. Founders often have little formal education (Microsoft, Facebook, Skype) and the road to market is much shorter. IT start-ups expect customers (or at least users) in a matter of weeks or months. Many IT companies can get to proof of concept with almost no investment in equipment. The founders simply bring their laptops on board). Regulatory concerns, if any, can usually be dealt with by one lawyer in a few days.<p>I cannot imagine anyone investing hundreds of millions of dollars in drug development over the course of 10 years without some assurance that competitors can't ""steal"" their idea. Usually that assurance is a patent or a trade secret. But keeping secrets over 10 years with employees coming and going - that's difficult.<p>tl;dr: Once you have an idea about, say a shopping cart in a web store, it can be implemented in a few man-weeks.

It <i>isn't</i>, but is  only one input (essentially defining the demand curve, and setting a possible upper limit), but the true market pay scale being one that would also have to take into consideration supply.  As I noted (somewhat snarkily), market conditions for establishing executive pay fall somewhat short of the free market definition.  For a more popular treatment, Eddie Murphey and Dan Akroyd's ""Trading Places"" explores a similar idea.  Mark Lewis's writings on the stock market provide some insight on trader qualifications and pay.<p>A friend some years ago provided an intriguing argument for why financial traders' pay was as high as it was.  It was less a conventional market pricing argument than one of creating incentives to minimize incentives for fraud.  Essentially:  we're going to pay you so goddamned much money that you'd be completely mental to try to cheat on us and lose out.<p>I really cannot speak to the merits of this.<p>What that, and numerous other arguments for the rich getting ever richer <i>do</i> suggest is that there is a class of people who are very well versed at rationalizing their income and remuneration rates.<p>There's also a great deal of very, very, very sloppy thinking, rationalization, reportage, etc., in economic matters.<p>I'm also coming to feel that much of economics as it's been taught for the past 150 years or so simply isn't so. That the conditions described by free markets are far less common and far more fragile than commonly believed.  That much of macroeconomics is bunkum used, again, to rationalize why them that has gets more (though, oddly, I'm also coming to understand money, fiscal policy, and Keynesian theory better than ever before), and that much of the economic gain is really a <i>power</i> game played for leverage and advantage, rather than for strict financial gain.  A lens which makes the MPAA/RIAA, copyright, patent, trade and immigration law, etc., far more understandable.<p>Jonathen Nitzan's <i>Capital as Power</i> seems to have stumbled on this same insight: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Capital-Power-Creorder-Political-Economy/dp/0415477190"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Capital-Power-Creorder-Political-Econo...</a>",1342948632

Telephones do PCM encoding (meaning it has data representing the graph of the sound wave) at 8 kh/z. Following the nyquist sampling theorem (cut your rate by 2), this can allow frequencies up to 4 kh/z (as you said). It's not a hard cutoff though, you can still get most of the sounds above that pitch, they'll just sound pretty weird (as if you were talking on the telephone!)",1342948479

Everything we build on and upon is no longer unique: it's all inspired, and improved.<p>Jim Jarmusch said this once:<p>>Nothing is original.

Great! You owe us 500 million dollars, get to work.<p>I think estate taxes are defensible, but the way this particular estate was handled doesn't seem defensible. Out of all the things someone could do with their vast fortunes, buying art and then loaning it out to museums and collections doesn't seem like the worst thing in the world.<p>In particular, the article points out that black market valuations may have even been considered when valuing the art in the estate: That means the government is basically encouraging these works of art to be sold on the black market (likely to private collectors who will keep them in private), where if they were at least sold on the open market - or in this case, held by the original owners - they would be more likely to be put on loan to museums so the public could benefit from them.<p>Alternately, in a case like this where it's illegal to sell the item being taxed, the government should offer the option of simply handing it over to them in order to erase the tax liability, or giving it to a charity, in order to conclusively demonstrate that no profit is being made from the work of art (black market or otherwise).",1342948346

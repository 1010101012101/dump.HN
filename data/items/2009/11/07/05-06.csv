927567,comment,927416,927468,0,0,vanekl,,,"One, the US is in the midst of a major restructuring of the economy. It's going to take time. A lot of us are going to be playing musical chairs until a more efficient allocation of our labors occurs. It's as much about /how/ our talents should be allocated in this new economy as opposed to our talents. That's a subtle difference, but an important distinction.<p>Two, Americans don't move around as much as they used to. We used to move about once every 5 years. Now, when a recession hits, we don't move to where the jobs are as much. That slows the recovery down.<p>Three, there are major pieces of legislation that have not been resolved. That does not help the business community decide whether it's OK to hire. The quicker the legislation is handled (one way or another), the faster the restructuring of the economy and the faster people will be put back to work.<p>Four, ""productivity"" in the midst of a recession is just a fancy name for fewer workers doing more work because their co-workers were let go. This new-found ""productivity"" wont last long, and will go back to the mean as soon as rehiring starts.<p>Five, there will /always/ be a demand for people to fix other people's screw-ups (if you're in the IT industry). The last two jobs I was on they were looking for somebody who can migrate their ancient systems to something more modern. People are figuring out that's it's really easy to build things, but quite a different matter when it comes time to migrate.<p>Six, we are working our way through a large bubble. This recession says more about the bubble than the skills of the labor force. But, yes, major labor adjustments will be made.<p>Seven, businesses are scared and banks wont lend to small business. It's not that labor is unnecessary, but that next to nobody wants to take the risk in a down economy, or those who do can't get the capital. Some well-managed companies haven't laid off anybody and are thriving (e.g. Apple). Google has started re-staffing, so they see things picking up. It will take time, but it's getting better. The well-managed companies see the shift and are first movers.<p>Eight, this economic restructuring is normal. It's scary if you've never lived through one before, but it's by no means unique. It's actually more than normal, it's occasionally necessary to force a restructuring and wring out the excesses.<p>Nine, things are better than they appear on the surface. We have started the recovery but it's hard to tell because the lagging indicators are still down. Just because pessimism is in vogue doesn't mean things are getting worse.<p>Lastly, we have finally slipped our shackles. No more WinTel. Instead, we get to figure out the best way to handle multi-core. RDBMs are no longer de rigueur; we get to apply NoSQL where it makes sense. Hardware is so cheap that instead of doing backups we just use clustering or multiple-allocation. RAM is so cheap that we can put the whole internet in it. Disk is morphing to solid-state right before our eyes. The opportunities are far greater than they have ever been. And those of us who have been keeping up will lead the way.",1257573272

927540,comment,927478,927478,0,0,patio11,,,"My one piece of advice, and this is not confined to YC interviews but goes for any time you are selling (and make no mistake, you are selling), is to talk up the problem a little bit before you lead into your solution.<p>I expect PG and company are experts with regards to the needs of web startups and inexpert with regards to many fields of human endeavor.  If you're going to be targeting one of those fields, mention the importance in ways which are easy for non-experts to understand.  Our field is important: it employs X million, supports N companies on the Fortune 500, and did $ZZ billion in sales last year.  Our problem keeps these people up at night -- they write journal articles about it, they spend hundreds of millions addressing it, it might even have killed a few thousand people they care about last year.<p>After you do that, people will be more inclined to view your solution in a positive light.

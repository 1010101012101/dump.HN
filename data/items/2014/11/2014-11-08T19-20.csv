I think that other languages, for instance &quot;Rust&quot;, will eventually fix everything that C++ is forced to do wrong (due to its legacy), and these new languages will become more and more attractive to use as a development language.<p>Some things I personally hope will be added to C++ and/or Rust:<p>- coroutines<p>- lightweight threads<p>- garbage collection (for high-level stuff)<p>- a natural form of metaprogramming (not the convoluted approach taken by the boost libraries), i.e., active libraries that generate code based on given parameters<p>- pure, lazy functional programming (language subset), e.g. for concurrent stuff<p>- pattern matching",1415476730

Whereas Apple&#x27;s business model is based upon making user friendly software and devices in a closed ecosystem, Indie wants to do the same by doing this in a open ecosystem, using open tools and basically operating completely in the open, to the point that everything which is going to be produced will be free (as in free speech) from day one.<p>Another goal of Indie is to break the hegemony of Google and Facebook (and the startups that (want to) follow in their footsteps). The reasoning behind is is that these companies operate in a way that seriously undermine, dare I say destroy, human rights and democracy. Whilst Indie is aware that these problems cannot be tackled with technology alone, there&#x27;s room for some fresh thinking and alternatives. That there&#x27;s room for technology which respects the user, not only from a user experience perspective, but also from a human rights perspective. The first of these alternatives, Heartbeat - which is aiming to become a free (as in speech) and open, well designed, fully distributed social network is to be launched next year.<p>I hope this gives a better idea about what Indie is trying to accomplish. For some more background information see Aral&#x27;s talk &quot;I, Simulation&quot; <a href=""http://vimeo.com/106681730"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/106681730</a> and/or the transcripts and videos from the first get together: <a href=""https://ind.ie/about/summit/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ind.ie/about/summit/</a><p>Or just ask away here, I&#x27;ll try to answer them while Aral is out in the UK celebrating his birthday :)<p>(A small note beforehand: feel free to write any reasoned criticism about Indie or its ideas if you would like to do so. However, due to the rather &quot;radical&quot; rationale behind Indie recently some not-to-be named people thought it was best to let their criticism known by verbally assaulting members of the Indie team via email and/or other forms of communication, even going as far as doing some nasty tactics popular with the 4chan crowd (if you get my drift). I&#x27;m open to having (serious) discussion about (the rationale behind) Indie, but if we head into that area it&#x27;s pretty safe to say discussion will be over.)",1415476518

  2) Controlling for ability* erases almost all the disparity 
  3) White and black infants have same distribution of ability  
  4) Large disparity in ability develops between white and blacks by age 18
</code></pre>
Disparities between whites and blacks seem to be more a product of poverty rather than bigoted employers. There is obviously more to racism than employment and wages, but this is a significant. To be clear, this is not to hand wave away a serious social problem, but rather to focus attention on the actual causes of it. If it were simply racism, there are easier solutions. Just appeal to the greed of rapacious capitalists: perfectly qualified workers from visible minorities would be underpriced wrt the majority. If instead differences in wages instead reflect differences in skills (from crappy schools, dysfunctional family environments, etc), then the problem is a little more insoluble.<p>[1] <a href=""https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jpolec/v104y1996i5p869-95.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jpolec/v104y1996i5p869-95.html</a><p>More recent summary from Roland Fryer (abstract alone is good):

Resumes currently have terrible formatting and can&#x27;t be parsed very accurately.<p>Most people don&#x27;t know this but recruiters in large corps rarily read through any of the resumes that comes in. Almost all applications are first parsed by one of the four major resume extraction vendors (sovren, resume mirror, burning glass, daxtra) then dumped into an applicant tracking system. Usually a resume is looked at only when someone does a keyword search on their database. While the process does extract majority of the content it still garbles up a lot of sections that people have spent hours painstakingly editing.<p>The industry seems to be stuck in a crazy process where it takes structured data turn it into a generally unstructured format (pdf, docx) and use another set of service to try to parse it back again.<p>We have a unique opportunity to actually work with one of the major resume extraction vendors and start to embed hrXML meta data into a pdf resume so that it can perfectly extracted.

8577918,comment,8571837,8577336,0,0,raiph,,,"Gotchya.<p>Just to be clear for any others reading along:<p>* One can run (a subset of) Perl 5 code directly on any of the Rakudo backends (thus even on the JVM) by using v5, a Perl 5 compiler written in Perl 6.[1] I think it will be many years, if ever, before v5 parses all of Perl 5 and becomes a good choice for running arbitrary legacy Perl 5 code without tweaks, but it&#x27;s probably going to be a key piece of technology bridging to Perl 5 in 2015. In particular, there&#x27;s been talk recently of combining it with Inline::Perl5, discussed next, to provide improved sugar for P5 <-> P6 combinations.[2]<p>* Any host that can run arbitrary C code can run just about any Perl 5 code (including modules that use XS) via libperl, an embedded version of the stock Perl 5 interpreter. Inline::Perl5 uses this approach to allow the Rakudo Perl 6 compiler to run P5 code under P6 control without significant limitations. Inline::Perl5 allows one to pass P5 objects to P6 code that can then alter said objects and pass them back. And vice-versa, with P6 objects passed to P5 for manipulation back in P5 land. One can also create P6 sub-classes of P5 classes, thus using P6 code to tweak or extend P5 code. This already works out-of-the-box for Rakudo Star with the MoarVM backend; it&#x27;s just a SMOP to make it work likewise for other backends.<p>(There are other nice pieces related to having P5 and P6 work together, but this is already a long comment.)<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/rakudo-p5/v5"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rakudo-p5/v5</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2014-10-12#i_9494778"" rel=""nofollow"">http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2014-10-12#i_9494778</a>",1415475345

While Turing may have been a victim of the Cold War, von Neumann was its champion, influencing the policy of Mutually Assured Destruction from his commanding positions at Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study and the Atomic Energy Commission. Born to a wealthy family in Hungary in 1903, he experienced at first hand the Communist government that briefly came to power after the First World War, and became an ardent foe of Communism. He acknowledged that atomic weaponry was a “monster” but perceived it as the lesser of two evils, advocating a pre-emptive nuclear strike against the USSR. Hoping to create a hydrogen bomb, he needed a stored-program electronic computer, and in 1945 began to construct one at the Institute.<p>[1] I highly recommend the reviewed book, Turing&#x27;s Cathedral.

They call it the resilience of the duped. It’s with intense regret that you watch them go down the tubes.”<p>It&#x27;s nice to see that Randi is still able to see these people as human beings, rather than charlatans to be disproved. I was a big fan of his back when I was reading a lot of Ayn Rand and preaching Reason as the only god, and I took a sort of smug pleasure in watching him debunk psychics and mystics. But I realize now that that was just another form of dehumanization.<p>On an unrelated note, I recall an interview where Randi said he never took drugs because he sought to experience &quot;the realest reality.&quot; That strikes me as very odd. Surely hallucinations are a part of reality, albeit a highly subjective part. I&#x27;m surprised that someone so involved with the paranormal would have no interest in studying the psychedelic experience.",1415473362

In Japan, gap doesn&#x27;t exist as much between occupations as in US, but between employment status; whether if you&#x27;re a &quot;proper&quot; member of the company (正社員), usually hired right out of school and expected to spend your entire career there, or not.  Even if one do the same amount of work, a proper member generally gets much higher pay, enjoys various benefits, and is protected well from layoffs.  It&#x27;s ironic that you brought up nobleness---in a sense, the proper member is regarded more noble, because they swear allegiance to the company, thus payed higher, regardless of what they actually do.",1415473331

If Apple wanted to offer both dual and quad-core chips in the Mac mini, they&#x27;d need to design and ship two different boards.<p>It might have been more costly to do so, but I think that Apple&#x27;s doing their customers a great disservice by not offering something between a dual-core i5 with soldered RAM and the $3K Mac Pro.",1415473330

Due to personal circumstances, I have been looking for a new job in the last month. I got two phone interview with Google and Snapchat thanks to internal referrals, and my conclusion was simply that I can&#x27;t think for my life during the phone interview -- I don&#x27;t know if I will do better with on site interview.<p>The excuses (reasons) can be numerous: living in REPL and Emacs make me looks like an idiot on normal text editor, personal issue is causing my confidence to be all-time-low right now. Anyway, assuming that I&#x27;m half competent, I&#x27;d like to preserve my sanity and do away with the (technical) interview altogether.<p>I&#x27;m not at the point where I can just be hired based on credentials/past work yet. Likewise, my network is no where near enough to make a hire recommendation that can just skip interview -- I hope that it will be the case a few years from now, but not right now. That said, is it realistic, and how can I find a job without technical interview (ie whiteboard/ google Docs coding)?<p>My current job title is &quot;Lead Software Engineer&quot; (I was first engineering hire), although I don&#x27;t manage anyone directly and is still individual contributor. I&#x27;m just looking for another SE job, obviously. Probably not junior level, but I don&#x27;t really know how &quot;senior&quot; normal senior job is.",1432166345

Why is it that the poorest neighborhoods have the poorest schools?  If you want income inequality you have to flip that upside down and start teaching students what they need to know to have better income.  Things like basic finance, how to negotiate, the realities of what jobs pay etc.  They should know about student loans, scholarships, government programs, and how to pick a college that will actually pay off as an investment.<p>Also kids in desolated neighborhoods need to be counseled.  They need to learn how to take care of themselves and how to avoid eating nothing but sugar with no fiber since their parent(s) are too exhausted or beaten down or addicted to make a meal that isn&#x27;t mac and cheese and sprite.<p>The drug war is part of that. How can kids learn and grow up properly when their families are being put in jail and they are left with no one to provide for them or take care of them while it costs huge amounts of money from the government to imprison them?

It&#x27;s like the difference between making something out of Lego as opposed to clay. I&#x27;m still making castles in the clouds, but they really exist in a surprisingly concrete way because they&#x27;re made up of concrete parts. I can feed them into a compiler and execute them or run them through static analysis and answer questions about them… (As an aside, I find the same value in music theory: it provides components needed to turn arbitrary sounds into music without being overwhelmed.)<p>As a bonus, programs end up inherently well-founded and checked for correctness, potentially to an extent unrivaled by even the most rigorous natural language arguments. But that&#x27;s just that: a bonus. The real value of a proof assistant is for <i>assistance</i>, not proof. (Which, I should add, is radically different from automatic theorem provers, which are far more relevant for CS than math.)<p>The lock-in comment at the end is interesting, but not limited to <i>technical</i> lock-in. Mathematics, as a community, already has quite extensive <i>social</i> lock-in—in large part simply because it <i>is</i> a community. And what happens to people whose ideas cannot be expressed in light of this social lock-in (but may, in fact, be entirely consistent)? They are indeed &quot;forced to resort to <i>samizdat</i>, or even blogs, to get their work published&quot;. I suppose in a world with finite resources and attention this is inevitable, but I don&#x27;t think the technical factor changes anything meaningfully. If anything, it&#x27;s a better sort of lock-in because it would have a technical component independent of social issues, personalities and fashion.",1432166165

Send an amount of bitcoins to each address.<p>3. If in the future legitimate domain owners create legit certs, the attacker could present his own malicious cert and victims could potentially accept the malicious one as legit even when they are aware of the more recent legit cert, because the malicious one is older.<p>Pros and cons of the attack:<p>- Pro: There are no permanent costs to this attack, only temporary ones. Bitcoins have to remain in these addresses for the duration of the attack(s), but the attacker can get his coins back afterward.<p>- Con: The attacker can attack only a limited number of domains, as more and more coins become needed.<p>- Con: Malicious certs must be created earlier than the legit certs<p>So perhaps users should not trust certs that have been created earlier, but those that have the most coins locked in. But then nothing prevents an attacker from creating a cert with many coins (more than what the legit owner spent) to perform an attack for a few days, then later get his coins back when he doesn&#x27;t need the cert any more.<p>So really there should be a fine balance when evaluating these 2 properties: trust old certs that have many coins locked in. But sometimes trust newer certs if they have more coins locked in. But not too new or else it might just be a sign of an attack. This fuzzy logic would probably cause many false negatives or false positives that ultimately could make end-users not trust the system.",1432165213

I am an advocate for privacy, and I think it&#x27;s crazy that businesses need to ask people for photo ID to make fairly simple purchases.<p>I sell digital goods for online games.  This means I do not have shipping receipts that will make me eligible for seller protection.  The reality is that more and more businesses are providing services and products which are intangible.  I&#x27;d imagine more than 50% of PayPal transactions these days do not involve shipping labels, yet their entire claim system revolves around them.<p>What I&#x27;ve noticed in the past 5-8 years is that Paypal has really cut down on real fraud.  When I started doing business in 2007, there were kids who couldn&#x27;t have been older than 15 years old buying stolen PayPal accounts on sketchy forums, and using them to buy digital products like MMO currency.  We&#x27;d get hit quite regularly with real fraud.<p>Today, it seems that there are much less of these stolen accounts in circulation.  Paypal has clearly cleaned up their act and put a bunch of security measures in place to prevent unauthorized access to people&#x27;s funds.  Nonetheless, unauthorized claims and chargebacks still happen.  These days it&#x27;s just people who spend a bunch of money, and decide later to try and get it all back, everyone else be damned.<p>There&#x27;s not much you can do to screen for them placing those disputes.  All we can do is collect as much information as possible, from all our buyers, to make sure that no real fraud gets through our systems.  I do feel that if we did not have security measures in place, the stolen Paypal accounts might show up again.<p>But yes, long story short, I really wish there was a better way than collecting people&#x27;s ID&#x27;s.

As much as people like to gloss over them and brush them off as rubber stamps, if you actually read the released FISC opinions you&#x27;d see there was a good deal of pushback (see [1] as an example of the NSA overstepping their bounds and being forced to stop by the court).  Likewise, you can look at the in-fighting between Sen Feinsein and former Sen Rogers on one side with Sen Wyden and former Sen Udall on the other.  Right now we also have a major disagreement between the Judges on the FISC and the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals on the legality of the phone records program, which likely won&#x27;t be resolved unless the law is renewed and it&#x27;s appealed to the Supreme Court.<p>There is oversight.  Yes, it is done in secret for the sake of protect intelligence sources, but it does in fact exist.  And, frankly, I think the Snowden disclosures themselves show that they largely work.  Before the Church/Pike reforms back in the 70s, the NSA was specifically targeting anti-war protesters, civil rights activists and even congressmen[2].  Now, despite his best efforts, Greenwald has yet to show evidence of a single American that was targeted by the NSA.<p>> Do you think cracking Google networks and the likes were &quot;legitimate actions&quot;?<p>I would probably be really pissed off if that&#x27;s actually what they did.  I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re referring to this[3], in which the authors start off trying to suggest that the NSA is breaking into Google and Yahoo data centers, but when you read further and look at the source documents it becomes apparent that what was actually happening was that Google and Yahoo were sending their international data-center traffic across the globe unencrypted, and GCHQ was picking it up on one of their fiber taps.  Now stop and consider that every other country that those leased fiber lines passed through was probably doing the exact same thing.  I don&#x27;t see this as NSA abuse, I see this as Google getting caught not protecting its customers&#x27; information.<p>And in line with my complaint in my above comment, the article finishes with &quot;It is not clear how much data from Americans is collected and how much of that is retained.&quot;  So what kind of data is collected?  Who is being targeted?  Why are they being targeted?  What is the data being used for?  Am I being targeted?  Are other Americans being targeted?  The article doesn&#x27;t answer any of these questions, nor does it give me any indication as to who else might be listening in and what data they&#x27;re collecting.<p>If the NSA is using that access to gather information on, say, Russian targets, I don&#x27;t care - good for them.  If the NSA was using that access to collect data on the Russian government, and now that intelligence source has dried up,  then the Washington Post has just done disservice to the American people.

It&#x27;s a practical question about which mode gets auto-indentation right <i>right now</i>.<p>edit: I don&#x27;t know the answer to your question. What I do know is that it&#x27;s really hard to get indentation right in Emacs for languages with significant whitespace where new lines are the only marker, and I assume the same is true for TextMate (which Atom piggybacks on for indentation). I&#x27;m not an expert on emacs, emacs lisp or creating language modes for emacs, but I do have a decent amount of experience[1]. So when I say I&#x27;m sympathetic I mean it down in my bones.<p>But still, if an editor can&#x27;t get auto-indentation right, it&#x27;s a deal-breaker.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/elixir-lang/emacs-elixir/blob/master/elixir-smie.el"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/elixir-lang/emacs-elixir/blob/master/elix...</a>",1432163062

I have had my fair share of troubles over the years, but none worse than the time I got paid for doing some freelance work into my Paypal account, I ended up with a balance of around $8k and it took me 3 months to get it released. I went through their ID process, sent them stuff and would wait a week only to be told to send it again.<p>The problem with Paypal is they are too big to care. They&#x27;ve essentially become a bank, nobody knows what is going on, you get passed on from department to department when you need answers and they are always quick to freeze your Paypal balance when they want you to do something or want to insinuate you have done something wrong.<p>I would have slapped them with a $100m penalty, $25m is just too little to make any kind of impact or different to Paypal.",1432162958

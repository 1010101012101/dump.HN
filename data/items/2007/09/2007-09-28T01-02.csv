And any competition at all will quickly drive the price to the market price, free.<p>Still might make a good excuse to try Auctomatic.",1190944748

Even if we stopped it today, we'd already have a half dozen logos better than the current one to choose from...still got 9 days to go.  I'm thinking we'll be doing more of these for future design tasks.",1190941950

No one is watching the feeds.<p>A trained professional watching a single video feed will miss 90% of important activity after 20 minutes. There are 3 million CCTV cameras in the UK.<p>Like I said, no one is watching.<p>But automated surveillance is getting very good. A single server can currently run around 5 video streams. At least that was what Intellivid could do last I spoke with them. They do retail loss prevention. They're based in Cambridge and look like a good company for any hackers.
www.intellivid.com<p>Very, very soon, all of these CCTVs are going to be ""turned on"". Computers will find anomalous behavior, identify people from their gait (how they walk -- surprisingly more reliable than face recognition), track them across multiple cameras even with large gaps in footage, etc.. Gunshot detection and localization is pretty easy, but goes beyond the camera systems.<p>There is a book everyone interested in the topic needs to read on the subject: The Transparent Society

The systems are here.<p>The solution is openness. Almost all government CCTV feeds should be open to public view, for example.",1190941744

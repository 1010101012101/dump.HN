It was probably due to the fact that their contributions didn&#x27;t hold the same value anymore.<p>The linked NYT article in the posted article says that the two that quit were two of the &quot;most valued employees&quot;, which to me seems like people who were early hires or responsible for some/most the revenue (through tech/sales/whatever). If that&#x27;s the case, they took the small/early business risks and when a pay off came, they got passed over. I would absolutely consider other opportunities if that happened to me and I was in a key position because it&#x27;s likely I was under market value to begin with.<p>If you want to do this kind of thing, all of your early hires have to be on board with the eventual change or you just need to hire everyone at $70k minimum from the ground up. If not, it&#x27;s reasonable to expect high performers to leave. Mr. Price either didn&#x27;t know how those two felt or didn&#x27;t care.<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/business/a-company-copes-with-backlash-against-the-raise-that-roared.html?_r=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/business/a-company-copes-w...</a>",1452441438

Reread that part of the text from a neutral place.<p>&quot;Next, it’s time to understand the legal difference between what Uber is doing and what taxi companies are doing. The taxi industry is highly regulated and each cab must have a medallion, which is basically a licence to operate a car as a taxi. With prices over $300,000, these medallions can be valued as highly as a home. Since Uber has shown up, those prices have plummeted.<p>Why go through the hassle of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to become a taxi driver when you can just download an app and become an Uber driver for free? Taxi companies, which are regulated by the government, cannot compete.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s stating that the playing field is unfair and that becoming a taxi driver isn&#x27;t a career path anymore.<p>>Apparently we are at whim of a &quot;single private company&quot; controlling our transportation, but somehow being at the whim of state governments is not an issue at all.<p>This article focuses around Uber&#x27;s role in our lives, not the government.

(Of course this applies to the company with the $70K minimum wage as well: that company could have used the money it cost to implement this policy to instead hire more people.) There are counter-arguments along the lines of the demand for labor being inelastic and other such, but it&#x27;s kinda off to not present a sensible argument against a minimum wage while presenting a crazy strawman argument against it, the latter implying with a high likelihood that the author supports a high minimum wage.",1452439674

Arch packaging barely needs a tutorial at all. The best part about it is how all the packaging tools are shipped with the package manager. pacman can install remote packages as well as tarballs, and &quot;makepkg&quot; ships with pacman.<p>Scratch that actually - the best part about it is how development libraries ship alongside the packages. I <i>really</i> don&#x27;t miss having to install -dev packages <i>all the time</i>, especially having hundreds of them polluting all my queries.<p>When I tried creating packages for debian (this was quite a way back and it seems like things have improved, but not that much), I spent ages getting all the packages I needed in the first place and I had to keep track of far too many commands, had to constantly re-open the tutorials every time I wanted to create a new one. The PPA system is also far too cumbersome for one-off packages you want to distribute, compared to distributing just a PKGBUILD / source package (especially since arch has the AUR).<p>I feel the debian world could really stand to take some lessons from Arch in that aspect.",1452438625

I don&#x27;t like that Skimlinks changes urls on click, but the basic idea of automating an affiliate network is solid. The biggest problem with the web is how to properly pay people who actually creat value, and this moves in that direction.<p>I like your suggestion that Pinterest develop a direct businesses relationship with affiliate linkers, but I think it should be broader. If you force people to pay for the right to post affiliate links, volune will be low. It would be much better to simply add a money layer on top of the existing inspiration network.<p>Here&#x27;s the idea: <i>Every heavy Pinterest user is an affiliate partner</i><p>User joins the site, uses it normally. Pinterest skimlinks all their posts, creating revenue when the ser posts something high quality yhat drives purchase behavior.  When the user hit a certain level of posts / views, they are invited to opt-in to a revenue sharing deal. The user gets 50% of the skinlink revenue. This incentives more sharing and creates a path for fir-profit pintresting.<p>The biggest challenge here is brand accounts. Brands who don&#x27;t develop a direct relationship with Pinterest are skimlinked like everyone else, and basically wind up paying Pinterest for revenue-creating links to their own sites.<p>This would probably drive straight affiliate linking clickbaiters off the site, because they can&#x27;t make as much as they would with a direct affiliate relationship with the target site. I think you&#x27;d makr up for the lost posts in higher posting rates by newly incentived power users though.

The thesis goes as follows:\nJust as natural, i.e. non-intentional phenomena are &#x27;governed&#x27; by natural laws, i.e. principles which tell us either what will invariably or in statistical average be the case under in principle recurrent and repeatable circumstances, in an analogous manner intentional phenomena are &#x27;governed&#x27; by normative rules which tell us what people under given circumstances are (or were) expected or allowed or practically necessitated to do. I am, in other words, pleading for what might be called a &#x27;methodological parallelism&#x27; between natural laws on the one hand and laws and other societal rules on the other hand. I am inviting you to see the difference between the humanities and the natural sciences in the light of the difference between the factual and the normative, between rules which state how things in fact go and rules which ordain how they should go according to the conceptions of those who instituted the rules.</blockquote><p>Make of that what you will :)",1452438323

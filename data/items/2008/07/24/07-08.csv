They want to make an online encyclopedia.<p>I hope it succeeds, wikipedia is so full of wrong, but verifiable, information that it's hard to use it. (ColdFusion, UFO's, and the Singularity, are wonderful examples of wrong, but verifiable.)",1216886144

255167,comment,254958,254958,0,0,kellan,,,"Great feedback.  You absolutely need both RESTful APIs, and these XMPP data services we talked about.  We definitely aren't suggesting getting rid of all your current APIs and moving everything to XMPP, e.g. we talked about reusing your URI described resources as your XMPP pubsub node descriptors so you can build hybrid apps.",1216885701

Then there is the no background-applications limitation because it might ""hurt"" the iPhone's image if they sucked some battery.<p>Now this. It seems Apple is a <i>tad</i> over-protective about their supposedly great platform. I'm suspicious of anything in need of this much protection.",1216884241

255155,comment,254958,254958,0,0,Tichy,,,"I still wonder if we don't need both options, subscriptions and polling. Because otherwise, it would also be very cheap to subscribe to LOTS of things without really being interested (like those people on Twitter who follow 10000 users), which would also result in pushing unnecessary data around. Not sure if this would be handled by ""presence"", but even so - I want my client to receive all updates, even if it is down sometimes (no messages should be missed).",1216883270

It&#x27;s not like they came out with 3 updates to the game without modernising their webpages.<p>My list of negative things about the article:<p><pre><code>  1. There is no author named
  2. Picture of Bill Gates is irrelevant
  3. Title is misleading
  4. Second paragraph is too open to interpretation
       - Should be &quot;1 of 9^9^9 pages on microsoft.com remain untouched&quot;
  5. Third paragraph uses &quot;such as&quot; to imply there are more titles
  6. Calling the hn thread fiery and inaccessible, what exactly is inaccessible about a thread on hn?
  7. Second to last paragraph only tried to poke fun at microsoft. Essentially like complaining that a tesla car only runs on electricity.

Governments for thousands of years have been wishing for such a thing, and now our generation finally has it, because we live in the future... and you&#x27;re going out of your way to give it up.</i><p>I&#x27;m keen on getting a system that makes that promise as well; but HOW can I get that today for my email?  That is the practical problem I&#x27;m addressing.<p>Your other comments about blind faith, etc. are somewhat out of context.  There is a secret key, and it needs to be kept safe or your stored email can be compromised.  Whether the private key is on your laptop or on your server, you <i>cannot guarantee</i> it is perfectly safe; if either computer is airgapped it&#x27;s pretty useless for reading your email.<p>Certainly, you don&#x27;t trust to blind faith that your server is secure; but you don&#x27;t trust to blind faith that your laptop is, either.<p>If you set up a private Lavabit, in your favor, you have a private key that&#x27;s encrypted with a key that&#x27;s not stored on your server, so someone who gains read access to your server still cannot actually compromise you, and someone will full access still cannot compromise you until you sign in again.  Also in your favor, nowadays it&#x27;s fairly well-known how to lock down/harden a single-purpose server so that it would be very difficult to compromise; you&#x27;d basically need only 3 ports open, ever, you can disable root SSH and enable private key auth only, etc..  It&#x27;s simpler than securing a laptop that you use for a billion different purposes.<p>Against you are the facts that you don&#x27;t keep the server with you (probably -- unless it lives at your house), and it&#x27;s a more visible target -- it must be findable because that&#x27;s where your emails are delivered.<p>Your same arguments about your expertise in securing your server also apply to securing your own laptop.  Using your own arguments, if you read email on a laptop that you also use for web browsing, you&#x27;re &quot;opening doors for the adversary&quot;, aren&#x27;t you?<p>> * In this case I don&#x27;t know what the better solution is, because it hasn&#x27;t been invented yet.*<p>This is the real problem.  I&#x27;m no Edward Snowden; I&#x27;m not an NSA target and don&#x27;t expect to be.  I want to secure my email because I think everyone should.  Are you saying I should wait another X years before using email?<p>A private Lavabit is the best solution I see right now -- I totally agree that anyone should deploy <i>any</i> solution with their eyes open (even if you keep the private key locally only, that does not guarantee security either...).  But that said, I can imagine a server image and simple set of instructions that would enable someone to set up a private Lavabit that would be a better solution than anything I am able to set up myself, certainly better than the original Lavabit, and far better than what most people use to store email.",1383734651

First here is the base line (using my own transaction.list file):<p><pre><code>  $ time awk &#x27;{ SUM+=$5 } END {printf &quot;%d\n&quot;, SUM}&#x27; transaction.list 
  7725580800
  
  real	0m1.419s
  user	0m1.391s
  sys	0m0.027s

  $ time perl -e &#x27;my $sum = 0; while (<>) { my @F=split; $sum+=$F[4]} printf&quot;%d\n&quot;, $sum&#x27; transaction.list
  7725580800

  real	0m3.453s
  user	0m3.428s
  sys	0m0.024s
</code></pre>
So this can be improved upon by removing need to create that temporary @F array in each loop...<p><pre><code>  $ time perl -ne &#x27;$sum += (split)[4]; END {printf &quot;%d\n&quot;, $sum}&#x27; transaction.list 
  7725580800
  
  real	0m2.727s
  user	0m2.700s
  sys	0m0.026s
</code></pre>
Better but has mentioned by <i>dtamhk</i> elsewhere here, <i>split</i> can be speeded up if you are able to give it a limit:<p><pre><code>  $ time perl -ne &#x27;$sum += (split /\s+/, $_, 5)[4]; END {printf &quot;%d\n&quot;, $sum}&#x27; transaction.list  
  7725580800

  real	0m1.657s
  user	0m1.632s
  sys	0m0.023s
</code></pre>
So now pretty much identical to awk speed.  And if you&#x27;re able to use <i>substr</i> instead of <i>split</i> then you can make it significantly faster than awk:<p><pre><code>  $ time perl -ne &#x27;$sum += substr($_, 30, 12); END {printf &quot;%d\n&quot;, $sum}&#x27; transaction.list 
  7725580800

I&#x27;m not sure if there are too many fantasy sports fans here but I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try. From a technical standpoint, I developed the site on Google App Engine in Java and a fair bit of JS on the front end.<p>The site itself is different from most weekly fantasy formats in that users can keep players on their roster for as long as they want. In most weekly formats, players are drafted prior to each contest. Because players can be maintained indefinitely, the best players in the league cost money (up to $10). For example, you can buy Peyton Manning for $10 and after doing so, you can use him as much as you want - even into next season.
We&#x27;re not funded, if that matters, and I am the only dev on the team so far. I am also an iOS dev and if this site gets any traction, an iOS app will be soon to follow. Let me know what you think and if you have any questions, technical or otherwise. Thanks!<p>PS - the site is NOT mobile optimized so please look at it on your desktop/laptop.

I was one of those for whom the term &quot;hacker&quot; had a negative connotation.<p>I&#x27;m a designer and I didn&#x27;t understand 90% of the topics discussed here. But the reason why I stuck around and why HN eventually became my most visited site, is the community&#x27;s quality. Comment threads usually spawn multi-leveled discussions with various but not radical opinions about a topic. The top comment can slightly favor point A while its top answer moderates the tone with or without contradicting it. The result is a a discussion with various shades while most comment threads on other websites are generally black or white and favor one-liner jokes to in-depth opinions.<p>I believe Digg was still around in 2009 but was mostly focused on offbeat news. Slashdot never appealed to me. And even though reddit covers a lot of topics, the community isn&#x27;t really open to discussion and/or criticism.<p>Although HN is mostly a tech news site, it oddly taught me more about arts, politics, business and lifestyle than any other website. I guess quality can&#x27;t restrict itself to one single topic.",1383733103

With segmented stacks, when you hit the end of a stack, you must (1) allocate a new segment to extend the stack and (2) copy the current function frame to the new segment and  resume execution. Then, when the function returns, you have to (3) deallocate the new segment and shrink the stack, and (4) resume execution of the last function frame on the previous stack segment.<p>Now, steps (1) and (3) are optional, but steps (2) and (4) are not, and incur a significant overhead (compared with non-segmented, contiguous stack, e.g. C stack).",1383733062

Carbs are not bad per se. Sure, big amounts of sugar are and a diet mainly consisting of carbs is probably as well. Italy is a nice example of a country where olive oil is abundant in their diet as well. What I think is the #1 advantage of Keto etc. is that you have no choice but to have a better look at what you eat (same with Paleo) as all the unhealthy, heavily processed stuff is simply not allowed anymore.<p>I actually started with Keto because I thought it was a cool diet hack that tricked you into not eating the stuff everyone with knowledge of diets was already telling you not to eat (the whole &quot;fat is bad&quot; for you has already been on a decline for some time now).<p>But Keto is not telling you bread is bad. It&#x27;s telling you for the purpose of this diet it&#x27;s bad. And the purpose is calorie intake reduction by eating bigger than normal amounts of fat which are supposedly more filling. And at least for me I can second that. I counted calories a bit before starting Keto and a week while doing Keto. My intake was severly reduced while eating as much as I wanted.",1383732137

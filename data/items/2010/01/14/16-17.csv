In the places I have lived (a fairly affluent suburb of Chiacago, and a college town in the middle of nowhere), the hysterical response is very common, probably because there is no practical side to it -- people who want in will break in anyway and mostly everyone else keeps out.  Sure there is the occasional drunk college kid who is somehow lost and crashes on the wrong couch, but they are mostly harmless, and very appreciative when you don't call the cops.",1263486549

However, there are many, many factors that can hamper operations (e.g. port congestion, vessel being behind schedule, lack of trucks for empty repositioning, etc), which don't always let you use your space to 100% capacity.<p>A single operational problem can cause hundreds of containers to be stranded on the wrong side of the trade and sit unused for months. It's incredibly difficult to catch up and recover when you're at a space premium.<p>There's also the issue of inland transport.

Rails is of the opinion that the database should have a certain sort of schema, and be abstracted away by ORM. If you like SQL, don't use Rails.

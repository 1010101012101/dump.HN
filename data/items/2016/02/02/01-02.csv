I can&#x27;t edit the original anymore, so here&#x27;s my update:<p>I guess the harsh reaction came from the fact that I didn&#x27;t define the scope very well: My question wasn&#x27;t in reference to M-R specifically, just in general. I understand that in this case it makes sense to look at likelier causes (see Sharlin&#x27;s response).<p>My point was that it&#x27;s interesting to look at what happens (or what our reaction is) when very very very improbable events do happen. It seems weird to go with the assumption that because something is extremely unlikely that it won&#x27;t happen.<p>When I roll a dice 20 times, I get a particular arrangement of numbers. Given the total number of arrangements possible, that particular arrangement is extremely unlikely, yet I just got it.<p>A guy got struck by lightning 7 times (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Sullivan"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Sullivan</a>). The odds of any person getting struck by lightning is 1 in 10000. Seven times in a row is 1 in 2^93. But then when you start drilling down, you see that he&#x27;s a park ranger, and that he&#x27;s out while lightning happens, which makes the probability that he&#x27;ll get struck much higher.<p>If I had phrased the question to you asking what the likelihood of <i>any given person</i> in the world being struck seven times was, you could have calculated the former and said 2^-93 is such a small probability that it&#x27;s not worth thinking about - and yet here is Roy Sullivan, so there&#x27;s some sort of conflict in my logic. What&#x27;s wrong with the former calculation?<p>Why is it that for any given person the probability is 2^-93 but for Roy it&#x27;s somehow different, even though he is a &quot;given person&quot;? Is it that the 1 in 10000 number was wrong? But then if we look at all the people who never once got struck, it seems about right. If we inflate that number to 1 in 100 to make Roy likelier to get 7 in a row, then it seems everyone also should be getting shocked more often at least once or twice.<p>Or maybe it&#x27;s that somehow the probability changes when we have more information and those two numbers and situations are not comparable on an absolute scale. Maybe if you get hit twice then you&#x27;re much likelier to get hit again because you&#x27;re probably in some dangerous location - but how was I to know to factor this in? It seems that it&#x27;s very much about how you calculate the probability. Who knows what other hidden factors could be wildly affecting the true value of the probability?<p>That also makes me think - is there even such a thing as the &quot;true&quot; or inherent probability of an event happening?<p>edit: Or maybe it&#x27;s the law of large numbers - given enough &quot;trials&quot; or in this case lightning events with people around, even something with an absurdly small probability is bound to happen eventually. But then why do we never factor that in and  always just call it a day with 10000^7?",1454377716

Once I learned how to do this, my response rate for emails jumped substantially and thankfully, it&#x27;s not hard.<p>The two areas that are the fastest to focus on optimizing are the subject line and the organization of the message body.<p>Subject lines need to be informative and explain exactly what you&#x27;re getting when you open the message.<p>&quot;Hi, I&#x27;m a big fan!&quot; (email about how you&#x27;d like to meet them for coffee)<p>vs.<p>&quot;Hi, I&#x27;d like to buy a cup of coffee and meet you on <date>&quot;<p>Second, make the email as short as possible and communicate exactly what you want up front, as quickly as possible (talking first 2-3 sentences). People have limited time to process email and many hate spending their days chained to their mail client to the point we try to get it done ASAP. Save them time and tell the recipient what you&#x27;d like the outcome to be within the first 2-3 sentences. &quot;I&#x27;d like to meet you for coffee on DATE/TIME and discuss X, my treat. Are you available?&quot; or &quot;I enjoyed your work on Y and would like to interview you for an article. Are you available to chat DATE/TIME on the phone?&quot; etc. Maximize your ask and minimize the amount of thinking they need to undertake to process it. Sometimes emails do require longer explanations for context or the reason for contacting, but that still needs to go below the initial CTA. Putting a ton of context before the CTA forces people to spend a lot of time reading your email to figure out what you want and they&#x27;re more likely to just delete it.<p>Even if you get writing emails figured out, there&#x27;s no guarantee people will respond. I&#x27;ve sent hundreds of cold contact emails before to individuals, businesses, and other organizations and watched them disappear into the ether regardless. Ultimately, people are busy, they might not be interested in your email or what you&#x27;re talking about, their spam filters might have eaten your message, they want to respond and forget to do it and you get buried under the next hundred messages, the dog chewed the ethernet cable to the SMTP server just as your email was on the wire and your message got corrupted in transit, the list of reasons is endless. Ultimately, email is asynchronous communication by design and people will handle it differently. It&#x27;s frustrating when you don&#x27;t get a timely response and you can choose to either send them another message or accept it as the cost of communication and move on.",1454377538

With that caveat in mind, here is my experience from hiring programmers over a couple of decades.<p>Good programmers from elite schools are in high demand and can ask for relatively high salaries.  When I have been working in companies with big budgets, I can get good programmers from elite schools.  When I have been working in companies with smaller budgets, I can&#x27;t.<p>However, as you infer, I don&#x27;t find a big difference in the quality of new graduates based on the school that they went to.  Overall they seem to have a very similar gradient of ability.  The schools can differ on what they concentrate on, but I have found that good quality programmers suck up everything around them anyway.  Whatever they missed at school they have either independently worked on, or are keen to learn after school.<p>From a hiring point of view, I actually target people from lesser known schools simply because there seems to be a higher percentage of good people available.  Obviously from a getting hired perspective, you will have a greater chance of working on a team with a big budget right out of school if you go to an elite school.<p>One thing I learned when I worked as a teacher: good students need very little in the way of instruction.  Point them in a direction and give them freedom to learn.  That will give you the best results.  In fact I have been fortunate to work with several really marvellous programmers who were self-taught (though I don&#x27;t recommend that approach for most people -- it&#x27;s hard to focus and to know what is best to concentrate on).<p>From my perspective, an elite school is ideal if you are hoping to make contacts and to go to a big famous company right out of school.  If your goal is to learn, then you can save a HUGE amount of money by choosing a less prestigious school.  I graduated with no debt (admittedly I worked programming for various professors all through school).  It takes a pretty big difference in starting salary to offset that kind of advantage.",1454377509

Life on Earth propagates as much as possible. It is only external factors (mostly resources, but also predation and other factors) which keep populations in check. This is likely a shared trait of all (successful) life in the universe. This doesn&#x27;t preclude the possibility of a species moving beyond this trait* but it does suggest that either the trait fails at some point prior to stellar engineering or interstellar colonization or that <i>all</i> advanced civilizations move beyond it.<p>2. Even if spreading throughout the universe is not a species&#x27; goal, whatever their goals are will require energy. It is likely those goals will require greater and greater energies as our own goals have and will continue to do for the foreseeable future. The only way I see around this problem is novel physics which seem impossible in our current understanding of the universe.<p>3. At some point every species must leave their host star or perish. (However, if they find themselves around a red dwarf, they will have quite a bit of time - and will not have to have moved since the beginning of the universe. So it may be we are freaks because we are around a shorter-lived orange star.)<p>But this is speculation at best. I&#x27;d rather speculate that they all created their own pocket universes that are ideally suited to their species and left the rest of us behind. :)<p>*Although I would suggest that natural selection is an unlikely candidate for the development of such a trait. In my opinion, this would require directly modification of whatever passes for DNA in the species. Even enforced population controls would probably not be enough to contain a species.",1454376219

Recently started playing Torchlight 2 again to get that same leveling up my appearance effect.<p>As someone who does digital marketing for a living, I&#x27;m not only acutely aware of all the tricks they are using, but also the &quot;shallow graphic layer on top of numbers&quot; as you described it.  Sometimes I can even visualize it kind of like Neo in the Matrix.<p>Initially there might be some stimulus for me, but it tends to wear off quickly and that has been my big issue with finding a good long-term game to sink my teeth into.  It also is incidentally the reason why Casinos hold no appeal.  I tried slots once and the moment my brain registered that I didn&#x27;t need to wait for the wheel to spin, and I could hit the button as quickly as I wanted to generate the results, I thought &quot;wow, this is like a game with absolutely shitty graphics I have to keep paying for that has no skill involved.&quot; And just like that I had zero interest in Casinos.<p>So I see all this going on in my head, but then there are things like Dungeon Robber[1] that for some reason keep attracting me back. And they literally give you the tables and such for the dice rolls as they are occurring. There is even less of a veneer of graphics on top of the numbers (although in this case I love D&D and I think it reminds me of my younger tabletop days).<p>That is what makes a lot of this stuff insidious for those that are less self-aware.

11017034,comment,11008340,11016678,0,0,NamTaf,,,"There was a derailment in Australia called the Waterfall derailment [1]. It occurred because the driver had a heart attack and was responsible for 7 deaths (a miracle it was so low, honestly). The root cause was the failure of the dead-man&#x27;s switch.<p>In the case of Waterfall, the driver had 2 dead-man switches he could use - 1) the throttle handle had to be held against a spring at a small rotation, or 2) a bar on the floor could be depressed. You had to do 1 of these things, the idea being that you prevent wrist or foot cramping by allowing the driver to alternate between the two. Failure to do either triggers an emergency brake.<p>It turns out that this driver was fat enough that when he had a heart attack, his leg was able to depress the pedal enough to hold the emergency system off. Thus, the dead-man&#x27;s system never triggered with a whole lot of dead man in the driver&#x27;s seat.<p>I can&#x27;t quite remember the specifics of the system at Waterfall, but one method to combat this is to require the pedal to be held halfway between released and fully depressed. The idea being that a dead leg would fully depress the pedal so that would trigger a brake, and a fully released pedal would also trigger a brake. I don&#x27;t know if they had that system but certainly that&#x27;s one approach used in rail.<p>Either way, the problem is equally possible in cars. If you lose consciousness and your foot goes limp, a heavy enough leg will be able to hold the pedal down a bit depending on where it&#x27;s positioned relative to the pedal and the leverage it has on the floor.<p>The other major system I&#x27;m familiar with for ensuring drivers are alive at the helm is called &#x27;vigilance&#x27;. The way it works is that periodically, a light starts flashing on the dash and the driver has to acknowledge that. If they do not, a buzzer alarm starts sounding. If they still don&#x27;t acknowledge it, the train brakes apply and the driver is assumed incapacitated. Let me tell you some stories of my involvement in it.<p>When we first started, we had a simple vigi system. Every 30 seconds or so (for example), the driver would press a button. Ok cool. Except that then drivers became so hard-wired to pressing the button every 30 seconds that we were having instances of drivers falling asleep/dozing off and still pressing the button right on every 30 seconds because it was so ingrained into them that it was literally a subconscious action.<p>So we introduced random-timing vigilance, where the time varies 30-60 seconds (for example) and you could only acknowledge it within a small period of time once the light started flashing. Again, drivers started falling asleep/semi asleep and would hit it as soon as the alarm buzzed, each and every time.<p>So we introduced random-timing, task-linked vigilance and that finally broke the back of the problem. Now, the driver has to press a button, or turn a knob, or do a number of different activities and they must do <i>that</i> randomly-chosen activity, at a randomly-chosen time, for them to acknowledge their consciousness. It was only at that point that we finally nailed out driver alertness.<p>My point is that human-machine interfaces are really difficult to hammer out edge-cases in. Human behaviour is tough to deal with programmatically.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_rail_accident"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_rail_accident</a>\n[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_man&#x27;s_switch#Vigilance_control"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_man&#x27;s_switch#Vigilance_co...</a>",1454375224

That, right there, prevents it from being a production-ready language.  I could omit the rest of this post and I&#x27;d be right.<p>Scheme does have continuable exceptions, but it&#x27;s still a far cry from Lisp&#x27;s conditions and restarts.<p>Scheme&#x27;s type system is extraordinarily lightweight.  There&#x27;s no way for the user to define new types, nor even a lightweight way to query for an object&#x27;s type (unless I&#x27;ve missed something, one must use the various type predicates one-by-one).<p>Relatedly, there&#x27;s no way to declare variable or function types; no way to pass that information on to an optimising compiler.  There are no compiler macros.  Indeed, compilation in general is woefully underspecified.<p>There&#x27;s no object-orientation: no classes, no generic functions, none of that.  One has to roll one&#x27;s own if one wishes to.<p>Although it does have cond-expand, unlike Lisp Scheme doesn&#x27;t specify <i>READ-SUPRESS</i> which works in conjunction with #+ and #- to skip variant syntax supported by other implementations.<p>This raises the issue of the reader in general.  Scheme&#x27;s reader is not extensible; it lacks reader macros.  It provides no access to the current readtable, or any way to manipulate it.<p>Scheme doesn&#x27;t even have a general (i.e., unhygienic) macro facility!  Its hygienic macros are sufficient for many use cases, but not all — e.g. anaphoric macros.<p>Its iteration construct (yes, singular!) is severely limited.  There&#x27;s no general facility like LOOP.<p>It lacks settable places (this is the capability in Lisp of writing `(setf (getf &#x27;foo bar) &#x27;baz)`).<p>Scheme does finally have dynamic variables, although they are more unwieldy to use than Lisp&#x27;s specials.<p>I do like its well-specified numeric tower.<p>> Modern Schemes like Chicken have fairly extensive collections of practical libraries and features that barebones Scheme implementations lack.<p>But they require that for even very basic functionality (like hashtables!).  One of Common Lisp&#x27;s downfalls is having to use implementation-specific functionality; Scheme is worse.<p>A related problem with Lisp is that Gray streams aren&#x27;t part of the standard. But Scheme&#x27;s ports are even less-specified than Lisp&#x27;s streams.<p>> To add to that, Scheme is far more elegant than CL, and doesn&#x27;t contain all of the ancient crud of CL, so is far more pleasant and easy to program in.<p>You know what I find pleasant?  A language which anticipates my needs and my problems, and has already solved them.  Time and time again I find that Common Lisp has done exactly that.<p>I&#x27;ll certainly admit that there are parts of Lisp I&#x27;d change (the default upcasing is hideous; some of the function names are ugly; the varying argument order between similar functions is beyond lame).  But I&#x27;d never want to use a language which treats NIL as true!<p>Scheme&#x27;s not really a toy: it&#x27;s clay which can be used by thinkers as well as students to play with problems.

The bottom line is that it is not accurate or reliable enough. This is why all commercial uses of GPS have a backup mechanism of some sort, and indeed most navigation is far less reliant on GPS than people believe (e.g. airplanes continue to make extensive use of VOR and ILS). Ships at sea are perhaps the only environment in which satellite positioning is sometimes relied on exclusively, and of course as soon as they are near any other object (land, another ship) they rely on visual navigation for safety.<p>The problem with the rail network is figuring out this backup system.",1454374987

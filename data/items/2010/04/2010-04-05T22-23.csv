The main one being that people didn't understand what I was doing, and I couldn't have hired another programmer if I wanted to.  I also developed it from scratch because I didn't want to bother with writing bindings (but that was also to learn more about graphics).  Also, I feared that the GC would make it too slow, and in the end, it was hard to control what the GC was doing.  It worked out pretty well, but although it runs decently fast, the GC still incurs a pretty hard performance hit.<p>All said, I would do it again in a heartbeat, but I would probably make bindings to an existing framework and use it more as a lightweight scripting language.  That way, the GC isn't run as often, and a lot of developers would be familiar at least with the API.",1270507424

Self-powered hubs must provide 500 ma at each downstream port.  Bus-powered hubs must provide 100 ma at each downstream port.<p>There are also two kinds of devices: high-power and low-power devices, meaning that they consume from their upstream port more than 100 ma  or 100 ma or less, respectively.<p>A bus-powered hub is a high-powered device, as from a port point of view, 500 ma can go down the cable to it (and devices connected to it).<p>The maximum number of ports that a bus-powered hub can provide is 4 as 400 ma are required for each downstream port and the hub functionality uses some power.<p>You cannot plug a bus-powered hub (a high power device as it can consume 500 ma from its upstream port) to a bus-powered hub.  You can of course alternate between self- and bus-powered hubs.<p>If the iPad can operate on 100 ma, then it can be connected to a bus-powered hub.  If it requires more power, then it must be connected to a self-powered hub.<p>Hope this helps.<p>On a historical note, Apple has built systems that provide more than 500 ma from the root (the ports in the system itself).

In particular, reviewing one patch at a time becomes painful very quickly. Especially for complex features that end up having many changesets, because it&#x27;s difficult to review what was changed in the newest changeset.<p>I would prefer having a branch to review rather than a single patch. When there are fixes, add a new commit to the branch and squash/rebase before merging to master. This way it would be easier to see what is happening during the development of a more complex feature with many rounds of review and fixing.<p>(note: we might not be using the latest version of Gerrit and our version control practices could be better)",1399280393

(If yes – how to implement?)",,"I am author of a key-value database library (http://hamsterdb.com) which is released under the Apache license (open source, free to use for commercial applications etc). And I just finished working on my commercial add-on product, the &quot;pro&quot; version which is closed source and for paying customers. hamsterdb&#x27;s design is similar to a column-store, and the pro version has additional features like compression, SIMD, encryption (there will be more in the future).<p>Now I wonder if I need to offer a trial version for evaluation purposes for the pro version, and if yes - how? hamsterdb is a C/C++ library with many dependencies to libc and other system libraries. Publishing pre-built libraries will work on Windows and maybe MacOS, but other systems like linuxes and embedded platforms will be extremely difficult.<p>My first idea is to release the 30day evaluation version in source, but heavily obfuscate the sources. However, after a few days of trying to get everything running, I had to realize that the obfuscation tools are either very immature, no longer maintained or way too expensive.<p>So maybe I should not release an evaluation license at all, but simply allow buyers to get a refund after 30 days? In that case I am not able to protect my IP, and people can continue using the pro version after the refund. Also, refunding means that there will be additional transaction costs for international money transfers, which can be quite costly. But I have zero development/maintenance effort, which would be very nice and lets me focus on the core features.<p>Now i&#x27;m kind of lost and not sure which way to go.

Eventually PBS also took control of all credit cards by Danish card holders including Visa and MasterCard through arrangements with said credit card companies.<p>Eventually PBS got privatised and joined with the Norwegian equivalent and became Nets (yes, the name is stupid).  Nets - in Denmark at least - has access to all credit card transactions by Danish credit card holders.<p>At least since 1996, Se og Hør has been doing something like this, but it was not until 2008 the process got streamlined.  Effectively they paid an IBM employee (because Nets had outsourced that department to IBM Denmark) 10.000 DKK a month to trace credit cards and send journalists at Se og Hør updates when specific cards were in use.<p>In addition to celebrities, royals and politicians, also regular persons were targeted in cases related to murder, traffic accidents and so forth.<p>In 2008, the use of this information meant that a Se og Hør journalist knew the heir and his wife bought a ticket to Canada, so he could be on the same plane (much to the surprise of the Prince).<p>In addition to the data originating from Nets, it is now clear that Se og Hør had sources at SAS (Scandinavian Airlines) and the CPH airport, so they could verify the passenger lists for each flight.  And that&#x27;s how the journalist managed to be on the right plane.<p>Moreover, it is now apparent that not only journalists at Se og Hør were aware of it, but also editors and owners as well.

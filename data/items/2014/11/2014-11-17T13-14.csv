You just open the debugger, view the network resources, click play, sort by size, right click the one that is growing (the video), get the curl, paste it into a terminal with a -o flag, and now you have the video.

8618164,comment,8614516,8616957,0,0,paganel,,,"> This is a great article but I wish it would have also included advancement in area of steroids.<p>My thoughts exactly. I was a great fan of professional cycling when I was a kid (I still follow it, mostly for the scenery nowadays), so much so that as an Miguel Indurain fan I still remember the 8-man chase in the 1996 Tour de France that saw his reign end (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xsXthk4YIo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xsXthk4YIo</a>). Each and every one of those 8 athletes from that legendary chase has been proved as being doped sometimes during their career (and most probably they all were doped during that stage). It has not been proved yet, but it&#x27;s an open secret that Indurain itself might have been a doper, and even Merckx. This ruined professional cycling for me.<p>Two years after that 1996 Tour the Festina scandal started and at least cycling did try to make itself clean. The same cannot be said of football, where it&#x27;s absolutely incredible how players like Messi and Ronaldo can play 60+ matches per year at such a high level, consistently. By &quot;incredible&quot; I mean &quot;more than human&quot;.",1416232169

I guess different people have different use cases.<p>I will admit that rather than learn the right command to have curl print to file -- when I _do_ want to write to file, I do use wget (and appreciate it&#x27;s default progress bar; there&#x27;s probably some way to make curl do that too, but I&#x27;ve never learned it either).<p>When I want writing to stdout, I reach for curl, which is most of the time. (Also for pretty much any bash script use, I use curl; even if I want write to a file in a bash script, I just use `>` or lookup the curl arg).<p>It does seem odd that I use two different tools, with mostly entirely different and incompatible option flags -- rather than just learning the flags to make curl write to a file and/or to make wget write to stdout.  I can&#x27;t entirely explain it, but I know I&#x27;m not alone in using both, and choosing from the toolbox based on some of their default behaviors even though with the right args they can probably both do all the same things. Heck, in the OP the curl author says they use wget too -- now I&#x27;m curious if it&#x27;s for something that the author knows curl doesn&#x27;t do, or just something the author knows wget will do more easily!<p>To me, they&#x27;re like different tools focused on different use cases, and I usually have a feel for which is the right one for the job. Although it&#x27;s kind of subtle, and some of my &#x27;feel&#x27; may be just habit or superstition!  But as an example, recently I needed to download a page and all it&#x27;s referenced assets (kind of like browsers will do with a GUI; something I only very rarely have needed to do), and I thought &quot;I bet wget has a way to do this easily&quot;, and looked at the man page and it did, and I have no idea if curl can do that too but I reached for wget and was not disappointed.",1416232139

There are lot of warts, and having actually built things in both Ember.js and Angular.js, I would have to say that I much prefer Angular.js.<p>For example, &quot;Silent Errors&quot; is spot-on. One example of an error (technically Ember-Data, but they are pretty much joined at the hip):<p><pre><code>  1. Save data for a particular model.
  2. The data actually gets sent to the API and saved.
  3. The API returns the updated model data.
  4. Ember.js fails to load the updated data.

Turns out that the model was created with `store.createRecord(&#x27;ModelName&#x27;)` instead of `store.createRecord(&#x27;modelName&#x27;)`. Adding the capitalization to the first letter failed to raise any errors and worked in all but one place in the code.

To do so is a subsidy to economic idleness and a promotion of investment in fiat instead of the real economy.<p>Money doesn&#x27;t have intrinsic value. It should not artificially be made to seem like it keeps so much value by governments.

The hard part, is that they seemingly are capable of participating in that market as it transitions, but they are probably not optimized for this new market, and in this winner takes the majority way of technology, they will get beat 100% of the time.  Let&#x27;s consider the history of companies, and technology.<p>When computers were large, and only government and fortune 500&#x27;s could afford them IBM was a dominate force.  When they got cheaper/more common.  They still participated, but Microsoft came to dominate this new particular market.  As Bill gates himself said, the hardware was now a commodity (but not for IBM&#x27;s customers) it was the software that was valuable.  It took a different company culture to rule that market.<p>In mobile, hardware has not been successfully made into a commodity.  Apple as a mobile company looked more like IBM as a mainframe company.  So far they&#x27;ve done a great job at sticking to their niche.  They excel at making consumer friendly hardware devices, with supporting software.<p>Google obviously has mastered building free cloud services for consumers, however they seem to fail in every endeavor that&#x27;s different.  They struggle to understand people as people, and really haven&#x27;t developed a company culture to build great products for them.<p>I think Microsoft is making progress on reducing the scope of sub optimal market&#x27;s they are attacking, and is currently in the process of defining a culture to attack this new narrower scope.

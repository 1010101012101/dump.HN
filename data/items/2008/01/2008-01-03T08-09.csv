It's more than just an object file;  RNA molecules are exceedingly complicated ""programs"" in and of themselves.<p>DNA gets transcribed into RNA, and from there, a whole universe of interactions takes place, for which we're only beginning to understand a few.  The ribosome is an excellent example:  it's a <i>huge</i> protein/RNA complex, which is also an enzyme responsible for enabling the second part of the central dogma.  The closest analogy I can think of would be something like the source for an embedded language interpreter -- the cellular machinery compiles some genomic code, producing a machine which then has the ability to interpret <i>other</i> parts of the genome, in a different language.<p>Of course, the more we learn, the more these crude analogies break down.  For example, it's becoming increasingly clear that the three-dimensional structure of the DNA and RNA molecules play a critical role in determining their function and regulation;  this, in turn, is regulated partially by their sequence.  There's really no equivalent analogy to this phenomenon in the computer world.<p>There were lots of other niggly errors (e.g. ""GC"" is hardly a universal ""comment code"" for the genome), but on the whole, a decent set of analogies.",1199349915

It takes a magnifying glass, a good soldering iron, and a very steady hand. Interesting article, though!",1199348361

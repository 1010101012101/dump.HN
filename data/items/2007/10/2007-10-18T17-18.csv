69805,comment,69763,69788,0,0,karzeem,,,"Exactly.  Algorithms are simply ways of approaching and solving a problem, and the ability to devise clever ones is portable between disciplines.  At my college, several professors in the CS department hadn't programmed anything since the '70s.<p>The balkanization of science and liberarl arts is probably the worst thing about university education today.

I've managed to write some functionality that was scheduled to take a month in a weekend (I'd figure most programmers have at some point), and it definitely didn't come back to bite me in the ass at all.  If this is what happens, get another job.  Someone else will be more than happy to hire you.  ",1192727971

The long tail of integrating with the management systems those salons use is really long and it&#x27;s basically a non-starter without management system integration.

10089823,comment,10086021,10089401,0,0,bryans,,,"> Sending an HTTP request is much more like asking sears to send you the catalogue for this season. It&#x27;s a REQUEST, they can REFUSE.<p>You&#x27;re completely ignoring the technological factors in delivering content online. If you were arguing that your ad blocker made the server aware of its usage via the HTTP request&#x27;s headers, and the server could use that information to deny a request, then you might have a legitimate basis for your argument. But it doesn&#x27;t, and you don&#x27;t.<p>> They might include stuff you don&#x27;t want in the catalogue, but you can just rip them out.<p>Exactly. You just made my argument for me. You received the content, and decided to ignore other content which you didn&#x27;t want to see after it has already been delivered. You have paid the price of admission by accepting the document as the creator intended. But when you prevent the other content from showing up in the first place, you have entered into the world of immorality. You&#x27;re demanding content be delivered the way <i>you</i> want it, at the <i>literal financial expense</i> of its creator, which is absurd.<p>> And with HTTP requests, I&#x27;m even paying for the bandwidth via my ISP! When they answer to my request, they cost me money, just like I&#x27;m costing them money.<p>That&#x27;s an entirely illogical comparison. You made the request with the complete understanding that when you navigate to a website, it will serve the content to you, and that the request for that content knowingly costs them money, and costs you money. <i>But it&#x27;s entirely at your request</i>. You are paying your ISP for the <i>capability</i> to make that request, and nobody forced you to make it or pay for it. So when you do make the request but block the ads, you are forcing the content creator to pay for it, and then refusing them their ability to recoup that cost. You are not paying the content creator by paying your ISP. It&#x27;s an illegitimate comparison.",1440039197

It is also extremely well known that some journals advertise &quot;In print in two months or less!&quot; Inside the field (so to the people who will give you the next contract), it&#x27;s obvious where you publish.<p>In some cases, it _is_ very valuable to put the extra months of effort in to lay down a rock solid piece. For example, in CAS, you can make an extra 10,000 RMB for publishing in a low impact Indian or Chinese journal. You can make upwards of 100,000 RMB (a full year&#x27;s salary) for publishing in one of the &quot;big four&quot; journals. And up to 3 years salary for getting a Nature or Science publication. This is money being invested by the Chinese government to intentionally combat the plague of falsified Chinese research. I don&#x27;t know of any other country or system that does this. It is also remarkably easy to get tenure in China, which allows a lot of long-term type focus. But this is a tiny bubble for China as it attempts to brain drain the rest of the world and is not likely to continue for long.<p>It&#x27;s a big problem that the media doesn&#x27;t understand which are which. For example when everyone was raving about the &quot;faster than light&quot; neutrinos a few years ago the first thing _every single person_ in my building said was &quot;The Italians set their clock wrong didn&#x27;t they?&quot; Half a joke, but dead serious that no one should even consider this until it showed up in a publication.<p>Another big problem is that only basing your research on verifying others research is suicide for an academic career sing you&#x27;re intentionally doing _low impact_ science. The only people willing to fund that are people with agendas, ie. BP, Exxon, Coca Cola etc.",1440039022

The analogy isn&#x27;t perfect, but math often describes things in the world, and we can use those things to provide windows to the math itself.<p>While the language of math is a useful tool for the initiated, like all linguistic barriers it keeps out newcomers. So yes, we must teach people math, but we must do it at first, as much as possible, in a language that allows them to <i>enter</i> into a new way of thinking.

I really don&#x27;t think that there are many good reasons to spend 10 years on <i>one thing</i> when there is a substantial risk of failure. Scientists spend 10 years on problems all the time! But it&#x27;s either part time, or has measurable metrics for progress along the way that can be published.  I mean, you try to go to the moon before Pluto, right?  Science (as an institution) is really a lot more like Tetris than people think, except some of the blocks (publications) get moved or destroyed later. But if the blocks are smaller, they&#x27;re much easier to fit together and build upon, and fault tolerant and so forth, so if they blow up it&#x27;s less of a big deal. Smaller, more well-defined and robust studies are generally better.<p>To change analogies to paths instead of blocks, which is a better description of the decision making a scientist goes through (rather than building the edifice of human knowledge), it&#x27;s a lot more like finding your way through a new city than choosing two paths in a snowstorm that will not encounter anything for 10 years&#x27; walk. At every fork, you have to decide where to go and there will be some reason you have made that choice. After some smaller period, you can if you choose report where you&#x27;ve gotten and why. Other people care! They will be happy to read about it, as long as your logic is pretty good, especially if you make nice observations along the way. You can publish this, and probably no one will steal it from you. Maybe someone will... but if you do it right, do it incrementally and let people know what you&#x27;re up to, you&#x27;ll at least have your batshit ideas published as unreviewed abstracts and folks will know who made the first progress.",1440037733

But there is the potential for a buyer to have &quot;successor liability&quot; under certain circumstances. Usually, it&#x27;s when the sale is really a de facto merger, with continuity in the identities of shareholders. If this was a cash sale of assets, that would not apply here. In some states there are ways to get successor liability when the buyer continues the business of the seller, not in Delaware.<p>Of course the assets were sold for cash, so that&#x27;s in the husk of the company. If that money exists, it&#x27;ll be hard for shareholders and insiders to get it out of the remnant company without running into trouble in the inevitable bankruptcy.

Sure maybe there is a price that changes your mind, but right now there&#x27;s no offer on the table, so leave it off the table. In my opinion, there are a couple of things to keep in mind:<p>1. The &quot;person&quot; who wants the name is a fictitious person, not an actual human individual who deserves consideration as a human being. There&#x27;s no point of &quot;being cool&quot; toward a company, it&#x27;s just out to get what it can: asking for your username is just an example of the ruthless logic under which company&#x27;s operate.<p>2. The value to the company is high enough that they have invested time in approaching you and should you decide to give up your name, will invest all the time in actually transferring it.<p>3. If you do transfer it, don&#x27;t be surprised if the company sells it or does something equally unexpected. Acquiring the name is a business transaction. Nothing more. Nothing less.<p>Finally, if you don&#x27;t care about the name and don&#x27;t want to be bothered, then let it go so you can do something you care about and are willing to be bothered by.<p>Good luck.",1440036572

There are many societies where being outed like this wouldn&#x27;t be a life-threatening situation, so it can be done. Of course, turning a place like Saudi Arabia into one of those societies is somewhat difficult, but it&#x27;s a worthy goal.<p>Hacking a company&#x27;s computers and exposing people&#x27;s private data is also bad, but much harder to change. I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;ll ever achieve decent computer security. Stopping attacks on the other side, by convincing people not to try, is probably also not feasible. So stuff like this will probably keep happening.<p>Then we come to the other end of the private info, where people give it away.

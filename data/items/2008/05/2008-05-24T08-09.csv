That's the real issue - that solidly manufactured stuff got replaced by crap - that has people so touchy about the issue.",1211617515

The problems are political and economical in nature, in my opinion - the technology is there, it's just not utilized well because of all the crap that happens politically.  As one small example, it between ""capital requirements"", and all the fees, it probably costs something like 10000 Euro to create an SrL (limited liability company), whereas in my home state of Oregon, I managed to create one for a little over 100 dollars.  I'm sure you know all this, but many people don't realize how many smart, entrepreneurial people there are in Italy, and only see the results of years of bad policy decisions.<p>Complimenti, in ogni caso:-)  Leaving Perugia wouldn't be an easy decision for anyone - I think that area is one of the most beautiful that I've ever seen, anywhere.",1211617314

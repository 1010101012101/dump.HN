Many established players have gone out of business or balanced at the brink of bankruptcy for several years. The main reasons for this seem to be the explosive nature of digital technology, along with the fact that many firms had a position and a competence base that was rendered obsolete. While digital imaging has both popularized photography and taken it to new heights, this has been accomplished through the destruction of thousands of jobs and entire companies. Chairman Mao once said that “A revolution is not a tea party”. Those people who have worked at Kodak, Polaroid, Hasselblad, Contax, Pentax, Agfa, Leica, Fujifilm, Mamiya, Bronica and Ilford are very well aware of this.",1243792229

At least until about 9 months ago, used hyundais of the post 2005 vintage were steals.<p>hyundais post 2005 are extremely reliable, yet people still feel it has the reputation of a 'unreliable car'. reality is out of sync w/ perception.<p>most people try for a reliable older car w/ a solid reputation. these cars have more miles on them and are, well, marked up b/c many people do this<p>part of the cheapness of hyundai elantras comes from the fact that resale values are absolute garbage for older models. w/ improving brand perception and reliability of the products itself, resale values for post 2005 cars will be much higher than ppl expect.<p>lower popularity means less chance of being stolen compared to an older vintage honda or toyota. i have had my older honda1993 stolen and had the police officer who took down the report brag to me about how he could've stolen my car w/ one hand tied behind his back too.<p>Finally, if you look at the depreciation schedule of an average car (resale value over its lifetime) the steepest drops happen between years 1-3. then it flattens out to about year 10 or so. so best place to buy is year 3 or so, and sell it around year 10-12. (actually cheapest is to run it into the ground)<p>My suggestion:<p>buy a 2005 model hyundai elantra w/ low mileage (old drivers are awesome), with one previous owner only.

To pick some influential folk who fit into that period, consider Babbage, Darwin, Mendel, Pasteur, Boltzmann, Cantor, Semmelweis, the Wright Brothers, and Wegener. Consider also their rivals and critics. (Since I included a number of controversial folk, various of their rivals and critics are still remembered.) We can come up with generalizations about what the influential folk did right, but I don't think it works to say that, e.g., they were scientists while their critics and rivals were amateurs.<p>Or consider all the advice in an essay at the level of Hamming's ""You and your research."" It doesn't seem to me to be useful to try to boil down the multiple properties discussed there into boolean predicates ""is this person a scientist"" or ""is this person an amateur,"" or even to try to choose particular points in those multidimensional property spaces as typifying ""scientist"" or ""amateur"" or ""genius.""<p>I wholeheartedly approve of people writing about some of the principles in this essay, notable the ones often summarized as ""genius is 99% perspiration"" and ""a month in the lab can often save a day in the library."" Those are very important principles, and very often people don't appreciate them enough.

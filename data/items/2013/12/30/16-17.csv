(You probably could find counter examples of course.)<p>Maybe this stems from the fact that the general public doesn&#x27;t typically deal with &quot;computer guys&quot; [1] so they have no need to differentiate them. But they do need plumbers, carpenters and electricians and they know what they are. [2] (And those are also union jobs so that probably also makes titles necessary).<p>[1] How many times have you heard &quot;he does something with computers?&quot;.<p>[2] Maybe this all stems from the fact that there was no central defining authority at any point that made any statement as to what the titles meant. Even in religion there are clearly defined titles, right?  In tech (on the net at least) what do we have? RFC&#x27;s a nice way of asking opinions.",1388422785

6985412,comment,6983182,6984438,2,0,ngkabra,,,"> The problem is more like not teaching the students how to find a reputable path to publication and not weighing the quality of the venue.<p>Actually, in my opinion, most of the students couldn&#x27;t care less about publications. They just want their degree, but the system refuses to let them have it without the publication. Hence they&#x27;re forced to publish at conferences that publish without checking.<p>The problem is indeed with the system that requires publications, and then accepts publications in dodgy conferences. What else can be expected of the students in this situation?",1388422776

6985407,comment,6983182,6983976,1,0,kaitai,,,"What the OP has done certainly does present a poor representation of the academic system, as a corrupt shakedown system that&#x27;s milking students for easy cash. Is this incorrect? No. As you said, we get spam emails for conferences like this -- but if students think it&#x27;s a requirement to publish in order to graduate, why not answer that spam?<p>Corruption is a huge factor in academic publishing, which relatively well-off and well-connected academics in the UK and US may not realize. A lot of countries trying to increase the visibility and prestige of their academic programs have stupid publishing quotas set by bureaucrats that make less-connected or less-knowledgeable academics ripe targets for these scams. Even in Italy, an EU country with a long academic history in mathematics, rules put in place to combat nepotism favor publication rates that are at best simply orthogonal to measuring the quality of a mathematician&#x27;s output. India has tons of new colleges and universities and many young academics trying to prove themselves, as well as a recent influx of state funding.

6985380,comment,6984944,6985189,4,0,mikestew,,,"> However, now I am stuck between choosing between what is good for ME and what is good for OTHERS. What is more important?<p>Question of the ages, that is. I tend toward contributing toward the general good as best I know how. But I came to that conclusion through a fair bit of contemplation, some selfish living (which still continues in degrees), and philosophical and religious thought. (And I&#x27;m still no Ghandi, I can play the part of &quot;self-centered asshole&quot; pretty well, and regularly.) In short, it&#x27;s a journey you get to take all on your own, no one else will figure it out for you.<p>Keep in mind, too, that the two choices you laid out are not at odds with each other. As a personal example, I volunteer at an animal shelter. My wife and I walk homeless dogs, pick up their poop, and take some to training classes if it would make them more adoptable. For dogs that have been there a while, we&#x27;ll take them on field trips to the park, maybe stop by Wendy&#x27;s for a burger and fries. We&#x27;ll each put in at least 100, sometimes over 200 hours/year there. We give the shelter arse loads of money (yea, high tech salaries!) We do it because we believe if we (society) have domesticated the animals, we have a responsibility to see that they are taken care of and treated humanely. Damned noble of us, eh? Except I find it to be a hell of a lot of fun to hang out with the mutts, teach them commands so that they&#x27;re civilized members of society, go run around in the mud at the park, and ultimately see them get adopted. It ain&#x27;t all selfless.<p>Dishing up food at a homeless shelter? Makes you feel good, right? That you&#x27;re doing the &quot;right&quot; thing? It&#x27;s still about you, because of how it makes you feel, or that you think that <i>you</i> are doing what&#x27;s &quot;right&quot;. Ultimately you should be removed entirely, and it&#x27;s done because it&#x27;s what the world needs right now. I&#x27;m still a long way from that ideal, but I keep trying. In the mean time at least some effort is expended toward making the world a little better, whatever the motivation may be.",1388422441
6985379,comment,6984944,6985191,0,0,VLM,,,"I suspect that when a car accident means a loss of 450 years of life instead of 45 years we&#x27;ll probably end up requiring cars to be ten times safer, or roads to be inherently safer, or since we have all the time in the world, maybe no need to ever drive above 10 MPH other than recreational use.<p>This is a problem often not discussed about the utopia of a world filled with self driving cars... its very hard to make an AI that can handle 85 MPH on a crowded interstate, but once &quot;everyone&quot; has a self driving car, we&#x27;ll probably just lean back and watch TV/movies/podcasts or do desk work or whatever so going 10 MPH is fine, at which point its not so hard of an AI problem anymore.  So there&#x27;s a hump to break thru after which the tech gets a lot simpler and lower risk.<p>Also the nature hike at the park is a wee bit less risky than hiking Mt Everest.

6985378,comment,6985207,6985207,19,0,GuiA,,,"Python 3 came from a good place, and it definitely fixes many problems that sorely needed fixing, but it was doomed to failure from the start (and many developers said that in 2008 already).<p>For all intents and purposes, Python 3 is pretty much a new, separate programming language. Sure, it&#x27;s very close to Python 2.x, but you don&#x27;t have out of the box retro-compatibility  so that pretty much kills it right there.<p>Python 2.x is so huge in terms of its use around the world and available libraries and resources for it that you just can&#x27;t say &quot;hey, the new version of Python will in practice break everything&quot; and expect it to fly.<p>I love Python and the community around it (and have several packages on pypi myself), but Python 3 is a joke.<p>If we didn&#x27;t want to kid ourselves, we&#x27;d kill Python 3 and back port the interesting features, like Alex suggests.

6985377,comment,6985207,6985207,5,0,dekhn,,,"I used Python 3 for the first time a few days ago (I&#x27;ve been programming in Python for 18 years).  When I used python heavily (I&#x27;ve switched back to C++ and now Go) I depended a lot on a small number of really good libraries- ElementTree, NumPy, SciPy, etc.  Unless/until all of those get ported to Python 3 (along with hundreds of other programs), and those ports are considered Correct (in the QA validation sense), it&#x27;s hard for me to consider wholesale conversion.<p>I did it because I was trying to parse Unicode in XML (Apple iTunes music files) and Python 2 is completely broken when it comes to unicode.<p>I consider Python 3 a big &quot;fuck you&quot; from Guido to the community.  I don&#x27;t think he intended it to be so, but the effect of the long transition, and the lack of backported features in Python 2 (which could be easily accomodated), coupled with only limited adoption of Python3, demonstrate the leadership needs to pay closer attention to user pain.<p>Finally, I don&#x27;t think Python will ever address the simple and most important core issue: lacking good multithreading support will make the language continue to be more and more marginal.  CPUs aren&#x27;t getting much faster, the CPython serial runtime isn&#x27;t getting any faster.  Multiple cores on a single chip, and multiple threads in a core, are getting more numerous- and not being able to take advantage of them using the obvious, straightforward memory-sharing, multi-threaded techniques the chips are design to run well- is just a clear ignorance of the future of computing designs.<p>I switched back from Python to C++ when shared_ptr and unique_ptr, along with std::map and std::vector became standard enough that programming in C++ became easy: convenient memory management, and maps/vectors are the two things that C++ adds to C that are valuable.  Then I switched to Go because C++ compilation times are so bad, and writing high quality concurrent code is hard.",1388422418

6985361,comment,6984077,6984077,1,0,actsasbuffoon,,,"I dropped out of high school and college. In my youth I was entirely too stubborn and arrogant for being told what to do. I worked some crappy jobs for a few years (fast food, retail, etc.), and I was miserable. I had no money, no insurance, and people were still telling me what to do.<p>I got an entry level job in a data center when I was ~20 years old. The work was boring; mostly physical labor. Management realized how bored I was, but saw some potential in me. I was rapidly promoted several times, eventually making my way into a junior developer position. The pay was still terrible, and a lot of the other developers looked down on me.<p>Eventually the company ran into some financial difficulties and I was laid off. As luck would have it, I was scheduled for an interview the very next day. Things went well and I was hired on the spot. It was one of the most stressful and rewarding periods of my career. The pay was still terrible, but I was the only developer. Every decision was mine to make, and I made as many bad ones as good. I learned a lot about writing stable code (since I was the only person available to clean up the mess).<p>After working there for two years I got tired of the bad pay. I went to a meet-up and got to know a couple of developers. I earned the respect of a few, which was my first foray into professional networking. The VP of one company said he wanted to hire me and asked how much money I was looking for. At the time I was only making $36k per year, so I figured $85k would be a decent number. He pulled me aside and suggested I ask him for $105k instead. That should give you some idea of how strange and enjoyable it was working for him.<p>That job was a wonderful learning experience. For the first time I was surrounded by people who really knew what they were doing. No one looked down on me or questioned my lack of degree. Even though some of these people had a decade more experience than me, we ran the place like a democracy. I have also never seen management that was so understanding of the development process. They understood work would be ready when it was ready, and gave us a lot of creative freedom.<p>Fast forward a couple of years and now I&#x27;m at another company. I have a pretty nice title, and my salary has continued to climb. I&#x27;m considered to be the company&#x27;s foremost expert in my specific technology, and I&#x27;m frequently asked to train people. Far from being looked down on, people usually treat me with deference.<p>You can interpret my story however you like, but this is what I&#x27;ve taken away from it:<p>My arrogance forced me to spend a few years working jobs that I hated. I got lucky, a few people saw something in me, and I was given opportunities. I had to prove myself a bit at first, but that got better once I had a few years of experience under my belt. These days I&#x27;ve got an impressive title, a great salary, and people respect my knowledge and abilities.<p>I managed to do pretty well without an education, but it took a lot of hard work and a number of incredibly kind people deciding to take a chance on me. I&#x27;m really happy with the way things turned out, but it&#x27;s hard to imagine life would be worse if I&#x27;d stayed in school.<p>Oh, and people still occasionally tell me what to do.",1388422304

6985358,comment,6983566,6983566,1,0,NumberSix,,,"Git has many problems.<p>(1) Many git commands have many variants that do different, sometimes very different things.<p>(2) There are many different ways, including variants of many different base commands, to do very similar, but not identical things.  These are not aliases for the same action, but rather commands with similar, overlapping, but still different effects.  For example, should I do a &quot;git reset&quot;, &quot;git revert&quot;, &quot;git checkout&quot;, or more complicated acrobatics with branches, merges, rebasing etc. just to discard some work that I don&#x27;t want?<p>(3) One of the many adverse consequences of this is that if you Google how to do many things in Git, you will often find several conflicting answers.  Unless you already know a lot about Git, in which case you don&#x27;t need to Google how to do something in Git, this is very unhelpful.<p>(4) Git uses cryptic 40 character hexadecimal SHA-1 codes to identify commits rather than a sequential numbering system.  This means for example that one cannot tell automatically from two SHA-1 codes which commit or file came before or after the other.<p>(5) Git&#x27;s branching scheme makes it difficult to set up a traditional test/development/production system where a developer can easily checkout the production code for the system except for their sub-system <i>AND</i> the development version of one or more other sub-systems.<p>(6) Git&#x27;s branching system tends to result in work being scattered across dozens of private branches belonging to different developers or teams making integration difficult.<p>(7) Git user interfaces fail to hide the low level, complicated command line interface from users.  Something usually goes wrong that requires reverting to the command line to sort out what happened and fix it.<p>(8) It is difficult to attach human readable names such as &quot;release candidate 1&quot; to git commits.  There are &quot;tags&quot; but by default they are not pushed to remote repositories.  It is possible to set up repositories to block a push with human readable tags; the remote git user lacks permission to push a commit with the tags.<p>(9) Git&#x27;s extreme complexity means it is used in very different ways at different companies and organizations.  Different companies and organizations often add further systems on as wrappers around Git, e.g. the Gerrit code review system.  For example, some Git users essentially never use rebase while others have a process that makes heavy use of rebase.<p>(10) Git enthusiasts usually respond to criticisms such as this by proceeding to explain or attempt to explain some complicated set of acrobatics in Git, often involving several cryptic variants of several commands, that may solve the problem but is impractical to remember and reuse or document.<p>(11) Git uses many different names for the same concept or component of Git such as index and staging area.  This is confusing even after several months of using Git.",1388422291

This would even have the benefit of rendering attacks of the type: &quot;I come with a truck and steal the part of the wall that contains the ATM&quot; impractical (yes, people have done these).<p>And where the only way to prevent that, for example during legitimate maintenance, would be to first enter a token generated by the ATM company and communicated to the (legit) employee doing the maintenance when he&#x27;s working on the machine?<p>I&#x27;ve never worked on ATMs and I&#x27;m sure it shows, but that&#x27;s not the point.<p>Honestly I find it quite sad that simply plugging in an USB stick allows to steal money from the machine.<p>I find it also very sad that several people here consider that &quot;nothing can be done against a rogue employee&quot; or that &quot;nothing can be done if you have physical access to the internal electronics&quot;.<p>And I do honestly hope that people working on ATMs will start thinking about how to better secure their ATMs and which kind of trust systems can be put in place so that rogue employees (and other thieves) have a much harder time attacking ATMs.<p>&quot;It seems to me the failure was using materials that could be quickly breached and then patched.&quot;<p>That is just <i>one</i> failure.

Of course all kinds of things need to be happening inside our heads before we start manipulating symbols. But Feynman&#x27;s papers and books are full of equations and derivations, not just answers. Most of Victor&#x27;s examples are actually counter-examples, because they are examples of problems where a little algebra would not only be faster and easier but would yield a simple formula that you could use later, the next time the problem comes up.<p>Take the book design example. What happens the next time you need to fit a similar graph on the page? If you had used algebra you could have written a little calculator in Python in which you could plug in the new numbers and which would return the solution.

There are many hammer designs, some more general purpose like the claw hammer and many others (tack, 2lb) with a more limited intended purpose.

The paper asserts the complexity of staging is unneeded, but in my view doesn&#x27;t adequately demonstrate that to be true for large teams.  The paper goes on to describe an alternate, simpler product which better meets the needs of simpler users using and alternate, incompatible conceptual design.

Research doctors are not even trying to slay a dragon but a <i>hydra</i>: combat one way to die of old age and another one pops up.<p>Lastly, attempting to forecast &quot;chance of immortality in the coming 60-odd years&quot; is asking a question that relies for its answer on extremely controversial ideas.  Particularly, attempting to answer requires us to forecast whether the rate of advancement in ageing research is speeding up or slowing down.  This is <i>hard</i>, and can be affected by a bunch of different factors: funding breakdown in non-corporate research, Great Stagnation Hypothesis, breakdown in public acceptance of science, economic decline in some places, economic growth in some places, public uptake of anti-aging ideologies, attitudes towards the retirement crisis we&#x27;re already facing even before anti-aging research comes in.  Oh, and then we face the issue of whether we can or are improving our quality of scientific findings through better research training or data science/machine learning techniques.  And then we get to the <i>really</i> out-there stuff &quot;immortalists&quot; are often secretly thinking of and can&#x27;t stop yacking about: the chance that we manage to create Friendly Artificial Intelligence and trigger a Singularity, thus rendering us all immortal utopian transhumans before many of us on this board even hit retirement age.<p>TL;DR: I have no bloody idea, but I still regard contributing to my Roth IRA as a pretty sensible move.<p>EDIT: The one trend I&#x27;m willing to say I observe is that average life expectancy is a fairly good tracker of social and economic development, even once you&#x27;ve gotten over the infant-mortality hump.

6985118,comment,6984273,6984990,3,0,RogerL,,,"I&#x27;m not trying to be waspish, but are you suggesting we just be like Feynman? I will say I&#x27;m rather dubious we can achieve that with a simple interface change.<p>There is certainly merit and utility to graphical representation; we all use it via matlab, python+scientific packages, and so on. And, of course, the faster we can change something and see the result the better. It is not always an incremental change, but a pretty fundamental change, to see something change in real time.<p>Yet, this only really works in tiny cases. I recall Victor demonstrating using scrubbing variables to change how a game reacts. Okay, but the vastest amount of the programming I do (and I do fairly numerical things in the computer vision line) I either don&#x27;t see the utility, or practicality. I can&#x27;t variable scrub my way to a better algorithm.<p>I&#x27;ve seen, for example, graphical demonstrations of things like binary tree algorithms, sorting, and the like. It&#x27;s momentarily interesting, but I can&#x27;t claim that it really made any difference in my understanding of the subject. I think this is a case where people vary. I am not terribly visual, and most of Victor&#x27;s arguments go over like a lead balloon with me. Yet, I cannot deny the excitement of others. I find it far more commodious to work with, for example, linear algebra. Certainly there are times when I am drawing 3D arrows and the like to work out a problem, but by-and-large the symbolic representation serves far better.<p>There is a reason we use text for communication on HN, and not pictures. It is not because we lack vision or foresight (no pun intended), but because it is the most expressive and flexible way to communicate our ideas. And, of course, sometimes we labor away, trying to communicate in words what would be so easy to illustrate with a single image. Neither is &#x27;best&#x27;; we just use the best tool for the job.<p>None of that is to argue against one of your points - that math is more than symbolic representation. Once you are reduced to applying symbolic rules to an equation you are often quite lost, and that is often not taught in schools. Yet so much of math really cannot be done graphically at all, yet we succeed. A lot of people stall out in math (I think) at after the algebra/calc I,II,III level because beyond that there is often no recourse to graphics and physical representations; graphics can be as much a crutch as a help.<p>Anyway, visual thinking is certainly a form of thinking that should not be downplayed, but it is not how some to many brains work, nor is it even possible in many forms of important thought (I leave savants to one side, we can not make decisions based on exceptional/unique people).",1388419702

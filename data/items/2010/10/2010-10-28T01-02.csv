They are mashing together frameworks.</i><p>Usually you have one framework and then you mash together a bunch of libraries.  The framework exists as a way to abstract the most common functionality of your chosen platform.  A good framework eliminates a lot of boilerplate without getting in your way when you need to go beyond the common functionality.<p>The ironic thing about your post is that PHP itself has a bit of a nascent framework quality to it.  It was developed before web frameworks of course, at a time when everyone was writing Perl CGI scripts using a bunch of libraries.  The revolutionary aspect of PHP and mod_php in particular, was that it had automatic hooks into all the common aspects of the HTTP cycle, including the page metaphor, which meant you could change a static page into a dynamic page with no effort. PHP was state of the art when websites were mostly still just pages.  Serious programmers laughed of course, how could you build a serious application in this glorified templating language?  So they continued to develop their ""proper"" frameworks like Struts, Zope and countless others rooted in the experience of GUI developers from ages past.<p>However as web development experience and understanding matured, there was a widening gap between PHP and the enterprise frameworks.  And this gap is squarely where Rails was dropped in 2004.  There are so many things that are common to all web applications that PHP doesn't handle.  DHH's brilliance was not so much in the details of the original Rails code, but in picking and choosing best practices and unifying them in one package in a minimal way.  I think this was instrumental in web framework developers from all languages re-evaluating what was really necessary and what cruft could be eliminated.<p>Nowadays Rails is pretty enterprisey in capability, but it still avoids most of the overhead present in enterprise frameworks of 10 years ago.  The minimalist torch has been carried forward by upstarts such as Merb and now Sinatra.<p>The strength of these various frameworks is that they do things that tens of thousands of developers need to do every day in a standardized way that's had massive input and refinement over time.  When you use these frameworks you can hire people and they hit the ground running.  When you use your own personal library then every new developer has to get up to speed on your dime, and you foot the bill of maintenance yourself rather than gaining the advantage of a large open-source community.",1288231106

1841351,comment,1840470,1841127,0,0,spokey,,,"> It is unethical to use this software on one’s children without letting them know.<p>I disagree. If you had written ""spouse"" or ""significant other"" or really any other adult I'd agree with you, but I don't think you can make that absolute statement when it comes to (minor) children.<p>Letting the child know about the monitoring software would be the good and trusting thing to do, but ""unethical"" overstates the case significantly. I can imagine cases where it would reflect poor judgment or be inappropriate to snoop in this way, but I can readily imagine scenarios where it would be unethical NOT to secretly monitor a child's communication.<p>Part of a parent's job is to keep their children out of trouble until the child is old enough to do that for themselves. (Another part, as you suggest, is teaching the child how to do just that.) Absolute statements about privacy kind of go out the window when you are talking about a relationship and responsibility of that nature.<p>It is not hard to imagine a child (not every child, but certainly some, especially in the ""tween"" age range) that has the capacity and desire to hide some communication from his or her parents but lacking the judgment and life-skills to keep themselves safe from harm when doing so.<p>Suppose your child is engaged in inappropriate or damaging behavior such bullying/being bullied, involved in self-harm/cutting, drug abuse, illegal activities, or things even more sinister. If your child has the desire to hide that activity from you, you could tell your child about the monitoring software but then they'll be careful to find another channel to communicate about this activity.  Alternatively you could not tell them about the software and have some additional insight into their world whether they want you to have it or not.<p>Look, it wouldn't be my first course of action, I wouldn't do it without provocation, and I would be very very careful how I made use of the information, but I wouldn't hesitate to violate my minor child's privacy if I thought it was important to protecting her well being. Monitoring text messages is nothing, I'd read her diary if necessary.",1288230787

And yet, he could not come to terms with me actually doing this. So he asked ""why do you want to goto San Francisco?"". I was already upset and the general tone on the dinner table was pretty heated. I carelessly replied ""because I feel like it."" At the time, it came across as rude though I didn't mean it that way.

Likewise, at the time I did not understand my family's concerns. Over time, I did.

This may be the long term trend, but within that is up and down like you'd expect in the business cycle.  The confusing thing is that those who are buying bonds are bearish about the economy as a whole.  You have to be buying these things thinking they won't be wasteful when interest rates rise.  If interest rates skyrocket like many voices claim they will, those who are holding 0.25% paper are going to be unhappy when they are unloading it at 80 cents on the dollar.<p>His discussion of the matter seems very confused.  The problem with the bond market right now is that there is no inflation, but real returns elsewhere are often negative.  So bonds are a safe place to put money.  It's certainly not being invested.  Now, one can argue whether the Fed has any ability to affect that.  The clock may have run out on quantitative easing, as I have heard argued.  That means the Fed would be somewhat irrelevant and the US economy would falter in the absence of fiscal stimulus.<p>There aren't many voices articulating sense in this discussion.  Many have simply said ""deficits bad"" and called on increasing unemployment as the solution to our concerns.  Good luck with that.  I think the solution probably requires preventing the unemployed from becoming the desperately long-term unemployed, at a minimum, and also using the favorable bond situation to repair infrastructure, which is apparently in huge backlogs across the country.<p>To some extent, I wonder if Bill Gross is really just sort of pandering to his clientele, who are not sophisticated economists and who are happy to agree that politics is full of apes.

You will remain entirely in control of your actions, but the pool of available actions will become smaller and smaller as this continues. Eventually you will reach a point where you no longer can keep up the facade of control and your academics will shift from something that you don't enjoy doing to something that you can't keep up with. As someone intelligent you are likely to rationalize this disengagement / drop in grades by saying that the classes aren't worth your time (or other self-defeating thoughts).

As you can imagine, it's a game-changer and there is significant discussion on how they will be impacted. I think the general conclusion I've gotten is that the situation is still very fluid, and most people in medicine are as confused/uncertain of its effect as most laypoeple.<p>> Could you estimate in rough percentages, if at all: Of your peers in medical school, how many of them are interested in becoming a doctor for purely altruistic reasons?<p>I think there are a variety of factors and influences that cause an individual to want to become a doctor and most medical students aren’t seeking to become martyrs (ie. not purely altruistic). It would be just as simplistic as to say Facebook was founded solely because Zuckerberg wanted create something. While the ability to help people is important factor, the amazing complexity and beauty of the human body, the opportunity to work in a constantly changing, dynamic environment, the ability to apply science, and the respectability of the profession are also motivators. I would say, in many ways and to most med students, these factors outweigh the financial rewards (if that's what you meant by non-altruistic reasons).<p>> How many defaulted to med school because it is something appropriate for intelligent people and pleases their parents?<p>I think that is an incredibly difficult question to answer, but I will try to rationalize my non-answer. It is slightly difficult (no exaggeration :P) to get into medical school – if a person is not motivated or passionate, it is difficult to simply default into medical school. That said, this question goes back to the previous question about motives and incentives. I would say a significant proportion of my classmates have a significant experience with physicians – either as a patient or having relatives who are physicians. Whether having physician parents and that it might “please their parents” is an important factor, I wouldn’t know as I did not have that kind of background.<p>I personally do not think that “defaulting” is a common occurrence because at my school, there is a large proportion of non-traditional applicants who have had previous careers. With classmates ranging from former investment bankers, Olympic swimmers, opera singers, and park rangers, I imagine they methodically thought about the opportunity cost of changing careers. Too bad we don’t have many former developers. :) For better or worse, medicine is a desirable profession, and I would venture to guess that a lot of people will at least try or consider a career in medicine. Without then actually developing passion or interest, medicine is a tough path to continue.",1288228369

I think to some people, the immediate thought is that the interviewer would deduct points for originality if you said ""well let's just use this tool off of the shelf"".<p>This is why interviews are so tricky - it's hard as a candidate to juggle answering the question and trying to decipher what traits the interviewer is really trying to expose with this question.<p>For example with this one: is the interviewer trying to see if I understand my data structures and the size of this data to the point where I could design such a system from the ground up? Or are they trying to see how practical I can be given real-world time constraints?",1288227669

Very little of that content is still live anywhere but there is a little I think.<p>Also, why do you get to be the arbiter of whether others content can be allowed to disappear or not? If I own the copyright then it's within my rights to have all copies destroyed, for example, you secretly (as you've not notified copyright holders AFAICT) keeping a copy is infringing my moral right to control that work.",1288227662

Unfortunately, I can't use your product because there is no equivalent chrome extension. Is this on the dev roadmap? if it is, make mention of it, as I would definitely bookmark this page and come back.<p>Love the bring a video with you option. Some thoughts on additional features, can you add a compare to other sites besides Amazon? Perhaps newegg.com for electronics. just some more choices would be great.<p>What about send a web page thru gmail? I haven't found a really good extension for this. Something that sends the whole article rather than just a link and keeps the formatting.",1288227638

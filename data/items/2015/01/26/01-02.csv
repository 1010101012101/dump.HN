Only around 4% of the firm’s revenues come from mainframe sales. But once additional hardware, storage, software and all kinds of related services have been factored in, the mainframe accounts for a quarter of IBM’s revenue and nearly half of profits, estimates Toni Sacconaghi of Berstein Research.<p>Read that again. <i>HALF</i> of profits.

The only usage of lisp that I know of is inside Naughty Dog (Last of Us, Uncharted, Jak and Daxter, etc), who have used it internally for a long time. I hear they&#x27;re lisp nuts, but even they don&#x27;t try to write the game engine in it.<p>> Write version 0 in a high level language. Figure out the design and representation. Then rewrite the slow parts in a more efficient language.<p>For something small, retro, or 2D then maybe this could work. For anything else, this would be setting yourself up for failure.<p>You&#x27;ll end up rewriting all or most in C or C++. This will cause you to miss deadlines and generally people will shit on your game on the internet.<p>Maybe it will be fast enough at this point, but odds are it won&#x27;t. It will probably have the same problem as most game engines written in a high-level style, even if they&#x27;re in C or C++. You&#x27;ll fire up a profiler but there won&#x27;t be any optimization targets. The whole program will be more or less equally slow.  This is because you didn&#x27;t design with memory access patterns in mind. 90% of the code will be spent waiting for memory to load during a cache miss.<p>Eventually, the game will be released and will struggle to hit 30fps. People will continue to shit on the game online, and that&#x27;s if anybody bothers to play it.<p>Since you&#x27;re starting now, it will probably be at least 4-5 year in the future, so even if 60fps expected by everybody yet, the oculus rift will be out, and anybody who plays your game on that will have a bad time. On the oculus, the framerate needs to be at least 90fps, or you risk inducing nausea. That means you have 9ms to update, and do <i>two</i> renders of the game (one for each eye), and if you can&#x27;t make this target, your game isn&#x27;t just slow, it&#x27;s actively harmful to the users.<p>The only way to avoid this is to think about memory usage, access, and the cache from the very beginning. At that point, maybe you could still write it in lisp, but any benefit it would have given you is gone.<p>I&#x27;ve seen most of this first hand (on engines that were written in C++, but ignored the cache), and it really sucks.",1422237216

8945120,comment,8944449,8944768,0,0,bdonlan,,,"The Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust is not an exchange, it&#x27;s an Exchange Traded Fund. Basically you can think of it as a shell company that exists solely to possess (approximately) 0.2 BTC per share; buying into it is _approximately_ equivalent to buying BTC (less the trust&#x27;s expenses). It&#x27;s no different in theory from precious-metal ETFs like GLD or PPLT, although I&#x27;d expect expenses to be lower since no precious metals need to actually be stored.<p>The operation of a trust like this is simplified by the fact that the Trust itself never buys bitcoins, and sells bitcoins only as necessary to pay the Trust&#x27;s expenses. The day-to-day arbitrage that causes the price to track that of actual bitcoins is something that third parties do; they can exchange a certain number of bitcoins for a certain number of shares (and vice versa).<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s a lot easier to run a trust like this than an actual exchange; you don&#x27;t need to track lots of tiny transactions, allow every random person on the internet to open accounts, generate 1099-B forms, hold significant US dollar deposits, etc.<p>Heck, it doesn&#x27;t even need a hot wallet; in that prospectus, exchanges of BTC for shares take three business days for settlement, which is more than enough time for a quorum of people to get their keys out of their respective bank safe deposit boxes around the country and sign a multi-signature settlement transaction offline.<p>The big advantage of this trust, though, is that once it is listed on a big stock exchange, you&#x27;ll be able to go to any stock broker and buy an interest in bitcoin. Your accountant will be able to deal with the tax implications easily, since it&#x27;s just a stock, and you&#x27;ll even be able to do margin transactions through properly licensed and insured brokers. It&#x27;ll take a lot of the infrastructure risk out of a bitcoin investment (although volatility risk will of course remain in full force).",1422235929

You can run Windows and Linux on modern mainframes as well, so they&#x27;re handy there as well.

Cisco UCS is more connection-oriented with the emphasis upon making your network topologies far more flexible than with mainframes, so mainframes are compute-oriented versions in that respect with historically weaker support for scaling out with interoperability across the rest of your network infrastructure (not sure if anyone at IBM or CA has seriously taken standards like BGP and OSPF into account for mainframes, that is).

We are material beings, made out of the same material as everything else in the universe and hence subject to the same fundamentals laws.<p>>If I could perfectly predict your actions (with a physics model), most people agree free will is impossible.<p>If that&#x27;s the case, there should not be a problem. Even in a fully deterministic universe we&#x27;ll never be able to run a simulation to predict the actions for anyone anyway. You&#x27;re a product of not only the actions of the trillions of particles that make up you, but also of the countless of particles in the environment over your entire life-span, that of your parents, your grandparents, all the way to the big bang. We&#x27;ll never be able to simulate the trillions of particles that make up any specific body, much less that body&#x27;s environment using fundamental equations. So if predictability of particles is how you measure free will, then we have free will.<p>Things get muddled a little because we may be able to get a &#x27;good enough&#x27; prediction of someone&#x27;s behaviour just by analyzing his/her neurons with a fMRI or something. This is akin to the difference between knowing tomorrow&#x27;s weather EXACTLY by simulating every particle of the atmosphere vs. knowing the weather tomorrow to some degree of confidence by analyzing higher-order patterns like air pressure, cloud coverage, temperature etc.<p>So your definition is too weak. Most people would say we don&#x27;t have free will if we live in a universe with deterministic laws. Whether anyone can actually use those laws to predict your actions is not that relevant.<p>>It doesn&#x27;t mean free will exists, of course. It&#x27;s just less improbable?<p>Not really. Think about, let&#x27;s say every decision you made was determined by a (quantum, full random, totally unpredictable) coin toss. That doesn&#x27;t get you one step closer towards a libertarian-type of free will. Sure your actions are, in principle, much less, predictable to those around you, but that&#x27;s not the yard-stick we use to measure free will by anyway. Your actions are already unpredictable in a deterministic universe anyway. You merely traded being a slave to deterministic laws of physics to being a slave of random coin toss.<p>Second, it&#x27;s an open question how much quantum randomness actually affects your day-to-day actions. Quantum effects are only pronounced on very small scales. At the scale of groups of atoms, molecules and cells, Newtonian physics, chemistry, and biology, and neurology can be substituted without loss of precision.",1422235471

If you think &quot;only runs in a VM&quot; and &quot;toy&quot; are synonyms, you need a history lesson.<p>Back in the 1960s, one of the hot new things from IBM (you know, the company that wins on Jeopardy) was VM/CMS. VM is a VM, hence the imaginative name, and CMS stood for Conversational Monitor System, originally Cambridge Monitor System, for reasons I&#x27;ll let you figure out.<p>Conversational meant &quot;has a command line&quot;, as opposed to batch, which you might have heard of. CMS was, all told, somewhere between pond scum and MS-DOS on the complexity scale: it provided some APIs for applications, but didn&#x27;t handle memory protection, multitasking, multiple users, or security policy. A mainframe running CMS on the bare metal would have been a really expensive version of a PC from twenty or so years later; obviously, you can only justify doing that in a Serious University.<p>However, it was convenient and user-friendly back before the term was coined, when that meant &quot;not seeing raw machine code unless you asked for it&quot;, so the gag was to run multiple instances of CMS as guests under VM, which provided everything CMS didn&#x27;t. Every user got their own copy of the OS, and the single physical mainframe was turned into dozens or hundreds of virtual mainframes by VM.<p>My punchline: As the decades wore on, CMS was never modified to take newer hardware into account. Why would it be? It never ran on the bare metal. VM gained emulation functionality, CMS grew to depend on that, and now CMS is effectively an appendage of VM, a friendly face to the thing which does all the hard work.

I have a garage, and I&#x27;m not hurting for living space so no need to convert it (which would also raise my property taxes). \nNo labor cost to handle all the micro transfers of responsibility/possession. No complex tracking, routing, and billing system required, no embarrassing privacy and security failures even with large investments and ongoing costs in that area. You don&#x27;t think a family of 2 or 3 or 4 drives 15k miles a year in America? Maybe the number of cars drops from one per person to one per every other adult in a household. Maybe retirees pool their cars with their friends or share them with their working children. Looking at all the cars on the road with one person in them, I&#x27;d say we&#x27;re pretty far from 1 car per household, let alone 0.<p>Parking cost when I&#x27;m away go down because the car can park itself somewhere cheaper (in automated facilities), or drive itself home, be at the disposal of friends/family, drop off or pick up things for me. Since in your world their are fewer cars, that puts downward pressure on parking prices. Parking facilities can be located in more economical areas, and pack cars more efficiently because they are automated and instrumented, and their own labor costs are reduced.<p>One of the main practical use cases for local cabs/ubers is a ride to the airport. Since my car can drive itself home, I really have no need for a ride for hire. Also, since giving a friend a friend a ride to the airport no longer a personal time investment, the odds of getting a ride from a friend increase. If you&#x27;re worried about me not maximizing my 44 cents per mile, I can take someone leaving the airport home, assuming they meet my standards of reputation. At this point you&#x27;re probably crowing victory, but note that is purely a highly infrequent, discretionary use of my excess capacity, perhaps less than 1% of miles driven for most people. It&#x27;s more tax efficient to just swap (robo) rides with friends.<p>A self driving car will reduce all these onerous costs that ridesharing is supposed to save me from, plus I can earn money from it in your Renters Paradise, so I don&#x27;t see any downside in owning a car. I hardly feel the cost as it is, even without driving anything close to the most economical, lowest TCO car on the market.",1422234764

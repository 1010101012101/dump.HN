If I had my priorities straight I would have understood years ago that ""it is better to have tried and failed than not tried at all"".
Better late than never:)""",1211028002

192594,comment,191907,192546,0,0,rbanffy,,,"Compsci is closer to Math than to Engineering. While you can study nature to find useful algorithms and approaches to solving real world problems, the fact something is not useful or solves no real problem never stopped mathematicians from exploring the idea. The very distinction of real problems from less real ones is totally strange to mathematicians. ;-)<p>It usually works out that the useless math of one day becomes very useful some later day, usually in an incredibly unexpected way. It is also usual that physicist tend to discover a use well before any engineers start poking around it.<p>As for observing nature, it's also frequent that engineers find ways to control and use something well before physicists have any clue as to how and why it works.",1211027703

It seems to have inherited the Lisp culture - it is not kind to noobs.<p>In contrast, I found installing Ubuntu to be hard as well, as several pieces of my hardware were not well-supported. I asked many questions, some of them quite basic, and always received prompt, patient help.",1211026840

In REALLY hot weather, frequently take very short showers with your clothes on.<p>Luckily the place I'm living at has a basement, which stays cool even in summer, so those methods aren't necessary.",1211026595

All the ""advanced"" ones, I mean: Google, Microsoft, Yahoo. Do you have any idea how expensive satellite photos are? When you roll out 10 terabytes over a weekend? This business isn't sustainable on its own.<p>What I'm saying, maybe we Google-Map-alikes shouldn't be so smug - we're plagued by the same monetization troubles as Facebook et al. It's all a swindle too. So should I change my occupation? Or make it profitable somehow? Throw in your thoughts!",1211026381

192586,comment,191899,191916,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I concur on the beta tester conversion path.  It's a twist on the freemium model without the negative that people expect some level of your product to always be free.  Whenever you're ready to stop giving away from service, you announce the end of the beta.  The freeloaders leave without a fuss, the real users pony up without complaint...because you were always up front that it wasn't always going to be free.",1211025815

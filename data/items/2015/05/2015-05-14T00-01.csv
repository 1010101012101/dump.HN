9542926,comment,9542480,9542480,0,0,benbreen,,,"My friend Felipe is currently finishing up a PhD dissertation that features this guy (the overarching topic is the impact of aviation technology on modern Brazil). Here&#x27;s an article he wrote specifically about Santos-Dumont:<p><a href=""http://theappendix.net/issues/2014/4/the-aviators-heart"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theappendix.net/issues/2014/4/the-aviators-heart</a><p>Edit: it&#x27;s a long article so here are a few highlights:<p>&quot;His countenance appeared on cigar boxes and dinner plates. Toy replicas of his airships moved off the shelves at a brisk pace. Even bakers joined in, selling airship-shaped cakes with the colors of the Brazilian flag. Fashionable boutiques sold clothing and accessories inspired by his meticulous and impeccable style. Louis Cartier, a friend of his, even made a special wristwatch to use during flight, so he would not have to pull out his pocket watch while handling the controls. In fact, Santos-Dumont was responsible for making the wristwatch a fashionable accessory among men...<p>His showmanship and desire to share the feeling of flight led him to be part of many “firsts” in aviation history. In 1903, Aida de Acosta, a wealthy Cuban-American woman of nineteen years was visiting Paris, where she met Santos-Dumont. Fascinated with flying machines, she expressed her desire to pilot the airship herself. Surprisingly, he agreed—and after a few lessons, allowed her to fly it around Paris while he followed her on a bicycle shouting instructions from below (airship no. 9 only had a 3 horsepower engine and could barely conquer a light breeze). This made Acosta the first woman in history to fly a powered aircraft of any sort, some six months before the Wright Brothers first took flight in the United States.&quot;",1431565191

A sandbox just moderates that communication.<p>I also don&#x27;t understand &quot;If the project is sufficiently secure without multi-process, adding layers only increases the surface area&quot;. The point of layers is that each one needs to be breached in order to craft a full exploit. If one layer is sufficiently secure without multi-process then in the worst case your defense-in-depth is merely redundant, regardless of the attack surface of the remaining layers (though obviously &quot;sufficiently secure&quot; is fairly impossible to prove).",1431565172

9542904,comment,9542480,9542480,0,0,205guy,,,"I looked at the Wikipedia article for the Wright flyer in 1903, to contrast and compare:<p><a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_Flyer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_Flyer</a><p>What&#x27;s interesting is that the Wright brothers couldn&#x27;t reproduce the flight:<p>&quot;The landing broke the front elevator supports, which the Wrights hoped to repair for a possible four-mile (6 km) flight to Kitty Hawk village. Soon after, a heavy gust picked up the Flyer and tumbled it end over end, damaging it beyond any hope of quick repair. It was never flown again. [...]After a single statement to the press in January 1904 and a failed public demonstration in May, the Wright Brothers did not publicize their efforts, and other aviators who were working on the problem of flight (notably Alberto Santos-Dumont) were thought by the press to have preceded them by many years.&quot;<p>They did however develop the Flyer II in 1904, and their Flyer III in 1905 flew a &quot;39-minute, 24-mile (39 km) nonstop circling flight on October 5.&quot; Arguably, controlled directional flight is a much more important feature.<p>But most interesting is this part of the story:<p>&quot;The issue of control was correctly seen as critical by the Wrights, and they acquired a wide American patent intended to give them ownership of basic aerodynamic control, despite the brothers&#x27; (and others in pioneer aviation circles) likely complete lack of knowledge of the 1868 British patent regarding roll control for aircraft. This was fought in both American and European courts. European designers, however, were little affected by the litigation and continued their own development. The legal fight in the U.S., however, had a crushing effect on the nascent American aircraft industry, and by the time of World War I, the U.S. had no suitable military aircraft and had to purchase French and British models.&quot;",1431564651
9542903,comment,9541581,9542814,0,0,gregpilling,,,"I asked a friend who is a preschool teacher (and became friends when my kid was in her class for 2 years, 4-5 year olds) if she thought that all children were creative (regardless of talent), or if she thought that only some kids were creative and other kids were not really - just doing what they were told. Her answer was unequivocal - &quot;all kids are creative. Not all are talented, but they all create&quot;<p>I love sci-fi, and I was asking her the question because the future utopian dream is that the 3-D Printing cornucopia machines deliver to humanity all they want, and the only task left to do is to create. So to me it seems settled. All people are creative as children and somehow that goes away as they become adults. I suspect people just adapt to the best way for them to get by, creative or drudgery, whatever it takes. The modern school system can probably take some credit, as well as human&#x27;s normal tendency to adapt to whatever the herd is doing - ie if all your adult friends stop playing with LEGO maybe you would too. (I did not stop playing with LEGO)<p>So I hope all humans are once more makers, and we can stop with silly labels.

A bit of tweaking to the source later, and I have something readable. Now, about the actual article:<p>Also:<p>Can someone explain to me why it has to assume that arr.length could change? It states it does, but I don&#x27;t see why. That seems like a pretty obvious optimization flaw: you should be able to safely assume that something won&#x27;t change if the only cases where it could change is if it already has changed. In other words, why is this:<p><pre><code>    var sum = 0;
    for (var i = 0, L = arr.length;
         i < arr.length;
         ++i) {

        H.throwConcurrentModificationError(arr);
      var item = list[i];

not optimizable to remove the whole business with L and the if check?<p>Also, this is one of my frustrations with optimizers in general. Far too many of them end up with global (or at the very least) side-effects of trivial changes (or worse, changes that shouldn&#x27;t do anything!), to the point of making optimization a fool&#x27;s game.

9542866,comment,9541134,9541134,0,0,dasil003,,,"I see a lot of wisdom in this article and I find myself nodding, but I&#x27;m dubious whether it&#x27;s effectively communicated from the article per se or its just my experience dovetailing with the author&#x27;s.  The problem is that &quot;technical debt&quot; is an analogy, and like all analogies, it breaks down.  It&#x27;s never a choice between writing perfect code or hacking together the fastest ugliest thing that could possibly work, rather all long-term software development is a continuous series of tradeoffs heavily dependent on an unknowable future.<p>Consider the center-point of this article:<p>> <i>I view technical debt as any code that decreases agility as the project matures.</i><p>Well, any given piece of code can have positive or negative value based on what change you need to make in the future.  You can have a perfectly factored, elegant piece of code which becomes useless if the job to be done changes, at which point you are better with <i>no</i> code than the previously ideal code.  On the other hand, you can have a module which is ugly as sin, unreadable, and horrible in every way, but it does a job that never needs changing, and it&#x27;s isolated enough that no one ever even has to look at it or consider it.<p>So the very judgement of the scope and severity of technical debt depends non-trivially on the future.  Individually design decisions can be critiqued, and the likelihood of certain types of changes can be weighed out, and certainly the best engineering and product teams are very very good at this, but the fact is that the whole endeavor is terribly fraught and difficult to concretize.<p>All that said, I think the author is absolutely right that engineers often have a proclivity to polish some bit of code or architecture when their time would be better spent elsewhere, but it&#x27;s just a tiny microcosm of the problem facing all startups: you need to build a money-making machine, and you have infinitely many dials to turn, with only a handful of (hopefully) smart people on a very limited runway.  How do you make decisions day-to-day about where your greatest marginal utility lies?  I don&#x27;t think there are any rules of thumb that are globally applicable.

If the project is sufficiently secure without multi-process, adding layers only increases the surface area for attack vectors. Sandboxing not only increases the surface area of your (now) multiple processes, but also introduces the OS layer as an arbiter of communication between them, which we can safely assume does not have memory safety guarantees (though is probably quite hardened).<p>Of course, the developers would not claim that Servo is &quot;sufficiently secure&quot; right now, especially since (as brson mentioned) it still includes C & C++ source. My point is, sandboxing can be a huge win in terms of security, especially for now; but any complex feature has tradeoffs and the efficacy of those tradeoffs may not continue to hold through the future and should remain open to consideration.",1431562546

It&#x27;s built on Neo4j&#x27;s graph database engine, with .NET MVC, KnockoutJS, Backbone, etc. I&#x27;ve built the administrative back-end & a front end where people can browse art, artists, collections, & timelines. At this point I have to go back to full-time work as I know nothing about fund raising but want to continue developing the site as a resource. As far as I know there&#x27;s nothing like it for art & history out there.<p>It can:<p>[1] Visualise where specific works of art (and all works by an artist or style) are on a map<p>[2] Capture relationships between artists & people<p>[3] Break a person&#x27;s life down into events & plot them in time & space. E.g., you can see a slideshow of Da Vinci&#x27;s life, where he lived & what he did.<p>[4] Suggest similar artworks based on rich attributes<p>I&#x27;ve built a prototype & hosted it on Amazon.

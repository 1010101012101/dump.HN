You can just as easily call `git update-server-info` and copy the .git from your repo into a web-accessible directory, and just be done with it, the same as Darcs.<p>The reason people do it other ways (either via git-daemon, gitosis or ssh) is because Git uses a special transport protocol that's <i>far</i> more efficient than a dumb HTTP session.  It's not that Git <i>won't</i> work over a dumb HTTP session, it'll just be a lot <i>faster</i> using it's own server/protocol.",1223556745

327745,comment,327475,327732,0,0,nuclear_eclipse,,,"In all seriousness, the only reason I use Python over Lua is for the library.  Lua is far more flexible and extensible, but it has a very sore lack of standard libraries like you can find with Python.  But I keep my fingers crossed, and continue to use Lua as an interpreter inside my C apps, where the lack of libraries is a non-issue because everything I need to use is a custom API exported from C.",1223556309

Stock value is very relevant, though I personally hate the way we go about depending on it as a performance metric, which I think is how you're looking at it.<p>Stocks are reflective of performance, rarely (if not) the other way around.  Doesn't mean it never happens that way, although.",1223555660
327736,comment,327096,327252,0,0,dhuck,,,"I love biking: I ride a fixed gear to school almost every day, it's only a few miles and I can get to class faster if you include the time it takes to park and walk to class.<p>The health benefits for riding a bicycle are a fantastic reason to start and continue doing it.<p>But one thing I would just like to point out to everyone - you are going to pay for fuel, either way. You might not be paying for oil when you bike, but you definitely need to pay for food. If you are trying to lose weight and reduce your calories, I guess you can afford to eat less, but eventually you'll need to eat a lot (really, it's a noticeable increase) of food to make up for your exercising. And that costs money - so I really wonder about the savings gained from biking.<p>This shouldn't detract anyone from riding a bike, I'm just sayin'.",1223555490

327732,comment,327475,327475,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"I tried Python out right when I was getting incredibly frustrated with a Perl program that had grown too large for its own good. Python seemed so much cleaner that I switched <i>immediately</i>. Its standard library is quite nice, though not quite as large as CPAN.<p>Ironically, I may be switching from Python to Lua now, for the same reason.",1223554645
327731,comment,327475,327554,0,0,mdasen,,,"I'd argue that Python goes beyond legibility of code since most of the Python community seems to have settled on very similar coding standards.  Not just silly things like 4-space indents, but the way the code is written.  It makes it really easy to pick up foreign Python code.<p>The explicit over implicit here also helps.  Yes, it is a pain when dealing with only your code (why do I have to keep doing self.var_name when Java just lets me say var_name), but when dealing with foreign code, it means you have explicit scope.<p>I'd also argue that Python's import is just wonderful.  Where many languages like their secret-sauce methods, Python's explicit imports makes it incredibly simple to find where a name is coming from.  While Java has the convention of import java.util.*, Python has the convention of from math import log - which imports the name log into your file.  So, you see log used in the file, you can easily look at the import to see where it's coming from - and yes, it isn't hard to imagine identical names in different libraries and you shouldn't need to know that something with the same name is defined in two places that usually aren't used together.  Want the whole math library, just import math and then use math.func() so that you still know where everything is coming from!<p>For what it's worth, I think Python's syntax is a bit ugly, but it's standard!  Python code never looks that foreign and having foreign code look familiar to you is just wonderful.  It might not matter when you have your 1-person project, but when dealing with the code of other's, it's wonderful.",1223554492

If you look at the strengths, assets, and liabilities of a company, conclude it's a good purchase, and buy in, you should be happy unless some of those factors change.  The stock becoming an even better buy doesn't change your good buy.",1223554405

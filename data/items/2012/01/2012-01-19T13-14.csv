Leap years can be calculated in advance as they represent a well-known, fixed skew between the gregorian calendar and the actual calendar.<p>Contrast this with leap seconds, which represent a variable skew and cannot be predicted by algorithm. Leap seconds are determined by measurement of the solar cycle and are merely announced at 6 month intervals. Because of this we cannot use solar time with seconds-granularity more than 6 months into the future, and a table of past leap-seconds is needed to accurately calculate time in the past.

I agree that cat.jpg was a privacy violation and I do believe they did more than simply look at the filename. However, I'll take the unpopular position that this is within the limits of what one can reasonably expect from a website providing a service as 37signals does. Admins will, and are completely expected to, look at the data - if only to make sure everything is working. Looking at a file called cat.jpg because it's the gazillionth file is pushing the boundary a bit, but I still think this is OK. The moment I opt to use a hosted project management software, I implicitly accept that things like this (and potentially much worse) might happen.<p>Forgive me cperciva, but to me your post looks just like a giant plug for your own service. Client-side encryption is not warranted for everything, nor is it a reasonable goal for every app that shares data on the web. It's fine that Tarsnap does this, and frankly I would expect the same from a service like, say, DropBox - but it's not a reasonable expectation when it comes to the type of apps 37signals provides.",1326981023

Like most things, change requires time to cultivate and raising awareness is just as important as taking active action. There is after all strength in numbers. One person vehemently protesting is not better than thousands of slacktivists.<p>It more or less comes down to a numbers game. Not everyone will proactively go out of their way to take action (or will only do the very minimum, like changing their profile picture). To expect everyone to be proactive is unrealistic. The advantage that awareness gives is that it reaches out to the masses potentially hitting those who have the aptitude and attitude to take firm action.

The biggest difference of all had  little to do with money, technology, or superficial lifestyle; it had to do with <i>state of mind</i>. Like all young generations, we were confused and didn't understand why things were the way they were. So, with lots of energy and spare time, we took action...<p>We protested, we marched, we did whatever we thought it took to affect change. We took the side of the oppressed: blacks, women, gays, the poor and homeless, the environment, and most of all, we protested an illegal and immoral war. We ended the war and we changed the world.<p>It's great to see that some things haven't changed: young people still find a way to channel their resources to try to make things better, but here's the problem: All I see with this worldwide Occupy movement is people complaining, ""Where's mine?"" It seems like it's all about ""me"", not ""us"".<p>That's why these SOPA protests are so refreshing to me. It's the first thing I've noticed in years that reminds me of my youth, not so much in action, but in spirit. People have taken a few minutes to stop worrying about themselves to do something about the greater good for all of us.<p>But the spirit of modern times prevents us from doing enough. We will take action so long as it doesn't cost us too much. Where is the sacrifice? Where is the ""put your money where your mouth is""? I love the way OP points this out.<p>I'm proud of Wikipedia. Craigslist came close, forcing its users to work to get to their local pages. But too many, like Google, just wimped out. All their black banner said was, ""We care, but not that much.""<p>Listen to OP! For just a few minutes, fuck the ""stake holders"", the ""money managers"", the ""players"", the ""metrics"", the ""ROI"", and the ""bottom line"". Can't we just once pretend that it's 1968, and stop giving a shit about ourselves long enough to realize that a couple of extra bucks today will soon be worthless in a world going to shit if we don't do something about it? Only when we demonstrate the passion that comes from true sacrifice will the ""normals"" really take notice.<p></BabyBoomerRant, TimeForMaalox>",1326979827

I must admit that it feels like an odd definition to me indeed. I see how ""the first n natural numbers"" is a finite set of n elements, but I don't see how the reverse is true. I mean, look here, a finite set of n elements: {1, 1, 1, 1}. 4 elements, and they're all valued 1. They're also not ordered. So your concept of taking an element from a finite set (in this case, let's say, 1, or maybe 1 instead) to uniquely identify an element in a vector sounds a bit odd to me :-)<p>Clearly, I'm the noob here, and maybe in this stage Idris just isn't meant for people not on Lambda the Ultimate, but if not, it's good that you intend do something about it :-)<p>Cause once again, I love the concept, and I'd love to program with this.",1326978960

It means you end up procrastinating when you should be working, and feeling guilty when you should be having time off.<p>I'm speculating based on the above two quotes, but are you experiencing something similar? I can imagine it would be hard to have any guilt-free play at all with the spectre of unpaid bills over your head.<p>Still, I humbly suggest that you schedule at least one day off (and plan it, like, 13:00 - 15:00 - play playstation, 15:00 - 17:00 - walk in the park etc, so your mind doesn't naturally wander to work or mire itself in guilt). This won't make you feel any less depressed, but might give you the emotional resources to rambo through any tasks you've been avoiding.<p>P.S.

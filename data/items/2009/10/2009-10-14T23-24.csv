When you exercise you damage your body, keeping your repair mechanisms active.<p>However overexercise typically does more damage in a session than your body can heal before your next session. It's rather safe to assume that when you contract a virus that when the immunological warfare is going on (our bodies first response is rather brutal and untargeted, the sore throat from a flu isn't from the flu, it's from your own immune cells killing - IIRC - roughly 20 healthy throat cells for 1 infected cell) and damaging our body that the repair mechanisms are coping with all too much.<p>Not exercising doesn't put stress on our healing mechanisms, however it doesn't keep them active and trained (so to speak). Put it this way, the Police would take considerably longer to get to your house from the station than from one of their patrol routes; essentially the same is for our healing mechanism.<p>Even if exercise doesn't have an effect on our immune system, I'm sure it will certainly increase recovery time (assuming you're not on the treadmill when sick) by decreasing healing time, which is ostensibly the factor that kills you and not the virus itself (assuming you haven't contracted the 1918 Spanish flu).<p>I've only ever had one noticeable case of the flu (which happened when I moved country, so I'm unsure if it was a strain I'd never experience, similar to the current H1N1 'pandemic'), which I believe is due to frequent exercise (a job involving heavy lifting ~90lbs and constant weight carrying ~10 lb tool pouch and ~10lb hammer drill).",1255564071

The fact that something has had ""$10,000 of their own money and countless months"" invested in it does not mean that the end product is valuable. You appear to be subscribing to the labour theory of value here; it's like something out of Marx.<p>My point is that I can choose to do multiple things with my next unit of time. I get to choose how I spend my time and money. By analysing my preferences, I can figure out how I value different ways of spending my time. And the fact is I only chose to spend about 6 hours playing something that cost me $20, while I spent perhaps $90 for over 1000 hours playing Far Cry / 2. If you work it out, you'll see $2 is actually pretty generous, as it includes the aspects of the WoG playing experience that can't be directly substituted by the FPSes, such as novelty and newsworthiness. Nevertheless, I regretted spending $20 on WoG. Not hugely, but I regretted it.<p>Accuse me of tastelessness all you like. Perhaps taste, like value, is in the eye of the beholder.<p>(Of course, when you factor in the cost of hardware and the like, the cost for me for various FPSes is actually pretty substantial; but these are sunk costs, and almost all of the resources save the graphics card are used in my day job anyhow.)",1255562541

For these reasons, they are more like a movie, and don't have particularly good replay value (IMHO).<p>Far Cry, on the other hand, was a masterpiece of playability, leaps and bounds ahead of any Half Life game, again IMHO. The freedom to tackle each situation resulted in large rewards to creativity.<p>Far Cry 2 took it even further; rather than just having to tactically plan one's approach to action bubbles, one needed to plan an entire navigation across the map, avoiding guard posts, road patrols, etc. I've never played a more immersive game than Far Cry 2, a game that took me to another world, save perhaps Outcast or Thief.",1255561720

Three are three major problems:<p>1. Bandwidth.  Many parallel algorithms require more bandwidth than the available pool of idle home computers can provide.<p>2. Latency.  Many parallel algorithms require low latency -- say, under 1 ms -- and the speed of light thus prohibits any worldwide computing efforts.  In some cases, this can be attacked by replacing algorithms (e.g., LU factorization by block QR factorization) or by using a small well-connected set of nodes to perform latency-sensitive work while most nodes do less latency-sensitive work.<p>3. Byzantine failures.  Home PCs have a very high failure rate -- not only where permanent and transient failures are concerned, but also where returning bogus results is concerned.  The best estimates I've seen indicate that bit error rates on home PCs are at least two orders of magnitude higher than those on supercomputing clusters.<p>I was cold-called by two VCs back in 2000, after I announced the computation of the quadrillionth bit of Pi; at that point distributed computing was a hot topic and over $50M had been thrown at companies in the area in the previous 10 years.  I told them that they didn't understand the field, that they were fools for investing in it, and that the research belonged at universities for the present time... and history proved me right.",1255561265

863015,comment,862859,862984,0,0,kgrin,,,"The ""unfortunate"" comment seemed to be directed at the <i>relative inequality</i>, not the fact that whites are ""succeeding"".  I think it's pretty tough to make the case that economic and educational inequality in the United States <i>along racial lines</i> is intrinsically a good thing, particularly given the historical context.<p>Inequality may be the least-bad outcome given the menu of potential remedies (""Harrison Bergeron"" and all that), but it's not a great thing in and of itself.  Particularly given the historical and occasional modern-day evidence of straight-up racism (see: <a href=""http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DXK/is_9_20/ai_104521293/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DXK/is_9_20/ai_10452...</a> ), I think it's reasonable to at least scrutinize situations of high inequality to figure out whether they are, in fact, just caused by some people working harder or being more lucky or what have you, or whether there are actual problems.<p>On the merits, though, I think OKCupid's matching algorithm (the questions) theoretically accounts for the social, economic and cultural differences - what their data shows (""suggests"" is probably more appropriate) is that people react to race <i>even after controlling for the other factors</i>, which is at least interesting.<p>Edit: just to clarify and follow up - here's my claim: if the relative dominance of Ashkenazi Jews among American scientists, or Vietnamese women among nail-salon entrepreneurs, were the result of, say, discrimination, or government subsidies at others' expense, or some sort of other external factor that made the ""competition"" unfair, then it would be fair to categorize that inequality as ""unfortunate"".  As far as I'm aware, that's not the case for either of those examples (and in fact is somewhat the opposite).  But if it were (and the author of the original comment we're talking about seems to make that assumption about whites being better off on many socioeconomic measures), then calling that inequality ""unfortunate"" wouldn't be out of line.",1254783047

These private equity players, through investment banking and other financial intermediaries are able to borrow close to the low Fed-orchestrated rate, while the companies they buy could not access the same cheap money, without which there is no basis for these deals. It was the ""Age of the Financier"" and every such age ended in mass misery. There is a reason all major religions prohibit usury, and in most traditional societies, making money on money is viewed with discomfort. After all, as the biblical story has it, Jesus chased the money changers from the temple.<p>The past 25+ years have been a mass redistribution of wealth  towards the financial class, discouraging real capital accumulation in favor of playing games with money.

And certainly, no one should be on the hook for $11,000 for saying they like their local pizzeria because they once had a coupon for a free pizza.

5803084,comment,5799769,5800033,1,0,recovering_qa,,,"> The difference between a really great QA tester and an okay QA tester is probably less than 2x.<p>I did QA for about 5 years at a Fortune 100; my admittedly anecdotal experience was that top performers wrote more Priority 1 issues that resulted in more fixes than many people combined. It depended on the team and the project, but for me it was closer to 6x.<p>Beyond find & fix rates, there is the general quality of a bug, good QA understand the system well enough to quickly & correctly isolate where a problem occurs even without looking at any code. This can result in a ton of saved time for developers.<p>Regression testing is a small part of QA, just because you have a focus area for a particular day doesn't shut down your capability to find bugs in issues unrelated to say, regressions.<p>And for a final tidbit, regression testing (going through bug reports that have already been fixed, ensuring they are still fixed) probably has the lowest find rate out of almost any type of other testing in my experience (in terms of the original issue being 're-broken'), and it should be done by software, not people.",1370069906

And later it was a former general who set up the multi-party system (and didn't get elected).<p>I know it sounds off, but what the Founding Fathers did for the US, the generals did for Turkey.

I cannot believe we are collectively so dumb as to require the waste so many hours, so many billions of dollars, and so many lives on this ridiculous security theater. We pay morons in blue outfits to actively make our trips less convenient and our lives less safe. The cost is staggering. So many politicians claim they want to ""repair our crumbling infrastructure"", presumably so we can get where we're going faster and more safely, yet this option is constantly overlooked: abolish the TSA. Leave security up to the airlines and passengers.

Those who are appalled at the lack of respect here need to understand that there are a lot of people within the tech world that have developed very complicated feelings about RMS over the course of the past 20-30 years.<p>I mean, sure, a lot of people who don't know a whole lot about him or haven't had to deal with him over the course of decades might have shallow knee-jerk opinions on him: they hate him, they love him, or they barely know who he is. But I suspect a lot of the anti-RMS sentiment that you might see on someplace like HN comes from a much deeper place than that.<p>I don't hate the guy, personally, and I do think that the good he's done has outweighed the bad. I also agree with him on quite a few fronts, to a degree. However, he has alienated a LOT of people over the years for no good reason other than his own personality issues and a seeming complete lack of a reflective nature or an innate sense of perspective or empathy.<p>I feel sorry for him more than anything else, because I think he's a deeply troubled guy who unfortunately ended up in a life path that sort of rewarded him for staying in his deeply troubled state. He's always had lots of admirers and supporters, not to mention grants and speaking gigs. As a result, he never had any external forces that might compel him to grow up beyond a certain point, intellectually or emotionally.<p>I think a lot of the more nuanced, deep, and well-fermented RMS hate you might see stems not so much from total disagreement, but rather disappointment from wasted potential.  He's somebody who's had a lot of great ideas from which so many great things have sprouted, but he's a terrible steward for those ideas. He ends up making it about him somehow, or takes so many things to such ridiculous extremes, or justifies his ideas for all the wrong reasons, or intentionally alienates the people that he should be trying to build bridges to, that he ends up discrediting the kernels of brilliant truth that are at the heart of much of his philosophy.<p>So, there are a ton of people who at one time or another were inspired by RMS in their larval stages to value freedom and sharing and openness, but grew to see him as an impediment to those very ideals. I'm one of those people and I so wish that it didn't have to be this way. I don't think you're seeing people criticizing his views on ties, so much as you're seeing disillusionment at a much deeper level with RMS' personal and intellectual failings, which are pretty broadly on display even when he's writing about trivial things like ties or hobbies or cell phones.",1370069004

You're saving space and bandwidth while increasing the speed of your page loading by using the css logos.

You can scale these up or down to nearly any size without needing to use or reupload a new image. And the size of the code pretty much stays the same.<p>- If you use a large version of your logo in the header and a small version in the footer you don't need to have 2 seperate images.

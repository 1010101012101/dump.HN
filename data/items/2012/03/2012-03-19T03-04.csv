3722215,comment,3721927,3721927,2,0,BlackJack,,,"I think you guys are focusing too much on the ""how is this about women"" aspect and not the message. I agree that the bulk of her argument does not depend on her being a women. Let's move on.<p>Isn't it true that there's a lack of intellectual diversity? Most good programmers read about technology, code, and do technical things, but do they have worldly wisdom? To quote Charlie Munger:<p>You must know the big ideas in the big disciplines, and use them routinely  all of them, not just a few. Most people are trained in one model  economics, for example  and try to solve all problems in one way. You know the old saying: to the man with a hammer, the world looks like a nail. This is a dumb way of handling problems.<p>I think by only focusing on one thing, a lot of programmers miss out on being better. This theme recurs everywhere. Feynman used to talk about using a ""different box of tools"" which enabled him to solve many problems. He would also keep many problems in his head and whenever he learned a new trick, he would apply that trick to all his problems. Every now and then he'd solve a big problem and people would say he's a genius!<p>Gian-Carlo Rota, the MIT mathematician, once wrote that Erdos and Hilbert (prolific mathematicians) had many interesting results, but it seemed they used the same tricks over and over everywhere - they just had different strategies.<p>It's impossible to develop new mental models or add to your toolbox when you're learning what everyone else is learning. But if you explore beyond your boundaries, then you'll pick up new things which will not only make your life richer but also help you in your endeavors.",1332129586

3722213,comment,3721927,3721927,11,0,marquis,,,"As another woman in tech I read this hesitantly and find I don't agree with the argument she is making here. While my workplace is also dominated with men I have learnt to manage communication differences and stand on the merit of my work. Yes, I consistently get belittled in small ways, mostly by older clients, but if this is what I have to deal with it's a small thing and easily brushed off - and I know it will disappear in time as our demographic loses those who are not used to non-stereotypical people in their environment. But I want to state that I'm a little older than her, and certainly in my 20s I would rail against the hegemony at any chance I got. I made noise and I'm glad I did - in all the arguments and frustration I was able to figure out who I am and where I want to be. She needs to consider herself a pioneer and revel in that - to celebrate her difference and what she can accomplish, and in that different perspective what she brings to her field. If there are those that resist around her, she has a choice to push back harder or move to another environment.<p>I'd like to comment on her point that her co-workers are myopic in their interests: this is irrelevant to her argument as she could just as easily be a male whose interests lie outside of the status quo. I have seen many different kinds of people work together, and in the right environment acceptance is key. She may find that switching jobs give her a totally new outlook. Let me provide a short example: I am not a gamer and have really no interest. But I am fascinated by the mechanics and functionality of how a massive game such as WoW is created. So if a conversation turns to a gaming topic, I know that I have an opportunity to learn something (how does Blizzard scale, what is their stack/languages etc). There is no topic that cannot be made interesting.<p>This comment here depressed me however: ""Yawn. Then quit, whatever. Stop bitching about it. The only thing I ever hear about from ""women in tech"" is complaining, and it's boring.""<p>This is completely unfair and unhelpful. She has a complaint, and it is important for her to feel she can express this without fear of personal attack. Comments like this is the reason things don't change, because we fear being called out as 'emotional' or 'unreasonable'. A younger, or less confident person, will take comments like these personally and wonder if their concerns are valid. She has every right to enter the debate on her own terms and we should approach her concerns reasonably and fairly. Losing any brilliant mind because of suppressed expression would be a tragedy.",1332129511
3722212,comment,3721927,3721927,5,0,defrost,,,"Wow.<p>This reads like a good reason to advise people with wide interests not to go into the IT field as there's a good chance they'll end up in a bubble where all they talk about is IT.<p>There's nothing in here that specifically applies to women, nor applies to the wider field of Engineering.<p>For goodness sake woman if you're trapped in an IT ghetto then get the f*k out.<p>I've got women friends that went the trade route and became certified electricians later transferring to programming after running their own businesses - they're loving IT after male dominated site work. Another acquaintance has a background in pure / applied mathematics, she founded an Engineering/Math/Comp. Sci. faculty, hard work but no complaints.<p>My cousin has been in Civil Engineering for two decades and she's practically running a large transnational now, loves her job.<p>A scary reason that might reasonably justify telling young girls not to go into geology is that they might end up on a remote mine site as the sole female and getting continuously sexually harassed and eyed up as a potential rape victim. That's a very real issue.<p>Hanging out with a bunch of geeks that talk about nothing but their D12's and their Rails code is certainly not for everyone, I agree, but please don't use that as a reason to advise women to avoid Engineering.",1332129500

3722178,comment,3721501,3721921,3,0,femto,,,"The last paragraph suggests a new organisation for a company: one where people can job share high value jobs, in return for an average salary.<p>Here's an example.  Let's say I am capable of earning $160,000 a year, if I work 5 days a week in a role that is optimally suited to my skills.  The problem is that this role leaves me with little time for my family (or other projects) and an excess of money.  What I really want is to work 2 days a week for a salary of $64,000.<p>The above is hard to do in the current employment system.  The closest options seem to be:<p>1) Take part time work.  Typically part time work pays a much lower hourly rate, so to get my $64,000, I'm having to work 5 days/week.  No gain, only pain.<p>2) Go into contracting.  Fine for a single person, but too unstable with dependents.<p>3) Work for some number of years, then quit for a number of years.  Demolishes the CV, making it hard to return to work, and leads to an unbalanced all or nothing relationship with the family.<p>4) Doesn't seem to exist.<p>Option 4) might be a company that specialises in allowing high value people to work limited hours, at what they do best.  It would require a new way of organising things.<p>a) Systems to eliminate the ""fixed cost"" of employing someone, allowing many people to be employed in place of one, at the same cost.<p>b) Systems to allow multiple people to efficiently time share on a task.<p>c) Systems to allow people to rapidly pick up where they left off on a task.<p>d) Systems to allow a person to remain up to speed on a discipline, even with restricted working hours (ie. reducing the fixed cost to the employee).<p>It would be interesting to see how such a company would go competing against traditional a company of full-time employees.  Assuming the negatives a)-d), above, could be solved, the benefits would be:<p>i) A fresh, productive, low stress, ""burn out free"" workforce.<p>ii) With some flexability of hours by healthy workers, the elimination of holes in the workforce, due sickness or unexpected events.<p>iii) The ability to very rapidly bring extra resources to bear (eg. some people work 4 days/week) under special circumstances.<p>iv) A larger employment pool, by including people who would would normally be precluded from full-time work.  (How to make the model work well while not eliminating those who want a full-time job.)<p>Points a)-d) would seem to be fodder for a start-up, which would dog food its own system.

The theft being private losses socialized via bailouts, govt deficits to prop the economy, and QE.  It occurred at time t, but the loss isn't felt till t+n, so there's a lag during which most people grumble but mostly are indifferent.<p>t+n will be when either:<p>1.  Prices begin to hyperinflate commensurate with the multiple rounds of Federal Reserve QE.  This could happen if Bernanke, Krugman, et all turn out to be wrong about the ability to hyperinflate the currency into a liquidity trap without commensurate price rises, then contract the money supply again as the economy emerges from the liquidity trap, thereby avoiding price hyperinflation.  It could also happen if their exit strategy is wrong.<p>2.  Foreign governments stop buying US debt en mass, forcing higher interest rates to entice buyers (or more Fed buying, further increasing money supply, see #1), leading to a slowdown and recession or depression.<p>3.  Despite the Fed's best efforts to the contrary, a deflationary debt collapse domino effect happens anyway, possibly started by the European PIIGS taking the Icelandic route and defaulting on their debt to private banks, and ending with US states doing the same thing, leading to another recession or depression.  Most unlikely scenario.<p>There's nothing free in this world, and those losses are going to paid for by someone, one way or another.  The financial system has already ensured it won't be them.

All in all, that would be a small price to pay for your life, but we're inconvenienced by the fact that prostate cancer doesn't usually kill people. Most men will die of other causes long before prostate cancer gets them. For example, while <i>over 80%</i> of men between 70 and 79 have prostate cancer, only <i>3%</i> will die from it.

The only things we ""need"" to do are reproduce, and find food and shelter towards that end. It's crazy that we have blown past the struggle for survival so far it's almost been forgotten, like the binary code under our lovely Ruby scripts.<p>But we still feel the flutter of our primal fears for survival, even in the abstraction, and fight to the death over increasingly excessive piles of wealth, as if we might not ""survive"". And because we do that, in the global picture not everyone DOES survive. If you are convinced you do not have enough to survive, it's very hard to share.<p>Even worse, as our personal bar of ""survival"" continues to rise in this abstract world, our frantic and instinctual struggle to ""survive"" is apparently driving us towards an incredibly sad and ironic demise - if you believe the headlines about nuclear war and global warming.<p>I agree with the article's idea that as technology takes care of more and more basic needs we should move to ""information-based products"" to keep ourselves busy and satisfied. We have to. All the world's billions can't have two cars in the garage, but they can all have giant digital art and music collections.

2536046,comment,2535419,2535820,2,0,dpatru,,,"Government regulation is in just about every case either not needed at all or better provided through non-coercive institutions. Since government innovates more slowly than private industries, government regulation tends to become outdated, going from common-sense prudence to arbitrary burden on innovation. For example, right now the Mississippi River in the US is flooding, destroying many homes. This is a huge loss partly because homes are very expensive. Maybe it would make sense to have some housing constructed of paper-mch, not try so hard to resist disaster, but instead concentrate on making it cheap to rebuild. Government building codes prevent this kind of innovation.<p>Regulation reflects a lack of creativity. It says, ""There is no other way to do this."" But maybe there is another way and the politicians just can't think of it. They shouldn't be allowed to limit other, more enlightened people.<p>The above assumes that regulations are honestly designed to promote the public good, a dubious assumption. Often I suspect that regulation is designed to protect influential but inefficient businesses against competition.",1305115004

Its intended objectives are admirable but I don't believe it will accomplish them nor benefit consumers in the long run.<p>By artificially imposing a high barrier to entry (licensing fee), the consequence will be to encourage the formation of monopolies.<p>Furthermore, payment companies will have a lesser incentive to secure their service or build a reputation of trust since consumers will be led to believe that ""all payment companies must be secure since they are all approved by the government"". What was once an important competitive advantage will lose a lot of its importance.<p>There are probably other perverse effects I could think of but my point is that things are much more complex than they might seem.",1305113578

67238,comment,67216,67231,0,0,robmnl,,,"Checked out your homepage, you have a good project description.<p>I had the same problem you had: being overwhelmed with tasks in my task management software. I solved it quite simply by marking certain tasks as ""in progress"". That allows me to see what I should be focusing on - and if I'm not, I re-evaluate where I am at, and set different tasks to ""in progress"" that make more sense.<p>For sure not as thought out as your solution - yet it has been working fine for me. Yours is for a team though, much more complex/interesting problem. Nice work & thoughts.",1192264131

In a sense, our system establishes workflow as the spine of business networking, allowing businesses internally (staff) and externally (with their customers and vendors) to collaborate on any project.  We have been coding since January and are finally launching our private beta next week.

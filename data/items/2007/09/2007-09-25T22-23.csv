59596,story,,,19,43,steffon,"What do you think of my startup idea?",,"I studied a lot of sociology in college and noticed a way that one could organize communities around their shared preferences of content so that people could discover new content with what should be a much higher degree of relevance then current recommendation systems.<p>I'm calling it a discovery engine, where the user can enter the name of a specific piece of content they have in mind, or something they are generally interested in, and receive recommendations of new content from like-minded people.<p>Just like Wikipedia issued a call to all people interested in making an encyclopedia, this would issue a call to all early adopters to be recognized as authorities and trend-setters.  Think The Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell, but taking place online, efficiently, and transparently.<p>The project calls for combining social-bookmarking and user-generated media with an algorithm that both aggregates similar collections of content into networks and makes recommendations of content based on the evolving network structure.  The ranks of ""influence"" and ""in the know"" are measured against networks of users with similar collections of content.  These two rankings incentivize users to continually post relevant content because they want to remain ""influential"" and ""in the know"" in front of the people that are genuinely interested in the same content.   The majority of users coming to Topiat for recommendations receive relevant recommendations fueled by the work of those who are genuinely influential and in the know.<p>But unlike current recommendation systems, which are domain specific and treat an individual as the sum of all their preferences (e.g. Netflix), the discovery engine would allow users to create networks based on all types of content (any combination of music, products, images, videos, URLs etc.) and enables users to explore different interests they have with the ability to create multiple groups of content on their profile.  Each group of content becomes aligned with similar groups of content, from which recommendations are generated and delivered to the user (e.g. my oldies music compared with users with similar tastes in oldies music, my surfing group compared with other users that think of surfer the same way I do).<p>I'm putting together a Y combinator funding proposal based on this basic idea and am looking for feedback before I send it in.  If there are any developers that like the idea and want to know more, let me know.  Additionally, if you are good with machine learning techniques (e.g. neural networks) and are interested, let me know.

59592,comment,59510,59510,0,0,anamax,,,"""older"" isn't the relevant factor, and neither is market value.<p>First ""market value"".  All other things being equal, someone who has a typical salary of 300k has a lot more opportunity to save for a couple of years of no salary and will find it easier to come back to a decent salary if the startup fails than someone who only makes 20k.<p>However, all other things are not equal.  The relevant factor is overhead.  Overhead is associated with age but isn't determined by age.  For example, young folks supporting other folks have exactly the same problem as older folks supporting other folks.<p>Note that overhead is typically the result of choices and comes with benefits.  Those with less overhead typically made different choices and don't get the benefits.  Also, ""young founders"" are often delaying overhead.<p>Note that overhead contributes little/nothing to a startup's odds of success.<p>BTW - One could argue that the market actually undervalues not-yet-known-to-be-successful 22 year old founders.

I don't think web developers have to think about disk I/O unless they're Google or Yahoo. ...""</i><p>I'm not sure about this. <p>For <i>""any""</i> interactive Webapp, speed is important. If you have repeated queries to/from, DB I/O does come into the picture when peak loads occur. So right when you get lots of users, the site will be hit. I've seen this with e-commerce (where user speed == $$$) where sure enough every peak time the server(s) would begin to grind. Remember your max speed will be determined by bandwidth. DB I/O will have some effect to slow response times. Maybe not as much as bandwidth but it is still something you must consider.  Not every site is as extreme as e-commerce but the idea is still valid.<p><i>""... Every Web usability study I have conducted since 1994 has shown the same thing: users beg us to speed up page downloads ...""</i> ~ <a href=""http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9703a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9703a.html</a><p>Why is it important?  Well user perception is one. <p>user:  <i>""Gee your application is slow compared to google, a bit slower than amazon""</i><p>developer: <i>""But google invests squillions in hardware, network connections . Their applications run in memory. My apps run on fast hardware, I optomise for small pages ....""</i><p>user: <i>""... So, it still appears slow""</i><p>If a user thinks your site is slow (and if you subscribe to the idea that you are creating web applications as apposed to documents) you need to keep your response times as close as possible to applications that people use every day.<p>It doesn't help that developers constantly throwing new (unoptomised) techniques to do new things at the same time larger sites are optomising to improve their load times, making comparisons between load times inevitable ~ <a href=""http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/performance/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/performance/</a>

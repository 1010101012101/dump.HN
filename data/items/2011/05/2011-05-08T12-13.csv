2525788,comment,2525025,2525181,1,0,premchai21,,,"> Inside on* handlers and style attributes, the rules are different.<p>That may be so, but I'm not sure I'd call that an HTML escaping problem per se.  An attribute always has an additional syntax, and you have to account for the subsyntaxes of whatever attributes are in placebut those aren't at the HTML layer proper, only implied by it.  E.g., a's href attribute takes a URI.  onfoo attributes take JavaScript code.  style attributes take CSS.  So in order to make HTML safe (FSVO safe) when it contains those attributes, you have to make those values safe recursively according to their subsyntaxese.g., if you want to allow CSS with url(), then you have a URI inside CSS inside an HTML attribute inside an HTML document inside (for instance) a UTF-8 string, and you have to take all the layers into account.<p>It may be that a lot of people don't realize there's several potential layers of syntax involved, think of it as a monolithic and simple thing, and then get confused when it is not.  Things like PHP htmlspecialchars can inadvertently encourage this kind of inaccurate view.<p>(I'm not disagreeing with you exactly, just describing from a variant perspective.  A bit of redundancy in discussion can create an antialiasing-like effect.)",1304859028

So the verbosity advantage of html tables is down to ""tr"" being shorter that ""display: table-row"". That is not really a serious objection.<p>Btw., if you don't want a seperate stylesheet, you can embed the css style information directly in the html:<p><pre><code>    <div style=""display: table; width: 100%""><div style=""display: table-row;"">
      <div style=""display: table-cell; width: 200px;"">Fixed left column.</div>

2525770,comment,2523824,2525592,3,0,flipbrad,,,"The author is right to skewer the particular targets of his essay in this way (the so-called Bullingdon set), but please don't take this as a skewer of the Oxbridge system itself, or you risk dramatically underestimating what it demands and delivers. I don't think that's what the author set out to do, and I think he perhaps does in fact colour the bullingdon set's experience of Oxford. I think he's particularly correct to attack how alien the British ruling elite is to scientific principles - uncertainty, testing, evidence, statistics, falsifiability. How fresh it would be to see politicians espouse such principles. This rejection is facilitated by their training in Classics, History or English Literature, and the ego boost one receives from Oxford when one is this particular type of person; typically, they'll be active in the Oxford Union, or be seen down at the Bridge club on a thursday night.<p>However, don't extrapolate this to a 'normal' undergrad's experience at Oxford.<p>I've never worked as hard in my life as for my MBiochem finals at Oxford - my law conversion is widely depicted as being intense, but didn't compare.<p>If the author of that article truly believes oxford tutorials are about defence, he's getting shortchanged, or he's looking to them for exactly the same thing our ruling elite gets from them; either way, he's shortchanging his readers in giving voice to such a view. The true aim of a tutorial is not to spend an hour defending what you wrote two nights ago, it's about letting that stuff fall into the backdrop to a cutting edge discussion with a leading (often foreign) academic; not just getting a better picture of what the cutting edge is, but where it's likely to develop to and what could be investigated over the next few years so we can get there. In UK undergraduate education, my understanding is that this focus on developing questions and probing soft spots in knowledge, rather than just assembling and defending answers, is pretty radical. And it certainly seems to run contrary to a fair amount of the article's claims.<p>Admittedly most of a tutorial's exchange of ideas flows <i>to</i> the student, but I rarely met a tutor who won't admit to having got something out of tutorials they have given, too.",1304857382

495726,story,,,8,8,geuis,"Ask HN: easy resources for learning Python?",,"I'm wondering if the community can point me to some easy resources to getting started with Python, starting from the basics of basics up to advanced usage.<p>I had an interview a couple weeks ago with a kickass startup company, who's owner frequents HN, for a front-end engineer position. Unfortunately, it turned out the role really needed someone with Python experience in addition to front-end skills. Needless to say, I was passed over but the interview was great and it was really cool to meet with their team.<p>So, what's the best way for me to transition from a creaky PHP history to Python? I have some ideas for my own startup(s), I'm sick of working where I'm at, but I don't want to fallback on PHP to launch a new service.",1235644651

495719,comment,494856,495364,0,0,ahoyhere,,,"unalone, you're very much correct but there's a nerd skepticism about anything related to ""marketing"" because nerd populations typically are comprised of people who have a hard time with social soft skills and marketing is the ultimate soft-skill trade.<p>Nerds, like every other group, denigrate what they lack/have difficulty with, thus the bleating for naked facts... in direct contrast to how human beings work, of course, but c'est la vie.<p>I actually wrote an article comparing the browser landing pages for Vitamin, based on a talk I did at OSCON (about UX in general).

Also the triangle button (upvote), I use it only as a bookmark button.<p>Also what’s really rewarding is when you check the “New” page and see few hours after it hits the home page.

INCRBY/DECRBY are still missing but in a week I plan to have this, all the Set operations inside and release another beta. Then will be the time of replication and compression.

Hacker News single-handedly keeps my head in the startup game. Bootstrapping would be impossible without this site to act as a virtual startup town square. The stories and comments I read here motivate me better than anything ever has. I used to start projects and forget about them on a nearly daily basis.

Modelling a natural systems (climate) on the one hand and technological progress (AI) on the other hand are 2 enirely different areas. You wouldn't have found a predominance of scientific papers in respectable journals saying they had accurate models of the progress of AI development.<p>> So does room-temperature fusion.<p>You didn't read the post you replied to did you? I'll re- quote the relevent parts.<p>>> This method is designed to ruthlessly root out falsehood. Look at cold fusion. I would imagine there would be no easier way to get funding than the promise of cheap, relatively low-tech, non-polluting, and abundant energy. Yet, Pons and Fleischman were immediately discredited and now stand as objects of ridicule to this day.<p>You don't seem to understand the level of scientific agreement with regards to global warming.

Mainstream users adopt last decade's technology just as the early adopters are finding a new playground.<p>The big question is what's next.

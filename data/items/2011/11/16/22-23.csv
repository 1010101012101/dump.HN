You can't be an American just by liking the culture.<p>> and b) you had some strange interest in me behaving exactly like you, instead of expressing cultural differences.<p>Oh, yeah. That's it.<p>Or, rather, in getting you to use terms that don't suggest racial identity when you don't mean it.<p>> Try this instead: how about you be alright with African-Americans as both African and American, and not give so much of a shit about which cultures other Americans choose to embrace?<p>No. That means that a non-black is either an African American if they embrace the culture - which isn't the way it sounds, or it's a racial/origin term and has nothing to do with culture.<p>Neither is both useful and accurate.<p>Also, Africa doesn't have one culture, even to the extent the USA does. Even if you use the term it's hopelessly inaccurate.<p>Try one of these instead: \n""American who practices xyz-African culture""\n""American, recently descended from Africans""<p>> You obviously can't see what a dick move it is to stand on a soapbox dictate the cultural identities of other people.<p>I'm not saying you don't act like a resident of India.

Get over it.<p>> Why are you unable to understand that this is not a question of what's written in my passport?<p>Because you keep insisting on using broken terminology just to differentiate yourself. That language refers, largely, to what's on your passport.<p>> It is astonishing that you can make the statement of yourself that you are culturally Indian -- so you apparently understand the concept of cultural identity -- but then turn-around and fail to grasp that, when other people say they are Indian-American, they are not making a statement about a field in their passport.<p>He knows that, but he's pointing out they're doing it wrong. Use more accurate language instead of racist-backlash spin terms.<p>> There are no facts in contention here, because you are making a straw man argument -- attacking my argument as though I were making statements about my nationality.<p>Not at all. The argument is you're using the language incorrectly. That millions of others agree with you isn't a counter-argument.<p>> I believe you are being intentionally obtuse by disregarding the fact that it is a statement about cultural identity, which apparently you are fully capable of understanding.<p>We feel the same about you.<p>You know that a more accurate phrase would be along the lines of ""An Indian ex-pat who still practices the culture, but also practices USA culture"" and you refuse to use it because you see it as denying you your racial heritage or some nonsense.",1321483496

But XP stories are generally in the range of a few hours to a couple days. And if you are in a typical XP team room [1], you are near colleagues. You will also likely be writing automated tests that document the change you are making. So a paper trail is rarely necessary; conversation generally suffices.<p>If you need to sketch or write something out to think about the problem, by all means do that. The XP teams I'm familiar with tend to do that by nabbing a couple of colleagues and working through things on a whiteboard that gets erased when a story is done.

Also, a number of successful projects using anything from ""one smart person with it all in their head"" to ""200 index cards taped to the wall"".<p>The most important thing to realize about tracker is that it isn't a process, it's a tool. You still need to develop and tune a process.<p>In particular, if your process is crap, or you put garbage into tracker, you will at best not improve the state of your project and at worst make it more annoying, slow and janky.<p>My concern with process and process tools is limited to optimizing the amount of stuff we get done cumulatively and sustainably over time.<p>Some tips on how to make tracker work for you:<p>* Figure out what size story works for your project.<p>* Write clear, descriptive stories with deterministic criteria to let you know when they're done.<p>* Encourage, honor and make time for folks to elaborate on stories (with possible solutions, constraints or issues).<p>* Refuse to estimate or start stories that are garbage.[1]<p>* Develop conventions around labels; they should have meaning.[2]<p>* If the team doesn't know enough about the problem to estimate a story, log and start a 1-point research story to figure it out in enough detail to write a story that isn't crap. Then fill in the details and estimate the other story.<p>Also, re: focus (""focus your attentoin ... in a huge list of entries."") -- that's a huge problem with tracker and the motivation behind the Chrome extension I'm working on. Even simple filtering by tag helps a huge amount.<p>There's a lot of stuff to say; perhaps I should write another post about this.<p>Jon<p>[1], re: ""I don't know how an engineer can write code without at least being able to fully understand the problem, and then in english, explain the problem and propose a solution.""<p>I don't either.<p>And if a story doesn't serve those needs, I don't consider it estimated or executable. If the person writing stories won't write good stories (time constraints, lack of interest, lack of communication skills) it's fine, but someone needs to flesh them out before they get estimated or executed on.<p>[2], re: story labels: I get a huge amount of leverage out of the following:<p>* blocked_{eng, ops, qa, art, ux, pm} - Cannot be started until someone from a specific team does something to unblock.

Going from information on the next page to information on this page is a big difference; it's one less click, which is 100% less clicks. And it's not just the click, the page has to load, then you have to find the information you want, if it even exists. You could wind up talking fifteen, twenty seconds to do what Google has done instantly.<p>That's a fair point, but truth be told I rarely find myself completely satisfied with Google's extracted results anyway. When I look up movies, I almost always end up going to another page in the end anyway for more information.<p>For instance, if I google ""movies near me,"" it only gives me a list of movies with their running times. It actually doesn't give me any showtimes at all. So I definitely cannot make any decisions based on that list alone.<p>> I'd quibble with this too.

Going from information on the <i>next</i> page to information on <i>this</i> page is a big difference; it's one less click, which is <i>100% less clicks</i>. And it's not just the click, the page has to load, then you have to find the information you want, if it even exists. You could wind up talking fifteen, twenty seconds to do what Google has done instantly.<p>Fifteen seconds isn't <i>a lot</i>, but multiplied by every search you do in your life it starts to add up. Multiplied across the Internet, you start talking about whole lifetimes being wasted-- and multiplying miniscule efficiencies into lifetimes is Google's bread and butter.<p>> It sounds like you're judging a search engine based solely on the information it takes out of links and puts in its own format on the results page, not by the links it provides. While I agree that bells and whistles like extracting certain results into a table on the results page are cool, that hardly seems to me like the ultimate test of a search engine.<p>I'd quibble with this too. It seems to me that extracting the semantic content you're looking for directly <i>is</i> the ultimate destination of search engines. Certainly it is a much more difficult problem than text search.

5440848,comment,5432713,5432713,4,0,ShinyObject,,,"Perspective from a stone-cold atheist/philosophical-materialist that started daily meditation in recent months: there's nothing magical to it, but there is something to it.<p>There are many different explanations as to ""how it works"". These range from greater connections with supernatural beings to just giving your brain some quiet time to perform various housekeeping activities that it doesn't get a chance to do when constantly stimulated with computer/phone/tv.<p>If you want to know ""what can meditation do for me besides waste my time?"", here is my attempt at describing what it feels like and how it's beneficial. This is just my subjective experience.
The first benefit of meditation for me has been to make me aware of the near-constant mental chatter going on in my mind, and presumably the minds of many other people in society. I knew it was bad but I had no idea how bad until I tried to shut it off for a few minutes. It's like when someone points out every time you say ""umm"" in a conversation and you suddenly become aware you are doing it constantly.
As for the second benefit, imagine how you feel when you are in a pleasurable and carefree mental state. For example you are at a bar or a party talking to someone you just met who has similar interests and after 20min you have sort of a full body buzz going even if you haven't been drinking, the rest of the world falls away, and time flies by. Or if you go to the gym or do martial arts and you enter the gym stressed about work, then two hours later you walk out and are driving home, feeling great and the things that were bothering you earlier seem insignificant. Meditation builds a mental muscle that allows you to more easily slip into that groove. I'm still a newbie but there are times that I can slip into that state at will, walking down a crowded street surrounded by people.<p>""Arrgg! stop wasting my time and tell me how this is this going to get me money/sex/stock options!""
If you are still looking for the immediately tangible benefit of meditation in terms of (input x) -> (output y) that will depend on your situation. I can however give you an example. If there is a room full of of stressed out uptight people and someone walks in who is more relaxed and ""present"" than everyone else in the room, other people in the room will notice this, they will subconsciously assume there is a reason, they will be more inclined to listen to that person. They are walking around with empty cups and that person acts like their cup is overflowing.
The joke is the first time this happens you will have the thought ""omg it's working, the 'trick' is working!"" and instantly your new found charisma will evaporate. If you chase it you cannot have it, there are many things in life like this :]<p>As for method, I don't use candles, music, darkness, unusual sitting poses, or any other props. They obviously help some people but I have not tried them. I simply put my phone on silent, set my phone alarm to vibrate in 20min and put it on a table behind me. Sit in a chair and look at a point on the wall, be sure there aren't any screens or clocks in your field of vision to distract you.
Once you are sitting looking at the point on the wall let yourself be present and not thinking about anything in the past or the future. The first two or three times you try this it will feel like the longest 20 minutes of your life and you will find yourself constantly thinking of chores, imagining interactions, and berating yourself for thinking. Don't judge yourself and don't ""try"" to not think. Newbies are often told that if they really need to focus on something, to focus on their breathing.
Normally when you have a thought your mind seizes on the thought like a shark seizes on its dinner. Rather, be like the stone at the bottom of the sea and the thought is like a jellyfish. The thought appears, you are aware of the thought, but you don't engage it, you just let it drift by.",1364261089

I could also search for something like ""movies [zip code]"". I tried it for a few different zip codes and it always got me the results I wanted, but not always through the same site. For one zip code, it brought up the Fandango page for that area, which had exactly what I wanted. For another, it took me right to the showtime page of the only theater in the town.<p>As for ""NBA standings,"" I'm not a huge NBA guy, so maybe I don't know what you wanted, but it takes me right to nba.com/standings, which is the same as the top result on Google. The only difference that I can tell is that Google puts some of the standings in a table on the search results page, which doesn't seem like a huge deal to me.<p>It sounds like you're judging a search engine based solely on the information it takes out of links and puts in its own format on the results page, not by the links it provides. While I agree that bells and whistles like extracting certain results into a table on the results page are cool, that hardly seems to me like the ultimate test of a search engine. Actually I'd say that's one of the least important factors in a search engine, to me anyway.<p>Anyway, with all that said, I don't have anything against Google. I just don't agree with your assessment of DuckDuckGo.<p>Edit: That's not to say DuckDuckGo is perfect. I queried my own name and found that DuckDuckGo didn't pick up on all the stuff that Google does about me. For instance, I can't seem to find my linkedin page through DuckDuckGo at all.<p>Still, honestly, I think it seems pretty decent for a search engine. Not better than Google, but certainly useful.<p>Edit2: DuckDuckGo actually has some cool features that Google does not.<p>Search ""password generator"" on DDG and it actually generates a password for you above the search results. Search ""hackage reactive-banana"" and it gives you a summary of the Haskell package above the search results.",1364260109

Not addressing them is the best course of action.<p>Further I don't really see evidence of this having caused more fear among women in tech. In fact one of the more popular blog responses was written by a woman, speaking out against _both_ Adria Richards and the Twitter Idiots. Guess she forgot to retract into her shell for that one.<p>>There was plenty of aggressive examination of what Adria Richards did<p>Which is how it should have been. She handled the situation in a shockingly ridiculous way. _Shockingly_. And it turned out she had a history of doing such shockingly antagonistic things to anyone who wasn't black and/or a woman. People must know that being a member of a ""protected class"" isn't a license to be a complete asshole, and it isn't a license to abuse your professional standing to further your political cause. We need to foster a culture of civility all-around.

You are entitled to your opinion <i>but not your own facts</i>. However inconvenient the actual facts may be to you. Sorry.<p>The <i>facts</i> are that it was the public sector that provided the seed funding for the Internet. The private sector was useless for that. We actually have a controlled experiment, because we saw what the private sector was capable of producing, and that was crapware like AOL and Lotus Notes.<p><i>The entirety of the modern internet (and web) in most countries was built privately.</i><p>which is not only wrong but also <i>entirely irrelevant</i>, because that only happened after the Internet had already been created, entirely with US government funding as it happens. That investment only happened ""naturally"" for the Internet, the public sector contender that the government had built, because it was the only one good enough to invest further in.<p>We know that that infrastructure build-out would not have happened ""naturally"" for a purely private sector-seeded system, because we saw it not-happen for Lotus Notes, the private sector contender, because it was so unpromising. Had there just been the private sector efforts, you would not be able to buy books online at all today.<p>With the exception of a few places like the old AT&T labs, the private sector simply does not do really early stage projects, but the public sector, or more precisely the non-profit sector, can. This is because non-profits (almost by definition) can provide some funding for projects that don't need to be justified for a specific payoff.<p>In other words, the reason that the non-profit sector is better at seed funding is precisely because ""The primary motivator and driver for ARPANET had nothing whatsoever to do with us being able to buy books online.""<p>We are buying books online roughly 50 years after Paul Baran's packet switching. What's the net present value for a 50 year payoff? Which venture capitalist is going to invest in your project for that? Answer: nobody.<p><i>every military initiative because they might develop into amazingly useful civilian projects</i><p>This is not true. It's just very difficult to convince Americans that their taxes should pay for seed funding for healthcare or for buying books online, but very easy to convince them to pay up for whizzy new bombs for dropping on people who look like me.

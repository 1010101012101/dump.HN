Youtube is the one deciding to silence the videos, not the user.",1231988347

434729,comment,434698,434698,0,0,jwilliams,,,"Basically it'll be a limitation of the Access Point, and the actual spectrum.<p>All of those clients will be connecting using the same frequency band - and Wifi uses a spread spectrum approach (basically), which means that whilst you can connect more clients, the quality degrades each time you add another.<p>The most I've ever seen connected was 30. I've heard of commercial grade AP's that claim to handle 60-120 clients (for airports and such).<p>This interference also depends on how the clients are actually using the network - if they're all downloading at once, I'd guess it would get saturated very quickly. Maybe as low as 10 (just a guess). If they are all relatively idle you could probably get a lot of clients on.<p>It's also not helped by the fact that certain clients and AP's do not interact well with one another (due to slightly different interpretations of the spec)... It's also not helped by other devices operating in the 2.4Ghz range. e.g. Cordless phones and such. I think microwaves also put out a of 2.4Ghz noise too.<p>However, you can run multiple access points - you just run each access point on a different channel. The trick here is that wifi channels actually overlap with one another, so pick ones next to each other and they'll interfere with each other (i.e. slow each other down). However, you can pick channels that don't overlap. IIRC in the US these are 1,6,11.<p>(p.s. This is also a good tip if you're in an appt building. If there are lots of other AP's take a look at the channel they're on and try and get on a clear band).<p>Theoretically you could also run (one or more) 5ghz wireless N network in parallel with this. Modern macs will be able to connect to this.",1231988292

434713,comment,433589,433666,0,0,spc476,,,"Watterson convered this in some of Calvin and Hobbes reprint books, but basically, a Sunday strip is at most 12 panels (call it 12 units) long.  By modern convention, you have a 4-unit title panel, a 2 unit panel with a single throw away joke (or two 1 unit panels with a throw away joke), leaving 6 units left for the main Sunday joke.<p>A newspaper then has several options for displaying the Sunday comic.  They can run the full 12 units.  They can eliminate the 4-unit title and run 8 units.  They can also substitute the 4-unit title for a 1-unit title and run a 9-unit strip.  They can drop the 2 unit throw-away joke for a 10 unit strip.  They can drop the title and throw away joke for a 6 unit strip (smallest they can run).<p>After Watterson's sabbatical in the early 90s (I think it was 1990), he fought for a full 12-unit (in a 4x3 layout), and won (since his strip was so popular), in which he was able to work without any constraint.  He could basically do a huge 1-unit Sunday strip, or a 24 small panel strip, or strips without panels, or what ever he felt was needed for the Sunday strip.  The artwork for the late Calvin and Hobbes Sunday strips was phenomenal and probably nothing like it had been seen for 60 or 70 years (and nothing like it since).",1231987319

If the person at the top doesn't care passionately about design, it isn't going to just well up from below.  Employees who care about design and have a good eye for it will fail to get recognized, and see that happen to others, and they'll get demoralized and leave.<p>Certainly I hope Jobs gets well, but if he doesn't, I think the key for Apple will be picking a successor who cares about the same things he cares about.",1231987274
434711,comment,431703,431719,0,0,TheMadScientist,,,"I agree with those who have advised you to just start programming. Pick something that seems interesting and write a program that does it.<p>I learned C by writing a (heads-up limit hold 'em) poker program. I didn't use any libraries other than <stdio> and <stdlib>, so I had to re-invent the wheel in some cases. It ended up being about 1000 lines (not counting comments and excessive whitespace used for clarity), and it was just a text-based interface that could keep track of the state of a poker hand, allow you to make decisions, have the computer player respond semi-randomly, and determine the winner.<p>I used the Deitel & Deitel textbook, but I didn't do any of the exercises or try to memorize anything. Memorization and exercises are overrated (unless you are going to be tested on the material). It's better to just read a chapter, come up with your own example that uses the concepts explained in the chapter, and refer to the book as necessary.<p>After I wrote the rudimentary poker program I wanted to make it smarter, so I wrote a tic-tac-toe program that used a recursive minimax algorithm to search the game tree. I ended up losing interest in the original poker program, but have since become a game programmer.<p>Don't become a ""programmer"": become a ""web programmer"", or a ""game programmer"", or a ""compiler writer"". Don't learn how to program just for the sake of knowing how to program--instead, learn how to write a specific type of program that you find interesting. You'll be more motivated and will achieve tangible results sooner.",1231987162

The US Medical Licensing Exams are computerized. Many schools, including ours, are exploring administering computerized exams also. Building computer lab facilities to support conducting a computerized test with 180 people seems a bit over-the-top. The often suggested alternative is to administer the test over wireless. Virtual machines and other security concerns aside, when students pile into any of the auditoriums, just for class, it seems like we never get more than 20 or 30 of us connected.

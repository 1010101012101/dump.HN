So go talk to your users.  What do they like about the site?  What would make them like it more?  What do you have to do to make the site so great that they not only use it, but gush to everyone they know about it?  When you get to that point, your problem is solved.",1203047800

If <i>I</i> were a guest on that show, I would damn well find a way to make the fifth grader look smart. Otherwise I would be a <i>spoilsport</i>, a far greater sin in American culture than pretending to be stupid.<p>Replace Ms. Pickler with the all-time Jeopardy champion, and the show is boring. The guy just gets everything right, the kids get frustrated, the premise falls apart. Then they leave him on the cutting room floor. Not much of a way to get ahead in your career.<p>I'd say that Pickler did an excellent job -- her bravura performance as an idiot seems to have landed her a mention in the <i>Times</i>, made her extra famous on YouTube, and probably boosted her asking price for her next gig. Now even <i>I</i> have heard of her, and I've never watched five minutes of <i>American Idol</i>!<p>Whether or not I think that such a show should exist is a different question, but that's kind of beside the point. Who am I to decide? I am pretty sure that, in a culture that has spent fifty years promoting egghead-positive television like <i>Jeopardy</i> and the more recent <i>Millionaire</i>, this kind of parody is bound to become popular now and then.",1203047718

116276,comment,116169,116169,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Another thing to consider:<p>We've been about 70% complete for version 1 roughly half a dozen times now.  We were 70% complete in April of last year, which we actually did release (it's getting users now, but not many).  We were 70% complete in October, when we sent along a demo with our YC app.  But we realized that it wouldn't work for the general case, so we went back to the drawing board.  We were 70% complete in November, when I realized we were rewriting things too much with each additional feature and stepped back for a week to actually design the thing.  We were 70% (well, more like 50% by my reckoning) complete in December, when we switched web frameworks.  We're about 70% complete now, though if this is anything like past 70%s, it's probably more like 40%.  Now I don't trust any estimate that's not backed up by Trac tickets.<p>Always remember the 90-90 rule: ""The first 90% of the work takes 90% of the time.  The remaining 10% takes the other 90%.""<p>Many startups have to go through multiple rewrites before they have something useful - Reddit's on their 3rd (though they launched with their first), I heard Xobni had to redo their first try to be more ambitious, YouTube completely revamped the site to make it stickier, my last day job went through about 4 rewrites before we launched the product (which is the 7th product it's launched...none of them really got product-market fit), the job before that changed directions 4 times in the year I was there and completely rewrote things about a half-dozen times, never actually releasing anything.<p>I'd look at the stuff you do now as exploratory programming; your job is to find out more about the area, so that it eventually gets to the point where it ""clicks"" and you can just crank out code that works.  You're still very early in the product process; a cofounder could add a lot of value down the road.",1203047651

You have to budget time for it every day, especially early on.   Of course, I'm an advocate of working smart, and hopefully some other people on here will have the kind of tips you're asking for; I'm just saying that pounding the pavement, especially for something that isn't inherently viral, is a necessary but not sufficient part of marketing.<p>There was a good article on Techcrunch a while back about how most of the ""viral"" videos you see on the Web actually have had a lot of effort (and in some cases dollars spent) in getting them out there.",1203047375

  But now on the ground it's the king of our cars
</code></pre>
and thus I now have this interesting and seemingly permanent cognitive mapping in my mind between Massachusetts, the Beach Boys, MIT, Lisp, and ""car"".  Lisp without car, to me, would just be awful...  but for reasons that likely don't apply to anyone else on the planet.  :-)",1203046650

116258,story,,,5,22,brlewis,"Ask News.YC: I need remedial marketing lessons",,"I know there are some people on news.yc who are not only hackers, but have business savvy, and I really need some advice.<p>I started my project because existing photo-sharing sites didn't do what I wanted.  Like a lot of parents, I'm busy and don't have a lot of time to organize photos.  I made a site that automatically organizes in a nice layout that scales easily to several years' worth of photos.  For anybody who has a backlog of photos that tell a story (kids' activities, travel, etc.) I strongly feel I've made the best site.<p>The problem is I've chosen the worst market.  Yes, there are lots of parents out there with piles of photos on their hard drives.  Yes, they're interested in sharing them.  But no, their hair is not on fire.  Photo sharing is one of many good things they'd like to get around to some day.<p>I have about ten people actively posting photos to the site, but they're all people I've directly talked to and/or shown the site to.  What does it take to go viral?<p>Or where do I turn next to find the right customers?  What I've ended up with is a lot like a blogging site, but with much better photo support.  But bloggers tend to pick one platform and stick with it.  Where do new bloggers come from?<p>Some private schools want to draw parents in more to what's happening inside the school.  School administrators have little time.  I have something that lets you instantly document recent events.  Is that a market I should pursue?<p>I've integrated with Piclens for slideshows.  I can send traffic their way; perhaps I should get them sending traffic my way.  Are there other services I could integrate with that might boost my marketing/sales efforts?<p>Is there some other way to go viral with busy parents that I haven't thought of?<p>If any of you have a few months' worth of digital photos that lend themselves to chronological organization, could you take 5 minutes to try ourdoings.com and see if there are any rough edges, or if you notice any points where I'm missing an opportunity to make things viral?

Yes, an all cash deal would have been preferable to what we&#x27;re getting. So would a 5x higher deal price.<p>I&#x27;m sure lots of startup employees make a hash of things when they&#x27;re first presented with an uncertain windfall in the form of restricted stock. It&#x27;s a risk we&#x27;re all aware of and need to manage for ourselves, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we&#x27;ve somehow been dealt a raw deal.",1402081199

7859728,comment,7857315,7859449,6,0,dkrich,,,"In response to poster below: I&#x27;ve actually had a great deal of success by emailing people. Most people assume that everyone has developed a shield that will bounce any email bordering on a sales pitch. The reality is that whether this happens is entirely dependent upon how you frame the conversation.<p>Being small is an immense advantage here. You can speak to the person in a way that a larger company can&#x27;t. &quot;<i>Hi, I live nearby and am interested in what you guys do.</i>&quot; That tenor of conversation has landed me two extremely lucrative contracts.[1] The conversations did not begin with &quot;I need to sell you this thing.&quot; but rather &quot;Tell me about your business and what you guys do day-to-day.&quot; To do this you don&#x27;t even need to know anything about the industry at the outset (although it certainly helps if you do). After enough gigs you get <i>really</i> good at quickly dreaming up ideas that can help people that they have absolutely zero idea are possible or where to begin to develop them.<p>When you or I think of getting cold-emailed sales pitches we cringe because the typical sales pitch we receive is insulting.<p>&quot;<i>You should pay me for x even though I know nothing about you or your needs. Because of this, it is obvious I am not just selling you, but thousands of other people too.</i>&quot;<p>However when you think of a sales pitch as a genuine attempt to start a conversation that you really believe would benefit the person you are attempting to sell to, you are actually helping them, not spamming them. People are receptive to those who express a genuine ability to help them.<p>[1] One contract, ultimately worth mid five-figures came about after being in contact with a particular business owner for two years. The sales process isn&#x27;t necessarily a sudden spike but rather a gradual climb.",1402081185

7859701,comment,7857889,7857889,4,0,tunesmith,,,"The embedded debate about &quot;hexagonal&quot; architecture is unfortunate.<p>I think one of the very common sticking points about refactoring and testability is that when trying to demonstrate techniques, you have to pick simple examples to isolate the techniques.<p>When in reality, those simple examples don&#x27;t <i>need</i> those levels of abstraction or indirection.  DHH&#x27;s gist is a perfect example of demonstrating something that - by itself - doesn&#x27;t need to be refactored in that manner.<p>But it completely misses the point.  Those refactoring techniques are essential for when your codebase is 100 or 1000 times more complex.  (Jim W. mentions this explicitly in his youtube video.)  But the problem is you&#x27;d never show that complex a codebase in a demonstration, because the mental load in understanding the prerequisites (before getting to the actual refactoring) is too large.<p>I think another common sticking point is that people talk about refactoring to make a codebase more testable.  And that is a worthy aim and all, but making it more testable isn&#x27;t the end goal.  Making it more testable forces you to separate your concerns/layers, and <i>that&#x27;s</i> the goal.  The reason that is the goal is because as your code grows, you still want the product to be easily changeable so it can be quickly responsive to customer&#x27;s needs.  And if you need to switch out your data repository implementation on short notice due to your site being suddenly popular, that&#x27;ll be easier/faster if that implementation is separated out.",1402080912

We didn&#x27;t do that; instead, we let threw out all of that knowledge, the good and the bad, and we have 100 million sick people in the US and over a billion around the world.<p>I&#x27;m a firm believer that we can find good answers in science, but we are doing a piss-poor job and have been for 50 years. In fact, I&#x27;d go so far to see we&#x27;ve done very little nutritional science over the last 50 years; instead, we&#x27;ve done nutritional marketing in white coats.

I like to read on my own and the direct experiencing with the author with their characters and stories, and forming my own interpretation. I&#x27;ve read Harold Bloom&#x27;s literary criticism and found it wanting, like an old man hanging onto the vestiges of the past century of whatever someone called the &quot;Western Cannon&quot; and isn&#x27;t his theory of authors&#x27; &quot;anxiety of influence&quot; a bit formulaic, a little bit derivative, a little bit obvious. Not everyone attended Execter and then attended Yale and took Harold Bloom and Bloom&#x27;s mentor&#x27;s literary course and read from Shakespeare to Dickson to Faulkner, and said &quot;yes&quot; eagerly and thusly beamed at his literary professor&#x27;s exaltations as the sunbeams shifted dramatically its orientation on late New England spring afternoons through the ivied windows in the harrowed lecture hall. How do you go about to qualify Jack Kerouac and Murakami who takes as much influence from Jazz? Or novels composed of text messages?<p>Conversely, I form my own interpretation from Zora Neale Hurston and Richard Wright and find it a bit presumptuus that these so-called &quot;multi-cultural&quot; AFAM professors cram down their sociological manifestos down in their criticism; why should I care about the African American or Chicano experience told by Henry Gates Sr. pontificating, when I care about my upbringing as an Asian American and see only through that selfish lenses and rightfully so; and instead like the strong black female characters&#x27; sexual awakening and relate to the search for that sexual fulfillment under the strict matriarchy and small-mindedness of her ethnic community that has internalized that hatred and hierachies that was imposed upon them such that the enemy has slowly become themselves,<p>Our reading experiences is a sensuous, viceral and private one and I don&#x27;t see why a literary professor&#x27;s interpretation of that great work is worth than my love for erotica or Michael Crichton or a mom&#x27;s love for Anne Rice or a monkey&#x27;s love for a banana. As for comparing literature to coding, coding in the sense of &quot;startup&#x27;s, exit&#x27;s&quot; is like comparing Emily Dickson to the slave traders traveling in tugboats in deep south, individual monastic pursuit vs. merchantile activity.

7859665,comment,7858000,7859525,7,0,SoftwareMaven,,,"There is more involved than just calories. It&#x27;s surprising that this myth continues to hold, when we understand how differently macronutrients are treated in the body. Calories are a second-order effect: you don&#x27;t gain weight because you eat too many calories, your body demands more calories because it is hormonally/nutritionally imbalanced and, therefore, shunting energy into fat cells instead of allowing it to be used for energy. And this doesn&#x27;t get into the fact that a high percentage of chronically ill patients (CVD, diabetes, dimentia) are thin.<p>Having dealt with being overweight most of my life, I can&#x27;t help but believe the reason the myth holds on is because it is a way to justify judging fat people as less than skinny people since they just &quot;can&#x27;t control themselves&quot;.<p>Eat a better macronutrient ratio, and the body responds positively, even for isocaloric diets, whether for weight loss[1] or for maintenance[2]. But, really, isocoloric doesn&#x27;t mater; what matters is <i>ad libitum</i> eating. Ironically, every study that I&#x27;ve read that compares low carb diets against low fat diets allows <i>ad libitum</i> eating for the low carb but restricts caloric intake for the low fat. Why is that? Even with that constraint, the low carb diets win[3].<p>1. <a href=""http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/early/2014/04/30/ajcn.113.081216.short"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/early/2014/04/30/ajcn.113....</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22735432"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22735432</a><p>3. <a href=""http://nutrition.stanford.edu/documents/AZ_abstract.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nutrition.stanford.edu/documents/AZ_abstract.pdf</a> (I have a lot of respect for Christopher Gardner.

This is the basic level of keeping the books clean, organizing your papers, etc.<p>- Then there&#x27;s a level of prep that it makes sense to do when you think you are getting close to a term sheet, or planning to start to actively seek acquisition.  This is the much more detailed indexing of contracts, covenants, tracking down old shareholders, etc.  Hopefully if you did the above point, this is made easier, since you&#x27;re at least storing everything in one place<p>- Then in the DD phase, there&#x27;s going to be requests that you just can&#x27;t prepare for, because they&#x27;re out of left-field.  If you&#x27;ve done #1 and #2, you can invest most of your efforts on those.<p>But to your point:<p>> If a deal is worth doing, it&#x27;s probably not going to live or die based on how many tens of thousands of dollars you can whittle off closing costs.<p>It&#x27;s almost never a matter of closing costs.  It&#x27;s a matter of momentum and risk.  Yes, if a company is 100% convinced that they absolutely <i>must</i> have your technology/customers/IP/whatever, they&#x27;ll overlook many many flaws.<p>But, if you go into the due diligence process and things are overly messy, it throws up red flags and creates delays, neither of which are in the entrepreneurs favor.<p>The DD folks and legal counsel for the acquirer are there to be a voice of reason and caution - the messier things are, the more likely they are to start cautioning the acquirer.  Typically, the corp dev guys are raring at the bit, since this is what they&#x27;re there to do.  Legal is meant to act as the countervailing weight to that.<p>Risk is unlikely to kill the deal outright, but it could delay things and create uncertainty in the acquirer.  All of a sudden they start talking about putting an extra 10-15% in escrow, or doing an earn-out instead of a straight acquisition, as a hedge.  Or they decide they want to interview a few more customers before they pull the trigger.<p>Which is where delay comes in - the longer the interval between term sheet and deal signing, the worse off for the startup.  Not because of the legal costs, but because:<p>- it&#x27;s disruptive to the business - your whole life becomes dealing with due diligence, not to mention the stress level<p>- it gives the acquirer the chance to rethink their decision or consider another route<p>- business conditions could change - your biggest competitor goes up for sale at a bargain basement price<p>So, in the end, you&#x27;re not optimizing for cost, and prepping for DD is definitely not worth doing pre-product or at the expense of building your business.  But it does reduce risk and improve the likelihood of deal close once you get to that point.",1402080385

IMO it&#x27;s shameful that someone could be a taxi driver in a major city and not be able to navigate to prominent landmarks and neighborhoods. That&#x27;s at least one problem you don&#x27;t have in London, where the drivers give you confidence that they might have actually been to London before.",1402080070

After this conversation the product link was updated to remove the ability to &quot;checkout&quot; with our product.<p>According to their wikipedia page, &quot;In return for selling other merchantsâ products, Fancy takes a 10% cut of every purchase that is made through the website.&quot;<p>Fancy purchases our product at the going rate, charging their consumer the same amount. Where are they collecting/pulling that 10% cut from... Dorsey & Hughes? Is this a standard business practice to resell online vendors goods without gaining consent from them to list?

UberX is another 30+% again on top of that.<p>It looks to me like uber&#x27;s biggest market in NYC is not people who live in outer boros and would otherwise have hailed a green or gypsy cab but people who would otherwise have taken a pre-arranged black car because hailing a cab is for the proles.

The actual numbers are usually 4 year vesting of founder shares, so they get about 6% of their allocated shares per quarter.<p>Employees also typically also get refresher equity grants, eg. my initial options package at Google was worth less than half the total equity I received in my 5 years there.  And new stock is issued in fundraising events, so ownership percentage of the company <i>does</i> tend to decay with a half-life of a bit less than 17 years (eg. Bill Gates owned 66% of Microsoft at its founding, had about 26% IIRC in the late 90s, and now owns only about 3-4%).<p>I think you&#x27;re completely ignoring the fact that there is a liquid and very competitive market in the founder/labor market.  If employees were getting a raw deal at startups, they would quit to become founders, driving down the supply of employees and up the supply of startups until they start getting better equity grants.  I&#x27;ve done that; I&#x27;ve been an employee at 2 startups and one big company, and am now founding my second startup.  Anecdotally, I know many others who have also bounced between working for startups and founding startups.<p>I think a more likely explanation is that a massive number of startups die before ever getting their first employee.  And so all of those early startup employees who try their hand at being a founder don&#x27;t actually increase the pool of employing startups very much, and are re-absorbed back into the system as early employees at other startups.  If you want a more equitable system, you&#x27;d want something where when people quit their jobs, they have a high chance of being able to make it on their own, and there&#x27;s not a winner-take-all effect where most organizations fail to get traction and the winners absorb those that can&#x27;t.<p>But then, that system already exists as well.

Call them up, don&#x27;t email. But always start by asking if it&#x27;s a good time and offering to set up better time to call if they&#x27;re busy. The call is important because people ignore emails and since it&#x27;s known to be &quot;low cost&quot; to send them it indicates that they&#x27;re probably being generally targeted instead of being called specifically. But being polite and offering to call at another time indicates that you respect their time.<p>2. Give them a quick idea of who you are and why you&#x27;re calling them specifically. How did you find them? Why does what they do interest you? Tell them that you&#x27;re interested in learning more about what they do and what kinds of frustrations they have with their technology. People like it when you are interested in what they do.<p>3. Instead of telling them what you want to do, ask them what they would like to have someone do. People love to complain about their problems, and it&#x27;s good information for you to know. Knowing your potential client&#x27;s problems will make you more conversant when talking to future possible clients. It&#x27;s okay for you to not be able to address their problem, just take extensive notes on anything they say, and instead of trying to solve their issue on the phone or set up a contract right away, just ask questions. &quot;Are there any other things you find frustrating?&quot; is a totally legitimate question, and has given me usually much more useful information than specific stuff.<p>4. If they don&#x27;t seem to be interested, or don&#x27;t feel they themselves have interest in being involved, ask them if they have any ideas of who might be more in need of the kind of thing you can offer, or if they know anyone else who might be able to offer advice on what kind of services you could offer.<p>5.

Big companies dangle their customer base in front of you (<i>&quot;Wouldn&#x27;t you love to get your product in front of our $HUGE_NUMBER customers?&quot;</i>). When you&#x27;re new at this and deep in the slog of trying to grow your startup, that&#x27;s a hard thing to resist.<p>(btw, I don&#x27;t consider having an affiliate program part of partnerships)",1402077833

That&#x27;s bad for a lot of reasons, but mostly because many homes share the same address. Implementing IPv6 means every device in the world has a unique, globally routable address with all ports open (no NAT).<p>That&#x27;s pretty cool. However, we can only do this if we get over the chicken-and-egg problem, which is why it&#x27;s important you enable IPv6 and encourage others to do so.",1402077697

It shows that a workable replacement for an established service business (one suffering from large regulatory capture) is considered so significant from the perspective of these bankers. It also suggests that AirBnB could do really well if they went back to the well (not that I recommend it, money drags you down).<p>But more importantly this looks like an investment in a public company not a startup, or put another way, the difference between preferred and common stock has no doubt reached near parity. If the bankers believe the company will come out into the public markets at 34 - 50B then that puts them in some really rarified territory. Would the wider market share their enthusiasm? Or would this be like Facebook&#x27;s debut, zero to down change for the first 6 - 12 months of existence.<p>The good news is it gives them a chunk of cash for the big fights they are fighting. Of course I&#x27;m curious if the management took any money off the table or if this is all earmarked for lawyers and expansion.<p>[1] I also agree the bubble hysteria is nonsense, whose money is at risk here? the .01% so don&#x27;t sweat it.",1402077649

And the military leadership was not going to surrender.<p>Even after the news came of the Nagasaki bombing (when the Japanese leadership had finally got around to meeting to discuss Hiroshima), the question of whether to surrender (after <i>2</i> bombings) came to a 3-3 tie. Emperor Hirohito himself broke the tie in favor for peace.<p>After recording his surrender announcement for broadcast the next day, elements of the Imperial Japanese Army rebelled, killed the Prime Minister, and invaded the Imperial Palace looking for the recording (which was kept safe by one of Hirohito&#x27;s advisers at great personal risk). You simply can&#x27;t try to evaluate 1945 Japan in 2014 Western terms, you have no clue what the thinking was like.<p>> Thus, even if you argue that the atomic bombs did save soldiers&#x27; lives<p>I&#x27;m arguing that they saved <i>Japanese civilian</i> lives. Again, you have no baseline for what WWII was like if you think soldiers were the only ones to die in land combat. Look at the Battle of Okinawa for an example of what the Japanese Army did to the civilians of Okinawa.<p>And if you want to remove &quot;speculation&quot; from your vocabulary, I recommend Michael Kort&#x27;s &quot;The Columbia Guide to Hiroshima and the Bomb&quot;.",1402077639

Its type system is awesome not only at catching bugs at compile-time, but also at guiding you in your design.  There are a couple of nice-to-have that would be cool though: Haskell-like type classes come to mind, and some minor syntax warts could be improved.  Its implementation is also extremely solid: I always expect the code generated by OCaml to perform well.  With tools like OPAM, getting the latest compiler and libraries is very easy.  Definitely one of my favorite language toolset.",1402077608

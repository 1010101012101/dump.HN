172593,comment,172452,172568,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"By way of clarification I guess I should explain that in Brazil there is a sizable segment of the population that lives in abject poverty.  Frequently inhabiting tenement areas that are really no more than shanty towns, called 'Favelas'. High crime, few educational or employment opportunities, disease and hunger are all found throughout Brazil in these areas.  There is also a racial component as well, as Blacks or darker skinned people are disproportionately represented in the impoverished class.<p>As these types of problems can lead to social unrest, which inevitably impacts politics and trade, I was intimating that the sort of reliance on Brazilian Oil that the author of the article implicitly postulates is unwise.",1209054005

I think, just like one might see on a site like ValleyWag, the content (or in this case, a video comment) that gets the most clicks will often include a pretty girl.<p>You can't ""scan"" the content of video comments like you can, say, this comment.  It's an interesting idea, but seems to disrupt the flow of communication.<p>Case in point, I just watched a 20 second clip of Arrington saying, ""Um.. Uhh.."" and not much more.  His text comments are obviously a tad more engaging.<p>These seem much more suited to a video site, like YouTube, than a comment thread.   Please, Hacker News, don't adopt video comments!",1209053747

At 7 MPG, going from MKE-SFO, might cost an additional 310-350 gallons of gas, at $4-$5 a gallon, or another $1,500 just in gas.<p>I have heard of POD, but I was wondering if anyone else had some ideas?<p>Plan B is to sell everything.<p>Plan C is to put it in storage here in MKE and move with a suitcase to the valley.<p>Plan D is to stay in MKE, reduce costs further and travel to the Valley, at regular intervals.<p>Plan Pipedream, is to get funded.<p>What advice can the group offer?",1209053672

323984,comment,323724,323919,0,0,tesseract,,,"The only way I can think of that this might possibly make economic sense is if they've figured out how to get the waste in the form of large cut-out chunks of metal, rather than chips that oxidize substantially, and can recycle it on site (presumably fairly straightforward, since all the scrap is known to be of the desired alloy composition already).",1223193217
323983,comment,323540,323605,0,0,LPTS,,,"401K?  To get rich.  Fuck that shit.  How about:  ""Never work at a job with a 401K!"" as a rule for how to get rich.  Since your alternatives will then be to be poor and miserable or get really rich, you will be more motivated.<p>Personally, I'd shoot myself in my head if I ever caught myself thinking about protecting my 401K between money markets and equity markets.  Figure out something meaningful.  Name of my game.  Hoarding biosurvival tickets earned working like some chipmunk trying to survive an endless winter that will inevitably kill them, so that you can enjoy the fleeting illusions of stability and more prosperity than your neighbor before your body turns to the same worm food theirs does seems a really shitty way to respond to finding yourself alive on this planet with a good mind and a brief window of autonomy where you might do something really meaningful.",1223193010

That's why this article makes a great point that you just have to ride the rollercoaster of every cycle.",1223192595

323976,comment,323863,323863,0,0,RobGR,,,"I have taken extensive PHP applications and re-coded them as a C/C++ module to the PHP language.  It worked out successfully.   A simple loop in PHP that just does some math and prints our a value, can be 1,000 times faster in C; if a PHP object is created and deleted in the loop, and you do the same in C++, you can get 100,000 times faster.  Your speedup will vary according to what it does, of course -- if it is mostly waiting for a database, you won't see much speedup at all.<p>Contact me if you are looking for someone to do that kind of work.<p>If I were starting a new web app from scratch today, I would code it in C using Thomas Boutelle's cgic library.  Of course, it seems one rarely starts anything from scratch these days.",1223192530
323975,comment,321927,322442,0,0,jonny_noog,,,"Actually I did get your point (although you have made it a bit clearer re: you view on big growth, which I didn't get before), I just don't agree with you re: these companies in particular. I have to say I've gotten some good information from 37Signals' ideas. I don't follow their advice like an unquestioning lemming, I just take what works for me and leave it at that.<p>I can see how 37Signals' marketing might rub some people the wrong way, there's a fine line between productive self promotion and ""boasting"", a line that I think many people who are good at the former may cross from time to time (hasn't everyone felt like smashing DHH square in that pretty boy face of his at one time or another? :P). But however you feel about their approach, you can't deny that they have created a pretty good lifestyle supporting business for themselves and this should be commended IMO.<p>I use Backpack almost every day and it serves my particular needs very well. So I also don't agree with you that their products are not that great. I think Backpack is awesome, it does what I need it to do and doesn't get in my way. Their products are simple and straight forward for sure, but that's what I like.<p>I just think it just sounds like you're throwing the baby out with the bathwater a bit here. But each to their own I guess.",1223192523

It has stages for HTTP server and client, disk IO, gzip, logging (basically all CPU-intensive or IO tasks). Messages between stages are defined in IDL. You can send those over the network via Sun-RPC or JSON-RPC.<p>Not directly related to your request, but still handy: it also has a stage that wraps the Python VM, so you can write parts of your app in Python.",1223191890

It's an idea, so it refers to itself, and it is only worthwhile with execution.  Since it is not executable, then if it is true, it is worthless.<p>Assume it is false.  It is worthless, or only worthwhile inso far as it's falsehood is useful.<p>So, ""Ideas are worthless without execution"" is itself worthless or false and useful.<p>In no (possible) case, is ""Ideas are worthless without execution"" both true and worthwhile.<p>I don't need examples.

What if I ever need to hack some code in or out of my web server (nginx, for example)? What if I need to rewrite some really slow code in a C++-based background daemon that communicates with my main application through protocol buffers or something? That's kind of thing I'm thinking about.",1223190138

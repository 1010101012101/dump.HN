8587445,comment,8583959,8586816,0,0,mturmon,,,"This comment is problematic.  You&#x27;re confusing discrete-state-space models with discrete-time models.  You can have any combination of continuous/discrete Markov process:<p>Discrete states, discrete time: text, etc.<p>Discrete states, continuous time: Poisson counting process<p>Continuous states, discrete time: gambling earnings<p>Continuous states, continuous time: Brownian motion<p>Of course, the term &quot;Markov chain&quot; is restricted to discrete time.  But you have said &quot;Markov model&quot;, which includes all processes with the Markov property (i.e., they forget old state).  The model in the OP was not originally a chain, because the radioactive decay process is continuous-time, but he made it into one.<p>When you say that Markov chains are discretized differential equations, it tempts the reader to think &quot;discretized in time&quot; -- but that&#x27;s called a difference equation.  I think you mean it&#x27;s discretized in state.  I.e., there is a flow of mass from one state to another that is smooth in a diff. eq., and stochastic in the Markov chain.  But that&#x27;s just guesswork.<p>Also, I would not say a martingale is a discrete random walk.  Your statement here introduces the same confusion.  Like Markov processes, martingales can be continuous or discrete in both state-space and time (e.g., Brownian motion is a martingale).<p>I think of a martingale as a mathematical model for a fair game (expected future earnings is zero given available information).",1415663799

8587415,comment,8584558,8586585,0,0,bad_user,,,"Ref counting is not deterministic. First of all because while looping on an atomic reference is non blocking, it is not wait free. Malloc/free are not deterministic either, can be quite expensive and while real-time implementations exist, that&#x27;s not the malloc/free you end up using. With a generational GC allocating new objects involves just incrementing a pointer, deallocating short lived objects happens in bulk, so the cost for short-lived objects is similar to stack allocation. With ref counting memory gets fragmented, apps like Firefox have been suffering for years from fragmentation and for Firefox there was a sustained and very significant effort to fix it.<p>This can only be solved by either doing stack allocation or by building object pools. And this is for people that know what they are doing.<p>Rust is the only language (I know) that tries solving this with the ownership concept in the language, but then Rust will have problems in implementing immutable data structures that can be shared amongst threads, data structures which are doing structural sharing, so people will expect reads to scale, except there will be non-obvious contention happening due to usage of reference counting.<p>The latency in state of the art mainstream GCs is also NOT variable. Good garbage collectors allow you to control the max latency and frequency of STW pauses. That is not the issue for real-time requirements - the issue with real-time being that STW is unacceptable. But so is reference counting.<p>On the memory requirements, I don&#x27;t buy it. My Android phone has more memory and more CPU capacity than my computer did 7 years ago. And I&#x27;m not seeing a difference in behavior to my iPad. Surely for games it pretty bad to drop frames, but most apps are not games and games are using highly optimized engines built in C++anyway.",1415663341

And brains are limited in their ability to do some thing while keeping other things in mind.

Even connected GPS are fairly bad at finding the shortest way if it means running in the other direction for a while and that happens quite often in London and Black Cab driver are quite good at making those kind of info just looking at their gps traffic info.<p>The knowledge is a very useful tool, and in any city, a driver with good local knowledge is what you are looking for, regardless the middleman you use. Technology is only making the trade off of using amateur bearable, and in reality the real value of Uber and others is from the rest of the service provided.<p>A bit like in your example - if you had to go to the bookstore to load a new book on your reader and it could only hold one book at a time, the technological superiority of even the latest generation of kindle would not make them go pass novelty items. Real value of ebook comes from the rest of the services you get from it and that&#x27;s the reason why even with the shit reading experience, the first gen kindle was a success.<p>The anachronism here is the segregation between black cab and minicab in London and the services the legal restrictions on the services they can offer. Although, IMO, that is not nearly as bad in London as people on HN experience in other places in the world. Black cab are meant to hailed on the street, now, without booking, review or other overhead by drunk people and tourists. Some licensing restriction to make sure you get a basic level of service in those circumstances is probably acceptable. If you have time to plan a bit in advance, there is Uber and plenty of competitors that have always been freed from the restrictions.",1415663070

the way it can be used to make a link stand out. In fact, I use this link styling on my personal website for that reason [1].<p>(Note: when using a border-bottom, I’d recommend using a slightly larger line-height so that the line still seems associated with the text above it and not the text below it. This is one of the pitfalls described in the original Medium post [2].)<p>Unfortunately, aside from iOS 8, normal text-decoration underline links have the descender crossing problem.<p>I absolutely took this into consideration when designing SmartUnderline. SmartUnderline literally only applies itself to links with text-decoration underline, nothing else. It even tries to ensure other conditions which make the transformation favorable (display inline, solid background color, etc.).<p>Ultimately I think the before-and-after on the SmartUnderline website tells the best story [3]. No doubt one may appreciate other, very different link styles. (For example, just using a different text color to denote _link_ is a perfectly valid and commonly used technique.) But if you’re using text-decoration underline already, this just makes those links look better.<p>I think blogs, news articles and wikis are some of the primary examples of where these links look best.

These animations are really helpful for people who aren&#x27;t spending their whole day in front of a computer and rely on cues to help their orientation.<p>I&#x27;ve done usability tests where these &quot;issues&quot; came up, whenever a dropdown or any other form of interaction suddenly popped up and the user had to spend valuable time to re-focus to find out what exactly happened and if this was indeed the right control. Additionally animations are also very useful for transition purposes. Guiding the user from one screen to another can be quite stressful when it&#x27;s done in an instant and the user has to understand what&#x27;s happened. This is why Apple&#x27;s guidelines to transition the screens in a horizontal motion were so damn good, because they allowed users to spatially recognize their &quot;position&quot; in the UI. And I&#x27;m glad that the MD guidelines now also state that transitions have to be spatially correct and a screen transition isn&#x27;t just a window jumping out from the center of the screen.

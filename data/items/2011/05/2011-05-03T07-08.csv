For many variants, seq + google = interpretation.<p>2. The FDA is a LOT dumber and slower than you might think. Very few graduates of George Church and David Reich are going into the federal bureaucracy rather than starting companies or becoming profs.<p>If you have ever worked with them, the FDA is the TSA, third tier guys who do ""safety theater"". They assuredly do not keep you safe. They keep their budgets and jobs safe. Their general orientation is ""restrict everything so we can't be blamed for anything, and then cry that we're underfunded when we've bitten off more than we can chew"".<p>This is a much longer story but if you have an open mind on the topic start by googling ""Jeffrey Shuren FDA"" or the lawsuit between the FDA  and the FTCLDF. Or just talk to some friends at biotechs. Most people won't talk on the record for fear of FDA retaliation, just like everyone goes along with the idiocy for the 10 mins the TSA has power over you.  It's not worth losing your company/flight over a stupid rule that a bureaucrat is mindlessly enforcing.",1304409543

He also has a really good outlook on the role of design in startups.<p>Q: So, the best way to get to know somebody is to go drink with them?<p>A: That is absolutely the best way to really get to know a person and what they really like and are interested in because if they are interested in technology, then they will have no problem geeking out with you about Ruby or Node or something for three hours, over drinks; thats when you know that you found someone that could be a really successful cofounder. I think there really is something to doing business in bars. In the early days when there were four of uswe had hired Scott Chaconwe would go to this bar called OReillys, up in North beach. We went there almost every week and thats where we would talk about what we had done. This is after we had started full time and it was where all the decisions were made. A couple of drinks in, you start to just say what you mean instead of thinking so much about whose feelings you are going to hurt or whatever, you say things very bluntly, like, I think we should do this, and I think you are wrong for saying we should do it a different way, and now you can have an honest argument about what needs to get done and what the concerns are about the company or how its structured or how the stock is going to be split. All this stuff will come up over drinks and as long as you are not too drunk, it can be helpful.",1304409105

We are nation of people with millions of people not having access to even to meal even once a day. And that is not by option, but they simply have no way out.<p>We have farmers committing suicide almost everyday, there is no water or very scanty amounts of water in many parts of the country. Unlike the US where is there is proper planning and good infrastructure(Irrigation, equipment, fertilizers, information, equipment etc) for agriculture. Farmers here back in India are purely dependent upon rains(Monsoons) and ancient methods of planting seeds(using cows). The land is often passed on from generations to generation and undergoes division as a part of inheritance due to which most farmers never get a large chunck of land. Adding all this the farmer productivity is very low, there is no support from the government, no rains, no equipment etc etc. And Farmers really are very poor and not as productive as ones in US. And prior to this there was slavery sort of set up, where you give away your whole life for a land lord.<p>The country is very big, and there are too many people. The prices keep on rising. The middle class can't afford even grains and vegetables let alone meat and other stuff. The poor hardly get a meal a day. And few just eat a single roti(Indian flat bread) with salt for the whole day.<p>Compared to this the Americans are feasting everyday. AMERICANS ARE LUCKY, I repeat AMERICANS ARE LUCKY. You are lucky to be eating stomach full everyday, You are lucky to be worrying about iPhones and not hunger and diseases.<p>Be grateful to God and thankful.

This is quite natural: everybody thinks that what they already know about is important, because that means that they know Important Things.  So I'm going to go the other route and tell you things that I <i>don't</i> know about that I wish I did.<p>(Disclaimer: I work for Google.  I didn't overlap with Paul Tyma, but I know people who worked closely with him, and he's generally quite highly regarded.  He also has built something that people want, unlike most of us: he wrote Mailinator single-handedly and ran it off a single box.  So despite NY_USA_Hacker's questioning of his competence, I think he's actually a far better source of advice than anyone on this thread, including myself.)<p>I wish I knew more of:<p>Statistics.  Hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals.  I wish I knew everything that could go wrong when analyzing data, because we analyze a lot of data, and it's really easy to let biases creep in.  I wish I understood better how to slice & dice data by conditions - ""these are the samples that exhibit some particular trait, and that trait affects this other variable in this way, and so our overall result will be biased by...""  I wish I could data-mine large quantities of data and <i>pick out</i> the trends automatically.<p>Neuroscience.  So much of what we do relies upon understanding how people perceive things.  There's been <i>a lot</i> of research in that area lately, and it turns out that people's biases are actually quite predictable.  I wish I knew how.  I wish I knew why.<p>Trade sense.  There's this soft skill called ""trade sense"" that basically refers to knowing what people will be willing to pay for.  Steve Jobs is a master at it.  I suck at it.  It is a fundamental skill for an entrepreneur, because there is no company if people will not pay you for your product.<p>Statistical machine learning.  Basically, the past decade of AI research has discovered that trying to encode a whole bunch of rules into a computer just doesn't work, because the real world doesn't function like that.  Instead, what <i>does</i> work is to feed the computer a lot of data, and then notice patterns like ""if this term appears, this article is <i>most likely</i> X"".  There're a bunch of techniques for this in the literature, they typically aren't taught in undergrad, and they are wonderfully useful.<p>Image, audio, and video algorithms.  More and more data is taking the form of multimedia these days; plain text just doesn't cut it.  Processing multimedia is an order of magnitude more difficult than processing text, because there's an order of magnitude more data.  But this is largely virgin territory.  Well, sorta.  Basic multimedia algorithms have been around since the 60s, but the environment has changed massively in the last decade.<p>Getting along with people.

When it started out the purpose was to solve 'the friendfeed problem'[1] - which was that for each service friendfeed integrated with, they had to write an entire module to implement a client of that services API<p>The thinking was that Gnip would implement the client once, and then expose a standard interface so that a dev could integrate with all of these services using just a single API<p>The second part was that instead of polling, Gnip would push update data to you using XMPP or callbacks.<p>I think they found that there isn't that large a market for apps, at that time or this time anyway, that needed to integrate with a dozen or more services to make paying Gnip worthwhile<p>The second part solved itself through either pubsubhubbub or API's implementing their own callback.<p>Gnip downsized for a while, but saw a resurgence with the Twitter deal. It makes sense for Twitter to offload serving the API, implementing track, etc.<p>I think datasift is a bit different. Actually a bit more advanced since they support many more ways to slice and dice the data, analytics, and more. That space is more like hootsuite and the similar services - you want to mine social network data and extract key analytics. Gnip is more about making API consumption for apps easier.<p>Gnip has 50+ services, Datasift about 6 or 7 - so you can see where they are beginning to diverge.<p>When Gnip first launched, I spent a day with the team as part of covering the launch for techcrunch. My own conclusion at the time was that Gnip was a stop-gap measure between then and whenever the protocols such as PuSH would be stable enough to see wide adoption. There was also the element of outsourcing your API which didn't seem right - Mashery does something similar with outsourcing dev community, API tokens etc. But Gnip have proven otherwise with the twitter deal. (edit: for reasons why twitter would use them, see [4]<p>What could be interesting is Gnip has morphed into part of the old Gnip, with aggregation and normalization, plus something akin to Cloudflare but for API's - while datasift has become a datamining and analytics platform more for internal business use.<p>The space that Datasift is in will be huge. With Gnip I am still a bit indifferent only because I am implementing an app at the moment that talks to a dozen or so different API's and I couldn't see how I would use it or why I would pay for it, but the twitter firehose isn't one of hte API's (but twitter auth is - and Gnip, from what I know, doesn't touch auth at all)<p>As an aside: and interesting point in history is that when Gnip launched twitter totally rejected them, only later to give them access and then take it a step further with a full commercial partnership[2][3]. that was back when the twitter firehose was 5-6 tweets a second, it hit 5k a second yesterday<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.techcrunchit.com/2008/06/26/the-new-datastream-aggregators-friendfeed-and-standards/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techcrunchit.com/2008/06/26/the-new-datastream-ag...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.techcrunchit.com/2008/07/18/battle-over-twitter-opens-up-to-gnip/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techcrunchit.com/2008/07/18/battle-over-twitter-o...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2008/07/18/twitter-plays-nice-xmpp-firehose-data-feed-to-gnip/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2008/07/18/twitter-plays-nice-xmpp-fir...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/2010/11/why-is-twitter-partnering-with-gnip.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/2010/11/why-is-twitter-part...</a>",1304407373

I know a lot of people who are still afraid of terminal (they can't live without TortoiseWhatever and are not familiar with basic terminal commands) and can't live without fancy development environments (like Visual Studio) after years of development. Even more - terminal + editor allows developer to switch between platforms almost without problem (e.g. my usual week consists of developing completely different projects for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux).<p>After all David killed Goliath with sling.

I studied the market relentlessly to try and figure out an algorithm to gain money back; I got back up to $10,000 within the year so finally, I could tell my dad, yeah, were at $11,000, were good, we have a 10% return so far. So, I didnt tell them that I actually lost most of it, initially, but that experience ended up teaching me so much that I actually took the $10K to about $200,000, over the next couple of years.'<p>These 1 page press stories never do justice to the founders.",1304406544

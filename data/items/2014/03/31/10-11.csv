But the HFT traders are providing a value to the market.<p>Restricting HFT will undoubtedly lower liquidity, and maybe even increase risk. That&#x27;s why regulators are so anxious about it.<p>The HFT traders are indeed taking on some amount of risk, which otherwise would be with the stock exchange or the other participants.

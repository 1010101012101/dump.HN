808191,story,,,3,5,ComputerGuru,"Ask HN: Web Language + Framework Most ""Comfortable"" for Desktop Coders?",,"Hi All,<p>First some background. I've been a developer for 11 years and have dabbled with pretty much everything, though my forte is system programming in C/C++ on Windows and *nix. For the past 5 years, I've been doing some light web programming on the side in the form of small- to mid-size projects in PHP, Perl, and ASP.NET.<p>I'm currently contemplating signing on as a cofounder for a foreign startup that I feel has a chance of really making it big, but I won't bore you with my justifications. Point is, I'm going to be the developer for this project (the other cofounders are a businessman and marketing guy).... and I need some help picking a platform.<p>I'm in love with C, C++, and C#. The former two for the control they give me and the latter for its clean abstractions and well-designed high-level interface. However, I can't find a web language/platform that fits with the software developer mentality.<p>JSP is a mess from a deployment/compatibility/maintenance perspective and totally out of the question. Most of my previous web projects have been in PHP and IMHO there's no way to maintain it past a certain point and the language itself is a nightmare, regardless of how you design the project. Besides these two, I'm open to pretty much any and all suggestions.<p>I've dabbled with both Python and Perl though I'd be lying to myself if I claim to be well-enough versed in either to come to a conclusion regarding their use. ASP.NET is just beautiful... except I feel it tries to apply the desktop programming paradigm too literally onto web development, and you end up with an awkward templating system with a slightly-perverted MVC model.<p>Basically, I want to code the system right and make it future-maintainable. From years of coding experience, I know it's not possible to make anything perfect, but you can at least make something comfortable to maintain and fun to write.. so long as you have the right tools in hand.<p>Can anyone recommend a Python, Perl, C#, or even C++ web development framework that works well for developers coming from the desktop (with our OOP obsession, pointer-fiddling, and OCD optimization compulsions)? I've downloaded a couple of the more popular frameworks, but if I want to do it right, it'll way too long to try them all out and do them justice without rushing to conclusions... and I'm hoping someone here has had a similar experience of coming to the web development scene from desktop programming and has some tips to offer.<p>Thanks!",1252273691

808186,comment,807117,808174,0,0,gruseom,,,"It's a great idea. I love it. However, there are only two ways I can see something like that getting built: the large way or the small way. The large way would be as a tool designed to work with one of the major languages/environments. It would have to deal with all the bloatedness that implies, plus the fact that those environments were never designed to provide this sort of transparency or hackability. It would probably be a large corporate project that took years and cost millions; this probably won't happen. The small way would be because one or more hackers decided to build something new that stayed close to the hardware and was designed for this sort of thing. That's much more doable, but puts you well out of the mainstream for a long time.<p>I wouldn't be surprised if people eventually come around to this point of view. It will take a while, though. The current thought is that parallelism will save everything. It could take a decade before people figure out that that isn't going to happen. Maybe then there will be a renaissance of going back and rebuilding things from the ground up. But I'm rambling.<p>""People who are serious about software have to be serious about hardware""... that Alan Kay has a gift for putting his finger on things.",1252273240

808173,comment,808037,808108,0,0,arghnoname,,,"The problem with H1N1 is that the general population has little immunity to it, so containing and controlling it is difficult. Had it been more virulent, this would be very serious.<p>Why this thing is tracked and scientists take it very seriously is that influenza can rapidly mutate and H1N1 _could_ become much more virulent than it is today. The extremely deadly 1918 flu had a first wave that behaves like most flu outbreaks before coming back and killing tens of millions of people.<p>That doesn't mean that will happen this time or that people should get panicky. Catching H1N1 in its current state is probably beneficial because it would confer stronger immunity to what might be a family of influenza that could be around for a while, but its spread is newsworthy. If the news leads to more people staying home when they are sick, even if the symptoms are more minor for them, and we get more herd immunity through increased vaccinations, that's a good thing.<p>EDIT: I just wanted to emphasis that vaccination is definitely preferable to catching the actual disease, even if the latter would give strong immunity to future, similar strains.",1252271706

808161,comment,807117,808115,0,0,gruseom,,,"Well put. It's this intuition that I am feeling the lack of. It's wrong to imagine that one can create arbitrary abstractions for free in high-level languages and let compilers and fast hardware take care of the rest. That approach takes you so far, but when you run up against its limits you are really in trouble. That is most true when what you're working on is computationally hard somehow, but it also manifests itself in the reality that most software is simply slow (a handy example being the browser I'm writing this in, FF 3.5).<p>This is changing my view of programming languages. I'd like an environment where abstractions are built up in transparent layers that don't hide the underlying architecture, but still give you powerful operators to compose things. The standard options mostly require you to pick one or the other.<p>Put differently: rather than thinking of expressive power as being built up in layers that move the highest level ever further away from the lowest, is there a way to keep high and low relatively close together while still providing lots of expressive power? The closest thing to this that I know of are Arthur Whitney's languages. The latter are notoriously cryptic, but unless I'm mistaken they do provide both of these things: an execution model that is close to the hardware and a very high-level, logically scalable language.",1252270961

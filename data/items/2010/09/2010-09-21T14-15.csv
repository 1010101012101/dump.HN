Oh, and also having almost no way of changing your situation, no matter how hard you try. Surprisingly, these people were in general happier than well-off people in America, because they had a strong faith, strong families, strong relationships with others in their community, and were just plain tough.<p>I guess after visiting a third world country and seeing how hard the truly poor work every day, how much they care for what little they have, and how thankful they are for everything, I feel a little less sympathy for the ""poor"" in America. I wish they could spend a few weeks in a truly poor country, and then realize what an amazing land of opportunity they live in.",1285081169

Renting implies that you are paying the company a monthly fee to use it, which rarely happens with packaged software (unless you are buying support or paying for some sort of service).

You just can't share it with all of your friends for free or start selling multiple copies of it (which is understandable).<p>""Now, you are within your rights to be both dumbfounded and irate if you are told years later by the builder of the house (or car manufacturer) that you cannot sell your home or your car to another party because they have not given express permission for you to transfer ownership.""<p>Since so many people like you are bitching about how buying software isn't actually ""buying"", it leads me to believe that most people already know this.

1712819,comment,1711171,1712152,0,0,cletus,,,"Wow... just wow.<p>Looking at something like that it's pretty easy to believe the premise of the documentary.<p>I have no experience with the US HS education system (or any part of the US education system for that matter) but two things strike me as odd:<p>1. How high school is <i>portrayed</i> in the media (film, TV, etc). It is portrayed as difficult but how does the syllabus compare to other countries? I've seen anecdotal evidence that maths, physics and chemistry that I learnt in HS (in Australia) aren't taught until college but this proves nothing; and<p>2. The GPA system. So many students seem to get GPAs of 3.8+ and an A is what? 90+? My experience with education was that marks that high were highly unusual (eg in a group of 80 you might get 2-5) and if you got 75 you were doing pretty well. My understanding is that the US education system relies heavily on scaling (bell curve) of marks. The UK does this too, leading to grade inflation (eg in the UK GCSE they now have an A* grade above an A because everyone was getting As). How does grade inflation compare between the US and elsewhere?<p>When I was living in the UK I saw a reality show where they subjected 16 year olds to the education system of the 50s including exams from that periods. Students that were getting 11 GCSEs As struggled to pass 4 of the old O-levels.<p>What particularly shocked me was students who had gotten an A in GCSE French couldn't conjugate the verb ""avoir"" (""to have"" in English). Oh and since grammar isn't really taught in English speaking countries is almost anachronistic, that means:<p>- I have: j'ai<p>- We have: nous avons<p>- Thou hast (deprecated): tu as<p>- You have: vous avez<p>- He/She/It has: il/elle a, c'est<p>- They have: ils/elles ont<p>(if memory serves)<p>It's times like this where the old Republican (conservative) philosophy makes sense: that education is a state not Federal issue (as it isn't specifically enumerated in the Constitution). The Federal Department of Education is just a much bigger bureaucracy. Sadly, that philosophy is now dead in the Bush (""No child gets ahead"")/neocon era.",1285081001

A few years ago, you could buy and sell multiple times and each time not lose money because of rising property values.  That time is gone, it may come back, but it may not.  In a more normal market, closing costs and Realtor fees take up most appreciation of a place and it may take 5+ years of paying your mortgage (and thus reducing your principle) to sell the place without taking a loss when you include those fees at selling time.  This is important if you are still young and have that itch to move around and find a place to call ""home"".<p>Yes there are a ton of other reasons why to buy a house and how to do it minimizing costs (which I am sure others will chime in with), but that one above is my favorite reason NOT to buy a house that I think everyone should think about.",1285080965

1712804,comment,1712493,1712640,0,0,ismarc,,,"I grew up poor, not ""oh, we're short on money"" poor, but ""people would randomly leave grocery bags with food in them during the holidays on our doorstep, of which some people stole food out of before we knew it was there"" poor.  It's hard to sum everything up properly in just a comment here on HN, it's not a lack of effort, or drive, or want to improve the situation.  It's literally everything in the deck completely stacked against you.  Get a $100 bonus?  Well, that means we can pay the past due on the electric and water bill both this month instead of paying only the one that is about to get shut off.  There's so much ground to make up that there is never any appearance of improvement, any and all progress results in ""less behind"" than you were before, but you're still behind and still have the same problems.  I started my own lawn mowing business when I was fairly young (~11-12) by borrowing someone's lawn mower, dragging it from section 8 housing to middle class neighborhoods and charging $20 a lawn.  I gave half of the money I made to my parents.  One of the things I bought from my portion of it was an 18 speed bike.  I eventually ended up getting hit by a car, and could afford to replace the rim of the wheel that got screwed up.  Eventually, my parents replaced the rim and gave the bike to my brother for Christmas.  Yes, they took my broken bike, spent less than $10 on a used, not-quite-right part and then gave it as a gift.<p>From all that I saw during this, I never once knew of a charity that provided any actual help.  Around the holidays, several different charities, churches and caring folks would drop off food.  But the food all had a shelf-life of less than a month, so we would eat really good for November/December and then immediately go back to how it was before.  I've worked for a few charities/non-profits since dragging myself out of that.  I wouldn't ever contribute a single dollar to a charity.  However, my time is worth far more value (to me and to those receiving it) than a dollar could be.  Volunteer regularly somewhere, like one Saturday a month.  The day given up is less cost than a corresponding day's worth of salary and the benefit you can provide is larger than the dollar amount.  In the past, I've provided efforts such as: plumbing/electrical/construction/maintenance at zero cost to the person receiving it (including replacement parts), child herding (three of us would take and pay for a trip to a local amusement park for the day, along the lines of a carnival in terms of rides), free tutoring (this one went a long ways, 2 kids and free ""babysitting"" all day, as well as providing a lot of benefit for the kids).  It is much easier to find people who are in need via religious organizations or shelters.<p>The key takeaway is that if you give dollars, it will be spent on what they absolutely need to survive.  There are no more decisions about sacrificing a little bit somewhere in order to do something ""nice"" such as fixing the leaking faucet because they just can't be made.  By providing the things that are sacrificed, you give a glimpse that things can be better while providing for what they cannot manage to.  I'm also of the opinion that it doesn't introduce a dependency on charity, which means that it would be better for them in the long term.",1285080829

Burcham was killed on 20 October 1944 while flying the third YP-80A produced, 44-83025. The “Gray Ghost” was lost on a test flight on 20 March 1945, although pilot Tony LeVier escaped. Newly promoted to chief engineering test pilot to replace Burcham, LeVier bailed out when one of the engine’s turbine blades broke, causing structural failure in the airplane’s tail. LeVier landed hard and broke his back, but returned to the test program after six months of recovery. Noted ace Major Richard Bong was also killed on an acceptance flight of a production P-80 in the United States on 6 August 1945. Both Burcham and Bong crashed as a result of main fuel pump failure. Burcham’s death was the result of a failure to brief him on a newly installed emergency fuel pump backup system, but the investigation of Bong’s crash found he had apparently forgotten to switch on the emergency fuel pump that could have prevented the accident. He bailed out when the aircraft rolled inverted but was too close to the ground for his parachute to deploy.</blockquote><p>So this “no bureaucracy” craze makes no sense for modern aviation design but makes a lot of sense where lives are not at risk (as is the case with a lot of software development, but not all).<p>That’s my $0.02.",1285079155

1. You probably didn't read the linked article. It was essentially a complaint that people don't own licensed software and that since licensed software interacts with hardware, when people violate the terms of the license they lose the use of the software and consequently the full use of the hardware that interacts with the software.
2. The analogy with hotel rooms is the core of the article's point of view. By using the hotel analogy it revealed the weakness in the article's complaint. The fact that you don't like it either means you agree that having a license doesn't mean that your own the thing, or, that you are making a separate point, that people don't understand what they are buying, but that is not the point of the linked article.",1285077614

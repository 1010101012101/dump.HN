The site doesn't have any focus. Its just polls on 'stuff'.  You <i>need</i> to have focus. You are a latecomer in a busy field that has negligible entry barriers, without focus you won't get any traction.<p>
The interface is slickly done, at least the login popup looks nice. But I know that I won't bother going past a login barrier to vote on polls about stuff that is trivial and not interesting to me (again, relates to lack of focus).<p>
What it comes down to is that the UI is nicely done, but that it doesn't matter if the UI is nice if it isn't something that people want to do in the first place.<p>
I don't think this idea is compelling. The implementation is strong, but I don't have any desire to use your site. I think the best investment you can make is to focus on a niche so that your site is somehow relevant to a group of people even if it is a small group, instead of irrelevant to everyone.",1183600411

Its best to have only one accessible url per destination.",1183599838

32519,comment,32517,32517,0,0,benhoyt,,,"URLs are case-sensitive, but on most sites they probably shouldn't be. For example, /users/Ben should work as well as /users/ben. This is true even if you have canonical links on your own site, because other sites may link them wrong, or a user will manually type in /users/Ben because he normally types his name capitalized.<p>Well, it's easy to just return the same page for /users/ben and /users/Ben, but is that the best thing to do? Or is a 301 redirect the better way? (So that users, including Google, never see the non-canonical URL.)<p>I notice reddit uses a 301 redirect for the likes of <a href=""http://reddit.com/user/BenHoyt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reddit.com/user/BenHoyt</a> -- but some other sites just show the page anyway, like <a href=""http://www.trademe.co.nz/ART/InDeX.HtM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.trademe.co.nz/ART/InDeX.HtM</a> -- and still other sites are simply case-sensitive: <a href=""http://images.google.com/ImageS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://images.google.com/ImageS</a>

At the first startup school, I asked almost every founder I could get my hands on: ""So, what would you do if you didn't have a co-founder?"").<p>If they get your application, and it says ""I am from India and can't leave"", then by their own rules that's broken, but there's no penalty for asking stupid questions. <p>How you react, as you come to realize that the question you are asking is a stupid one, probably says something relevant about a startup founder.",1183597721

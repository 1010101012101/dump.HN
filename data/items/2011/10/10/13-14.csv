3093762,comment,3092473,3092473,2,0,zobzu,,,"By reading the comments I figured the biggest issue with ""open source"" is that it is misunderstood, and terms are abused in various directions which have different meanings.<p>Generally people use FOSS (Free Open Source Software) as the term to coin the meaning: ""its open source, without compromises. It will never be closed, even for a while. AKA it's open source AND free as in freedom - yours - not the companies"".<p>Ends up in a BSD (pro for companies) vs GPL (pro for the users) fight usually. You'd think most would prefer GPL, but many of us actually work for companies and vote BSD (or similar) because it helps the hand that feed them. (I certainly vote GPL)<p>The GPLv3 added some more depth to the understanding of FOSS - it's been criticized, also by M. Torvalds, who's getting most contributions from people working for said companies.\nThe level of depth is simple: not only the software code must be available, possible to build and reproduce, but you must be able to do that on your device, that one which you own.<p>It's all about power and control. They want to control you. Eg, have Facebook installed and potentially running even if you don't use it. That's control.\nThat your warranty becomes void if you root the phone, that's for control too. They don't want <i>you</i> to be in control.\nThat's a good part of what FOSS is about: ensure that <i>you</i> stay in control. And that's also what simple OSS (Open Source Software) does not provide.<p>An I think that's important for our future, as software takes a big part of our lives.",1318255003

There are a good reasons why Google are proposing running Dart straight on their VM in Chrome. It will be faster, safer, easier to jit, easier to prove correct etc. Having a firm foundation would make it easier to innovate. Companies could still be encouraged to compete for faster and safer implementations.<p>The failure of Parrot to catch on has very little to do with the technology, nor the proposition of a general-purpose dynamic language VM. Parrot was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time (and it took too long to deliver). It also made the mistake of tying itself to an unfinished language spec. If they had concentrated on making a VM that could run Python, Ruby and Javascript they would have been in the right place at the right time when Perl 6 was finally ready to be implemented.<p>People are beginning to use Javascript and the V8 engine in a manner similar to the original Parrot proposal.<p>The time is right for a general-purpose IL so we can compile Coffeescript straight to the Javascript VM.<p>LLVM is being questioned by some because a) it isn't a VM it's <i>just</i> an IL so it is a compiler technology not a VM tech b) it is too low level to make the jitting of dynamic languages suitably efficient. LLVM is too low-level; Javascript is too high (and opinionated).<p>Judging innovation by precedence is always a bad idea.",1318254679

That's easy, if you split off a significant amount of your business to a second company then the company is worth less the exact amount you are splitting off. For example, $200 million company splits off $75 million of its company to a second company. Original company is now worth $125 million instantly.

The UI looks pretty cool, but it has to be usable. I think there's a search box too, as it popped up now and then. I'd try making that always visible for a bit and see what people think.<p>I think 5 is perhaps a latency issue, and because there's no feedback when things are happening it seems non-responsive For instance, if it's buffering a song ready for playing, a progress bar or even a spinning circle would be nice, rather than me clicking Play a few times because I'm not sure what's happening. Likewise, when I click a song to open up the ""Play or Download"" right menu, nothing tends to happen a lot of the time, and I'm not sure if it has ignored my clicks, or whether it's just doing it's thing and catching up (I suspect the latter). Ideally, if you can open up the right menu (the Play or Download one) as soon as I click a song, even if you then have to do loading stuff before play works it would seem more responsive. Just remember the user needs feedback to know something is happening.<p>Regarding download button, perhaps ""grey it out"" for now, and put a ""coming soon"" near it or something?<p>Anyway, these are nitpicks that are easily fixed, I think the app itself is a pretty awesome effort.",1318252118

I was wondering if they were offering any better content, but nope it's still the same B grade level junk I canceled the service two months ago for.<p>I know their content problem is not completely their fault, though if they offered higher priced plans I'm sure their content selection would improve.  Different price points should be offered from $8 to $25 or maybe $30.<p>Overall between these bi-polar business decisions and continual lack of good content I'm happily getting my content fix from other online outlets.  I was a huge fan a year ago but in the summer it started to lose it's appeal.",1318251602

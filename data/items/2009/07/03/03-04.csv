(Inline functions for extra speedup!  Forget standard math operators, lets twittle bits!  Business objects are for wimps, we'll stick everything in one String -> String hash table and compose the keys with inlined uncommented StringBuilder monstrosities!)",1246593517

It is true that this subverts the plain-meaning intention of the tax system (though I am skeptical that at least some of those ""loopholes"" aren't unintended at all) but it's not obviously unfair.",1246593308

So the motivation to jailbreak in order to tinker was somewhat justified. However with the release of the SDK and with so many apps out there at low prices, is there really still a need to jailbreak?<p>An iPhone developer can choose to either give his app away or sell it. Installing jailbreaking software annuls that choice effectively returning control to the consumer. Unfortunately a lot of people jailbreak to pirate apps and not to tinker.<p>As for the rest of your rant about Apple's greed. Consider that an iPhone developer chooses to make his app available for free. Apple makes no money out of it, yet has to supply hosting, bandwidth and other administrative costs. If free speech/beer is valued that highly to the developer, then write a web app since all half-way decent smartphones have browsers. No need to even pay the bozo tax aka iPhone developer fee.<p>When I'm on someone else's property, I behave according to the house rules.

685569,comment,685565,685565,0,0,carterschonwald,,,"This seems like an inverse of what you get when haskell's laziness is an advantage, namely that with haskell you defer computing stuff until its needed in a certain sense, whereas in this case, we're considering eager computations where whenever the code path for generating some data is purely functional in some sense, the runtime heuristically deletes the data and if it comes to be needed again, it gets once again computed.<p>This woudn't end well unless there was some way for the runtime/compiler to know the complexity of the computation.<p>On the other hand, this does remind me of work on what's called ""self-adjusting computation"" by several folks at uchicago and cmu, (<a href=""http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~umut/research/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~umut/research/</a>) which winds up being a really slick way of converting certain offline algorithms into online algorithms that in some cases have runtime complexity comparable or the same as the best known explicit online algorithms",1246592125

There are laws passed for specific corporations to reduce tax liability.<p>What's wrong with low density? There is a real economic value to variety and a minimum density to support certain kinds of commerce. You can't take this to a limit assuming there is no cost (if only opportunity cost) to moving to a less dense area.<p>Also, at least in the easy coast, the least dense areas are typically already state or national parks.

685564,comment,685441,685544,0,0,Locke1689,,,"I think it depends on the state -- certain states separate the taxes into Land Value Tax (LVT) and then actual ""property"" taxes, which is IIRC the improvement value of the building on the property. Both of these combined would be a real estate tax. I had assumed that they were taxing LVT, but the article is a little poor on details.<p><i>I think the issue is more that this isn't the case -- the 500,001st dollar is taxed at a much higher rate than the 35,001st dollar.</i>\nI can't quite tell if you are agreeing or disagreeing here. I was saying that the property tax is unfair in this case. There are many ways in which someone who has a high income could be taxed lower than someone with a lower income (which is what the progressive income tax is supposed to correct).",1246591580
685563,comment,685441,685543,0,0,jerf,,,"In order to really answer your question, we'd need to attach some numbers to the problem, since it's all a matter of which is cheaper.<p>However, every time I try, I find the concept of ""unimproved value of the land"" coming apart in my hands. There's really no way to separate the value of the item on the land from what is on the land. Oh, we do talk about lot values, but that's ultimately an abstraction that once it actually started to matter would be subject to gaming and interpretation.<p>It isn't really meaningful to talk about the economic value of something that doesn't exist. You can only determine the value of something by seeing what people will actually give up to obtain the item. When you ask about something that doesn't exist, you are asking people to estimate what they <i>might</i> be willing to give up if the thing actually existed, and people are notoriously bad at that.<p>(Note that the failure is ultimately human, not economic; a being that was more rational about being able to hypothesize what they would give up might not have this problem, but we have to go to government with the beings we have, not the beings we wish we had. This metric would start game-able and get worse.)<p>So I guess my answer is I can't seem to wrap my head around what's actually being proposed enough to elaborate on what my point was meaningfully. Consider this a strike against this summary of the proposal. (Whether it applies to the original I don't know, and I don't care enough to go check.)<p>(... actually, if you want to get <i>really</i> meta, the problem is that even if you waved a magic wand and had this implemented, Congress would still have it mangled inside two years flat. Congress is the real problem here, or government, or special interests, etc. The tax system is more effect than cause.)",1246591337

Just make sure you always have a reasonable level of health insurance coverage.  Otherwise, I can't think of any good reason not to do what you want.<p>At the very least, if you find you really <i>don't</i> enjoy it and that it isn't worth giving up two or three or four more years of your life to schooling, you'll put that nagging question of ""should I..."" to rest, and it'll only cost you a few grand and one semester.  I find that having those kinds of questions nagging at my mind is far more detrimental to my emotional well-being than the actual outcomes.",1246591155

One could argue that as an entertainment all in one hub, where the whole household buys casual games over the marketplace and watches TV shows and movies effortlessly, the xbox has failed.<p>This is the device Apple and Valve might be building. Not only are they going to try and streamline the software and UX of the whole thing to be in line with Apple's standards but I think they are also going to try to make it a replacement for cable tv.

I'll admit that I wish I had the freedom to build whatever I'd like, but I can assure you that jealousy has nothing to do with his wealth. Actually, the part of the article that quotes him I most agree with is how meaningless the numbers just changing in your bank account seem. Wealth is so far removed from value that it's kind of scary.<p>Phil Fish is an asshole, but I haven't read enough of his thinking on art, design and life to say whether he's a jerkoff or not.<p>Let me give you an example of what I'm talking about: ""He loathes watching sports, because they yield few tangible returns on the hours you invest in them.""<p>Now, I mean, I'm not someone who particularly enjoys sports, but if the article is paraphrasing him accurately, then that's such a boorish way of dismissing a hobby, especially from someone who is in entertainment. Some people like watching sport because they see the performance of the athletes as an art, the culmination of thousands of hours of effort played out upon a grand stage. Others see it as the drama between competing forces, with players and coaches as the actors in an improvised play. Some people just enjoy analyzing the tactics and strategy employed and attempting to know what the outcome would be. And the really weird people (in my opinion) just wanna crunch the numbers.<p>Personally, I just don't care for the rules of many sports and would rather be doing something less passive. I mean, I'm not gonna tell him that he should like sports, but that's such a strange way for him, in his position, to say that he doesn't like them. I watch lots and lots of movies. How many of them do I get anything out of after the film is over besides in-jokes? Vanishingly few. How much of the music that I listen to <i>really</i> makes me feel something? A handful of songs.<p>What he so out of hand dismisses in general is the umwelt of experience, the notion of being in the moment. Fully engaged. Blow doesn't seem to be happy with the idea that people like to be immersed. He wants to make people rationally grind through games, to never be in the moment, to always have their mind on and trying to analyze. He characterizes everything else as evil or wrong or garbage.<p>And then he goes and practices Tai Chi.",1334381992

What BaaS providers like us do is create generic apis to allow developers to do the common operations that already can do with their own server code. Everything that can be done with your own server code can be done with our server code. So if it's possible for you to write your own secure server, then it's possible for a BaaS to do the same.<p>The trick here is designing an API that is simple and easy to use that still works for a large set of use cases, and this is a very difficult task. Security is complicated, so making a generic, simple API tends to lead to APIs that apply to a reduced set of problems. Any particular BaaS system will likely not solve every security scenario available, but that doesn't mean ones can't be built that solve the vast majority of the scenarios that matter.<p>Firebase is working hard on building this API, and we're doing it with a lot of careful diligence and input from our users. We're nowhere near done with it, but we're confident that when we are, we'll have a simple, powerful security model that works well and is secure for most apps without needing any server code, and for those apps with more complicated needs, we make it easy to hook up your own servers too.|<p>Also, I'm very excited you got your app working in 5 minutes : )",1334380908

It won't matter if the opinion is right or wrong if social mores change, even if i changed with them, it's a reflection of who I was at that moment. But who we are changes moment to moment, day to day and year to year. What I am trying to get at is people, perhaps my great grandchildren or people I never meet and interact with will come across something I have written and never updated, or forgotten about entirely and then gone on about my day. Those people will need a tool to place that into a larger context or they will misunderstand how I got to the place I ended up. And I just want to be clearly understood, now and a hundred years from now.<p>What if social mores have drastically changed since that time and I have changed too? What if I am dead and gone, how do I let them know that as I evolved as a person going through life, my beliefs and my opinions have changed.<p>The tool that would let me do that is a tool I would love to have.

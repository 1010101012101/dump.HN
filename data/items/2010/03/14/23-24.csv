It's an imperfect world, I'm an imperfect person and we're going to make this thing work anyway, brother. YC or no YC. People still trade eyeballs and money for value, and single founder guys still come up with successful ways to trade that. A cofounder might be a critical success factor -- and you still might not have one. Guess what? Keep looking and keep moving forward. Waiting for a cofounder and not working on your plan is as stupid as getting a cofounder and waiting for the perfect plan. It's an imperfect world. We get judged on how well we deal with these imperfections and yet still make progress.",1268611092

1191584,comment,1191167,1191421,0,0,kalid,,,"Good question. I'm not an expert in functional programming but it's changed my mindset.<p>Imperative / functional languages are equally powerful, but are they equally expressive? There's a reason I wrote the above in a shell script vs. an OO-language (or C): shell scripting captures my intent with minimal overhead, with the right primitives built-in.<p>OO-languages force you to define classes, methods, type input parameters, etc. up front. So if you know you <i>just</i> want that exact workflow then you can model it.<p>What if I want to customize the sort routine? Well, I guess I can define a sorting interface and take that as an argument.<p>And what if I want a more flexible data structure? (With unix it's all text, but why not a hashmap being passed around?). Well, I can define a generic ""list"" class with an infinite number of members, and all the operations change this list.<p>But now we've gotten away from OO programming (saying data is of type ""List"" is not saying much at all).<p>We're basically trying to recreate functional programming ideas:<p>* Simple, flexible, built-in data structures (list of lists)<p>* Pass around functions at runtime, as you please (no interface to define, instantiate an object of that interface, and pass in)<p>* Composable functions (at runtime, decide that function Z is really F(G(x)))<p>It's not that the operations aren't possible, but OO languages seem to lead you down a specification-first path, usually customized to a problem domain.<p>You can ""get around"" this by using design patterns like Strategy, but again, you're recreating functional ideas in another language. Not that it's impossible, but it's not quite suited for the problem domain (like doing text processing in C vs. using perl... yes, you can find a regex lib, and a better string class, but why not use a language with it built in?).<p>Hope this helps -- different languages help you think differently. I've used C# a lot and really love the mix of functional and imperative styles in the latest versions (3.5).

I wouldn't try to sugar it up too much. Reality is a good teacher.<p>I used to be a freelance writer. You pitch people, they reject you. When asking girls out, you ask them, they reject you. If you're a salesman, you make friends and offer people help, they reject you.<p>Nothing wrong with being rejected. In fact, it should be a point of pride. Life is a numbers game. You have X rejections to get through to get where you are going. You got rejected. Now you have X-1. The faster you can crank the decrement loop the faster you'll reach your destination (assuming you are learning each time through the loop, of course!)",1268608702

Another alternative is to increase or decrease the number of successful applicants from 26 to something greater, like 30 or 35.  However, that would still leave a lot of 21 and 22 year olds, and almost no 23-33 year olds, which does not appear to be likely.  Therefore, the numbers don't make sense.  In other words, the only way these statistics make sense is if TechStars consisted entirely of students that are right out of college and thirty-four and thirty-five year olds.",1268608545

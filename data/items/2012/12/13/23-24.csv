4918836,comment,4918602,4918602,1,0,boboblong,,,"(Disclaimer: I have a ""bitcoin net worth"" of about 10 BTC.)<p>The first thing I thought of when I discovered Bitcoin was micropayments. I can understand the comparisons of Bitcoin to a pyramid scheme, but I don't think they're valid.<p>A better example would be the founders not of a company, but of a state. After Alexander swept through the middle east, his generals suddenly became extremely wealthy and powerful due to their positions as de facto rulers of successor states and their control of the silver mines of Macedonia. Note that both the precious metal and the authority of the generals were necessary components of a stable currency: the durability, divisibility, and malleability of silver made it a superior medium; but a silver coin not stamped as the general stamped his coins was considered counterfeit at worst and much less valuable at best (since the new government would not accept any but its own coins as payment). This was a necessary protection against the sudden inflation and arbitrary redistribution of wealth that could be caused by a gold or silver rush.<p>Much later, King Henry I of England perfected the use of tally sticks as currency. Without going into detail, his tally sticks were designed to prevent counterfeit and to minimize the trust between parties necessary to use the sticks as currency. Just like the idea of using one's military supremacy and control of a source of precious metals to convert military power to wealth and financial power, the tally sticks were essentially an information technology. The paper currencies of today's governments are the current state of the art in financial information technology.<p>This is why bitcoin is more like an upstart state than an upstart business. Businesses don't compete with state currencies. Throughout history, the power to mint one's own currency has been largely (but not totally) reserved to the rulers of states. What makes Bitcoin so interesting is that it's taken the historical requirements of a working currency and attempted to eliminate one requirement by doubling down on the other. Bitcoin has no political authority or military might to enforce its use in trade, but it does have a very innovative information technology foundation. The question is, can a currency survive on the latter alone?",1355442994

What matter is that we have way more APIs, all different, with inconsistent semantics and non-orthogonal feature sets than the non-web APIs of 15 years ago. On average the people designing these APIs are less competent than the people from 15 years ago creating more headaches for the people that <i>are</i> competent.<p>> Cloud VPS's at $0.02 per hour<p>Cloud virtualization is expensive, not cheap. It has its merits, the overhead for elasticity is much less than it used to be, but this matters only at scale. At small scale you get unpredictable performance and terrible I/O.<p>> 10 Gb ethernet<p>No such thing. Even on servers its rare. I had 1 GigE on my laptop 10 years ago. I can't get a better NIC on any laptop today. The world is actually worse than it used to be because back in the day I didn't need to worry about saturating Ethernet. Now I do.<p>> 54 Mb fiber in my house<p>I used to be able to buy a symmetric link with a fixed IP address and reverse DNS. Now fixed IP is a rarity, symmetric links are usually not available for non-business customers and when they are, they cost more than 15 years ago. Reverse DNS? Ha ha.<p>> multicore computers in everyones pocket<p>I don't need a multicore computer in my pocket. I need a phone with good signal and a battery that lasts. They don't make them anymore. Even if I need a computer, smartphones barely qualify. iOS is locked and Android requires me to do a type of programming I don't like. I'm used to computers that I can program the way I want, not being bound by some framework.<p>> GPS at everyones fingertips<p>I don't care. I never used a GPS, never needed one. What I've seen is that now people get lost when their GPS breaks. I view that as a failure of civilisation.<p>> web frameworks<p>I'd probably break some Hacker News scalability limit if I started writing about this one.<p>> caching solutions like Redis<p>Redis is required because the other pieces of the stack suck. It's a remedy, hardly a cure from an architectural point of view. The broad architectures around us are more unsuitable and more abused than they used to be.<p>It's actually worse than that. Unix and Plan 9 have thought us that's it is better to model behaviour through a single bounded interface rather than a growing set of specialised interfaces. This allows composition, protects against lock in, and allows synthetic components. Now there's a Redis API, there's a Cassandra API, there's a MongoDB API, there's a Zookeeper API, there's a Riak API, there's a RabbitMQ API. Everything has an API. A <i>different</i> API. Not only this destroys composability, it also hinders experimentation, increases the technical debt, makes the cost of transition higher, and bounds the writer into using a limited set of tools.<p>> data crunching pipelines like hadoop<p>Hadoop is a a player in an extremely niche field. I don't think it's relevant to talk about a thing as specific as hadoop in the context of something as general as the cultural and pragmatical shifts in the Internet. However, if you brought in the discussion, Hadoop is awful. Companies deploy it because it's trendy, not because they need it, introducing complexity, additional dependencies and a whole new set of problems to solve. Hadoop also dropped the bar on what is considered simple and sane deployment causing new software to be just as awful to deploy when they wouldn't really need to.<p>> payment processing like Dwolla<p>No idea what this is, but payments on the Internet are worse then they used to be. Sure, now you can buy anything, but it's harder to pay. Paypal periodically asks me for IDs and freezes my accounts just because I happen to move between two countries, there are many more types of cards, some work on the Internet better than others, some <i>banks</i> work on the Internet better than others. Merchants support only limited and disjoint set of payment options forcing me to have multiple types of credit cards and various types of accounts I don't want or care about. Back in the day, you had a credit card, it worked. Now I can buy groceries and shoes on the Internet. Back in the day I could not, but I didn't want to. I wanted to buy various types of equipement, and that I could.<p>> There will always be folks hankering for the glory days of alt.religion.kibology and compuserve.

4918807,comment,4918427,4918427,9,0,jamiequint,,,"This article is so specious. I am actually <i>shocked</i> that something this bad would come out of a company that purports to understand internet marketing and analytics.<p>First, its comparing two completely different types of retargeting. It compares one campaign where Facebook retargeting makes up 3/4 of the impressions to one that is just general retargeting on the ad exchanges. These perform completely differently.<p>Second, the timeframes are different. This makes a big difference especially if they have been running the same ads over a long period of time as ads (especially retargeted ads) tend to get ignored after a while so the falloff in performance can be quite rapid.<p>Third, comparing post-click conversion across retargeting partners doesn't really make much sense. You're targeting the audience to begin with, you should probably care mostly what percentage of your audience they are reaching and what the CPM is more than the CPA. Unless these guys are doing fancy stuff (e.g. more aggressively retargeting people who have clicked but then did not convert) it actually does not make any sense that CPA would be any different at scale.<p>Fourth, if you're running two different retargeting platforms on the same audience its possible that you're bidding up your own retargeting cost as the two platforms are bidding against each other. e.g. this shows a CTR of around 0.13% which is actually pretty good for FB retargeting, but they're paying ~$1 CPC which is really bad for FB retargeting.",1355442474

4918801,comment,4913224,4917451,2,0,InclinedPlane,,,"A lot of it comes down to the way NASA is organized. Generally it's big budget missions with a single spacecraft as the culmination of the mission. Rather than ongoing development programs. Also, NASA has this tendency to want to skip technology generations even though the end result tends to take longer to deliver and cost more than it would have if they would have just explored the intermediate technology space to start with (see: JWST and VentureStar). While we're talking about JWST, that's another big part of the way things are at NASA these days, that program has eaten most of the unmanned NASA budget and put a significant crimp on space science missions. It'll probably be worth it, but the cost is pretty extreme at this point. Also on the topic of JWST, I remember back when they were planning to have a flight demonstrator (Nexus) in the form of a Hubble class Earth-orbiting telescope using some of the NGST/JWST technology. Such a mission probably would have brought the risk of the JWST program more under control but for whatever reason they ended up cancelling it.<p>TPF is another example of planning farther ahead than is fully justified. As the program advanced the design became less and less fixed rather than more and more refined. This is an indication that they were designing something that was beyond their expertise and needed more intermediate research to figure out, but with the budget crunch and the lack of vision nobody could come up with good enough ideas to do so. NASA set their sights on deep nulling interferometry and it sounded like a really cool technology that might be capable of doing what they needed, but more and more it seems like that may not have been the best technology choice, and it led to a far too expensive system to fund.<p>If instead of JWST and SIM and TPF NASA had instead hitched it's wagon to a more incremental development approach, of launching Hubble or Kepler class telescopes in the $1 billion budget range every 2 or 3 years or so and using that program as a test bed for new technologies and new scientific investigations I think we'd be in a much better state right now and probably a lot closer toward having the capability to directly image exoplanets routinely. But who knows if that would have been the case.<p>On the plus side, the impending drop in the costs of orbital launch due to SpaceX et al will probably force NASA into a model such as that, so maybe we'll see if it generates better results.",1355442328

Thing is, <i>Flickr is still there and you can still use it</i>. What's clear from this is that Flickr didn't (and doesn't) cover what is the use case for most people: sharing photos with a limited group of friends and family.<p>Technorati? Honestly, I think this is an example of living inside a very small bubble. I'd honestly never heard of Technorati until long after it had waned.<p>I don't agree that the monetization of the Web has degraded the value (to the user) of links on sites other than links on sites aren't the primary discovery mechanism like they used to be, which is actually a good thing (IMHO).<p>> In the early part of this century, if you made a service that let users create or share content, the expectation was that they could easily download a full-fidelity copy of their data, or import that data into other competitive services, with no restrictions<p>This is only true to a limited extent IMHO. The primary services for creating information 10+ years ago were email providers. Because Web-based mail was a latecomer, services like Yahoo Mail and Hotmail grew up in an era where many people used Outlook, Thunderbird and other desktop email clients so they had to support POP3 (and later IMAP) and you could use those services to export your mail.<p>But that isn't the same as designing your services for interoperability. That was an unintended consequence.<p>As the idea of ""your mail, everywhere (you have an Internet connection)"" became dominant, so did Webmail. POP3/IMAP became less important.<p>Again, I consider this a net positive change.<p>> In the early days of the social web, there was a broad expectation that regular people might own their own identities by having their own websites<p>This I disagree with. Having your own domain and Website 10+ years ago was pretty unusual. Administering your own site is not easy, particularly as malware became more prevalent. This has declined because no one wants to run their own Website (or email server for that matter) because it's a crazy amount of effort for very little real gain.<p>The only real problem I see with the present state of the Web is that Facebook wants to own all your data. It wants to be your identity. It wants to be your Internet. That's bad. It's bad for the Web and bad for consumers. But honestly, I don't see it coming to pass. Facebook is just as susceptible to disruption as so many behemoths that have come (and gone) before it.<p>10+ years ago Microsoft dominated your computing environment. Many couldn't envision a future that would break free of this grasp. In a few short years Microsoft has diminished their control of your computing experience in ways few could've predicted.

That was years after this kind of thing was considered a problem, however, and it was somewhat <i>rightfully so</i>, and I believe the real story is that things actually got ""better"" as we came to understand these services more. I am not certain things actually got worse over the last ten years: in some ways they really got better.<p>Going back to 2002, Microsoft had been working on ""Hailstorm"", which was a very poorly chosen name for something that people rapidly became afraid of ;P. It was later renamed to ""My Services"", but it included Microsoft Passport (yes, this is mentioned in the article, but I don't think it is given enough weight), a single sign-on service provider that Microsoft was encouraging other websites to use. It would provide details about you, including your e-mail address, to the sites you connected with.<p>I had remembered a bunch of people being angry about it, so I did a Google search for ""Microsoft Password mark of the beast"", and came across an article written at the time in some random magazine called ""Microsoft's Passport to Controversy -- Depending on whom you ask, Passport is either a useful consumer convenience or the mark of the beast"".<p><a href=""http://business.highbeam.com/787/article-1G1-83378739/microsoft-passport-controversy-depending-whom-you-ask"" rel=""nofollow"">http://business.highbeam.com/787/article-1G1-83378739/micros...</a><p>However, it should be noted that one of the fears at the time was not ""man, vague centralization is bad"", it was ""omg, Microsoft doesn't just want this service to take over the web... they want this service to take over <i>the world</i>"". Now, of course, you read me saying that, and think ""ugh, stop with the rhetoric: that's just an example of people freaking out about something we find common-place; that's what the article is about: did you read it? ;P"".<p>But... it was actually for real. Microsoft was lobbying to make Microsoft Passport be the new US National ID system, and it wasn't just a pie-in-the-sky goal... they were lobbying to make it happen, had the ears of the right people, and were making serious progress on it. For reference, there was an article written about the situation in the Seattle Times with the title ""Feds might use Microsoft product for online ID"".<p>> Forget about a national ID card. Instead, the federal government might use Microsoft's Passport technology to verify the online identity of America's citizens, federal employees and businesses, according to the White House technology czar.<p>> On Sept. 30, the government plans to begin testing Web sites where businesses can pay taxes and citizens can learn about benefits and social services. It's also exploring how to verify the identity of users so the sites can share private information.<p><a href=""http://web-beta.archive.org/web/20020802161525/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/134438173_passport18.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web-beta.archive.org/web/20020802161525/http://seattl...</a><p>I thereby feel the need to note that, even as late as 2005, if you were going to start talking about building the world's next best ""single sign-on"" provider, this is what you were being mentally compared with: yes, the one service mentioned (TypeKey) ended up having ""much more restrictive terms of service about sharing data"", but it is looking at the past through rose-colored glasses to think that things have gone downhill.<p>Let's put it this way: can you seriously imagine Facebook or Twitter ever being considered as the official login system for the IRS? I can't in 2012, but that was the honest-to-goodness reality of ""the web we lost"" from 10 years ago. At some point, in the last 10 years, it became more, not less, clear to everyone that this kind of service needed limits. There was backlash in 2002; but I believe it was much more fringe-concern than it would be now in 2012.<p>> Yesterday, appearing at the conference, Gates reiterated the goal, saying he expects governments in many countries will find it difficult getting to ""critical mass"" with authentication systems they develop on their own. He said some governments may opt to use companies such as Microsoft or America Online as ""the bank"" that registers people for online usage.",1355441354

Thirty years later, China has gone from an economic disaster to being the second largest economy in the world, and despite its burgeoning size, it is still growing rapidly today.  In the process, literally hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of abject poverty, and the Chinese people are hopeful of the future again.<p>It was not the government that did this; it was globalization, it was capitalism, it was the desire to make a profit.

4918682,comment,4918038,4918618,3,0,mjn,,,"<i>Litigation is, by design, the way to challenge most government action.</i><p>This is a big difference, and is even used <i>within</i> government, for example when a state sues the federal government to challenge a law. For Constitutional things that is true in any country with a federalist system, since if a state/province argues the national government overstepped its authority, some kind of constitutional court needs to resolve the dispute. But the U.S. uses it even in statutory disputes. Congress will pass a fairly general law, delegate enforcement to bodies such as the EPA, and then you have years of litigation between the EPA, a state, and maybe even a municipality, over things such as new transit systems. In many other countries, even large ones, this is done more centrally. For example, if Paris decides to build a new line on the Paris metro, it will present a proposal to the national legislature, which will (if it agrees) pass a law specifically authorizing the construction of that line. After that happens, the line expansion becomes <i>definitionally</i> legal: the national parliament has passed a law authorizing it, which supersedes any previous laws, except for the constitution itself. So there is no grounds for anyone to sue to block the line on the basis of other laws (environmental laws, noise ordinances, etc.), since the legislature is presumed to have already weighed all those factors in passing the law authorizing the metro expansion. The U.S. Congress instead prefers to pass general guidelines and leave it up to the courts to decide whether a particular metro line follows those guidelines or not.",1355440550

Precisely because of methods such as this one where someone might memorize or learn a bunch of patterns to common puzzles going around. They come in and ace the interview test.  Does it really tell you anything about the person other than they can train themselves like an intelligent monkey to produce the correct output given an input?<p>My preference, by far, is to spend time discussing ideas and approaches to solving problems.  I don't want to see code.  I want to see into his/her brain.  How do you think?  How do you slice and dice a problem to try to get to core?  How good are you at intuitively choosing a good data representation?  Do you bring-up alternative approaches to optimize for size vs. raw speed or other parameters?  What questions do you ask?<p>Anyhow, whether the person can actually write two lines of code or not can be ascertained by looking at prior work (if available).  The most interesting aspects of a programmer  --the real reasons you might not want to let him(her) get away-- have nothing whatsoever to do with how quickly they can write a bunch of loops or if they have memorized five sorting algorithms.  Nah, the real value is in how they think.  That's what you want to hire them for.<p>EDIT: Some of the best, most creative and versatile programmers I have known could not write code without a set of reference books next to them.  Why?  Because they don't have encyclopedic knowledge of the various languages they might use.  They'd excel at dissecting data to reveal structure and representation and then choosing a good approach to solve the problem but more often than not had to have a library of various CS and language books around them to support their work.

Not sure, though.

That scenario would happen if there currently exist students who didn't have good enough grades to make it into a UC, but whose parents would have paid cash out of pocket to attend, if their sons/daughters were able to get in. Those potential customers/students who are willing and able to pay, but are currently being turned away, might pick up the opened slots, if any materialized. I don't know how many such students exist, though.<p>Another approach could have been for the UC system to lower enrollment on its side, so they could educate fewer students at lower tuition, given the same amount of state funding.

4918631,comment,4916629,4916629,32,0,DigitalSea,,,"This story hits close to my heart. I lost my mother a little over a year ago due to chronic alcoholism. She had been drinking for years, battled post-natal depression and one day we convinced her she was really sick and needed to go to the hospital. Her liver was in the process of shutting down, she was so dehydrated and malnourished her veins had shrunk making it difficult for doctors to take blood or put in drips. I remember the day that she went to hospital I forced her to go to the doctors and every test they ran came back red, her cardiogram yielded a weakened heart rhythm and it was at that point she realised she needed to go to the hospital, little did we know it was too late to help her.<p>The doctors were shocked at the state she was in. He offered to call an ambulance, but my mother wanted to be driven to the hospital instead. I knew she would try and talk her way out of it by refusing an ambulance, but finally convinced her there was no way she wasn't going. She was obviously scared and we all told her that going to hospital meant she'd get better and she probably wouldn't be in there very long, I didn't expect she would be dying in hospital two days later.<p>As soon as she was admitted she went straight into the emergency ward. She was under watch 24/7, hooked up to machines that monitored everything. She was still very much with it, just not as energetic. She could hold a conversation, she just looked aged but wasn't delirious or anything. We thought she was going to get better, she was in emergency for one day before being moved to a ward where she wasn't being monitored as carefully. I think it was a mistake moving her to a ward so soon.<p>She never told anyone she was scared or needed help. Apparently she would call my dads sister and cry to her when everyone was asleep saying she was afraid of dying. My dads sister tried to take her to the doctors repeatedly, but I think knowing something was wrong and being scared stopped her from wanting to go to the doctors until it was too late.<p>She was on 4 saline drips (one in each wrist and one in each knee) to try and hydrate her body. I still remember seeing her lying there with 4 drips, I didn't even know they could do that. She started showing signs of recovery, was more level-headed, but tired and lethargic. She actually seemed like she was getting better, her pulse was getting stronger and the hydration she was getting was helping her, and then at 3am one morning after being in the hospital for 2 days we all got a call that she went into cardiac arrest and they tried to resuscitate her for 1 hour before giving up.<p>I often wonder if she would have lived longer if she didn't go to hospital. Part of me thinks that her body couldn't handle four drips pumping saline into her body 2 days straight constantly, she had a weak pulse and the fact her veins had shrunken to me thinks she should have stayed in the emergency ward for a couple more days.<p>She left behind her son (me) and 5 daughters one of which only just turned 8 years old. It's made my dad incredibly strong, I've never seen him cry before. I still remember that day vividly, he's had his fair share of alcohol related problems and has been battling depression and a nervous disorder his entire life due to being abused as a child but I think he's stayed strong for us. I am worried that one day a switch might flip in his head and he'll have a breakdown, but I don't really want to think of that.<p>I know how you feel Notch, you never quite get over losing a parent. I partially blame myself for my mothers death. She had a drinking problem for years and I did nothing. She was obviously in decline and although everyone tried to get her to go to the doctors, she wouldn't. Did we try hard enough?<p>Thanks for sharing your story Notch, I think there are many who have lost a parent due to an alcohol incident like yourself. It's hard to tell people you lost a parent to alcohol, let alone talk about losing a parent in such a horrible way.<p>People say drugs like marijuana are bad, alcohol is the worse of them all.<p>My mother was 48 years old.",1355439838

I think the situation is that they find themselves a couple years out of college and still unable to put their BAs in a Humanities field (another area for which supply has greatly outpaced demand) to use.  So they're already saddled with a debt they can't really service, and they've already got the B word in their heads.  And along comes a really attractive proposition:  If you double down on it by going back to school, you catch an immediate break because you get to immediately stop paying your student loans, and wont have to start again until after you've graduated.  And sure, after that you'll have even more debt, but there's also a decent (maybe not great, but decent) chance that your new degree will let you land a sweet job that lets you pay them off much more easily and have plenty of money to spare.  And even if you only land an OK job, hopefully it'll still be enough to keep your loans covered. . . and if it isn't, hey, no harm no foul.  You're already thinking about the B word right now, so even if it turns out you can't handle all the new debt you've taken on it's not like you'll be any worse off than you are now.<p>Posed that way, I'm not sure what the students are doing is terribly irrational or delusional.  What's crazy is the irrational credit system that enables/encourages this kind of thing to happen.",1355439688

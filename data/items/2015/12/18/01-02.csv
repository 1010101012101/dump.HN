They&#x27;ll be dedicating several years of their lives to this workplace and will be looking at the interview filter to see what it takes to get in.&quot;<p>Really? I barely know anyone who works for several years at any place. I&#x27;m looking at whether I can tolerate it for six months. That&#x27;s only so I can take a job search break for a few months before hitting the grind again. I&#x27;d love to work at a place that&#x27;s so great that I&#x27;d be there for several years but that&#x27;s hard to imagine. Most companies I&#x27;ve interviewed with don&#x27;t exist in 3 years, let alone &#x27;several&#x27; (7+).",1450403997

Nostradamus in a hoody.<p>Read this sentence:<p>&quot;It looks quite difficult to design a seed AI such that its preferences, if fully implemented, would be consistent with the survival of humans and the things we care about,&quot; Bostrom told Dylan Matthews, a reporter at Vox.<p>Notice the mixture of pseudo-technical terms like “seed AI” and “fully implemented”, alongisde logical contructs such as “consistent with” --  all leading up to the phobic beacons radiating at the finale: “the survival of humans and the things we care about.”<p>It&#x27;s interesting, the technical challenges that he feels optimism and pessimism for. For reasons best known to himself, Bostrom has chosen to be optimistic that we can solve AI (some of the best researchers are not, and they are <i>very</i> conservative about the present state of research). It may perhaps the hardest problem in computer science. But he&#x27;s pessimistic that we&#x27;ll make it friendly.<p>Bostrom’s tower is great for monologs. The parlor game of AI fearmongering has entertained, rattled and flattered a lot of people in Silicon Valley, because it is about us. It elevates one of our core, collective projects to apocalyptic status. But there is no dialog to enter, no opponent to grapple with, because no one can deny Bostrom&#x27;s pronouncements any more than he can prove them.<p><i>Superintelligence</i> is like one of those books on chess strategy that walk you through one gambit after the other. Bostrom, too, walks us through gambits; for example, what are the possible consequences of developing hardware that allows us to upload or emulate a brain? Hint: It would make AI much easier, or in Bostrom’s words, reduce “recalcitrance.”<p>But unlike the gambits of chess, which assume fixed rules and pieces, Bostrom’s gambits imagine new pieces and rules at each step, substituting dragons for knights and supersonic albatrosses for rooks, so that we are forced to consider the pros and cons of decreasingly likely scenarios painted brightly at the end of a line of mights and coulds. In science fiction, this can be intriguing; in a work of supposed non-fiction, it is tiresome.<p>How can you possibly respond to someone positing a supersonic albatross? Maybe Bostrom thinks it will have two eyes, while I say three, and that might make all the difference, a few more speculative steps into the gambit.<p>In the New Yorker article The Doomsday Invention, Bostrom noted that he was &quot;learning how to code.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/23/doomsday-invention-artificial-intelligence-nick-bostrom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/23/doomsday-invent...</a><p>We might have expected him to do that before he wrote a book about AI.

I can download some open-source code and run it on my laptop - but Google has data centres with 10s or 100s of thousands of computers.  The big corporations are much more likely to have/control the advanced AI because they have the resources for the needed hardware.<p>* Soft / hard takeoff - \nI think a lot of people miss that any &#x27;hard takeoffs&#x27; will be limited by the amount of hardware that can be allocated to an AI.\nLet us imagine that we have created an AI that can reach human level intelligence, and it requires a data centre with 10000 computers to run it.  Just because the AI has reached human level intelligence doesn&#x27;t mean that the AI will magically get smarter and smarter and become &#x27;unto a God&#x27; to us.  If it wants to get 2x smarter, it will probably require 2x (or more) computers.  The exact ratio depends on the equation of &#x27;achieved intelligence&#x27; vs hardware requirements, and also on the unknown factor of algorithmic improvements.  I think that algorithmic improvements will have diminishing returns.  Even if the AI is able to improve its own algorithms by say 2x, it&#x27;s unlikely that will allow it to transition from human level to &#x27;god-level&#x27; AI.  I think hardware resources allocated will still be the major factor.\nSo an AI isn&#x27;t likely to get a lot smarter in a subtle, hidden way, or in an explosive way.  More likely it will be something like &#x27;we spent another 100M dollars on our new data centre, and now the AI is 50% smarter!&#x27;.",1450403278

Most job interviews will have questions about them (though the job itself may not actually use the latest tech).<p>- Be sharp, concise and confident in job interviews. I&#x27;ve heard from my co-workers who do the interviews for new candidates. They find resumes good, but they fail candidates because they were terrible at interviews.<p>- Up the ante. Take up higher positions. You probably make a good project manager with that 10 years around people.",1450403216

You need to take the long game approach to building an audience (Basecamp took awhile to build up its audience which eventually propelled its product which still took awhile and never became a &#x27;unicorn&#x27;). Going to where your customers are is a grind. You just keep talking though and eventually you find a ton of value from those conversations. Inkling (YC W06!) was a long grind. Never turned into a unicorn. Never got rich. But... all the hard work eventually led to us figuring out how to make a living from it. Same with Cityposh from YC S11. That was a total bust. But eventually, after a ton of pain and even had to take a break and do the Obama campaign tech team, figured out some value that turned into Draft (<a href=""http://draftin.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://draftin.com</a>) which tada also hasn&#x27;t made me rich. But it makes some decent revenue for a thing that runs on its own and took one person to build and maintain.<p>A lot of grinding and figuring this stuff out and doing stuff I mention in this article kept getting me further and further and further.

There&#x27;s usually always a way to make some money from something we think we&#x27;re passionate about. It&#x27;s probably not plan A, B, C, D, or E. But eventually we can figure out an angle.

It&#x27;s this type, not `uint`, that should be used by functions like `str.find()` and `re.match()`. This makes it a compile error to, say, slice a string with an index to another string. Internally, or course, all indices are represented as `uint`s, but your program has no business knowing this. It&#x27;s an abstract type. IMO, this solution is particularly useful for systems languages, where the increased flexibility and fine-grained control are worth the increase in complexity.<p>(1) Coalgebras: `str.find()` shouldn&#x27;t return an index. Instead, it should return in O(1) time, and allocating O(1) additional space, the left and right slices of the original string, split at the desired index. (If the string can be split in multiple places, `str.find()` should return an iterator whose element type is such left-right pairs.) For this to work, it&#x27;s fundamental that the left and right slices not be allocated in their own buffers, but instead share the original string&#x27;s buffer. IMO, this solution is best for high-level languages, where simplifying the API is well worth a little loss in flexibility.<p>Neither of these APIs allows the programmer to split strings at the wrong places.",1450400725

It&#x27;s not having access to a software&#x27;s _original_ sources that you can build and deploy yourself that is the problem.  Ideally, there would be some nuclear-powered version of View Source that gave you nice access to the original sources for the code loaded on a page - sort of a formalized &quot;Fork Me on GitHub&quot;.<p>When I am being philosophical, smoking a cigar and sipping tequila after midnight, I begin to understand that the only software I&#x27;ve written that has a chance of outliving me is my open source.  Everything else I&#x27;ve done has just been to serve up fleeting amusements.  There is literally nothing commercially closed that I have contributed to that shouldn&#x27;t be utterly scrapped.<p>If I died tonight, my positive impact on this planet for its people now and in the future is probably just constrained to my kids surviving me.  Not an inconsequential thing, I love my kids like crazy and they&#x27;re going on to do greater things than me.  I just have the sense I&#x27;ve got more to offer than procreation and raising good people.<p>In my opinion, any hairy audacious moonshot goals humanity chooses to tackle should be open sourced in every way possible - otherwise the efforts cannot be fully genuine and transparent to generations that follow.  Perhaps the increased open-sourcing of code and designs we see from industry today versus 20 years ago is the best we can hope for in competitive capitalist societies; maybe what we have is good and is the most we can expect.",1450400467

Was he interacting with Facebook using his synack.com email address <i>during this exchange</i> rather than at some point in the past?  Was he signed up on Facebook with his synack.com address?  (I haven&#x27;t used the bug bounty program but it appears to require a user account.)  Did he mention his employment with Synack in the course of the exchange?  If any of those things were true, I suspect they&#x27;d say so, rather than leaving it at &quot;has interacted...&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know, if the guy was just shaking them down then maybe trying to get him fired is indeed a reasonable thing to do, but I don&#x27;t buy that anyone would have just assumed under the circumstances that he was doing all of this on the clock.",1450400464

They’ve developed a Firefox setup profile called JonDoBrowser that’s optimized for their own test. While the HTTP headers JonDoBrowser sends to sites can be easily distinguished from those of other browsers (though they’ve attempted to standardize HTTP headers within their own ecosystem), their proxying service compensates for that by withholding all traceable details and eliminating all forms of local storage, thus providing better privacy.<p>They’re located in Germany—a big legal plus—and their service uses an international chain of independent servers, but they charge for data rates greater than a few hundred kilobits per second. Thankfully, the browser profile also supports faster Tor proxying while maintaining the same degree of personal privacy. It also supports anything you can configure from your computer’s settings, but if that means something other than Tor or JonDo, it’s probably not redundant (i.e., comprising multiple independent proxy servers) and therefore less reliable.

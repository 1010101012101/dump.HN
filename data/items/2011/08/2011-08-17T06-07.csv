By then it was way too late.<p>The account auto-suspension may have been a bit harsh. But what they never should have done was explain it in public.

That way you take that stuff offline as soon as possible before it has a chance to foment into something nasty. And if it's really something private, there's nothing more you <i>can</i> say.<p>That aside, the tone in that blog post is all wrong. In paragraph one, ""our side of the fence"" draws lines and creates an adversarial tone right from the start. It's clear throughout that the author is taking this personally.<p>Paragraph two is mostly fine, but ends on a self-righteous semi-parenthetical, ""We don't, for the record."" As if they're going out of their way to be better than everyone else.<p>From paragraph three, the airing of dirty laundry begins. Beyond this, deleting 8090% of the post would likely add to its value.<p>In paragraph five there's even some kind of victim mentality going on. They're being ""baited"" on Twitter, and ""[attacked] for reasons unknown."" The analysis is starting to get tedious.<p>All throughout, the message being communicated is: We did nothing wrong. It's defensive, and what facts are present play a secondary role to the message. Better to be proactive about the facts, leave out anything that hints of defensiveness, and just take your lumps.<p>Any time you're saying ""what I <i>intended,""</i> you've already lost.<p>But, again, a better blog post would not have needed to be written in the first place.",1313563142

Sitting at a desk for 8+ hours tends to cause various posture problems through shortening and chronic contraction of some muscle groups (e.g. hip flexors) and weakening of others (e. g. glutes). Especially cycling strikes me as a bizarre recommendation, I would say 2 hours of cycling has the same effect on posture as 8 additional hours of sitting at the desk. The recommendation to do bench presses is a great way to further round ones already rounded (from all the sitting at the keyboard) shoulders. Swimming is great, but not everyone has warm weather all year long or likes swimming pools.

Possibly shutter unprofitable product lines like feature phones entirely, and focus the company on things Google considers strategic for them, i.e. Android phones and set top boxes.<p>Admittedly, Blodget is right that Google has no experience in performing this kind of maneuver, so there are a lot of risks, but considering that they bought a patent portfolio that happened to come with a company attached, there's no real reason to be afraid of downsizing the company to a point where Motorola can turn a decent profit and start growing again.<p>Or, as Blodget points out, they could just spin the company off as soon as they can and wash their hands of the whole thing.",1313562149

Not sure yet if better or worse than my previous macbook's non-chiclet keyboard.<p>- the power-to-weight ratio is great - but it's not the lightest notebook, so if you don't need all that much power but need to carry it with you a lot, you'd probably be served better by a macbook air or zenbook prime.<p>- I need an optical drive surprisingly often, so I got the external usb superdrive. Also, needing to carry extra cables to get ethernet or more than 2 usb ports is annoying<p>So far I'm really happy with it, especially the retina screen is something that I really enjoy, and that you can't get with any other manufacturer or model.<p>Is it worth the money? For me, yes, since I use my computer a lot, and tend to keep it for many years. But you could probably get a computer that's 80% as good for half the price...",1364374498

My claim is it would be difficult or impossible to do this in their format.<p>* The implementation doesn't work (dialog pops up when you try to post a comment, and ""okay"" doesn't work).<p>* UX is unclear (I couldn't figure out how to start a debate after minutes of trying, or how to search in useful ways, etc.).<p>* System isn't open source/free software.

Otherwise, you may have the full power of Lisp at your fingertips, but you'll need to have your entire team used to this workflow and knowledgeable of Lisp, and by having logic in templates and such you're dangerously close to leaning towards the ""PHP way"".<p>...the only realistic ""homogenous"" solution for one language on the server and the client are the Javascript based way, in the Node ecosystem. Good designers or good front-end guys in general will also have coding skills, some will be Javascript gurus, but by doing things this way and writing Javascript code in Parenscript/Clojure script you'll have to force them to learn Lisp in order to work at 100%.

The downside is the integrated graphics can seem borderline for driving the display at times. Some apps have issues. Fullscreen flash video is choppy in Chrome though works fine from both FF and Safari. The fans are dead quiet at low RPM, so if you run on integrated graphics with low cpu use (editing text, web browsing w/o flash heavy sites) you will hear nothing. On dedicated graphics and moderate cpu (flash video), it gets warm/hot and you'll hear the fans, but it is not bad. At high cpu use system can be really loud. I think I'm going to return it and wait for the next rev.<p>PS. I also have a 2008 MacBook Pro. It was running hot and loud until I blew it out good with a can of compressed air.

When are people going to cry fowl that Apple is abusing the patent system by trying to patent something as obvious as multi-touch?  Microsoft was demoing this technology years ago.<p>Just because Apple is filing a patent does not mean that it is about to be introduced into the market.",1219982344

289786,comment,289526,289526,0,0,mdasen,,,"Bandwidth is a limited resource.  It costs money to produce therefore it has to cost you money to use.  Cable/DSL/FiOS connections are sold with the assumption that they are fractional connections (in the way that a timeshare entitles you to fractional use).  The nice thing is that packet-switching makes that sharing really easy and generally efficient.<p>However, when someone uses more than just fractional use, it affects both the provider and other users.  Let's take that 250GB cap.  That's 2,000Gb (gigabits) per month, 66Gb/day, 2.7Gb/hour, 47Mb/minute, 809Kbps.  So, in order to hit Comcast's limit, you must be using more than half a T1 connection 24/7 without interruption.<p>Does that seem unfair?  If you're using more than half a T1, maybe you shouldn't be using a shared connection such as cable/DSL/FiOS?  T1s are expensive because they aren't shared.  Cable/DSL/FiOS is cheap because it is shared.  If you can't share, the economics that make it cheap just aren't there and logic/reality dictate that it just doesn't work.<p>Comcast's 250GB limit isn't exactly low and really only hits people who should really have a more dedicated connection.  Also, remember that heavy users place an impetus on providers not to increase bandwidth speeds because they don't have the capacity from their CO to the wider internet.  If you're one of the few who can saturate half a T1, you have a huge incentive to be against bandwidth caps.  If you're everyone else, they'll probably affect you in a positive way (as long as they are set high like 250GB/mo).<p>And to be fair to people who are completely against this, I am a little worried that American companies might go the way of certain foreign ones with 50GB-ish caps, but as long as their criteria remains using more than 50% of a T1, I say good for them!",1219982301

289768,comment,289487,289655,0,0,tricky,,,"(heavily adapted/paraphrased/quoted from 28 Feb 2006 Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Letter by Warren E. Buffett)<p>The explanation begins with a fundamental truth: With unimportant exceptions, such as foreclosures (in which some of a seller's losses are borne by creditors) the most that a real estate investor, in aggregate, can earn between now and Judgment Day is what the market, in aggregate, earns.<p>True, by buying and selling clever or lucky, investor A may take more than his share of the pie at the expense of investor B. And, yes, all investors feel richer when prices soar. But an owner can exit only by having someone take his place. If one investor sells high, another must buy high. For owners as a whole, there is simply no magic-- no shower of money from outer space-- that will enable them to extract wealth from their homes beyond that created by the markets themselves.<p>Indeed, owners must earn less than their markets earn because of ""frictional"" costs. And that's my point: These costs are now being incurred in amounts that will cause homeowners to earn far less than they historically have.",1219980655

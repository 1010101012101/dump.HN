7321350,comment,7318922,7320890,1,0,mindslight,,,"I took a quick look through that site, paging through my alma mater of a decade ago. I do see pathologies in the ratings/comments that remind me of complaints I would hear about professors from fellow students that were stressed, not getting the material, or used to a more structured environment. And if these ratings held weight with the university, I can definitely see professors dumbing down their lessons to avoid bad reviews. So I do see what you&#x27;re getting at with it going terribly wrong.<p>Still, I think there&#x27;s several key differences:<p>1. Every school student would be rating their teachers, rather than just those that loved a professor, had an axe to grind, or were encouraged to by an entertaining personality.<p>2. The context would be &quot;closed&quot;, with each teacher relative to their school, rather than open cross-institution competition with a front page of featured &quot;rockstar&quot; professors that make the rest seem inadequate.<p>3. The high schools officially sanctioning ratings with real results would give kids the feeling that they really do have a stake in the process, rather than simply being its victims.<p>4. High school is a more structured environment where the process details matter a lot more. So a teacher eg giving out an incomplete homework problem is actually a valid indictment rather than the stressed out nitpicking of a culture shocked freshman.<p>5. In college, there&#x27;s a certain level of appreciation for the material that everyone should have but doesn&#x27;t necessarily, causing them to get frustrated at a professor with a dry personality. Whereas with high school, the idea is that everybody should be learning a cursory understanding of all subjects.<p>6. In college, there&#x27;s a huge variation in the level of courses. One specific professor I had for a seminar where it was basically his PhD research group and me, an undergrad who&#x27;d just started on a simultaneous master&#x27;s. I learned <i>a lot</i> in that class, and really appreciated him. I then ended up in a grad-level &quot;intro&quot; course with him (which I knew was an utter waste going in, but it was the only thing that fit my schedule). Most of the students were rote-memorization paying-for-credential types, but his style certainly did them no favors either, and I can definitely see my recollection echoed in a few of his current reviews. I&#x27;d say that he&#x27;s still a teaching asset, but not for intro lectures where most students aren&#x27;t already committed to the subject.<p>Really, there just needs to be <i>some</i> extrinsic motivation/reward for teachers that are truly making a difference versus simply clock-punching, and that&#x27;s not more top-down testing edicts that further shackle them. And sure, the immediate reaction shouldn&#x27;t be to fire the lowest-reviewed, but neither should we pretend that they deserve similar compensation to the exceptional ones.",1393620201

Let&#x27;s make a comparison with medicine. Medicine isn&#x27;t just doctors and clinics, there are scientists working behind the scenes to produce new research-based cures that have been validated as well as explained in scientific studies. Doctors who go off the ranch in medicine are censured or arrested because medical research is a science and clinical practice is fully backed up by solid, empirical evidence.<p>Psychology has clinics and practitioners, but what takes place there is not remotely scientific and is sometimes astonishingly ignorant (<a href=""http://arachnoid.com/trouble_with_psychology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/trouble_with_psychology</a>), and there are no cures, only questionable symptomatic treatments. The reason? Unlike medicine, psychology has no scientific component to prevent absolutely any practice in clinics.<p>My point? Many argue that psychology isn&#x27;t just clinical psychology, that there are scientific psychologists working behind the scenes. My response is to ask why this fact, these psychological scientists, have had no effect on psychological clinical practice, as is true in medicine? The answer is obvious -- psychology describes, it cannot explain, and science requires empirical, testable explanations, for reasons given here:<p><a href=""http://arachnoid.com/building_science"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/building_science</a><p>But don&#x27;t take my word for it -- NIMH chairman Thomas Insel has recently come to the same conclusion, recently ruling that the DSM may no longer be used as the basis for scientific research proposals, for the simple reason that it has no scientific content.<p><a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-diagnosis.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-dia...</a>",1393619370

What this means is that even within infinite data, you can&#x27;t prove that the other structures are impossible.

The article tries to paint all teachers with the same brush, which when you get to know teachers you realize is absolutely ludicrous.<p>No system is going to perfect the way teaching works, and it&#x27;s obvious why when you look at the teachers themselves. They have wildly varying educational background, cultural background, social skills. Different motivations. Different methods. Of course some schools are better than others, because a variety of factors based on region and executive management changes the way students and teachers are sourced, to say nothing of prescribed curriculum and funded school resources.<p>So when people talk about schools, or teachers, or education in general in the USA like it&#x27;s one big blob, I know it&#x27;s a huge crock of shit. It&#x27;s highly variable all over the country and even within the same local region.<p>The one thing that is fairly consistent, though, is the passion of the teachers. Most of them teach because <i>they really want to teach</i>. But there are myriad roadblocks to providing kids a good education - and that&#x27;s in the cases where kids are open to actually learning.

As an embedded designer, I eagerly thought about these types of devices 15 years ago.<p>The problem is that we, the technical community, got hoodwinked away from open protocols into thinking that closed systems based on dumping data to someone else&#x27;s server is an acceptable basis for much of anything. Manufacturers are quite happy to foist these proprietary solutions on us because it lets them create lock in, differentiate on superficial features, keep hiding sloppy development, and derive licensing fees for any third parties that think they can help analyze your data (with your consent, or not). The &quot;average&quot; user sees no difference because it&#x27;s all magic boxen to them, and we&#x27;ve done them a great disservice by shirking our <i>professional duty</i> and being &quot;yes men&quot; for this backwards environment.<p>My rejection doesn&#x27;t come from &quot;fear&quot; of &quot;risks&quot; - it comes from the rational assessment that once this data is out there, especially in such collated form, you&#x27;ve lost control of how it is used against your interests. The only way to brush that off as &quot;fear&quot; is to say the future where cloud-big-brother knows more about me than I do is inevitable. So rather than being scared, I should learn to love the rats on my face. I am <i>hoping</i> this is wrong.<p>Furthermore, reliance upon any technology makes it de facto mandatory which becomes much harder to extricate yourself from to switch to something with a less hostile architecture. Especially as more open architectures will be less polished due to less funding as creating freedom isn&#x27;t lucrative.<p>And it&#x27;s <i>not just the NSA</i> - there&#x27;s the much larger and better poised threat from the commercial side as well, via insurance / background check companies. How long until &quot;I have to do 500 more steps today so I don&#x27;t have to pay $50 extra on my health insurance&quot; ?<p>(PS Never mind getting on the upgrade treadmill for fixtures who&#x27;s lifetime has traditionally been decades, just for software bugfixes and upgrades.

8445421,comment,8444785,8444785,0,0,q2,,,"Reading of such articles makes me wonder about the reports/ranks given by transparency international ...etc on corruption. Comment by @icantthinkofone in this thread indicates this problem can be seen in other organizations too. If that is true, then corruption is there across all public organizations in US. In India too, we hear stories of corruption but scale is different. I conclude, it is explicit in some sectors/countries and implicit/polished/organized in other sectors/countries i.e. indices such as corruption,human life quality are just instruments to point out at emerging countries and show them in negative shades while pushing similar issues in developed countries silently under carpet and showing them in positive shades (at least during preparation of ranks). After consistent media focus, damage will be done and countries will be forever labeled as negative and leaders,future generations will forever live in that pseudo bubble thinking that they are inferior/corrupt ...etc to developed ones. (Many Indians think America/Europe is heaven with no issues like drought/crime...etc).<p>I included human life quality because as long as systems are working, west including Europe and America appear good(seeing from very far) but once in a while catastrophe occurs(due to nature or man-made), then we will see ugly side (e.g: looting during katrina[1], London riots[2], riots in sweden[3] ...etc) as if that ugly side is suppressed under the weight of systems/rules rather than genuine intrinsic goodness of people living there[4].<p>My intention is not to show any one in bad light but to give the conclusion or correct the myth that just because a country is materially wealthy i.e. developed, does not mean that there will be no daily issues. If emerging countries like BRICS understand that, then they pursue all round development rather than blindly becoming photo copies of west in pursuit of material wealth and harming themselves like pollution in china[5].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/id/9131493/ns/us_news-katrina_the_long_road_back/t/looters-take-advantage-new-orleans-mess/#.UI73ZMVG-Nw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nbcnews.com/id/9131493/ns/us_news-katrina_the_lon...</a>\n[2]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_England_riots"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_England_riots</a>\n[3]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Stockholm_riots"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Stockholm_riots</a>\n[4]<a href=""http://caffertyfile.blogs.cnn.com/2011/03/15/why-is-there-no-looting-in-japan/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caffertyfile.blogs.cnn.com/2011/03/15/why-is-there-no...</a>\n[5]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution_in_China"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution_in_China</a>",1413125650

8445390,comment,8444976,8445090,0,0,Cowicide,,,"Is this the &quot;big one&quot;?<p>As in a widespread, prevalent, worldwide pandemic that also affects the United States in a widespread manner?  Dead people in the streets in the USA?  It doesn&#x27;t appear that way to me because ebola doesn&#x27;t appear to be incredibly easy to transmit compared to other &quot;big one&quot; infectious diseases humanity has dealt with in the past.<p>For example, if it was vastly contagious, I&#x27;d think someone in Thomas Eric Duncan&#x27;s extended family would have caught it.  Out of all those exposed, none of them caught it including his fiancé.<p>And this was a guy apparently sent home from the hospital showing symptoms with a 103 degree temperature, etc. - witnesses also said he was vomiting profusely &quot;all over the place&quot; (even outdoors in front of his housing complex).<p>No doubt this is a serious, devastating issue and may very well affect millions in developing countries if no improvement in intervention and community behavior occurs.  Properly educating health care providers and the public is paramount.  I also think it&#x27;s likely to spread somewhat in the USA, but not anywhere near compared to developing countries.<p>I think it&#x27;s overhyped in the media and that&#x27;s good - and bad.  The good is the overhype will lead to more media exposure and perhaps preventative measures being demanded by the public to better prevent the spread.<p>Reminds me a little of the Y2K bug.  There was a media hyped freakout over it, so a lot of people became aware of the issue, took precautions/actions and prevented the worst case scenarios from happening.  New Years Day for 2000 went mostly without a hitch for the general public.  The &quot;overhype&quot; in that case worked in our favor to some extent and prodded people to take action due to so much media exposure.<p>However, the bad from the CNN-esque overhype in this particular case is that irrational fear may very well get in the way of proper responses and cause ebola to spread more widely in developing countries than it would with a more balanced and less hysterical approach.  So, I do think the overhype may very well be a double-edged sword in that regard.<p>I&#x27;m somewhat surprised, but not shocked, that a health care worker caught it from Duncan in Texas even while (apparently) wearing protection, etc. - but I also have a feeling some protocol, somewhere was missed.  I would hope it&#x27;s all on hospital surveillance video and people are checking the footage very carefully to see if they can spot any lapses in said protocols.  If they aren&#x27;t using comprehensive surveillance of people working with ebola in American hospitals - then they really need to start, in my opinion.<p>I&#x27;ve seen plenty of nurses in American hospitals go from room to room tracking potential contaminants on the bottoms of their shoes because they often don&#x27;t wear disposable booties.  Meanwhile, they inevitably drop items on the potentially contaminated floors and often don&#x27;t replace or even just clean the items.  Especially those pulse oximeters that easily fall off fingers onto the floor and also have cords that often touch the floor as well and end up being touched one way or another afterwards without being cleaned/replaced.  There&#x27;s also an issue where nurses and doctors simply don&#x27;t wash their hands enough.<p>After witnessing this, I&#x27;m not shocked someone caught ebola in that Texas hospital.  Like I said, I strongly suspect some protocol was missed even if the administrators initially claim all protocols were properly followed.<p>In my opinion, this is a very serious issue and our hospitals have needed a wake-up call for a long time to better prevent transmission of infectious diseases in hospitals.  But, I&#x27;m not seeing this leading to a &quot;big one&quot; within the USA.  If anything, I think it may be beneficial in finally getting more American hospitals to finally clean up their act and help to prevent less scary infectious diseases down the road.<p>Good breakdown and comparisons with other contagious diseases here:<p><a href=""http://www.webmd.com/news/20140806/ebola-virus-how-contagious"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webmd.com/news/20140806/ebola-virus-how-contagiou...</a>",1413124764

First off I have to say that IBS is not even remotely comparable to IBD.  For most people, IBS is a very inconvenient life-altering syndrome.  IBD is often 100x worse, increases the risks of colon cancer and can be life threatening.  I wouldn&#x27;t wish ulcerative colitis or Crohn&#x27;s disease (IBD) on my worst enemy.<p>Beyond that, I&#x27;m not sure why you think this pill would help your IBS.  It is specifically meant to treat one particular problem - a clostridium difficile infection.  Typically the colon is populated by helpful or otherwise non-harmful bacteria.  Clostridium difficile is an opportunistic infection that often takes hold after someone takes a course of antibiotics that kills all the helpful bacteria.  The fecal transplant puts back the normal bacteria into your colon, attempting to crowd out the clostridium difficile bacteria.  There is anecdotal evidence of fecal transplants helping IBS or IBD but it has not been studied well.

I haven&#x27;t had symptoms of IBS for over 12 years now since doing that.  Unfortunately I find I have to eat about 40 grams of dietary fiber and drink about a gallon and a half of water per day.  That takes actual work, but it&#x27;s worth it.

It doesn&#x27;t make any sense!<p>Any right-thinking programmer should care about inconsistencies such as this. If I&#x27;m evaluating a programming language, and I see someone in its community writing their own language implementation to support an application that could&#x27;ve easily been written using one of the standard language implementations, then it looks to me like the standard implementations aren&#x27;t mature enough or trustworthy enough for me to use for my application. Not only that, but it suggests that maybe this particular language isn&#x27;t as good as its advocates claim, especially if I have to drop back down to C in order to meet certain requirements (e.g., portability, speed, wider understanding, etc.).<p>But any right-thinking programmer already knows that lisp is not worth wasting any time on. It&#x27;s dead, and people like Kaz, and projects like TXR, are going to make sure it stays that way.",1413123162

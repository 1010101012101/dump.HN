But based on all the Asians I've ever met in the US, it's a pretty clear yes.<p>The US is the most progressive nation in the world in terms of promoting ideals of racial and gender equality, which naturally results in more people believing in ""genetic equality"" as well. As such, I'd be very surprised if there were another nation/culture that downplayed the genetic influence on intelligence/aptitude as much as in the US, where people are taught that anyone can do anything if they want it badly enough.

In fact, he says that, no, Muni owns the data in question and that the public is, of course, entitled to access it.""<p>I paste this here, because it's at the very bottom of the article and it doesn't seem obvious to me that the arrival time of buses is public data that can be used for free. Well, that's what most of us wish but if Nextbus had made a deal with Muni to put their transponders on the buses in exchange of owning the data and giving it to Muni for free, it would be hard to argue otherwise. I wouldn't be surprised if Muni actually got a special deal because I think I remember looking at this exact thing for the buses where I live and that it had to be licensed.<p>It's somewhat similar to satellite or map imaging, in that companies have invested money to gather the data. It is public data in one sense but that doesn't necessarily mean it can be used freely. I'm glad Muni spoke out and made it clear though.<p>Another example (of a similar kind of possible deal) would be JCDecaux which offered (I believe) bus-stops benches to cities in exchange of managing the advertising on them.",1245989430

674930,comment,673726,674159,0,0,jwecker,,,"I did an uberman polyphasic schedule for a year and everyman for about 6 months.  Stage N1 is likely an adjustment period where your body rhythms slow down and things get ready.  Studies have shown that stage N2 and N3 (deep cycles) are essential for healing and muscle growth- they are also when HGH hormones are released.  REM has shown to be essential for memory retention and some studies have linked lack of REM to schizophrenia and other psychosis.<p>When I was polyphasic, roughly 70% of my polynaps were REM and 30% were deep cycles.  Interestingly, if I was sore from a workout or something, it would continue to be sore until I had a deep cycle.<p>Despite the vast, vast multitude of sleep studies (and departments, and journals) out there, I've only seen one study on polyphasic sleep and it was very exploratory.  People who study sleep at all immediately associate it with sleep deprivation, which has been studied so much all they can do is spew forth the negatives (there are tons) associated with it.  The premise of functional polyphasic sleep is that the body actually adjust so there is no sleep deprivation.<p>I didn't end up blogging about it, and I don't write about it much, because frankly, after doing it for a month or so- when I was really well adjusted- I ceased having something to prove.  It kind of feels like talking about my bowel movements or something.  I guess it could be vaguely interesting to someone, but it bores the crap out of me (forgive me).<p>So quickly:  I would not recommend it.  You can't exercise much, the adjustment period is very, very difficult (only 10 days, but that's 6 naps a day == like getting up way earlier than you wanted to 60 times in a row.  Most people can't even get up earlier than they want to once in a row.)  You need an environment where you can have all the lights on and make all the noise you want all night.  You can't have other people imposing meetings or any kind of schedule on you.  You can't do anything that takes longer than 4 hours.  And here's the real kicker: you can't work for more than ~50 hours a week without getting burned out!  Yeah, having more hours doesn't help that.  And don't even think of starting it if you have something remotely stressful coming up or not enough to do.  And don't think of starting it if you live somewhere where it's cold at night.  Etc.<p>All the debate over the health effects are meaningless- it's people who haven't experienced it or frankly studied it.  Sleep deprivation only applies in the first 10 days.  After that it feels far less harmful then, say, caffeine.  <i>shrug</i><p>EDIT:  Hypothesis (in case someone actually wants to _study_ it- I sure couldn't find any takers when I was doing it):  The body seemed to eliminate N1 altogether- my heartrate and body temperature would drop within 30 seconds of lying down- for over a year.  2nd part of the hypothesis- the the first one or two REM cycles at night are essential and the rest is padding built in by evolution to keep you asleep until dawn.  3rd part- other body functions relying on the circadian rhythm adapt- especially digestion, which is _totally_ different when fully adjusted to polyphasic sleep.  4th- there is a reservoir of... something... built up for when you get injured or sick by having that extra sleep in monophasic sleep.<p>Also, I stopped because I got lazy.<p>Finally, if you get colds easy, don't even try.  A single cold will wipe you out for a day or more.",1245989190

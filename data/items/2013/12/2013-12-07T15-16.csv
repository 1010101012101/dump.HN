The scripting language lets you do so many interesting things with it (escrow, wills, and surely lots of things I can&#x27;t envision).<p>Check out this video about bitcoin contracts which talks about the scripting language: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=mD4L7xDNCmA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=mD4L...</a><p>Unfortunately, if I understand correctly, non-standard transactions are not accepted by most miners currently, which means the interesting things in the previously linked contracts video wouldn&#x27;t work. This should improve over time as new transactions are proposed and added to the list of standard transactions. The bitcointalk forums, while having a lot of noise, also has interesting discussions about new transaction types.<p>Bitcoin combined with its scripting language is just too good of an idea to go away, and I think we&#x27;ll start to see more interesting transactions within a couple years.<p>edit: Forgot to mention that everyone who is manic about bitcoin never even mentions the good ideas in the actual protocol, they only focus on the crazy price swings. Learning about the backing technology is the best way to feel confident about bitcoin&#x27;s future.",1386431890

The 808 certainly didn&#x27;t sound like actual drums. And the people buying them weren&#x27;t classically trained musicians: they were dudes who liked the music and wanted to try it themselves.<p>There&#x27;s a documentary I really like on the history of House music called &quot;Pump Up The Volume,&quot; and it can actually be found entirely on Youtube: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1HpY65cXDA\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1HpY65cXDA</a> -- it covers what some of the early genre originators were doing and feeling at the time. Generally they were just experimenting, as well as doing the &quot;track -> venue/club -> evaluate&quot; feedback loop so common in the origin of genres. However, I still think it&#x27;s cool to hear them discuss their unique contributions to a style that would eventually grow far larger than they ever expected.<p>There are also some good books on the history of electronic music I can recommend, the best one being &quot;Last Night A DJ Saved My Life&quot; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Last-Night-DJ-Saved-Life/dp/0802146104/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/Last-Night-DJ-Saved-Life/dp/0802146104...</a>",1386431635

So far, the best way to reduce &quot;risk&quot; in concurrent systems is to constrain side effects, and not share mutable state between units of concurrency.<p>If you&#x27;re choosing to reduce the number of side effects, then a functional language is clearly the best suited for the job. The creators of Erlang knew this.  The creators of Haskell discovered(?) this.<p>In my opinion, the fact that Clojure is a lisp is completely irrelevant, personally I prefer ML-family syntax, but the consistent standard library of Clojure makes it too powerful to ignore.<p>The focus on concurrent programming is also indicated by its relaxed stance of side effects.  It is not a pure language, it only sets the constraint that you cant have side effects that leak state into other units of concurrency.

But we didn&#x27;t, we saw 20-30% reductions in spending on nonresidential equipment and software.[1][2] Declines in purchases of non-labor productive capital were far steeper than reductions labor (they&#x27;re just harder to see for the average person).<p>It wasn&#x27;t labor vs. equipment this time, the decline in labor was mostly driven by the decline in consumption.<p>I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s strong consensus to explain the decline in consumption. One theory is that the decline in consumption happened primarily because households woke up one morning and realized that they were broke from years of credit card debt and housing investment [3], but there are a million other theories.<p>On the whole though, I don&#x27;t think you find better worker conditions in agricultural societies.

Now I’m back to school for my third year of studies and I don’t have the hardware and the time to continue to work on.<p>My main motivation to write this was to help people saving time when doing repetitive tasks. I worked in the telco. department of a big company and I realized that although people were really good at designing and maintaining networks they were wasting time on some basics tasks. So I wrote this little “framework” to make mass configuration changes on Cisco devices.\nFor example, I used it to remove useless crypto PKI on hundreds of switches, and to rename thousands of devices to lowercase (and regenerating the SSH key).<p>I am not a good programmer but looking back at my code five month later I thought it was worth sharing it, if never some people are interested in it :)",1386429279

6866539,comment,6866310,6866456,8,0,dariusk,,,"Hi, author of the site here. Spelunky was made using GameMaker 8, and I ported it to GameMaker Studio and used its HTML5 exporter to get it working in Chrome, then I modded the core game from there for this tool.<p>So: the reason it&#x27;s constantly redrawn is because GameMaker redraws the whole screen.<p>But also, it&#x27;s important to note that GameMaker is meant to be general purpose game engine. Dirty rectangles work great if you&#x27;re building very specific kinds of games where only small portions of the screen are updating at any time. For a game like Spelunky, which is a platformer where the whole screen moves (aka there&#x27;s fast &quot;camera&quot; motion), it doesn&#x27;t provide very large performance boosts at all. I don&#x27;t work on GM so I can only guess but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s a combination of a super-legacy engine (GM is 15 years old and hasn&#x27;t had a complete rewrite ever) as well as a need to be as flexible as possible.",1386429215

4222497,comment,4222072,4222370,4,0,simonh,,,"Apple's real motto isn't think different, it's ""think it through"". The android handset manufacturers have tried every combination of sizes, technologies, features (3D, mini projectors, built in laser pointers), etc and left it to the buyer to find out if they were a good idea or not. Apple, for better or worse, does the work up front to decide what are the optimum combinations of sizes, shapes, technologies and features and aims its products at the sweet spots.<p>I have a friend who says he won't buy a tablet until they come out in full A4 size. I think he'll be waiting for years to come, and if one does come out it'll be from a company that made a tablet that size because it's a good size for paper, not because it's a good size for a tablet computer. I don't think that company will be Apple.",1341903572

While this isn't then ""best of breed"" behavior, I don't think it is unreasonable behavior.

There are tons of things in JavaScript (and virtually every other language, if not all of them) that are bad design; the fact that parseInt takes a string as its first argument and that 1/0 is the string ""Infinity"" really doesn't seem like it should qualify.<p>The fact that we are looking at parseInt as a potential problem here doesn't even make sense, given that the way most developers at this point actually expect functions like parseInt to work is to stop at the first non-number, and the developer in this case specifically went out of their way to choose a radix where I is a number.<p>Things that could have happened instead:<p>1) parseInt could fail if it is passed a string that contains anything that is not a digit (this would surprise many developers: again, this is highly common behavior)<p>2) 1/0 could throw an exception (I would argue this isn't even useful: +Inf is a valuable result)<p>3) +Inf could return something other than Infinity if converted to a string (maybe the infinity symbol in unicode?)<p>4) +Inf could refuse to be converted to a string (this is awkward, given that any other number can be converted to a string)<p>5) numbers could always refuse to be automatically converted to strings (I actually agree with this, but I feel like I'm in the minority: 'a' + 4 + 'b' would therefore also hopefully be illegal; this is an argument for a separate string concatenation operator)<p>6) parseInt could specifically refuse to automatically convert its argument to a string (this is probably the most reasonable thing that could have been different; however, tons of languages, including ones considered to have amazing type systems like Scala, support implicit conversion and don't even offer this kind of override flexibity)<p>Which are you claiming is the bad design? Maybe there's something I'm missing? I mean, if this was a situation where 4 + '1a' yielded the result '5' I'd be sufficiently angry as to claim that the people who designed this language were incompetent or dangerously negligant (PHP probably does this...

Typing ""video"" will also get me my video players.<p>I find this to be a nice feature. I am a developer but don't have the time to tinker with every little on my desktop. For me, and with the newest version of unity, it works well enough to let me get on with my work.",1341900217

I got used to checking my watch even when I have a cell phone on me, especially when talking to people. Having a watch on is a lot more functional than this article made it seem, though yeah, it still is mainly for looks.",1341900213
4222351,comment,4222236,4222236,5,0,michaelpinto,,,"Yes.<p>And I'll add something to that: When you become a fortysomething if you hit a down cycle and don't have a degree it can become a real dead end. Of course this isn't to say that having a degree is some sort of ""magic get a job card"", but when you get a certain age just having a high school degree isn't that great.<p>Lastly: I use to assume that the above assumption might have exceptions in the world of tech, but for example if you try to get a job at a place at Google not only do they want to know your degree, not only do you have to have killer grades  but they'll even go a step further and make you dig up your SAT scores!<p>So do yourself a favor: Get a degree while you're still young.",1341900180

Steve Jobs wasn't lying and playing you for chumps, it was apparently a wonderful gift that he could change his mind from one day to the next. And all the Apple faithful will vehemently spit the old gospel at you until the new pronouncement comes down from on-high and then they will all immediately change their tune. Just last week we were getting rabid comments on HN about how awful the idea of a 7-inch tablet is. We've always been at war with Eastasia.",1341900045

Its not about reward for having a degree or for contributions made, it's just economics.  If you create extra profits through very hard work, the company will gladly take those and hand them over to the equity holders for you so they can buy a new car or whatever (thanks).",1341900029

Can&#x27;t say the same about the stock market.</i><p>Yes, you absolutely can say the same about the stock market.  In fact, the historical compound annual growth rate of the market, adjusted for inflation, is almost 7%.  That&#x27;s over 100+ years.  I don&#x27;t have the data in front of me, but I&#x27;ll bet the market returns crush real estate returns over that period.<p>You&#x27;ll have to explain how these people managed to accumulate such wealth &quot;quickly&quot; through real estate, unless it involved flipping houses during one of the biggest housing bubbles in economic history, of which there were massive amounts of losers on the other end of these transactions (aka <i>bagholders</i>).  This era produced a ton of &quot;real estate gurus&quot;, but it will prove to be an anomalous period.  But, taking the economic environment in context , it <i>was</i> a great, clever way to make a fortune; akin to telling someone to sell Tulips in 1640.  I just think the idea that &quot;buy real estate, get rich&quot; is naive.  The real trick is figuring out the next real estate, or Tulip, early in the cycle.<p>TINSTAAFL.  There is nothing magical about expected real estate returns, and they are in line with any other investment vehicle when adjusted for risk.",1395766485

So you end up half-assedly writing your own, or just using spaghetti code.<p>There are plenty available, just not one dominant one.<p>> I&#x27;m tempted to suggest that Python doesn&#x27;t have these frameworks because it doesn&#x27;t bother to support writing large programs.<p>That probably approximate the truth, in that the brittle &quot;large program&quot; architectural style that IoC/DI approaches seek to mitigate the harms of is probably less popular for large systems where Python is used (or at least the Python parts) which favor smaller <i>programs</i> interacting through standardized communication protocols for constructing large systems.<p>> Likewise with testing, there&#x27;s the unittest module but it&#x27;s not really integrated with a build system or anything else.<p>Since there is no &quot;build&quot; with python, the fact that its unittest module is not integrated with a build system isn&#x27;t surprising. There are plenty of tools that support integrating unittest (or other python testing frameworks) in workflows, including utilities that do testing on every file save (similar to autotest in Ruby). Obviously, in the absence of a build step, they aren&#x27;t integrated into a build system, but the workflows are often <i>better</i> because of the absence of a build step.",1395766454

They are specifically agreeing amongst themselves to <i>not</i> target certain people in violation of normal competitive practices in the relevant market, while continuing the practices with regard to others outside the conspiracy.<p>Much of the time, the distinction between a lawful practice and an unlawful practice is whether two or more companies got together and agreed to engage in the practice.

7467016,comment,7466351,7466765,9,0,thinkpad20,,,"There are a lot of concepts that need to be learned first before monads become simple; namely, functional programming (in general, including the lambda calculus, currying and function composition), and Haskell&#x27;s type system and how type classes work. All of this stuff needs to be understood at a fairly intuitive level. Add to this that the way much monadic code is often used, and the `do` syntax that supports it, can mislead newcomers into trying to understand monadic code as similar to imperative code. Add also that many of the most common monads, like the State monad, have clever monadic instances involving passing functions around which are beautiful but hardly intuitive to understand. Add further that many monads used in practice are monad <i>transformers</i>, increasing the complexity and opacity further and making production code hard to grok for beginners.<p>So there are many legitimate reasons why monads are a hard concept. That said, I completely agree that the best way to learn them is to actually try to use them. In fact, I think that the main reason monad tutorials are seen as useless is not because they&#x27;re poorly written, but because no tutorial can teach you monads a fraction as well as you will learn them by actually using them.",1395766300

In some cases my blog posts have literally taking man weeks to create because they are based on efforts for customers. The code, data, and experience end up getting written down then at some point I might spend 10 minutes to a few hours writing a blog post. Some of those very same blog posts, that have consumed massive amounts of time, have been more or less ignored. Some have ended up being very popular. So what I would say is ignore your average investment time and focus on your goals. What are you goals for blogging? Is it just expressing yourself, communicating to others, sharing your hard won experience,  driving a brand (maybe brand you), or just storing information for latter retrieval. Depending on what your goal you will find that you time investments will be very different.  For example if you’re really want to show the world how deep your understanding of certain technologies are you might need to spend significant time writing rich and deep content. If your just sharing news articles of interest with a brief bit of insight maybe just 10 minutes a day.",1395766056

In Java it&#x27;s incredibly verbose to express & manipulate something like &quot;a list of pairs of sets of integers&quot; because if that was part of your core data model, you&#x27;d want to represent it in a class, and then you have all sorts of problems about what callers expect vs. what they get (e.g., do I get a reference to the original, or a copy?  Can I safely mutate this?).<p>But if you actually have facilities to pass around and manipulate those kinds of data structures in a way with no side effects, it&#x27;s trivial to verify (first on the REPL, then in your unit tests) that whatever transformation you&#x27;re writing applies properly down the entire nested chain, and it will always work for anything of that pattern.

The fact is that you do not have to &quot;understand&quot; monads in order to write practical programs that use the IO monad or even something more complicated like Parsec. I&#x27;ve seen too many people stop using Haskell when it&#x27;s time to start doing something that isn&#x27;t purely functional because they have been afraid of going to unfamiliar territory.<p>Here&#x27;s a simple two part exercise that should give you enough of an understanding about the basics of using IO and give you a general idea about monads.<p><pre><code>    1. Write a &quot;guess the number&quot; game\n    2. Write it without &quot;do&quot; notation, using (>>=)\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s it. If you&#x27;re at all like me, this should give you a better start than reading theory about the subject. Now that you have a basic understanding about the practice, it&#x27;s easier to grok the theory.<p>And even if you do not understand the theoretical aspects of it by now, you know enough IO to be able to read and write files, connect to the internet using sockets or do some HTTP requests.

And I phrased it as &quot;one of the very few bits of relatively solid software engineering&quot; on purpose... that phrase isn&#x27;t really high praise. You can quibble all day about the precise details, not least of which is the age of the studies in question.<p>Still, I do stick by my original point... if you think lines of code are <i>irrelevent</i>, it becomes very difficult to understand the current landscape of language popularity. A language in which simply reading a line from a file is a multi-dozen line travesty is harder to use than a language in which it&#x27;s two or three, and that extends on through the rest of the language. I know when I go from a language where certain patterns are easy into a higher B&D language where the right thing is a lot more work, I have to fight the urge to not do the lot-more-work, and this higher level &quot;how expensive is it to use the <i>correct</i> pattern?&quot; is a far more important, if harder to describe, consideration across non-trivial code bases.",1395765926

Whole avenues of research are cut off as verboten.<p>Furthermore what you are stating is your personal opinion that a sense of revulsion and disgust is not a valid source of moral opinions.  But now you&#x27;re opening another can of worms.  Preliminary results from brain research have identified 5 different subsystems in our brain that underly opinions that get called &quot;moral&quot;.  Those 5 systems are:<p>1. Recognition of suffering in others.<p>2. Reciprocity (the golden rule).<p>3. Hierarchy (respect for elders, power systems, etc).<p>4. Coalitionary bonding (loyalty to your group, patriotism, etc).<p>5. Purity (praising cleanliness, viewing things as gross).<p>In general liberal moral systems tend to focus on the first 2 and conservative moral systems tend to focus on the last 3.  As much as you think that revulsion and disgust are not proper bases for moral opinions, most of the world disagrees with you.

This assures that the &quot;power&quot; stays within the people that actually work in the company.<p>- This also means that 2/3 of the partners must be employed with a contract and a salary. This can be quite difficult when you build the company as you must, technically, start paying yourself and your partner (since you must be 2 partners minimum) on day 1.<p>- You need a minimum of 2 partners, but can also have as many employees as you want. This means you can technically be a co-op even if your company has 2 partners and 1000 employees.<p>- There are rules as to how you distribute your benefits : a maximum of 33% can be distributed as dividends to the partners, a minimum of 16% must be kept in the company for investment (reserves), and a minimum of 33% has to be distributed amongst all employees (following a calculation the employees can decide upon, like according to time worked, salaries, how long one&#x27;s been in the company, or a custom calculation...). This tends to lead to high employee motivation and better ensure long-term health.<p>- Co-operatives have a few tax deductions that other companies don&#x27;t. If you don&#x27;t distribute any dividends and distribute it all to your employees + keep some for investments, and follow a certain number of other rules, you can practically be exempted of taxes on the company&#x27;s benefits.<p>- On the other hand, you must go through a bunch of red tape to prove every year that you follow the rules of a co-operative, which costs time and a bit of money.<p>We built the company 2 years ago, and right now we&#x27;re only 3 partner/employees so our day-to-day life is basically the same as any other similar-sized company, but we liked the philosophy, and it has actually been an interesting marketing feature.",1395763968

Bankers and smaller credit unions argue, I believe reasonably, that increasing commercial portfolios by CUs would create an unfair playing field (the bankers&#x27; argument) and increase CU accountholders&#x27; risks (the smaller CUs, which generally aren&#x27;t going for large commercial portfolios and see this as a way for the largest CUs to reduce the smaller competition).<p>Lending restrictions on CUs work well -- post-2008, credit unions were considerably more stable than commercial banks, with the exception of CUs that took on outsized commercial portfolios. For example, Texans Credit Union had a waiver that allowed up to 20% of its portfolio to be commercial (and then bought a subsidiary that had billions of dollars in CRE loans that didn&#x27;t count towards its cap). Even before the crash, its bad debt ate up a majority of its equity, and consumed the rest in the 2008 meltdown. As a result, the board and executive leadership were summarily canned in 2011, after three years of steady deterioration, and the NCUA took over running the institution.",1395763897

If it does not it rejects the email. Otherwise it encrypts your email and sends it to the receivers’ email accounts.</i><p>This makes it sound like a user can only send email to recipients whose GPG keys they have. If this is the case, this is a huge red flag; the past two decades of encrypted email usage has proved conclusively that the huge majority of users do not care about privacy. If as a kinko user I have to get GPG keys for all my friends, this will never take off.<p>I&#x27;d strongly recommend encrypting where possible, but allowing unencrypted copies to be sent where no gpg key is found. Perhaps there could be a warning and resend, eg &#x27;Some of the recipients for this mail have no gpg keys. Please reply to this message to confirm you understand that this message will be sent unencrypted to those recipients&#x27;?<p>Also, if you can solve the user experience problem with generating and using GPG keys, you will be doing the world a great service.<p>Good luck!

My disgust doesn&#x27;t matter. Their relationship is none of my business. Laws against gay marriage are in a similar vein to sodomy laws, namely, a bunch of hateful, entitled, &quot;revolted&quot; traditionalists who want to leverage the force of the government to prevent consenting adults from living their lives in a way that <i>affects nobody but themselves</i>.

We&#x27;re horribly bad at guessing what will provide the best payoff for us over time. And even when we <i>know</i>, we are horribly bad at making use of that knowledge rather than letting ourselves be led by impulses.<p>To take the lottery example: How many people do you think would opt for $1m today vs. $10000 this year, $12000 the following year, $14000 the year after, and so on, until they&#x27;d have received, say, $3m? Pretty much all research into both lottery winners and the way we judge rewards now vs. later indicates that most of us would likely opt for the $1m now, yet be less happy for it over time vs. an option where we can look forward to steadily increasing rewards over a long period of time.<p>I&#x27;d be willing to be that you could show people data on how the options would likely affect their happiness, and the majority of people would still opt for the $1m now, and go out and start spending.",1395763390

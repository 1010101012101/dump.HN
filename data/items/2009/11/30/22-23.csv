And I can agree that some (a lot?) of the skits in Meaning of Life are pure gold, but overall it lacks the narrative that ties both Brian and Grail together.<p>Life of Brian being rated as one of the best British comedies I can understand if only because it had more of a broader appeal (at least more widespread coverage thanks to the religious hullaballoo).<p>Grail on the other hand, may appeal to the cult market more and be more popular on that front (being the type of people who might vote on IMDB).<p>I'm grasping at straws here, but at least in my books the religious aspect of Brian (combined with the overall quality of the film) would lead me to say that it's more important than the other two Python films.<p>It's also telling that the two films you regard as better than Life of Brian are both by the Pythons :)",1259621599

Second, Dubai is not a third world country, so\nI really doubt the workers are spending 11 cents a meal.

Costs  of  food  products  are\nespecially  high...  Water is  generally  expensive  all across  the\ncountry... Dubai  relies mostly on  imported food and  drinks, which\nexplains why they are also more expensive.""</i><p>The monthly  cost of  food of 500  Euro is about  $750, more  than 5\ntimes  the monthly  wage mentioned  in the  article. Of  course, the\ntypical slave worker  probably isn't going to be  eating food that's\nas expensive  as that  of your  typical Western  expat, but  I doubt\nthey'd survive on $10 of food a month, which\nis what three 11 cent meals a day totaled over a month would amount to.<p>Then there's the  debt that the slave workers get  in to to just\nhave the  opportunity to  work in  Dubai. The  article quotes  it as\n£2,300 ($3,772), which would take 25 months to work off at the $147\nper  month salary,  if  we don't  count the  cost of  living in\nDubai (which would make repaying the debt even harder).<p>Finally, there are the dangerous work conditions, physical violence, and the non-payment and delay of salaries that the article mentions, which would literally put the workers' lives in jeopardy.

The system that works with finite sets of taking the number of things you're interested in and dividing by the number of things that might happen doesn't apply.  Contradictions and/or inconsistencies arise from that sort of thinking, seductive though it is.<p>My example about the ranges was an attempt to show that the otherwise excellent ideas from the finite world simply don't apply, so you have to do something else.  You suggested that ...<p><pre><code>  > If the probability of producing the desired result\n  > in any given attempt is zero, then the probability\n  > of producing the desired result given infinite\n  > attempts is still zero.\n</code></pre>\n... and that's what I was refuting.<p>And perhaps the things to take away from this is that just because the probability of an event is zero, that doesn't mean the event can't happen.

Quark XPress 3.3 is an excellent model for how to do it: boxes, that you put on a page and then fill with text or pictures.<p>If you're just bashing out text, it can works largely as a word processor does today, just with one text box filling the page. But if you want to position or format things with any accuracy, you can manipulate them directly into boxes without the heartaches of doing so in any contemporary word processor.<p>It's a very simple conceptual model, easy to grasp and easier to use. I skipped both of my parents straight past word processors and after the vaguest of introductions to XPress they're now both producing complicated documents that are effectively impossible to create in Word.<p>Of course, something like XPress takes processing power, and it wasn't available in the early GUI days -- typing a document straight into XPress or Pagemaker was an exercise in frustration. So developers and users went down the ""enhanced typewriter"" route of MacWrite.<p>If we could start again, however, Mid-90s-style DTP would be the way to do it -- you don't need the complexity of something like InDesign: just a few simple tools and a floating palette for fonts and styles. Most of the common frustrations people have creating documents today would just vanish.<p>Apple has taken steps towards this model with Pages, but they haven't had the gumption to go the whole hog just yet, and what Word Processor DNA remains hampers it a bit.

Once I get BibTeX references to compile correctly, I can just <i>\cite</i> (even <i>\possessivecite</i> or <i>\citeasnoun</i>) and not have to worry about dangling bibliography sources that aren't used anywhere in the paper, citation style inconsistencies (where does the volume number go again?), making typos in separate references to the identical source, and so on.  Did I change the order of some figures?  <i>\ref</i> will still refer to the correct number.  I could highlight some word and chord a shortcut to italicize something, then have the processor try to be smarter than me about what should and should not be italicized after that, etc.  But I'd rather <i>\emph</i> a word and be done with it (and be able to do things like <i>\usepackage{ulem}</i> to change emphasis to underlines instead).  Rather than tabbing back and forth to try to get the proper list structure when the processor gets confused about line breaks, I can textually mark <i>where</i> I want the list to begin/end, where it should nest, etc.  Instead of wading through menus and searching for a picture of an A with an umlaut, I can just type <i>H\"{a}agen-Dazs</i> directly.  I can do all of this in Vim, where I have productive text-editing commands and even spell-checking.  Not to mention typesetting math!<p>The post's tone is objectionable, I suppose.  I'm sure LaTeX is not for everyone.  The learning curve's too high for your standard high-school kid writing an English paper, and the payoff is minimal in such cases since word processors have many of the same features for managing bibliographies, header formats, etc.  But compared to just <i>typing</i> it in plain text, using a word processor feels horrifically obtuse to me.",1259619662

Since these nodes are fairly affordable (probably $500) and relatively low power (probably 10-15 watts, you're left with nodes that 1) offer 1/3rd the performance but are 1/5th the price and use 1/20th the power 2) can be scaled cheaply and predictability, particularly as it pertains to laying out your datacenter power and cooling infrastructure.<p>Also, for people who don't have complete control of their data center (they're renting rack space), it eliminates a significant amount of headache finagling your datacenter to provide enough amperage to your rack, and eliminates surprise deficiencies in their cooling infrastructure.... lessons I've learned the hard way.  Micro-servers let you scale at a much more granular level so that you aren't rolling out several kilowatts of servers at a time, and let you avoid carrying excess capacity as you wait to grow-into it (only to scramble to scale after you're full-up again)",1259618692

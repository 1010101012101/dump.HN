9330658,comment,9329138,9330583,0,0,ics,,,"No, it&#x27;s the universal sign for &quot;this is the thing that needs to be removed&quot;. Unfortunately they don&#x27;t have cones which read &quot;unauthorized object subject to removal immediately&quot; which would get the point across while preserving people&#x27;s ability to see it until it was removed or properly evaluated. That would make the whole issue of removal look even <i>more</i> Orwellian though, would it not?<p>The reason why I brought up the potential danger of the statue is not because I or anyone expects it to be dangerous. (For a relevant incident though, remember the Boston Aqua Teen Hunger Force stuff... that got a terrible reaction, even though anyone who has ever played with electronics could tell that they were harmless. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Boston_bomb_scare"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Boston_bomb_scare</a> ) I bring it up because it is both department policy and perfectly valid from the perspective of anyone who works to ensure safety in parks. If some circumstance, however crazy, causes someone to become injured by the installation then it&#x27;s going to be a much bigger headache to Parks and Rec than a bunch of us calling them fascists/communists/whatever else is going on in here.<p>Edit: In case I wasn&#x27;t clear, the point of my analogy is that... <i>as far as you know</i> it&#x27;s just an image on the boot screen. As far as you know, it&#x27;s just a sculpture that&#x27;s properly installed and isn&#x27;t going to just roll off as soon as some kids try to climb it (park employees try to stop this too, but it&#x27;s still common esp. at this park). If it was an official installation, presumably Parks and Rec would have enough confidence in the work itself to say &quot;this is fine&quot; and then take responsibility for it in the future. Perhaps a better analogy would&#x27;ve been if someone pulled a similar stunt on NYPL&#x27;s public computers or something, <i>shrug</i>. (I have no righteous love for my own analogy here, I just thought it would make the issue a little more clear. I seem to have been wrong about that.)",1428353910

I&#x27;m trying to be as aggressive as possible paying off my debt (my debt payoff is a little over 30% of what I take home monthly and I plan on using the &quot;snowball method&quot; so that number will not change as I pay off debt to accelerate the payoff) because it doesn&#x27;t seem smart to give away money when that puts me on the hook for more money (interest). If there is an error in this logic I would greatly appreciate it being pointed out to me.<p>I&#x27;d be interested in increasing my charitable contributions but I&#x27;m not sure where would be best to send more money to. I am personally a fan of direct charity instead of going through an organization as I feel it reduces overhead. I like Kiva loans because once I get paid back I just re-loan the money so that slowly I am increasing the amount I loan monthly while keeping my monthly contribution the exact same (or slowly increasing it, I want to get to $50/mo within a few months). I also like Kiva because I know exactly how much is going to Kiva vs the person asking for money (something that is hidden or hard to find out for most charities IMHO).<p>My approach is not based on anything specific it&#x27;s more of just what has happened naturally since I started working full time.",1428353746

It is solely by these people&#x27;s sense of moral agency that the wrongdoings came to light!

Plus the cost basis for employment like customer service and manual money processing is a bit better. And lastly, the regulatory burden is often lighter. In the US to get money transmitter licenses in all states is already a few million, and much more in surety bonds (which you can pay for yourself for many millions, or buy, but very few companies want to offer a surety bond to a bitcoin company right now, and virtually nobody to new startups)<p>I mean I agree, it&#x27;s true that the US/Europe are the large markets. But there are so many exchanges serving this market that a new exchange can barely get customers/volume, and therefore it&#x27;s hard to be cash flow positive. And you&#x27;re competing for financial services with modern banking, Paypal, Stripe, Creditcards etc. And you&#x27;re competing with the dollar, a stable currency.<p>But in various African markets, there&#x27;s no modern payment system and volatile high-inflation currencies. In those markets a bitcoin exchange, linked to say a dollar-pegging service like Bitreserve, is an interesting use case. And there&#x27;s few other exchanges competing for those customers.<p>If I want to send money to family in France, it&#x27;s literally free from the Netherlands. Bitcoin isn&#x27;t super useful for this kind of transaction. But sending money back to say family in the Phillipines can often cost me 5% or so, while bitcoin exchanges in the Phillipines allow me to buy bitcoin here for 0% or near 0%, send it there for near 0% costs, and sell it there for 1-2%. Bitcoin actually undercuts banks in many countries outside the OECD. In OECD countries like the US or Europe, bitcoin is less useful.<p>And there already are exchanges in South America, Africa, Asia btw, which are doing fine. But it&#x27;s definitely not a goldmine, don&#x27;t get me wrong. It&#x27;s just that you can hardly start a new exchange and compete in Europe or the US anymore, while other continents aren&#x27;t easy either, it&#x27;s comparatively easier to become cash flow positive.",1428353239

Maybe I like their expertise and I&#x27;m not ready to condemn Kubernetes and its quality just yet because it&#x27;s young and who knows where they&#x27;ll go. Maybe they&#x27;ll separate Omega from google3 and land it in Kubernetes. Then what?<p>Mesos and Mesosphere talk a lot about scale, with the implication that the technology you&#x27;re modeling powers the entire Google fleet in one big harmonious system. It doesn&#x27;t. There&#x27;s a fairly hard upper limit on the system you mentioned in terms of scale, which is one of the motivations for Omega. The system you mentioned also fits into an ecosystem from a DLM[0] to a RPC system to a build system and on up. Pieces of that are gradually being open-sourced, too, like Bazel. Google is clearly becoming aware that their infrastructure being generally available will benefit the industry enormously, and regardless of my personal feelings on their business model and exploitation of user data, <i>that</i> is a good thing. If you&#x27;re telling me that Mesos can do better than all of that expertise, better than John Wilkes, better than all of that, to the point where you don&#x27;t even consider Kubernetes on the same <i>path</i> as Mesos, I don&#x27;t know what to tell you other than come back to reality. This seems to be a rut with Apache projects that model Google systems in some way: Zookeeper, Mesos, Hadoop, Flume. All of them look like if I described the systems in question over a very blurry fax, and the open-source community did its best. That&#x27;s not outright criticism, it&#x27;s just having the unique experience of having seen their Google counterparts; it&#x27;s a good thing they exist, but there are absolutely opportunities to do better, Mesos included.<p>I get what you&#x27;re trying to do with Mesos, but I strongly disagree with your characterization of Mesosphere as a datacenter operating system. It&#x27;s disingenuous, and positioning Mesosphere as the only company who can do hyperscale in containers is a tough sell. Last time I used Mesos, in 2012, it could barely handle 100 machines and I had to write shell scripts to even get a simple static application scheduled. I then threw 10,000 jobs at it and the scheduler hung and took down the entire cluster. Clearly you have come a long way since then, but it&#x27;s apparently easy for you to forget that given the age of Kubernetes.<p>[0]: You&#x27;ll pardon me if the thought of Zookeeper doesn&#x27;t excite me as the backbone of the entire system.",1428352444

This suggests that our dietary optimum is broad and shallow, whereas a great deal of dietary research seems aimed at the belief that our dietary optimum is narrow and deep, so if we could just discover the <i>precisely right</i> diet we would live in good health for substantially longer.<p>This may be the case, but my personal bet is that in my lifetime a) no such discovery will be made and b) it will continue to be <i>extremely</i> lucrative selling this implausible idea to the public in various guises, from &quot;superfoods&quot; to weird eating patterns.<p>Of these, intermittent fasting seems at least to be a reasonably effective way of dealing with the caloric overabundance we live in the midst of in the West, and is also well within the (arguably very broad) envelope of our evolutionary adaptations. It is also at the very least benign and quite possibly marginally better than many alternatives.",1428351959

A point on a unit circle describes a triangle formed by the horizontal step along the X axis, and then a vertical step to get to the circle. The sine is the vertical step, for a unit circle.  For a non-unit circle, this has the wrong scale, which is normalized by dividing by the circle radius. And that radius happens to be the third side of the triangle, the hypotenuse. You can ignore the triangle aspect when you assume the unit circle, which makes the hypotenuse 1.",1428351952

I think NASA is a great example of software assurance done right.  Outside of the SC area, I don&#x27;t see how you can come to that conclusion: take the perceived decline in Apple&#x27;s software quality as one example.<p>> The space shuttle, commonly referred to as the most complex machine ever built, has around 2.5 million parts. The Linux kernel alone has over 16 million source lines of code. It&#x27;s an order of magnitude more complex than the SPACE SHUTTLE!.<p>I think this is a nonsensical comparison, but if you want to go with it, consider that each of the Space Shuttle parts has multiple steps going into it&#x27;s creation.  It&#x27;d be slightly more fair to say that the Space Shuttle has 2.5 million <i>functions</i> and compare that to the Linux kernel, but it remains a nonsensical comparison.<p>>Anyone who&#x27;s ever done software development, will tell you that the order for these is something like: 2b, 2a, 2b, 2d, 2c, oh - someone&#x27;s asking for sizings, better do some 1 - 2d, 2c, 2d, 2b, 2a, 2d...<p>Anyone who&#x27;s done work in a regulated environment will tell you that while your suggested process may happen in the conception stage for preliminary testing, once you&#x27;re under design control you follow formally documented procedures in the order that they are specified.<p>> There&#x27;s got to be a better way to codify what we actually do when we develop good software.

Highly available distributed services need to have geographical diversity, i.e. they should be &quot;multihomed&quot;.  This is true on AWS or in Google&#x27;s internal data centers.  That means you have WAN latency, in which case locality becomes again the primary design concern for performance.<p>Pre-Spanner, Google&#x27;s solution was to use application-specific logic to be multihomed -- i.e. nearly rewrite your application, depending on how stateful it is.  Spanner isn&#x27;t a silver bullet either.  You still have to solve latency problems, just within the ontology of Spanner rather than the application.<p>It&#x27;s bad for your code to ignore latency within the data center, and then later add (incorrect) hacks to work around latency between data centers.  If you pay attention to network boundaries from the beginning, it will be easier to multi-home.<p>2. A single machine is still your domain of failure.  Even if it doesn&#x27;t matter for performance, you still have think about machines to handle failures.<p>The interfaces between machines should be idempotent to handle failures gracefully.  And many distributed storage services have complicated performance vs. durability knobs for how many machines/processes have accepted writes.<p>So I think Google does have a &quot;single system image&quot; bias, and you are right that Kubernetes has these Google-isms in its architecture.",1428350993

The whole point of duck-typing is that objects can be referred to generically even in cases where their underlying type would be undecidable.<p>Type-inferencing gives you some of the source-level flexibility of not having to refer directly to an object&#x27;s type much like duck-typing, but without many of the crazy runtime disasters that you can get with duck-typing.",1428350794

A lot of cameras are capable of 16bit for internal processing but are limited to 8 or 10bit for encoding (outside some raw solutions). An ideal workflow is that raw codec (though it&#x27;s often a 10bit file instead of raw) going straight to color (me working at 32) and then I deliver at 10bit from which 8bit final delivery files (outside of theatrical releases which work off 16bit files and incidentally use 24bit for the audio) are generated.

A good currency is expected to experience a 1-3% annual inflation, in order to decentivize hoarding and remove barriers to cash flow.<p>Bitcoin is deflationary by design, and this is a key distinction to make.  There is a definite future for an international cryptocurrency, but the <i>implementation</i> known as bitcoin is not it - exactly because of what you said, it is designed to be a store of value, not a currency.  Many bitcoin evangelists will claim that theoretical soft forks can be made to solve this, by adding more supply and making bitcoin inflationary, but to do so requires 51% of miners to agree to it - which is irrational because it would devalue the miners&#x27; holdings and infrastructure.<p>Hence we&#x27;re back at Bitcoin suffering from <i>tragedy of the commons</i>, which is by design as you point out.",1428350703

One of the minor culture shocks I experienced coming to the US (from the UK) was the variety of billboards, radio, and TV ads encouraging people to donate their car, or boat, or whatever to this or that charity. At first I wondered why so many different charities were involved in giving cars to poor people, until someone explained that it was because you could (then) deduct the general market rate for the make and model of car involved. Nowadays they require more detailed documentation, eg the nonprofit has to give the donor a copy of the bill of sale within 30 days so that the donor knows how much to deduct. Turns out that some generous souls were inflating the size of their charitable donation on the tax forms in order to reduce their tax liability.<p>I also can&#x27;t help noticing that some people who extol the virtues of religious giving are strenuously opposed to any expansion of government services, and seem to consider the whole idea of government taxation an intolerable confiscation of their money and thus an infringement upon their liberty.

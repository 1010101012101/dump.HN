sell order can trigger extreme price movements, especially if the automated execution 
algorithm does not take prices into account. Moreover, the interaction between automated 
execution programs and algorithmic trading strategies can quickly erode liquidity and result in 
disorderly markets.</i><p><a href=""http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/2010/marketevents-report.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/2010/marketevents-report.pdf</a>",1335477572

And if you have a team of workaholics who never take time off, then those payouts could get big.<p>I worked for a company whose policy was to cap vacation payouts when people left. The employee handbook stated that you'd be paid a maximum of 40 hours vacation unless state law at your work location said otherwise. If you had more than 5 days vacation in your bucket, well, tough luck.  Luckily I lived/worked in IL at the time I quit that job, and IL forbids this.<p>When researching that, I noticed there's a disparity among states in terms of how vacation time is treated.  Some states treat accrued vacation time as earned compensation that just hasn't yet been paid, and must be paid on termination. Other states treat vacation time as an agreement that you just don't have to come into work and you'll still get paid, and the employer is free to pay out vacation accruals however they like (or not at all).<p>It seems like by providing no defined accruals of vacation time, you step around the whole ""earned yet unpaid compensation"" and turn time off into an agreement that you won't come in and they will still pay you.",1335477012

I don't think anybody seriously thinks algorithmic trading is bad per se.<p>The third link talks about reducing the bid/ask spread. Fair enough. However, what people seem to forget in these discussions is that if you are genuinely trading in the long run, then the bid/ask spread is mostly irrelevant anyway, because it is totally dominated by intraday fluctuations. Whether I buy at the offered price at 12am vs 1pm makes a much bigger difference than whether a HFT reduced the spread by some small amount. I have yet to see an argument that the sum of intraday fluctuations + bid/ask spread is helped at all by HFT.<p>So one study remains (this one: <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1624329"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1624329</a>).

3896141,comment,3895241,3895443,5,0,peeters,,,"Here's my take.  Google has a list of things that they think can be decreed by the judge rather than the jury as a matter of law, given the evidence presented.<p>1) You can't claim ownership of the <i>idea</i> (the APIs) rather than the <i>creative writing</i> (the implementation).<p>2) The API declarations are not copyrightable for the same reason that you can't copyright a short phrase, like ""Mary shears sheep.""  Furthermore, Google needed to be precise in copying the signatures, since changing would lead to incompatibility (with both the programmer's assumptions and their existing Java code).<p>3) The stuff that Google copied verbatim (or close to verbatim) was negligible.  The ONLY thing that Google copied that was actually distributed on a phone was a 9-line function called rangeCheck() that any novice could write.  It was only included because Josh Bloch used it when writing an alternative sorting method that he <i>thought</i> would eventually be merged into the Arrays class (where it would have direct access to the original method).  Everything else is test classes and a couple of comments.<p>As part of this argument, Google tries to argue that the infringements are negligible with regards to the ""work as a whole,"" which they argue is all of J2SE 5 (as that is how Oracle registered the copyright).  I don't think this argument stands up.  Oracle cites plenty of previous copyright cases where the judge has considered less than the overarching work as the ""work as a whole"" (for example, a defendant tried to argue that the article they had copied verbatim from a magazine was a small piece of the work as a whole (the magazine itself), but the judge considered the article itself to be a work.  In this case it was still determined that the article was used under fair use provisions however).<p>4) Google's documentation of the APIs doesn't infringe.  First, they are similar in substance because they are talking about the same idea.  Programmers have common terminology and ways of talking about ideas (in this case, what a method/class does)  that become more similar when you consider the fact they are trying to be succinct and unambiguous.  Second, they are similar in organization because they use the Javadoc tool, which automatically generates docs from comments attached to the API declarations themselves.  In other words, if the APIs are not seen as infringing, then neither can the Javadoc structure.  They should not be considered a separate act of infringement.<p>5 and 6 were less interesting to me and were more about Google trying to get off on a technicality, so I don't summarize them here.",1335474458

IMO that's worth the tradeoff, but if you feel differently, then don't bother with Connect (though I'm curious what concrete concerns you have, more specific than just ""opening them up to even more tracking"").<p>As far as reliability goes, I agree that minimizing external dependencies is a good idea.  Again, this is a tradeoff - you're saying ""I want to work on things that are specific to my app or site, not this boring login stuff that has already been solved.""  I suspect that in reality, our uptime is good enough that sites are more likely to notice issues from their own (or their hosting provider's) instability than from ours.  But you're right - this does introduce the possibility of login being broken for your site if Facebook is broken.  Hopefully the benefits Connect offers outweigh this risk, but again, you're fee to not use it.<p>> Storing and properly hash passwords is not hard to do.<p>Perhaps it's not that hard, but many still people fail to do it properly. And it's still not a silver bullet - even properly hashed passwords, when exposed from a compromised DB, can be reversed. Regardless, this is only a small part of the problem - dealing with stolen (e.g. phished) credentials is another, arguably more important, problem that's much more difficult.<p>> Todo: Create multiple fake facebook accounts for such services, can't believe I haven't done this already.<p>Please don't do that.

3896119,comment,3893938,3895341,1,0,christoph,,,"Thanks for the agreement & sorry, maybe I wasn't very clear.. :)<p>I'm not a Nintendo naysayer at all or suggesting impending doom for them either. I have every Nintendo console going back to the NES with a large catalog of (much loved) games on each.<p>I wasn't saying MW3 for 3.99 on the Wii (or any other platform). I was more saying the market for MW3 doesn't/didn't exist on the Wii (almost at any price point). High value console games will be around for some time yet, this just isn't Nintendo's marketplace, nor has it been for sometime. Big blockbusters will still sell, just only on non-Nintendo platforms.<p>Nintendo had a great strategy (red ocean/blue ocean) with the Wii that paid off greatly. It feels a little like their blue ocean isn't really there anymore. I see all the kids now sitting around playing Angry Birds on iDevices and it just feels that with the European/US economy in it's current state, parents are more likely to fill their kids on $2 purchases rather than $20-$30 ones. Especially when there will be a $200-$300 barrier to entry as well.<p>Nintendo will succeed in their homeland, they always will - I just wonder if they will do so well in other territories in the next couple of years.",1335474199

Misogyny is not funny, regardless what the pretense of it is.<p>""It's just a joke"" is <i>straight</i> out of the misogyny flow chart.

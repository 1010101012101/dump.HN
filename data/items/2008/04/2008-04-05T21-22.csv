155812,comment,155712,155781,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"We can only hope.  What I really like about solar-thermal power is the cost.  It's actually cheaper to produce power plants, and the power generated is rapidly becoming cheaper than fossil fuel power.  That, and you don't have the base load power problem that you have with photo-voltaic power.<p>I'm sure that there's problems with it.

So I no longer consider it news when Microsoft goes on stage and talks about what could be coming to market.  They ""could"" be doing a lot of things, it doesn't mean they will succeed.<p>I am more impressed when Microsoft releases proof, like a demo.  For example, Microsoft Research's video on their Surface technology was quite impressive, and showed just what the company has been up to.",1207431187

Talk to experienced people, get advice, and make the people that give you good advice your informal advisors.  It's easier if you let it be a natural process, rather than a forced ""advisor recruitment drive"".  It's never too early or too late for good advisors.  A Board is a different matter entirely, and something that someone more qualified can comment on.",1207429976

This is part of what I was getting at in this comment:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=144616"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=144616</a><p>Specifically, where I say that ""Sometimes people manage to acquire the necessary values and thus the skills necessary to do well, despite starting off in adverse conditions. But they're the exceptions, and were psychologically and sociologically positioned to be that way.""  When some folks try to deny that there are any serious psychological and sociological barriers to success by pointing to those rare individuals who overcome socioeconomic adversity, they are ignoring the very phenomena these researchers are talking about.  Some individuals are simply better positioned than their peers when it comes to dealing with the same conditions.<p>Thankfully, the research also has the effect of helping us to figure out how to overcome debilitating stereotypes, but one can hardly expect someone who grew up in the inner city to be reading SciAm.",1207429884

I love his songs, but he's a hero for how he thinks and writes about music and the music industry. His ""The Problem With Music,"" his review of Slint's ""Spiderland,"" and his ""Remembering a Friend"" (about Silkworm's Michael Dahlquist) could be Paul Graham essays.<p>Judith Martin (Miss Manners). What PG wrote about Wodehouse and Austen applies to Martin, especially her early work, which is among the funniest, most sane, best written, and most useful writing I've ever encountered.<p>Bill James (the baseball writer).

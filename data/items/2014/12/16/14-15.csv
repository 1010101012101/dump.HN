However the issue is search - which is probably one major aspect of the &quot;friction&quot; mentioned in the parent post:\n1. Patents are often not exactly written to easily give their secrets (I would say there are specific forms of patent legalese). \n2. You need (costly) experts to look at potential offers.<p>In addition, there are more disincentives to &quot;easy&quot; IP transactions:\n1. Even when you&#x27;ve found a matching patent it doesn&#x27;t mean that you can just pop out a product. Most of the actual work is still ahead of you.\n2. Pricing and contract negotiation is rather difficult and costs as well.\n3. The existing marketplaces are mostly rather small with the largest having maybe 20-30k offers. Just not enough to impact the myriads of problems available...<p>Still interested? Just reply, maybe I can help.",1418741919

I&#x27;ve only been here 4 years and I&#x27;ve been desired by other teams and at least a half dozen occasions - I do my job, I learn the technology and processes used here, I solve problems, I deliver, I am reliable and consistent, I treat people with respect, etc. Even still being a junior, if I lost my job today, I&#x27;d have at least 3 different job offers in different areas of the company just by my perceived worth. No, I&#x27;m not a brown noser.<p>So my question is, how can one work for a company for so many years, deliver and execute on so many projects, only to be invisible to the entire organization? This makes it sound like these are line workers getting laid off despite their long-term employment with the company.<p>If I was as invisible in my current job as these people were, I&#x27;d be looking for a new job so that I can actually be valued for my worth. Are these people victims, or are they mediocre and their career came to an end sooner than retirement?<p>Just a perspective, don&#x27;t hate.<p>Edit: My company isn&#x27;t one that values young workers - our primary TS core is older.

Sweetness - strawberry perhaps?\n2. Sourness - a lemon?\n3. Saltiness - a saltine cracker maybe? Thirsty?\n4. Bitterness - funny how the lips pucker from Grapefruit.\n5.

The downside to that is that Go might not ever be suited for certain domains: the upside is that automatic memory management is good enough for arguably <i>most</i> domains. Now, consider that many Go developers are coming from scripting languages; using Go gives them a lot of the performance boost, without also having to worry about the lifetime of their memory. And if they were using Python beforehand, chances are that implementing everything in C/C++/Rust instead won&#x27;t really be necessary for them. Go gives good enough performance.<p>This overall comparison might be a dead end, though. After all, we&#x27;re comparing languages that effectively only have in common that they seem to have been spawned at vaguely the same time. Their philosophies are totally different.",1418740650

8757280,comment,8754910,8756552,0,0,warfangle,,,"I hear/read your first argument quite a bit. It&#x27;s a fantastic piece of social engineering, because it both reduces and reinforces a fundamental cognitive dissonance: Bribes are used to coerce; politicians shouldn&#x27;t be corrupt and accept bribes; politicians accept vast amounts of campaign money. To ease this dissonance, equating campaign/PAC contributions to celebrity endorsement is amazingly well suited: how could Oprah possibly have that much sway over, say, a piece of federal pork for a dioxin spewing chemical company?<p>The basic difference, of course, is that social capital is very much different than monetary capital. One is used to buy things, and the other is used to boost signals. One can be taken away by the same individuals who gave it in the first place; the other is taken away at a publicly specified rate, but can be given away freely or traded for goods and services.<p>Oprah can use her celebrity voice to endorse one or ten or one hundred candidates. There are diminishing returns, of course: how much of a signal boost would it be if Oprah endorsed just everyone? The only time she loses her influence is if she spends too much of it in the same category too quickly, or if the signal she chooses to boost is disagreed with by those who lend her credence and give her the social capital in the first place.<p>As a signal multiplier, its function is fundamentally different than the signal multiplier of money.<p>When money is spent, if enough money is available, it can be used to endorse one or ten or one hundred candidates with none of the same diminishing returns. It does not lose its effectiveness if it is spent too quickly on too many different things. If this were about a companies publicly endorsing candidates (and by doing so, putting their brand&#x27;s reputation on the line) it would be one thing. But this is about companies (or individuals) being able to disproportionately influence policy without risking their own reputation by being associated with the crafting of that policy.<p>2. If you want to curtail the size of the federal government, one thing you might be interested in is campaign finance reform - so your elected politicians aren&#x27;t as interested in doing favors for <AARP|Dow Chemical|The Teamsters|Focus on the Family|Goldman Sachs> and are more interested in the plight of their actual constituents.<p>3. It could be, but you&#x27;re dreaming if that would ever happen with the number of favors owed the private sector by congress.<p>He&#x27;s nailed the arguments, but I don&#x27;t think new law is ever going to fix it.<p>The only way to fix it is by making money irrelevant to re-election.<p>(edit: let me put it in a different way than all that stuff about cognitive dissonance and social capital. You ask what the difference is between an Oprah endorsement and a campaign contribution; I&#x27;ll ask you: what is the difference between a Facebook status update that gets shared 1,000 times and a Facebook status update the author of which pays for it to show up on 1,000 timelines?)",1418740620

Producing four fewer F35&#x27;s would save more money, just on initial cost...never mind that the costs of operating just one well exceed $700k a year.<p>For anyone with a passing interest in the integrity of journalism, the J-2x rocket engine for which the A-3 Test Stand was built to test was let on a $1.2 billion dollar contract to Pratt & Whittney RocketDyne. The program was only killed this year [1]...and a new $2.8 billion dollar contract to develop the alternative was let just this July to Boeing. Purportedly this contract was a continuation of an undefined contract with Boeing let back in 2007 -- the same year as the A-3 Test Platform broke ground.[2]<p>What NASA got for the money is an additional capability that is reasonably likely to be useful over the next several decades so long as manned missions beyond LEO remain within the agency&#x27;s potential mandate.

I&#x27;m sure it would improve performance, but nowhere near what GPU advocates would claim.<p>My biggest reason?\n&quot;PCIe transfer time to/from GPU&quot;, plus it would be unoptimized GPU code. Once you read a few of these papers it becomes painfully obvious that a lot of tuning goes into the GPU algorithms that offer anything more than a low single-digit factor of speedup. It&#x27;s still very significant (cutting a 3 hour algorithm down to 1 would be huge) but if you&#x27;re in an early stage of research it may be a toss-up over whether its better to just tune the algorithm itself / run computations overnight rather than going through the trouble of writing a GPU-based POC. Maybe if you have 1 or 2 under your belt its not such a big deal but for most of the researchers I know GPU algorithm rewrites would not be trivial. (I&#x27;ve been doing enterprise Java coding for about 2 years now so the idea isn&#x27;t so intimidating now, but in a past life of mucking around with Matlab scripts I&#x27;m sure it would have been daunting).",1418739356

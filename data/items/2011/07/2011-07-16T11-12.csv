In this particular case, there was clearly a failure to see that the developer was getting bored and so nobody expected him to leave.  He had a private office, flexible hours, freedom to work on open source projects, and excellent benefits (profit sharing, pensions, etc) -- but I found after he left that bioinformatics development was just not his interest. He jumped to a startup that used the open source code he contributed to.  So in this case, management was not taking advantage.  Perhaps the other way around. But based on comments so far, employee management relationships seem not so good, in general, for developers.",1310816353

I believe that is considered by the SEC to be restricted stock, so to sell it I will need to follow Rule 144.<p>However, as I understand it, from the perspective of the IRS, it is no restricted as it is an outright stock grant with no vesting or other such provisions.<p>So, given the above, let me lay out a scenario:<p>I earn 100 shares of the stock at a rate of $1/share.  On the day that I invoice for this stock, it is worth $1.50/share.  After six months, when I am able to sell the stock, I sell it at $2/share.<p>As best I understand it, under section 83(a), I have to report the full $1.50 as income on the day I receive it.  Section 83(b) does not apply as it is not restricted stock from the perspective of the IRS.  As such, when I sell the stock at $2, it is taxed as capital gains.<p>Is my understanding correct?",1310815323
2770568,comment,2767867,2767867,5,0,k_kisiel,,,"Hi all, earth rotated, greetings from another side of the globe. There are many good points in the article, but not this one:<p>""Communal (including communist) countries remain primitive and poor, whereas the rich, advanced nations have gotten where they are by means of economic exchange.""<p>From European (continental) perspective, that statement is false. Rich countries in Europe (Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway etc.) are observably more communal than poorer countries. Division is not between the former Communist countries vs. other countries. Among the former the more communal, bourgeois-oriented Czech Republic has bigger GDP per capita than more individualistic, nobility-oriented Hungary or Poland. More communal means richer, how weird! Why is that?<p>My favorite theory explaining it is based on historical military considerations - countries in mainland Europe have long land borders other countries of approximately equal size and development level. In order to maintain sovereignty a country (or other ""culture"" as defined in the article, say independent city) needs as many soldiers as possible. So it pays to offer free medical care and welfare to the population so that all citizens are stay in good health and can, if necessary, defend the country and it's culture. So it was beneficial to the country to divide resources more equally rather than based on equity. Prime example is Switzerland which was founded in exactly these circumstances and look where they are: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_...</a>.",1310815307

2770564,comment,2767867,2770497,2,0,chakde,,,"A few points<p>1. There is a much bigger correlation with India than you suppose.<p>You can 
a. build universities and schools to train people 
b. create favorable tax and corporate structures to foster industry 
c. capture markets to make a and b and c into a positive feedback loop that makes rapid advancement possible.<p>Guess which of these is the hardest. It is c - having a captive market. The british captured the Indian market through money and cunning and proceded to systematically weaken then denude native industry then force export their own goods under the pretext of governance. The ratio of manufactures turned from something like 4:1 in India's favor in 1800 to 1:4 by 1900. This entire period was the one of greatest growth for the industrial revolution and it was in fact financed by India. As a french guy wrote, even if the french lost the war to the brits, it was beneficial for europe as this arrangement reduced the cost of development for all of europe. There was no capitalism or industrialism in the west before the Brits came to India.<p>2. There is no simply comparison between famines under the British, where supplies were not sent out even though they had control of them, and instead levies on starving peasants were increased 10% year over year and famines before and after. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_famine_of_1770"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_famine_of_1770</a><p>3. It has become standard practice in the west to use the caste system to whitewash British exploitation. Fact is British rule made the situation for the poorest in India much worse than it had ever historically been economically. 
Poor people could'nt even buy salt which was monopolized by the British for almost 200 years. This salt tax which Gandhi nonviolently protested against was not repealed until the British were kicked out of the country.<p>4.There was a popular election in 1939 which Jinnah lost even in muslim majority provinces in India. When Nehru tried to pressure the British to leave, Jinnah took the opportunity to get the Queen's support to launch a party which never got even the Muslim popular vote for a new country in the name of Islam. Hindu-muslim is kind of a false label for what actually happened.<p>Nothing against the British really - they took advantage of history when it was in their favor. It's just the false propaganda that they were somehow hugely beneficial for India that needs to be called out, something which has become truth by sheer repetition.",1310814719

My attention whore friends posted recently on Facebook about how they had G+ accounts, but not one of them posted anything, well at least publicly.<p>I consider both groups rather caustic. Group 1 tends to be quite depressive and negative as a bunch, they also prone to being preachy fan boys and interjecting opinion whether asked or not.

8948036,comment,8947603,8947939,0,0,brd,,,"> we should focus on teaching people how to model in general<p>Classes on logic and/or learning theory can accomplish that goal without any tools whatsoever. In fact, I&#x27;d argue we should teach people visio instead of excel if the only thing we&#x27;re shooting for is mental modeling. I&#x27;ve always thought the world would be a much better place if people leveraged concept maps more frequently.<p>> My point is we should fix that, instead of focusing on teaching people Python.<p>Again, I really get your point about not wanting a generation full of programmers but having gone through programming classes in HS I think it&#x27;s a non issue. I think I&#x27;m the only person from my HS programming class that went into programming as a trade. If anything, I think the thing worth attacking is the typical emphasis on the programming language as opposed to the process of programming. My HS 101 programming class was done with an overhead projector, mapping out what a loop was actually doing and visualizing the memory allocations being modified step by step. That&#x27;s the sort of thing we need more of. Just shoving syntax down a kid&#x27;s throat will do no good, on that we are absolutely on the same page.<p>P.S. I think you&#x27;re doing amazing work.

Then I had the unfortunate experience of changing jobs and ending up at a place where speed was king. Developers were worshiped by their ability to blast through projects. I would call this the &quot;Get Shit Done&quot; principle.<p>What I have found is that you need a balance. &quot;Slow the Fuck Down&quot; gets you working software, but if that takes you twelve months to a year, you lose the sense of progress and accomplishment that having a live product gives you. There has to be a healthy balance between &quot;Slow the Fuck Down&quot; and &quot;Get Shit Done&quot; which usually involves cutting features, prioritizing and temporary fixes.

Primarily because so few people you talk to on a day-to-day basis outside of tech are even capable of understanding the most basic concepts. I&#x27;ve even met plenty of people within tech that can&#x27;t. Introducing people to programming at an earlier age may help sure but we do that with writing and literacy and yet the list of people generally considered &quot;truly great&quot; at writing is still a very small percentage of the population. The big difference being that when I open my old, 1950&#x27;s typewriter, and decide to type up a little short story that would probably make Stephen King weep for his art, a billion dollar company doesn&#x27;t crash, a few million credit card numbers don&#x27;t get leaked, or any of the other countless things that go terribly wrong when programmers screw up.<p>I really do hope we get past the point where stuff like that is a regular occurrence, where computers and networks really are secure, and programming is taught at a young age. I just have trouble seeing any part of it becoming a reality any time soon.",1422291054

8947972,comment,8947603,8947603,0,0,danso,,,"I&#x27;ve been teaching programming to non-CS students at Stanford for the past month...they&#x27;re all clearly smarter than me. But what they lack, as does virtually every non-programmer I&#x27;ve worked with, is the ability to (initially) understand a for-loop.<p>It&#x27;s not that they don&#x27;t get that there is such a thing as a &quot;loop&quot;, or that a task can be broken up into iterations...they just don&#x27;t know what it means to design something that can iterate across a collection and, for each member of that collection, perform a task on it. It&#x27;s not merely not understanding the syntax, or the overall result...it&#x27;s not comprehending that you can design and control such a thing.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with non-programming professionals in which I&#x27;ve taken a repetitive task, such as extracting a bit of text from each page of thousands of pages of documents, and boiled it down to a program that saves them days of work. The effect of such a program is greatly appreciated...but time and time again, these non-programmers are delighted/astounded when I perform the same task in another scenario...what bothers me is all the times when I&#x27;m not there to recognize how such a problem can be abstracted, and they dive in head first into a meaningless, repetitive chore.<p>The abstraction of a task, so that it can be performed in a loop...it&#x27;s so fundamental that once you&#x27;ve done it, it&#x27;s hard <i>not</i> to think in those terms. And I wish it were the case that very intelligent people could just <i>get</i> it, in the same way that those who&#x27;ve never played an instrument can at least appreciate Mozart. But I just haven&#x27;t seen it...we programmers take for granted the ability to think in this profound way, and even though it&#x27;s fairly basic, as far as ComSci education goes, it really is a gamechanger in all areas of life and work. This is why I think programming deserves consideration as a kind of literacy.<p>Edit: To focus on something from the OP:<p>> <i>We don&#x27;t want a generation of people forced to care about Unicode and UI toolkits. We want a generation of writers, biologists, and accountants that can leverage computers.</i><p>Well, sure, if you boil coding down to &quot;Unicode&quot; and front-end web development, then yes, it&#x27;s not &quot;literacy&quot;. In the same way that if I boiled down traditional literacy to iambic pentameter and the debate between prescriptive and descriptive linguistics, I could make a compelling case for not learning to read and write.<p>Edit 2: I&#x27;m willing to consider programming as <i>not</i> a new literacy, but &quot;just&quot; a branch of math...but math practiced in a pragmatic, visceral way, not in the tepid, abstract way that it is forced upon us in primary school. I do think that programming is math, but with programming, you are actively building and testing something using the principles of math. If there&#x27;s a way to teach that kind of math without programming, I&#x27;m game for it.",1422291034

Objects start off &#x27;young&#x27;; when they survive a few collections they become &#x27;tenured&#x27;. Young objects are collected with a minor collection, which can happen concurrently with your code and doesn&#x27;t stop the world. Old objects are collected with a major collection, which does stop the world. If you&#x27;re writing a game, then minor collections are okay, but you want to avoid major collections at all costs.<p>This means that it&#x27;s okay to produce temporary objects that have very limited scopes; e.g., they&#x27;re allocated while processing a frame/game step and are discarded immediately. It&#x27;s also okay to produce objects that survive forever, because they won&#x27;t become garbage. The problem comes in the middle, if you make objects that last a while (significant fractions of a second or longer) but eventually become garbage. They have a chance of becoming tenured, and will build up until they trigger a major collection. At that point your game will stall for a while.<p>The other thing you&#x27;d want to change is to tell the GC to optimize for a maximum pause time with `-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=<nnn>` (by default it optimizes for throughput). For a game server, a maximum pause of something like 500ms would probably be unnoticeable by players.<p>More information:<p><a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/gctuning/toc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/gct...</a>",1422289923

Perhaps we are not on the same page.  Apologies if this is long.<p>1.  I am claiming that for many of these battles, it&#x27;s not simply political.  It&#x27;s a fight for the existential foundation of what the organization should be all about.  When the web team at Microsoft went head-to-head with the Windows team in the late 90s, that wasn&#x27;t simply a brouhaha over who should get power.  It was much more than that.  It was a question about Microsoft&#x27;s future ability to dominate/survive/die.  Yes, the weapons to fight the battles and the war are political in nature.  But something at that level isn&#x27;t simply about the politics.<p><i>> You&#x27;re most often actually fighting a political battle masqueraded as something else, and a necessary shift is to recognize that early on.</i><p>Likewise, let’s not let the weapons being used mislead us to incorrectly conclude what the fight&#x27;s really all about.<p>2.  Once the strategy has been decided by the top, it&#x27;s hard for one person, especially at lower levels, to change the momentum.  The executive team is all in.  If an executive is not all in, the executive is demoted, reallocated, or leaves the company.  It&#x27;s the CEO&#x27;s job to get his/her executive team on the same page.  He/she should have the political savvy necessary to accomplish this.  It’s each executive&#x27;s job to get their directors on the same page.  It&#x27;s each director&#x27;s job to get their senior management team on the same page.  It&#x27;s each senior manager&#x27;s job to get their managers on the same page.  And it keeps trickling down until it reaches the bottom.  A CEO who is not able to achieve this organizational buy-in cannot be considered someone who can lead the company.  Someone at the bottom cannot and will not change the existential direction of the company, no matter how politically savvy he/she is.<p>Once Microsoft settled that Windows would be their focus and won the browser wars with IE6, they sat on that for years.  It would not have mattered how politically talented you were, you were not going to convince Microsoft to invest into improving IE for a long, long time.  Pretty much the only way to win at this is to be a super genius and create something fantastic on your own time in secret from the organization.  Like the story of how OSX was ported to x86.  <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/11/3077651/apple-intel-mac-os-x-retrospective"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/11/3077651/apple-intel-mac-os...</a>  
Otherwise, you need a concerted effort from multiple parties and sponsorship and political protection from a very senior level.<p>3.  <i>> It will never be fun all the time. But you&#x27;re there for some reason, and the alternative is at best purposeless mediocrity.</i><p>Or you can leave if you can’t find any reason to stay.  Staying can also mould you into purposeless mediocrity, whether or not you resist it.  Let’s not underestimate our environment’s ability to influence our life, mindset, and behaviour.  When I was graduating from university, I asked a prof which job offer I should take.  He said whatever I choose, be careful if I choose the larger corporations.  He said they’re like zoos.  If you stay in them too long, you become tame and become unable to survive in the wild again.<p>Another piece of advice I received from a very senior engineer who had run his own fairly successful company was to always be aware of companies where decisions and promotions are made based on politics instead of data and merit.  In such organizations, the people who stay and get promoted are the ones who are the most politically savvy, not necessarily the ones who are correct/capable.  Sometimes there’s overlap.  Often, there isn&#x27;t.  Ultimately, I think we have to decide if we’re more interested in becoming good at politics or good at doing our real jobs.  Politics are supposed to be a means to an end, not the final product that a customer receives.  As such, it’s better to have people who are good at product, and it’s just a nice bonus if they’re also good at politics because politics are inevitable, especially as an organization grows.  But the focus should never be on politics primarily.<p>Note:  I&#x27;ve never worked for Microsoft, I&#x27;ve only cited their examples here because their history is so well-documented through various books and media, especially due to their monopoly trial.  I just chose the example that I thought would best get my point across.  I have worked in other large corporations where my job was to create organization-wide disruptive change.  We actually won an international award for it.  But nobody would relate to that stuff.  ;)  My thoughts are mostly taken from those experiences, Microsoft is just the vehicle to convey those thoughts.",1422289912

I&#x27;d say knowing how to code, as in going through the process of understand how to think through a logical sequence of steps, is a highly effective means of handing someone a proverbial scalpel.<p>In my experience, most people cannot break things down logically nor do they appreciate what it takes to provide clear instructions. There is an emphasis in the world on communication which is a fine start, but being able to convey an idea clearly really only becomes helpful once you understand the idea clearly.<p>Besides programmers and mathematicians, the only people I&#x27;ve met with the faculties to properly break things down are lawyers*. Law school trains you in the ability to approach an idea from different angles in order to identify attack vectors. As such, lawyers tend to be highly capable of feats of logic but are equipped in such a way that they are almost entirely adversarial and deconstructive.<p>So while I completely agree with Chris&#x27;s point and understanding that this is a banner he raises constantly, I&#x27;m a little disappointed to see him attack this initiative to get more people into coding. I&#x27;m all for better modeling tools and better teaching practices but I think teaching people to code is a wonderful solution in the interim. Framing an argument like this will only stir controversy in an otherwise worthy cause.<p>edit: I&#x27;ve met plenty of people who aren&#x27;t programmers, mathematicians, or lawyers that are logically capable. But as a general rule of thumb, those are the only three professions I&#x27;ve interacted with personally that have consistently shown that aptitude. Either way, please don&#x27;t let this personal anecdote distract from the overall message, I only left that comment in there because I wanted to emphasize how rare the ability is across most disciplines.",1422289822

For Landsat 8 data there are 11 bands and for Landsat 7 data there are 8 (if I recall correctly?).  Each band is typically distributed as an uncompressed, 16-bit tif.<p>JPEG and similar compression techniques are very effective at compression image data without losing _visual_ information.  However, it&#x27;s very important not to use lossy compression (such as JPEG) for scientific data such as this.  Our eyes may not mind, but classification algorithms do.<p>For various reasons, Landsat data is typically distributed and stored as a zip of uncompressed tiffs. The actual bit depth is often a bit lower than 16 bit (depends on the band), but it&#x27;s easiest to distribute it as 16 bit to avoid the need for unusual file formats.<p>At any rate, you can certainly compress these images quite a bit.  However, lossless compression algorithms are always at a disadvantage compared to lossy compression (e.g. JPEG).  There are plenty of more advanced lossless compression algorithms (e.g. JPEG2000 or MrSid for this exact use case) than putting uncompressed images in a zip file.  Nonetheless, they only shave ~10-20% (ballpark: it varies a lot) of the file size off compared to zip (they have other huge advantages when it comes to accessing the data, though).<p>However, the data needs to be easily used by a wide range of applications and users.  It&#x27;s easy to unzip a file and then have &quot;raw&quot; uncompressed images.  For distribution, the drop-off in usability just isn&#x27;t worth the savings in file size.

Writing Python isn&#x27;t the fundamental skill we need to teach people. Modeling systems is.<p>I think he&#x27;s missing something. Modeling is only a small part of what people learn when they learn to program. The real lesson of programming is to be able to to create models that stand up against the cold asphalt of reality.<p>They, first of all, have to be consistent enough to execute and secondly, they have to be tested with data.<p>The hurdle everyone goes through when they learn to program is the unforgiving nature of the machine - it&#x27;s not what you think you are saying that counts, it&#x27;s what you are actually saying.

Being a guy in the outskirts of Toronto, working on the project on my spare time (with two small kids), it&#x27;s pretty hard to compete w/ teams that get paid full time and get opportunities to talk at big conferences in San Francisco. I&#x27;m skeptical that this kind of gap can be made narrower with hard/good technical work alone. This reality weaves deep even into the design philosophy of Mithril: one reason the project is small is that I don&#x27;t have the resources to tech-support a huge complex one. Lack of time is obviously not a selling point, so the design of the framework itself needs to account for it - I put a lot of thought into reducing learning curve and framework complexity because that is something that both reduces my workload as a support person, and is itself a selling point (especially considering all the recent Angular criticisms).<p>I think the only reasons my project enjoys any popularity at all is the efforts I put into non-coding tasks: writing docs (took me like 2 months of writing docs nearly exclusively to get to what I consider a decent level of documentation, even despite having a tiny API), writing articles, talking to the community, getting on twitter, adding shameless plugs on HN :) etc. In a way, this is similar to being a startup founder: there&#x27;s a lot of peripheral stuff to do.

They can be fine (and are extremely common) in embedded scripting languages, but it can be far too difficult to control the size of outlier pauses when everything on the heap is subject to GC. As mentioned elsewhere in this thread, the JVM GC has had an <i>enormous</i> amount of effort put into it, and it&#x27;s still an issue that poses problems for Minecraft, et al.<p>I&#x27;m far from proving this assertion yet, but I <i>believe</i> that Go&#x27;s memory model allows for a middle way that will avoid big GC pauses. As I touch on briefly in the original post, you can use Go&#x27;s C-like value types and pointers to field/elements to avoid generating garbage for large numbers of homogenous objects (e.g., by implementing a simple pool allocator), just like you&#x27;d do in C[++] to avoid heap fragmentation.<p>I hope to get more actual data on how this works as I expand my prototype, and will do follow up posts as I learn more.",1422289027

In the late Middle Ages, when plate armour became increasingly common, people started using weapons with better armour-piercing capabilities, like maces, warhammers and various polearms.<p>Swords are great against lightly armoured and unarmoured targets, like peasants, archers and civilians. Swords remained in use as a side arm and civilian weapon, and a popular duelling weapon, which may also be why so many medieval manuscripts are about one-on-one fights. Carrying a polearm with you everywhere you go is a lot more cumbersome than having a sword hanging on your belt.<p>But swords were absolutely used on the battlefield. Romans and vikings used them a lot. Knights had them of course, and even they became increasingly less useful against other knights, they often didn&#x27;t really want to kill each other anyway. Pikemen generally had a short sword as backup weapon (the Katzbalger), and there&#x27;s of course the massive two-handed swords used by Landsknechts to break up pike formations (supposedly; nobody knows for sure). But again knights in plate armour, you&#x27;d better get something that can knock holes in it. If you want to kill him, that it.<p>You might compare the sword to a pistol. You don&#x27;t usually send a mass of soldiers into battle with just a pistol; you give them assault rifles (or polearms).

Computers just weren&#x27;t as reliable or easy to use back then. Maybe Microsoft could have made Windows better back then, maybe not. Mac System 7/8/9 was by all accounts less reliable than windows and anything &#x27;nix would have been unthinkable to a typical user.<p>So just about everyone has had a crapware infested computer running something like windows ME or Vista that crashed every few hours. For many people, the first non-widows computer they used was an android or iOS phone. Therefore the association is Microsoft == crappy/unreliable vs Apple/Google == easy to use/dependable. OEMs in a race to the bottom on hardware don&#x27;t help Microsoft at all.<p>I actually think windows 7 was a rock solid OS and Windows 8 is good once you get over the awkward interface changes.

However, if you take non-linear utility functions into account, then a fairly priced transfer of risk from a more risk-adverse party to a less risk-adverse party is a win-win situation.<p>For instance, let&#x27;s say a large institutional investor determines that a 5-yr 10-yr flattener on South Whereisitstan bonds is very attractively priced, but can&#x27;t stomach the risk of the 10-yr yield going through the roof.  They pay an investment bank to create some OTC options on the Whereisitstan 10-year notes and several medium-sized hedge funds take the other side.  If the hedge funds are right, the big institution over-pays for the options in strict dollar terms, but the options allow the institution to enter into a very attractive bond trade they otherwise would have been unwilling to enter.  In this case, everyone could win, even though the big institution takes a (both realized and statistical) loss on the options.",1382536405

This does not follow.<p>The paper describes a number (more than 2) of possible models. The main subject of the paper is probably the &quot;2-pass waterfall&quot; diagram in Figure 7. However, when people refer to this paper in the context of the Waterfall model, they mean Figure 2. The Waterfall model is called the Waterfall model because Figure 2 looks like a waterfall, with the water never flowing uphill.<p>Figure 7, however, was largely ignored. (Though Brooks later recapitulated it as &quot;Build one to throw away; you will, anyhow&quot;. I don&#x27;t know whether it was influential in the development of the Spiral model or not, though it seems like a logical progression.) As far as I know this model never even got a name attached to it. Its influence pales in comparison to Figure 2, which was the first and best published reference to a design process that almost everybody accepted as &quot;ideal&quot; at the time.<p>Note that when Brooks tells the story in <i>The Mythical Man-Month</i> about making the mistake of getting a large group of mediocre engineers to write specifications instead of giving the job to a small group of elite engineers because he didn&#x27;t want the larger group just sitting on their thumbs for a year, this was all happening in the mid 60s. Here&#x27;s another contemporary quote:<p><i>The most deadly thing in software is the concept, which almost universally seems to be followed, that you are going to specify what you are going to do, and then do it. And that is where most of our troubles come from. The projects that are called successful, have met their specifications. But those specifications were based upon the designers ignorance before they started the job.</i> Doug Ross, 1968<p>Winston Royce did <i>not</i> invent the Waterfall model in 1970, he was just describing the already-dominant paradigm as a prelude to proposing something different. The model had been around forever, Royce provided a convenient diagram (Figure 2!) in the course of trying to critique (or even replace) it, and the name &quot;Waterfall&quot; got attached later.<p>> <i>Note that, in the section referencing DoD-Std-2167, the author of the DoD standard does state explicitly that he understood Waterfall to be one-pass.</i><p>Of course he did, and he understood it correctly. The thing he didn&#x27;t understand was that it was a <i>terrible</i> idea.<p>Had he (properly) read Royce&#x27;s paper, he would have seen that it actually advocated a slightly better (but still pretty terrible) idea, but that idea was not and is not the Waterfall model. The Waterfall model is the one in Figure 2 that looks like a waterfall. Hence the name.<p>> <i>My own interpretation is contradicted further down in my comment by someone from that era (see the Larman paper linked). C&#x27;est la vie, I&#x27;m sticking with my interpretation.</i><p>Um, OK then.<p>Thanks for the link though, it was really interesting.",1382536306

Several people have pointed out some important points that are not getting enough attention in my opinion:<p>by @mcone: &quot;The procurement rules were designed for that, yes. But in real world scenarios, those rules effectively do exactly the opposite. Since there are so many hoops for potential vendors to jump through, only the most established players get to bid on most contracts.

No, they don&#x27;t receive direct compensation and thus there is no immediate conflict of interest, but the reality is humans are drawn to (or don&#x27;t want to disappoint) the people they know (former colleagues) and thus pick their old companies. In addition, they know there is a chance they may once again return to said company (so there is long term conflict of interest potential).<p>Another point that hasn&#x27;t been discussed is how the government&#x27;s procurement process provides next to no incentive for companies to efficiently produce good products. If our industry loves the DRY concept, everything about the gov procurement process points to a !DRY (or do repeat yourself). We built and rebuilt the same database for offices of the government that shared a building with one another. But because everyone is in a silo, they don&#x27;t collaborate well and don&#x27;t realize that they could pool their needs to develop more universal products. (And on the industry side, as long as gov continues to work this way, they don&#x27;t even have an incentive to re-use their work or propose innovative, generalizable solutions.)<p>And for those of you that might say, &#x27;but can&#x27;t you win a gov contract by bidding lower by working off of existing work?&#x27; The truth is price has very little to do with who gets selected for a gov contract.",1382535106

But the implementation of large systems in Android is best done in Java, for reasons of performance, modularity, and power efficiency.<p>Managed language systems exist for a reason. Dalvik bytecode is much more space efficient than native code, and Google has claimed it is about 2x as space efficient as Java bytecode, and 2x faster to interpret. Those factors reduce the need for a JIT in Android, and, until Android 2.3, Android didn&#x27;t have one, and there were plenty of ambitious, performance-sensitive Android apps.<p>The Android component architecture enables a kind of code swapping that enables large apps to fit in a single process with a limited heap size. If you are not making use of component objects, you are not being memory efficient.<p>Android&#x27;s Zygote and the use of copy-on-write goes beyond sharing pages of &quot;pure&quot; code. Any page can be shared between processes this way. This keeps global memory use down and makes it efficeint to start many more processes that would otherwise be practical with a VM language.<p>The Android base classes, Java toolchain, and runtime are the most sophisticated and efficient managed language environment for mobile devices. Ignoring them and going straight to NDK code without a specific performance case based on measurements of Android Java code performance, the effects of the JIT, and code size is a waste of time and a source of bugs that will be harder to find and fix.",1382534642

Since most of the evidence is under seal (as some of it contains trade-secret information), it&#x27;s hard to say if he found the evidence that he needed.

  that he would be able to continue working productively in 
  case of a network outage at Goldman to servers hosting 
  repositories with platform source code. The records 
  requested in Item 21 will demonstrate that shortly before 
  Aleynikov left Goldman, there was an outage that made 
  access to source code unavailable at least for several 
  hours that impacted developers productivity. This

I&#x27;m just an Entrepreneur that does not want to pay Attorney fee&#x27;s and does it all himself (with no legal background).<p>From my understanding, the recent change in the patent system (March &#x27;13) related to the &#x27;First-to-file&#x27; modification, which generally means (assuming two inventors invent the same thing at the same time), the first to file will be granted the patent. This is a change from the first to invent approach, which basically meant whoever could prove they built it first was granted the patent. From my perspective, this just means that you have to take the paperwork aspect of patents a little more seriously, and integrate it into your process at an earlier stage.<p>I did not watch this presentation, so I&#x27;m not really sure what that IP lawyer was talking about. But it sounds like it has something to do with Prior Art. The generalized concept here is that putting information into the public domain makes it &quot;known&quot;, which would then imply that it is no longer novel. This information would then become Prior Art, which in some cases could invalidate the invention from being patentable. The important thing to consider here is the documentation or record of who put the information into the public domain. If the inventor put the information into the public domain, then it would belong to the inventor, and thus considered a Publication instead of Prior Art. If someone else put the information into the public domain, then it would belong to whoever provided it, not the inventor, and thus counts as Prior Art against the inventor (and thus, not patentable by the inventor). There is a one-year grace period between the time that you disclose the information, and the time that your publication grace period expires. So my understanding from this is that it actually works in your favor to document your IP, as long as you document it properly, make sure you are recorded as the person documenting it, and you follow through within 1 year. In the example of saying it out loud in a room of people (aka co-working space), then I can understand how it might be difficult to validate and record who actually said what. When documented on paper (or what they call, a Printed Publication), then it would be much easier to validate and record who provided the information. To get more information on how to properly document IP in a Printed Publication, here are some guidelines [1]. Aside from the methods described there, you can also leverage something called a Statutory Invention Registration. This basically means you want to prevent the invention from ever being patented by anyone, so you describe the invention and officially record it with the USPTO, and then waive your right to patent it. You can read more about Statutory Invention Registration here [2].<p>Getting back to your question, if you are really concerned about someone stealing your IP, then read link [1] and use some of those methods to document your IP. You could also go through the process of actually filing an application. I don&#x27;t think just running your code constitutes as public disclosure (unless you display it on a projector up on the wall or something). A good rule of thumb is to just be careful about what you share, and whom you share it with. If you feel that it needs to be disclosed, then disclose it properly and protect yourself.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2128.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2128.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s1101.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s1101.html</a>",1382534413

6598493,comment,6596855,6597574,2,0,RogerL,,,"I always found it extremely useful to<p>1) learn to program in assembly
2) inspect the assembly generated from your compiler
3) trace a call all the way from user land down into the kernel, and back up
4) don&#x27;t forget networks. Whether that means a single wire instrumented with a &#x27;scope, or a network switch instrumented with wireshark, knowing how data gets around is important.<p>Until you can do that on your platform, you don&#x27;t really understand it (which is fine for many jobs out there, I&#x27;m just addressing the question of how to learn it).<p>I suspect the shortest and best path is to write your own (toy/emulator) assembler and compiler, and to do some embedded work with no OS. That&#x27;ll at least expose you to all the various issues; you might not implement register allocation well (or at all), but you&#x27;ll have had to think about it and the implications (example: passing function parameters on the stack vs in registers). That&#x27;s one of the advantages of a University education  to my way of thinking. You will be put through all these paces if it isn&#x27;t just a Java accreditation program.<p>There are good books documenting, say, the Windows or Linux internals, so you can gain a good understanding of things like virtual memory, device drivers and so on.<p>It is not as hard as it might seem. This is all basic information, one fact built on top of another. I have no idea how the ARM pipeline works, but that doesn&#x27;t worry me. I know what pipelines are, some of the tradeoffs they have, and if I need to get down and dirty with a cute little ARM processor I&#x27;ll know what I need to learn. You can feel sort of overwhelmed if you try to think how pressing on these keys get turned into truetype fonts on a graphical screen, and then sent across the internet to anyone bored enough to read my ramblings, while at the same time my computer updates the clock, checks my mail, and does a dozen other things, but piece by piece it is all discrete, well contained, and completely understandable.<p>Reading Stroustrup is pretty much mandatory to understand C++. I personally wouldn&#x27;t bother with the standards (other than a brief go-over); so much of the code in those slides are just things you should never, ever program. Which is to say I disagree with the slides in large measure; it&#x27;s almost suspicious to have some of that knowledge! Either your coworkers are writing truly atrocious code, or you are spending time learning corners of the language which is time that almost certainly could be better spent elsewhere, such as learning about memory mapped files or something. As others have said, knowing where the boundaries of where undefined behavior lies is important, but knowing how to avoid straying even close to that territory is far more important (always initialize variables. Even static ones! You are going to cost some sorry bastard half a day of debugging when they erroneously think the problem in the code is an uninitiated variable and keep chasing that until they finally figure it out)",1382534391

Build your business on facebook, and you might just lose 12 hours of revenue because someone else's power went out. I'd rather lose revenue because my own power went out. \n",1185908317

Home Depot will sell it to you, but no one will lend it to you, unless it is large and very expensive. <p>Worse, these sellers of stuff have realized that they can't sell you durable goods! God Forbid! Durable goods last forever! Instead, they've convinced americans that there is value in disposable stuff! Paper napkins and plates, disposable diapers, disposable tupperware, etc etc. Now they've turned those one time purchases into subscription plans. <p>More stuff in your house. More stuff in landfills. ",1185908154

I'm a fairly skeptical person, and their tricks worked on me well into my thirties.""<p>It's much easier to never get in the habit of buying things in the first place.  I remember two particular childhood events that dramatically shaped my consumption habits:<p>In the first, I was 4 years old and in the toy section of Spag's (a discount warehouse near Worcester), and <i>really</i> wanted a new Transformers toy.  My mom said ""Oh honey, we can't afford it.  We can come back next month and get it.""  And then ran over to take care of my sister, who was throwing a tantrum over not being able to have a My Little Pony doll.  I realized I could be the ""good child"" by never asking for stuff.  From then on, my parents and I had a tacit agreement: they would buy me anything I wanted, and in return I wouldn't want much.  Lesson learned: sibling rivalry can be a powerful motivator.<p>For the second - my parents refused to let us watch any TV other than PBS until they'd sat us down and told us about advertisements.  And when they did, the conversation was basically: ""The commercials are just trying to sell you something.  They want to control your behavior, so that you'll go out and buy what they want.""  I was 5 years old at the time and couldn't bear the idea of anyone controlling my behavior.  After all, it was bad enough when my parents told me what to do.  The idea that some nefarious marketing guy would reach through the TV and make me spend money was just abhorrent.  Lesson learned: make marketers seem like parents, but with only the evil ""You have to do this!"" parts and not the comforting take-care-of-you parts.<p>The end result of all this?  I'm 26 years old and still using my high school allowance for spending money.  Essentially every penny I've ever earned has gone into the bank and stayed there.",1185908004

38039,comment,38028,38028,0,0,eposts,,,"I've been practicing this minimalist form of existence for some time now. For those that have too much stuff, here is how you get rid of stuff:<p>1. Mark a portion of your basement or apartment for some of your ""stuff""<p>2. After a year or two if you have not had to use something at all from this pile get rid of it - ebay, craigslist, garage sale or donate.<p>3. You will feel good about less clutter.<p>4. Repeat till you're left with only stuff you really need.<p>The only place this hasn't worked for me is electronics ""stuff"".",1185907477
38038,comment,38028,38028,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"What about sentimental value of things? What about accumulated worth of a box of things after opening it every few years? Little overhead -- it's just a box.<p>Why save books, besides the memories? Convenience of being able to look things up? I like books, but my wifes parents are book sellers. They have hundreds of thousands of rare books for sale.<p>She doesn't like to save anything but the most essential books. <p>The mental load of throwing something away that _might_ have value is pretty high. It might be higher than the integrated attention paid to it in your basement -- unless you move often.\n",1185907418

38031,comment,38028,38028,0,0,davidw,,,"Good one! Some comments:<p>Moving across the atlantic, or to some other suitably distant locale is a great way of convincing yourself that you don't really need that much crap.  The problem gets to be when you move back and forth too much and end up getting paranoid about buying anything at all that you know you're going to throw out.  We're contemplating going back to the states again at this point...<i>sigh</i>.<p>Books... all I can say is ""right on!"".  I'm glad my wife understood when I paid a bunch of money to have mine shipped over here.<p>In terms of food, after my latest trip back to the US, I think people there are just starting to wake up to the fact that more/bigger is not necessarily better, and it will take them a while to really catch on, and start really aiming for quality.  I actually think my best business idea concerns food, but it will have to wait till we go to the states to try and implement it.",1185906537

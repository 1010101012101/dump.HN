Consulting has allowed me to work about 1/4 to 1/2 time from home, while still allocating a good amount of time to my startup.  However, I've often found myself justifying my hours to the client and am levied with more and more forms of hours documentation.<p>I'm disgusted with the whole thing. Hourly billing is hard enough because even when I'm asked to complete tasks outside of my realm of expertise, I have trouble billing for my learning curve.  On top of that, I'm working on an under-producing e-commerce site and I see the figures, I'm sure money is tight for my client.  However, I find myself disgusted, because I'm working less, doing less-than my all, because my client isn't willing to pay for the time.  To add insult to injury, the client is non-technical, so he doesn't see the value in anything but more sales.<p>Have other people run into this problem?  Is this how most hourly consulting gigs go, or is it just my client? Did you switch to project related fees?  Drop consulting for a salary job? Any advice would help.",1337043322

There is absolutely no other thing to be done when it is found but to openly and publicly FIRE the fake ""author"" who stole another person's work, and issue a public apology to the true author.<p>That would have resolved it and enabled this company to save face and appear on the up and up.<p>The handling by the CEO was so abysmal and so wrong here though that it destroyed the entire reputation of the site. His continuing to trying to spin and lie is just an embarrassment to himself, his reputation is ruined.<p>As far as whoever owns this company, at this point the only thing they could possibly do to recover at all is to fire both the CEO and the plagiarist and issue a public, heartfelt, sincere apology.",1337043239

You can buy a new CPU and place the backup, but the hardware is different, there is a shutdown moment, and when you power back, the continuity is lost, it's a different entity what gets booted up.<p>To preserve the consciousness of a person, between the ""hardware change"" I see no other option to the existence of something like a central repository of consciousness outside both the body and the computer hosting the simulation that gets automatically attached to a particular set of memories/perceptions/experiences (and whatever else defines a consciousness), so when you die, it stores your consciousness and when the simulation is booted up, the continuity is triggered.

I'm curious if you had any problems w/r/t the 3 items you highlighted above when using Mongo, as none of those were mentioned in the linked article.<p>(these points are for MongoDB 2.0+)<p>1. Adding a new shard in Mongo will cause the data to be automatically rebalanced in the background. No application-level intervention required.<p>2. Node failure (primary in a RS) is handled without intervention by the rest of the nodes in the cluster. Network partitions can be handled depending on what the value set for 'w' is (in practice it's not an isolated problem with a specific solution).<p>3. Using mongos abstracts the need to know what node any data is on as each mongos keeps an updated hash of the shard keys. Queries will be sent directly to the node with the requested data.",1337043205

Quicktime X is pushing towards hardware acceleration, better battery life (with a few tricks), and multicore processing that the old model just doesn't work with.<p>Right now when you run older codecs, Quicktime X actually runs a little host process in 32bit that actually does the decoding using a fork of the old Quicktime 7 code.

This puts a certain pressure on node loss situations that I find is very similar to traditional RDBMS.)<p>But of your list, I have done all of these things in a MySQL system and for a comparable 1000 lines of code.<p>1. We implemented a system that tracks which servers are part of a ""role"" and the weights assigned to that relationship.

Node failure is easy given the above: set weight=0. This assumes a master/slave setup with many slaves. If you lose a master, it's slightly more complicated but you can do slave promotion easily enough: it's well enough understood. (And if you use a Doozer/Zookeeper central config/locking system, all of your users get notified of the change in milliseconds. It's very reliable.)<p>Network partitions are hard to deal with for most applications more so than most databases. It is worth noting that in Riak, if you partition off nodes, you might not have all data available. Sure, eventual consistency means that you can still write to the nodes and be assured that eventually the data will get through, but this is a very explicit tradeoff you make. ""My data may be entirely unavailable for reading, but I can still write something to somewhere."" IMO it's a rare application that can continue to run without being able to read real data from the database.<p>3. In a master/slave MySQL environment you would be reading from the slaves anyway unless your tolerance for data freshness is such that you cannot allow yourself to read slightly stale data. I.e., payment systems for banks or things that would fit better in a master/master environment. Since the slaves are all in sync, broadly speaking, you can read from any of them. (But you should use the weighted random as mentioned in the first point.)<p>...<p>Please also note that I am not trying to knock Riak. It's neat, it's cool, it does a great job. It's just a different system with a different set of priorities and tradeoffs that may or may not work in your particular application. :)<p>But to say that it can do things the others can't is incorrect. Riak requires you to have lots of organizational knowledge about siblings and conflict resolution in addition to the operational knowledge you need. A similar MySQL system requires you to have a different set of knowledge -- how to design schemas, how to handle replication, load balancing, etc.<p>Is one inherently better than the other? I don't think so. :)",1337041109

I absolutely love Perian and it has made it much easier to just play content without having to download VLC as well, and it just worked.<p>One thing I have noticed is that support for MKV/VP8/WebM has always been pretty bad. It uses a LOT of CPU time and in general was really slow. When YouTube put me in the HTML 5 beta it was unbeknownst to me sending me WebM content because I had Perian installed and it was causing HUGE spikes in CPU usage and overall lag because it was trying to decode and render WebM, whereas h264 requires almost no CPU power on my older MBP.<p>I hope that the community as a whole picks up the project and helps it succeed, it would be fantastic to still have it around.",1337040009

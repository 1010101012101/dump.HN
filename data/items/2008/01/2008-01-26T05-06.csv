104533,comment,104482,104516,0,0,chaostheory,,,"that's a good point<p>It does remind me of an old study of alcoholics in the military (I can't reference it), specifically a study of the best way to treat them. In this study some of the patients were 'forced' to take pills that would make them feel really uncomfortable when they drank any alcohol. I could be wrong, but I think these patients were the only ones who recovered or came closest to recovering...",1201326304

104531,comment,104226,104420,0,0,gruseom,,,"Fair enough. He also disabled run permissions on the script. But my point isn't really about ""just comments"", it's that good programmers take responsibility for failures that arise from their work. In this case, printing ""DO NOT EVER RUN THIS SCRIPT"" and exiting without doing anything led to misunderstanding and problems in the hands of a curious and inexperienced successor. Here the author had a choice to make. He could look at how his rather hokey strategy contributed to the failure or he could hype up the stupidity of the other guy.",1201325861

In a very pasionate way I <i>need</i> to do this.  I'm tired of wasting my time and efforts in a corporate environment.<p>I can get more done in a day on my code than I can in a month of day job work.  Also, (at least in the initial stages) I can structure my work in efficient manner so that I'm accomplishing more and more every hour I spend working.",1201325519

I used it a few years ago to process all of the hardware data sheets on the Cisco website and extract 13 parameters such as height, width, depth, weight, power consumption (AC and DC), etc...Because Cisco's products come from many different acquisitions the datasheets were in many different formats, which sounds similar to your problem.<p>One point I would make is that a fast crawler is not always the best for this type of application: crawling at about the speed a user would click on pages is more friendly to a site and less likely to have them take steps to block your access.",1201325143

Obviously ""making a bunch of money playing poker"" qualifies one as an expert in rapidly assigning probabilities of success to ventures undertaken in an increasingly complex world where the law of unintended consequences seems to be trumping everything else.<p>>> and his current startup has obvious money making potential<p>And is worth $0.  Contrasted with, say, Google ... which until year 3 had no clue as to what their business model would be and therefore had, using your logic, no ""obvious money making potential"" ... but is now worth ... like, a lot - or so I hear.<p>If ideas are a dime a dozen then ""potential"" must be the stuff they use for shipping filler to make sure the ideas don't get damaged during transport.<p>In other words, he is no more proven than the people whose startups he belittles ...",1201324603

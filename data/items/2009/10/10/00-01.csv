They're called processes in erlang, but they're M:N scheduled threads.<p><i>So on a four-core system, you might have one thousands of Erlang lightweight processes running on just four OS threads in one OS process.</i><p>Or you could have thousands of Erlang lightweight processes mapped to 185 OS threads (not that it will, but it could). The fact that they're green threads is irrelevant in terms of scalability -- they're still threads, but even less resource intensive than a direct mapping to OS threads. M:N scheduled green threading is also very hard to do in the general case, which is why you don't see more of it (see the abandoned attempts to implement generic M:N OS:green thread scheduling in FreeBSD, for instance).<p>You could also be using Scala, where an actor only maps to a thread when it's blocked inside of its react loop, but in that case will consume a whole thread.<p>What's your point? :)",1255133141

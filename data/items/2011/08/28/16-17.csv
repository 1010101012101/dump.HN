My issue isn't about the quality or accuracy of the facts, but it's about curation of the facts to grab what matters and put it into an efficient and coherent story.  Without the effort of quality journalists on the ground, I'm forced to try to curate all that myself, which is <i>very</i> time consuming, or rely on someone else who is equally removed from the subject to curate it for me, which is pretty much journalism anyway (except they might miss something they wouldn't if they were on the ground).  I know few people with that much time.  I certainly don't have it.  :(",1314550683

2934307,comment,2934042,2934042,18,0,wglb,,,"One reason that I know of is that you can get better performance.<p>Now I know that there are claims that C# and Java are performance competitive with C++. You see some of that in the benchmark game at <a href=""http://shootout.alioth.debian.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org</a> for simple problems a wide variety of results.  One interesting one, the n-body problem, which involves a lot of hard-core computation, is the winner C++ or Java or .net?  Well, <a href=""http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/performance.php?test=nbody"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/performance.php?test=n...</a> says that the winner is . . . Fortran!!  (Not my favorite language either). g++ comes out at a factor of 1.3, the best Java at 1.5, and the best C# comes out at 2.1. That is, it takes the best C# program 2.1 times as long to compute this problem than the fastest program.<p>The stackexchange post said <i>But in this era, the performance of a program written in a language based on frameworks such as C# and Java can be pretty close to that of C++</i> A factor of 1.6 is not pretty close, in my book.  If you are in high speed markets and all other things being equal, placing your order at 1.6 ms when the other guy places it at 1.0 ms means what?  It means you are further down in the order book. You lose.<p>So we all know that these toy benchmarks don't really represent what happens in a large, useful program. It would be interesting to build a more extensive benchmark set, don't you think?<p>Having worked on a very high-performance stock options feed, I can share some of my experience.  The development goes something like this.  You start out in C++, cause you get objects, and other useful stuff.  You see that during peaks of the day, say around 0900 cst that you are beginning to fall behind.  So you begin to tune.<p>See, lots of people decry the C++/C combination saying that they are different languages.  Well, sort of. If you are on a theoretical or dogmatic bent, sure.  But if you have a C++ program that is taking too long, you can relatively easily, bit-by-bit, turn it into a C program. So I am fine with the C/C++ designation in practice.<p>You tune this thing, making sure that you allocate your objects, say, at 0829 in the day and tend to leave them there until 1500. Then you up the -O count, hoping you are not pulling a Heisenberg.  If you still need a little headroom, you learn that you can turn off exceptions in g++. Yes, even thought you don't ever throw an exception, having that not disabled costs you CPU. (What were they thinking?).  So while the compile flags and the source program extension says C++, what you are executing more closely resembles C.<p>But there are those who fervently say that in such an environment that Java is competitive with C/C++.  If you look at the cost to build the program, I am likely to agree that that part of the effort is faster with Java.  But can you tune Java as much as C++? Or .net?  I am suspecting not.<p>I think we should have a more broad-based real-life example.  I am thinking that a simulated financial exchange repeatedly implemented in competing languages might be a more interesting example.  In fact, I think I will go off and give that a try.  Say maybe Lisp (note that it whips Java server in some examples, take that!), Java, C++ and certainly not Fortran (due to personal prejudices).<p>I'll let you know how that turns out.",1314550608

And indeed, they just use the SHA256 of the passphrase to seed a PRNG.<p>They claim that a PublicKeyID ""can be used to uniquely identify Sam's public key"".  Fingerprints help identify keys more easily, but certainly not ""uniquely"" since they don't have as many bits as the key; pigeonhole principle.<p>Worse, the PublicKeyID uses MD5.<p>They use a public exponent of 3, rather than the usual 65537 or larger.

The scenarios where you're doing OLS analysis can generally be broken in to two categories:<p>1) Exploration of a given data set.<p>2) Automatic collection and analysis of data.<p>In most academic uses of data (1) is the case. Here, if the data is already rectangular, and in a nice format, I would actually prefer Stata. However, as soon as any sort of manipulation is required, or graphing something more difficult than a scatterplot is required I shift to R.<p>R really shines through when you need to do complicated analysis on a fixed data set. I've found that Hadely Wickham's `reshape` and `ggplot` packages are invaluable. They <i>easily</i> produce graphics that are more informative and better looking than any other graphics package I've seen. Additionally R has packages for essentially any statistical analysis that you could want to do.<p>While R is able to pull data from a database, or other places, as soon as you have more dynamic data, you enter into case (2).

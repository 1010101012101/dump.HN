It&#x27;s a very diverse industry.<p>I hope that Kink implodes.  That side of the industry started as an almost joke.  Bush, pre-911 Bush, talked about going after violent porn.  So a couple producers got together and said: &quot;Well, lets give them a target.&quot;  They had first amendment lawyers primed for battle.  Then 9/11, and the feds never showed up.  Fast forwards a decade or so, and the violent porn meant to trigger a freedom of speech battle is practically mainstream.  Kink.com is now a giant and customers are leaving for content that even Kink wouldn&#x27;t touch.  The old hats are aghast at the beast they&#x27;ve unleashed.<p>I&#x27;ve got clients that come to me when employees are caught downloading things they shouldn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m the guy that has to go through this material and figure out whether anything is illegal, whether we have to bring in the cops.  It isn&#x27;t fun.<p>(But i did once practically fall out of my chair at a client meeting when I was introduced as &quot;the external expert on child porn&quot;.

ISTM that in international relations things tend to either muddle along rather badly with gradual incremental improvements that roughly track economic growth, but when they go bad (ie resulting in war or massive political change) they tend to do so quickly and catastrophically (in the sense of a major discontinuity rather than mere badness, although more often than not it&#x27;s bad).<p>And while I share your reservations about the US as a global hyperpower whose policing of international relations can frequently result in backlash (not unlike its internal policing culture...)

It is easier then ever to make rational decisions thanks to all that information and accumulated insight, and I do think the US is maturing as a society. But there&#x27;s an argument that irrational political behavior is rationally rewarding for voters who know they have very little influence over the political process and take their vote as an opportunity to express their disgruntlement through perversity.

Its share of the budget is not even that big in the grand scheme of things. For example, subsidized loans the government/BNDES gives to large business (who coincidentally happen to be campaign contributors) are responsible for a bigger hole in the budget than the bolsa família.<p>Also, the reason we had to rename the currency last time was because Brazil had suffered from hyperinflation for so many decades that even after the government stopped printing money prices kept goingup out of sheer inertia. To give an idea, most supermarkets hired a person that would go around the aisles restickering things and mindlessly bumping prices by 2% every day.<p>Nowadays the government again has gone back to the times of a screwed up monetary policy but we are still far away from hyperinflation.",1444959200

You could argue that you live long enough to reproduce and that reproduction is the basic, biological purpose of life for all organisms. So, if someone is unattractive, just create a Basic Reproduction Guarantee. The same reasoning used for redistributing money could be used for redistributing sex. Since Basic Income is not considered stealing, then Basic Reproduction should not be considered rape.<p>The term &quot;basic&quot; income is stupid, and should not be used. What is basic is being able to live in reasonable conditions. As it stands, the only way to do that reliably right now is to have a guaranteed income. Sex is not necessary for you to survive.
And contrary to what you might think, no, basic income is not stealing. Taxes are not stealing. That&#x27;s part of living in a society. If you wish to not have things stolen from you, I highly recommend going to live in a remote part of the world, where noone will prevent you from doing your job.

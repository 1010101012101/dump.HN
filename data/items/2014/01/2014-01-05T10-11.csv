Unless, of course, the marijuana is &quot;open to public view&quot; (after the police officer demands you show it to him), or you have &quot;contraband&quot; (a joint), or its not your first rodeo, etc.<p>Which is why New York City is the marijuana arrest capital of the world, at over 40,000 arrests per year (for small amounts), with the lowest-level misdemeanor pot possession arrests accounting for over 10% of all arrests:<p><a href=\"http://www.alternet.org/story/141866/the_epidemic_of_pot_arrests_in_new_york_city?paging=off\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.alternet.org/story/141866/the_epidemic_of_pot_arr...</a><p>My favorite quote? &quot;And for cooperating with the police, the young people are handcuffed and jailed.&quot;",1388918445

In that scenario, his responses should be considered rational.<p>How many people <i>really</i> have a rational attitude towards radiation?  Think of all the movies, tv, books that have been produced in the last 50 years that have completely irrational views toward radiation.  How many times have you heard that a nuclear bomb would make a city uninhabitable for x,0000 years, completely oblivious to the existence of the thriving city of Hiroshima.<p>The truth is that no government could possibly keep a lid on something like this.   Idnependent testing and independent broadcasting all exist, so any real threat would be known quickly.<p>The truth is radiation is a very dangerous thing, but, like anything, it all depends on the dose.",1388917932
7015258,comment,7011903,7012922,1,0,Natsu,,,"> This article has no mention of bioaccumulation.<p>The article does mention that most fish (other than tuna) don&#x27;t migrate anywhere.  In order for bioaccumulation to happen, they must absorb contamination faster than they excrete it (the so-called &#x27;biological half-life&#x27;).  As the contamination drops to near-background radiation not very far from Japan, it&#x27;s difficult to see how this could be a threat for fish that are not near the contaminated area as there simply won&#x27;t be a source of contamination for them to absorb that&#x27;s significantly different from the natural background radiation.<p>That said, I have a simple way of avoiding this:  I don&#x27;t like fish and I never eat any :)  I do, however, enjoy tasty, naturally-radioactive bananas all the time, so it balances out.",1388917696

7015232,comment,7015133,7015186,1,0,anujkk,,,"By hardware hacking I mean being able to solve problems by not just using code but also hardware. For example, what if I want all lights of my home to automatically switch off if sufficient day light is available? Problems like these can&#x27;t be solved by just code.<p>It isn&#x27;t about writing low-level code. Actually, I would just prefer to use a high level language like python if possible or in worst case C. It isn&#x27;t about creating actual hardware like microprocessors but using existing hardware/software to solve real world problems.",1388916554

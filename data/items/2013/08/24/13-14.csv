Please hop on IRC freenode #salt if you have questions, we&#x27;re a pretty friendly community.<p>As far as other tools, I use and love cobbler quite a bit, but for Ubuntu support, you need a fairly new version. Also ask on #cobbler if you&#x27;re having problems. The cobbler community is healthy, but not nearly as large or active as the salt community. A few other nice tools would be collins[1] and graphite[2]. If you use OpenStack horizon, it is using graphite under the covers. Disclaimer: I&#x27;m also a developer / co-maintainer of graphite. You can join us on #graphite via IRC on FreeNode. The graphite project just released 0.9.12 and is about to start moving forward much faster. For metrics collection... I&#x27;d suggest collectd[3] with the write_graphite plugin <i>or</i> diamond[4].<p>Same as here, I&#x27;m SEJeff on IRC.<p>[1] <a href=""http://tumblr.github.io/collins/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tumblr.github.io/collins/</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://github.com/graphite-project"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/graphite-project</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://collectd.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://collectd.org/</a>\n[4] <a href=""https://github.com/BrightcoveOS/Diamond/wiki"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/BrightcoveOS/Diamond/wiki</a>",1377352768

It&#x27;s called a 360 review: your employees that report under you, co-workers at the same management level and your managers all rate you. The reviews are bell curved and the worst performers are asked to leave. It just so happens that Goldman Sachs has some of the smartest and people on Wall Street. I think it says a lot because a ton of &quot;failed&quot; Wall Streeters leave and completely destroy the perspective industry they go into afterwards.

6268577,comment,6266863,6266863,13,0,rayiner,,,"This bit stuck out for me: &quot;For that reason, executives said, a lot of Microsoft superstars did everything they could to avoid working alongside other top-notch developers, out of fear that they would be hurt in the rankings. And the reviews had real-world consequences: those at the top received bonuses and promotions; those at the bottom usually received no cash or were shown the door.&quot;<p>Individualized bonus/compensation decisions have no place in environments where the work is heavily or totally team-oriented. It forces people into a mode where they focus on getting the most individual credit instead of making the product as successful as possible. That general incentive exists in any team-setting, of course, but when you grade everyone on a curve like that and tie compensation/job retention to it, you really force everyone into playing that game.<p>By way of contrast, look at how investment banks do bonuses. If you&#x27;re in IBD, your bonus is usually based on the success of your deal teams. If you&#x27;re in S&T, your bonus is usually based on the success of your desk. Even further in that direction is how many law firms handle compensation: everyone is paid in strict lock-step. The end-result of these models is that nobody has an incentive, at least a purely monetary incentive, to jockey for credit. The way to make more money is to have the project be successful, and that means doing your best to cooperate with your teammates.<p>Sometimes you&#x27;re forced to pay individualized bonuses. It might be the only way of attracting the superstar that would otherwise be able to make a lot more money elsewhere. But Microsoft has very high hiring standards and is rolling in cash.

A forward looking failure, seeing as they&#x27;re missing out on the hottest categories of &quot;new things&quot; while e.g. old competitor Apple is succeeding despite also having the drag of a legacy PC system.<p>But, yeah, as I note below, &quot;<i>A billion here, a billion there, pretty soon, you&#x27;re talking real money.</i>&quot; (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Dirksen"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Dirksen</a>).",1377349442

PHP suddenly made that trivial. PHP was basically a new language with a stdlib for web programming. It was enjoyable to work with, and it took off.<p>Circa 2004, the hardest part of web programming was managing the DB from the app code (migrations,ORM), quickly accessing the prolific output of the OSS community (RubyGems), and having some sane organizing principles around building apps (opinionated MVC).<p>In 2004 I had the same problems in my PHP apps. I had just come off of 2 years of Cocoa development and couldn&#x27;t stand doing PHP the &quot;old&quot; way. It was too painful. I ended up porting the Cocoa framework to PHP so that I&#x27;d have a sane way of building apps. I later discovered ruby/rails, but frankly at that time it was less mature than my framework so I didn&#x27;t jump.<p>As someone stuck in PHP land, I was frustrated by the relative lack of progress in the PHP community vs Ruby, but I was never really enamored with Ruby the language. It&#x27;s powerful, and easy to read, but frankly I felt that power would eventually work against it. As the less-savvy developers moved to it, the quality of the code would greatly diminish. I feel that this has happened.<p>I do use a lot of Ruby projects as well, and it&#x27;s rare that I don&#x27;t run into critical bugs almost immediately. For as many nice things as there are about ruby, I find it very difficult to debug, and the broad application of metaprogramming, mixins, and other language tricks ends up delivering apps that have highly coupled state that fail in unpredictable, hard to debug ways. Javascript has the same problem. Frankly I don&#x27;t think the ruby community is producing code of better quality than the php community at this point. There is great stuff that we can finally easily share thanks to composer.<p>Metaprogramming & dynamism are neat ideas but I just don&#x27;t think it scales well with the constructs that those languages have. PHP 5.4 has traits which are really nice for this type of thing, and Scala&#x27;s traits are even nicer. The point being that other languages can deliver that flexibility without becoming unmanageable, and I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a path to that with Ruby or Javascript.<p>IMO, I think languages like Ruby and Javascript will actually WANE in the far future as new languages come along with better constructs for empowering developers with dynamism that can be better managed and have faster runtime performance. I think Ruby will end up as a frowned-upon language with crap libraries and Javascript will more and more just be used as a build target.",1377349300
6268525,comment,6266863,6268032,3,0,tytso,,,"You are assuming that monetary compensation is the only motivator for employees.   And that&#x27;s simply not true.  Once people have enough that they can feed their family and put their kids through college, money isn&#x27;t as important a motivator.  So while you do want to reward your superstars, it follows that (a) the fact that lower performing employees get paid less may not be so much of a problem, so long as they are adequately paid (i.e., not &quot;peanuts&quot;), and (b) money may not necessarily be the best way to do this --- you need to make sure that their good work is recognized, and you need to take into account what they want to work on.<p>At the end of the day, it&#x27;s going to be the other things; a fun/pleasant workplace, development tools that don&#x27;t suck, a collegial environment, which are going to be more important for most employees once their basic needs are met.<p>Perhaps in a startup environment, where hours are long and the pressure to ship trumps everything else, people forget about these things and think only about the compensation which will hopefully be coming over the horizen in case the startup makes a successful exit.  But in a more mature company, I&#x27;ll suggest that an attitude like that is extremely short-sighted.",1377349251

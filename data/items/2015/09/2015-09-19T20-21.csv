I think viewing Stan as a better BUGS is helpful but limiting.<p>The syntax is similar, but the class of models Stan fits is far more general. The class of algorithms we have available also goes beyond MCMC, e.g., variational inference, optimization, and interfaces to Stan exist on all primary programming languages. It&#x27;s more helpful to think of Stan as its own probabilistic programming language, and arguably the biggest entity with the largest user base.",1442696247

However, I was kind of surprised to see the author list interpretability as one of the drawbacks of random forests:<p>> Another point that some might find a concern is that random forest models are black boxes that are very hard to interpret.<p>I generally agree that random forests are more difficult to interpret than linear models such as logistic regression, but I think they&#x27;re still far more interpretable than more comparable non-linear models such as neural networks or SVMs with non-linear kernels. At the end of the day, a random forest is just a bunch of decision trees, each of which are very straightforward for humans to understand. Additionally, there are a number of straightforward methods available for assessing the importance of each individual feature in a random forest in aggregate ([1], section 15.4). Neural networks, on the other hand, result in models that are too cryptic to be meaningfully inspected by a human, and have more complex variable importance measures [2].<p>The relative interpretability of these non-linear models played a large factor in our decision to add random forests to our modeling stack at Sift Science, which you can read more about here: <a href=""http://blog.siftscience.com/blog/2015/large-scale-decision-forests-lessons-learned"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.siftscience.com/blog/2015/large-scale-decision-f...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.massey.ac.nz/~mkjoy/pdf/Olden,Joy&DeathEM.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.massey.ac.nz/~mkjoy/pdf/Olden,Joy&DeathEM.pdf</a>",1442695881

Happy to be corrected here).<p>Relativity is, like quantum mechanics, a fairly simple concept with incredibly complex implications and edge cases.<p>The easiest intuitive explanation of relative time I have found is the following:<p>- Assume our space time/universe is a 4D vector space. Three spatial dimensions, one time.<p>- Everything has a 4D vector which describes movement through this 4D space-time {x, y, z, t}<p>- The length/magnitude of this vector is fixed at the speed of light, c<p>- Normalize the dimensions of our 4D space as following: if we are not moving at all (x = y = z = 0) the vector points entirely in time our vector is {0, 0, 0, c} and, in our frame of reference, time moves as normal - &quot;one second per second&quot;.<p>- Now, as we go faster and faster this vector no longer points purely in time. In the extreme case where the vector sum of the x, y, z (3D spatial component) is c, the time component t will be zero. This is why our photon does not experience time passing - it moves through space at c, so cannot move through time at all.<p>For the 3D velocities we normally experience we do not move in space fast enough to affect motion through time appreciably. Even the GPS corrections for relativity mostly arise due to Earth&#x27;s gravity well distorting local space-time geometry, although their high velocity does contribute.<p>Objects with mass cannot be accelerated to c under our current understanding of relativity because kinetic energy diverges (approximately 1/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2)) - reaching speed of light would require infinite energy.",1442694881

You have an abstract matrix multiplication algebra which needs to be converted into a deterministic algorithm with a known order of operations.  You need a second algorithm, essentially a macro, which converts the abstract operation into the concrete operations, which are then compiled to deterministic code.<p>This macro should itself be deterministic, even if its inputs contain information about local hardware configuration that&#x27;s needed to make the optimized code run as fast as possible.  If this information is in your data set, it&#x27;s in your data set.  Optimization is typically much less important to the reproduction pass, so a reproduction will probably just use your configuration details rather than those matched to the reproducer&#x27;s machine.<p>Either way, both algorithms are deterministic and the result is reproducible.

Which is that &quot;normal&quot; ranges of almost every metric on the human body are not well defined lines. Rather, they describe a bell curve or measurements, such that 6% of the population will just naturally fall out of the &quot;normal&quot; ranges. So a number that is 5, 10, even 50% beyond normal does not necessarily indicate a problem. Not in the slightest. It could very well just be normal variations between humans. But people searching for answers tend get a laser focus on such things, thinking they have found the clue that will lead them to an answer. Most of the time, they have not.<p>And we who search for answers also hear the stories of others like us, spending years trying to get a diagnosis, who did find the one clue, and did follow that to a diagnosis and treatment, which turned out to be correct. But those stories are outliers. Most of the time, we are wrong.<p>Doctors know the numbers. They know that for every 100 people in our situation, 99% of them will have the common answers, and that why they treat us the way they do, and give us the advice they do.<p>But in this author&#x27;s case, he had someone drill a hole in his brother&#x27;s head. I&#x27;m not going to judge that decision, there are days I would try some pretty extreme things myself. But I can absolutely understand why doctors would not be jumping up to perform that procedure. And at the end of the day, it did not change his brother&#x27;s condition.<p>In my mind, that is the real point of this story. Most of our own medical theories coming from our internet research are wrong. Not all. And I absolutely do not want to discourage people from seeking answers. You do need to be your own advocate in today&#x27;s world. But I also have to believe that if you are asking for medical procedures and multiple doctors are turning you down, it is worth listening to their reasons.<p>EDIT: Yes, I stated the procedure incorrectly.

SELLs... is that when  augmented  by a  library,  a  general-purpose language can  be  about  as  expressive  as  a  special-purpose  language and by subsetting that extended language, a tool can provide about as good semantic guarantees.  Such guarantees can be used to provide better code, better representations, and more sophisticated transformations than would be possible for the full base language. For example, we can provide support for parallel operations on containers as a library.   We can  then analyze  the  program  to  ensure  that  no  undesirable  access to elements of those containers  occurs — a  task that  could be simplified by enforcing a ban of languages features that happened to be undesirable in this context.  Finally we can perform high-level transformations (such as parallelizing) by taking advantage of the known semantics of the libraries.&quot;",1442693787

It&#x27;s not impossible to bring it 100% server-side and serve the final page as a mix of content + ads. This is effectively what happens with native apps already and there&#x27;s an increasing amount of sponsored content. Content consumption is way up with billions of ad clicks, video plays and articles read everyday. The ad industry is stronger than ever.<p>3) Blame for the current situation is shared by all. Publishers should have better standards. Ad networks should use better formats and engineering. Advertisers should buy better stuff and know where/what is actually running. Just follow the money - buyers > networks > pubs with about a dozen layers in the middle, everyone trying to make the people who pay them happy. Users are not in this chain unfortunately.<p>4) Payments are not a magical solution. Most people do not want to pay, even if you might and the web is too granular for site-specific subscriptions which requires a scalable 3rd party. This is VERY hard to do considering the mechanics of the internet but there are things in the works like Google&#x27;s Contributor program. Sadly results have NOT been great because any amount of money adds friction and most editorial/news content does not provide replay value like a music track would, but there is promise with network scale, bundling and the option to choose the level of ads/payment involved as your browse.<p>5) Browsing via ads is far more anonymous than payments, which involve credit cards which means name, address, birthdays, purchase history, credit history, etc. Contrary to lot of FUD, ad networks usually rely on 3rd party companies for data and they mostly focus on wide demographics and interests. If you&#x27;re worried about privacy, then look at Google and Facebook who are both the de facto leaders in adtech primarily because of all the data users willing give them. Those are the companies that know who you really are on every device.<p>6) Finally I just want to say that the industry is not stupid or clueless, it&#x27;s just massive (150B+) with lots of politics and back-room deals. Any industry this size usually takes years or decades to adapt and there&#x27;s still a lot to figure out so change will be slow but ultimately the old guard will be retired and better stuff will come along. It&#x27;s accelerating now so that&#x27;s a good sign. I know everyone thinks they can do better with some brilliant idea and flip things around instantly but it&#x27;s just not that simple. Please remember there are plenty of smart, talented, hard-working people (just like you!) that are working on this. I promise we will figure it out.",1442692910

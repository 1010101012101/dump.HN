10031720,comment,10031286,10031286,0,0,a3_nm,,,"It is also interesting that there are many parallels between software engineering and the design of mathematical proofs (or theoretical CS proofs, which I am more familiar with).<p>In theoretical CS, people talk of catching and fixing &quot;bugs&quot; in proofs, namely, mistakes that make the proof fail but can hopefully be fixed while sticking to essentially the same idea.<p>One can &quot;refactor&quot; proofs, in superficial ways (e.g., renaming of concepts), but in deeper ways also, e.g., extract part of a proof to make it an independent lemma that you can reuse (or &quot;invoke&quot;) from other parts of the proof. One often tries to &quot;decouple&quot; large proofs into independent parts with clearly defined &quot;interfaces&quot;, that the reader can understand separately from each other, though this usually implies a tradeoff (a more tightly integrated proof requires more mental space but is usually shorter overall).<p>One can think of the statement of sub-results (lemmas) as providing an &quot;interface&quot; to invoke them elsewhere, which you try to &quot;decouple&quot; from the actual &quot;implementation&quot;, namely, the way the lemmas are really proven. It takes practice to find the right way to abstract away the essence of a result to state it correctly, without burdening it with implementation details, but without forgetting an important aspect of the result that will be necessary later. As in software engineering, once a result is proven, you stop burdening your mind with the implementation and mostly think about the statement (i.e., what the result is supposed to be doing) when using it.<p>In software engineering, one must decide which part of the code is &quot;responsible&quot; for checking certain properties on the objects, and that code may &quot;assume&quot; some preconditions on its inputs and must &quot;guarantee&quot; some preconditions on its outputs. In the same way, in proofs, one often wonders where certain conditions should be verified. Should they be part of the definition of the object? Does this lemma enforce more conditions on the object than what is guaranteed by its statement?<p>The parallel is not perfect. In software engineering, you can rely on the computer to check that your code is correct, and to execute it. In mathematics you rely on other humans to do this and check that they are convinced by your proofs. This means you can get away with appeals to human intuition which are not fully formal, but on the other hand there is no safety net when you make an error in your reasoning, no reality check that you can invoke to avoid exploring erroneous consequences. Also, this does not apply to all types of proofs; but it applies especially well to proofs that describe a construction, i.e., a way to &quot;build&quot; a certain abstract object, often to justify that an object with a certain desirable set of properties exists.",1439157396

There were several classes I took as a junior with a lot of freshmen.<p>* If you are talking about the option to get into a prestigious school, the people you meet there are potential connections that can accelerate your career at various points.

This has pros (consistency and flexibility) and cons (they stand out as looking non-native.)<p>I&#x27;ve strongly considered a raster-based backend to my toolkit as well (for things like running apps directly on a framebuffer, or what have you), but have held off so far because it&#x27;s undoubtedly a massive undertaking.

I have a house 4 minutes from Pile and have some good friends from there.<p>I spent the past 7 years in those exact villages on the coast, including Pile: El Aromo, Liguiqui, San Lorenzo, Las Piñas, El Abra, Santa Rosa, San Pedro 6, and finally Pile (in order of their distance from Manta along the highway).<p>The article is correct that the finest Panama hats are not made in Montecristi, but in Pile (although there were a good number of weavers in El Aromo as well, more picked-over by the dealers).<p>One thing the article doesn&#x27;t mention are the occasional abortive attempts to collectivize, and to wrest some degree of control away from the dealers and towards the hat producers. Pile, for instance, recently built a pretty little hat museum, and tours of mostly European/US tourists are brought through from time to time to take pictures and see where the hats are made.<p>But the gulf between the dealers and the weavers is enormous. Most weavers, when they move upwards ... move out of weaving. For instance, the coastal fishing economy is going through really hard times at the moment, but even so a fisherman can make 2 or 3x what a weaver does. Even someone doing machete work will probably net more per month than a weaver. Which is why most of the weavers in terms of volume are probably women; little old ladies with sunken chests from leaning on the rounded stone that holds the work in place.",1439154473

1110076,comment,1108392,1108608,0,0,JangoSteve,,,"I tend to get cavities every now and then, but always have very little plaque build-up. In fact, when I went on one 4-year hiatus from the dentist, the assistant cleaning my teeth said it looked like I had just recently had them cleaned. She said it probably had to do with the chemical makeup of my saliva being more plaque-resistant that average. Funny thing is my mom always gets similar comments when she goes to the dentist. We live very far away from each other and have very different diets. Based on that, I would conclude that the bacterial ecology of the mouth and related chemical composition of saliva, are probably quite genetic.<p>Also, based on the fact that my dad has horrible luck with his teeth (cavities, root canals, etc), and dminor's comment (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1108895"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1108895</a>) in this thread saying that they have very different luck with their teeth from their brother, I would venture to guess that it may have a lot to do with the mother's side of the genetics (being linked to the X chromosome that gets passed down). In dminor's case, they could have received one X from their mother and their brother have received genetic makeup from the other X, which could explain their differences in dental hygiene at least partially. If it were Y-linked, then I'd obviously have much closer luck to my dad's, and those two brothers would be much closer in results to each other, since there is only one Y to be given from one parent.<p>Of course, this is all nothing more than educated conjecture. I'm probably totally off base and it's likely much more complicated than that. For all I know, these results could be all coincidence, and the genetic characteristics could be totally unrelated to the sex-giving genes. (In other words, I have no dental training and nothing more than a curious, inquisitive disposition.)",1265648188

You can always buck the prevailing culture and be a black swan, but you have to look at the risks and benefits of swimming that way.<p>And many more folks than me buy in. Many are heavily invested in perpetuating this model because it gives them a level of perceived (rather than actual) control - if they aren't actually forming the startups, and they need a set of ways to evaluate potential success, than overwork may be one of those obtainable metrics you can check off relatively easily.<p>This means the sausage grinder may always be a sausage grinder no matter the tinge of the sausage coming out on the other end. I have no idea how to go about fixing this other than to begin not by continuing to bitch about work/life balance but to begin to fix my own equation (intrinsic - what are my goals? How will I reach them?) and others (extrinsic - are there talented groups out there who aren't getting a shot because we aren't telling women they can strut in and say ""fuck it, fund me?"").<p>I figured I'd start with a more open solution where women are informed about the risks and returns by those who've been there.

But, beyond that, it's a very good article with some very important information contained within.  We are approaching a point where neuroscience is getting good enough that we will finally be able to abandon the non-objective ""social"" sciences for actual science, and have a much better chance of approaching the truth.<p>I fear that the main point of the paper discussed might end up being largely ignored, however.  This would certainly not be the first time where it has been shown that a certain level of 'accepted' evidence is simply not objectively true, but a large portion of the community continues to rely on it simply because finding the truth is difficult.  The real problem comes when this sloppy research is used to drive public policy.  Law enforcement is chomping at the bit to use fMRIs as lie detectors, for example.  They have consistently ignored the scientific invalidity of polygraph examinations, of voice modulation tests, and I expect no better from them with regards to fMRI use.",1265646740

To take an example from another comment: a trip to Europe of equivalent cost has the same 'social signal' strength as do diamonds; but it also has tremendous utility for the woman (educational, memorable, enjoyable, etc.). Diamonds have no utility in jewelry form. So: signal+utility > signal.<p>The utility opportunity costs are staggering; >30 billion in the US alone.

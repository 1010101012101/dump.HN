We were allowed 10 minutes in, one person doing work, another observer, both required to have squirt water bottles and a two-way radio. We were instructed not to carry anything and to use a cart. We were told not to remove equipment that weighed more than a few pounds.<p>I pulled 10 drives so we could run them to another data center as a 'just in case'. The guy I was with passed out about 60' from the door. The air temp outside was ~72F and they had portable hurricane fans blowing air into the data center.<p>In that ten minutes, I drank 32 ounces of water. I remember that because I went to pick him up, kicked my water bottle by accident and it fell over because it was empty.<p>He spent 30 minutes in an ambulance, about three hours in a hospital from 10 minutes exposure.

This is the first small step across that threshold between ""comfortable for humans"" and ""comfortable for machines"" in data centers, and the first such step is usually the hardest one. If it's more efficient to run the servers in an even hotter environment, or in one that's less-habitable in some other way, you can probably expect it to happen, now that the baseline technology and ideas are here.<p>Not that I'm trying to seriously forecast anything, or have any special knowledge of data center design; this is just a pleasant exercise in near-future sci-fi.",1332560746

I'll ask one more question while I have your attention.<p>The first thing I searched for on that SEP page was ""Popper"", because my ""how do we know a car engine is not conscious"" stems from trying to apply falsifiability to my intuitive notions.

As an architect though I can't help putting in my 2 cents that cooling isn't simply a binary choice.<p>Firstly, the best thing to do environmentally would be to use the heat positively, connecting it into a centralised heat-distribution network for other users (for instance, other industries, public heated pools, or even residences).<p>Secondly, even without power, there is a lot you can do to maximise the heat-loss of a building: Eg. design to capture prevailing winds and utilise them to help heat escape, or internal arrangements to keep cooler 'microclimates' around areas used by maintenance staff and temperature-critical server elements. I am not sure what the design process of these buildings is, but I would bet that this sort of design doesn't get thought about.<p>Thirdly, you can also actively cool buildings without 'chillers' (refrigeration units), such as pumping earth-cooled water through the building (as 'chilled beams').

3748365,comment,3748324,3748324,2,0,kstenerud,,,"Short answer: Go to college.<p>Long answer:<p>College/university is for three things:<p>1. College is for gaining formal training in the profession you plan to enter. Foregoing that formal training leaves you without the foundations your profession is based upon, which means that you'll forever be solving problems in a sub-optimal way, leaving a trail of destruction in your wake. If you're looking for job security and high salary and good references, then you need something that elevates you above your peers. By not going to college, you lower yourself below your peers.<p>2. College is an opportunity to study other fields that you WILL be interacting with in the real world (such as business). That knowledge gives you a massive edge.<p>3. College is an opportunity to make contacts, which are invaluable as you progress in your career. In fact, I'd say that contacts are THE absolute biggest path to success. If you want to be successful, hang around successful people.",1332559037

3748356,comment,3747046,3747695,1,0,kls,,,"While basic is a good language to learn the (pardon the pun) basics of programming, it's not a great language to learn computer science if that is your goal. For that I think the best two languages you can learn are C and then Lisp. Neither are huge languages as far as number of jobs go but both are fundamental and foundational languages. Mastery of both will allow you to master any other language quickly. C will help you understand the hardware and Lisp will help you understand pure software CS theory that is why I recommend C first and then Lisp, you want to build a foundation, then layer on from that foundation and the best way is to work from the hardware up. Once you understand how the hardware is controlled by the software, it makes it very easy to see how to optimize code when you are dealing with what looks like pure software problems.<p>The Arduino board has a lot of support and following, so that is why I recommended it, and it supports other languages as well so as you grow and learn new languages you can use your knowledge of the board to learn new languages on. If you find a different board that you like though and it has a C compiler then it will suffice, but Arduino does have a huge community that tend to help each other out.",1332558796

It strikes me that intellectuals who have racked up the greatest kill-scores have done so because of their views in humanitarian fields (politics, philosophy, etc.) I am yet to see a genocide in the name of math or art.

Maybe that's true in some regimes, but there is still a bunch of performance-sensitive software written in C/C++ by developers who make good algorithm and data structure choices.<p>And so when these people get to looking at performance details, they're looking at constant factor improvements.  And as described in the article and elsewhere, the constant factors due to cache effects are often on the order of, say, 6 or 10.  The penalty to poor cache design can be huge, and it's important to know how they work to avoid that.",1265129841

He doesn't just make predictions like this, he actually bets on them.<p>For example, he bet that people would want to play a game with deep and intriguing gameplay regardless of the graphics. Then he bet that people would want to play it on a  handheld device (specifically, he targeted the Sharp Zaurus, but the game is compatible with some other palmtops of the same era). I think he's right on the first count, but too early on the second (targeting the iPhone, for instance, would probably have been more successful).<p>There are a number of other reasons the game didn't take off, but the point is that he's not an armchair pundit, shouting that we should all listen to him and take action based on his foresight.

1095294,comment,1094797,1095173,0,0,ajross,,,"That seems very unlikely.  Effects like the ones in the article (which is great, btw) can't be ""fixed"" simply by moving the data.  In the first example, there's simply no way for any runtime environment to ""know"" at creation time that you would be walking the array in 16 byte strides.  And if it tried to reorder the data dynamically, it would obviously have to <i>touch</i> all that memory, thus invalidating whatever caching could be done anyway.<p>Where JVMs beat naive C, it's almost always in the locking and synchronization code.  See the Sun paper on Biased Locking for an example of the kind of tricks you can do by (for example) ""guessing"" that newly locked objects are only ever going to be referenced by one thread.<p>But memory is memory.  The JVMs view of it lacks a raw pointer, but is otherwise pretty much the same as C's.",1265129044

From personal experience, it takes about a year to really learn how to work out of an office.<p>Multiply this by an entire office and they're in for a world of hurt.  To really successfully pull this off, they'd need a couple of fascists who already knew how to work remotely, people would need to defer to them, and they'd need a serious transition period to get used to all the tools they'll need (ie: work a day or two per week remotely).<p>The biggest problem they have, though, is one of measuring success.  They don't really say what a successful experiment's going to look like.  It's easy enough to measure writer output (quantity, not necessarily quantity), but most other facets of the business aren't quite as measurable.  Even the success of writers is ultimately determined by the number of eyeballs on their stories.  It's awfully hard to measure that stuff with any kind of reliability over the course of a month.<p>The best possible tool we've found for this is IRC.  I assume Campfire would work reasonably well, but it's awfully simple to find bots that speak IRC and do useful things.",1265126855

In some cases people are even willing to accept worse big O behavior because the ""worse"" algorithms use a lot of sequential access and parallelize easier than the sophisticated ones, more than making up the difference for the object counts that come up in practice.",1265126642

And I dunno but prices seem to be a little high.<p>Problem #2:...you need to convince people that your editors actually know what they are doing. You need to show that you have your editors take a certain test(ie proofread a 5 page essay to find all errors). That way people know the guy reading actually knows his stuff, and is not just a 12 year old kid who wants to make a few bucks.<p>Problem #3: Your editors need to be local. Native english speaker means different things in England, in United States and in India. You need to make sure the person proof reading the stuff is in the same country as the person paying the bill.<p>Problem #4: Domain sucks. Sure korect.me is quirky. But as you just saw I completely misspelled it on the first try. You need a domain that is misspell proof...or at least own the misspelled domains too.<p>Problem #5: Getting a .me domain is a great way to get penalized in search results. If you want even a tiny bit of people to find you via search engines, you need to change that to a .com<p>Problem #6: Your landing page sucks. You need to let a person know right away how much they'll be paying.<p>Problem #7: I want a discount should send a person to a new page, where you tell them about how they can get a discount. Right now you just send them to a blank page, with the discount code below the fold.<p>Problem #8: You need to add some guarantee...I dunno something like ""if we don't catch all errors, you get half off"". Make sure there is an incentive for proofreaders to get it right...and for the customer to trust you.<p>Problem #9: Your page is missing meta descriptions and meta keywords. Not only do those help with SEO but description is how your stuff appears in Google.<p>Problem #10: You need a word counter on the text box, and you should display a running total of how much the proofreading will cost the person.",1265126604

And I'm glad I gave it the time it requires to change workflows.<p>The most unexpected side-effect of using git is a newfound willingness to follow experimental ideas in my projects as fast as I can think/type.  I'll guess it comes from confidence in git's ability to safely partition branches in-situ; the relative speed and ease with which branches are created, merged and destroyed; and the existence of the index and stash.

The existence of a hate group is just a geographically local group of people who are racist AND like forming clubs.<p>A map of the per-capita hate crimes committed would be more educational, but again it would not be a measure of racism.  To have hate crimes you need 2 things, people who hate some group, and members of that group they can act against.  In the areas that were most heavily racist they chased out all hated minorities 50+ years ago.<p>The town I grew up in had 5000 residents and no black families (actually, some have moved there, but only when I was in about 3rd grade did that start).  I didn't see any racism at all in that town, but how could I?  Driving 30 minutes away to the nearest sizeable black population center and you see tons of it.  Look at the school zones and you see tons of it.  Hate crimes were non-existent however, just because you can't hit someone who isn't around.  Finally, if one did happen, how would it get reported?  In areas where hate crimes are super rare I would assume they would also be under reported since the justice system would be unfamiliar with recording and prosecuting them.<p>Finally, saying one area (red states) is 'more racist' than another is the exact same in-group out-group dynamic that feeds racism in the first place.  Due to the stuff I listed above, I would expect blue states to have far more racist acts, just because there are more cross-race interactions and boundaries (which are the only 'opportunity' people have to commit racist actions).  There is no discrimination against minorities for jobs if there are no minority applicants, and there is no discriminatory school zones or public service allocation if there are no minority communities in a city.  The unanswerable question is, ""Would there be if there were minorities there"", but that can't be captured in these sorts of statistics.",1265126474

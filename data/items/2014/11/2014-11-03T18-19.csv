The interesting question is what is the distribution of total wealth in the world, mapped onto the country.

It is, however, valid JavaScript. It uses open standards (ECMAScript, the various web APIs). It&#x27;s already supported by all browsers.<p>> It&#x27;s a non-W3C/TC39 approved set of compiler intrinsics/pragmas that switches on special behavior in one particular environment.<p>It&#x27;s not &quot;special behaviour&quot;. It&#x27;s a performance optimisation. It still behaves exactly like JavaScript.<p>> If asmjs takes off and everyone starts writing Web apps by transpiling C code, Mozilla will have forced a sea change in the Web, forcing all other vendors into ahead-of-time compilation to compete, and forcing JS VMs to optimize for this particular kind of code.<p>I don&#x27;t see why people would write Web apps by transpiling C code, the main advantage is for the existing codebases written in C. And other vendors don&#x27;t <i>necessarily</i> need to implement asm.js with AOT compilation. asm.js-conformant code works well very with JIT compilers.<p>> Now, maybe that&#x27;s not such a bad thing. I&#x27;m not arguing it isn&#x27;t, but I think arguing &quot;it&#x27;s just JS, the syntax is the same, therefore it&#x27;s open!&quot; is somewhat disingenuous. ASMJS, if super successful, would create an implicit implementation spec for everyone. It will have in essence, created a language with identical syntax to Javascript, but with completely different expected execution semantics.<p>No, it has identical execution semantics. It uses a static subset of JS, yes, but it&#x27;s still JavaScript. If I remove the <i>&quot;use asm&quot;</i> pragma, the code still does <i>exactly</i> the same thing.<p>> Why? Because developers would come to depend on ahead-of-time compilation, depend on apps that basically use emulated malloc&#x27;ed heaps, etc.<p>Is that bad? Bear in mind that, without asm.js existing, this was the case anyway. asm.js wasn&#x27;t created so that people could compile native code to run in the browser. It was created because people were already doing so, and by detecting the code patterns commonly used by compilers, they could make it run faster.<p>> Call this ASMJAVA. I now assert, this is &quot;Just java&quot;, hey, it runs in any JVM. Except, I&#x27;m shipping a new VM called &quot;SuperExpresso&quot; that does ahead-of-time compilation for my mobile platform based on this, and I&#x27;m telling people they don&#x27;t need to use native SDKs, they can just transpile C code to Java. Did I create a new standard? I think I just did.<p>Sure, you made a new standard. It&#x27;s a backwards-compatible one that doesn&#x27;t rupture the ecosystem, though.",1415040185

Haskell&#x27;s type system can in fact catch this error at compile time.<p>2.  Despite its celebrated type system, Haskell is not a sufficient base for building a well-typed program, but some other language would be.  (Coq?  Agda?  Some not-yet-existent language?)<p>3.

It&#x27;s a non-W3C/TC39 approved set of compiler intrinsics/pragmas that switches on special behavior in one particular environment.<p>When Dart was introduced years ago, Brendan Eich was all over HN complaining about how Dart2JS doesn&#x27;t solve the problem, because DartVM would be more performance, and introduce a tendency to optimize JS VMs towards those semantics.  Well, here we have a different problem. If asmjs takes off and everyone starts writing Web apps by transpiling C code, Mozilla will have forced a sea change in the Web, forcing all other vendors into ahead-of-time compilation to compete, and forcing JS VMs to optimize for this particular kind of code.<p>Now, maybe that&#x27;s not such a bad thing. I&#x27;m not arguing it isn&#x27;t, but I think arguing &quot;it&#x27;s just JS, the syntax is the same, therefore it&#x27;s open!&quot; is somewhat disingenuous. ASMJS, if super successful, would create an implicit implementation spec for everyone. It will have in essence, created a language with identical syntax to Javascript, but with completely different expected execution semantics.<p>Why? Because developers would come to <i>depend</i> on ahead-of-time compilation, depend on apps that basically use emulated malloc&#x27;ed heaps, etc.<p>Imagine I took the Java language, removed &quot;new&quot; and forced all code to allocate DirectBuffers, and then said, all classes must consist of static final methods (no polymorphism), and can&#x27;t have any fields or constructors.<p>Call this ASMJAVA. I now assert, this is &quot;Just java&quot;, hey, it runs in any JVM. Except, I&#x27;m shipping a new VM called &quot;SuperExpresso&quot; that does ahead-of-time compilation for my mobile platform based on this, and I&#x27;m telling people they don&#x27;t need to use native SDKs, they can just transpile C code to Java. Did I create a new standard? I think I just did.<p>Arguably, you can say the same thing about Android 4.4/5.0 &quot;ART&quot; runtime, or GWT which I work on. They use the Java &quot;language&quot;, but the runtime behavior is completely different, and at least for GWT, we make no bones about this.<p>So, this is not an attack on asmjs, but I do think there is a distinction between &quot;reusing the syntax&quot; of a language, and creating expectations of new semantics.

C, C++, Pascal, Swift, Go, D and the like. Not C# or Java.<p>> Isn&#x27;t it possible to compile parts of JavaScript to asm.js?<p>Yes... asm.js, which is a subset of JS, can be compiled to asm.js. You can compile any language to itself. There&#x27;s no real point in doing so, however.<p>More seriously, no, not really. JS is a dynamic language. It can&#x27;t be compiled ahead-of-time.<p>> For example the parts which deal with drawing - computing points of - complex things on a canvas?<p>No, you couldn&#x27;t compile that to native code. If you tried, I doubt it&#x27;d be faster than your browser&#x27;s existing JIT.<p>> That would be a good reason for JS devs to use asm.js - of course via a compiler, but if that&#x27;s not available, I can imagine some people doing this by hand. Remember that people used to code in real asm all the time a few centuries ago.<p>You <i>could</i> hand-write asm.js, but it&#x27;d be difficult. Manually manipulating the heap and stack isn&#x27;t fun. There&#x27;s no memory allocator included. It would make far more sense to just write in C, compile it, and write glue code, or just to write easily JIT-ed JS in the first place.",1415039023

The houses are usually on their books at the price the original owner paid for it, so selling it at the current market value causes them to take an accounting loss and makes the bank&#x27;s CEO look bad. Meanwhile the homes are still assets they can collateralize and trade as securities without actually allowing anyone to live in them, which is all the bank was ever interested in anyway, and not allowing anyone to live in it keeps overall housing prices higher, which is more important to mortgage banks than anyone else in the world. Meanwhile the value of the home isn&#x27;t actually going down, which is what would happen if they sold them at scale.",1415038924

Once the kernel finds a place to copy to, it can update the vm data structures (page tables or otherwise) to give the writer a private copy.<p>[1] Minor nitpick: for hugepages, there aren&#x27;t actually any PTEs involved, but that&#x27;s really just a terminology issue.

8552388,comment,8550915,8550915,0,0,astral303,,,"Angular 2.0 strikes me as a Maven 2.x moment. Maven 1.x was a brilliant idea that pragmatically addressed real, practical problems with building Java codebases. Some pragmatic decisions turned to be real ugly (Jelly), but you really could get a fair amount of stuff done and have a consistent build process. Then Maven 2.x came out and made everything way more complicated, way more rigid in a way that clashed with real development needs. Weird decisions in Maven 2/3, such as throwing away its dependency on Ant and rewriting all that functionality in a new library (years later, still missing features, e.g. ability to include/exclude files while creating certain types of archives). Such as nearly erasing the differential between internal and external projects, as a result taking away the ability to version all your internal artifacts with one variable. There was also heavy migration pain and overhead, as little of the previous custom code was compatible. And pretty much for all of Maven 2.x/3.x, having used Maven 1.x in serious anger, I was left wondering &quot;why oh why did you do this, and why did you change this?&quot; And many of the public motivations for changes were &quot;academically&quot; right, yet practically disastrous in large projects.<p>So, here we are, starting with Angular 1.x, which seemed to be fairly pragmatically designed to solve certain pains and has received (IMO well-deserved) uptake in the ecosystem. Now, we are looking at Angular 2.x, where many of the decisions seem &quot;academically&quot; right, yet feel to me (and many of us) as practically disastrous.<p>This article is essentially saying: &#x27;some kind of a migration path will definitely be worked on once we have a destination Angular 2.0, so stop freaking out.&#x27; Also this statement: &quot;. If you are working on Angular 1.x today and you like it, you should want 2.0 to exist and you should be an active participant in making it happen.&quot;<p>Listen, we&#x27;ve been around the block and we&#x27;ve seen projects go through changes like these. And we&#x27;ve seen enough projects fail after changes like these, and we&#x27;ve seen enough 1.x branches wither in abandonment. And we&#x27;ve spent years now advocating for more incremental development approaches that validate decisions little by little. And so when Angular, as a project, decides to make huge changes, Angular tech leadership should understand this modern climate, and should make sure that the messaging touches on migration right away.<p>Look, I&#x27;d love to be pleasantly surprised, but I sure am skeptical that this will be a successful transition. It just doesn&#x27;t sound like the Angular 2.0 project plans are grounded in reality of shipping production code and solving production problems. And I really think that&#x27;s the root cause red flag that has everyone up in arms.",1415038412

If you look at the news media, or the Hacker News front page for that matter, you stumble upon articles accusing China and Russia to hack into foreign governments regularly. Similarly, China and other asian countries are often accused of adding backdoors to their hardware (e.g., routers, switches, telco equipment). The only* backdoors ever found in hardware were found in hardware build by US-based companies.

It&#x27;s still insulting.)<p>The whole process is such a pain that people have written tools like ievms (<a href=""https://github.com/xdissent/ievms"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/xdissent/ievms</a>) just to automate the endless, tedious downloading-unpacking-installing-self-destructing-downloading-etc. cycle. And vendors like BrowserStack (<a href=""http://www.browserstack.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.browserstack.com/</a>) make good money charging people to do the same thing they could conceivably do with the VMs, just because using the VMs hurts so much people will happily pay to avoid it.<p>And the kicker: all of this nonsense, of course, is only necessary because you can&#x27;t install two versions of IE side-by-side. And the only reason you can&#x27;t install two versions of IE side-by-side is because Microsoft, back when it was Pure Evil, decided to <i>make it that way</i> to force people to upgrade Windows when they wanted to upgrade IE.<p>Microsoft management are considerably more enlightened these days than they were back then. But this huge, ugly, painful, <i>completely unnecessary</i> wart on the Windows development experience that they forced upon the world back then still persists, either because someone in Redmond thinks it&#x27;s a good idea, or just out of sheer laziness.",1415037958

Although, I wish you&#x27;d been a bit more polite didn&#x27;t assume bad faith with me in the process.<p>I&#x27;ve been in the process of providing a more &quot;human-readable&quot; (so to speak) breakdown of both the positives of his business practices, charity, etc. versus the negatives.  I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve ever researched something of this scale before or not, but it takes quite a bit of time to vet sources properly and break it all down into a fair manner with methodologies that others can easily understand, relate to and, indeed, find to be a fair comparison/assessment (overall).<p>Despite working on this with six other people (granted, all off-and-on in our spare time since, unlike Public Relations, we aren&#x27;t paid to do this), it&#x27;s taken well over a year so far.  Ughh..<p>In the meantime, I&#x27;ve provided sources of evidence to the public that should at the very least provoke more people to question the narrative that Gates is simply a net gain for society via his philanthropy and gains for society he created via his role at Microsoft, etc.  If Gates is a Robin Hood that stole from the rich to provide for the poor, I&#x27;ve yet to see much data that resembles that scenario.<p>So far, I have measured more counter-evidence that positively reflects Bill Gates&#x27; actions than the negative evidence I&#x27;ve gathered (for one, it&#x27;s very easy to find positives on Gates & MS).  Incredibly easy...  However, I&#x27;ve found it lacking once one considers all the costs that his monopolistic, anti-competitive behavior at this huge of a scale extolled upon society en masse along with Gates&#x27; personal hoarding of assets/money to climb towards his billionaire status to boot.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s also complicated by the fact that Gates&#x27; assets have provided both good and bad for society as well, so it&#x27;s quite complex.<p>But, again, if you&#x27;ve got some evidence that shows that Gates is an overall net gain for society after I&#x27;ve provided all this evidence to the contrary and I&#x27;m wrong on this, I&#x27;d like you to provide it.  I&#x27;d like to review it and add it to the pile if it&#x27;s not there already.  Who know, perhaps you have a much better perspective I or the six others haven&#x27;t yet considered.<p>For example, I&#x27;d like to see a better comparative analysis than what we have so far of all the jobs Microsoft destroyed versus ones they enabled internally and externally.  Love to compare methodologies on that as well with more people.<p>Anyway, otherwise, I suppose you can just assume bad faith on my part instead of forming an argument based upon your own sources of evidence, etc.<p>>That you are asking someone else to waste as much time as you<p>That&#x27;s hostile. How about you put some of that energy to good use and challenge my sources of evidence instead?<p>>sufficient proof that you are looking to silence, not evaluate.<p>I&#x27;m not looking to silence anyone at all.  I very much welcome more data whether it adds to the positive gain or negative drain.<p>But, anyway, if that&#x27;s all the &quot;proof&quot; you need to pre-judge my intentions, then I&#x27;m afraid we don&#x27;t require the same levels of evidence to support our own suppositions in the first place, perhaps.<p>tl;dr - I&#x27;m still working on this with others. I&#x27;d like to see a better comparative analysis than what we have so far, so if anyone can think of some data that seriously challenges the negatives, I&#x27;d enjoy gathering it.  I should also note I hope to have a final, comprehensive report completed, edited and ready for heavy rotation by Spring or earlier if we have the time and/or can get more people involved in the process.  But, so far, I haven&#x27;t seen anywhere near a net gain for society by Bill Gate&#x27;s actions and I hope in the end we can all learn that at the very least, there&#x27;s a better way to garner a successful business than hurting so many others in the process.",1415037836

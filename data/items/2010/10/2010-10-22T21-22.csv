People will gladly part of hundreds, maybe thousands of dollars a year if they like your service, but paying a thousand dollars to try a CMS out just doesn't make much sense.

Without compression, I see some voodoo hand-waving with logarithms and I don't even know what it means for an event to have X bits of entropy, or why I should care, or if I should believe the result. With compression, the entropy is suddenly a concrete measurable value with real-world import, and it's cool that you can prove hard lower bounds like that. So it may be deep, but at least to me it makes the whole thing make sense, rather than just adding complication.<p>You may be able to dodge the issue by not mentioning compression explicitly. It's nonsensical that a single die roll takes 2.58 bits, but it's perfectly believable that 100 die rolls could fit in 258 bits. Then with a little work, you can show that 258 is the smallest expected value of any encoding.

I don't think that's fair.  No one here is arguing for higher education for apathetic, disengaged students, or for low standards in higher education.<p>Also, this is twice that you've pulled out this 40k figure.  Is that from some other article?

Three points:
  (a) it's not always obvious whether a person's education is being put to productive use. Taking a job which directly requires that education is only one way a person might put their education to productive use.
  (b) among people who aren't putting their education to productive use, are these really all about choice? All of the friends I have that graduated in the past couple years who haven't ended up in jobs which specifically required their education haven't <i>chosen</i> to not make productive use of their education.  The job market for a lot of areas is tough right now, and a new graduate attempting to put his or her education to good use has to compete with more experienced applicants even for low level positions.   
  (c) even if they haven't found jobs where they can put their education to good use <i>yet</i>, doesn't mean they won't when the job market changes.

1821615,comment,1807247,1819977,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"I did start with the techniques, then checked if the languages supported them.  My ideas are a lot clearer than you seem to think.  Thanks to you and the others, I now have resolved my confusion: ""OO"" doesn't technically mean anything significant, but nevertheless carries a strong emotional load (positive or negative, depending on the reader).  That tends to end useful discussion and to encourage religious flame-wars. I now consider ""OO"" taboo, along with sentences like ""just a tool"".  I now believe that most programmers did fall in the trap I spoke of in my original post, but this trap appears to be less obvious than I thought.<p>Now about what implements what:<p>Coupling reduction is implemented by encapsulation.  There's no other way.  Any technique that reduces coupling is a form of encapsulation.  Any language that supports coupling reduction supports encapsulation.<p>Encapsulation is supported by 3 features: functions, modules, and classes.  Let's not talk about functions, whose presence don't differentiate.  So, to support encapsulation (and therefore coupling reduction), a language needs either modules or classes.<p>Code reuse is achieved with functions and abstraction as you defined it.  I don't know any other way, short of writing a DSL or using a whole program.  As before, let's not talk about functions themselves.  Therefore, any language that supports code reuse supports abstraction.<p>Abstraction means I can interact the same way with two ""things"" if they are of the same type.  Well, I think that by ""guy"", you meant ""something with embedded behaviour"", and not just dead data, like integers or arrays.  Such a thing is necessarily a closure.  Closures can be achieved by 3 mechanisms: subtype polymorphism (interfaces, mixins…), duck typing, and first class functions (which are isomorphic to duck typed mono-method objects). I said ""parametric polymorphism"" earlier, but it isn't actually needed.  So, to supports abstraction (and therefore code reuse), a language must have either subtype polymorphism or first class functions.<p>Now Back to OO.<p>To support OO, a language must support encapsulation and abstraction.  I've established that it's the same as saying that it must support coupling reduction and code reuse.  And intuitively, a language that doesn't support either of them isn't worth using.  Therefore any modern language should support OO.<p>Now, supporting OO is not the same as <i>being</i> OO.  To be OO in my book, a language must actually strongly encourage the frequent use of encapsulation and abstraction.  As it happens, most modern languages do.<p>Almost all have either modules or classes.  And when they do, they strongly encourage you to use them systematically, if they do not flatly mandate it like Java.<p>Likewise, almost all have either subtype polymorphism, duck typing, or first class functions.  And when they do, they strongly encourage their frequent use.<p>Which means that almost every modern language strongly encourages the frequent use of all the necessary OO features.  In other words, almost every modern language is OO.  C++ and Java are OO because of their classes and subtype polymorphism.  Ocaml and Haskell are OO because of their module system and their first class functions.  You probably didn't intend to qualify those last two as OO (I don't, and they don't claim to be), but they fit your definition nevertheless.",1287783291

A more intuitive explanation is that with an ideal encoding scheme, 100 non-vowel die rolls would take, on average, 258 bits to encode. This is still somewhat probabilistic, but it makes a bit more sense, because it's no longer necessary to have a direct relationship between die rolls and bits.

The build files are very difficult to read, so it's like a black box.  They are also cruel enough to name the root file ""build.xml"" so it interferes with you trying to make a convenient IDE agnostic build script.  It depends on netbeans specific libraries for copying files (WHY?!).  It's very difficult to get it to build from the command line.  If you check out the hudson tutorial on how to get a netbeans project building in their CI server, you have to run a headless version of netbeans on the box to do it.<p>Not only that, the build scripts do some really crazy black magic.  You can edit parts of them and your changes get ignored.  It's like netbeans generates them every time you try to run.  This allows you to do things like put echo statements in the build scripts that don't get printed out even though the target runs.  It's really confusing.<p>It is not very organized.  If you go into the ""Options"", it has 5 big buttons at the top.  Most things are in the ""Miscellaneous"" section.<p>The debugger and profiler are really slow.  When I remote debug, I have to click ""step over"" two times for one line of code.  Expanding objects in the variables tab takes an annoying amount of time.  My app is apparently too big to even start with the profiler.  I've waited over 25 minutes before giving up.  In intellij, the jprofiler plugin lets me start the same project without any noticeable slowdown.<p>Many many UI problems.  You can't work with multiple ""run"" configurations like you can in the other IDEs.  EG: If you want to run a certain unit test, you have to find it, go into it, and then run it.  In the other IDEs, you could save that unit test as something to run and run it while you're looking at another file.<p>Speaking of unit tests, there's no way to run an individual unit test.  The finest granularity is the entire file.<p>It crashes all the time.  You're going to have to accept my anecdotal evidence here, but everyone else in the office complains about this, too.<p>The list goes on and on.  I'm extremely skeptical of anyone that claims netbeans is good.  I suspect you're using it as a glorified text editor instead of an IDE.<p>It's not 100% terrible though.  One thing that netbeans is good at is generating code.  I haven't tried in Eclipse, but netbeans' webservice generation support is better than intellij's.  It also has a good Swing WYSIWYG.",1287781525

1190490,comment,1190389,1190389,0,0,stuntgoat,,,"org-mode for emacs is great.<p>Prioritize your list of things to do. That way you only have 1 thing to do next. It may seem daunting to have a pile, but if you line everything up in a neat row, you can only see 1 thing to do until it is finished.<p>A good way to eliminate things from your immediate workload is to only do things that will make your life more efficient. Some projects are fun but will not make it easier to get more things done later.<p>If you have a unifying reason for completing a series of projects, that can help inspire you- especially, if it is a great reason. I think I read somewhere that Stravinsky said you have to force yourself to be inspired. . .",1268557124

Maybe you need a better reason to do the important things. Maybe the 'important things' really aren't, in which case you need to come up with a list of genuinely important things to do.<p>Maybe you should see a therapist.

1190459,comment,1190313,1190313,0,0,csytan,,,"Although this talk is mostly slanted towards language APIs, I thought I'd share some tips for writing Web APIs:<p><pre><code>  - Don't roll your own auth.  
    Use HTTPS and include username/password in POST parameters.
  - Avoid Sessions.
  - Strict REST is overrated:
    Browser support is universal for GET and POST, and patchy for everything else.
  - Make URLs easy to construct
  - Use GET requests to read data from your server.
    Use POST requests when changing data on your server.
  - Requests: URLencoded parameters
  - Response: URLencoded parameters, CSV, or JSON. Avoid XML.
  - Asynchronous responses:
    Let the user set a POST url to their web service in the request.
  - JSONP for browser based APIs</code></pre>",1268554060

Often when faced with a few large tasks, I will create a new Google Tasks list and then successively ""yak shave"" them down to a few dozen smaller/quicker tasks.

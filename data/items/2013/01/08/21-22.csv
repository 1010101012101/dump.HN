We had over 900 students attend this fair last year, making it a very successful recruiting and networking event for both companies and attendees.<p>A full table at the Career Fair entitles you to one six-foot table with a maximum of four representatives (a half table is maximum two reps). Both options include parking, free shuttle service from the venue to the parking and back, break-time snacks and refreshments, and access to post jobs on our entrepreneurship email newsletter, the BASES Digest, reaching over 5,000 people. You will also be given a complimentary copy of the Resume Booklet, which consists of an orderly collection of resumes of all Stanford students seeking jobs and internships.<p>When purchasing a table at the BASES Startup Career Fair you also have the option to register for the Startup 101 Career Fair simultaneously for a $50 discount on both fairs combined. The Startup 101 Career Fair is hosted with five other student groups and held in Tresidder Memorial Union on February 27th from 10am-4pm. If you would like to register separately for this fair and not the BASES Startup Career Fair please contact us at bases-external-relations-12-13@lists.stanford.edu for more information.<p>Shortly after registration you will receive a link to a survey to fill out with more information about your company and the types of students you are looking for, and closer to the date of the career fair you will receive an email with more information about the logistics of the day of the fair. We look forward to your participation in our upcoming career fair!",1357682320

When I started working at my current school, we had an ""inquiry team"", whose job it was to download spreadsheets from the myriad of different services and databases used by the Department of Education (as well as those adopted by my school in addition). The team would then go through the downloaded spreadsheets and try to make sense of the data by copying and pasting columns from one sheet to the other. The team consisted of about 5 teachers who spent hours of their own time doing this.<p>I wrote some database software that took a lot of the hurt out of the process. Pop in the data in CSV format and it crunches all of the numbers and connects all the dots. That said, the whole workflow is still a bit of a pain. Most of the data is locked up in silos lacking any sort of API, but sporting a user interface that compels a little piece of my soul to shrivel up every time I have to log in and download the CSVs. Additionally, I have to bother the school support staff because I don't even have access to some of the data. Each different data source requires me to write a different parser. In the mean time, I still have to plan lessons and teach kids.<p>I've kicked the tires on the Clever API and it's fantastic for my purposes. They've done some incredibly cool stuff to make it easy to access data I've previously struggled to get my hands on. I'm really excited about the work they're doing and super-excited for more partners to come on board and use their API. It's going to change the way we deal with student data and ultimately get quicker information out to our teachers so that they can make better instructional decisions for our students.",1357681569

But they grow slowly, so you need to run them for zero to no money initially. That pretty much rules out even AWS as a hosting option. You can host probably 10 of these sites on a cable modem like setup, or in someone's garage in a KS Google Fiberhood. But you when it grows you will need to scale it quickly to avoid a burnout effect.<p>So operationally you start with a plan to make something you can just push out static pages on a regular basis to a simple web server. Bring up thttpd on a Raspberry Pi and drop it with a baby UPS into a dirt cheap co-location facility. Your uptime won't be great but you will be able to pay all the hosting costs for a year with the sale of one advertising deal. Ultra-lean. When it grows you point your CMS at a bigger instance, push it, pop the DNS records and blam, you're at the next level. Rinse and repeat.<p>Now on sales. If you're going to monetize a 'city info' type thing to businesses the <i>only</i> thing that matters to small business is if they spend money and it is 'worth it' to them. The only way to prove that is to create a way for visitors to your web site to self identify at the small business. Ask for them to provide a way, such as a coupon deal that is only available through you, and give them the advertising for free until they get their first, second, or maybe third customer who walks in the door with your coupon. The more robust you can make it, the more they will understand what you bring them. Then come to an agreed upon rate. Price your service to be better than the local newspaper or the Yellow pages. But as high as you can go until you lose sales over it. You won't get a lot of deals early on so you need to leave very little money on the table.<p>Don't get caught up in the GroupOn/LivingSocial crap, just drive feet into their doors with solid discovery tools. Seek out the people who you can serve who have more specialized needs, like companies that want to recruit quality talent, like realtors who want to get first shot at the person relocating to the city, or even local governments trying to educate the community about their activities.<p>I would expect it to take 3 - 5 years.

5028618,comment,5027560,5027808,13,0,Sandman,,,"I had the same experience. When I first heard about Clojure, one of the first things I learned was that it was a Lisp. But having read in numerous comments, blog posts etc. that ""only the top percentile of programmers use Lisp"", and since I don't consider myself to be anywhere near the top percentile, I felt that my programming chops might not be adequate enough to learn it.<p>So I put off learning Clojure for about a year or so. However, I grew more and more weary of Java's obvious shortcomings, the inherent bureaucratic nature of the language and lack of modern programming features (such was the situation at the time at least, things are starting to look better for Java nowadays) and started to look to other languages. I tried Scala. It didn't work out. I still wanted to leverage my existing knowledge of JVM and the whole Java ecosystem, so I turned to Clojure again. Also, having spent perhaps too much time on HN, I really wanted to see what that fuss about Lisp was all about.<p>Anyway, what I found out was that you do not, in fact, need to be a genius developer to learn Clojure. Actually, Clojure was everything I hoped for. It's dead simple. The syntax is minimal compared to some other languages. You may have heard other people say that learning Lisp can be an enlightening experience. Yes, there definitely are some enlightening  moments, but not in the sense that you need to spend years meditating on something to be able to understand it. Read a good book, there are plenty of those around now, watch some of Hickey's talks, and you'll get it.<p>To summarize, here's my message to anybody who is thinking of learning Clojure - don't get discouraged and give up on Clojure before even trying to learn it just because it's a Lisp. It may seem strange and perhaps a little frightening at first, but once you spend some time with it, you'll get amazed at how wonderfully simple it really is, and how powerful it is precisely because of this simplicity.",1357680356

They immediately want to jump to solutions or to fixing the problem without even being able to elaborate the precise problem beyond ""he sucks"" or ""he can't do x"" etc. The problem with stopping there and not critically thinking further is that you risk not trying hard enough and smart enough to make conflicts between founders work out. For every tragic founder story, there are plenty of successful stories where if you dig deeper, you will find the successful founders who at one point were at significant disagreement but instead of moving on, they took the time to deliberately make things work out. This may require Founder A to coach Founder B in a specific area or for Founder B to rapidly change certain behavior etc.<p>From the outset, be willing to invest time and brain to making things work out before deciding to split.

Michael Church is commenting on a HN thread about Google so he can talk about how his ideas about Google+ Games were unjustly ignored!<p>I, like some other Googlers I know, regularly resist replying to his posts here. But he <i>still</i> hasn't let it go, so I'm going to give it a shot. Feedback from other HNers welcome.<p>THESE ARE MY OWN WORDS AND PERSONAL OPINIONS AND DO NOT REPRESENT ANYONE ELSE'S.<p>I'm a random Google engineer and a fan of Euro board games. When michaelochurch wrote his Real Games manifesto here, I thought he made some good points. He's obviously a smart guy, and his writing is long-winded but articulate. Then I watched in horror and fascination as he wrote one jaw-dropping mass email after another. I used to think he was a troll, but I now believe he's completely earnest, which ironically makes him the perfect troll. Since his short time at Google, he has continued to write screeds against Google's internal processes on one Hacker News story after another, where his passion and self-assurance makes him appear credible, when he appears to be suffering from the Dunning-Kruger Effect.<p>I have hesitated to get involved in these threads, figuring that it's not worth the effort, and knowing that it is asymmetrical, in three respects:<p>1. It's very difficult to effectively rebut Michael Church's extensive allegations with vague aspersions, but I can't cite specifics from internal discussion lists because they are confidential.<p>2. Michael Church is indefatigable. We saw what happened when Googler after Googler tried to engage in dialog with him, to reach out to him, to help him. I'm exhausted at the mere thought of trying to describe all the flame wars and all the dirt, much less voluntarily engaging with him now.<p>3. Personal attacks are distasteful, they're not ""Googley,"" and even if true, they can end up reflecting badly on the attacker.<p>As the saying goes, ""Never mudwrestle with a pig -- you both get dirty, but the pig likes it.""<p>The last time I almost replied to michaelochurch and resisted, it was this post -- <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4715734"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4715734</a> -- where he wrote:<p>> The lesson I learned from that ordeal is not to try to ""save"" a company from itself because you can't. You'll be seen as right, and possibly even lionized, long after you leave.<p>This is a quintessential example of his delusion. I say this, not for spite, but for truth: the notion that Michael Church is now ""seen as right"" inside Google, much less ""lionized,"" is laughable. It literally provoked laughter.<p>Today, here, michaelochurch wrote:<p>> I do know a strategy that would have made it succeed because, when I was at Google, I proposed it.<p>Another quintessential example of his infinite confidence in his own ideas. Simply stunning. Imagine if someone said something like, ""I do know a strategy that would have made the Ford Focus succeed because, not long after I was hired at Ford, I proposed it."" You would rightly be skeptical, no matter how many thousands of passionate words he wrote on the subject over the following months and years.<p>I could give some more examples of things written on the web under the name Michael O. Church, but that risks entering the realm of ""personal attacks"" that I balk at for the reasons described above.<p>Instead, I'm gonna get back to work now. Thanks for reading. Like many before me, I wish Michael Church the best of luck, I harbor no ill will, and I hope he finds whatever makes him happy.",1357679364

Second, if people are that bad at assessing risk, that's all the more reason to err on the side of safety. But most importantly, choices have consequences, including the choice to have sex with someone who isn't worth that kind of trust; you can say it's not practical to avoid that (I don't agree, but that's another argument), but saying that doesn't change the consequences of the choice.

And it would be easier if people were taught that trust is something important that should not be given lightly.

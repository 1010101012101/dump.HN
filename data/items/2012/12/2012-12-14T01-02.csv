4919203,comment,4918913,4919052,2,0,daeken,,,"> I'm still often shocked that Youtube can afford all the bandwidth required for streaming video; he barely remembers the world where unlimited streaming video wasn't the norm.<p>You know, looking back it's silly, but when Youtube came out and started getting attention (I was still in school, so this must've been 2004 or so), I remember thinking to myself ""so what?"" -- the idea that it was novel just never occurred to me.<p>Back in 2002-2003, I ran a little startup (at 14-15) that did online music streaming.  Built around a little PHP (later C++) daemon, you could set up playlists on the site and then connect to an icecast stream to play that playlist from any device you wanted.  The music was ripped from CDs that my friends and I had, and we even added advertisements every X songs or N minutes.  It eventually failed due to not being able to raise money to get licensing rights (my dad was running the business side and simply had no clue, but neither did I at the time), but it was just... no big deal to me.  I had no idea that it was supposed to be a hard thing to do until a few years later, when I ended up working for MP3tunes trying to build the first online music locker.<p>I always just assumed that the trend towards storage and bandwidth being ""free"" was going to move fast enough that anything I could come up with would Just Work (TM).",1355450391

4919181,comment,4918669,4919117,8,0,rdl,,,"Lower personal income tax, all other things equal, is better.  I wasn't trying to directly compare sales tax vs. personal income tax vs. payroll tax vs. corp income tax vs. capital gains vs. property tax.  Just that B&O/gross receipts is worse than corp income tax.<p>I'm personally pro something like a broad VAT with a $20k credit or $50k exemption, including property.  In general, consumption taxes seem preferable to income or investment taxes, in that they deter consumption vs. deterring investment.  Consumption has fewer inherent positive externalities than investment or income.  And then add additional taxes for the purpose of capturing and offsetting externalities like pollution, traffic, etc., rather than strictly as revenue.<p>And I'd really like to see experiments on taxing status goods.  Create or find things like they have in game economies, which are not really necessary or important, and which are purely purchased for signaling value, and tax those.  Raising the taxes on those things, thus raising cost, is beneficial to the buyers and to society.  (I think Scott Adams from Dilbert has proposed this.)",1355450007

4919177,comment,4919022,4919127,5,0,MaxGabriel,,,"Yeah we're much stronger on Android. This is before my time at Heyzap, but my understanding is that Heyzap on Android was initially more popular and more profitable to sell Cost-Per-Install ads for. Thus, there was a major focus on improving the Android app and the sales team was focused on selling CPI (and SDK integrations) for Android. Since we get alot of users from people who integrate our SDKs, that further boosted the Android app.<p>So basically, this created a feedback loop where Android had many more users than the iPhone app. Indeed, the iPhone app didn't get alot of attention until recently, but in the last couple of months it (and the iOS SDKs) reached feature/design parity with the Android app. We also recently added a sales team member whose focus is on iOS developers, so if things go well we'll add many more users to iOS.",1355449894

I agree most pivots do have some tangential relationship from the previous goal thats because you learn where the market is from what you've done. Thats not to say its the only way to find a new market opportunity. I'm not sure why you define Twitter as a pivot and not Fab. Twitter was Odeo which was a podcasting company which was sinking. Evan Williams had blogging experience but Jack Dorsey (as I understand it) was the original idea guy behind Twitter.<p>A lot of pivots aren't related to the original idea that founded the company.

4919157,comment,4918913,4919078,2,0,scrumper,,,"> Basically, I want to consult with my teenage self and use that advice to invest time/money!<p>You and me both. As the eldest child, it was my job to walk the dog three times a day during school holidays. Most of the time I'd go alone. During those endless walks along riverbanks, through fields and down twisty country lanes I'd think and invent and create in my head. It was wonderful.<p>I remember dreaming up a multi-player game set in space, where every character would be played by another real person. You'd join a ship's crew and go exploring a gigantic galaxy. I was inspired, of course, by Elite on the school BBC and Star Trek; by the 9600 baud modem my Dad 'borrowed' from work and the bulletin boards it gave me access to; and by a dreamy child's desire for complete and total escape. A good fifteen years later Eve Online came out and I got my wish, just as I was settling into a busy career and saving for my first house. I've never even downloaded it.<p>Then there's the sketches I made in the mid '80s for a handheld computer with a touch-screen interface that would communicate, via radio, with transceivers in public buildings to give people directions and information. There was even messaging, with a kind of dead-letter-drop store-and-forward system that carried data between the transceivers on devices themselves, like a weird cross between bittorrent and the Royal Mail. I don't think I'd even heard of email at that point.<p>I came up with so much on those long walks. Nearly all of it has been developed in some form or other, never exactly as I imagined but always better in some ways and worse in others.<p>For me it's one of the most heartbreaking things about growing up: there's no time to indulge in exploration for its own sake. I can't focus my entire brain on a single thing for any length of time at all. If I could, if only I could.",1355449557

I know a lot of people talk about how Clojure is a language of libraries and micro-libraries, and not a language of frameworks, but I think frameworks would go a long way towards speeding up (and making more pleasant) repetitive projects like web design.  Re-gluing libraries together for every project gets tiring, and I think frameworks would help with this.<p>There was a talk I watched a while back about selling Clojure to enterprise (Neal Ford, maybe?) and one of the points was that appealing to the people who are consumed with getting stuff done (ie Delphi and Rails types) is a good way to spread a language because those people tend to leave a trail of projects behind them.<p>I don't think that Clojure has any frameworks that would appeal to these types of people (others might disagree).  I'm not saying that Clojure's libraries are bad (many are quite good), just that they're not designed to get a project up and running as soon as possible.  ""Up and running fast"" is a good option to have.",1355447615

Let's take the web we've got today, and let's consciously retrofit it with the plumbing we had back then. Let's take the services we all work on and stick in those APIs. Let's make it all work better together, so that the sum of all the web applications is far more than all the web applications separately.<p>Think about the back-end services we all value: Stripe. Twilio. AWS. What unites all of them is that they're incredibly simple to develop with, and to connect into other applications. That's why Twitter succeeded in the beginning, too: because its API was simple enough that people could build apps for the nascent mobile app ecosystem. <i>This is good for all of our products</i>, as well as for the web's health as a platform.<p>It's not hard.

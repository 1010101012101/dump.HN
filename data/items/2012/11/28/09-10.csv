4841766,comment,4840807,4841590,19,0,laumars,,,"I disagree with that. Apache's defaults on most distros isn't secure. Even 'enterprise' level distributions often fall into the following traps when packaging Apache:<p>1-> auto indexing enabled  (should be disabled)<p>2-> user directories enabled (should be disabled)<p>3-> server signatures 'on' (should be 'off')<p>4-> server tokens set to 'full' (should be 'prod')<p>5-> hidden (dot prefixed) files not always blacklisted as unauthorised files in Apache config<p>6-> same as above for editor specific back up files (eg file~). But this is only an issue for people who bulk upload or edit files on the live server (very naughty).<p>7-> having less optimal SSL configurations (Apache's default SSL set up isn't PCI compliant).<p>(IIRC there's a couple of other Apache tweaks, but that's just off the top of my head)<p>Then you have issues with PHP (eg logging to STDOUT so web users can view PHP errors).<p>And that's just covering the webserver configuration. There's still holes that need plugging if you actually want to run a <i>secure</i> web server; one of my favourite tools for that is using <i>fail2ban</i> which will auto-blacklist IPs in iptables (Linux firewall) based on if certain attacks are detected. For example it can prevent brute force attacks on SSH brute force attacks (which negates the need to run <i>denyhosts</i> as recommended in the article), HTTP auth, FTP, mail servers, etc.<p>And touching on SSH, many data centres will enable root log ins on their OS pre-installs by default. Your first job on any such box will be creating a user account and then disabling root log ins (<i>PermitRootLogin no</i> -> /etc/ssh/sshd_config).<p>Then there's a whole stack of optimisations you can run on <i>iptables</i> to adaptively prevent port scanning, forged TCP/IP packets and such like.<p>Also many distributions ship FTP, which is insecure by default. Anyone sys admin requiring FTP hosting would be better off using a chrooted SFTP environment (so the security benefits of SSH plus the sandboxed (chroot) environment that FTP often benefits).<p>Let's also not forget the plethora of internal services (databases, MTAs (mail servers), etc). If you're reading this article then you're probably not a trained systems administrator or not working for a large enough company where each server is running in it's own environment. Thus your MySQL / Postgre / whatever databases are running on your webservers. So you need to ensure that your database is only listening on localhost (127.0.0.1). Same applied for your MTA, unless you are intentionally providing a mail services (it is advisable to have an MTA installed even if you're not providing mail services because you can then set up daemons like <i>fail2ban</i> to automatically e-mail you when attempted break ins happen; which will in turn allow you to spot any determined hackers and permanently ban their IP from your box).<p>And lastly, if you're really paranoid, run your webserver inside a Linux/UNIX container (FreeBSD Jail, Solaris Zone, Linux OpenVZ) instead of inside a virtual machine as there have been hacks where attackers can break out of the VM and gain access to the host system (as of yet, I've not heard such attacks from containers, but if anyone has any evidence of that then I'd love to know). Running inside a container will give your webserver the sandboxed environment to work with plus an easy route for backups / snapshotting meaning minimal downtime and data loss should the worst happen and your server does become compromised.<p>(source: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCPFlwSCmvU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCPFlwSCmvU</a> - it's a plugged vulnerability, but it will give you an idea about the kind of issues VMs face when compared to containers)<p>In short; distribution's don't ship secure defaults. They ship a happy medium between usability and security. However if you have an internet facing box (particularly one not hidden behind a hardware firewall, as many budget set ups are not), then the happy medium isn't secure enough.",1354096627

Reimaging a physical box is a pain.<p>Obviously, if you are into HPC and very low-latency, you need physical hardware. You probably need some specialty networking hardware too and maybe less OS than most of us would like to have. But then we are no longer in the general purpose amd64 box world anymore.<p>I remember one instance where we were having some trouble with one batch-processing workload. The amd64 box we had for that was not enough, despite having much more memory and processing cores than its peers. I suggested we moved the workload to an almost abandoned Itanium box we had played with for some time. The HP machine crunched the workload more than 3 times as quickly. I noticed the working datasets could fit completely inside its (then) huge L3 cache (16MB, IIRC) but not in the 4MB of the amd64 machine, more or less eliminating the external memory bus penalties.",1354096161

I know it runs a stable and updated OS and it just runs and runs and runs. You need a newer software version? You can selectively take some from testing or even unstable if you have to. You still get timely updates and live in an eco-system that is largely seen as proven, stable, excellent. Ubuntu (afaik) only get's Debian testing packages anyway, but still needs to patch them or tweak them. Or you get non-upstream packages. Also my experience is that Debians configuration is quite secure by default. Whereas Ubuntu tries to make it easy for you but also more open to security flaws.<p>- for an enterprise i can totally see why many choose RHEL (because of support, fast security updates and great in-house know-how. Do you know how many kernel developers are  employed by Ubuntu? You don't want to know.. I give a lot of Kudos to RedHat for being such an open and contributing company.)<p>- for a start-up i can totally see how FreeBSD might fit as an internet-facing frontend.

I <i>really</i> got into web development around ten years ago, and have been a Firefox since back when Firefox was simply called Mozilla.

3578612,comment,3566623,3566623,1,0,devs1010,,,"Actually I started to build something that is a job search ""augmentation"" tool, it uses the Indeed.com API and uses a roll-out sidebar to list job openings and then you can go through them and then mark them blocked, applied to, saved, etc to filter through them so you never have to look at the full list again, I built the original solution using the Java stack and used it a bit for my own purposes, now that I'm getting more into Ruby I think I might rebuild it using Rails and see if I can make it into a more fully featured application, I think there is potential to add in more features similar to what you have mentioned (like being able to associate contact names with a job ad, etc).<p>On a side note, something I have realized is how fundamentally broken and annoying a lot of companies' job application process is. The sites that make you create an account on some barely working site that looks like it was built in 1995, then force you to basically manually fill out pieces of your resume into various input fields, are rather appalling. It is a good way to filter out the companies that probably wold suck to work for though as you can tell right away how much they care about interfacing with their employees.",1328936254

But then I realized that those algorithms are just basic concepts behind fancy names.<p>I was recently reading an article from that C++ guy at Facebook, where he talked about the programming challenges they do during interviews. He mentioned that every candidate should at least be able to write a simple version of the 'strstr()' function.<p>I did some research. I learnt about Boyer-Moore, and I realized that it was actually pretty straightforward and simple. Then I thought about how it might be optimized for tiny alphabets, such as DNA sequences. I came up with some ideas while travelling, and when I got home, I found a research paper that used exactly the same approach.<p>So that's when I realized that the world of algorithms wasn't as daunting as I thought it was. 
Optimization can sometimes make them a little hard to read, but even the most complex ones can be broken down into understandable pieces.",1328934932

I don't really follow SF politics that much, but I think the payroll tax fixes and creating more commercial real estate are both supported by the vast majority of SF startups; the most debatable thing is probably sit-lie, but personally having lived around 6th/Market in the past, I strongly support a solution to aggressive panhandling, homelessness, etc. (mainly, better mental health and addiction programs)<p>His other personal charity/political interests seem to be totally benign -- UCSF Medical, various children's charities, etc., so I'm more likely to think his involvement in SF politics is for his portfolio (and the wider startup and business community), vs. much personal interest in politics.<p>Although Ron Conway for Mayor or CA Governor would be awesome.",1328934599

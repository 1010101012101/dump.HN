1880939,comment,1880812,1880883,0,0,derefr,,,"More general advice: if you have some special talent—anything at all—then you can be someone's Joanna. Basically, you just have to ""overachieve for marketing purposes."" Don't give crap away for free, while only your paying customers get the 'real thing'; instead, make sure even the least of what you do—replying to comments on a forum, for example—is extremely polished. By-and-large, people's first impression of you will be through something you did for free, so make those first impressions great, and you'll make them want to see what <i>paying</i> you gets them.<p>This advice also applies to companies. If you're an engineering-focused software company—i.e., a company that has building, not selling, in its genes—and you have a $1MM budget for advertising, don't spend it on a spread in the New York Times; instead, invest that money in building a product—like any other your company would build, for a client, for money—but then <i>give that product away</i>. If you built something that's really useful, it'll do a much better job of organically spreading your brand than any ad campaign ever could.",1289177970

    and is constantly scheming startups.
</code></pre>
What Hardware Am I Using?<p><pre><code>    27"" iMac i7 w/ 16GB ram
        - Best Mac I've ever owned, hands down.

    2.66GHz Quad-core Mac Pro w/ 8GB ram w/ 20"" Cinema Display
        - Surprisingly don't use this much
          ever since I got my iMac. Mostly for testing third party hardware
          like videos cards, etc with what I'm working on.
     
    Dell Precision T3500 Xeon 2.4 GHz w/ 4GB ram
        - My guinea pig machine for random shit
        - Various Linux distros (FreeBSD, Ubuntu, and testing of new 
          builds of various)

    Asus Rampage Gene III 3.06GHz i7 w/ 6GB ram & AMD Radeon HD5830
        - Prototype hardware for a project I'm working on, picked for it's
          north/south bridges and socket.
</code></pre>
And what software?<p><pre><code>    Tons...On Mac-native I use a ton of terminal/vi, Smultron, Xcode suite, 
    CS5 suite, and various others. VMWare and Parallels both...Some projects
    only work in either/or, plus I just genuinely can't make up my mind.
    Cyberduck for ftp. I use MAMP Pro to control a self-updated version of
    my web services (apache, php, etc)

    Don't know if you care, but of course I use all the normal command line
    programs any nerd does...and for repos I prefer SVN only cause I used
    CVS (don't hate on me yo) but I use git, hg, etc daily and love them
    as well. Ultimately I'd be happy if everyone would just pick ONE.
    I wouldn't care which cause they all have their strengths..
    
    Browser I use Safari for casual, Firefox for primary development
    (Firebug > Webkit Inspector) and I've got a verion of Chromium that
    a buddy of mine and I made some cool changes to, but I haven't used it
    recently cause it was forked from such an old trunk.

    Web apps I use gmail (for all my mail), google docs, and mobileme.
    Probably some various others from time to time.
</code></pre>
What Is My Dream Setup?<p><pre><code>    I used to have a Macbook Pro that got ruined in an apartment flood
    6 months ago, so I've been thinking about replacing it with one of
    those new 11"" Macbook Airs. So sexy.

    I'm actually working on my true dream setup as a startup.  We've
    only recently begun so it's a little self-absorbed to report much
    more then that: http://mythologylabs.com

1880913,comment,1879739,1879739,0,0,fhe,,,"I am a Chinese who went to college (a small liberal arts college) in the States. This was 10 years ago, so I am not part of the current wave. I returned to China after graduation, and have recently begun interviewing applicants for my alma mater (because there are now so many applicants from China). I have been meeting currently enrolled students and applicants. Here are a few observations.<p>- there are indeed a lot more of them than before. at the time I was attending, each year we had maybe one student from China. Now they enroll 5-6 every year.<p>- more rich kids. when i was attending, the chinese students were all attending on a full scholarship from the school (private US education cost being what it was, and Chinese per capita GDP being what it was, few Chinese families could afford it without the scholarship) - these probably explains why they admitted only one student from China per year. but these days, the families don't seem to bat an eye paying the full $40K+/year.<p>- students are getting more mainstream. in the 90s, applying to colleges from China was like a hack. nobody knew much about anything. to even dream of such things was to be a little quirky. but these days there are all these SAT prep courses and consultants (two of my friends were in this business), and high schools have dedicated advisors on applying to US colleges. and this shows in the students admitted. I remember back then the Chinese students were more creative and original and adventurous (for coming to the US is a risky/adventurous thing to do. selection bias here, not unlike the adventurous 1st generation immigrants coming to the States); these days we get far more over-achieving resume-builders who were president of student clubs, and I think will go on to be investment bankers and have successful careers and I hope will donate back to the school generously one day. Instead of the odd kid who couldn't fit in, and said ""f&!k it, I am getting the hell out of here"" -- I was such a kid. (I realize this is probably an unfair judgment because I did not have as much interaction with the current students/applicants as I had with people whom I attended school with.)<p>I am quite ambivalent about the situation. I am happy that my school is getting some attention at this end of the world. but I don't know how I feel about the change in the kind of students we attract and will have as alumni.",1289177365

<i>Day-to-day</i><p><pre><code>    Until last month I was using a 15"" i5 MBPro with 6GB of ram, and an 
    SSD for my day-to-day needs and development, but the weight was 
    starting to get to me. So following the recommendations a few weeks 
    ago in a HN thread about development laptops, I purchased a Lenovo 
    X201 for my day-to-day needs. I dual-boot between Windows 7 (for ASM 
    work, and other work that I need Windows for) and Ubuntu 10.10 (main 
    OS, sysadmin work, development work). For anyone else considering a 
    X201, do it! It's a great setup, the screen resolution is not a 
    problem at all (coming from someone who went to a hi-res 15"" MBP from 
    a 13"" for the screen resolution upgrade) and 10.10 worked flawlessly 
    out of the box.

<i>Software</i><p><pre><code>    On Windows, I use InType for my texteditor, combined with ExpanDrive 
    for remote editing.

    On Ubuntu, I use Scribes as my primary texteditor, vim when working 
    in command line. No need for ExpanDrive in Ubuntu as Nautilus 
    supports SSH bookmarks. Tilda is a great utility if you need to be 
    able to pull up a Terminal window quickly, similar to Visor in OS X.

Eliot's version is better rhythmically. It introduces a tiny extra pause between ""human"" and ""kind"", and it sounds better that way. (One particular way in which it sounds better: the slight slow-down makes it that bit more magisterial, which is part of its appeal.)<p>2. Eliot's version suggests an individual human rather than the species as a whole, which makes better sense: the human race, as such, can neither bear nor fail to bear very much reality, but individual humans certainly can.<p>3. Eliot's version, by its slight unfamiliarity, encourages the mind to dwell a bit more on the associations of those words, the latter especially. Kin. Kindness. German <i>Kind</i>, a child (children typically can't bear very much reality either).<p>[EDITED a minute or two after posting to fix formatting; no changes in content]",1289176762

Sorry if I don't make much sense--I'm coming down with a fever. :(<p>Who am I?:  I'm a mechanical engineering grad student at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.  My most interesting projects to-date are probably my thesis and an IRC bot that runs on node.js.<p>What Hardware Am I Using?:  At home, I use a used Dell Mini 9.  I really like it, though it chokes on some Java apps (minecraft) and some visually intensive stuff. It also only has about 6 GB of SSD, so space often becomes an issue. Awesome battery life, though!<p>I used to have a desktop, but it recently died and I'm not really willing to spend the money to fix it yet.  At work, I have an older Dell Dimension with dual 19"" (or so) screens.<p>I also just recently bought a Linode instance. I've found having a server accessible over ssh is really really handy.<p>And what software?: I'm running Fedora 12 on both my work computer and my laptop. I previously ran Ubuntu, but my boss gave me a Fedora disk and I decided to give it a shot.  It's alright, though I've decided that I like apt-get better. Long ago, I used to dual boot windows on my old desktop, but I found that I hate having to reboot, and most of the time there isn't really anything on the windows computer that I want, excepting for the odd game or two. But Linux is getting better for games anyway, especially the casual types that I tend to play these days.<p>For browsing, I use Google Chrome (v8 <3), and for text editing, I tend to use either vim or gedit depending on my mood and the context.  I prefer writing papers using LaTeX, and I actually adore Gnumeric for spreadsheets.  I tend to use python/numpy for data crunching (and ipython for testing out ideas and as a calculator), and node.js for my side-projects. I haven't really used node.js for any serious projects yet, but as a toy I really like it. On the netbook I use xmonad for window management (netbooks and xmonad make a great combination), but on my ""workstation"" I've stuck with metacity. For image editing, I tend to use Gimp, though I've been trying to get into Inkscape lately. I've also considered PGF/Tikz but haven't gotten around to it.<p>What Is My Dream Setup?<p>If my netbook had like three times the storage, I'd be pretty happy with it.  In an ideal world, I'd have a workstation and a massive desk (similar to what I have at work but with more ponies) as well. I also wish I had my own scanner again.<p>When it comes to software, I'd wish apps came with defaults that suited my workflow. For example, vim's defaults (on Fedora) don't really do it for me, but I've been too lazy to change them myself. I know, I know. I also wish there wasn't such a delineation between operating system-based software ecosystems. While I love the Linux ecosystem, there's some stuff on the Mac side of things (and on Windows too--for example, Irfanview), and it's a shame that you have to pick your programs based on your OS (or whatever virtualization you decide to run).<p>When it comes to UI, I wish there wasn't such a fine line between the Real World and the Computer World.  The reason I wish I had a huge desk is because I tend to work in piles and scraps of paper. I'm really messy in the Real World, but it works for me.  While I'm not terribly disappointed in computing these days, it'd be really awesome if computer use and desk use somehow mashed together a bit better.<p>Finally, I want really fast internet.  While ""cloud"" is definitely a buzzword, I'm really liking the idea of having my computers being this sort of abstract thing, where I don't have to consider there being an actual box in my house somewhere, and the lower latency is between you and your servers, the better integration can be between The Cloud and your ""thin clients"" (such as my netbook).",1289174502

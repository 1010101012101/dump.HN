With more dynamic, weak type systems, more tests must exist to achieve a similar level of guarantees. For me, this all seems vaguely similar to when people argued about garbage collectors v. manually managed memory and it&#x27;s become more that you&#x27;ve traded one set of problems for another, and as far as pragmatic engineering goes I think that&#x27;s perfectly fine as long as we&#x27;re better equipped to handle the new problems.<p>But yes, I&#x27;ll take strong tests mostly because I can only spend so much time verifying that a type system aligns with my business logic (granted, QuickCheck is neat but requires a high price in flexibility of language choices)  and I&#x27;d rather take the approach of weaker type systems with partial correctness than the oftentimes all-or-nothing demands of a rigorously structured business framework within a mathematically oriented language.

This is absolutely and completely correct. For every compound that makes to the clinic, there are 1000s that fail at the preclinical or clinical stages: worst case in Phase III when 100s of millions of dollars have already been spent on it. India, in its shortsighted view, is refusing to acknowledge the effort and money that goes into bringing a molecule to the clinic.
India is notoriously shortsighted when it comes to biomedical research. Here&#x27;s a classic example: In response to a Texas company that tried to patent an indigenous Basmati species under the name Texmati, the govt imposed a blanket ban on the export of any indigenous DNA outside. What is the result of that? When the global HAPMAP projects began to genotype humans of all races and ethnicity and trace human history, Indians couldn&#x27;t be genotyped because of the (Texmati) DNA law. HAPMAP ended up recruiting Indians living in US and UK. Now when the world is starting to reap some of the benefits of HAPMAP, India is at the forefront criticizing &quot;bullies&quot; like the US for not paying attention to diseases with restricted incidence in, say, India.",1422161158

8942054,comment,8940116,8941263,0,0,Animats,,,"The design decisions behind Rust are good ones. The ones that matter here are:<p>1.  Null references are undesirable. Good decision.
2.  Exceptions are undesirable.  Arguable, but not bad.
3.  There should be some way to optionally return a null 
    result from a function.   Reasonable enough.
4.  Functional composition is good, allowing one to write
       h(g(f(a)))  Standard in most languages.
5.  Object method syntax is good, allowing one to write 
       a.f().g().h()
    to compose functions.  Standard in most languages.
6.  Types are determined at compile time.  Required for speed.
7.  Function overloading based on parameter types is bad.<p>There are unintended consequences of these decisions.  The Option<T> wrapper type can have a value of None, which is not a type to which methods can be applied.  So, for functions that return Option, the common &quot;a.f().g().h()&quot; form won&#x27;t work. Workarounds are available, but they&#x27;re either wordy (&quot;&#x27;if let&#x27; and a couple of extra lines&quot;) or obscure (using a closure as shown in the example).<p>It may be better in such cases to avoid an object-oriented style, and do composition as
&quot;h(g(f(a)))&quot;.  If all the functions take Option inputs and return Option outputs, None can be passed through the chain of functions by having each function return None if the input is None.  Because Rust doesn&#x27;t support function overloading for plain functions, the names have to be unique within the namespace, so you can&#x27;t have both &quot;f(a: f64) => Option<f64>&quot; and &quot;f(a: Option<f64>) => Option<f64>&quot;.

For example, African Americans make up 13.2% of the US population and have a unique history and music, their own vernacular (AAVE), etc. We should seek to preserve these diverse cultural identities, but they are generally lost in families where the parents come from different cultural/racial groups. For example, if the current generation chooses mates without regard to race then in the next generation only 1.74% of offspring will have two African American parents.

(I&#x27;m actually in the middle of a major update to the page — I hope to have it published in a few weeks)<p>I used d3.js for this page (and most of the pages on my site).<p>For a given shape of map (rectangular, triangular, hexagonal, parallelogram, etc.) I generate a set of cube hex coordinates. I then use d3 to instantiate an SVG shape for each coordinate. D3 will maintain the mapping from the cube coordinate to the SVG shape, so I can set element classes on mouse events, and then I style those with CSS.<p>For example, in the line drawing example, I have a generic function that creates a hexagonal shaped grid (of hexagons)[1]. On mouseover, I figure out which hex it is, then run the line drawing algorithm to create a set of coordinates from the start point to the hex you&#x27;re pointing to. I then tell d3 to iterate over all the SVG dom nodes and set the &quot;selected&quot; class if it&#x27;s in the set returned by the line drawing routine[2]. The color changes with the CSS rule #diagram-line .selected polygon {fill: hsl(200, 50%, 80%); }<p>I&#x27;ve used canvas for some of the pages but I find svg much easier to work with. I can attach mouse events to the elements, and I can set properties (such as color) easily without redrawing everything. D3 is great for maintaining a mapping from data (such as a set of hex coordinates) to dom nodes (such as a set of svg <polygon>s). D3 also has transitions, but I think most of my needs could be handled with CSS transitions instead of D3&#x27;s JS transitions.<p>[1] See <a href=""http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/Grid.hx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/Grid.hx</a> : hexagonalShape()

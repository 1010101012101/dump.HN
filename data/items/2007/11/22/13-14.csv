82739,comment,82519,82694,0,0,boucher,,,""" However you represent it, you still need a way to say that you want a 1px border, a certain font, links that get bigger when you mouse over them and so on. There's a whole model there which can certainly be abstracted into something else, but that something else won't necessarily be simpler (it will, however, be non-standard).""<p>The thing is, is that really what people who are building applications need to figure out?  Yes, they probably need access to changing these properties, but the vast majority of what you are doing when you are writing an actual application on the web is far more complicated then setting a few class properties on some divs.  <p>It isn't so much about compressing this, as it is about throwing out this broken architecture.  HTML/CSS are great technologies for page layout.  In fact, I have a perverse love for them which I am unable to explain, let alone understand.  But they suck when it comes to dynamic, application like behaviors.  We need a new technology.  And yes, while it won't be a w3c or whatwg standard, if its open source, who cares?  I, for one, am tired of relying on browser manufacturers to get things done.",1195739126

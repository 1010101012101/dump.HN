My post was not meant to be considered 'Jason hate mail'. I was simply saying why I fundamentally disagree with Jason's core work ethic principles.<p>We fully agree on letting the free market decide. Time will tell on that one.<p>What's very interesting about your blogpost, is that all those activities you list (afternoons off to go to the beach and play SC2, etc.) run contrary to Jason's public statements.<p>When he says, he expects you to be a 'Samurai' and work '80 hour weeks constantly'...that doesn't indicate afternoons off...so my entire post was based on what he says. If he does something different, then that might be totally reasonable. But given that I don't work there and don't know anyone that does (personally) I can only go on what he says.<p>So given that you are now shedding another light on it, that's good because it shows us what REALLY goes on. Not what Jason SAYS goes on.<p>Also, I am shocked, to say the least, that you actually have a life outside of work. Because according to Jason, anyone that does so is 'weak and normal'. He is 'strong and abnormal'. So that, again, contradicts with what he is saying.<p>I am happy for you, that you can have it and I think you should. In fact, I don't mind doing your bidding and publicly berating Jason for taking things too far, so he can ease up on you guys :) - because I don't believe when he takes away those things, that your performance goes up. Morale as well as performance must go down as it is unsustainable in the long run.<p>Also, just another quick note...I reject the notion that in order to produce anything 'great' you have to be prepared to work more than anyone else. If we look at this statement in it's extremes, that would mean that people in countries with dictators would produce much better/more innovative stuff than the Valley. Because they can literally lock people up in prisons and force them to do X work (i.e. programming, or anything they want) for more hours in a day, for a much longer period than a western government would allow. That has not worked, to date, because excellence cannot be brute forced. It can only be achieved through continual refinement.<p>Also, if 'great products' can only be achieved by working more than anyone else, then by that definition we would never have Rails or any other wonderful open source project/technology that came out of the spare hours of the creator. DHH famously says that he only worked on Basecamp for about 10 hours per week, and Rails was even less than that because it was done after he had worked on everything else. There are countless other OSS examples.<p>That's just my $0.02.",1291589663

Like, say, capital gains from investment in a small business.<p>That's not a full explanation (or even a meaningful one), just an example of how different provisions can interact to give results that are no obvious when they're taken in isolation.

The recent backlash against personalized DNA testing shows that regulators are looking forward to squashing that as well.<p>Waits are long now and will be longer in the future. Doctors are harried now and will be more harried in the future.<p>Most speciality medical care (other than plastic surgery and other borderline areas that people willingly pay out of pocket for) is a financial racket akin to the banking fiasco.  The AMA keeps supply of specialists low to keep salaries high, and battles are fought over regulations that lead to more billable procedures, gaming of the medicare system, etc.<p>Many commonly used procedures and drugs have very little effect and drain money from society.  If you think critically and read the studies you will realize this.  Then consider the Billions being paid the respected specialists who do these mostly useless procedures.  Consider the influence they have in hospital policy and government policy.<p>Medicine in the US is a phenomenon of the American psyche.  We have too much faith in the latest buzzword or technology to solve our problems, and we want to cheat death. Meanwhile, medical diagnoses are the only validation provided to so many desperate souls whose miserable lives are spent in constant complaint and agony, defined by their illness.<p>So many doctors traffic in the misery of these people, and the institution of medicine legitimizes it (for profit).<p>There are some niche areas where science is actually making amazing progress (some kinds of cancer research, mostly) but overall the medical class (those enriched by the status quo) are exploiters of human vulnerability, hope, and malaise.<p>Yes there are some amazing doctors and most I've met are incredibly hard working, caring people.  But there are so many lies so deeply ingrained into our system that it will be hard ever to change it.<p>If you're a 60 year old man with significant arterial blockage, it's considered normal.

The three objects (user, book, and review) should be cached separately, so you can use them in the duplicate places around your site. Of course, where you have a list of items to get users or books from, you will want to query your cache and DB using multi_get or in (id_1, id_2, ..).<p>The idea behind these scalable sets are that we end up caching our data differently than how we store the same data in a relational set.

There are some pretty obvious relationships between bugs, authors, commenters and comments.<p>Imagine a bug that has 100 comments from as many commenters.

1972913,comment,1972344,1972344,0,0,tzs,,,"I looked into using some kind of NoSQL solution at work, and one thing puzzles me. Assume a key/value database, where values are JSON documents or something similar.<p>Using such a database, with the key being customer account ID, and the value being a document that contains all the information about that customer's account would be convenient and useful. Information about the account would include things like name, address, email, status of the account, when their subscription to our service expires, re-billing information, all their purchases, and so on.<p>This would definitely be a lot more convenient than our current SQL-based solution for two of the three things we do with our customer data.<p>One of those things is display a customer's information for our customer support people when they are dealing with the customer on the phone, or working on a ticket in our help desk. With the NoSQL, it would be a simple get the JSON document for that customer, and display it nicely.<p>The second thing is providing information to the installed software on the end user's computer. Our software provides a service that can partly be done locally, and partly requires back end support. All the back end information needed to support a given customer's installed software would be in that JSON document, so again the key/value store would work great.<p>However, I'm at a loss as to how the third thing would be handled efficiently: reporting.<p>For instance, suppose I'm asked for a quick report on how well a new SKU has sold over the last week. With our SQL database, this is a trivial select from the ""orders"" and ""line_items"" table. It is almost instantaneous. With the NoSQL solution, it would appear that I would have to go look at every single customer's entry.<p>All in all, we've got a couple dozen regular reports, many running hourly, and a few being interactive on-demand via a web interface, that are fairly straightforward and efficient in our SQL-based solution (some might involve joining 6 or 7 tables, but it is still straightforward and efficient).<p>Thus, at first glance, it would seem that going to NoSQL would be a nightmare for my reports. Many times an hour, it would appear that the database would get slammed by reports that would have to be accessing every freaking record in the database. That doesn't sound like something that's going to make me happy.<p>How do people deal with reporting when using NoSQL?",1291587751

Likewise, a group of players is in Nash equilibrium if each one is making the best decision that he or she can, taking into account the decisions of the others. However, Nash equilibrium does not necessarily mean the best cumulative payoff for all the players involved; in many cases all the players might improve their payoffs if they could somehow agree on strategies different from the Nash equilibrium (e.g., competing businesses forming a cartel in order to increase their profits).<p>That's not what my theory says.<p>The main thrust of my theory is that the players actually improve their payoffs if they make the best decisions (for themselves) that he or she can - without taking into account the decisions of the others. Because I believe, and this has to be tested of course, that if both parties do that, it will result in the best cumulative payoff for all the players involved. As opposed to the Nash equilibrium that 'encourages' players to do things like forming a cartel to improve profits - because in my theory, doing that will only lead to their eventual downfall because at some point another firm will do what is in it's own self-interest and expose the cartel. So everybody in the cartel would be worst off, but the one firm that sheds light on it, would be better off. It's an extreme version of virtuosity through extreme selfishness (if that makes any sense).<p>It could be that I got my theory from somewhere and just don't know the actual name, and if I did I would love to find that name.

On the one hand, it seems bad, that instead of having the freedom to exercise situation-specific judgment, doctors are increasingly being pressured to follow predefined flow charts and rubrics, turning it into a sort of cookie-cutter medicine. On the other hand, the statistical evidence in some cases is actually pretty good: for at least a few kinds of things that have been tested, doctors who mindlessly follow a validated process have, on average, better outcomes than the more traditional approach. One explanation that's been advanced for that is that humans are not very good at conditional probabilities, so doctors often make intuitive decisions that, if you run the numbers, aren't statistically the best choice, based on available data.

I don't think a shortage of people willing to review papers is going to be a problem, and if it is, it's a problem that could easily be solved by the prestigious open access journals requiring those submitting papers to set aside time to participate in the peer review process of others' papers",1291586635

Not sure about the 6-degrees-of-separation thing, but it's probably on the order of that.<p>The greater problem of a distributed system would be public key revocation, because you have to go through your entire contacts list to publish a new key.",1291586546

Most of the ones that keep showing up for me are very old. Is everybody else experiencing that?<p>It also seems like the order of the photos is somewhat randomized when I go to view all of my photos (as opposed to being reverse chronological order). Weird.",1291586463

They've proven themselves so untrustworthy in this regard that even the updates that seem like they shouldn't have privacy effects need to be audited; and of course it doesn't matter that a particular update doesn't have a privacy violation, because you still need to run the audit to be sure.",1291586421

In fact, it was probably on the example of Amazon that Apple was able to make such a demand (""look, the music industry hasn't imploded yet"").<p>Also, while Apple does sell DRM-free files, access to their store requires iTunes - not exactly DRM, but a vendor tie-in that limits your access to the store and your purchased music.  Contrast with Amazon, whereas you can buy/download tracks from your browser.",1352743101

We were making software to generate web sites for commercial art galleries (who didn't want web sites).  So we didn't suddenly decide to write software to make stores.  It was more a question of switching to a market that wanted what we could make.<p>Robert's apartment was not in NYC.  I was the one who lived in NYC, and I was visiting him in Cambridge.<p>I didn't wake up with a specific sentence in my head.  I just woke up with the idea that we might be able to control the software on the server by clicking on links.<p>It's an overstatement to say that the idea of Viaweb was too strong to fail.  We came close to failing several times.  It is true though that the best thing we had going for us was the quality of the software (rather than, say, marketing, or connections).<p>We weren't the only ones ""insane enough"" to make web-based software.  At least one of our competitors did.  It was a big help though that our most dangerous competitor took a long time to grasp the idea.<p>The story about the origins of YC omits Jessica.  We decided to start it one night while we were walking back from dinner in Harvard Square (<a href=""http://ycombinator.com/start.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/start.html</a>).<p>Robert never devoted his time exclusively to YC.  Jessica and I did, but he and Trevor have always done it part time.<p>As far as I know, no one has ever tried to put a valuation on YC.  You could value our current assets fairly precisely, but that would come to less than 500m.",1352743064

I expected at least a <i>few</i> of the big brands to offer apps - but no Spotify, no Rdio, no Pandora (making the device musically useless), no Yelp, no Facebook... makes me wonder what exactly the point of the device is for the average user.<p>The browser on the Surface is the best I've ever used on a mobile device. It is <i>fast</i>, responsive, and unlike iOS tabbed browsing feels like a first-class feature instead of an afterthought. Compatibility with desktop sites is also top-notch.<p>So really what I have sitting on my desk right now is a touch-based browsing machine with an ingenious keyboard... and not much else. I love the design on this thing, and I really want the whole ""powerhouse tablet"" notion to take off, but there are so many pieces missing that I just don't see how.<p>Side note: after playing with the SDK for a weekend I'm starting to come to the realization that MS's dev ecosystem may be a liability for them. I've been thinking about putting together some easy apps that would provide some basic expected functionality (IM?), but the open source ecosystem essentially does not exist at all in the .NET world. I've run into page after page of commercial, proprietary libs to do even reasonably basic things and scant few open source ones I can take advantage of.<p>Both iOS and Android have benefited tremendously from a large, comprehensive open source stack making the lives of app builders easier. Win8 in its current state feels like I need to invent the internal combustion engine to build a car.",1352742869

There are other kinds of fraud to watch for but let's focus on this for now.<p>If Gittip does nothing, then stolen money gets into Gittip, and some portion of that is reported to the banks, and Gittip gets hit with chargebacks. Chargebacks are financially onerous, and if Gittip gets too many of them then we'll lose our privileges with the banks altogether. Moreover, chargebacks take months to hit. It's neither economical nor efficient to use chargebacks as the primary signal for bad accounts. Therefore, I don't see a choice but to try to predict which accounts are going to inject stolen money into Gittip before it happens.<p>Once stolen money is in Gittip, some of that goes to good accounts and some to bad.

For example, the article explains that:<p>""The desert kingdom is due to become the biggest producer again by 2030, pumping 11.4 million barrels a day versus 10.2 million in the U.S.""<p>That said, if the numbers and projections are accurate, then the U.S. will still be producing, but the output will be lower, largely because of changes in the sources of energy:<p>""'In the United States, low prices and abundant supply see gas overtake oil around 2030 to become the largest fuel in the energy mix,' according to the report, written by a team of researchers led by Birol.""<p>On the topic of running out of oil, I have always wondered (just a theory for discussion here): maybe oil will never physically run out, but rather what will happen is that once all of the easily-accessible supplies have been expended, it will simply become so cost-prohibitive to extract that we will eventually be forced to change and adapt. Hopefully we will change sooner than later. (Also, when I say ""we"", I mean all of us as humans, not a specific country).<p>Edit: Thanks for responding roc and checker.

Per litre, not gallon!<p>So people get around town on little mopeds, motorbikes, small cars and a lot of SMART cars around as well. I agree there is a lot of forward momentum with hybrid/electric cars in terms on technological advancement, but the uptake in the US is abysmal. Just because you drive an electric car does not mean there is no CO2, that electricity needs to be generated from somewhere and unless that source is renewable energy then you are back to square one. But it's not just cars you need to think about: generation of electricity, airplanes, ships, cheap exports from the rest of the world... I remember reding a study a few years ago stating that shipping outputs a lot more CO2 than air travel. Also, ships use the cheapest, nastiest, left over fuel from the refinement process so ends up throwing our more CO2.

Solar angle varies throughout the day but let's integrate for a south-facing building in North American latitudes and we get a power factor of about 0.5 over the course of a day so we're back at 23W/m^2. of electrical energy from these films.<p>They're going to have to be exceedingly inexpensive to make this effort worthwhile.<p>[1] <a href=""http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/spectra/am1.5/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/spectra/am1.5/</a>

6909960,comment,6909620,6909620,8,0,undoware,,,"Anecdotal experience deploying in the lab with NixOS and/or Nix:<p>1. At the time, I was maintaining several heterogenous RPM-based systems, so that was the comparison. I can say with some limited authority that it&#x27;s easier to make NixOS packages than RPMs, but harder than (say) tweaking /usr/ports in a BSD or Gentoo.<p>2. Being able to send closures between machines -- i.e. a reproducible recipe for the user&#x27;s current environment, including all installed and user-acccessible packages, libs and binaries -- is eerie, like alien technology. Think of &#x27;nvm&#x27; or &#x27;virtualenv&#x27;, but granular, and for everything. Once you get used to it, you will never be happy with any other package manager.<p>3. Nix&#x27; independence from NixOS is both a blessing and curse . On every OS except NixOS, Nix is necessarily a third-party add-on, and it necessarily uses slightly different versions of everything. Thanks to some insanely clever environment management, this never causes things to go plink, but it <i>does</i> mean that I often had a choice between a fresh Fedora  RPM -- <i>on a Fedora machine</i> -- and a slightly stale Nix package. Guess which worked better. Guess which I chose most of the time. (But if you guessed that I was a bit OCD about package freshness, you&#x27;d be right.)<p>4. Final drawback, and the reason NixOS hasn&#x27;t yet made it into production at our company: NixOS itself obviously has to use the same slightly stale packages that Nix does. \n  That said, how upset can you really get? These guys don&#x27;t have the dev-hours that Canonical or Red Hat do -- or even Debian, for that matter. What they have achieved with the resources at hand is mindblowing. What this project needs to really be useful to me is about two dozen new FOSS contributors and like maybe half a million dollars of investment. Any more than that, though, and I&#x27;d worry they&#x27;d lose their game ;D -- so much of it is based on doing immense amounts with almost nothing, using cleverness as the amplifier. Isn&#x27;t that what it&#x27;s all about?<p>5. Oh, and also, the devs are responsive. Hi guys! ;D",1387126601
6909959,comment,6909607,6909696,5,0,mmahemoff,,,"Arguably a more maintainable technique would be to use multiple classes and define, e.g. a &quot;brand&quot; class just for this color, so you can have a simpler standalone rule:<p><pre><code>    .brand {\n      color: #bada55;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nSee OOCSS for more details.<p>While that&#x27;s good practice, it&#x27;s a challenge to get it right on a large legacy systems, so I still find variables useful in practice.

6909951,comment,6908305,6909890,2,0,ek,,,"Note that fmap writes: &quot;Equality of rational numbers is decidable, which means that classical reasoning is provable. And yes, even if it wasn&#x27;t, it would still work.&quot;<p>What is meant by &quot;even if it wasn&#x27;t, it would still work&quot; goes back to something he said earlier: type theory embeds an infinite hierarchy of axioms of choice and laws of excluded middles. If you want to do propositional-like reasoning in homotopy type theory, you can assume AC or LEM for homotopy (-1)-types, corresponding to propositional logic.<p>In type theory you are <i>encouraged</i> to drop the law of the excluded middle and the axiom of choice, because of the fact that doing so gives you potentially more expressive ways of doing things as we have said, but you have gotten the impression that you <i>have</i> to, which you don&#x27;t.<p>Also, the claim in this thread was that the results from classical mathematics are <i>provable</i> using homotopy type theory, not that they are provable in the same way (though that holds as well, as I&#x27;ve said above; it&#x27;s just that the mathematics might not look as clean as if you did it in a more idiomatic way). This kind of a value proposition is not exactly new: category theory loses certain axioms over set theory and mathematicians adapted to the point that category theory is now the language of modern algebra.<p>I want to point out that I suggested that you read the introduction to the book because it provides these same answers to the questions you are wondering about. I still suggest you do so, as it goes into more detail on what we have said here in a way that I am not able to quite as well.",1387126420

It honestly depends more on the individual than the language.<p>Individual 1: They were interested in history, video games, politics and desired to learn programming. For him, he seemed more interested in the history of programming, so I chose to help him learn BASIC as his first language simply because of the history associated with it (I could have chose FORTRAN or COBOL). He enjoyed it more because he could connect, he thrived off imagining the other early programmers writing in BASIC. Further, he felt as if he was building and learning in a similar fashion to most programmers and that made him want to learn more languages advancing in a similar fashion.<p>Individual 2: For her, NetLogo was the simple choice. She understood nothing of programming and honestly did not want to at the time, but knew she needed programming knowledge to help her obtain a job in biology in the future. NetLogo offered a way to both teach her the basics of programming (objects, loops, etc.) while being pretty fun, we made an eco-system. This actually excited her about programming to the extent that she is now learning python and joined ACM.<p>Individual 3: For him Ruby was probably the best introduction to programming, he was interested in learning how to develop website applications. Due to the fact he had no programming experience and was interested in web applications it seemed clear (to me) that Ruby was going to be the easiest way for him to learn to program. He loved it, and has since moved on to learning C, since it turns out he loved the control programming offers him.<p>The point, is that each programming language has a community/documentation and specific uses, it depends on personality and what ones goals are when determining what language to learn first. Since I have always been interested in both improving myself and others I have read a few books on the subject, my favorite is The Talent Code [1]. The book explains that each person has a different personality/experiences and in turn &quot;learn best&quot; in different ways, which is essentially what I employed here (without explicitly meaning to).<p>I agree with the author that Python (in many cases) is the best language to have a want-to-be programmer learn.

That one doesn&#x27;t seem to have been webbed as a single page, but you can go to the book pdf, search for &quot;the stability problem&quot; in the index and click the link to jump right there. <a href=\"http://www.daviddfriedman.com/The_Machinery_of_Freedom_.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.daviddfriedman.com/The_Machinery_of_Freedom_.pdf</a><p>From the intro:\n> <i>Anyone with a little imagination can dream up a radical new structure for society, anarcho-capitalist or otherwise.\nThe question is, will it work? Most people, when they hear my description of anarcho-capitalism for the first time, immediately explain to me two or three reasons why it won&#x27;t. Most of their arguments can be reduced to two: The system will be at the mercy of the mafia, which can establish its own &#x27;protection agency&#x27; or take over existing ones and\nconvert them into protection rackets. Or else the protection agencies will realize that theft is more profitable than\nbusiness, get together, and become a government.</i><p>The text that follows explores and answers that objection, always keeping in mind that <i>utopia is not an option</i> - our existing system already <i>is</i> a cartel that screws its customers in many ways and is very hard to hold accountable for its actions. &quot;perfect&quot; isn&#x27;t an option, but &quot;better&quot; might be achievable.",1387124614

If the air conditioner suddenly turned off everyone would notice how loud the air conditioner really was the whole time. This is similar to what ADHD was like for me. It wasn&#x27;t until it was gone and then suddenly back that I finally started to grasp its real affects on me.<p>I spent most my life post high school life wondering if I had &quot;ADHD&quot;. In high school I was clueless. I didn&#x27;t know any one who had ADHD or about the disease. I just assumed I was super lazy. So even though I was feeling horrible everyday, because it was everyday: I couldn&#x27;t compare it to anything. I just assumed I was feeling normal.<p>In fact there was so much stigma about &quot;Is ADHD real, do I really have it?&quot;. Even after I was able to turn it off and then back on, at first I really didn&#x27;t accept that it was that different. I was in major denial (I wanted to take responsibility for my laziness and not blame some &quot;fake&quot; disease). It wasn&#x27;t until I was on Paleo full time for about 6 months and then I had a piece of bread and the horrible feelings started rushing back into my brain that I started to finally admit to myself that ADHD is real and that I have it.<p>And then my girl friend started to point out and get upset every time I cheated on Paleo because I would turn in to &quot;Mr. Hyde&quot; being rude, immature and very annoying. At first she hated the idea of me trying some fad diet. She loves cooking and hated what this change meant. Now she is my biggest cheerleader. Partially for my happiness, but to a large degree for her own.<p>So I can I can identify with a lot of the people who are advocating ADHD isn&#x27;t a real disease, I was there. I can also say that attitude of shaming people (blaming the persons attitude, will power and not their brain chemistry), really fucked me up, to the point where I couldn&#x27;t admit to myself how real the disease is for a long time. I went on and off Paleo for about 8 months before I finally, told my self this helps enough to be worth while. From my relapses, I can tell you it helps me in HUGE, HUGE way. I was in a lot of denial.<p>I also want to point out for me it was hard to admit that Paleo actually proved I had ADHD (I am not just super lazy). Years of beating myself up made this very hard. So if you do decide to try paleo, do it for at least 30 days. Keep a journal of how you feel at least once a week and then on the 30th day eat a bunch of bread, milk and sugar and journal how you feel. Try to get some work done. If you actually have the same allergy I have, the sooner you fully accept it the sooner you will start to heal the emotional wounds.",1387124126

I don&#x27;t think GP was using &quot;culture&quot; as an excuse for anyone&#x27;s behaviour; rather I read it as a suggestion that maybe <i>in addition to</i> personal culpability, there are cultural problems in place which perpetuate/encourage/condone bad behaviour. Doesn&#x27;t sound like horseshit to me, at least not in the obvious sense which you seem to suggest. (FWIW, I might also forego the &quot;alpha/omega&quot; labels, but that&#x27;s a small nit to pick.)<p>The last part of your comment almost seems orthogonal to that; &quot;whether or not there is a problematic culture in place, there are also crazy people alive, and the internet gives them a platform&quot;.",1387123515

If you are looking for a general solution, it should be one that can handle LCR circuits, mass-spring systems, etc., though that is probably too much for an introductory course.  My real point is that there is nothing to be gained by modeling circuit components or even circuits as objects -- you do not improve maintainability, you do not encourage code reuse, and you do increase the amount of code that does nothing to solve the problem.",1387123490

Someone more interested in dismissing my ideas than in learning what they were could just as easily say &quot;Effective Schooling is a known advocate of single-sex education, and can therefore not be trusted to report on the issue&quot; (indeed, people say this all the time).  The fact that someone is willing to tell you what his ideas are doesn&#x27;t automatically make them bad ones.

6909782,comment,6909326,6909453,3,0,DSMan195276,,,"I would agree - I&#x27;m current in a college CS program (I have ~6 years of programming experience already, so the introductory stuff is a breeze). The <i>very</i> first programming class we took was &quot;Intro to Object-Oriented programming in Java&quot;. The irony is that a good 3/4&#x27;s of the final projects people turned in where just a big mess of procedural static methods and global variables all shoved into the single &#x27;required&#x27; class to hold main(). There were some who after going through the class understood OOP a bit more then they used to, but those were really just people who already had some programming experience. Those who came into the program with no experience were still trying to figure out the basics of procedural stuff (&#x27;This is how a for loop works&#x27;, &#x27;this is an int, it&#x27;s not an object&#x27;, &#x27;i = i + 1 is a valid statement&#x27;, while() vs. do while(), etc...) (And are <i>still</i> trying to figure that stuff out even now, though now a bit more complex issues, a year later, since it was never really taught that well)<p>I think the biggest thing that stuck-out to me as being utterly wrong with teaching Java and OOP is that you&#x27;re forced to talk about references/pointers extremely early on, when most of the students don&#x27;t have enough grasp on the core language to understand them conceptually (And really, who understands a reference/pointer the first time they heard about it? let alone 2 months after starting programming).<p>I honestly think starting off with C would have been better, and I don&#x27;t view C as a good beginners language. But C itself has a pretty simple core language, and writing small procedural programs in it isn&#x27;t very hard to conceptualize, so it requires a minimal amount of hand-waving to get simple programs running. (Hello &#x27;public static void main(String args[])&#x27;) The biggest hurdle would probably be string handling, as it&#x27;s an array of char&#x27;s. If you&#x27;re not concerned with buffer overflows though, simple stack-allocated arrays work fine for tons of simple introductory programs, and <string.h> provides enough to get by without messing with any pointers.",1387123329

First he'd have to fix a bunch of stupid mistakes like leaving Activation/Blizzard (they are two separate groups that are just own by the same company), and claiming to be working with Disney (what happens when someone at Disney asks who this idiot claiming to be associated with them is.)  Probably, most damming though was his claim to already have funding for a AAA title but still needing an extra $80K overall the numbers just don't add up.  This is a really tight spot if he asks for too much money it is more likely funding will fail or that people will investigate his claims.  Too little money and he doesn't sound credible.<p>Second the game concept was incredibly vague about a game that was supposedly already in production.  Making big vague promises should always be a warning sign of scam.  Conversely when Double Fine did their campaign it was okay that gave gave no details about the game because, 1 it hadn't been started yet, 2 they actually explicitly stated that the game might suck.  Coming up with a real good detailed game concept is actually pretty hard.<p>Next the studio and team wer never shown.  Instead you see one young guy sitting at a desk in a poorly lit room with no windows, and a laptop running some stupid animation on it.  In other videos we walked though real offices with real people with names, and real workstations that actually look like they are in use.<p>These last two are going to be very difficult to fake as they require a reputation, accomplices, and money, which scam artists tend to lack.

3905201,comment,3904972,3905063,19,0,zred,,,"Palm bought BeOS for $11M (and those assets were later transfered to PalmSource which became Access).<p>In 2001 (when BeOS was bought), it might have made a bit of sense.  Be was pretty modern then - competing against Windows XP and either the Classic Mac OS which it was far better than or OS X which was very new and so incredibly slow it was nearly unusable - I don't miss those days being a Mac user.  However, in 2001 it had just been bought.  Palm wasn't going to turn around and say ""we spent $11M on this, you guys want it on the cheap?""<p>Today, Haiku has probably surpassed BeOS in any relevant way.  The issue is that the world has moved on.  Imagine a really well-made car/engine from 1990 (and imagine that it was like code which doesn't corrode and such).  It can still be a great car today in many respects - maybe its performance characteristics still make it a lot nicer than many modern cars.  However, you then start thinking about how it doesn't have anti-lock brakes, traction control, electronic slip protection, air bags, a CD player, iPod hookup, bluetooth; plus, it has a an analog carphone installed in the center.  That's a bit like was BeOS would be like today.<p>For example, Haiku just got preliminary WPA support in October.  Frankly, if an operating system doesn't have wonderful WiFi support, it's missing a key practical piece for me.  Likewise, other operating systems have put considerable energy into compositing window managers to provide things people take for granted today like shadows, transparency, minimization effects, etc.  Plus, and this is pure speculation since I haven't used Haiku recently enough to really comment, I'm guessing the web browser ports aren't quite as mature/good as they are for other systems that have a lot more users/developers.<p>So, licensing the BeOS IP isn't the issue.  It would basically be buying an operating system that hasn't been updated since Windows XP came out.  Sure, Windows XP isn't terrible today, but part of that is because Microsoft continued to update and maintain it since its release in 2001.  Even then, it seems old.<p>If BeOS was open-sourced in 2001, it might have seen decent adoption.  It had a nice GUI, was really ready for the multi-core processors to come, and it might have gotten the traction to see things like Mozilla concentrate on it as a platform.  When OpenBeOS (Haiku's former name) started, I think there was a lot of hope.  Of course, as they were concentrating on replicating BeOS R5, the world moved on and Apple, Microsoft, and the Linux community had an army of programmers working on advancing their systems while Haiku had a small team trying to resurrect their beloved system.  BeOS was very advanced for its day and in some ways I think it's still better, but BeOS today would just be old in many practical ways even if it was awesome in many other ways.",1335677423

3905181,comment,3902758,3902758,2,0,waveman,,,"This is so retarded.<p>Everyone has known for decades that these models (Black Scholes / Gaussian Copula) are wildly inaccurate in the tails. where the real risks live. They are roughly accurate on quiet days. Mandelbrot has been publishing on this since the 1960s! Anyone who pretends to believe these models is running a scam of some kind.<p>It is true that the GC played a minor role in the recent crisis but Black Scholes did not. See below for details.<p>The factors in the 2007-2012 crisis:<p>1. Fraudulent lending practices and falsified loan applications.<p>2. Excessive borrowings by households fueled by the Fed keeping interest rates too low for too long.<p>3. Belief that present trends would continue forever and house prices would continue to the moon.<p>4. Greed blinded people to the risks they were taking.<p>5. Lax to nonexistent regulation which allowed banks and related organizations to leverage to insane levels. It also allowed companies like AIG to sell insurance that they could not pay off on.<p>6. Risks were ignored due to perceived government guarantees (Fannie Mae and her ilk).<p>7. Fraudulently selling subprime toxic garbage as AAA securities. This is where the Gaussian Copula came in. Given known wrong and bogus assumptions (eg that house prices would never fall across the whole USA), it allowed the investment banks to pretend that the top tiers of the subprime securities were AAA ie secure. Internal emails showed they knew they were not really AAA. However the GC was only the vehicle; the underlying problem was fraudulent and criminal intent.<p>8. Rating agencies were paid large sums of money to rate the toxic waste as AAA. They either knew or did not care that the securities were toxic waste as long as they got the cash.<p>9. Pension funds and other naive investors believed that the rating agencies and investment banks were not lying when they said the AAA-rated securities were OK.<p>10. More recently we have seen the crisis in Europe which is the result of the failure to rein in housing bubbles caused by too-loose credit, and by governments which borrowed more than they could afford to pay back, and which made commitments that they could never fulfill (eg excessive pensions).<p>BS played a role in the near meltdown in 1998 when LTCM went down, and also in the 1987 stock market crash.<p>In both cases idiots pushed the models outside their sphere of validity. LTCM was leveraged to the hilt and assumed that short term historical correlations would continue to prevail. A cursory examination of history would show this is not the case.<p>In 1987 a technique called ""portfolio insurance"" was invented which supposedly allowed the user to simulate a protective ""put option"" at no cost. Portfolio insurance required selling stocks when the market fell. The BS model assumes infinite liquidity and no price jumps and if these are true PI should work. Again these are not valid assumptions and when the technique was implemented on the overvalued October 1987 market it accelerated and intensified the crash.<p>Even in physics most models are inaccurate outside a certain range of validity. It requires a degree of honesty and intellectual integrity to refrain from using them when they are not valid. Eg you cannot use Newtonian mechanics at 99.999% of the speed of light.<p>TL;DR this was not a mathematical mistake - it was fraud.",1335676584

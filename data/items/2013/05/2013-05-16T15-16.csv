I can see text messages, and I can see the phone number of the person calling me (not their name yet, though). I can control the music playing on my phone. That's about it right now. I haven't tried Runkeeper yet.<p>I've heard that Android users can hook in to a lot more. Hopefully iOS opens up more access for other apps to send notifications to it.<p>The feature I probably use the most is the watch itself - I don't have to pull my phone out of my pocket to check the time, and flicking my wrist to activate the backlight works really well.",1368719958

But, I throw right-handed and swing right-handed (although I became a decent switch hitter in little league, I had more power left-handed but more accuracy right-handed). Some tasks I have trouble picking a hand and go back and forth between the two. When I bowl (which is usually only about every 5 years or so) I spend the entire time switching between both hands to find one that feels more comfortable. I also pass a tennis racket from hand to hand depending on which side the ball is on, but I play ping-pong solely with my left hand. When I first started using computers in elementary school I made a conscious effort to use the mouse with my right hand because even then I knew that every computer I came to would have the mouse on the right side. However, I usually use a laptop trackpad with my left hand. I, like you, found wrist watches uncomfortable to use. I wore one in high school and always put it on my left wrist but I had to remove it every time I sat down to write or type. I think smart watches could have some useful applications, especially when cycling as a glance-able cycle-computer paired with a ride tracking app, but I just don't think I could put up with the pain of wearing a watch every day to get any benefit from one.",1368719372

That usually means he or she not only needs to be a ""10x"" hustler, but also requires coming with the resources to get started on real work already in hand.<p>That's something we struggle with, as technical people. We want to believe that ""what makes a good CEO"" is meritocratic, but it's largely about contacts. Can this guy get us to full salary on an idea alone, so we can build something? Same for college presidents; they aren't hired for the work they can do, but for the contacts they can bring in to the university.<p>See, part of being a CEO is bridging the gap between the meritocracy we wish to create (because we won't be able to compete if people are already playing political games at <10 people) and the connections-based non-meritocracy of Bullshitland outside. Freedom (or meritocracy, in our case) turns out not to be free, and the CEO's job is to make it happen because most talented people come from the working and middle classes (this isn't a dig against higher classes; it's just that the lower classes are much larger) and have zero in the way of such resources.<p>That requires an extremely rare combination:<p>1. Comes with the resources (i.e. funding, contacts) already in hand.<p>2. Not arrogant about it.

Why do they volunteer for less attractive projects? Because they actually care, because the company is (imagine this) worth caring about. Once the maintenance work is done by volunteers rather than extortion victims, it starts getting a lot of respect and people to do it to be ""heroes"". So yes, it still gets done.<p>On the other hand, if you work in a careerist closed-allocation hellhole where your boss has unilateral authority to whip it out and flow a shot on your performance reviews/""calibration score"" (i.e. managerial extortion) then, obviously people are going to look out only for themselves and the maintenance won't get done unless someone's forced to do it (in which case, it's done very badly). People will not freely participate in a closed allocation company's upkeep because the work culture of a closed-allocation firm is not worth caring about or protecting.<p>They're both equilibrium states. In one (open allocation) people see themselves as citizens and do the full mix of the work: the important and fun stuff, but also the less-fun but critical ""hero"" work. In the other (closed allocation/extortion economy) people realize that the company has no consideration for them and that no one's looking out for their careers, so they take anything that's not nailed down and the critical upkeep work doesn't get done.",1368718044

I mean ones that can be taken seriously.<p>Why do you need a deployment tool <i>written in PHP</i> for PHP applications? Are you serious? It's a ridiculous proposition to care that much about the language the deployment system is written in. What <i>I</i> care about is what benefits it brings me.<p>Where I am now we have our own deployment system, btw. - we operate a private multi-tenant cloud specifically tuned to the type of workloads our customers have, at a cost ~1/3 of what it'd cost us to host our current infrastructure somewhere like EC2 with equivalent redundancy and performance. That is <i>including</i> the development and maintenance costs for our in-house tools. As part of that we have a rapidly improving set of deployment tools. Handling deployment of PHP was pretty much the simplest part of that system.<p>> What optimization options do you have for PHP? What latitude do you have with hosting?<p>Are you for real? I <i>love</i> Ruby. I'm working on a Ruby compiler as a hobby. But scaling PHP is <i>trivial</i> compared to RoR. I <i>don't</i> need optimization options for PHP - one of our clients processes restaurant bookings worth 50 million pounds a year via a setup that consumes ~30% of CPU resources on two frontend servers with a combined leasing cost of ~1000 GBP/year. The vast majority of their cost (their total yearly cost for their internet presence is about 3 orders of magnitude above the cost of the servers hosting the PHP code) for this system is marketing, support, power and bandwidth in that order. Cost of the frontends that PHP run on comes at the very bottom - it's a rounding error. If we needed more frontend capacity? We'd add another couple servers like that, and it's still be <1% of their cost.<p>What costs us money on the hardware side is database servers and network infrastructure. Web frontends for typical simple web apps are cheap. Sure, there are exceptions (but as much as I love Ruby, RoR is certainly not going to save you scalability grief in the cases where scaling PHP becomes hard or costly).<p>> If you're not Facebook, writing your own PHP engine, you're going to be stuck with one of a few that are generally crappy.<p>If you're not Facebook, there's no compelling <i>reason</i> to write your PHP engine as PHP is fast enough for pretty much anything you throw at it until you're in a situation where you have thousands of servers, where shaving a few percent off here and there starts creating large savings.<p>A vanishingly small number of companies ever reach that scale - optimising for that in advance is lunacy, and most ""cleaner"" languages does not provide a better starting point in that respect. Ruby, for example, is far more costly to scale.<p>> Cost and developer time are non-factors since the time you'd need to learn PHP is probably higher than other languages that make more sense and aren't filled with anachronisms you will spend half your time working around.<p>Spoken as someone who doesn't know the market. I have a steady supply of qualified PHP staff. In fact, we have recruiters hounding us <i>every day</i> with cheap candidates that know PHP. Ruby? Rarely, if ever. Those who know Ruby well enough have an easy time finding better paid jobs.<p>> You can train someone up in Ruby on Rails in two weeks<p>Bullshit. You can get a senior developers that is already <i>expensive</i> to relative beginner level in that amount of time. Or you can hire a PHP developer that is already skilled at ~60% of the cost.<p>I've seen ""RoR developers"" with two weeks experience, and what they produce is not pretty, and certainly does not result in a good ROI compared to more pragmatic solutions. I'm all for using Ruby if/when you have a good team of Ruby developers, but you then also need to realize that you have an <i>expensive</i> team. It makes sense when your team is highly experienced and rapid turnaround is more important than keeping the cost down, or if your personal satisfaction is more important to you than the cost - both can be perfectly valid reasons. If I were to start a new company now, I'd pick Ruby myself. But I would do it because it is what I would prefer to work with, not out of any illusion it's currently a cheap choice.",1368718016

5718968,comment,5715168,5717705,4,0,saurik,,,"> Netscape were far from perfect and did (try to) abuse their position a bit, but if my memory is accurate (which it often isn't that far back, so have salt pinches at the ready) most of what they did wrong was due to bad business, process, and design decisions and being unwilling to backtrack on technical decisions that didn't work out so well (for reasons of compatibility: they too kept maintaining/reimplementing their old bugs so as to not alienate people with code relying on them) rather then concentrated deliberate malice.<p>My personal belief is that the extent to which this is true for Netscape it is also true for Microsoft. (To be clear, I can also make these same kinds of arguments for Google: I state this explicitly as I really am not trying to paint Microsoft as ""good"" and Google as ""bad""; however, I might come off as that while attempting to equate them, due to the preconceived notions that some people may have while reading the below ""apologies"".)<p>* They cared extensively about things like backwards compatibility, causing them to not like to change things once they built them; but they cared about being pioneers, so they often implemented things (such as CSS and XSL/T) when they were in their infancy, and got semi-locked in to details that weren't quite right (the box model was not some IE abomination: that's how the CSS box model was originally defined and it shifted underneath them).<p>* A lot of the things we didn't like about IE6 weren't actually intrinsic to IE6: it was because Microsoft stopped working on IE6 and it stagnated. Some people attribute this to them having ""won"", but that frankly makes a lot less sense than ""they had their ass handed to them with tons of sanctions and other limitations, after a massive multi-year legal--not technical--battle with Netscape, that made working on browsers risky and emotionally challenging"".<p>* They took on Sun and lost with Visual J++, which hobbled them for a while in their push to switch to using high-level language development, and led them to build the massive .NET ecosystem that is much less compatible with anyone else. (The only thing Microsoft did in J++ was add backwards compatibility for COM objects and build a Win32 GUI binding: otherwise, we would likely have ended up in a future where everything else was built on Java.)<p>This, by the way, I find to be a really interesting parallel; Sun was often on the sidelines, but has actually been a major player in all of these stories: they were already in bed with Netscape when they licensed the term ""Java"" to be used with ""JavaScript"", and then that furthered into the ""Alliance"" after AOL purchased Netscape; they then went on to pull legal challenges on the corruption of Java by first Microsoft (against whom they won, with the audience cheering them on) and now recently Google (against whom they lost, to the audiences' equal delight). The fact that so many people were willing to back Google screwing with Java while being willing to trounce Microsoft for it confuses me to no end: it seems to just come down to emotional bias.<p>> Do you have any links furthering your explanation about Netscape? Typically the story is told much, much differently, and your allegations pique my interest here very much.<p>Yes, actually: I have tons. I did a bunch of research for another comment I was going to leave to someone else a few months ago, and then decided ""engh, not important, maybe will write an article about it some day""; here is that comment:<p><< begin content I was working on a few months ago >><p>So, I was also a web developer back in the late 90's: we used to go around to area businesses trying to explain to them what the Internet was (as they would, of course, never have heard of it), and ended up working on the first websites for such companies as our local bank, newspaper, and real-estate agency. I was doing this as early as 1996.<p>You know what? I have pretty clear memories of Netscape doing exactly these things everyone always gets angry at Microsoft over. Netscape, a company that sold a commercial web browser, was embarking on an embrace-and-extend campaign against HTML itself, and using the resulting influence to get bundled from ISPs as a default part of the Internet experience.<p>At the time, Internet Explorer existed, but was a joke: no one used it. Instead, sources reported that 70% of the people browsing the Internet were running Netscape Navigator.<p>> Netscape Navigator 2.0 is a standard on the Web; according to some surveys, it is used by 70 percent of all Web surfers.<p>-- Web Based Programming Tutorials <a href=""http://www.webbasedprogramming.com/Special-Edition-Using-Java-Script/ch18.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webbasedprogramming.com/Special-Edition-Using-Jav...</a><p>What this meant is that when Netscape released new features that were specific to their browser, a lot of developers didn't think twice about using them.<p>> Even though unauthorized, the Netscape extensions have become commonly excepted tags and are used in many Web documents. <CENTER>...</CENTER> The Center tags is one of the most popular Netscape extensions (see the HTML Center Tag below).<p>-- An Educator's Introduction to HTML <a href=""http://literacy.kent.edu/Midwest/HTML/netscape.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://literacy.kent.edu/Midwest/HTML/netscape.htm</a><p>Yes: even CENTER was a Netscape-specific extension. In fact, many of the tags that have long been considered ""deprecated"" and which many web designers consider cringe-worthy due to being ""presentation-only"", were added by Netscape and only adopted into the specifications because their usage was already too widespread. Netscape was considered fun to ""bash"" on the W3C mailing lists.<p>> Netscape seems to have conveniently ignored certain HTML tags which they don't want to use. They talk all sweet and innocent ""Netscape remains committed to supporting HTML 3.0"" But we all know that that's bullshit.<p>-- Dan Delaney <a href=""http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-html/1996Mar/0175.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-html/1996Mar/0175.ht...</a><p>> Netscape is young and horny.

If you go back to books published at the time about HTML development, this was a well-known tradeoff: Netscape-specific extensions were designed to have you to embed styling information directly into the HTML.<p>> Many of Netscape's HTML extensions differ from the proposed HTML 3.0 standard in one big, important way. Netscape has implemented many page formatting options as custom HTML tags; HTML 3.0 proposes to handle formatting via a technique called style sheets.<p>-- Special Edition Using HTML, 2nd Edition <a href=""http://www.fishmech.net/netscape/docs/sehtml/15.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fishmech.net/netscape/docs/sehtml/15.htm</a><p>Microsoft, in comparison, was actually looking pretty good. The developers were on the mailing list, and were even submitting the DTD's that they were using for validation of HTML for public comment before they released new versions. The people on the mailing list at the time really appreciated this, and made their opinions known publicly.<p>> Excellent! It's really encouraging to see a vendor supplying a DTD for a change.<p>-- Gerald Oskoboiny <a href=""http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-html/1996Mar/0139.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-html/1996Mar/0139.ht...</a><p>> Excellent!

After checking the Microsoft homepage, I see that they claim to be supporting W3C tables, but even then they are adding new attributes.  Still, at least they say they'll support style sheets, and that they've concluded the agreement to add Java.<p>-- Charles Peyton Taylor <a href=""http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-html/1996Mar/0197.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-html/1996Mar/0197.ht...</a><p>In fact, when we look back at Microsoft's Internet Explorer, the main things we hate are actually not places where they failed to adopt standards or built their own tools: it is when they adopted a standard very early, and then the standard changed out from underneath them. Stylesheets are a great example of this: the ""IE box model"" was in the standard when MS released.<p>You then mention ActiveX, but Netscape was pulling the same stunts with Java: their proprietary LiveScript features (which later became JavaScript) were designed to allow seamless back/forth communication with the Java VM (also not an open standard, to note). I remember working on websites at the time, and you'd find import statements in JavaScript code referencing out to Java classes.<p>When you then found Microsoft building JScript, a language compatible with the base JavaScript specification, that was tightly integrated to an alternative non-open system called ActiveX, it really wasn't surprising, nor was it in any way different from Netscape: both companies now had browsers that had a language compatible with a base (Netscape-defined, btw) specification that had deep integration with an external full programming environment.<p>Netscape had also added a feature allowing for Netscape-specific plugins which was becoming more and more popular. I remember there being more than a small handful of plugins that people reasonably expected you to have, to do everything from audio to animation.<p><< I had not finished past this point, and hadn't finished sourcing the statements regarding LiveScript. I will probably write a longer fully-sourced article at some point soon, now that my time has been freed up from evasi0n's wave being largely over and Android Substrate finally being released. >>",1368716747

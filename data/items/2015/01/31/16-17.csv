You wanted a Unix environment, so surely you&#x27;ve investigated the market for compatibility with Linux, when you purchased your hardware.<p>Second, I&#x27;ve been running arch linux with standard packages on several random laptops and desktops and never had any problem whatsover. It&#x27;s been my main OS for years. Actually my only OS.<p>Third, a certain program crashes/ has a bug on your hardware? Then switch that program with something else. If what you care about is a Unix environment for programming, and Gnome is having some problem with your hardware, than switch to Xfce, or Xmonad, or i3 ... That the rational thing to do.<p>If you still want that particular program that&#x27;s having problems with your hardware, because, maybe you really like the UI, then by all means fix that bug. It shouldn&#x27;t take you more than a few minutes, at most a couple of hours in 90% of the times.

8977147,comment,8976872,8977096,0,0,sillysaurus3,,,"<i>And God forbid you make anything that might actually be easy for non-programmers to learn. It will be more or less met with instant and persistent scorn, and its users derided and outcast, simply because they didn&#x27;t use a &#x27;Real Programming Language&#x27; like C.</i><p>Prejudice doesn&#x27;t seem to have anything to do with it.  Functional programmers think differently, and what&#x27;s obvious to the Functionals isn&#x27;t to the Statefuls.  And the Statefuls are currently most of the world.  I&#x27;ve flip-flopped myself, because while I love the elegance of being a Fucntional, being a Stateful is just so much more productive.  There are a few reasons for this: If I want to make a game, there&#x27;s no good functional framework.  If I want to write a script to get something done, like download a webpage, my goto language is Python because I know for a fact that their libraries work and that their documentation is almost always stellar.  Contrast that with Lisp where you can spend at least a day just getting the environment set up in a way that asdf doesn&#x27;t hate.  Especially on Windows.  (Yes, if you want to make games, Windows needs to support your dev environment.)  My info about asdf is a couple years out of date, because to be honest I haven&#x27;t felt inclined to look into it again after some bad experiences.<p>Haskell could be wonderful.  Never tried it.  Will someday.  Until then, I&#x27;d love some sort of competition where a Haskell programmer and myself are given a task, like &quot;write a script to X,&quot; where X is some real-world relevant task and not an academic puzzle, and see who finishes it first.  It would be illuminating, since I&#x27;d give myself about a 30% chance of finishing first, but it would reveal what I&#x27;m lacking.<p>Arc had potential.  It really did.  Everyone just gave up on it, and it never attracted the kind of heroic programmers that Clojure did.<p>So the wildcard seems to be Clojure.  It&#x27;s a decent mix of performant, practical, and documented.<p>I&#x27;m out of time to pursue this comment further, but the main point is just that FP&#x27;s problems have very little to do with societal acceptance or scorn.  If you&#x27;re running into that, you&#x27;re probably running with a bad crowd anyway.  It&#x27;s mostly because imperative languages are popular, so network effects mean they&#x27;ll just get better and better.  If FP wants to chip away at that, it&#x27;ll need to start off better and stay better.  &quot;Better&quot; is many things, but it includes performance, cross-platformability (yes, Windows is necessary), documentation, and practicality (the ability to quickly accomplish random tasks without a huge prior time investment, Python seems to be the best at this so far).",1422723187

The survival rate for measles is actually quite high.  Schools are responding appropriately.  People who know they&#x27;re at risk are responding appropriately.

The effects are scary, and not proven uncorrelated to the vaccine itself.  Antivax communities are more comfortable exposing their families to risk of measles than risk of the vaccine injury, despite the risk being much, much lower.  This is irrational, but also understandable human behavior, since the prognosis is perceived to be worse in a vaccine injury case than in a measles case.<p>The recordkeeping of vaccine injuries are also horrible, so trying to make any rational, numbers-based argument is impossible.<p>Ultimately, the spread of vax-injury videos is no different than the spread of the Eric Garner video on facebook.  That&#x27;s something we never would have heard about 10 years ago, and would never have caused such a national uproar.  People are acting irrationally despite the very low chance of being affected.<p>Bottom line - if you want to stop anti-vaxers, you need better prevention (pretty much elimination) of vaccine injuries.  The anecdotal evidence against vaccines can&#x27;t be on Youtube or people will continue to avoid them.  Science is working on it, but we&#x27;re not there yet.

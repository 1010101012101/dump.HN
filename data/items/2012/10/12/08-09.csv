Then he changes it to 1/7 sentences per line, i.e. he moves <i>away</i> from his supposed ""one sentence per line"" target. Yes, in the text of the article he admits that maybe he was thinking about clauses, but I have a zero tolerance policy towards objectively wrong titles.<p>And of course, the real solution to the problem of ""fussing with the lines of each paragraph so that they all end near the right margin"" is to use a text editor that soft-wraps lines. Yes, computers have recently become powerful enough to make that possible while editing the document! Amazing.",1350032273

While LearnStreet is an amazing tool, and another great way to be introduced to programming, the site immediately feels very similar to Codecademy. A responsive console is very cool, but I don't think it is the best way to connect with absolute beginners.<p>Our philosophy is that the key to teaching beginners is on providing help from real people, and that is what we are doing at CodeHS.

4644270,comment,4643353,4643353,1,0,fingerprinter,,,"Two thoughts<p>1. I worked for a cruise booking company (a deplorable company and industry, just FYI, but that is a story for another day). I wrote their systems for integrating with Sabre and then the UI. The industry just plain sucks. The scams, the ""discounts"", the different prices. Not to mention that getting the data is a nightmare (it might have changed, I've been out of that for some time now). I honestly felt terrible about what I did nearly everyday. There was always ""another tweak"" to get more money out of the customer, some additional fee or service charge. It was unbelievable.<p>I don't know kangacruise and I wish them luck. I hope they can wade through the crap industry and make a nice experience that gets the user a fair price.<p>2. In the past 5 years I've taken at least 3 vacations a year plus at least 10-15 business trips. Conservatively, say 35 trips, many of them international. Not once did I consult a travel agent. I considered it once for a more involved trip, but when I saw that they weren't really bringing much to the table, I left and did it all myself. It wasn't hard. Perhaps having to loop in three different sites is annoying, but unless there was an overly compelling reason to use a travel agent, I wouldn't even consider it.<p>At this point in time, I feel travel agents are mostly for older folks or someone with more money than sense. I don't know if you can actually create a market (yes, I feel you would have to create it...it wouldn't form naturally) which is always an uphill battle.",1350032001

He appeared from his Usenet posts to be in some kind of emotional pain. Without a natural leader, the community fragmented. One group made a ""patchkit"" to collect fixes to the official distribution. Another group cut ties, making their own distribution (NetBSD). Eventually the patchkit group also got fed up with Bill Jolitz lack of cooperation, and released the patchkit version as FreeBSD.<p>Meanwhile, the Linux people seemed to have fun. Linux was even more buggy and far less featureful, but was improving fast from the collective effort of the community. Sometimes they made (for an old Unix person) atrocities like ""color-ls"". And their willingness to diverge from old Unix paradigms did make their software more convenient. color-ls is actually kind of useful.<p>The Linux developers seemed to consist of college kids being enthusiastic about a hobby they all loved. The BSD developers seemed to be hard working software professionals, making great personal sacrifices for a BSD cause. The first group was simply more fun to be around, so the community grew faster, especially among college students.<p>When the college students graduated, they took Linux with them to their new jobs.<p>...<p>Come to think of it, it actually mirrors the early BSD vs SysV UNIX cultural divide.

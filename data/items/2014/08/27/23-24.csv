They stand in one place in space, in front of the door, while naturally moving forward in the fourth dimension (time) to arrive to a slice of space-time in which the door isn&#x27;t there. In this range of space-time they traverse space by a small distance (a meter or two), and also slip forward in time by a several seconds (which is not long enough to leave this special range of space-time). By so doing, they reach a point in space on the other side of where the door was. Then they slip forward in time again, to a time when the door is there again, at which time they smugly find themselves on the other side of the door.",1409183963

There&#x27;s a lot of data to train on since all historical loan data is available.<p>The exact model to use is tricky though. You could train a classifier to detect whether a loan will default or not, but this doesn&#x27;t weigh the chance of default with the interest rate. I then thought of doing a regression on the expected return, which would properly balance between interest rate and default rate. At some point, though, you need to make the binary decision of whether to invest in the loan or not, again classification.<p>Another complication is that since LendingClub has been growing exponentially, the majority of the loans they&#x27;ve issued haven&#x27;t matured yet. Utilizing this partially complete data is even more tricky. You could ignore non-mature loans, but that would reduce your training data significantly and make your data at least 3 years old.",1409183717

It didn&#x27;t seem right to reject donations just because the goal wasn&#x27;t met. If a fundraiser can raise any amount, then it makes their future debt much more manageable.<p>We&#x27;ve been tossing around the idea of removing the deadline, but because of the gap of time between acceptance and your first tuition payment, we inserted a deadline to focus donations in our limited timeframe. In the future, we can encourage applicants to create campaigns as quickly as possible, in order to maximize the amount of time before the first tuition payment. In theory, fundraisers can continue their campaigns until their full tuition is covered, where a portion of the total is sent directly to the school in order to cover that particular payment period. At the very least, it will buy fundraisers more time to cover the total cost of their needs.",1409183618
8235282,comment,8233954,8234530,1,0,sirmarksalot,,,"I think part of what made Hypercard so useful was that it made it really easy to make one specific kind of application, which at the time was 90% of what any single person could be expected to do by themselves. Most of the &quot;multimedia experiences&quot; people were making and buying were basically interactive slideshows, roughly as complex as a DVD menu. Hypercard made this easy, and you knew before you started whether or not it would be a good fit for your project. Under the covers, it was a Turning-complete language, but I&#x27;d imagine trying to make anything more complicated than Myst would be really painful. I suspect the developers of Myst probably ran into its limitations before they were done.<p>I think the main obstacle nowadays is deployment. Back in the day, you&#x27;d have Hypercard export a native application, and then copy it onto a disk that you passed around. Nowadays, the expectation is that people can run it in a browser, or download it from an app store. Web-based deployment means you have to embed it in a website using Javascript, while app stores require setting up a developer account, and building with complicated toolchains.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say it definitively can&#x27;t be done, just an explanation of why it hasn&#x27;t yet.",1409183572

8235279,comment,8233954,8234875,3,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"> he claims simplicity led him to reject higher-order functions for the &quot;simple&quot; language he is designing. But higher-order functions are a tool useful to reduce the complexity of code! It just happens that a programmer unused to them must first learn about them before becoming proficient with them.<p>Higher-order functions, or higher-order anything (e.g. predicates) are not complicated because they are unfamiliar, but are complicated necessarily: HOFs, for example, indirect control and data flow, and now you have to think 2nd or 3rd order (hopefully not more) about what your code is doing!<p>Complexity is really just in the definition of &quot;higher-order.&quot; It even shows up directly in our tools for automatically reasoning about program behavior (1st order is easier to deal with than 2nd or N-order). There is a reason 1st order logic is so popular, not because people don&#x27;t get higher-order logic, but 1st order logic is easier to deal with. The problem is, of course, expressiveness (you can&#x27;t do much with a functional language that doesn&#x27;t admit HOFs).",1409183515

I would kind of accept strange things to happen when an uninitialized bool (which is really an int) is not exactly 1 or 0.<p>Perhaps a better way to deal with the memcpy issue is this: make memcpy() safe (handles 0 size, allows overlapping regions), but create a fast_memcpy() for speed.",1409183381

The first and foremost important feature of a 3d printer is the quality of the prints. That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s made for. It&#x27;s not made to connect via WiFi, tweet when the print is done, change LED colors while printing and make coffee. It can do that, sure, but that&#x27;s not its primary purpose, now is it? When I look at some of the currently offered printers it&#x27;s like someone trying to sell me a car, with all the bells and whistles, for a crazy low price, and it&#x27;s not that ugly actually... but sadly the only thing it doesn&#x27;t do is drive.<p>That entire paragraph is subjective.

These are toy models - a little like saying &quot;But what if I had a box that could solve the halting problem&quot; in computer science - and, to put it mildly, they are not regarded as promising candidates for physical theories.

Their approach to implement a turing-complete scripting system into their blockchain which miner&#x27;s must be able to execute is definitely interesting. But it&#x27;s also very complicated. I&#x27;ll be interested to see if they can successfully implement it.<p>In my opinion, a much more viable approach to ASIC-resistance - which is already implemented and live today - is proof-of-capacity hard-drive based mining. This is an approach to mining which Microsoft proposed in a research paper last year [1]. It&#x27;s recently been implemented by an altcoin called Burstcoin [2].<p>I should disclose that I&#x27;ve been mining BURST, and therefore am financially interested in seeing it succeed. However I also genuinely believe it is interesting technology, and I&#x27;d like to see some sort of proof-of-capacity mining succeed purely because of the technical merits.<p>The proof-of-capacity mining process basically works by pre-generating as many &quot;plots&quot; as possible to your hard-drive. Every plot is like a lottery ticket for a lottery that takes place once per block. If you have the luckiest plot for a block, then you get to claim the next block. After initial plot generation, the mining process is very energy efficient since it only requires a small amount of hard-drive reads per block. It&#x27;s also ASIC-resistant and likely to remain very decentralized because the of the wide distribution of hard-drive storage capacity.<p>[1] <a href=""https://research.microsoft.com/pubs/217984/permacoin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://research.microsoft.com/pubs/217984/permacoin.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=731923.0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=731923.0</a>",1409181207

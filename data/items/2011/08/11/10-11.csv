(Note, however, that one can say that generally about most laws and regulations.  Indeed, the FDA ""is killing job creation,"" by making it so hard to sell potentially unsafe drugs and medical devices.)  The real question is:  ""does the current system of patent law 'kill' more or less jobs than a reformed system where software patents are unallowable?""<p>Small-to-medium-sized businesses may flourish, adding some jobs in the process, but could a larger tech company have created more jobs based on software patents it is able to sometimes obtain via the patent office (or otherwise license legitimately or by settlement)?",1313057645

I'm exactly like you, started with PHP, had to do everything manually, etc... except I have a different opinion.<p>The reason you and I and all the others like us put in so much effort in solving problems in PHP like CSRF, XSS and SQLI was because we were passionate enough to learn about that and then implement solutions for it.<p>Developers who don't care about security measures like that - they're the ones who store plaintext passwords, still - won't care either way, no matter if they're using Rails or PHP. Frameworks like Rails solves it for them, but if it weren't for Rails, their apps would have all these security problems, and they would only be addressed once disaster strikes.<p>Those that do care will be passionate about their work. They are the ones that read up on XSS and CSRF out of interest, not necessity. I'm sure they look at the generated HTML source once in a while, and then wonder why they add that token there. Using Rails, newbies are exposed to the solutions from the start, encouraging them to learn about it. As a PHP newbie, you're never exposed to the problem or the solution, until you start reading about security on your own or you get into trouble.",1313057409

You cannot write a useful C program without using the standard library or re-implementing (parts of) its functionality yourself. If for some reason having functions available that you don't use bothers you, you can still easily disable most of them by not loading any extensions; and if it's really a big issue to have the 'standard' functions in php available, you can compile php to not include them.

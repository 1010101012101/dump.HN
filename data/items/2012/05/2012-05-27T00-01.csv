Sometimes confusing.<p>* value types limit certain conversions. eg. you can't convert an []int to an []interface{} directly because an int and an interface{} are different sizes in memory.(<a href=""http://golang.org/doc/go_faq.html#convert_slice_of_interface"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/doc/go_faq.html#convert_slice_of_interface</a>)<p>* Error handling can become quite verbose if you don't design your code to limit the places errors can come from.<p>* gofmt is awesome, but in some rare situations the default format makes code less clear, so you have to change your style of code to fit the formatting.<p>* 'go get' is awesome, but it's lack of centralisation makes it harder to find the good 3rd party libraries amongst the bad/incomplete ones.<p>* The current goroutine scheduler is really simple and moves goroutines between threads and CPUs.

That's because they have to factor in that with such a high payout, there is a risk of destroying their business altogether.  You can't capitalise on the positive expected value over 1000 years if you went bankrupt in year 3, even if that was just due to ""bad luck"".<p>This is just like the understanding that poker players have, that you need a considerably larger bankroll than the stakes you are playing in order to ride out ""variance"", as it's known.<p>Insurance companies understand risk.",1338077363

In specific, it must be prohibitively expensive to determine whether each and every asserted claim in each and every patent asserted against an ""infringer"" is valid.  This determination can only be done via patent litigation.<p>What happens if this precondition does not exist?<p>The patent trolling business will fail.<p>This is because everyone knows most, maybe even all, of the claims in the patent portfolios the patent troll has amassed are not valid.  They are potentially worthless.  Companies simply do not know which ones are valid and which ones are not.  And it's too expensive to find out.  So companies are willing to negotiate instead of engaging in patent litigation.<p>If we were to make patent litigation so inexpensive that anyone could afford to ""call the patent troll's bluff"", these ridiculous patents would never be filed for much less asserted.  In other words, if we could have an inexpensive determination of what claims are valid and which ones are not valid, we could separate the wheat from the chaff.  And these enormous patent portfolios would shrink down to size.  Just the wheat.  If there is any.  It would be difficult to make hollow threats and engage in IV-style extortion.<p>It is only the expense of finding out whether a claim is valid (through litigation) that makes patent trolling a viable business.<p>Maybe patent lawyers managed to get the best of Myrvold while he was a CTO, and he believes by opening the gates for a vibrant patent trolling industry, he will make life easier for every technology company in the future.  All they have to do is pay some protection money and their worries will be gone.",1338077244

Because patents are wrong to start with and the conditions of the software industry (fast-moving, high volume of research/invention) magnify the problem? Because the patent office isn't sufficiently equipped to grant reasonable patents on software (judging 'obviousness' etc.)? Because all these HNers have personal experience of being constrained by patent issues? Because coming up with ideas for new software methodologies/techniques is not comparable with the R&D of other industries?<p><i>It's not the concept of patents, it's not that large companies are using them, it's not that people are enforcing them, it's not any of that nonsense...I think you had a grasp on this concept earlier, but lost sight of it when you tried to analyse it too closely.</i><p>This sounds a bit supercilious.",1338077102

Here's the thing, for those of us who use PHP on a daily basis, we are all well aware of all of this.<p>I have almost 100K lines of PHP code and only one of them spits out HTML. That would be the line that fetches the initial HTML template which is static and spits it out. After that, everything is XHR and web sockets. The DOM is manipulated directly by client-side JavaScript.<p>Why use PHP? Libraries to use any database I can imagine. Existing libraries for any API I can imagine. Language maturity. Familiarity and similarity to C.<p>I know the mines and I stay away. On top of that, those maintaining the language are aware of them too and they are slowly deprecating them.<p>> PHP is a supposedly dynamic language, but it almost goes out of its way to make manipulating complex data structures difficult.<p>Why would you use complex data structures in PHP? If you did, why try to manipulate them?<p>PHP is a language that is made for the web. On the web, anything that is computation heavy, like data manipulation, should be done on the client's side. Not that JavaScript is much better at data structures and manipulation, but at least it probably has a monster of a CPU and a boatload of RAM to smooth things over.",1338076885

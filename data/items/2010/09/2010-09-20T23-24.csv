1710916,comment,1679125,1708056,0,0,SiVal,,,"In fact I pay very close attention to what teachers actually do in classrooms, to the extent that I've traveled to several East Asian countries to observe how they teach with my own eyes and read the academic studies contrasting their approaches. These countries stomp us every four years in the TIMSS, and I wanted to know how exactly how they did it and, if necessary, how to duplicate it in my own home.<p>The difference is stark. In Asia, they teach people math the way you would expect to teach someone if you were trying to maximize their proficiency in almost any skill: sports, chess, whatever. In the US, the education industry is pushing a very different approach, one whose primary objective is NOT maximizing the proficiency of each student.<p>But, you don't see it, and the US education industry (meaning the ed schools and their progeny, not individual teachers) would prefer that people like you go on ascribing any observation of their inferior results to ""right-wing ranting"" so you'll stay out of their way or, even better, go out of your way to try to discredit their critics.<p>Of course many teachers, even whole school districts, resist this pressure, and the ed schools describe that resistance in peer-reviewed journal articles such as the one I cited. If what I'm describing were merely the imaginings of those kooky right-wingers, like the leader of the Democratic Party in the Senate I cited above, then what is all this talk by the ed schools of ""resistance""? Resistance to what, something that would increase math proficiency? Why would math teachers be ""especially resistant"" to maximizing math proficiency, or are they resisting pressure to make changes that would reduce math proficiency?<p>If your son had been in East Asia, he would have done the half hour of drills every day BEFORE taking that test and probably would have avoided the problem he apparently had. How do you think he, or his classmates, would do now on a test for Asian 5th graders? (Ex: 1/6 of A is equal to 5/9 of B. 2/5 of A is 270 more than 1/3 of B. What is the ratio of A:B in simplest form? Source: misskoh.com)<p>My kids are learning from the materials I brought back from Asia, and I'm trying to teach using the methods I saw (though I feel so amateurish compared to those amazing Asian teachers) and the results are, well, Asian-level. These are materials and teaching methods optimized for math proficiency and nothing else. Their friends think they are geniuses, and I have to keep reminding them that in Asia, their whole class (though not each individual student) would be operating at their level.<p>If I could, I would switch the whole country to these materials and methods, but guys like you can be counted on to say, ""I don't see the problem, it's just more uninformed nonsense from someone who reads too much right-wing ranting"". With your help, our public education industry can continue unimpeded by guys like me. My own kids will face less local competition as a result, but I fear the consequences for my country as a whole will be dire, so I would change it if I could.",1285026418

Marin County was asked to leave after San Mateo County did because of doubt over whether the Golden Gate Bridge was structurally capable of carrying trains and because the county's low population density couldn't support their share of the cost.  The Geary line within San Francisco remained in the plan at that time but was dropped to cut the cost of the initial system far enough that it could be funded.<p>That said, the original express intent of BART was to relieve freeway congestion from car commuters, not to provide an urban transit system.

Like most of us on HN, he is able to work in a career he enjoys that isn't labor intensive (thus capable for older people)<p>The WorldBank says the average life expectancy in USA is 78 (<a href=""http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN?cid=GPD_10"" rel=""nofollow"">http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN?cid=GPD_1...</a>) so if you finally gave up work at 73 that's only an average of 5 years you need to live without an income - and that for most successful professional workers this is probably manageable through savings and/or reverse mortgage on a reasonable sized house.<p>The pension industry hasn't really changed in 50 years yet the way we live, work, and end our lives has changed (and continues to change rapidly).  If the shift is towards us working longer that means we need them less, so there is no reason for them to adapt.",1285023927

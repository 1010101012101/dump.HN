192355,comment,192304,192304,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I moved from Texas to the valley in winter of last year, and was stunned to find that a lot of places (a majority?) don't have AC, including the house I rented.  But, the fact is it's not too bad.  Yesterday and today were pretty toasty, but after the long winter (I'm from Texas...the bay area is cold in contrast), it's kind of a relief.<p>I have a swamp cooler in the bath tub with a fan blowing out into the rest of the house.  I'm running the vaporizer that I bought when I got a nasty sore throat and head cold a couple of months back--a cool mist drizzling over me all day is pretty sweet...actually, I think it's better than AC, but I might be weird.  And, of course, all the windows and doors are open (after about noon when the house has heated up to be warmer than outside--since it cools down a lot at night) to maximize the breeze.<p>And, as others have pointed out, there are other places to go.  Coffee shops often have AC.  Libraries always do.  Sitting under a tree in the park is probably cooler than your apartment by 10 degrees, and pretty girls (or boys, depending on your preference) might walk by once in a while.<p>Or you could buy a window unit.  I made it through last summer without too much discomfort, so I'll probably skip AC this year as well.",1210984207

Ars is different, thankfully. They have a lot less leeway in playing with Ars's format. Of course, they could throw the established format for all it's worth, but I hope they won't. AT's also a great site. Too many flash ads on the main page but thankfully adblock takes care of it.",1210984009

Financially, I can support the move by leaps and bounds because of my connections with certain people at a local ISP.

It was created foremost as a mutually beneficial arrangement between the Crown and publishers to ensure certain subjects were not published in exchange for a guaranteed monopoly on publication. In our current system, copyright is supposed to be a mutually beneficial arrangement between Society and creators to foster the useful Art in exchange for a temporary monopoly. Since the temporary nature of that monopoly has been over-stretched, effectively to the point of permanence, society (especially the digitally literate youth) has begun to disregard the compromise.",1210982952

253622,comment,253456,253614,0,0,rit,,,"I actually meant relaunching Vista with a new brand (I mean, in many cases each release of OS X - esp the last ~2 releases is essentially aservice pack - updated kernel, some UI tweaks and some extra hangon apps and it works great giving it a new name even though it's officially a minor patch level).<p>But, come to think of it - XP would work as well.  MS is currently rebranding XP as a 'portable' OS ; they're supplying it to companies making mini laptops like OLPC, Asus [eeepc] and Cloudbooks.  I think thats as far as they want to go because they're aware they're cannibalizing Vista business by leaving XP in the market.  For me, it just means when I install VMWare on my Macs and Linux boxes that that cracked copy of XP is getting a few more years of use ;)",1216759908

It might have made a big difference in my life had it happened years ago.<p><i>If you can get in and really want to go there, they will find a way for you to be able to attend.</i><p>Yes, and this was true back in my day as well. They make it <i>possible</i> to attend... by going into debt. The amount of debt that is considered <i>possible</i> is, however, constrained by the supply of credit and by the amount of debt that society considers ""reasonable"". That's a much larger number today than it used to be.<p>My point is that societal factors like credit policy, accounting practices, banking regulations, and the popular acceptance of the debtor lifestyle <i>change your environment</i> in ways that are difficult to ignore and resist, even for those of us who are informed enough to try to avoid debt.",1216757765

I don't remember the quote exactly, but i think it's something like ""...when all you know are hammers, everything looks like a nail..."".  Though I think his point is that you have to at least be able to form models about the problems you tackle and stick to those models.  I feel like you need some commitment or vision to be able to move on.  Development tends to have two phases, exploration and exploitation.  Balancing the two is a real problem.  If you exploit too soon you may miss a much better solution, but if you do too much exploring you may just be wasting time.  Balancing the two contributes to writing good code it seems.",1216757398

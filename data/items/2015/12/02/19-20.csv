And I feel that I kinda hold this project to higher standards: If I compare this to WhatsApp/Telegram/Threema/Whatever, I inheritently, somewhat subconciously expect more from Signal.<p>And I&#x27;m disappointed. I tend to repeat the &#x27;central server&#x27; and &#x27;a phone number is not an address and not public information, it certainly is no identity&#x27; criticism.<p>When I read the headline/title, I thought &#x27;Now maybe that would be enough to be ~good enough~ to ditch Telegram&#x27; in spite of these problems (which Telegram has as well, ofc). But really. A Chrome app. And works only (yeah, I think I said it before: Phone numbers suck) as a secondary client. And only if the first client is Android?<p>I seriously don&#x27;t get it. And it certainly is not for me: I don&#x27;t like that browser (I do have it installed for testing and to follow it at times, but there&#x27;s no &#x27;app&#x27; I&#x27;d run in Chrome). I don&#x27;t want to tie something to my phone and I don&#x27;t think that it should matter what platform my handset runs on - SailfishOS looks nice, FxOS progresses slow but ticks a good number of boxes for me.<p>Full circle to the first line: I don&#x27;t _like_ to be negative and the headline gave me hope for a couple seconds.

We could get 97.5% accuracy by just predicting False all of the time.  We don&#x27;t advise reviewers to use the prediction directly, but rather to set thresholds on the probability.  70% probability is a very conservative filter and will catch about 10% and a little bit less than half of them will actually be damaging.<p>So, this is useful enough to reduce the workload by 90% right now.  As we increase the model&#x27;s fitness, we should be able to drive that up to 95%, but I doubt we&#x27;ll get much better than that.",1449086213

Without some of these affordances, a chat app has simply has no chance of gaining widespread adoption in such a competitive landscape. This is why it is very difficult to justify pouring any significant resources into building a decentralized chat app, because too few people will ever end up using it to justify the investment.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I am the author of a decentralized messaging app myself [1], and have spent <i>a lot</i> of time thinking about stuff like this, and eventually reached this unfortunate conclusion and decided to leave the project at the prototype stage.<p>[1] <a href=""http://toc.im/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://toc.im/</a>",1449086188

I&#x27;m not sure that better tanks would have made as much difference; and, furthermore, I suspect that the US was able to absorb the costs of the air war without much difficulty, so it wasn&#x27;t really siphoning resources away from things like tanks.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what to make of the Sherman tank. On the one hand, it was famously under-armored and under-gunned; on the other hand, it was fast, maneuverable, reliable, fuel efficient, cheap to produce, and perhaps easier to ship across the ocean than heavier German-style tanks would have been. So, in the final accounting, I&#x27;m not sure if it was really a bad tank or if its shortcomings were justified in the big picture.<p>I&#x27;m not any kind of WWII expert, so please fill me in on what I don&#x27;t know.",1449086068

If you&#x27;re running a startup with 3-5 people, and someone is wrong about something, chances are the stakes are much much larger than a 100 person company. As such, you can&#x27;t afford to have this kind of culture at startup scale, but you can, at large scale, because everyone gets more chances to be wrong (and have the company stay afloat). Then you start thinking about 1,000+, 10,000+, 100,000+ people companies and you can imagine how many small inefficiencies/mistakes like this companies can withstand.<p>Depending on where you work in the US, there are still managers/bosses that don&#x27;t like to be contradicted, because of some perception of loss of authority/power/credibility/etc (and most likely some personal insecurity).",1449085796

10665301,comment,10663208,10663596,0,0,halfak_wmf,,,"+1 for Egalitarianism.  So, when I use the word &quot;feminism&quot;, I&#x27;m referring to the academic field that explores power structures in social systems.  These power structures go far beyond gender issues despite what the label &quot;feminism&quot; implies.  It&#x27;s this broader sense of justice/morality in social spaces that I would like to engage with and draw inspiration from.<p>There are two core bits of feminist theory that I draw from as inspiration in organizing our work on this system:<p>* Empowerment vs. Power over -- I&#x27;m a computer scientist and I&#x27;ve been studying quality control in Wikipedia for 10 years.  That makes me very powerful in this conversation.  I could use that power to browbeat Wikipedians into changing their quality control practices to what <i>I</i> think we should do.  But on the other hand, I don&#x27;t think that my perspective is absolute.  A lot of Wikipedians know better than I do how they should curate the encyclopedia.  So instead, I&#x27;m trying to empower Wikipedians and our community of tool developers to imagine how they&#x27;d like quality control to work.  My research[1,2,3] suggests that we need reform here and I&#x27;d rather see that reform through innovation than command and control.  Honestly though, I don&#x27;t need to look to feminism for this insight.  I came to the same conclusion after considering Wikipedia as a complex social system[4].<p>* The potential for systemic biases -- As other comments have pointed out, there&#x27;s inevitably systemic bias in people&#x27;s behavior as they evaluate good and bad edits in Wikipedia because these judgements are inherently subjective and there&#x27;s a strong incentive to push back against anything that is new and unusual -- especially, things that don&#x27;t follow the western scholarly traditions of reference information.  Once encoded into a black box algorithm, these biases can become even more hidden and substantially more impactful.  One bias that is plainly obvious at the moment is against anonymous editors.  While a lot of vandalism may come from anonymous editors, so does ~25% of productive contributions to Wikipedia articles (it&#x27;s my job to measure these things).  We&#x27;re actively working to nerf the &quot;is anonymous&quot; feature and find better sources of signal.<p>1. Halfaker, A., Geiger, R. S., Morgan, J. T., & Riedl, J. (2012).

The number of topics you can absorb per unit term obviously increases with your pre-existing competency with the skill.</i><p>There absolutely <i>are</i> diminishing returns in mastering a skill. For example, if you spend a year learning how to play the piano, you might be at a level where you can play some pop songs and impress your friends. To be at the level where you can play some Rachmaninov will probably require an order of magnitude more time (10 years), even though you know all the basics. In the process of mastery from years 1-10, you won&#x27;t unlock an order of magnitude more songs that you can play as a result. In fact, each year that you march towards mastery, there&#x27;ll probably be less and less songs that you&#x27;ll be unlocking as a result. Your returns are diminishing.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that you shouldn&#x27;t seek to master something (or several things), only that if you are trying to accomplish something which requires mastery of a lot of skills (like starting a company) you should eliminate blind spots by learning a bit about what you don&#x27;t know. Even reading a book about sales is better than not knowing anything at all about it. Even if you have a sales expert on your team, it helps to empathize and know what they&#x27;ll be thinking about as you build the product (if you are an engineer).

How many web workers do you have per dyno?<p>I worked on a pretty heavy monolithic rails app that was able to run 3-4 unicorn workers per heroku 512mb dyno.<p>I&#x27;d highly suggest you use newrelic and try to analyze how much memory each worker is consuming and how that exceeds the total dyno 1GB limit. Make sure you look at the peak consumption per worker in new relic. Otherwise you might run into a problem where workers are killed after exceeding the total dyno memory limit. You want to tweak the number of unicorn workers based on their total memory consumption at peak times, and find the optimal number of workers that can fit in a 1GB heroku dyno.<p>Having said that, heroku does get expensive as you scale up. You&#x27;d be better off managing your own servers, but that requires a good chunk of time to setup properly.<p>A few things I did in order to bring the slug size down for heroku dynos was to move all assets to AWS s3/cloudfront. Minify all CSS and JS, use carrierwave gem to upload to s3 bucket, and serve with cloudfront. Getting all of your static assets out of your slug will greatly reduce memory usage.<p>Also, I want to point out that you can setup your own database with AWS, and just point it in your env vars for heroku.

She has a much broader group of friends.<p>I&#x27;ve identified that one of the characteristic of women interacting is a asking questions in an unprompted sort of way. Something I consider to be &quot;prying&quot;, and yet it opens up other conversations which deepen the relationship.<p>My current position is that I was never exposed to good role models for building relationships with other men, and childhood homophobic sorts of taunts actually sensitized me to a notion of being &quot;too close&quot; to someone. While my wife has no trouble at all saying &quot;love you&quot; to her friends, my early programming makes that really hard for me with my male friends.<p>The process of building friendships is a process of developing trust and vulnerability, something which is hard to do outside of shared life threatening experiences. At some level in my younger days I always felt I was in competition with the other men around me. How do you make yourself vulnerable to your competitor? You don&#x27;t of course. To get past that I&#x27;ve had to reassess a really large chunk of the structure in my brain about evaluating my own success and understanding whether or not I was under or over performing on my internal metrics of success.<p>Bottom line for me is that unpacking all the threads that were hindering my ability to make close friendships walked me back to kindergarten.

10665233,comment,10651857,10663073,0,0,mattnewport,,,"I think you somewhat misunderstand how prices work to convey information. Price on its own has never provided sufficient information to make a purchasing decision. As a one dimensional, discrete numeric value, how could it? It is always necessary for the buyer to use additional information to determine what a particular purchase is worth to them. If it is priced below the value they determine it has to them then it may be a worthwhile purchase. Wide availability of product information and consumer reviews on the internet makes finding the information to estimate a purchase&#x27;s value to a given individual easier and this makes the price mechanism work more effectively.<p>What price does convey quite effectively in a hard to fake way is the value to the seller and thus some indication of the resources that went into the manufacture of a product. All else being equal, a more durable product will tend to have a higher price reflecting the greater resources required to produce it.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree with much else that you say, with the caveat that I think buying say a wood plane makes sense for relatively few individuals unless they happen to derive particular pleasure from woodwork as a hobby or intend to do it as a business. The &#x27;sharing economy&#x27; is a way the internet makes it possible for more people to amortize the cost between them and does change that calculation somewhat by making more efficient use of resources.",1449084722

I recently became more aware of this factor after spending some time with a couple less fortunate kids going into college for computer science.  It&#x27;s amazing how a small amount of well-placed guidance from an experienced mentor can have a dramatic effect.  In this case it was three things:<p>1. Learn vim (or emacs)<p>2. Use Linux and the command line<p>3. Use git<p>One of the guys started this semester.  He&#x27;s already a bright guy and would have been near the top of his class without me, but those three simple things make him look like a magician to his classmates.  In the course of getting helping him get set up with Linux I also became aware how much of an advantage my middle class upbringing gave me.  Something relatively basic like having a decent laptop can actually be a big obstacle.  $1000 is a lot of money to a lot of people.  Now I&#x27;m sure some people will say that you don&#x27;t need to spend $1000 to get started with a usable computer.  That&#x27;s true, but there <i>are</i> useful things that you can do with a $1000 computer that the much more affordable computers can&#x27;t do.<p>Another anecdote.  A few years ago I was in a climbing gym and I tried slacklining.  It seemed impossible so I didn&#x27;t do anything more with it.  A few years later someone suggested that it does wonders for your balance so I decided I wanted to learn.  Then by luck I happened to run across some people slacklining and over the course of a couple days I was able to spend some time with them practicing.  Their guidance got me over an initial hump that seemed insurmountable from the outside.<p>So yes, &quot;environment&quot; should DEFINITELY be added to my list!",1449083616

The cost of developing autonomous asteroid mining equipment, finding asteroids suitable for mining, getting this equipment to the asteroid, operating it, maintaining it, and shipping the mined product back to earth must be in the billions of dollars, if not more. This article talks about moving an asteroid into lunar orbit to make this easier, but it seems to me that the amount of delta-v needed to do that would be staggering, not to mention that even if we had engines capable of generating that amount of thrust, we would still need to somehow get them out of the Earth&#x27;s gravity well and to the asteroid in question. Plus, even if we could somehow do any of the above, is there any evidence that asteroids like the article&#x27;s $50 billion platinum asteroid even exist? As far as I am aware, less than 10% of the asteroids in the asteroid belt are metallic in nature (most are composed of carbon and silicon), and the metallic asteroids we do know about are all iron and nickel based, not exactly high-value metals. I&#x27;m all for space exploration, both by governments and by private enterprises, but this whole thing seems completely far-fetched and impractical.",1449082818

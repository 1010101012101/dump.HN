8878405,comment,8876291,8876291,0,0,menssen,,,"Charter school grad here. From a school which often came out as the top school in the state on standardized tests, in a high income suburb in a state with an already strong public education system (MN).<p>Anecdotal observations:<p>From what I could tell, the success of the school was due to three things:<p>1. Parents who had available time, money, and energy to devote to the school. This would likely be less true in a lower income area, but as has been mentioned elsewhere, could account for higher average performance of schools that parents actively chose to put their kids in, regardless of location.<p>2. Excellent staffing, mostly due to the attractiveness of working in an environment with more freedom to innovate.<p>3. That the environment was different enough from the huge suburban public schools nearby that some students would perform better in that kind of environment.<p>One other thing I noticed that I haven&#x27;t heard mentioned before, which is a situation that is unique to looking at the upper end of public schools and income brackets rather than the lower: the school I went to was not good at playing the college prep game. All the courses were difficult, so nobody had any &quot;honors&quot; courses on their transcript. GPAs were generally lower. Fewer extracurricular activities were available because of the size of the school. These facts resulted in a lower number of students going on to prestigious post-secondary institutions than you would expect from an otherwise high performing school.<p>ALL of these observations point to the conclusion that Charter schools are really just an &quot;alternative&quot;, and naturally some alternatives will be an improvement and some will be a failure.<p>I like this article because it indicates that charter schools specifically help marginalized groups (black, poor), which fits nicely with the idea that having alternative environments in general is good for some students, and also matches my personal experience. (I promise this is the only time I will ever claim &quot;white male nerd&quot; as a marginalized group.)",1421128795

I don&#x27;t know if &quot;signal failure&quot; is some sort of catch all error code but it seems to happen an awful lot.<p>My wife and I have spent years traveling and spent significant blocks of time in a lot of big cities (most admittedly not as large as London). Tokyo, Bangkok, Taipei, Kuala Lumpur etc and have had a combined 0 delays on public transport within any of those cities. Not saying they never occur, maybe we have just been lucky, but we have had 3+ years of regular use and 0 delays.<p>We recently spent a month in London and had at least half a dozen delays on the tube. Actually, more than that. On our way to the airport the tube was delayed 3 separate times on that single journey due to congestion.",1421128726

8878399,story,,,1,0,tburns,"Ask HN: Would you use this? (Self-Hosted Pasetbin/Gist Application)",,"In trying to come up with a fun side project with a small enough scope, the idea I&#x27;m currently settled on is essentially a self-hosted, open source Pastebin/Gist application. I feel as though something like this would be very useful for development teams (especially remote teams?) who want to share snippets of code/text/etc., but need to do so in a closed, secure environment.<p>If this is something you would use, what features would you care about the most?<p>I feel as though a project like this needs to have a very streamlined deployment mechanism and a small footprint for external dependencies. Backing each gist/paste with a Git repository like Gist does would prevent the application from being installed in environments such as Heroku. When you use Gist, do you generally go back and edit your gists or care about the version history? Personally I don&#x27;t very often. Is the fork feature of Gist or the ability to easily download and update them by cloning them as Git repositories an important feature to you? These are the main questions I&#x27;d like to answer for myself before I really start to work on the project, because of the obvious impact the answer will have on the basic architecture and deployment options.<p>A slightly related tangent to this idea was to have a portion of the client-side part of the application be something like Mailvelope (https://github.com/mailvelope/mailvelope) that manages a client-side GPG keyring and allows you to encrypt/decrypt the contents of each gist/paste before it goes to the server (you would be able to choose among any other user in the application who has their public key uploaded as a recipient, and your private key would be importable to an encrypted client-only store of some sort in the browser). I&#x27;m not sure how much use this particular feature would be for the main use case I envisioned above, but it would be fun to implement :)<p>Looking forward to anyone&#x27;s feedback!",1421128690

I think nurture is important (obviously), but much more for emotional well-being (that whole unconditional love thing), for character (that whole right-from-wrong thing) and for values than for the essence of their person.  I also don&#x27;t think that &quot;you&#x27;ll win to start with&quot; -- in most cases when I&#x27;ve seen kids pushed into things that are fundamentally not in their disposition, the effort doesn&#x27;t clear the end of the runway.

Obviously that is not the case.&quot;<p>Mr. Watson could have written a one-line letter or a ten-line letter, and it would be clear the latter would be more intrinsically valuable, because of the increased effort spent to write it; the increased amount of value is irrelevant to the amount of ink on the paper, and only partially relevant to what the words actually say.<p>You named an example that is less relevant to time, but it doesn&#x27;t mean time spent performing a work cannot be valuable in and of itself.<p>For example, a mother spending time knitting a scarf for her child would produce a higher value in terms of intrinsic goods than if a mother went to Walmart to purchase a scarf for her child - even if the scarf she knitted and the one from Walmart are physically identical. The time spent knitting is valuable, intrinsically. You can compare the time as well - She could have knitted a small woollen finger ring, or a scarf - and it would be a clear the latter has a larger intrinsic value because of the larger effort spent.<p>&quot;Mainstream economics isn&#x27;t missing anything, these students are just mistaken.&quot;<p>If mainstream economic theory can&#x27;t understand why people don&#x27;t relocate to find jobs with $100 more worth of utility, in exchange for losing access to close family members, then is it not missing something? How is it not missing anything if it cannot explain why a child supported by $10,000 of goods and services purchased by its parents is better off than a child supported by $10,000 of goods and services purchased by the state, where intrinsic goods like value in having members of society supported by other family members, rather than by the state, is completely ignored?<p>Mainstream economics theory cannot explain or value intrinsic goods like - kindness, generosity, acceptance, status, love of a parent, romantic attraction, being attractive.

Since the chanting should have it&#x27;s meaning, those who chant should know the meaning. Without knowing the meaning, it will just become a meaningless ritual. Hence, when chanting in my society, usually below the pali text there is English text which help the chanters to understand the chanting.",1421126065

There are a few good schools, mostly heavily leaning Asian --due to parental acculturation.  But, for the most part the schools are very under-performing.  I wish there was something to get them to address the issue --and parents need to stop thinking &#x27;education&#x27; and aptitude begin and stop in the classroom.<p>Also, it would help to have special schools for children of parents for whom education was not part of their upbringing --those kids need some full blown indoctrination to get them to see schooling as an essential part of their lives and not something which interrupts their lives.",1421125771

8878263,comment,8875917,8877943,0,0,AndrewKemendo,,,"The good thing about a lot of study and thinking is that if you do it correctly, sometimes the results are strikingly simple when explained. There is also quite a bit of simplification there, if only just to make the point easier.<p>The reason I came away with those three things is that for the most part when you dissect a lot of case studies what you find is that parental involvement isn&#x27;t actually that impactful so long as those three guidelines hold.<p>Yes more involvement with your children is better, as we see with studies about language acquisition. In those cases however what was found was that the reason that parents were talking to their infants and toddlers more was because they had the time to and were not working or putting them in front of a television (in some cases bordering on neglect). The same held true for physical ailments like later in life issues with hypertension and diabetes from low nutritional diets. All of their root causes were poverty and almost always related was poor maternal education.<p>The simple answer to your question though is, the rest of those things don&#x27;t make nearly as much impact, by magnitudes as the big three. So focusing on getting those things right is really crucial. The rest are just kind of window dressing and honestly, largely just make parents feel like they are having a big impact.<p><i>But at least 80% of people don&#x27;t have access to the right resources and have to make do with what they have, and I was hoping for advice that could be more helpful to them.</i><p>I think the right advice is do whatever it takes to get out of poverty and into a more traditionally successful &quot;class&quot; without beating your kids along the way. If you had a modest income then start networking with chamber of commerce members and other community leaders. Attend hackathons to expose your kids to people who are going to be successful etc... It&#x27;s not that obtuse of a thing to figure out how to apply I don&#x27;t think.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.zerotothree.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zerotothree.org/</a>

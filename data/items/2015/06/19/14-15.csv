The anti-vaccine movement resulted in a lot of people touting science as the reason you should trust vaccines, conveniently ignoring the fact that it appears to have started from a phony scientific study. The fact that the phrase &quot;a new study ... has found exactly the opposite&quot; can be published by serious researchers is exactly why we shouldn&#x27;t be going around proposing that people be legally forced to inject themselves with things because they&#x27;re considered scientifically illiterate. As Scott Adams said in his piece on the subject, &quot;Science isn’t about being right every time, or even most of the time. It is about being more right over time and fixing what it got wrong.&quot; [1] That should be kept in mind by people who are publishing, reporting on, and reading these studies.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.dilbert.com/post/109880240641/sciences-biggest-fail#ixzz3dWKWf6k5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.dilbert.com/post/109880240641/sciences-biggest-f...</a>",1434725968

She wanted a simple scheduling service, with a  panic button — a way for her to let others know if she was running late.<p>Ironically, she works at Redpoint VC, but had trouble attracting developers to her idea. I built the MVP, conducting UserTesting.com focus groups to gather feedback from a busy, educated “soccer mom” demographic and iterated on a “wizard based” signup flow. Users reported it being better than the current email / spreadsheet / shared calendar approach they use now, some interest in paying for the service on a subscription basis. Key request was a native mobile app version, and, confusingly, a Craig&#x27;s List like rideshare social matching service.<p>MVP is built on Parse.com / Backbone / Bootstrap, waiting for the right time to build out an iOS app; likely the start of a new school year.<p>Obviously the growth opportunities are in service-based, market-making transportation providers like Uber, BlaBlaCar/Carpooling.com, whereas this is more of a scheduling app with a long history of similar but failed approaches (as a quick search of ‘carpool’ on HN will show!)<p>Still, I like the feeling that I&#x27;m helping make other people&#x27;s lives easier.<p>Feedback & ideas for good mobile app design most welcome!",1434724806

Considering that the ReactOS Foundation does not take decisions in the same way as corporations do, it&#x27;s possible for DirectX to become again just some install-able frame-work (or frame-game if you will). So, DirectX may not be so badly needed as you imply it to be.<p>EDIT: Somewhat related - regarding OpenGL, ReactOS&#x27; decision was to bundle only the version 1.4, because installing the graphic card&#x27;s drivers will give you exactly the last version of OpenGL your card can handle, that is - if you&#x27;d be interested in accessing the card&#x27;s capacity (beyond what the default bundled ReactOS driver will give you) in the first place.

Choose any parsing algorithm you like, but parsers must be defined in a BNF-like syntax.<p>Doesn&#x27;t sound hard to do in (macroless) scala. Just create objects and methods with appropriate names - and for the optimization part just ensure everything is lazy and preserves the structure so you have the AST available in the language and can do your optimizations at that level (which doesn&#x27;t have to mean interpreting - we can use the type system to perform these computations at compile time[1]). The syntax will probably end up being slightly differently punctuated from actual BNF, which is a tradeoff for having syntax that follows the ordinary rules of the language and is accessible to e.g. an IDE.<p>I can agree that languages need to be able to perform complex transformations at compile time. But this doesn&#x27;t have to be exactly the same kind as the compiler does itself, and as long as the language provides a sufficiently lightweight way of constructing an AST &quot;in&quot; the language, I think it&#x27;s worthwhile making an explicit distinction between such ASTs and the AST of the language itself.<p>[1] I can imagine you objecting that this is just a macro system by another name, but it isn&#x27;t (except in the trivial sense of turing equivalence). It has a different grain: it&#x27;s more natural to create companion trees that mirror the structure of the AST exactly, and less natural to transform the AST by moving nodes around. And any such companions are explicitly distinct from the &quot;original&quot; tree, and the structure naturally lets you see both.",1434724217

This shows that the efficiency of a 4790k is actually greater than a 4370. Part of the reasoning behind that is because while the cores and the threads double (As well as the Smart Cache), the GHz ratio lowers overall, even though the 4790k has a higher clock rate. This makes the efficiency of the CPU much better than the i3 being compared.<p>So realistically, the i7 is actually a better option when using CPU intensive tasks, while the i3 is preferable when doing simple tasks such as browsing online. So while the maximum watt draw of the i3 is a flat amount, the i7 can potentially draw 30W more, which could cause a significant drop in battery life.<p>Another issue with watt usage could be because of the extra 2 cores. The i7 would basically be keeping both cores powered and ready, which could cause some extra watt usage even when not needed.<p>Look into Power Options, as well as CPU throttling and turning off cores if the extra Watt usage is that much of a bother.",1434724195

9744940,comment,9741625,9744517,0,0,vitalyd,,,">The key is that most of the effort is not where most of the data is. It&#x27;s the small percentage of data (say, database index) that requires the biggest development effort, and you want the best mechanism to assist not where most bytes are stored, but where the most effort is invested.<p>There&#x27;s also substantial amount of code around dealing with i/o efficiently (and not churning garbage), both net and disk (if there&#x27;s any persistence involved in the product).<p>>I think that people who author such systems/libraries know when to rely on the GC and when not to.<p>Perhaps there&#x27;s more awareness now, but there are plenty of JVM based systems where moving off-heap (and/or changing code to ease GC workload) came much later in the dev cycle.<p>>Going off-heap for large, known-lifespan data sets in Java has been widespread -- idiomatic, almost -- for at least five years now, if not ten. There are so many libraries that do that, that it&#x27;s very, very simple. Again -- that&#x27;s just where most data lies, not where the most effort is required. You end up with a very small percentage of your code that is not quite &quot;beginner&#x27;s Java&quot; -- that&#x27;s not swimming against the current; that&#x27;s hitting a few strokes for one tiny section of the journey. It&#x27;s managing the transactions and update to the indexes that requires 95% of the code, and where you end up thanking your lucky stars for a good GC.<p>IME, you end up not using a good bulk of JDK and 3rd party libs because they allocate frivolously.  You end up having to look at internals of other code to see if they allocate or not since nobody in the java space cares about documenting that aspect (because allocation is mundane).  If you then need to tune GC knobs, may the force be with you.  On top of that, once you go off-heap, you&#x27;re doing roughly the same style of block memory management that you&#x27;d do natively, except less efficiently (e.g. some Unsafe operations aren&#x27;t JIT optimized as well, some operations aren&#x27;t even intrinsics so you get JNI call overhead, you always get zero&#x27;d memory if you call Unsafe.allocate() even if you then overwrite everything, etc).  You&#x27;re probably going to now tell me that getting 90% of the performance is fine ...<p>I suggest you look at some non-managed OSS systems that deal with high-perf workloads.  Your posts always make it sound like it&#x27;s nigh near impossible to build anything of the sort without GC, which is ridiculous.

Participating in groups is an excellent way to get noticed by people you want to notice you.<p>3) Publishing: LinkedIn added a sort of blogging platform last year that lets individuals publish longer form posts.  These can be used for whatever purpose you choose: project details, topical thoughts, career learnings, whatever.  They&#x27;re all then associated with your profile.<p>4) Projects & documents: Most programmers these days have a Github account or similar, where a portfolio is pretty easily visible, but if you&#x27;re not in that kind of a role it&#x27;s not always obvious how to present your work.  LinkedIn lets you upload documents & video, and lets you associate projects with your job history (as well as letting you tag colleagues so they show up in your projects, too).<p>5) Recommendations.  Endorsements are bollocks, but recommendations can be helpful, especially from previous or current managers.  This is still iffy and I doubt many recruiters or hiring managers actually read them, but they fall under the &quot;can&#x27;t hurt&quot; category, especially since you have to vet and manually approve any recommendations before they appear on your profile.<p>6) Job applications & recruiter contact.  Say you find a job listing, perhaps on LinkedIn or perhaps not.  The odds are good that the company also listed it there.  The odds seem (in my experience) to be about 50/50 that the job listing on LinkedIn has the recruiter&#x27;s name & contact info (LinkedIn profile) associated with it.  This makes it SOOOOOO much easier to proactively go after jobs that look interesting, and as well to subsequently make direct contact with interviewers & hiring managers.<p>Take all this with a shaker of salt, because it may not actually be useful for you at all, but it has been extremely helpful for me.  I&#x27;ve spent quite a bit of time cultivating my account and working on my profile the past few year and it&#x27;s reaped benefits.

For us, there&#x27;s a 2 day period where we&#x27;re testing out the upcoming release. Developers will be fixing bugs on this release branch, and also commiting new code for the subsequent release. If we had one branch with tags, developers would need to keep all their new code on feature branches until a release is completed, and the likelihood of accidentally releasing an untested feature gets a lot higher (one advantage of having two branches is that you can treat your production branch with a lot more care)",1434722741

I don&#x27;t think I agree.<p>I think having the Dev branch is useful. Consider this actual scenario at my current workplace.<p>1. We have 4 developers. Nature of the project is such that we can all work independently on different features/changes.<p>2. We have Production/QA/Dev environment.<p>3. When we are working on our individual features, we do the work in individual branches and merge in to Dev branch (which is continuously deployed).This lets us know of potential code conflicts between developers in advance.<p>4. When a particular feature is &#x27;developer tested&#x27;, he/she merges it into a rolling release branch (Release-1.1, Release-1.2 etc) and this is continuously deployed to QA environment. Business user does their testing in QA environment and provides sign off.<p>5. We deploy the artifacts of the signed off release branch to Production and then merge it in to the master and tag it.<p>Without the development branch, the only place to find out code conflicts will be in the release branch. I and others on my team personally prefer the early feedback we can get thanks to the development branch.<p>Advantages of an explicit merge commit:<p>1. Creating the merge commit makes it trivial to revert your merge. [Yes, I know it is possible to revert the merge but it&#x27;s not exactly a one step process.]<p>2. Being able to visually see that set of commits belongs to a feature branch. This is more important to me (and my team) than a &#x27;linear history&#x27; that the author loves.<p>We have diverted from GitFlow in only one way, we create all feature/release/bugfix branches from &#x27;master&#x27; and not &#x27;develop&#x27;.<p>Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong, GitFlow is not simple but it&#x27;s not as complicated as author seems to suggest.

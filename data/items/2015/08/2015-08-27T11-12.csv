There are many more reasons other than what the article states as to why it doesn&#x27;t deal with realities of software (e.g. data oriented programming solves some of them). OOP principles are likely one of the reasons it takes so long to train fresh-out-of-college employees, as they first need to learn how to forget that utter bullshit.<p>However, that does not mean that OOP languages are a bust. It is only the OOP <i>principles</i> that are a problem.<p>So far my experience goes, I&#x27;ve learned to mostly stop creating analogues of real-world things (as OOP principles would have it), except where it makes sense to, and instead use OOP features to create distinct <i>responsibilities.</i> Turns out OOP languages are identical to, let&#x27;s say, &quot;responsibility oriented programming&quot; languages.<p>OOP languages can also be used for other things, as previously mentioned: data oriented programming.

And those assumptions, barring certain issues that are known and understood, are being constantly corrected.<p>What exactly do climate contrarians have? They dispute individual pieces of data but have no cohesive hypothesis to explain the observations of changes in the natural environment.<p>Typical example: someone will dispute the data regarding temperature change. So let&#x27;s assume that it turns out there are inconsistencies in temperature readings. Then what&#x27;s the natural phenomenon that explains the exponential increase in glacial melt across the world?<p>Another one: they dispute the influence of CO2 emissions on climate.

Monads are I think the best example for Haskell; particularly in how they behave with respect to functions, which fits quite nicely with a categorical point of view.<p>> I think that Haskell is better if you are mathematically minded and interested in thinking (a lot!) about abstractions.<p>I&#x27;m not sure you can be mathematically minded in the pure mathematics sense (which is what Haskell draws on) without being interested in thinking a lot about abstractions. If you are more focused on concrete mathematics, then Haskell is unlikely to be your ideal language, but when people reference mathematics in regards to the language I suspect they are referring to the pure variant. In any case, I am, which is I think most of the confusion here.<p>> Just like I don&#x27;t require the developer using my database to be familiar with data structures and concurrency, I don&#x27;t want those interested in formal verification requiring me to change my programming style to make their job easier.<p>The only built in formal verification I can think of in Haskell is the type system. In that case, I think your analogy breaks down; I&#x27;m not sure how one can manage to program (effectively) in any language without understanding its type system. If you are referring to an external static analysis tool, then I&#x27;m not sure how you can put that on Haskell itself.<p>> a language designed to make a machine&#x27;s reasoning easier would also do the same for a human<p>I believe it does for humans who come from a pure math background, in the same way programmers who know an object oriented language will find it easier to grasp another object oriented language. Moreover, it seems pretty clear that this is no a coincidence; it was the driving force behind Haskell&#x27;s  most fundamental design (e.g. Curry Howard) and its library (e.g. monads). So if you (as you say) are not interested in abstract mathematics, then it is no wonder you don&#x27;t care for its methods.<p>> Language designers should spend their time thinking how humans think about computation and how they interact with computers, not how to make programming models fit certain branches of math.<p>Unless, of course, they are focusing on humans that are not only well versed and comfortable with certain branches of math, but prefer that mode of thinking. Haskell&#x27;s unofficial motto of &quot;avoid success at all costs&quot; makes me think that focusing on this demographic is likely one of the language&#x27;s design features, as opposed to making the best language ever for everybody. In any case, I would argue it is good for mathematicians, but not that all of the effort to move to that way of thinking is something universally useful for programmers.",1440674149

Western society has become consumption focussed and so the production of goods and services for consumers has swelled. But this has a natural end as the resources used to generate the goods run out.<p>In short one might say that machines will enable us to produce even more and open even more areas of manufacture and consumption, areas that were previously unknown - we&#x27;ll be in flying cars and every item of clothing will have a computer in it and ... - but that relies on infinite resources. Without sufficient resources there is a natural brake on our ability to produce out of such a crisis in jobs.<p>Moreover there are certain costs to production that we have not paid, the current ecological state of the planet, the increased climate change, the other ecological impacts from chemical abuse (eg fracking), deforestation, stripping of raw materials - we haven&#x27;t really paid for these things (proper filtering of toxins, development of renewable energy, clean-up of chemical impacts, planting of new forest, etc.) instead we&#x27;ve been on a relatively free ride.

I don&#x27;t think he would be that careless if the info was really valuable and he intended to profit from it, ie. if he really &quot;stole&quot; it and valued it. It sounds pretty plausible that he used it only to understand the value of his options. Making enemies and giving them the opening to bring in FBI seems to be his main sin here.

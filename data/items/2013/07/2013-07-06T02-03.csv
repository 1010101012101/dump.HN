5997739,comment,5996712,5996712,20,0,robfig,,,"Author here, to provide a bit of context.<p>Initially, this was just a fun project to see if I could replicate the magical Play! 1.x experience in much-less-magical Go.  (Spoiler alert: yes)<p>Along the way, I started thinking more seriously about the right way to put together web applications and did more research into how Rails and Play 2.x are structured. Although Play 1.x was amazing, I think that there are some obvious areas for improvement -- the design of 2.x seems to be much better (although I&#x27;m personally allergic to Scala).<p>So the goal posts have shifted. I see this ending up as two things, conceptually:<p>1. A framework like Rack, in the sense of being a straightforward interface for writing and composing aspects of web applications.  (Revel calls them Filters).  Some components (Router, TemplateLoader) have defined interfaces so that other components can use them (but most components do not).<p>2. A default stack of components that work well together out of the box.  No size fits all, but the two concrete use cases I have in mind are writing large business applications and REST APIs.<p>The goal is that the revel package shrinks to encompass just the &quot;Rack&quot;-like framework, and the revel command line tool can generate a project with the default components set up.<p>This appears to be achievable; it just requires a bit of work, and I have been quite busy with the day job.  More people are using it than I anticipated, so I would like to complete the core design so that it can be properly released.<p>=====<p>APPENDIX (EDIT)<p>FAQ: &quot;Why not just use vanilla Go, since it already provides X, Y, and Z&quot;:<p>Go certainly ships with more components in place than any language I&#x27;m aware of, but I still think there is a lot of value in providing a default stack of stuff with a fixed, conventional app organization in terms of lowering the cognitive load bar.<p>If you are making a single endpoint and are a Golang whiz, then Revel is not for you.  But for many things it&#x27;s about the concepts more than the code.  For example, the code dealing with the flash cookie is not many lines; most of the value there is having it integrated, documented, and exampled.  Empirically, I believe that Rails unlocked a latent desire for web development by lower the bar -- I think Revel can lower the bar for web development with Go in the same way.<p>Lastly, there is something to be said for having an integrated web framework instead of a franken-app composed of various libraries.  Take parsing parameters as an example.  With a library, how can you get close to the ease that Revel provides? [1]<p>You may think it&#x27;s dumb, but I find it so much nicer to simply accept parameters as the type that I want them in, and let Revel figure it out instead of me having to figure out the right strconv / etc function to call.  The goal is for Revel to take care of all that stuff and let me focus on the higher level stuff.<p>[1] <a href=""http://robfig.github.io/revel/manual/binding.html#action_arguments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robfig.github.io/revel/manual/binding.html#action_arg...</a>",1373079338

However, here goes anyway.<p>Could a cryptographer please explain why it&#x27;s not feasible to use multiple such PRNG algorithms in both series and parallel, perhaps even shuffling their order dynamically, at, err, random?<p>Surely most attacks on PRNGs are based upon the assumption that their state can be modelled to expose weaknesses. By viewing an entire, shifting, &#x27;topology&#x27; of PRNGs as a single polymorphic source for pseudorandom data, surely this class of attack becomes much more difficult and we avoid either placing absolute trust in a single PRNG author, input entropy source, or a single mathematical approach.<p>I suppose this has already been done to the extent reasonable and that tradeoffs versus performance and available entropy input rates are probably responsible.

C and C++ are involved in one way or another in pretty much every other case.<p>If you refer to the original post in this thread, you will see that it was about the supposed unsuitability of C++ for web development. When we look at the entire picture, however, we do see that such sentiment is quite wrong. C and C++ play an absolutely huge role in modern web development and web applications, regardless of what some people may think.",1373076589
5997635,comment,5997368,5997368,3,0,mistercow,,,">* Much of the thermal mass in the garage consists of cars, which have recently driven in from the hot surface and are therefore hot.<p>>...<p>>* The cars generate a lot of waste heat as they drive around within the garage.<p>Cars remain exceptionally hot long after they&#x27;ve been parked. That has little to do with their carrying heat from the surface, and much to do with the fact that they run on a constant stream of controlled gasoline explosions. Once parked, they will radiate that heat into the garage. I think this is the most likely explanation for why garages tend to be hot.<p>Also, for weak evidence: I have never paid that close attention to it, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that I&#x27;ve been cold in a parking garage when I came back to my car very late at night.",1373076519

5997627,comment,5996425,5997515,3,0,lsh123,,,"In my statement I kind of assumed that all the &quot;cheap&quot; optimizations in the framework are already done (e.g. PHP APC cache is enabled, lazy classes/configs loading is implemented, etc.) so we compare &quot;apples-to-apples&quot;: a highly optimized C++ framework to a highly optimized, say, PHP framework (can&#x27;t comment about Ruby - didn&#x27;t have experience building/running large-scale apps on it). And of course, it all depends on the application itself. Fetching single &quot;narrow&quot; rows by primary key is obviously cheap and nobody cares. However, you have to dig through a table larger than 500G with multiple indexes is not so cheap.<p>And the reason why you don&#x27;t see a lot of DB servers is that it is HARD to scale DB by just adding servers (I am ignoring for a second non-SQL servers w/o joins as well as high-end Oracle and new MySQL-Galera solutions). An ACID compliant SQL DB is a single-server affair unless you invest heavily into the DB itself since it is really hard to run DB cluster even from pure operational standpoint.",1373076256

5219693,comment,5219506,5219506,3,0,jt2190,,,"This is not about offshoring (although some of the work will go overseas of course). This is about IBM's customers growing tired of the endless expense and headaches of dealing with consultant-provided software. Need an upgrade? Hire a consultant. Need a new feature? Hire a consultant. Need to reconfigure? Hire a consultant.<p>Now that corporations have grown more comfortable using Software-as-a-Service solutions, they're telling companies like IBM to stop billing for consultants and instead just take over all hosting and maintenance. Obviously IBM should try and host as efficiently as possible (that is, with as small a staff as possible) so they'll need to shed consulting labor.",1360853960
5219692,comment,5215364,5218057,5,0,snickell,,,"How to meditate: a simple, permissive, breathing meditation. A nearly-identical form of this meditation can be found in most 'meditation-based' systems. Its pretty universal.<p>What you do:
1) Sit in a comfortable position,  without shifting around, in a quiet place, with your eyes closed
2) Primary Focus: to constantly feel yourself breathing
3) Do this for about an hour<p>Likely Contingencies:
a) You ""need"" to shift around. Nothing wrong with that. What happens if you don't? Keep feeling your breath!
b) You will start thinking. Nothing wrong with that. But  can you think while constantly feeling your breath? Or are you multi-tasking now? Keep feeling your breath!
c) a+b: You think about needing to shift around. Nothing wrong with that. Keep feeling your breath!
d) You might wonder if the hour is over or not. Alternatively, if you set an alarm, you will wonder if its properly set, and if maybe you should check it. Keep feeling your breath!
e) You might need to do a million little things, check the dog's water, the task queue, the pot on the stove, whatever. Keep feeling your breath!
f) You will find yourself thinking about how you are now 'feeling your breath'. Oops, you probably just stopped feeling your breath to think that thought. Keep feeling your breath!<p>What does it mean to ""constantly feel yourself breathing""?
a) It means your attention/focus is completely on the feeling of breathing. Your conscious existence is the sensation of being 'a breathing thing'.
b) Corrolary: you probably aren't 'thinking in language'. In my experience, its not common to multitask thoughts 'in language' with a focus on physical sensation. 
c) As you begin meditating (first several times? more? less? depends...) You will context switch back and forth constantly between 'thinking in language' and 'feeling your breath'.<p>Why is this meditation interesting?
The best reply I can give is, ""Isn't it interesting enough that you can't just do such a simple thing as watch your breath without thinking about a bunch of other things?""",1360853952

He did not use real data and it was not scientific in any way. It was a thought experiment. And generally proven wrong.<p>Why it it relevant to mention this? Because the article mentioned here about Webkit references it in some attempt to connect it to the idea that Open Source or Free Software is an example of Garrett's argument.<p>However, if anything, Webkit is a counter example in an interesting way. One typical example of given to TOC is global fishing. However, if anything, global fishing is an example of large corporations exploiting a resource owned by nobody (vs a resourced owned in common). In a similar fashion, WebKit might be an example of corporations exploiting code owned by nobody.<p>Incidentally, this is not the case for many Free Software projects (vs Open Source). Because Free Software projects ARE owned by a group of people in common.

IBM has made a huge push to hire outside the USA, and according to some friends who work there have been content with attrition in the USA. I don't think outsourcing and offshoring have been resounding successes for many companies, but it makes sense that a company of IBM's size can do it right. Ultimately I see globalization as a good thing; IBM is adding value by making their operation more efficient (and of course hiring competent people in poorer countries).",1360853897

For instance, does it make sense to have the reported distance available fluctuate? That sort of behavior could be taken quite negatively by users. It could make them distrust the meter. Similarly, there is a safety aspect of always reporting the lowest estimate made by the car, even if conditions have changed more favorably. Better to have someone recharge before strictly necessary than to have someone not realize that conditions have changed after making a decision to skip a charger, and to then run out of energy.<p>I'm not saying this is what Tesla does, I am just saying that the considerations for the UI in this case are interesting, and maybe there were decisions and behaviors involved that are different than a simple function.",1360853871

I always check my fault codes before going to the mechanic.<p>>which provides diagnostic and maintenance data according to a standardized format.<p>Except the values you get won't make any sense outside of your particular model. Its like reading SMART data from a hard drive. Okay, you can generate this csv and have all this data, but without the manufacturer telling what thresholds matter (and these are arguable), its kinda meaningless. SMART was supposed to predict failures and do all sorts of things, but its kind useless in practice. I think most controllers just stupidly rely on bad blocks appearing than trying to interpret the tea leaves of SMART data.<p>With OBD systems, all this information is internal and we get a fault code when we pass a certain threshold. I think this makes it a lot easier for mechanics and lay people to work with. Data addicts, of course, will never be satisfied unless they can pull every bit out of the system, but that may not be practical or useful.

If you refuse the search and attempt to leave, they <i>might</i> not arrest you, but they <i>will</i> threaten criminal charges and very well may follow through on them.<p>Not empty threats by low-level agents. Systemic policy. Try it and show me I'm wrong.<p>The one exception is airplanes carrying 9 or fewer people: those are not subject to governmental interference (a la TSA). Many small airlines feature such planes precisely as a way to avoid unwarranted* search. If you find one offering airfare anywhere close to major airline prices (or the price of just driving to destination), let me know - seems they run about $1000/hr.

At the beginning of the war the Germans came very close to out maneuvering the French army and seizing Paris with barely a fight, ending the war instantly.  And on the eastern front the Germans very successfully used maneuver warfare to destroy one of the main Russian armies right at the beginning, allowing the Austrians to shift their troops south to compensate for their sudden betrayal by the Italians.<p>In the trenches themselves the Germans did use fancy maneuvers very successfully (see the other comment about stormtroopers), but contrary to popular opinion the trenches were never the real problem.  Both sides were able to break through a trench line when they were willing to devote enough resources throughout the war.<p>The real problem was that once the line was broken, what do you do next?  There was no motorized transport on the offence, soldiers had to travel on foot carrying all their food and supplies and nobody can keep doing that quickly for long.  And the advancing soldiers had no way of communicating with command, meaning that they couldn't adapt their attack to changing conditions.  By contrast, the defenders trying to contain the breakthrough had railroads and telegraphs to let them move around and communicate.  So while both's side can and did create breakthroughs, the only effect was to move the front back a few dozen kilometers.<p>But of course, those factors aren't obvious to the naked eye like the trenches are, so are often forgotten.<p>By the time world war II rolled around attacking forces had internal combustion engines and the radio that let them have the same maneuverability and communications as the defenders.  But as the Japanese and Germans found, while superior maneuver might let you defeat stronger foes, if you fight someone who is so much bigger that they can absorb defeat after defeat and still come on strong sooner or later they'll up their game, figure out how to fight as well as you do, and crush you.",1360852061

5219533,comment,5218227,5218227,4,0,jws,,,"(Apologies to the OpenDylan folk, I find I wrote this in the past tense. Just my POV.)<p>A Historical View of Dylan<p>Back in the day we used Dylan heavily for generating enterprise middleware for the C++ programers, writing X11 applications, and generating web pages when the web finally arrived.<p>It was like a Lisp with a world class object system, neatly disguised in a Pascal feeling syntax so you could grab commodity programmers and get them up and running. Any programmer with eyeballs could read the code. To many eyes it looks verbose, but with a nice editor mode it typed quickly, e.g. you never typed ""define variable"", you hit a key, expanded the statement, filled in the blanks, and headed on.<p>Multimethods, value based dispatch, multiple inheritance, and open ancestor classes all together without warts is a lot of power. Of course, don't point that fully armed and operational object system at your foot.<p>Ah yes, you say, but how do you do eval and all those Lisp macro things from a Pascal syntax? We didn't. While many smart people struggled to make spectacular Dylan compilers, we happily used Mindy, the tiny byte code interpreter. It was the mid '90s. 32MB RAM in a 66MHz i386. What we lost in CPU efficiency we picked back up in memory footprint. In those days you did something else while building your software, (not surf the web of course, maybe poll ftp sites to see if there was a new ""init"" to compile for your Linux machine since distributions weren't really invented yet), g++ had a 1 in the first version digit. If C++ had templates, they were so ludicrously bloated that you couldn't afford the RAM to use them. egcs hadn't forked then eventually killed the abomination that gcc 1 had become. With Mindy our builds were instantaneous and it ran pretty well too. Even the ""stop the world and copy everything"" garbage collector worked well in our GUI programs once we figured out to detect and force impending collections at times when the user wouldn't notice, like right after they selected a menu item, rather than letting the GC trigger automatically in the middle of a button draw.<p>Sadly, after a promising start, Dylan languished. Apple refocusing away from Dylan was a big part of it, but I think there was a bigger problem, perhaps part of the reason Apple moved away (plus timing issues, Dylan missed the Newton moment). The macro system was so insanely difficult to understand that I don't think more than 5% of our programmers could have fully understood it. I'm being quite literal here. It was a language that anyone could read and understand combined with a macro system so byzantine that statistically speaking no one could comfortably use it. You could define whole new Pascal looking syntax constructs, flow control, or whatever you wanted with it probably after somehow altering you brain into some transhuman construct capable of understanding the macro system. Notice how in the linked book, ""Macros"" is the last chapter? Clearly the author went mad and was no longer able to communicate with humans.<p>Edit: Added this little forward looking section<p>Given a do over on Dylan, I would whisper packrat parser in the ear of the language designers. Replace the macro system with the ability to dynamically augment the parser. This gives you a model that a reasonable number of programmers will understand, an opportunity for meaningful error messages, and essentially unlimited potential, for both good and evil. It wouldn't have worked in the '90s, too much memory required, but we aren't there anymore. Want to add SQL support? Add a module. Give your language a ""select"" statement. Make it a loop construct if you want to stream process the results. Your SQL statements get syntax checked at compile time. Screw pasting up commands and substituting placeholders. Write SQL right there in the middle of your code and use your language variables willy nilly.<p>Edit Edit: Ok, don't repeat all the text twice.",1360851871

Both of these are true, they've been indoctrinated to believe in this system, except maybe the ones like the writer of this story who were born in a camp and got less indoctrination.<p>The sad thing is, you can see this very same thing play out repeatedly in history. The way the germans let the nazis take over, even after it was clear they were up to no good.  The way there was no revolution to overthrow the soviet state in the USSR.<p>You see these same mechanisms happening here in america today-- people claiming that ""health care is a right"" which is essentially saying they have the right to enslave everyone else for their own benefit.<p>And there's the error- they think ""the rich"" or ""everyone else"" is going to be forced to pay for their wellbeing, never realizing that they are calling for their own enslavement.<p>Pair the idea that you have a ""right"" to make others pay for healthcare (and other things) with the claim by these same people that you don't have a right to self defense (eg: own guns.)  The latter is even in the constituttion.<p>You'd think this would cause a dissonance in their head, but the party ideology is so strong they never connect the two.<p>And when americans are being herded into camps, long disarmed, and forced to work ""from each according to his ability to each according to his needs"".... they will wish they still had guns.<p>Schools teach people to be compliant little sheep and have done so for over a century, there's a distinct connection between government control over schools and lack of critical thinking in the populace.<p>Unless things turn around soon, the US will end up in some sort of terrible state.

Interesting.<p>I want to respond to a few of the comments, as I was the main protagonist in getting this idea off the ground, CEO of the company, and the business/product guy surrounded by the talented engineers who made this happen.<p>The decision to invite the board member on to the call the day before the money was in the bank was my call. My biggest mistake of my career. I have learned from it, but it was my call and I blew it. Nothing about the situation gave us any reason to believe that we would have a problem. By the way, if anyone wants a front door key to a tier 1 VC firm, I am sure one of us still has theirs.<p>On the topic of the business model. Let's first talk about the derivation of the idea. Having spent my career in tech and Wall St, I have seen the migration of high IQ talent into spaces where the marginal utility of IQ was trending to 0. We wanted to find an opportunity where we could be smart and do new things, and that would, theory lead to money. The base thesis here was that no one had made money in the kid protection space for a while. IQ follows money. Viola. We were right - there had been no innovation in this space in a long time, and everyone was focused on keeping porn off computers. We decided to try and focus on keeping bad guys from getting to the kids.<p>We can all have an intellectual discussion about whether this was an overblown social issue or not. I don't feel like rehashing that here. What we did know is that we had a novel approach to solving this language problem, and we built an engine. We did not solve it with Bayesian analysis or ML. We went a different route, and the engine was very effective.<p>Our premise was that we could sell the software to parents. We did all the things many of you would do. Built an MVP (before there was a phrase for it), talked to customers, etc. It turns out that the axiom from real estate is true here. People lie. What parents said they would pay for, and how they reacted when using the software were totally different. Many of them expected the software to come with a computer, or be paid for by someone else. They told us they would pay for it, but in reality they expected it to come from an AV provider. That never would have surfaced in talking to customers ahead of time.<p>We then pursued a deal with McAfee. I don't know if at this point in time I can talk about that deal or not, but suffice it to say, that wasn't the golden ticket.<p>After spending time refining the business model to get parents to pay, we (as many companies do) fell backward into our business model. It started with a fortuitous call from a large company making a massively multiplayer game for kids. It turns out many of these companies who cater to kids have rooms full of moderators for in game chat. People are very expensive. Some tech found out about our software, installed it, and found it very difficult to beat. They were intrigued enough that they asked us if they could install it inside their server farm. When we took the call, every answer from us was ""yes of course"" but in reality we had no idea. Credit to Tommy and Erik for figuring out in short order how to make the demo a reality. The first company figured they could reduce their people count from 600 to 60 with our software being the first pass filter.<p>Once we figured this market opp out, we started reaching out to other companies. Long story short, we were looking at deals of $250K per year for our software. Bad timing being what it is, this was all happening around the time of the financing closing. So while Benchmark (wow, that's the first time I have said that name out loud in connection with this story in public since 2003) was moving forward on what they thought was a consumer software deal with massive growth potential, it looked like we had a business opportunity in enterprise-y software for community moderation for companies catering to minors.<p>When Benchmark pulled out (worst kick in the stomach feeling of my life having to pass that news on to the team) we scrambled. The deals from these game companies were coming along but we weren't going to have enough runway to get them closed. The eventual buyers of the company were building similar software, and they had heard our name enough in their calls with their potential customers when being told why they were not being moved forward in the deal that they wanted to buy us. It was a little bit of good luck and timing in an otherwise crap sandwich state of play.<p>To sum up:
1) We knew who we thought our customers were: parents
2) We were wrong about how they would act: parents didn't want to pay for this type of service, despite what they told us

Although, irrespective of how thoughtfully Tesla may have attempted to mitigate the fundamental problem through novel engineering, the reality seems to reflect something else. Having now entered the market in full swing, car owners are confirming this is a valid issue (especially in the very cold climate states).<p>To be fair though, sub-zero temperature battery issues generally affect EVs across the board.<i>[1]</i> However, Tesla is positioning itself as the first mainstream car manufacture to go all out on EV. Thus, surely the onus ought to fall with them, when it comes to educating the 'ICE(internal combustion engine)-driving' public as to the potential pitfalls and differences between ICEs and EVs? Instead the company seems to be ignoring the issue, hoping it will go away.<p>It's not within the public's experience, that if you leave your vehicle unplugged overnight, in extreme cold, the range can have reduced itself significantly by the next morning. Contrastingly, operating under <i>normal</i> conditions, the manual allegedly states (Page 25) about a 1% discharge rate per day. [2]<p>Now ordinarily I might say this is a once off. But it would appear, lack of adequate customer education is a recurring concern.<p>Consider the case of an early adopter (Max Drucker) that had his Tesla Roadster bricked <i>[3][4]</i>. He was told he needed to pay $40 000 for a new battery pack because he was 'negligent'. His transgression? Leaving it unplugged for 2 months in a temporary garage while renovating his home.<p>What could be negligent, is Tesla failing to highlight possible issues pertaining to their EV vehicles and how they differ from ICE expectations. Burying important or even critical details in the manual/warranty docket, seems questionable.<p>Still a huge supporter of what they are trying to achieve, but their refusal to admit <i>any</i> fault and tendency to blame the customer, is a tad off-putting.<p><i>[1]</i> <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/27/AR2011012706170.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01...</a><p><i>[2]</i> <a href=""http://www.teslamotorsclub.com/showthread.php/12188-Battery-discharges-at-a-rate-of-1-per-day-(page-25-Model-S-owners-manual)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teslamotorsclub.com/showthread.php/12188-Battery-...</a><p><i>[3]</i> <a href=""http://www.examiner.com/article/it-s-a-brick-tesla-s-batteries-under-question"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.examiner.com/article/it-s-a-brick-tesla-s-batteri...</a><p><i>[4]</i> <a href=""http://www.wired.com/autopia/2012/02/bricked-tesla-roadsters/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/autopia/2012/02/bricked-tesla-roadsters...</a>",1360851256

Khan Academy said that they have very promising results in which students perform significantly better on standardized tests.</i><p>Without numbers and studies, this sounds like self-selection to me - people doing Khan Academy courses are surely more self-motivated than people attending colleges and universities, a substantial percentage of whom probably don't really enjoy being there.<p><i>I think it's quite obvious that it's better to watch a recorded lecture than to see the teacher perform the same lecture years after year.</i><p>Do you mean obvious from some study you've heard of, or obvious to you? Because that's not <i>at all</i> obvious to me personally - in fact, the opposite is true.  I think I learn much better from in-person lecturers (providing the lecturer is good, which would have to be true in a video lecture too).  I think there are two forces at play that make this true - first, the lecturer can gauge the response of the audience and tailor his presentation - timing, level of explanation etc.  Second, the atmosphere makes me pay attention more - in much the same way as going to the cinema or to see a play in a theater is more engaging that watching the same thing on TV or YouTube.<p>I know that basically everything I've said is all anecdote and presumption, but my presumption seem just as valid (to me, more valid :-P) than yours in the absence of hard data.<p>On your point that we should <i>[give] the teachers and students better tools based on cognitive science that we discovered a long time ago</i>, I wholeheartedly agree, but it needs to be done based on scientific conclusions, not anecdata (yours or mine).",1360850528

He sees 50 miles. On a digital display at a hotel at night, he misreads the 5 as a 9, and this fits with his expectation, so he goes to bed thinking he has 90 miles of range. He wakes up and the Tesla has lost 5 miles of range inexplicably -- but it therefore has become 45 miles, which looks totally different. He calls them up complaining that the Tesla lost half of its charge overnight and some sympathetic tech support describes it as a ""software glitch.""<p>Pure gold. Thanks for the laugh.",1360850471

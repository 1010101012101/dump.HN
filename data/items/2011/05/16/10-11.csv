But arguments such as it was bought by Microsoft therefore it must be bad do not make sense.\nTo be more specific, Skype had all the valid issues it had (such as proprietary format, advertising etc.) before it was acquired by Microsoft. The only new factor is its acquisition.<p>The fact that certain companies, Microsoft, IBM etc. have an 'evil', 'corporate' air about them, whereas companies (and this is a generalization for the sake of example) such as Google and Apple are the good guys don't make sense. \nI would like to see free software promoted for its merits, and to see bogus arguments based around who makes the product to disappear from the IT world.<p>No company is less evil than any other, and whether products should be used or not should not depend on who owns them, but how the products operate.",1305543055

At the moment, I'm trying to figure out the best way to post Tweets from my web application on behalf of a user when they perform a specific action.<p>These are the options:<p>* When the user performs the action, the application will display the content that will be Tweeted, allowing the user to edit it. When they click the 'Tweet' button the form will post back to my server which will send the Tweet using the Twitter API. This method will require read and write permissions for the application.<p>* The other option is to popup a pre-filled tweet form on Twitter using Twitter's ""intent"" functionality.<p>The first one seems cleaner from a user interaction POV and has the advantage that my application knows exactly what was Tweeted, however it does require write permissions for the application.<p>So what do you folk think?  Do you balk at authorising new, relatively unknown applications with read and write privileges on your Twitter account? Or do you feel that the ability to unauthorize an application if it misbehaves is enough?<p>Should an app offer clear assurances that it will be respectful of your Twitter account as part of the sign up process?",1305542586

I don't think there are any at this point.<p>To give you an impression of things that might speak against using Skype (not that I want to imply that these should matter to you. I merely want to speak for the 'I'd like to leave (but cannot)' side):<p>1) It's proprietary. We cannot validate the protocol without reverse engineering (and even then they'd be free to break/change it). The security of Skype calls, one of the loudest arguments for using it, is dubious and it seems to be a fact by now that governments are allowed to/capable of recoding your calls.<p>2) Resource heavy: If you ever compared a Skype conference (audio only) with any other system, the resource usage is ridiculous. Mostly CPU, but also network wise.<p>3) In your face advertisements: The (unacceptable) UI constantly pops up with 'subscribe here'/'buy credits there'/'did you know all the other ways you can hand over your money'. You can turn off most of these, but an update usually leads to the very same thing.<p>4) Maybe related to the P2P architecture: The behavior is unpredictable at times. I often see people online, they don't see me. Or vice versa. I can talk to someone on Skype, but messages (say, a link) fail to be delivered. Sometimes messages queue up for hours and completely lose their meaning when they arrive at 1am, asking about having lunch.",1305542041

That, of course, would still be a subjective evaluation. It would be better, of course, more opinions means more data. In fact, I welcome people to make the same evaluation with their own collections. Enroll them in all 3 systems, create some playlists and evaluate them.  Since most people don't have access to Google Music yet, this is hard to do. Still, you can look at the playlists that I generated and make your own WTF opinions about them.  Or better yet, count the WTFs in the playlist Google created during the Google I/O keynote.

2552127,comment,2551120,2551336,5,0,camtarn,,,"Slate magazine uses a nice way of presenting footnotes, especially in the series of long-form articles it published in the last few months. They use a small grey circle with a + sign in it; when you hover over the circle, a popup appears with the footnote. Some of the long-form articles have entire paragraphs in each footnote, which seem like they've been removed to make the article flow better but preserved for the interested reader who would like more detail. Others are simply corrections or clarifications added after the fact. I'd love it if more sites picked up this convention.<p>Another site which has a particularly unique way of writing footnotes is E2 ( <a href=""http://everything2.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://everything2.com</a> ). Like Wikipedia, editors ('noders') are encouraged to link articles ('nodes') together by hyperlinking words throughout the text. Unlike Wikipedia, noders can post anything: essays, fiction, poetry.<p>Some use the hyperlinks as commentary on the main text - if you hover over them, the title of the linked node can be very different from the text of the actual link, possibly changing the meaning of a sentence (for example, ""I tell her that I'm [okay]"", with [okay] linking to the node 'I am not okay'.)<p>Occasionally, noders link entire phrases or sentences which seem interesting, even if there's no actual node with that name. There is the concept of ""filling nodeshells"": writing new and interesting content to fill a node which was created by someone linking a phrase from another node.<p>Each node also holds a grid of 'softlinks': nodes which people visited from that node. Mostly this is composed of links from the text in that node, but it can also be used for readers' commentary via the readers deliberately visiting appropriately-titled nodes.<p>More info:\n<a href=""http://everything2.com/title/The+perfect+node"" rel=""nofollow"">http://everything2.com/title/The+perfect+node</a>",1305541887

Posting on Facebook ""Does anyone here really use Google Talk?"" there was a roaring silence in response.<p>I can't for the life of me see why you would go from a minor evil service like Skype/MSN/whatever with a variety of clients to choose from to a monsterous big-brother service like Google Talk.<p>Aren't we giving Google enough power and dominance as it is?<p>Edit: To comment on the actual article, it seems to be a mix of supposedly fashionate ""Microsoft sucks"" attitude, standard ""Microsoft is evil"" paranoia and some legitimate concerns about future support for non-Microsoft platforms.<p>IMO the only one worthy of discussion would be the last one.",1305540645

Neither do the free Skype accounts, but I think on Skype you can have a video-conference with up to 4 users.<p>So if Google is going to put some resources into GTalk, then it will kick-ass (you'll just tell your friends / colleagues to download the client and to use their GMail account for login), or just use the GMail web interface (which currently is more capable than the stable desktop client :)).<p>Otherwise there is no good alternative to Skype.",1305540633

You see something similar today - parents marvelling over a child who can play on an iPad before then can even talk.",1305540510

That guy on reddit who tried it recently suddenly stopped posting after 5 days, so that doesn't help my argument either :)<p>I don't know though. I certainly appreciate what you're saying, I guess I want to believe you're wrong, but I have no evidence either way. Maybe I should try it myself to see if it works haha.",1305540330

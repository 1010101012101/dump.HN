Different observers (e.g. one moving relatively to the other with constant speed) see different ""wave functions"" representing the same state.<p>Studying all mathematically consistent possibilities of how to calculate what one observer sees if you know what the other sees leads to the possibility of particles with spin.",1300535277

There's a huge amount of work you can do without being ""the technical one"" yourself, and the great thing about this work is that it gradually leads you into a better understanding of the technical side yourself -- which you'll need to do at some point, if you want to be centrally involved in a tech business.  You don't have to write code, necessarily, but you have to learn a lot about the tech side.<p>All that really means is ""details"" -- take the best of your ideas, and start breaking it down all the way into separate pages, separate bits of data (""so we're letting teachers enter assignments here... that needs a name, description, due date -- er, wait, some teachers will have sets of assignments to do in sequence with no specific due date -- and what about extra credit assignments?"" etc.); how to enter data, organize it, show it to the users who need to see it (and how to organize them).  And so on.  What do you do when the user ""does it wrong""?  Will you handle different time zones, languages, etc.?  This is where the important work is; you have to add in solutions to problems, then remove most of your ideas and strip it down to what's most essential & useful & easy to build.<p>This process is much more difficult than the original brainstorming, but also more rewarding -- your project becomes so much closer to ""real"".",1300535245

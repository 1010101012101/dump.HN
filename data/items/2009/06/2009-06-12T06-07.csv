654270,comment,654243,654243,0,0,timdorr,,,"The thing is they're considering Etsy as their <i>only</i> sales channel in this article. Anyone that does handmade goods knows that you sell a lot at fairs, conventions and events. And if you want to stick it out online, there's also Craigslist and Ebay. But it's not like Etsy is the only way to sell your goods.<p>If I sold cars, I'm not going to do it exclusively through autotrader.com (or one of my friends, easyautosales.com ;) ). It's as simple as not putting all your eggs in one basket.",1244788007

654267,comment,654243,654243,0,0,patio11,,,"I think there are likely more women on Etsy for the reason that 9 of the most common 10 first names among customers of Bingo Card Creator are female and the last one is ambiguous: women and men like different things.<p>This does not strike me as demonstrating men's superior skill in finding renumerative activities.  It is highly likely that 95%+ of the startups here are started by men.  Most, like I suspect most Etsy sellers, will never have a single customer.<p>Incidentally, by any quantitative measure selling software works better than selling handicrafts, but of people who start a sideline in either field the overwhelming majority will not see amazing things.  I also think it is quite unlikely that most people are in it with a serious plan to replace their day job -- mostly true here and, e.g., the Business of Software boards as well.",1244787746

654262,comment,654179,654256,0,0,swombat,,,"There was an example of one guy having the police come to his house and seize his computers, before eventually returning them. Needless to say, he was shit-scared that his neighbours would find out that he was suspected of child pornography (though of course he was not guilty). His account was posted here some 6 months ago or so.<p>I think it's a matter of numbers, though. If TOR (or equivalent) was as popular as BT, even the police would realise it is pointless.",1244787151

654256,comment,654179,654245,0,0,azanar,,,"I suspect you would probably make the same argument about being a Tor endpoint.<p>Given that Tor has been available for a while, are there examples of maintainers of Tor end nodes being held accountable for the traffic they pass on behalf of others?<p>This seems bred the same philosophy as holding an ISP accountable for the traffic of its customers, or holding the administrator of 4chan accountable for what is posted on there. It seems tenuous.<p>Maybe I'm missing something. How many jurisdictions are there now where an unknowing facilitator can be held accountable for the criminal acts of those he is facilitating?<p>Either way, I'm not fond of this philosophy of scaring everyone into the clear simply to avoid gruesome labeling.",1244786416

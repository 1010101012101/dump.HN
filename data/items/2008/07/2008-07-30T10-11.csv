But given a choice of desktop application like Windows Live Writer(yeh windows only); many people would face a question? how does it matter using new web service?<p>In most of the cases I wont be pushing the same content to multiple blogs at once.<p>Sending mail is the simplest solution one can see though. Friendfeed-mailFF and now posterous. Also jason calacanis's  shifting from blogging to email platform. its all 360 degree cycle.<p>Are we redefining how to blog ( by mailing either through posterous/way jason calacanis done having exclusive mailing list)?<p>oops everything is getting redefined",1217415294

This whole thing is MSR saying, ""look, we got it wrong, and so did everyone else.  It's not just about one computer anymore.""<p>Sure, they're fixing up the way system resources are exposed and planning to make the whole OS more fault tolerant, but the key takeaway is that the whole OS is network aware.  Apps can discover storage, processors, memory, and other resources on the local trusted network, and use them without caring at all that they might be on different machines.<p>Try getting a single apache or IIS instance to run on 50 servers in a cluster, without writing all of the distribution logic in the application.  Sure you <i>could</i> separately configure a local instance on each node, and set up file syncronization or network storage, and...<p>Why federate your database when you could just add another node to the OS cluster, thereby increasing the resources available to the single DB instance?<p>The goal is to get all the infrastucture work for free.<p>I hope someone, anyone, can pull this off.  As a developer of a distributed app, let me tell you, the bar right now is WAY too high, and current operating systems, be they Windows or Linux are not up to the task.<p>[Edit: slashes caused unintentional italics]",1217414403

There were a number of phrases that struck me as... infelicitous. Most notably: ""Each time somebody sees the ads on you site, a partner site will <i>be</i> display your ad.""<p>Those little blurbs are the first impression people get from the service, and the difference between sounding like ""just some random site"" and ""a really cool, professional ad service"" will make a difference in adoption rates.

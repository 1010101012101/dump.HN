I work for a startup, and some of the vendors we are talking to are clearly geared up to sell 'Enterprise' software to 'Enterprises'.<p>But I'm CTO of a small startup, and I just want to know what the damn software does, and how much it costs. There's no procurement process, probably not much of a (detailed) business case. I need to buy or build something, and I need to know how much it will cost to buy.<p>What I do think the writer is correct about, is that software selling is moving towards a self-service/appstore model (not that I see Enterprise software sales disappearing very quickly) and eventually the Internet is likely to disrupt it like many other industries.<p>All that said, I also found the Enterprise Software sales model really painful when I worked for an Enterprise level business (""Hello IBM, can I buy a database from you?""

3651650,comment,3650826,3650826,2,0,demallien,,,"As jacques_chester has already pointed out, being an entrepreneur is all about leadership.  It's about recognizing that you are free to do what you want, and that the things that you think are stopping you are just problems to be solved, not immovable barriers.<p>I think that many entrepreneurs are young because they learned this lesson early in life from their parents.  I see kids doing amazing things whilst they're still in high school, things that I would never have tried because I thought that I was ""supposed"" to just study and do well on my report cards.  I hadn't understood that I could start doing things, real things, already.  To quote Pink Floyd:<p>Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain. \n You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today. \n And then one day you find ten years have got behind you. \n No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.<p>That realisation, that you are free, is key to being an entrepreneur, and I think that there are not many people that manage to make that realisation once they are already an adult, and it is this that keeps the number of older entrepreneurs down.  All of the usual reasons ""Oh, I have a family that I need to spend time with"", ""But I have a mortgage that I have to keep paying"" are not real barriers - or at least they are no more difficult than the other barriers that an entrepreneur is going to be confronted with. The more I look at these reasons, the more I see them as a manifestation of the fact that the person suing them has not yet had the key enlightenment that they are free, and that problems are there to be solved.",1330599093

For myself, I'm not sharing anything here that you wouldn't expect to hear in an interview if you asked the sort of questions that are being raised here.<p>Congratulations on your offer and acceptance. Honestly, don't put too much stock in anything you read about working at Apple - your experience is going to be unique, and the worst thing that can possibly happen is that you'll decide it's not for you and move on with an excellent first slot on your resum.<p>To *_95129 above; I have a slightly hard time accepting that you really had no idea when (or if) your project was going to ship. If there's one thing that every software team knows, it's what train(s) they're shipping in.<p>To be honest, if you're the sort of person that expects people to tell you things you don't need to know, you're likely to be the sort of person that wants to pass on all those things to other people that don't need to know. That may work elsewhere, but it's not a good attitude fit for Apple.<p>As for the bigger picture; obviously there isn't a simple answer there. Many pieces of various big pictures are completely out in the open. Others are kept under closer wraps until they're ready for the usual reasons.

And I feel the practice of making my code more testable improved my design skills.<p>But I found they are a maintainability issue too.  They increased the cost of making the type of changes that would require me to change the tests- and normally, changes that <i>don't</i> break interfaces don't worry me a lot even if I don't have tests.  Also, relying on the tests for a sense of confidence made me lazier about trying to really understand why the code worked.  In general, it put my head in the mode of seeing the trees rather than the forest. YMMV.<p>Nowadays I write the code as if I was going to unit test it, and then I don't write the tests.  When I do, I don't make much of a point of keeping them around; I use them basically as shortcuts to poking around in the REPL while I debug something.  I try to keep things simple enough that not much can go wrong, I try to make sure I really understand how and why it works, and I try out most representative use cases I can think about.<p>That's enough to keep my debugging time quite low.  When I do have bugs, I treat them as learning experiences: I try to understand why it happened and what can I do so I don't get more of those.",1188027746

I guess could do the latter on the client, but what if it's Aug 31st in CA and Sept 1st in MA and the user is in month view? I'm not yet ready to go all js.",1188026358

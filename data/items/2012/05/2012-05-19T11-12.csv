3995741,comment,3995559,3995686,2,0,DanBC,,,"Depends how good the research is.  But, knowing how much money is in the toy industry (an eye watering amount, even compared to some tech businesses) I suppose it's good.<p>But then just because it's researched doesn't mean it's good.  Why do girls now prefer the narrative form of a previously creative toy?  Why do lego blocks need a back story?  Is that something that girls have always wanted; is it something that's created by changes in society; is it beneficial to girls? Is it possible harmful to boys to not have the narrative toys? (Although, with all the ROBOT BATTLE IN SPACE stuff hat lego has done for years I suppose they're just re-balancing an existing skew).<p>There's a lot of research about the ""princess phase"" which is why most toys for girls are boxed in that disgusting pink - purple combination.<p>This book is quite good.  The biases are clear.<p>(<a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Real-Toy-Story-Consumers/dp/0552774065/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Real-Toy-Story-Consumers/dp/0552...</a>)",1337428742

Smart people, like the very attractive, get special treatment they do not know they are getting.<p>I think this is the most impactful part, could you elaborate? Describe a few of those experiences? People talk a lot about privilege, how taller people make more money for no apparent reason, how good looking people are treated better, particularly women, but IMHO it's intelligence that gives one the biggest boost in (non-romantic) relations with others in today's society.<p>Sure, there's an awkward geek who doesn't get as much as they could with their IQ scores but if you're relatively intelligent, and especially if you're also talkative, you can see the attitudes of people (from the cable guy and cashier at the store to course instructors and priests) changing in real time as your sentences get longer and not corrupted with filling words, as you with drop a few two-dollar words or describe an even relatively simple physics mechanism.<p>Their eyes light up.

I don't think a moral act becomes immoral because it is done to a person from a particular demographic.<p>""Cultural mindset"" isn't an action, it's a concept that lives at an abstraction level well above morality. What specific action is being taken that you believe is immoral?<p>It's hard for me to see how the moral principle that men and women are equal [1] is being violated here. Any child is free to play with any lego (as the article demonstrates) and the company selling them has no control over what the children do 18 years later or even what toy they use now.<p>[1] I assume you mean equality under the law. But if you mean some different sort of equality it would help to state which.<p>[edit: not sure why you are being downmodded. I don't think your explanation was complete, but it's certainly helpful.]",1337426087

You have to work there for at least a year (keep your pay stubs, they are required proof). They have to demonstrate they could not find the talent locally, newspaper ad and a couple interviews...<p>For investments, I don't know if 1M USD is required, but, I saw in the news some gov or cities considering to use foreign investors to finance local projects and they'll be able to obtain green cards (Tampa Bay Rays new stadium for example) but I don't think they are doing it yet, or maybe it was just more politicians blabbering in the medias...<p>[update] decide wisely, a visa tied to a company means you can't work anywhere else... You quit, your arse is back on a plane... Which means it is often used to secure cheaper talents that are stuck w the company, of course there are ways (h1B transfer to another company) but they are difficult to achieve...<p>Good luck!",1337425903

I know, this line of reasoning is not popular among the gender studies-infested crowd, but it's just biology. There are dolls because girls like to play with dolls, and not because we force them to play with them. There are differences between male and female brains, and this is why they prefer different activities. Read up on science before making your absurd statements.<p>Yes, girls and boys can grow up to become whoever they like, but most girls just don't like technology, just as most guys have little interest in playing with dolls.

If country A has a high crime subpopulation and country B does not, it&#x27;s a little silly to point to a policy in country B and blame the high crime in country A on the lack of that policy.<p>I&#x27;m simply rejecting the idea that differences in crime rates between the US and Scandinavia are due solely to policy.

In an ordered keyvalue store, you can do an efficient lookup of some time span.  Some dbs like FoundationDB provide a framework to manage key space using tuples, so it&#x27;s even easier to tailor and manage different key types to get the desired access speeds.<p>Rocksdb, a leveldb variant which is the engine beneath CockroachDB, does have TTL [3].<p>[1] <a href=""http://cockroachdb.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cockroachdb.org</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/11k2EmhLGSbViBvi6_zFEiKzuXxYF49ZuuDJLe6O8gBU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/document/d/11k2EmhLGSbViBvi6_zFEiKzu...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Time-to-Live"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Time-to-Live</a>",1411213644

See files using the &#x27;.right&#x27; extenion [0].<p>I think it&#x27;s a flexible approach, compared to using things as shunit, or TAP producers.<p>The main advantage of using shunit (or TAP producers too), I think is to re-use available tools (at least in the case of TAP producers), and the possible familiarity of new contributors with the syntax.<p>Personally I avoid test libraries that use traps and eval, and bash code can become so complex, that I thing there is not a single testing library (Written in bash) that could work with all my code base.<p>As soon as you start using advanced features (shell options, traps, code tracing features, readonly stuff, filedescriptors, etc) most assumptions become wrong.<p>Anyway, the most hard part of test complex shell programs (specially those related to system administration), is to test functionality.<p>It&#x27;s easy (and even not useful) to assert that &#x27;myecho 1&#x27; will print &#x27;1&#x27; and return 0.<p>But things become hard to test when you want to see if a partition routine works well with +2TB disks, if a netfilter ruleset is resilient to attacks (unknown by the author), if a program is safe to unexpected (by the programmer) input, if a backup restore will not break production...<p>Fun to see this on hackernews front page.

Adding sporadic side-effects to some component (1) will not force the rest of your program interacting with it into some monad. I guess there&#x27;s a reason they didn&#x27;t use Haskell :P<p>(1) For example, you want to compute on-line summary statistics, where the input is run-time configurable, i.e., items can come from a file, network or memory stream.",1411211237

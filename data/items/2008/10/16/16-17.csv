I'm seeing the same design patterns and philosophies of event-driven programming in recent toolkits and frameworks, even in places where languages like Java and C# are dominant.  The drift away from imperative programming to more object-oriented and functional paradigms (sorry) is even showing up in unexpected places, like how jQuery made JavaScript take on OOP and functional aspects in coding style.<p>It's a learning curve <i>everyone</i> will have to traverse, since, in the future, heavy parallelism and capped clock speeds of future computer systems will more heavily favor such ""modern"" design techniques (a misnomer, since the concepts have been around for decades).

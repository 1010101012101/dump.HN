Sounds risky to me; it's pretty much a public statement that the gvernment won't at all seek to defend the value of the dollar so I'm not sure why anyone would want to accept such a risky asset.<p>Two, each merchant has to manage things in multiple currencies in parallel, along with the tax offices having to do the same and keep track of relative values and when the payment came in to establish the correct rates of tax. Won't happen.<p>Three, the market sees an unsupported national currency with little or no base backing and no national reserve bank backing it up. That's pretty much a guaranteed recipe for hyperinflation and flight to assets (remember,  the historic result of not having the Federal Reserve was high inflation - it's been tried). It won't be orderly; the price of gold will rise fast due to demand against a basket of currencies, let alone against the dollar that'll be collapsing even faster. The banks aren't set up to handle physical deposits of gold, the merchants aren't set up to handle transactions in them so we'd end up with multiple, incompatible, payment systems based off private gold-measured currencies. Meanwhile industrial use of gold becomes prohibitively expensive putting brakes on the economy, while the fixed money supply inherent in a commodity-based currency puts us deliberately back into the situation that crashed the markets in 07-08 - no-one can get any credit to work with, so the economy ground to a halt. That was able to be mitigated by quantitative easing temporarily creating new money and injecting it into the economy, but under a commodity-backed economy that becomes impossible. Have a read of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard</a> if you want; I'm not alone in holding these views.<p>There's a reason why the Federal Reserve was created in 1913 and why the US ended convertibility with gold in 1971. Ron Paul seems to appreciate the lessons of neither, and I don't wish to live through him reminding the world of them again. Which is why, reluctantly, I think even Michelle Bachman would be a better candidate than Ron Paul.",1325350710

3411232,comment,3407643,3407643,0,0,benawabe896,,,"For me, I was only able to learn through experience, but hopefully my experiences can help you avoid my mistakes.  My first lead opportunity at my first company was about 2 years in.  It was a 12 or so person company, and all positions were flat except for the owner.  When I was promoted, I considered my new main goal in life was to improve efficiency.  While true to a point, I decided that the way I was to improve efficiency was to start tracking every piece of work performed.  I created elaborate tools to allow everyone to check-in their time, and built amazing executive reports to interpret this data.  However, efficiency (or rather actual work being done) was dropping.  Identifying this as a failure on the team's part, over the period of a year, I implemented a series of changes ranging from good cop stuff (take the guys out for team-building) to bad cop stuff (threaten pay-cuts, firings etc..)<p>Later at a new company, the opportunity presented itself, and I was sure I had figured it out this time.  Around this same time, I was really into design patterns and diagramming.  In fact, I felt as though every problem in life could be distilled down to a pattern.  Every member of my team could fit into nice little diagrams as boxes, and the work would get done like magic.  A designer was a designer, and programmer was a programmer.  Everyone and everything was interchangeable.  We could outsource work when we needed it, and get rid of people when we didn't.<p>A bit later at a different company, I was able to give leading a third try.  Around this time, I was reading a lot of joelonsoftware, and randsinrepose.  Instead of implementing anything, I decided to just try to eliminate obstacles for my team.  I started weekly 1 on 1 meetings with my guys, allowing them to talk about anything they wanted for as long as needed.  Lastly, I just tried to be the guy that I wanted my guys to be.  I made a conscious effort to keep my morale up, not let things get to me, and lead by example.<p>Looking back, I see that in the first two, I was trying to implement things that motivated me.  I love analytics and treating tasks as games.  I love seeing charts go upward.  However, management is about your people, not you.  People are emotional and complex.  This sounds pretty cliche as I write it, but try to improve yourself as a person, encourage that in your team, and the productivity / efficiency / whatever will take care of itself.<p>Good luck!",1325350567

3411225,comment,3410773,3410773,0,0,quesera,,,"As usual, I think 37S is mostly correct here, but they've omitted some crucially important qualifiers. I often wonder whether this is genuine myopia/naïveté, or whether they are crafting a subtext that serves their larger PR and marketing goals (i.e. obviously this can't work everywhere and in all cases, but look how close our realities are to our idealized case! Oh and by the way sign up for our services because they will solve your problems!).<p>Anyway, I've worked on and managed distributed teams, spread over 14hrs of timezones. What I've learned is:<p>You need good people. They need to take absolute responsibility for their work, and they need to be highly cooperative and reliably honest. They need to care.<p>You need the _right_ good people. They need to be professionally fulfilled by the high quality of their work as well as the team's work. They need enough adulthood or experience to do all the little things to compensate for the reduced bandwidth, like spending an extra 30 seconds on commit messages or ticket updates. They need to make the extra effort, sometimes.<p>They need to get their human quota of social interaction, status affirmation, deep bonding, etc elsewhere. They need to want to get stuff done at work and have another healthy center of life gravity somewhere else. It's probable and hopeful that the team will all become friends, but there's just too much drama and/or inefficiency if the team constitutes a member's whole social circle.<p>You need need a strong and coherent plan, especially around product vision and strategy. If things are still very fluxy or in-pivot, and you need everyone to be highly cooperatively creative, then there's no substitute for getting everyone together and eliminating all of the communications friction and overhead. Once the plan is internalized, you can disperse. Minor perturbations can be handled remotely. Major ones suggest reconvention.<p>You need good leadership. This can be de facto or even cooperative, but someone needs to take organizational and facilitating roles, and the rest of the team needs to have a focal point. Obviously if you are a team under some umbrella of org chart, this needs to be the titular manager, and he or she has to manage upwardly even more actively than within.<p>...<p>The absolute hardest part is hiring those good, right people. The technology is 100% there (and I think the 37S suite is OK but generally end up falling back to lighter weight options).<p>Remote work attracts the highly professional and the highly useless. If you're hiring people without a trusted recommendation, differentiating between the two can be difficult. You're looking for people who are talented and scrupulously honest, especially about weaknesses. People who are lying to you are often lying to themselves, and people who are lying to themselves are always lying to you. There's no place for that in a distributed team.<p>It's very important to cut quickly when you fail with a hire. There's no shame in not being the right person for a job, but it's the hiring manager's duty to take improvement very very seriously. The highly professional <i>will not tolerate</i> bad teammates under these special-needs circumstances, nor the bad management that permits them.<p>When remote teams fail, it's because management and hiring have failed. It's not so much harder as different -- but different is hard, for some styles of managers.",1325350302

I'm not suggesting that we should do away with them completely :-)<p>In the past (i.e. prior to what we sometimes call ""the information age"") it was a perfectly reasonable thing to have a very tall pyramid shaped hierarchy within a company. This was because the people at the bottom of the hierarchy needed to be told what to do and how - i.e. the manager was the ""expert"" at some task.<p>Nowadays people at the bottom of the hierarchy (especially in technology) tend to know exactly how to do their jobs - in fact they know much more than their manager about their own specialty. This has led (in savvy organisations, at least) to much flatter hierarchies.<p>> Do you need some managers? How many per worker is optimal?<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Span_of_control"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Span_of_control</a><p>""In the hierarchical business organization of some time in the past it was not uncommon to see average spans of 1 to 4 or even less. That is, one manager supervised four employees on average. In the 1980s corporate leaders flattened many organizational structures causing average spans to move closer to 1 to 10. That was made possible primarily by the development of inexpensive information technology. As information technology was developed capable of easing many middle manager tasks – tasks like collecting, manipulating and presenting operational information – upper managers found they could hire fewer middle managers to do more work managing more subordinates for less money.""",1325350275

3411212,comment,3410773,3410773,0,0,spiredigital,,,"A few takeaways from what I've learned after 4 years of experimentation with outsourcing / hiring remotely in my own full-time online business:<p>- Turnover can be a problem.  I went through 3 part-time workers in the course of 6 months because they moved on to bigger, better projects.  The hourly rate was great, but the re-training and inconvenience was a nightmare.  When my third iterations employee for the position ended up being a rock-star, I worked HARD to make her feel like part of the team, encourage her, and gave occasional bonuses even though she was an hourly, outsourced worked.  She's been with me for 2.5 years.<p>-  Hiring full-time, salaried employees in your time zone is EXPENSIVE, but eventually necessary in you want to free-up your time, grow the business and maintain quality.  For a while, I really put off hiring a full-time operations manager, instead trying to work with professional, part-time remotes in a time zone 7 hours ahead.  I saved a little money but dealt with tons of logistical problems.  If your employees are solely building a product, this might not be an issue.  But if they have any time of consistant employee communication, time zone shifts can get complicated.<p>I finally bit the bullet and hired a full-time, local operations manager despite the expense...   ...and it has been worth it. I was able to interview face-to-face, which I think is important for critical positions, and ended up with a guy who I 100% trust with the operations of my company.  I spent 7 months last year traveling internationally, and was often out-of-touch and 12+ hours ahead of my business and customers.  Without a local, full-time employee to manage the business for me that I trusted, there's no way I could have done that.  I possibly could have found someone remotely to do this, but I would have had to spend a LOT of face time with them for training, and to feel comfortable at a level where I'd leave for an extended period.<p>In summary, I've found a combination of remote and local employees really works best.  Remote outsourcing offers a LOT of great talent and potential, but it's no panacea; there are plenty of logistical issues to be considered.  But with the right planning and local/remote diversification, it can be a great tool for growing your business.",1325350048

Terrorists attack the United States with a hijacked aeroplane, so they ramp up security in airports - and mainly <i>in</i> the airports. The hijackers were passengers, so they focus their attention on the passengers, and the passengers only. The target was American buildings by means of hijacked aeroplanes, so they focus their attention on who and what goes on the plane - not what may happen in a crowded airport itself. A nutty attacker hides a bomb in his shoes, later his underwear, so we have to take off our shoes and get patted down or x-ray scanned respectively.<p>These are people trying to catch the specific perpetrators of yesterday, as if they had a time machine and could go back and stop that individual, not people who are trying to get to the root of the problem and deal with it. When governments impose taxes on optical media, because they ""help"" people pirate music, they might as well tax shoes and underwear while they are at it. When external hard drives came into vogue, NAS's in particular, Western Digital blacklisted media extensions like .mp3, because that would facilitate piracy; whether the government, lobby groups or they themselves came up with this I don't know. In this digital web age, people have moved their attention from physical media to digital media online, and now ""the internet"" is the complicit perpetrator.<p>The good and bad news is that this is a general error in people's line of thought, and it is a good thing that this is a problem that you don't have to be a geek to understand nor care about, because it will affect you whenever you travel, have a darker skin than most people, or use the internet. You can bury your head in the sand, but this will and does affect every person in the Western world you can imagine. Blame the media groups, blame the TSA, but most of all, recognize that we can't just focus our attention at the proverbial shoes and underwear, but have to grasp the scope of the root problem at the core of this, and how people soon enough will find something other to try to regulate and police to no effect and benefit for us all.

When it comes to convincing people, the person or team on the scene has a built-in advantage over the disembodied person on the phone or the net. This is just human nature. Monkeys gotta monkey.<p>Yes, yes, it used to be that the person on the scene had a much bigger advantage, and now thanks to our awesome telepresence technology the advantage is smaller than it used to be. Whatever. The advantage is still there. Blame time zones, blame the limited field-of-view of cameras, blame subtle sounds that only locals can hear, blame the fact that it's easier to establish rapport by talking about the weather when everyone <i>is experiencing the same weather</i>, blame out-of-band signaling of every sort, from sharing the same pizza at lunch to sharing the same hallways and parking lots to sharing the same air.<p>You can fight this by deliberately leveling the playing field: Force everyone to be remote most of the time, from day one. 37signals built their company this way. (And they also attracted and hired excellent writers; that's not a coincidence.) But if you don't foster that culture from day one it is <i>hard</i> to bolt on after the fact. Particularly because the culture of written communication and the level of writing skill needed to make remote interaction work doesn't arise overnight and doesn't grow on trees. You need to <i>practice</i> being an effective distributed organization.<p>And the problems with being remote won't always be obvious - indeed, as I said up front, the code may well be better, because offices are such unproductive workspaces. But the problems will arise when politics arise, as they do in any group larger than a given size. It will be harder to move up or around in the organization. It will be harder to sell ideas to co-workers from other departments, the ones who don't work with you everyday, because the social grooming is so difficult.<p>It's not just because of tax law that most remote workers tend to be contractors, and that so many contractors dream of starting small product businesses. The culture of business-to-business contracting is better adapted to working in writing and over distances, because there's several hundred years of cultural experience to draw upon: We have contracts, we have lawyers, we put stuff in writing. Selling a product to someone through the mail is even more formalized: People expect to read brochures, to get the product in a circumscribed package, to sign a contract and pay by the hour before putting in a tech support ticket. Contrast all this with the employee-employee relationship, which tends to be egalitarian and communal and rely a lot on subtle mutual teambuilding and backscratching that are difficult to virtualize.",1325348920

The algorithm is run on the entire code base, so now is a perfectly normal spot to go with. It didn't occur to me that really what now represents is ""last time of changes"". This is a good spot, and I'll put it in the paper I'm writing! Thanks!<p>A reasonable/desirable modification is probably for now to be changed to represent the last change, just like the first change is when the normalization window begins. (0 = time of first change, 1  = time of last change).<p>HTH.",1325348037

Assuming large companies continue to exist, how do you run one without managers?<p>If your company is 1000 people do have 10 executives and 990 engineers, customer support, etc. and no managers at all? How does everyone communicate? How do the executives delegate?<p>Do you need some managers? How many per worker is optimal?<p>It seems like every large corporation in existence has managers. I can't think of any exceptions. So I'm not sure what an alternative would even look like. Perhaps rotating temporary management structured like jury duty?<p>I'll probably be downvoted because bashing management is a time honored hacker pastime... But I really am curious. Is it possible to do away with management? Is it desirable?",1325347830

First with UEFI, then with the Windows 8 store where they'll only let you install apps from the market in ""tile mode"" and they'll even be able to remove apps from your PC. I know they still allow you to do everything in the non-tile mode now, but what happens when they remove that mode in the future?<p>How long will it be until RIAA tells Congress that ""Microsoft is not doing enough to stop piracy (even though they have the capability)"", just like they are doing now with Google, and then gets them to remove ""unlicensed"" songs from your PC?<p>I think stores are fine. They are a pretty good way to show you the best apps for the platform, and they also help a bit with safety, but they should still allow you to download and install whatever you want from the Internet if you choose to.<p>Android has a pretty good model here. They have the Market, and then if you really want to, you can get apps from other sources, too. Although, I don't think they should even ask you if you want to ""enable 3rd party sources"" in Settings. It should be enabled by default, and maybe just give you a warning whenever you want to download a 3rd party app, just like they do in Chrome.<p>The point is I don't want to lose any of the freedoms of what I can do with my computer, just for the sake of having a store that streamlines app discovery and makes me safer when I use it.

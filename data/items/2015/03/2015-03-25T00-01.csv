The whole fear mongering topic seems rooted in a tower of speculations that becomes increasingly precarious as you ascend.<p>Agreed.<p>> ... I realized that these fears might be rooted in the fear of <i>disruption</i>.<p>Yes, that might be part of it.<p>Another part is that ideas that are both <i>interesting</i> and <i>plausible</i> tend to be more visible. Lots of people will pay to hear Ray Kurzweil speak about how the next 20 years are going to be absolutely amazing. Not so many want to hear you or me saying, &quot;Well, maybe not.&quot;<p>Ideas like those of RK have always been interesting. In 1960, when a computer was a mysterious machine in the back room, surrounded by white-coated technicians (and even they weren&#x27;t too sure what it could do), such ideas were plausible, too. In 1990, when a computer was a machine for typing letters or playing lousy games -- not so much. But today we all have a box in our pocket that responds to voice commands, and we hear about self-driving cars. So this amazing future becomes plausible again.<p>This combination of interest and plausibility means we hear a lot more about the possibilities of strong AI than arguments against them. Even your own post contains 2 links for, and just 1 against. And guess which ones will be spread. No one says, &quot;Hey! I just read this cool article about how computers aren&#x27;t going to become intelligent any time soon!&quot; So despite the relatively easy arguments against the radical futurists, the people making them are not heard much.<p>> Interesting food for thought, don&#x27;t you think?<p>Indeed.

This is all a businessperson&#x27;s approach to analyzing this situation.<p>Looking at it from a technical perspective: there are two kinds of companies out there. There are companies that do something people care about and ones that don&#x27;t.<p>Think about Twitter for a second. If Twitter dropped off the face of the earth, would you really care? I wouldn&#x27;t. Even if I used Twitter, it wouldn&#x27;t be hard to just go find all the same people on Facebook or whatever and follow them there. People and companies use Twitter for self-promotion, but that puts Twitter into the same business demographic as a TV channel that runs infomercials. Some people watch infomercials, but if the entire infomercial market disappeared, nobody would really care. The problem with Twitter isn&#x27;t that they can&#x27;t monetize their product, it&#x27;s that they don&#x27;t have a product.<p>Then there are companies that actually have a product.

Uber and AirBNB charge for their products.<p>Duolingo doesn&#x27;t charge language learners, but they probably could: my experience is that they are more effective for language learning than Pimsleur, which a lot of people pay for. It&#x27;s an artifact of the Google age that companies don&#x27;t actually charge for their product, but charge for ancilliary services around it.

Rational basis for &quot;fear of AI&quot; is actually quite simple - a mind is a strong optimization system; if we somehow create one that is as powerful as our own, there is no reason to assume it will automagically share our values - and any strong optimization that does not share our values (note: we don&#x27;t really know what they are anyway) will most likely destroy us.

You have rules which take inputs, run actions, produce outputs and memoize them. If inputs don&#x27;t change, then you use memoized outputs and don&#x27;t run the action.<p>As long as your actions produce observable side effects in the outputs (and don&#x27;t produce side effects which are not part of the outputs, but product state which depended upon in some manner), then you can do a lot of optimizations on this graph.<p>In my experience with maven and gradle, they are way way slower, and that&#x27;s on relatively small projects",1427244013

Things like Bezier curves are defined mathematically, so you can represent the way a tiger looks in a, albeit large, mathematical equation! But due to their usage of maths that computers aren&#x27;t fast at performing, they are extremely difficult to rasterize in real-time.<p>NVidia&#x27;s technology to do this has been around for years, but it hasn&#x27;t &#x27;taken off&#x27;, I&#x27;ve yet to see anyone use it (maybe Adobe Illustrator uses it?). Khronos (the group who created OpenGL) even has a standard for accelerated vector graphics, called OpenVG, which has also been around for years as well yet only the Raspberry Pi and a few other embedded ARM devices seem to support it.<p>My conclusion? Path rendering is insanely useful, but it&#x27;s very complex for both application developers (&quot;this is slow and hard&quot;) and artists alike (&quot;I hate these weird grabby-handles!&quot;). That complexity comes at a cost, and time after time we&#x27;ve been shown that complexity is often overpowered by simplicity even when it&#x27;s inferior (bitmap images).<p>I would like to see Quadratic (i.e. a bezier curve with just one control point) become popular due to their artistic simplicity as well as their easy relation to graphics hardware (a triangle with a simple GLSLfragment shader can render a quadratic bezier curve).<p>Perhaps quadratic bezier curves aren&#x27;t as mathematically pure (cannot represent circles &quot;perfectly&quot;) -- but they are artistically beautiful and, in my mind, just as useful as pixels are (in real-time applications). <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/i2RtE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/i2RtE</a>",1427243989

9260570,comment,9255305,9259451,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"React isn&#x27;t about breaking rules or disregarding best practices. It&#x27;s simply recognizing that other principles need to be applied for a certain type of application.<p>Those principles are in fact old, and originate in the desktop app. Every single desktop UI framework throughout history, from Xerox Star to Visual Basic to Swing to Delphi to Cocoa, has modeled the UI in terms of components (sometimes called controls or widgets) that can be contained within each other. Components are logically independent containers whose behaviour and rendering follow them around; drop a button onto a form, for example, and you get &quot;button behaviour&quot; without having to implement anything yourself. React follows this exact pattern.<p>The reason people are interested in &quot;breaking&quot; rules such as separation of style and markup is because those principles don&#x27;t apply well to this way of doing things. Components aren&#x27;t document markup to be styled, they&#x27;re views that need to draw themselves. You can devise various ways to continue using CSS to &quot;skin&quot; these components, but this is ultimately the enemy of a good component. It turns out that for components to be true containers, they have to have complete control over their own rendering, and inserting global CSS that cascades into a component tends to violate that boundary. In other words, the component _is_ presentation, and therefore a &quot;separation&quot; makes no sense because there isn&#x27;t much to separate.<p>You can debate the merit of modern single-page apps, but people are building them, and need the tools to do so. At the same time it&#x27;s clear that people (not just developers) want both the power of the web, and the power of desktop apps, and developers are now trying to discover how this hybridization — the appification of the web browser and the webification of the desktop — can be attained. React is probably just one step in the search for some better converging structure.<p>You criticize React a lot in this thread, but I can assure that it&#x27;s well thought and coherent. I&#x27;ve been a web developer for about 20 years, and this is the most productive and content I have been about working in a browser. I recommend trying it out.",1427243761

Until very recently, there was no hardware support for virtualizing the network buffers, which would mean emulating the network hardware in userspace. This would be very slow.<p>- Because even today, many devices don&#x27;t have the required hardware virtualization support. For example, many (most?) ARM devices. If you give direct DMA access, you might be allowing anyone to splatter whatever code they want across whatever memory they want.<p>- Without kernel arbitration of some sort, there&#x27;s no way to do load balancing across services, throttle, or firewall effectively.<p>- The kernel is designed to provide a uniform interface for all programs to the hardware. Putting networking in userspace gets rid of this abstraction, and means that every program has to be aware of the network hardware; software that works with file descriptors directly can&#x27;t use the same abstraction for files and network.<p>- Because there are no hardware limitations on the amount of multiplexing. I don&#x27;t remember how much muxing various hardware supports, but hardware has limits for this sort of thing.

Receiving insane severance has way more negative externalities than positive benefits.

That makes the situation fundamentally different from most bubbles.<p>I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;re wrong per se, because I think the way student loans are heading is almost bound to be problematic, I just can&#x27;t picture that bubble &quot;bursting&quot; like we usually think of it.<p>A couple outcomes I could think of would be a law making student loans dischargeable in bankruptcy again, a government bailout type program, or a law greatly reducing the availability of student loan debt. Any of those would have drastic consequences, but I&#x27;m still not sure it&#x27;d be right to call any of them a bursting bubble (except maybe the first).",1427241851

There is no sane way to frame &quot;1&quot; - 1 _unless you explicitly typecast the string to a number_, because you now have to reconcile it with what should be identical behavior for numeric types, like &quot;1&quot;+(-1), which guess what, yields &quot;1-1&quot; in javascript, which is the definition of insane. You&#x27;ve also got to deal with other less obvious cases like when the string is a in a var and is not _always guaranteed to be a nice number_ etc, which really really makes ever using anything like that a code smell. It&#x27;s far easier for both the programmer and the interpreter _not_ to play the guessing game, and try and implement inconsistent numeric behavior, than to just say &quot;well I&#x27;m not going to do this unless you really insist (via an explicit cast) that you want this&quot;.",1427241850

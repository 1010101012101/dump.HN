547075,comment,547061,547061,0,0,cperciva,,,"This article should be subtitled ""How to lie with statistics"".  The author is comparing absolute numbers of bank failures over time, and completely ignoring the fact that not all bank failures have the same impact.  In particular, if a failed bank has 100 times as many customers, its failure will affect 100 times as many people -- and the failing banks of 2008/09 are much bigger than the failing thrifts of the 80s and 90s.",1238907391
547074,comment,546423,547037,0,0,briansmith,,,"It is not true that they ""only get their own tax money back"". A tax rebate would have that effect. I am not opposed to refunding people's tax money; I am opposed to giving them somebody else's tax money to support their religion. The voucher program is not a tax rebate because the people that stand to benefit most from the voucher program do not pay enough property taxes to cover the cost of private schools if they those property tax payments were refunded to them.<p>I never suggested that we force people to do anything. My whole argument is that we <i>shouldn't</i> force people to pay for religions they don't subscribe to.<p>I never said that the state should force parents to raise their kids secularly. What I said is that we shouldn't give them money to raise them religiously. I am not trying to impose my beliefs on anybody, and I am not asking anybody for money to help me impose my beliefs.<p>You keep trying to reframe my argument as anti-choise and anti-religion. It isn't the case. My argument is that the law should ensure that people should be able to choose <i>NOT</i> to support religious organizations they aren't members of, and we shouldn't take people's tax money and give it to religious organizations they oppose.<p>(I do believe that parents should give their kids a serious means of choosing their own religion. But, I didn't say the state should force them to do so.)",1238907041

547056,comment,546423,547010,0,0,jibiki,,,"I think the point you keep missing here is that all education is indoctrination.  Even teaching kids to think rationally is indoctrination in the rational method.  It's fine to say, ""I think we should indoctrinate kids only in rationality,"" but most people will disagree with you.  There is a sort of truce in our society: people don't hate each other for holding different viewpoints (as long as those viewpoints are societally acceptable, which varies from place to place.)  Part of this truce is that people are allowed to shape the beliefs of their own children.<p>You can't say ""we should never indoctrinate kids.""  That would be the same as saying ""we should never educate kids.""  You can say ""we should only tell kids the truth,"" but then, whose truth do we tell?  The problem is not so simple.  It's dishonest to say ""no indoctrination"" when what you mean is ""indoctrination should be more along my lines.""",1238905841
547055,comment,547016,547016,0,0,makecheck,,,"Mac, most definitely.<p>For one, Mac OS X comes with a Python version installed.  It also comes with a whole toolbox of Unix utilities, including a number of text editors.  (There are many other 3rd party text editors for the Mac, too.  Though I stick with ""vim"" or Xcode myself, both of which are included.)<p>You can't understate the value of being able to pop down to the Unix layer when needed.  There are lots of times where a simple ""grep"" or ""cp"" or ""mv"" is exactly what you need, and I love that this is just built in to the Mac.  If you aren't that familiar with Unix commands, I think it's knowledge well worth having; most of the basic ones are really not that hard to use.<p>I have to use Windows at work, and I have to say I'm amazed with how little it comes with.  While it is possible to work productively on Windows, I have found this is only true after a large setup cost.  So if you don't mind downloading stuff for hours, you can eventually get the right tools.  Still, I have never found Windows tools to be as ""integrated"" as Unix utilities are; every Windows program wants its own scripting language, its own hackish way of doing things (in my experience, that is; YMMV).  Microsoft's command prompt is also pretty lousy; it really doesn't compare to a Unix shell, and the idea that you could only get that level of power by installing all of Cygwin, is a turn-off to me.",1238905755

Grown-up Dutch people seem every bit as able to make up their own minds about what to believe as grown-up American people.

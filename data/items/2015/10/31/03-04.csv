That depends entirely on how the test results are presented, not the person or even the test. What&#x27;s half a human intellect? Is that being as smart as a dog? As smart as a drowsy person? Certainly not the difference between IQ 100 and IQ 50 because IQ is scaled so as to be normally distributed with 50 being almost impossible to achieve.<p>Even the linked paper (great that it&#x27;s linked and free access!) doesn&#x27;t appear to explain what the scores mean in its &quot;Cognitive Function Assessment&quot; section but identifies the test as using &quot;Strategic Management Simulation&quot; software.<p>So perhaps the conclusion should be &quot;stuffy offices reduce cognitive function by an unknown amount&quot;.",1446263939

10481718,comment,10479927,10479927,0,0,jqm,,,"I live on a couple of acres and there is no trash collection. We have to take all our trash into town.<p>I started composting a year or so ago. Not little barrels or bins or anything like that. I wanted to the compost to get hot and be able to really bury green kitchen wastes so animals didn&#x27;t pull it out. So every few months I have been buying a large (500-600 pound) bale of ruined moldy hay ($10 at a hay yard near here). I cut the strings and fluff the hay up with a pitchfork. Then I add a quart or so of fertilizer and wet it. Then I pile it into a cone and wet it again. The cones are about 5 feet tall initially with maybe a 5-6 foot diameter base. I keep my eyes open for any additional organic matter I can add. All the weeds, leaves, grass clippings... I even added some tall weeds I cut from the roadside this summer.<p>We bury anything compostable in the pile. All vegetable scraps, paper plates, paper towels, cardboard egg cartons, paper towel and toilet paper rolls, I even put in a couple of big (non-shiny) cardboard boxes that were completely consumed. About twice a month I turn the pile over. As the pile starts breaking down and shrinking to the point it doesn&#x27;t really heat up anymore I start another one. At the end I have a tiny little pile of compost maybe 2.5 feet cubed. It&#x27;s amazing how much all that stuff breaks down. It&#x27;s a lot of work but the compost is really great for the lawn and gardens. I couldn&#x27;t buy something of similar quality. I estimate it&#x27;s cut our trash by about 1/3 and importantly it also keeps most organic matter out of the trash which makes it less stinky (we don&#x27;t eat much meat and the dogs help with the scraps from the little we do). Composting is a lot of fun. It&#x27;s like farming microbes.",1446263116

I understand the risks, what&#x27;s inherently wrong with me investing with 10k other people?

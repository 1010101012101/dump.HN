Since you're still getting your feet wet, you should pick a language and stick with it for a little while, but don't stick with it as your only language forever. Too many people make the mistake of getting comfortable with one technology, and deeming themselves ""done"" learning anything else.<p>Start with Python, or Ruby, or Javascript. Something simple. If you're a fan of Windows, take a look at C# (which you say you've had a semester of already).<p>Start S M A L L. You say you try to build things that are over your head. Don't do that. Build things that are just about your level, while still providing a challenge. You're not going to come out of the gate with something like Kenneth Reitz' ""Requests"" framework. You're going to have years of learning and experience ahead of you before you can produce work like that (unless you're a prodigy, which almost none of us are).<p>Most importantly, do not give up. You are not stupid or incapable of programming if you hit a wall and can't seem to get by it. We all hit these walls, at every level of our craft. The issue is recognizing when you have the ability to climb the wall, to blow a hole through it, walk around it, or just go back the way you came and pick another path.<p>You could try applying for unpaid (or lightly paid) internships as more of a learning experience. If companies don't think you'll be a drain on resources, I would imagine certain companies would love to have someone who is eager to learn hanging around to take minor tasks and to be mentored for a few hours a week. The key there is finding the right company with that kind of time/support.<p>Best of luck.",1341579326

In the case of Chrome, for example, I would routinely test new work on web projects in <i>all</i> the major browsers. I am writing this with some empirical data in front of me, because I've just checked the bug tracking systems for a couple of projects I work on to be sure: for both projects, excluding mobile browsers, Chrome has been responsible for a clear majority of all defects where the root cause was found to be a browser bug over the past two years.<p><i>I don't doubt that there are bugs in Docs or Chrome, but they are relatively obscure.</i><p>Respectfully, if they were that obscure, my colleagues and I wouldn't keep running into them on multiple projects. I'd agree that the particular symptoms of any particular bug are usually a corner case: set this option to A and that option to B and it breaks, but other combinations work OK. It's the way that several of these bugs have recurring themes that betray both an underlying architectural weakness and a lack of effective quality control that I find most unfortunate.<p>Using Chrome as an example again, it is clearly aggressive with caching and conservative with repainting, but sometimes that means it is simply not behaving properly at all. If I set a part of the DOM to display instead of being hidden and then send an AJAX request, I want my ""please wait"" message displayed while the request is running, not afterwards, or indeed not at all since it probably gets hidden again as soon as the response arrives.<p><i>That's the nature of software, not every bug is caught by a unit test and users end up seeing them and reporting them.</i><p>And as I mentioned, several of those bugs in Chrome <i>had</i> been reported, and subsequently closed without the root cause ever being identified and fixed.<p><i>Expecting low-cost web apps to be as reliable as airplane control systems is unrealistic.</i><p>I don't expect Google's software to be as reliable as airplane control systems, but somewhere close to as reliable as everyone else's software would be nice. I appreciate that you're having trouble believing it or reconciling it with your own experience, and I've already acknowledged that my experience might be a complete outlier, but I'm looking at several years of <i>empirical data</i> across multiple completely different projects and development teams and it is quite clear that the Google products I'm looking at here haven't been keeping up lately.",1341578099

And the reason for this is that thread locals exposed are a very explicit thing compared to magic thread locals hidden somewhere in a framework.<p>The fact that you can do `_app_ctx_stack.top.mydatabase_connection` to get a database connection from anywhere is very helpful.  Frameworks that did not expose thread locals still have them.  Just special cased for certain things.<p>How does User.objects.all() get to the current transaction?  Correct: a thread local.  It's just hidden in the core of the framework.  Not having a thread local there is nearly impossible, especially if you need to work with foreign libraries that do not support passing in of information.  It's just going to cause a horrible API.  (Not for the view case, but for things like database connections)<p>Flask does not hide things from you.  It is very explicit, honest and upfront with everything it's doing.

Although the tags on the shelf mention the per-ounce price in addition to the full price, people will buy the twelve ounce can. Now maybe there are other reasons to over pay- don't want to open two cans later; 10 onces is too little, 15 ounces is too much.

I've been lurking here for sometime now and have seen similar posts, usually with positive and helpful responses. So decided to see if you guys could help me too.<p>So a little background about me. I'm 23 years old and been living in Scandinavia for 3 years now.<p>I'm not one of those guys that have been programming since they started walking. I started programming about 3 years ago when I started Electronic and computer engineering. There I learned Java for 1 year, one course per semester. After that year I found out that a strictly engineering-focused education wasn't for me and that I didn't even like hardware stuff anyway! So I rebooted my bachelor degree in a cross-disciplinary education which included all kinds of topics, ranging from 3D modeling to making sounds in Max/MSP with a lot of focus on academic reports (around 100 pages for one semester, which I hate btw) and user testing, and programming courses sprinkled in-between.<p>Therein lies the problem, since the education is cross-disciplinary, maybe one third to half of the students aren't very or at all interested in programming and as a result the quality and the challenge of the programming courses have suffered. Since starting that education they have taught ActionScript, C++ and C#, each on it's own semester and no-one is close to proficient in any of them.<p>I do realize that no-one should be responsible for my education except me, therefore I started learning Python on my own last summer. I've only really played around with it, not doing anything serious with it. Started one or two Django sites, finished neither since I was in over my head wanting to implement very complex ideas. I have made one rather complete script to download Google Docs folders contents and compiling them to LaTeX for my reports, but it's neither very complex or impressive. I'm very interested in web development and want to get better.<p>I do agree that you learn most my actually doing, actually coding something and I have tried to find open source projects to participate in, but I cant seem to get into any of them due to me not understanding the whole program. Maybe I just haven't found a small enough program to get my feet wet. I'm also not making much head way with Project-Euler either, usually getting stuck on some math stuff. I read a lot of tech and code blogs about webdev, Python and programming to keep upto date.<p>I tried getting a job at some local startups hoping to get the chance to learn from great coders but, of course, no-one was interested in my underdeveloped skills.<p>I do like programming and trying to find solutions to problems but I seem to lack both ideas of a manageable size (maybe that's an idea for a web site? Practice programming ideas, ranked by ""size"" and only provide hints and no solutions.) or the skills to implement those that do pop up in my head...<p>I look at someone like Kenneth Reitz and I think to myself that I would like to become like him some day but I have no idea how to get there. I also wonder if it is worth it staying in university when so many hackers seem to do fine with out the degree. And I would have take a Master's degree to get anything out of my education since it's so broad.<p>Does anyone have advice how I can improve myself? Or should I just find another field to try to make it in?<p>Sorry for the long post and thanks for reading it.",1341576471

They keep making superficially changes and marketing them as huge leaps. XP-->Windows 7 = some gui changes. I launch the system program and tada its exactly the same as it was in Windows 98. The most innovrative thing they've announced in a long time is locking down your install completely to prevent install of unsigned software. Apple makes new products. Google takes real risks to change the way things are done. Microsoft is way to risk averse for  the space they are trying to play in.<p>Step one to a good rebranding effort. Change what it is your selling. You can rebrand a turd as a chocolate lollipop and expect me to drop what I'm doing to rush to the candy store.",1341576247

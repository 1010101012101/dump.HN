Good one-on-one consulting (or anything, for that matter) requires you to be 24/7 thinking of your client and their problems, not yours. Perhaps other guys are better at multi-tasking among completely different things. To me, you've got to pour your heart and soul into it, or it's not worth doing. That's just the OCD-kinda guy I am :)<p>My biggest problem isn't the savings, it's the team. I chose to live in a really rural area, which is great for kicking back after getting off a jet from somewhere, but really sucks wind when it comes to meeting and forming teams. I'm waiting for one of these YC groups to help us hermit schmucks out with some good team-formation software. ",1189608780

Besides economies of scale there would be efficiencies in putting together people with common goals.<p>There's a reason so many startups form in grad student housing.<p>

53851,comment,53769,53769,0,0,FatBastard,,,"Larger numbers of women and perhaps gay men will reduce the incidence of violence in their communities. I also see a business opportunity. Marriage tourism. Internet sites and planeloads full of men from places like China and India, where female children are undervalued, should be easy to monetize. Its like global warming. In Saskatchewan we see nothing but upside.

53844,comment,53327,53505,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Since in my job I have to quote hourly and daily rates to people, I always keep in the back of my mind a rate for ""barely living"", a rate for ""swimming"", and a rate for ""comfortable living"". I'm always aware of the amount of money it takes to pay the mortgage, lights, car payment, etc.<p>That's the thing about getting married and having kids: it makes your life a lot more complicated. Personally I don't mind living out of an apartment and eating noodles for 3 or 4 months. I could even skip a couple months on the mortgage if I had to. But when they start taking away things your family needs to survive, like a house, then that's not eating steaks, that's starving. While I have no problem gambling my family's assets on my business, I don't feel it is morally right to actually lose everything they have.<p>Now if it was just me, that's a different story. At one point in my life, due to a fire when I was in my 20s, I lost everything I had. In a way, it's a totally liberating experience. Most people really don't need all that crap they surround themselves with every day.<p>That's why I replied to the article. I can see both sides of the story. Most young single guys don't need a lot of money (especially with Web applications) to make a go of it. The numbers get bigger with a wife, and they get even bigger with kids. That's not wanting Filet Mignons, that's just life.",1189605626

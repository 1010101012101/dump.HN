381175,comment,381099,381099,0,0,sdfx,,,"Most of existing on-demand stores for books, shoes etc. offer you only few choices. You can't really decide every detail of the product. The process of designing in a restriction free system can't be done by checking boxes and insering measurements. It has to be either a dialog between the designer and the producer or a detailed sewing pattern, together with drawings etc.<p>I think this idea is only limited scaleable - I presume it is not much cheaper to produce one unique item or 1000.<p>On the other hand, I could see something like threadless emerge for designs in general: They'd partner with ""real"" designers and produce small series of each piece and sell it until it's gone. Something in between etsy and threadless.",1228085709

The only reason I can think of for depending on these games to give you an advantage is that the tools (if any) dont have a lot of these ""combination"" features.  Or is this just more marketing?",1228085185

381162,comment,381099,381099,0,0,jfornear,,,"My friends and I have been looking into textiles lately to make our own designs for simple striped shirts. From what I've gathered, you need to first find a place that will make your fabric design, and then send the fabric to a place along with a pattern to have it turned into a shirt or whatever. I imagine the hardest part of clothing design is in finding cheap, quality suppliers and keeping a reliable relationship with them.",1228085014

381156,comment,380681,381064,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"First, I saw that you said that you have read Alan Kay, but I'm speaking to the general discussion audience. And, ok, you know what you're talking about; I'm used to reading people who think that <i>all</i> OO systems necessarily suffer from the same problems as e.g. C++'s, and, not knowing\nyour programming history, had few impressions to the contrary based strictly on what you said. Nothing personal. Be civil, have your coffee.<p>> What matters is how it works on complex problems.<p>Agreed. I don't believe pure-OO (or pure-FP, pure-declarative, etc.) is an ideal approach for <i>anything</i>. OOP is a technique that works well for <i>some problems</i>, and is best understood so you can use it when it is a good fit.<p>I think that the best way to <i>learn</i> OO is via studying Smalltalk. I think the best way to learn FP is via either Haskell or ML, etc. I do real work in OCaml, Lisp, and Python (though I am coming to prefer Lua over Python), but use a multi-paradigm approach based on what I've learned in other languages.",1228084342

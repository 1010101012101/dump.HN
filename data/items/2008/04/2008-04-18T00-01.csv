166848,comment,165935,166019,0,0,Tichy,,,"Reminds me how when searching for Linux fixes, it is never clear what version they apply for. They might describe some elaborate hacks that have been irrelevant for years, because there are easier ways in newer versions, but it is often impossible to know. I wish I could find only the answers that still apply to my version of Linux.",1208479992

166842,story,,,2,0,as,"Ask HN: Proto-hacker looking for a startup job",,"Hi,<p>I've always wanted to start my own company; discovering Paul's essays lead me to realize a web startup was something I was really interested in doing. I've begun teaching myself, but I'm not a programmer yet. pg suggests that the best way to learn ""would be to find some startup to hire you in an initially menial capacity, and start learning to program on the side."" This strikes me as a good idea. Also, I'd enjoy working in a company small enough that I can see the consequences of my actions and use them as feedback.<p>I've just had my 22nd birthday (April 5th) and have moved to the Bay Area to be at the center of the industry. I want the entire startup experience, so I'm willing to work at a feverish pitch to do anything that needs to be done. If you have a startup or can refer me to one, please comment or email me at arramsabeti@gmail.com<p>Thanks!",1208479185

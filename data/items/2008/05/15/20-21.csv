For example, I have several times weaned off coffee for a month. It was easy, too, but here I am, still drinking coffee (again). Since it is so easy to wean off it, I can just stop tomorrow, so why not have another cup today...?<p>Also, it seems that some schools ""addiction research"" only consider something a relapse if it happens after 6 months not taking the drugs. So anything below 6 months is not even considered as ""weaned off"".",1210882621

190875,comment,190295,190655,0,0,hugh,,,"I agree that ""why is Boston not in Oklahoma?"" is a question without a sensible answer, but that has nothing to do with the fact that it is of the form ""why does X not have property Y?""   You will notice that ""Why is Boston in Massachussetts?"" is not a question with a sensible answer either.<p>Similarly, ""why is your shirt not blue"" is a silly question, unless there's any reason to suppose that it might be. For instance, if you show up to my ""blue shirts only"" party wearing a non-blue shirt, it's a perfectly valid question.<p>Now, as for questions about ""Why is X not important for Y?"", these can have sensible answers. Why is aerodynamics not important for a lunar lander? Because it never flies through air. Why is peanut butter not important for a lunar lander? Now that <i>is</i> a silly question, because nobody would suppose it might be.<p>So a question like ""Why is speed not important in exploratory programming?"" should really have a sensible answer. You could, for instance, say something like ""Because in exploratory programming you typically only need to run short tests which don't take a lot of time anyway"". To which I'd reply ""Oh, I don't know about that, I typically run tests which take quite a long time"". To which you could say ""Oh, well I'm sure there are some cases where it is, but for most people most of the time it isn't"". And I'd say ""Yes, I agree with that statement"".",1210882494

The disadvantages are that meditation is much harder than taking a pill and the effects might not be as strong.

To maintain your dignity, focus on the work, not the politics.<p>2. Unfortunately quite common.<p>3. No.  Try not to dwell on it.  Pity them quietly, stay focused on the work, don&#x27;t lose yourself in their negativity.  Treat others as you&#x27;d have them treat you (even though they don&#x27;t yet), and lead by example.<p>If any consolation, you&#x27;re going through what I call &quot;celebrity training.&quot;  Since moving to LA, I&#x27;ve noticed particularly successful/famous people can be particularly difficult, demanding, and even insulting.<p>When you meet their assistants and see them graciously cope with their superiors being completely insulting, demeaning, abusive, awful human beings, it suddenly becomes clear: <i>That</i> is why you want to get to know the assistants.<p>It&#x27;s like they know how to speak a foreign language reserved for a special few- some of the most powerful, intelligent, successful people in the world.  They all speak verbal abuse.<p>Most people when they hear verbal abuse freeze in shock, do as instructed, feel embarrassed, explode in retaliation, or run.  But if you&#x27;re fluent in verbal abuse, you learn how to ignore it, see past it, even reform it, but most importantly, they learn how to work around it.<p>Also, keep in mind that a lot of your fellow bad-asses may have mild autism/aspbergers, which makes it hard for them to tell when they&#x27;re offending you.  If you get up in their face about their shitty behaviour, you might be surprised by their surprise.  They may not even be able to detect how much they&#x27;re upsetting you.<p>If you haven&#x27;t already given them feedback, then you should.  A simple &quot;Hey, it kinda stresses me out.  Maybe less of that?&quot; will do.  Remember to do it immediately after an infraction.  People are like dogs, and the sooner you interrupt and correct and throw it away, the more likely it&#x27;ll stick.  Also like dogs, people need gentle reminders, as they&#x27;ll keep slipping up for a while until it sticks.<p>Keep it light and funny, not dramatic.  Try a quick, soft-spoken &quot;rawr?&quot; with about the delivery and tone you&#x27;d use to say &quot;lip?&quot; while pointing out they have a suggestive dollop of sour cream on their upper lip at a house party, and you just want to bring attention to it very subtly for their benefit.<p>Also remember that an important part of training your dogs is to reward, not just punish.  While looking for infractions, you also want to look for spontaneous moments of good behaviour and thank them for it immediately, even with only a smile and a nod.<p>Best of luck!",1427413540

And definitely don&#x27;t bother with heavy drinking of any sort, in those years.<p>A lot of this has to with the observation being a student really is a 24x7 game, in those years (if you&#x27;ve chosen to go the student route, that is).  While I definitely wasn&#x27;t a &quot;grind&quot;, I have to say that the only reason I made through the system as far as I did was that, aside from a healthy amount of distraction (movies, shows; and parties for the sake of socialization -- <i>not</i> for the alcohol) I really was studying, or thinking about the content of my studies, <i>pretty much all the time</i>.  It was really all about being &quot;always on&quot; and intellectually focused, all the time.<p>And getting hammered on anything like a regular basis -- which is pretty much what the college drinking scene is like, these days -- really claws a huge chunk out of that dedicated focus.  I&#x27;m just not sure I would have made it that far if I had taken up the interest in casual drinking in my mid- to late 20s.<p>It also, BTW, claws a huge chunk out of your wallet.  $5 for a lager is nothing when you have a regular &quot;adult&quot; job, but (scaled up to rounds of 3-4 every few nights) it&#x27;s <i>a lot</i> when you&#x27;re on a student budget.  There&#x27;s only a certain period of your life when you can meaningfully benefit from the kind of ascetic detachment from the temptations and corruptions of a fat, &quot;adult&quot; paycheck. Later on, when you&#x27;re more or less forced to go the high-paycheck route, you can indulge in the comfort-distraction that goes with it.<p>This is the time of life when you should be getting intimate with the local university library; reading Feynman or GEB or any of the other books mentioned on the bus; learning to draw or to play an instrument (just to show yourself that you can); and spending your last dime on that Godot flick and, perchance, a can of tomato sauce to heat up in fleabag apartment you and 4 others share downtown.<p>But beer?

Others are also perfectly free to reject the proposal and continue to use the old meaning -- and to advocate for this, too. Only time will tell which group wins.<p>Just as words sometimes change meaning, there are many more cases where some people provisionally use a word with a new meaning, but this new meaning fails to take hold and vanishes.

I&#x27;m not particularly interested when there are other projects like TypeScript which also transpile to Javascript.<p>It&#x27;s also making me question the long-term viability of Golang, given Google&#x27;s history of shutting down projects abruptly.<p>Are any important teams inside Google using Golang for heavy-lifting?  At least Dart talked about the Google Ads team using Dart.  One of the goals behing Golang was go have C++ programmers move to the language, but instead it&#x27;s Python and Ruby programmers picking it up.  So if C++ Googlers aren&#x27;t using the language, it might imply that no critical systems are being built with Golang.<p>Also look at the resources that were initially put behind Dart.  Meanwhile look at Golang, after all these years there is no official IDE.  You would think that if Google were serious about Golang they would have put more resources into developing the ecosystem.

Please get counter-opinions for balance.<p>IMO only mugs and rich kids go to university in the UK now.<p>I doubt you&#x27;ll get working skills at uni. Depending on the course, you&#x27;re more likely to get mind-broadening introductions to CS ideas and techniques you&#x27;re not yet familiar with - hard stuff about algorithms, difficult languages you wouldn&#x27;t usually touch, and the like.<p>But you don&#x27;t get actual work experience unless you do a course with a one-year industrial placement.<p>At best you get solo and group practice projects you can maybe showcase to employers.<p>But - here&#x27;s the thing. With GitHub and StackOverflow you can get similar project experience working from home.<p>And academically, there is nothing at all you can learn on a CS course you can&#x27;t learn from books and the Internet. You may have to find and buy a few expensive books - but you&#x27;ll have to buy the books anyway.<p>Three years from now everyone else will be leaving uni with no practical job experience and three years of debt. You have the potential to have zero debt and one, two, or even three years of practical experience, having built a solid project portfolio that should at least get you on a shortlist for many jobs.<p>And if you&#x27;re interested in startups and business, you&#x27;re much better off getting into that as soon as you can.<p>Assumption - you&#x27;re fine with working hard. If you just want to sleep all day, this plan won&#x27;t work.<p>There are three downsides. One is that some tech jobs specifically demand a degree. Depending how stupid the company is, HR may specifically filter out non-degreed applicants.<p>That&#x27;s definitely a downside, but it&#x27;s only some employers,<p>Another is that uni gives you networking opportunities and personal friendships you won&#x27;t get at work. Some can last a lifetimem. They certainly have a personal value, and in the top-rank unis they have financial value too. (To be blunt about it.) <p>But if you&#x27;re applying to Average Uni of Middleshire I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;re worth three years of debt and the lack of cash later when you&#x27;re (e.g.) thinking about buying a house.<p>The final downside is that you have to look at the quality and location of the work you can get now. If you&#x27;re in London or a tech hub like Cambridge, it&#x27;s worth considering. Likewise Bristol, Leeds, Birmingham, Manchester, and so on.<p>Also, international remote. Well worth exploring.<p>Smaller towns - not so much. I&#x27;m sure there are small-town jobs with a future, but personally I&#x27;ve never seen one advertised anywhere.<p>So this only works if you have a realistic chance of a job with some prospects. If it&#x27;s a crappy timewasting job where you learn nothing and get paid peanuts - no.<p>Of course you have to avoid those later too. They don&#x27;t go away just because you have a degree...<p>tl;dr - if you decide you absolutely have to have a degree, you can always get one later. But the loan is a huge downside, and it can cripple your choices later.<p>It&#x27;s smart to at least think about avoiding it. If you decide in the end it&#x27;s worth the cost, you&#x27;ll be making a conscious decision, not just following the herd.<p>I&#x27;d keep applying, just because. But unless things have changed you&#x27;re not obligated to start a course until you sign up for one. So even if you get offers, you can look around for jobs for the next few months and not sign up for a course if you find something with prospects.",1427411992

In general Node supports long paths just fine (you can watch `npm` write past the 260 [wtf?] char limit). The limitation is in other programs trying to respect MAXPATH even when they should be moving to Unicode functions for compatibility reasons / lack of knowledge. It should be noted that compatibility breaks not just from long paths causing errors, but automatic file expansion does not occur on long paths. So we get into even more special snowflake situations where sometimes files with expansions work with older functions but not with newer ones.<p>But the fact that Unicode functions don&#x27;t expand adds an interesting problem for us; the MAXPATH respecting (and outdated) _A filesystem functions can cause a collision for non-expanded paths we get to fun things where you can have different FILE objects if you use old _A functions vs _W functions. The inverse is also true where you can collide by moving from _W to _A.<p>So!

It&#x27;s their choice. What problem? There&#x27;s no problem. If they want to eat less, they can. Barring brain damage or serious psychological disturbance, they&#x27;re human and humans are more than capable of deciding what to eat. It&#x27;s not &quot;fuck those people&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;they&#x27;re making a choice and it&#x27;s none of my business&quot;.<p>I do genuinely believe that. I wouldn&#x27;t even call it willpower. I&#x27;m not convinced any such thing really exists; people make choices. That&#x27;s all there is. I feel hungry, but I know I don&#x27;t actually need to eat this. Make a choice and in doing so pick how I&#x27;m going to feel; I can keep feeling hungry, or I can not keep feeling hungry, weighed up with factors and knowledge I possess.<p>My stance in the bigger thread is that the idea of deliberately removing nutritional content from food is grotesque. Sure, we in the rich world have never known hunger (not the kind you feel when you haven&#x27;t had anything with sugar in it for a few hours, but the kind that grinds people into dust over years and ends up with people selecting which of their family should die first), but it&#x27;s still a real thing and yes, sure, it&#x27;s just about free market economics and if the rich world can afford to deliberately destroy nutritional value to make life a little bit more convenient for themselves that&#x27;s just how international trade goes, but nonetheless it makes me sick. That&#x27;s what I feel is fucking grotesque; so much of humanity&#x27;s history has been a struggle to get enough food and famine was a perpetual real issue, and sure, this is modern times in the first world and now we can just destroy the calorie content of food for our own convenience, but still, what the fuck.<p>Addendum: <i>I have no idea why you would think people aren&#x27;t hungry just because they&#x27;re overweight.</i> Is that from what I said about some people not able to tell when they&#x27;re not hungry? I understand that&#x27;s a real medical issue some people have. Their body/brain doesn&#x27;t work right in that sense and when they&#x27;ve eaten enough, the hunger doesn&#x27;t fade as it should.",1427411230

It was fine when it was submitted, but now it is broken.<p>On Safari, every time I follow the link I get to the page the submitter intended--an interesting page, in English, about satellite tracking with not one hint of monetization (except a box with some weather information for the site&#x27;s location and a link to the service providing that...it&#x27;s possible that this counts as an ad).<p>On Chrome, however, I see what 0x0 seems to be seeing: the front page of online.nl, which is in Dutch. They appear to be an ISP, phone, and TV provider and the front page is trying to sell various plans.<p>I also see that on Safari if I hit refresh on the interesting satellite page.<p>On Firefox, I get the same result as on Chrome. All of these are on a Mac.<p>On Safari, I have AdBlock Plus, but I get the same behavior regardless of whether it is enabled or disabled or the site.<p>Asking for the link submitted here with curl gives this:<p><pre><code>   <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN&quot;>\n   <HTML><HEAD>\n   <TITLE>302 Found</TITLE>\n   </HEAD><BODY>\n   <H1>Found</H1>\n   The document has moved <A HREF=&quot;https://www.online.nl/403&quot;>here</A>.<P>\n   </BODY></HTML>\n</code></pre>\nI took a look with tcpdump at what is happening on Safari, and I see why I&#x27;m able to see the right page in Safari.

They have basic photo browsing, which is nice, but the Dropbox UX is orders of magnitude better at the time of writing.<p>Second, a lot of people use Dropbox to share files.  Amazon&#x27;s service is currently about back-ups. They&#x27;re somewhat different use cases, and <i>sharing</i> is arguably a harder problem than <i>backup</i> because the sharing experience must have much less friction to succeed.  So Dropbox is already years ahead of Amazon in this regard.<p>Third, storage at scale is still much cheaper than what anybody is charging.  A 4U of RAID 5 SATA drives costs quite a bit less than Amazon&#x27;s $59/yr/TB price point.  (I know Cloud Drive is &quot;unlimited&quot; at that price, but survey data suggest to me most users have less than 1TB of data or unwilling to upload that much).  While Dropbox purportedly uses S3 heavily, S3 is about $360/yr/TB.  Clearly Dropbox must have storage hedged with something else to back their Pro service (even if that tech is still under development).<p>Dropbox can, with high probability, meet Amazon&#x27;s offering here, and they&#x27;ll likely blow Amazon&#x27;s UX out of the park.",1427410823

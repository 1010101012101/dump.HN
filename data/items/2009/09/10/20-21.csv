This device does SSL in hardware, so it can do the offloading much faster and let the web servers and app servers worry about serving-up the app and doing that work.  Most SSL Accelerators can do millions of connections without working too hard, so it's possible at large scale for larger websites without really worrying about CPU on the server-side.  I'll bet that they just don't worry about SSL except for when it's absolutely necessary (personal info - login, purchase, ...).",1252616374

It doesn't specifically target engineering or science, so it wouldn't distort the market, and a Ph.D (I think Friedman included all doctoral degrees) from an accredited institution is sufficiently rigorous that I don't think it would be as easy to ""game"" the system.<p>But still, there are a lot of things I really don't like about this proposal as well.<p>My experience as a grad student in engineering at Berkeley has left me convinced that these programs are utterly abusive of their students.  If there's a shortage of Americans willing to sign up for PhD's in STEM fields, these institutions <i>deserve it</i>.  Plus, starting salaries for PhD's in science/engineering lag badly behind MBA/JD/MD programs.  This would only exacerbate the situation.  And if a Ph.D granting institution is able to award citizenship along with a PhD, there's pretty much no limit to the abusiveness they'll get away with.  Hey professors - Want to keep your highly trained poorly paid lab tech around for another year?  No problem - you control his dream of citizenship, so trust me, he'll keep working 80 hour weeks for you for $22K a year.<p>When this sets the standard for treatment of grad students, Americans will all but abandon the field.

816152,comment,815285,815678,0,0,jcl,,,"I think one of the big reasons for creating a new interface was that the XO's screen is really small -- it's about as wide as 1.5 times the largest dimension of an iPhone.  While its resolution is roughly the same as a standard desktop, its pixels-per-inch is 2-3 times as high.<p>This places screen real-estate at a premium...  Essentially all applications will be running maximized, so title bars and other window decorations are a waste of space, as is having a menu/launching bar at the top or bottom of the screen.<p>And due to the XO's high pixels-per-inch, all text needs to be roughly 2-3 times larger in pixels than on a traditional display.  Many applications on existing systems do not cope well with this requirement; most of the X11 applications that have been minimally ported to Sugar have text that is illegibly small.<p>The device's display is closer to a hand-held device than a typical laptop, so OLPC decided it needs a different UI than a typical laptop.  And OLPC is not the only organization to make this choice: There are a number of manufacturers who are releasing Android-powered netbooks in the near future, as opposed to using more traditional UIs.<p>Unfortunately, Android was not an option at the time the XO was being developed.  I imagine Maemo or Qtopia were not chosen for either licensing or maturity concerns.  Any of these options would probably have been an OK alternative to Sugar, but none of them is a traditional overlapping-windows interface.",1252615597

816143,comment,815975,815975,0,0,rms,,,">Carrell estimates that the human eye can directly resolve around 7 million pixels, almost twice the resolution of a 30"" display. But that's just what it's directly focusing on, all of the peripherial vision brings the total up to around 100 million pixels. The Eyefinity demo I showed earlier was running at 24.5 million pixels on a single GPU; you can estimate that at this generation we'll be able to do about 50 million pixels with two GPUs and one more generation from now we'll get to that 100 million pixel marker. That's two years for a single GPU. Then give it a few more years to be able to render that many pixels but with enough complexity to actually look real.<p>Rendering something at the max resolution that the human eye can resolve isn't enough however; you have to feel immersed in the graphics. That's where Eyefinity comes in, at least what it starts to come in.<p>Carrell believes that in seven years we can have the first generation Holodeck up and running. For those of you who aren't familiar with the Trek reference, Carrell believes it'll take seven years to be able to deliver a 180 degree hemispherical display (you're not completely surrounded by displays but at least your forward and peripheral vision is) with positionally accurate and phase accurate sound (both calculated by the GPU in real time). The GPU will also be used to recognize speech, track gestures and track eye movement/position.",1252615052

816136,comment,815681,815878,0,0,mdasen,,,"Apache/mod_wsgi creates multiple processes (or can).  The issue is that Facebook didn't tell us what configuration settings they used.  Did they limit the number of processes?  Did they not have it start up enough at the start?<p>It's clear that Facebook wasn't using a single Apache/mod_wsgi process because that wouldn't get close to 2,000 requests per second.  I'm sure they gave it the number of processes that were appropriate for the amount of RAM on the box - the issue is that every Apache process (of which I'm sure they dozens if not hundreds) uses up memory.<p>It's hard to set that up properly and that's what makes benchmarking so hard.  Still, it's not hard to believe that with the weight of Apache in the process, there's going to be at least 5MB of overhead for every request.  If you were saving that 5MB of RAM per client times the 2,223 requests per second, that's 11GB worth of freed RAM per second.  Let's say Django uses 10MB of RAM for a request: that's an extra 50% increase in capacity right there just by eliminating the 5MB Apache process overhead.  And Apache tends to be on the heavier side (5MB is somewhat low as an estimate) and if you can do it asynchronously, you're not tying up RAM as you wait for clients, so you do well.<p>Now, put Apache/mod_wsgi behind nginx (as a proxy) and you'll also see an increase in requests per second because you won't be tying up all that RAM as a client is downloading and only use the RAM while actually doing work in Python freeing that memory to be used elsewhere. However, I'm guessing that they ran this benchmark locally and so the network tying up Apache instances wasn't a factor.<p>Clearly, benchmarks are benchmarks, but it isn't as if Facebook and FriendFeed don't have lots of smart engineers and they wouldn't be using their own server if Apache was significantly better.  They have a site of massive scale and know how to benchmark things since you need objective data to make decisions based on rather than the religious arguments some get into.<p>I'd guess that, if one could get Django running under Tornado, it would run similarly and that it's more of Apache being the bottleneck/RAM hog.",1252614924

816111,comment,814990,815631,0,0,alaricsp,,,"Sorry about the bad grammar :-)<p>Ok, the deal with STP and VLANs is thus: STP works at the level of the actual Ethernet cables in the system, rather than the VLANs.<p>Imagine you have four switches, A B C and D. Say vlan 1 exists on A and B; vlan 2 on C and D, and vlan 3 on all four, and physical cables (carrying tagged VLANs) run from A-B (vlans 1 and 3), A-C (just vlan 3), B-D (just vlan 3), and C-D (vlans 2 and 3); eg, they're in a square. And you enable STP.<p>STP will cause the switches (<i>ignoring</i> VLANs) to choose one of those four cables to disable, to remove the cycle in the network. It's as likely to disable the A-B or C-D cables, which will then split vlan 1 or 3 in half.<p>The solution is to make all VLANs present on all switches and (tagged) on all inter-switch trunks, so that any cable can be disabled and connectivity continues; there are extensions to STP that are aware of VLANs (such as the Cisco proprietary per-VLAN spanning tree); there's the recent (2003?) Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP), but that's not supported by the switches I've been playing with, so useless to me at least :-)",1252614308

816105,comment,815528,815704,0,0,Kadin,,,"> However producers like this guy should work with the owners of the technology and negotiate a better deal.<p>You really think an independent film producer, hell, even all independent film producers as a group, have any negotiating power with the Blu-Ray licensing people?  Seriously?  If anything, the owners are deeply in bed with the big studios, who have a vested interest in keeping anybody but themselves <i>off</i> the platform.<p>I'm not sure why negotiation with and appeasement of the Blu-Ray people would be that productive.  Explaining to consumers why Blu-Ray, as a technology, <i>sucks</i>, and encouraging them to use something else -- which right now might be ""stick with DVDs"" -- so as not to give their money to Blu-Ray's owners, seems like perfectly a valid strategy, since it might result in something <i>better</i> than Blu-Ray down the road.  Working with Blu-Ray won't do that.<p>Blu-Ray may be the ""winner"" of the HD format war, but they're not gaining traction very fast.  If adoption can be slowed down enough -- if users can be convinced it's a shitty format run by a would-be cartel who want to crush independent cinema beneath punitive fees -- then it'll be that much easier for a new format to succeed.<p>Of course it's the economy more than anything that has slowed down Blu-Ray adoption, but I don't see how telling people about the weaknesses of the format and its backers is a bad thing.  The more people who know about it, the better, and the greater demand they'll be for an alternative (whether it's USB sticks, SD cards, or some form of online distribution).",1252614161

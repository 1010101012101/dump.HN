I have a hypothesis that early childhood traumas and violent environment can trigger the development of psychopathic tendencies, but I&#x27;m not entirely sure how much role does genetics play in this process.<p>Some of the commenters on this topic seem to ascribe superhuman rationality and brainpower to psychopaths. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a correct way to look at it. They can be very smart, but they suffer from the same set of biases and blind spots and Dunning-Kruger type of phenomena as other people. I think the defining characteristic is the complete lack of empathy and the willingness and ability to manipulate people (practicing the skill from early childhood, hence very good at it).<p>I was just looking up one of the smartest and most pronounced psychopaths I&#x27;ve met in recent years.

There are something like 500,000 software developers in the country. If fully half of Burning Man&#x27;s attendees were practicing software developers that would still only be 5% of all developers (of course, nowhere near half of Burning Man attendees are practicing software developers).<p>Meanwhile, 40% of Americans regularly attend church (FWIW: I am not one of them, though I am sort of idly Catholic). If developers were 1/4th as likely to regularly attend church as other Americans (a stretch, though it might not seem that way if all the developers you know are San Francisco twentysomethings, but I&#x27;ll stipulate that it&#x27;s possible) than, meeting a random software developer on the street, you are talking to someone who is <i>twice as likely to attend church as burning man</i>.",1387605431

One way is not talking directly about it but showing the correct way. That way the other person will see what you do and maybe will change voluntarily one she realizes that your method is superior. Another way is telling a story where the topic is touched indirectly, talking about another person and the results of her actions, but not as an example but as if trying to explain another topic.\nZ",1387605270

When giving or receiving criticism in a work environment, there is likely to be a rational response of equal or even greater importance.

EMC acquisitions just read like someone building a surveillance system: RSA, multiple deep packet inspection companies, enterprise clustered postgres, elitigation, forensics and threat analysis, Government-risk-analysis... and if you google around you&#x27;ll see they kept their investments as secret as they could.<p><a href=\"https://angel.co/emc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://angel.co/emc</a><p>EMC bought every single major corporate partner technology in 2009/2010. EMC is the private honeypot for the entire program. The corporate store is EMC and only EMC. EMC and EMC ventures can go to hell for building this, knowing about it, and continually profiting from it. Profit from investment in a partner of an illegal government program specifically designed to make illegal money from human rights violations should be considered illegal. All of the major money behind EMC knew what was going on. If you did a private benefit analysis, it would be all EMC. Thank you. =)",1387603301

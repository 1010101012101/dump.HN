6031171,comment,6030320,6031094,3,0,jnbiche,,,"Two e-mail replacements that aspire toward secure communication with little actionable metadata are Bitmessage and I2pbote (runs over i2p net).  Both are very much alpha, and Bitmessage has some significant work to do on how to scale up.  But both are also p2p, and both automatically encrypt and decrypt all messages by default.  If there are any other e-mail replacements that aspire toward security and anonymity, I&#x27;d love to hear about them.<p>I&#x27;m really interested in seeing one of the recently peer-reviewed secure, anonymous DHT e-mail systems (such as [1]) brought to life beyond an academic paper.  I think such systems are pretty promising (i2pbote is similar).<p>1. <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.2668"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.2668</a><p>EDIT:  It occurs to me that I don&#x27;t know enough about i2pbote to confidently call it &quot;alpha&quot; or &quot;beta&quot;.

Here&#x27;s the thing - MS Office is innovative and still the best at what it does. But it&#x27;s old and like anything old, it becomes a commodity.<p>Adobe Photoshop is also innovative and still the best at what it does (by far). The problem that Adobe has though is that many Photoshop licensees are not professionals and can be served just as well by cheaper or even free software. Companies like Adobe also benefited a lot from piracy, as a lot of people ended up using Photoshop, even though not that many people can afford it.<p>Also, what you&#x27;re seeing here unfolding with web apps is only the begging. In relative terms, the concept of a web app is still young. Even in early 2000, people had no idea that they can have apps running in their browser and broadband / 3G / 4G is still not a reality in many parts of this world. The combination of cheap and easily accessible on any platform, without any lock-in whatsoever, is extremely powerful. Couple this with devices that are designed to be portable and always connected and you&#x27;ve got a killer that will cannibalize everything else.<p>> <i>The reality of modern web and mobile software is that a lot of it is cheap, and it should be cheap, because it adds only a little value and it isn&#x27;t very hard to create it</i><p>Things like Google Docs / Google Calendar / Google Maps / Twitter / Wikipedia give me a hell of a lot more value than anything a desktop app could.

It&#x27;s your responsibility to make your decisions and your responsibility to examine the repercussions of those decisions, I understand that the concept of personal responsibility is completely alien to the vast majority of statist humans in existence, but that doesn&#x27;t stop it being the only path I am able to accept.<p>The knowingly or unknowingly bit gets slightly harder however since it&#x27;s not completely beyond the realm of imagination that you might trust a party with which you choose to do business to behave in accordance with your expectations and standards. However, the difference there is, once it becomes clear they&#x27;ve violated that trust, you retain the option to cease your dealings with them.<p>No matter how many times the state violates that trust, you do not acquire that option, your option is the same as it was to begin with, serve or die.",1373607431

6031094,comment,6030320,6030745,5,0,grey-area,,,"One really good thing about having lots of apps though is that it makes it harder for the NSA to subvert the apps or developers and develop attacks. If there are so many of them from around the world springing up all the time, that makes it a lot more difficult for any one national agency to control the space and become omniscient, and more difficult for them to develop attacks which will work globally.<p>If there is one thing I&#x27;d take from this NSA/GCHQ debacle it&#x27;s that encryption is the only way to stop numerous agencies from accessing the content of your communications and storing them indefinitely. They already want to store everything. If you encrypt they&#x27;ll have to decrypt first before parsing and your messages, and that&#x27;s impractical for them on a large scale. I&#x27;d love to see a replacement for email that used local encryption to send information completely encrypted (including metadata) from point to point, with no keys on the server, or perhaps no server at all.<p>Encryption is a way to keep things secret for some time, not forever, it won&#x27;t keep things safe forever <i>even if it is considered perfect at point of use</i>, as usually flaws are found in protocols eventually, and new ones adopted for that reason. Even if there is an established attack on a given chat program, agencies would have to take the time to attack and decrypt communications specifically, rather than just intercepting them at providers or with line taps. It would prevent a great deal of casual snooping and make things considerably more difficult. So the more protocols and apps the better I think.<p>In addition to this, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with people developing chat or encryption front-ends <i>as long as they use established encryption programs to do their actual encryption</i>. That should be the message that is given to people, not that they shouldn&#x27;t bother using encryption in their products at all, because they&#x27;re idiots and will get it wrong. Many will get it wrong, but some won&#x27;t. I wouldn&#x27;t trust this particular program (no source for a start), but other new entrants might be trustworthy. I don&#x27;t think there are enough apps in this space now, the more the merrier, and if some of them are broken, that doesn&#x27;t make it any harder to evaluate a good one if you are an expert in the field, and it will still make things more difficult for security agencies.<p>If you&#x27;re not an expert, you&#x27;ll have to rely on the opinions of people you respect about which programs are trustworthy. I&#x27;d love to hear Binney speak for example on which encryption methods he would trust nowadays, as he&#x27;s likely to have very good knowledge of which ones are harder to break. The most I&#x27;ve seen from him is that they are<p><i>&quot;on the verge of breaking a key encryption algorithm.&quot;</i><p>which just underlines that what is considered trustworthy today will not be tomorrow. So I think that security is a graded scale, not binary, and to insist that only experts should ever get involved with encryption just narrows the field to a small number of companies/experts that government agencies hostile to you can easily subvert.<p>PS Just seen downthread that you&#x27;re responsible for this app - <a href=""https://whispersystems.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://whispersystems.org/</a> Looks great and I&#x27;ll be trying it out when it comes to iOS.

As a company, we focus on open source enterprise engagements, mainly focused around the open source Java ecosystem:  JBoss, Tomcat, Activiti, Hadoop, and other technologies of that general nature.<p>2.

The product we are most focused on right now is an Enterprise Social Network named Quoddy.  Quoddy brings together aspects of Social Networking, BPM, Machine Learning. and the Semantic Web to that end.  Over time we plan to offer products in several areas, including Enterprise Search, BPM, &quot;Big Data&quot;, Business Intelligence / analytics, SOA / integration, etc., where everything fits into our vision of IT as a means to enhance the collective intelligence of the organization.<p>As the original founder, and one of only three people working on the project (counting an intern) I do a bit of  everything: writing code, developing product vision, writing marketing copy for the website, sales, customer development, strategy, market research, you name it.",1373607060

Then a guy I went to school with offered to sell me a dead 286 box that had a good power supply, videocard, floppy drives, etc., that I needed, so I bought that, and cobbled together this Frankenstein&#x27;s PC of a computer.  Got myself a 28.8 modem and start exploring BBS&#x27;s, Tymnet and Telenet networks, reading Phrack magazine, got into phone phreaking and other sordid activities...<p>Then somehow I got hold of a shareware C compiler, and a copy of Herbert Schildt&#x27;s book <i>Teach Yourself C</i>.

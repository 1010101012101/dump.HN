8730555,comment,8729421,8729421,0,0,LukaAl,,,"What do you mean for &quot;writing tools as powerful as those used by coders&quot;? In my experience good coders doesn&#x27;t need very powerful tool. Super-complex IDE are usually a disturbance to good coders rather then an help and even the uber-geeks that use Emacs don&#x27;t really use in their jobs all the macros.<p>A lot of good software engineer I know prefer lightweight editor like the good old Vim or SublimeText over IDE like Visual Studio, Xcode or Eclipse. That&#x27;s because when you write complex code your brain is slower than your finger and the syntax and structure of the language you are using is something under your skin, you don&#x27;t need to think at it.<p>So, no, great coder doesn&#x27;t use powerful editors, if they can chose they use very simple one with the minimum level of features they need to help them think faster (syntax highlighting, autocompletion, indention) and stop. All other features of complex IDE are a disturbance rather than an help.<p>I don&#x27;t know what a good journalist need but my guess is that they have the same problem, their brain is slower than their finger and the grammar of the language they are using should be well known. I don&#x27;t know which tool they use, but in my opinion a simple text editor with a minimal spellchecking system (but not correction) well integrated with the publishing process is more than enough.<p>From an Innovation point of view I&#x27;m usually suspect when someone claim to have an innovative tool for an established industry. If the industry is established the actors have already optimized their tools and if there could be an improvement is very small. What usually happens is that something changes in the industry and make the actual tool obsolete (e.g: a new process or a new technology became available). But if you want to create something really innovative, you have to find this change. Simply bringing something existing in a field in a different field rarely works. And if it works is because you have a really good understanding of both fields.",1418234003

But does this product not just add one more channel that they then have to deal with? Because I&#x27;m someone who has the problem you highlighted, I was nodding along with the video on your website. But then I realised it doesn&#x27;t solve my problem because it doesn&#x27;t reduce the number of existing channels I already deal with. It is actually changing my problem from n to n+1.<p>The Goowi platform looks to add value to businesses as opposed to individuals. And like your video says &quot;businesses aren&#x27;t people&quot; which means they don&#x27;t have pain points, they just have a profit margin. So if your product increases that profit margin by increasing sales sufficiently through perceived social responsibility then you&#x27;re looking at a viable customer base.<p>Things I&#x27;d point out though are that this platform is going to compete with existing loyalty schemes that put money back in peoples pocket as opposed to having them give it to a charity. For certain demographics the charity angle could work better than a loyalty scheme. With loyalty schemes the pay back is generally pretty low but consumers don&#x27;t mind because they get something free. The cash equivalent of this going to a charity might not seem like a whole lot of money under the cold light of day. Also as with loyalty schemes certain people (like me) dislike the lock-in nature and hassle of such schemes. I prefer companies that give back without making a song and dance about it or companies that are inherently socially responsible.<p>To bring it back to the video. I don&#x27;t think your helping Nicole, your just helping the business and Nicole is a means to an end. I&#x27;m not criticising that, I&#x27;m just saying that&#x27;s how I see it.<p>Finally, and I&#x27;m sure you given this thought, providing the platform as a white label product would look like the best course because Nicole needs to see Company X providing the money going to charities and not Goowi.",1418233351

Everything your database knows about that kind of thing is in that one table. If you want to know more than one kind of thing at a time, you create a new table automatically with a query.<p>Compare: Every function does one kind of thing. Everything your program knows about doing that kind of thing is in that function.

(There are valid arguments on both sides, and it&#x27;s really a judgement call you have to make for each specific application, but it seems like that&#x27;s been beaten to death here on HN.) I was specifically replying to your point about having the server generate all HTML changes, which I think is generally a bad idea.<p>> If you only need to make one update, such as a message post in a chat application, then you&#x27;re probably not saving a lot from a pure character count perspective.<p>Either way, the &quot;character count&quot; of the data being sent over the wire shouldn&#x27;t be an issue, and if it is, that&#x27;s an edge case and not the general rule. Saving a few bytes on each response is not why JSON is used for data exchange.<p>> I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by not waiting for a response from the server before updating the app, though I suspect it implies even more complexity (local storage, synchronization, out-of-band management of failures, etc).<p>That&#x27;s not what I meant at all. If the server is your templating engine, then you can&#x27;t update the UI until you get a response from the server. So that means, if I click to read the message in my chat application, the UI doesn&#x27;t acknowledge that it&#x27;s been read until I get a response from the server, which can be more than a full second in a high-latency environment. In something like React, I can instantly update the UI before the request even finishes.<p>Having said that, you make web apps seem trivial to develop. In practice (at least in my experience), many (most?) web apps <i>are</i> complex. I&#x27;ve been bitten too many times by projects that seemed &quot;too simple&quot; for a framework. If the web apps you&#x27;re building really are that simple, then I think your solution is great, but I think most of today&#x27;s rich web apps aren&#x27;t simple CRUD applications anymore.<p>> From a maintenance stand-point: $(&quot;.content&quot;).html(response) has had a very long shelf-life.<p>It&#x27;s also a pain in the ass to maintain. You have to imperatively define changes to your UI based on different events, which makes refactoring difficult and often leads to spaghetti code. There&#x27;s also the fact that you&#x27;d have to keep UI state on the server as well (if this menu is open, change this thing, else change this other thing), which opens a whole new can of worms.<p>> If I can summarize your point: Data-binding can simplify complex pages.<p>React actually doesn&#x27;t do data binding. The reason React is awesome is because it isolates different parts of your app and allows you to define the UI almost declaratively. Rather than keeping track of the current state of your application at all times, changes in state cause React to just (conceptually) re-render components. So your components essentially become pure functions that take state and render a UI. And for event handling and dispatch, check out [Flux](<a href=""http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2014/05/06/flux.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2014/05/06/flux.html</a>) if you haven&#x27;t already.

8730443,comment,8727026,8730249,0,0,aidenn0,,,"With proper dithering, lowering the bits raises the noise floor.  This is because dithering is approximately equal to changing the quantization error from something regular to something random.<p>If you don&#x27;t dither, then the quantization error will likely be something harmonic rather than the hiss you hear in that video.  This is much more noticeable[1].<p>Lowering the number of bits produces the same wave, but with more error.  Dithering ensures that the error is random noise, which is why you hear &quot;tape hiss&quot; in that video as the bits gets lowered.  With a tone frequency chosen to maximize the harmonic quantization error and no dithering you would start to hear it.<p>Lastly, 24 and 16 bit are largely unrelated to mp3s.  In practice, mp3s are decoded to 16 bit audio, but they don&#x27;t store the audio as PCM, but (roughly) rather as frequency/amplitude pairs which could in theory be decoded at any sample size.  In any event, the absolute magnitude of
error introduced by encoding a 128kbps mp3 is way, way, way larger than 16 bit quantization error, and the goal of the mp3 encoder is to find a way that is as inaudible as possible.<p>MP3 is an old format at this point, so it does have audible defects in some types of music at even the maximum bitrate (certain percussive instruments are an issue).  Vorbis and AAC work in some ways similar to mp3 but are strict improvements (though for the love of music, don&#x27;t use the FAAC decoder, it&#x27;s generally considered horrible).<p>1: Still not noticeable at 16-bit audio, as a similar test to the one in the article was done with no dithering on the 24 -> 16 bit conversion.  at somewhere between 12 to 14 bits it would start to be discernible.",1418232983

    doStuff :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int -> Int -> Foo 
</code></pre>
Of course that&#x27;s abstract: I meant &quot;you&quot; as a <i>programmer</i> dealing with these functions and the ints might well be a low index, a high index, and the neighborhood of a pivot index, so it&#x27;s called as:<p><pre><code>   doStuff lo hi (p - 1) p (p + 1)
</code></pre>
and of course you probably wouldn&#x27;t pass all three p&#x27;s in -- but those are definitely three different Ints which you may have to keep track of.<p>It sounds like your panacea here is to instead have the programmer write:<p><pre><code>    doStuff&#x27; :: Lo -> Hi -> Pminus -> Pivot -> Pplus -> Foo
</code></pre>
The problem is, that `f` still has type `Int -> Foo` and there is still this huge semantic error of providing the wrong argument to f. So no, if you actually explicate <i>what I said</i> you indeed find problems much like what I &quot;invent after the fact&quot;.<p>Are you saying that `f` should not have input type `Int`? That input type is isomorphically non-negotiable: you&#x27;re either going to write five `f` functions or you&#x27;re going to have type coercions, and both ways have the problem. I really don&#x27;t see anything you&#x27;ve said which alleviates it.<p>If none of what I was saying was what you thought I was saying, that&#x27;s OK, mistakes happen all the time.

Typically, both sum types and union types must be tagged. If you think about something like the JVM, every object is tagged with a pointer to it&#x27;s class. Untagged, or &quot;tagless&quot;, objects are closely related to &quot;unboxed&quot; objects, but still not quite the same thing. The point is that the tag is something that can be inspected, switched on, etc at runtime. Where as a tagless representation does not require that runtime overhead.<p>It&#x27;s possible to have a Union(int, String) or something like that where one type is typically untagged and the other typically tagged. If the compiler could eliminate the tag at runtime from context, then it would just eliminate the union and substitute the type with either int or String directly. So if it can&#x27;t tell from context, it must actually make it a Union(Box<int>, String) so it can discriminate by tag.<p>Tangential: There is of course a trade off in tagless representations in terms of type system complexity and runtime cost. If you want to change from a List<int> (specialized list of machine ints) to a List<Integer> (nullable boxed ints), that&#x27;s an O(N) operation to add the tags (and a more complex type system).",1418232681

8730242,comment,8729047,8729047,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"I&#x27;d like to see the inclusion of data related to the structure and dynamics of the family unit.  In the US the family desintegrates as kids are encouraged to leave home as soon as they finish high scool, say, 18 years of age.<p>This, in a huge number of cultures and countries around the world is an unthinkable attrocity.  It isn&#x27;t uncommon to have children live with their parents until they are ready to form their own families, say, 25 to 30 years of age.  Under the stereotypical US culture this is looked down upon to the point of making fun of those still living with their parents.<p>Having millions of socially unprepared kids go off to try to make it on their own created, in my opinion, a society filled with various levels of dysfunctionalities.  People tend to grow up, to some degree, in a &quot;wild&quot; setting where selfishness can become a necessity. In this context it is easy to see how work time can take the place of the social context lost due to having left the nest.<p>Having grown up and lived in three cultures it is easy for me to remove myself from my US culture and watch it from afar as a visitor from another planet might.  Americans are said to seem socially inept and dry from the perspective of other cultures, and this is true.  All you have to do is spend six months in Italy or Argentina to undrerstand this.  Americans men develop a weird homophobic form of &quot;macho&quot; that is down-right funny from the perspective of other cultures.  Hugging, or worst, kissing, another man is frowned upon.  Human contact, in general, is just not considered to be &quot;normal&quot;.  I have lived in cultures where it was quite normal to greet your kids parents with hugs and kisses on the cheeks.  In fact, it would be rude to come to a party or gathering and not go around the room kissing everyone, man, woman, kids.  Yes, you kiss your friend&#x27;s wives.  School friends do this in high school when they greet each other.  Again, unthinkable in the US.  In fact, a teacher can get in trouble with the law for greeting a student with a hug and a kiss. Showing affection is alien.  Weird.<p>In general terms, as much as TV shows and commercial try to stereotype this warm southern cowboy culture at the ranch with grandma this is, for the mist part, not the norm.  The US family scatters and the kids are left to navigate a very important phase of their lives on their own.<p>Sorry to harp on this but i do think this is a very important part of the equation and one that explains so much about US society, their behaviors, beliefs, relationships, work and family life. Once you realize that some of these people become politicians that shape US policies and laws it is easy to see where some of our problems might come from.<p>There are subtle examples of this.  For example, let&#x27;s say you are working with a US friend on a project in their garage.  He will use phrases like &quot;give me my hammer&quot; or &quot;it&#x27;s in my toolbox&quot;.  In other cultures this becomes &quot;give me the hammer&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s in the toolbox&quot;.  I am convinced this egocentric view of the world is connected to leaving the nest early.<p>Another example that is particularly bothersome to me are cases where parents pay their children for things that in what I am going to call more socially adjusted societies is simply unthinkable.  One of my friends pays his 18 year old kid to go pick him up at the airport.  Another pays his kids to help paint the house.  My neighbor across the street pays his kid to mow the lawn.  Viewed from far more family-centric cultures these woukd be examples of seriously dysfunctional family units.  As a teenager I helped my parents in their business. Money was never a part of it.  This is simply how a family behaves in other cultures.<p>Of course I am painting with a wide brush.  There are lots of cases of families that behave very differently from this.  And, of course, the US has lots of multicultural families, such as mine.  Yet I still think that a huge portion of the attitude towards work has to do with a bunch of single people existing &quot;in the wild&quot; and a setting where work can easily become a substitute for the family unit they effectively lost.",1418231314

Funny, because there&#x27;s actually a long, long history of debate around whether Rust should refer to them as unions rather than enums (and change the keyword correspondingly). :) Here&#x27;s the most recent one that I know of: <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/27"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/27</a><p>Swift seems to have followed Rust&#x27;s example with its terminology here, so this issue is hardly settled. It may shake out such that `enum` is used for tagged unions where the variants are declared as part of the type (`enum Foo { Bar, Baz}`) (and hence the variants can&#x27;t be shared between types, at least not without wrapping in a newly-defined variant), whereas `union` is used for tagged unions where the type is composed from multiple existing types (`type Bar; type Baz; union Foo { Bar | Baz }`).",1418231133

Travel insurance was required for our visas; we had trouble finding anyone to insure us because we weren&#x27;t finishing where we departed from.
Spending money was under what we budgeted.
The tour was obviously the big expense, doing it ourselves would have been a lot harder, but would have saved a lot of money, but then we&#x27;d have to have gone and lined up to get visas whereas they did that for us.

I believe somehow you would like to help my business to allow my customers to donate funds to charity through me somehow? As a business I would have a number of issues that would need to be addressed.<p>First, you name off quite a few statistics and have no sources cited for those statistics. You also post other big brand names in a quite large block under your youtube video player. Do these companies work with you? Are they onboard? I would guess they aren&#x27;t, or you wouldn&#x27;t be asking us to validate your startup; it would already be validated. Are these socially conscious companies? Maybe, but I don&#x27;t get it.<p>Second, as a business, I have no idea what I am signing up to do. Must I pledge a certain amount of money to any random cause my customer wants to put the money towards? Is there a tax advantage? Is there a liability on me because my donated business money does not go to an actual charity due to an error or omission? Many &quot;youth soccer teams&quot; take donations but are not tax exempt and the filing becomes and interesting problem. What if, as an organization, we don&#x27;t agree with every charity in the world and only want our donations to go to certain charities?<p>Third, what is your part and benefit in this? Are you a 501(c)(3) United States Federally exempt charitable organization yourself? I highly doubt this, as I have started 2 charitable organizations and they aren&#x27;t easy to get set up. If you are a for profit (or even a non-profit 501(c)(3)) organization and you take my organizations money and use a portion of it yourself and then pass the rest on to charity, do I get a tax advantage? How do I explain that properly to my accountant? Am I really being charitable and socially conscious? What portion goes to you for development and what part goes to charity? You could say &quot;a truly charitable and socially conscious organization wouldn&#x27;t worry about details like tax filing and advantages.&quot; I wish we didn&#x27;t have to think about these things, but the IRS is a cruel mistress and because of our fiduciary duty to our organizations we must all answer to IRS rules.<p>The list can keep on going, unfortunately.<p>As for the site itself, it loads very slowly. There are a lot of spinning gifs while your logo and your &quot;big block of corporate logos&quot; load. The wording is difficult to read. Other than the very nicely made video, I am afraid this looks like a corporate email fishing scheme. I don&#x27;t mean to be rude, but I am involved with an organization with a very high charitable dollar count and I would have a hard time signing up on your site.",1418231066

So for example, if everyone had a means of growing their own food, generating their own electricity, taking care of their own health, and had unlimited access to information, we wouldn&#x27;t need to buy things or pay for services.  A Mr. Fusion and a replicator would be all we needed.<p>That’s probably the real reason they don’t use money on Star Trek.  Not so much because they eliminated scarcity (which they obviously did, with numerous planets to choose from) but because giving everyone the basic means to sustain themselves was such a small fraction of the economy that it became dehumanizing to force people to work so much when society could provide for all within the percentage of a rounding error.<p>This concept’s relevance for coffee makers: what’s a coffee maker without coffee?  Anyone can brew coffee by pouring hot water through a sock (as it’s done in much of the developing world) and I can say from experience that it’s both more convenient and can even make a better cup.  So the key is the coffee, not the machine.  It’s not really surprising that Keurig wants to cement itself as a middleman, and since coffee is everywhere, it was probably inevitable that they’d turn to a DRM solution.<p>Hydroponics, fabless photovoltaics and big data medicine are going to be what take us into the future, not some kitchen gismo.

Either the descendants of a directory include the directory&#x27;s name in their identifier, or they don&#x27;t.  If they do, then to implement rename() you need to do something such that all descendants of the directory can be queried by a different identifier than the one they were given upon creation (where the difference is exactly the name change of an ancestor directory).  You can:<p>* rename all descendants on directory rename (expensive--takes O(n) time for n descendants).<p>* log each rename() and translate a key with a new directory name into a key with the original directory name (requires O(k) space for k renames and O(d) time in the worst case for translating a path of depth d whose directories have all been renamed; introduces the need to garbage-collect log records when all descendants of a renamed directory get deleted).<p>Granted, this is a more nuanced than what I said before about rename() requiring O(n) time complexity when implemented on top of a key/value store, but the second option is still more costly than rename() with true directories.

HDR can be used for photography that, once composed and edited, will present more realistic information to our eyes. For example, with HDR you wouldn&#x27;t have an overexposed sky - however the HDR is only used in order to <i>get to</i> that final 16 bit image (and even with 16 bit your eyes have a hard time discerning different colors).<p>The same applies to audio. <i></i>Listening<i></i> to 24-bit is pointless, however, if you are editing something you want to retain as much information as possible until the final render so that you don&#x27;t run into clamping issues as you described.<p>Therefore, sites that provide 192/24 downloads are valuable. If I&#x27;m a DJ getting music for my gig I do want those production quality files, as I cross-fade between two songs I don&#x27;t want artefacts popping (excuse the pun) up.<p>On to my own opinion: 24-bit is still not good enough. DAWs should be working in floats. Audio needs to go true HDR, 24-bit is a cop-out. Why would you even used a 24-bit int when floats are there and ready to go? Imagery went floating point, what, 10 years ago? Why can&#x27;t audio catch up? Being able to exceed the clip in my DAW in a channel, and then wrangle it back down in another would be awesome.<p><i>Unrelated: That Xiph video really amazes in terms of what nature does. We rarely care about it (we do in terms of e.g. intercontinental fibre cables), but nature does all of this when we send a signal to a speaker. Even normal sound does actually have a band limit and does behave (albeit, far higher dynamic range) exactly the same way automatically. Shoot a signal down a fibre cable that can&#x27;t handle it, and you&#x27;ll get Nyquist. Too high frequency for RTP air? Expect distortion (that we can&#x27;t hear). You don&#x27;t even have to include electronics to get nature to impose these limitations for you, you have to do no extra work. Completely amazing - a deeper level of logic that is mind boggling.</i><p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/DICEStudio/audio-for-multiplayer-beyond-mixing-case-studies-from-battlefield-bad-company-frostbite?from=ss_embed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/DICEStudio/audio-for-multiplayer-b...</a>",1418230838

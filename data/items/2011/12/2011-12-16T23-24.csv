3362839,comment,3361181,3361346,1,0,tomordonez,,,"Hey Alex,
I lived in Miami for 7 years and moved to Chicago 4 years ago. I recently organized CodeRetreatMiami.com and a lot of people showed up.<p>This was unexpected for me. I thought 4 people would registered and 22 people showed up and stayed all day.<p>My objective with the event was to start paying my dues back to Miami and bring back what I have learned from the tech scene in Chicago.<p>I contacted a few of the leaders of the local meetups and got good responses from most of them. I also contacted 2 guys that seemed to have been putting a lot into the community and surprisingly both blew me off.<p>I have been comparing the tech communities of Boston, Austin, Chicago, SF and Miami. People from SF have said that one of the most important key in the startup community is collaboration. By that he meant that you would be able to contact anybody from the tech community no matter how high their position is and most of the times they would be able to give you some time to talk to you.<p>The same is happening here in Chicago. I could call anybody to ask for advice and they would actually find time for you to meet you. Nobody (so far) is trying to rip off your idea, instead they want to hear your problem and see how they can help.<p>There are a lot of meetups here and usually a lot of people show up. The meetup with the most attendance is the Lean Startup. On average they get 200 people to a meetup and they come from all over the city and the suburbs. Some people even drive up to an hour and a half to get to those meetups. And not only this but also other tech meetups like Ruby, Android, Drupal. Which means that distance is not important even if we have good transportation system.<p>The same happens with Austin. You have to drive everywhere just like Miami. Austin has a scene because real state is cheap, a couple of big tech companies are there and there is a college in the middle of downtown.<p>I would say that even when people say that the problem with Miami is the distances, I would say is not a problem comparing the same to Chicago and Austin.<p>I would say that the challenges are people communicating with each other, encouraging people to go to events and evangelize an attitude of collaboration.",1324079271

3362828,comment,3362163,3362296,1,0,ajessup,,,"I think any corporate data warehouse is an area that Hadoop+Pig/Hive could add a huge amount of value. Here's why. Conventional data warehouses are built from running ETL transforms against existing sources, where you are carefully selecting which attributes you want to transform in. These transforms are tricky to set up and even trickier to change if you decide you need a new piece of data (which happens every day in big BI implementations). And if the source system isn't permanently preserving the data (eg. log files) then pulling in data retrospectively often isn't possible.<p>With a HDFS cluster you can cost effectively dump undifferentiated data from existing sources into a ""data lake"" without worrying about complex and highly selective transforms, and then use tools like Pig and Hive to do ad-hoc interrogations of the data.<p>Most data warehouse implementations fail to a large extent because of the ETL problem - Hadoop could help solve that in a big way.<p>Further reading (no connection to me)

3362809,comment,3361322,3362195,4,0,azakai,,,"> You're not the first person to posit that adding a new VM ""almost guarantees breakage"". So what? Keep the old VM, transition to the new one by specifying that's what you're targeting, then deprecate the old VM and eventually lose it altogether.<p>That means both VMs will be in the browser together at some point. That is a <i></i>hard<i></i> problem, for example because of cross-VM garbage collection (the WebKit thread where Apple refuses to accept Dart into WebKit references some papers on that).<p>This will cause an immediate slowdown on existing code, and a very large maintenance burden, for example you typically need to optimize fast paths in the DOM for your VM, with two VMs that is double the work, and if the VMs are allowed to communicate - and they can, if they can both access the DOM - then you have three paths to optimize now.<p>It's possible to migrate from one version of a language to another - say Python 2.x to 3.x. But they are not both running in the same process and communicating directly with a third shared environment like we would have on the web.<p>I hate to be negative about this, because as engineers we all love technical challenges.

We envision this app to help people find and share interior design tips and ideas and post questions or get advice from professional interior designers. The app in the current version allows you to take images and post them along with your question. Other users can then comment on your post or share it on Facebook. We have another version coming up with more sharing options and better camera/image UI and layout.<p>There are a few problems I know are there and I don't have concrete ways to solve:
1. Getting the message across. I find it difficult to explain the idea to people. It's not complicated at all but I think my choice of words is not correct and people don't understand the idea of the app if I email it to them, or through the app store. We've got about 300 downloads in the past week but only a handful of people have used the app.
What do you think after reading the website and app store descriptions? How can I improve it? How can I convert those downloads to users?<p>2. How do I get professionals to use the app? We plan on having professional profiles where people can search for designers in their areas. That is for a future release, and for that to work, I need to introduce the app to professionals in the field who would want to use the app in the first place to market themselves, answer questions, post ideas etc.. I look up professional interior designers online and personally them on twitter and through email but I'm not seeing ANY feedback. I think I'm lost and need help in targeting and finding the correct users, partners.<p>3. Any general advice on the product. We've built the app and the web backend such that we can change it for other domains and add and remove features. Initially, we thought of a framework we can provide other companies so that they can have their own similar apps. Although we aren't going that route yet, we ourselves can change directions easily, if need be.<p>About the company: We are just 2 developers with full time jobs and a shoestring budget.",1324077855

""A gene for altruism, then, is any gene that, compared with its alleles, causes individuals to benefit other individuals at a cost to themselves."" ... ""But the kind of mutation that could lead to such altruistic restraint could be ludicrously simple. A genetic propensity to bad teeth might slow down the rate at which an individual could chew at the meat.

Indeed, it's a weaker but analogous form of what leads to eusociality. You say ""it can't apply evolutionary pressure because it depends on the prevalence of the gene in other members of the population"", .... and I think I understand why we disagree. I wrote ""population"" but sometimes meant ""species population"" and at other times meant ""gene population.""<p>In an extreme hypothetical case, suppose that having a gay sibling help to raise a family meant a 5% improved chance that each child would live to adulthood and children in turn. Suppose also that having two gay siblings meant a -1% improved chance (perhaps because the person consumes more food, which could otherwise go to the children). Then there's strong kin selection here to have some, but not all, gay children.

Those are things he sees as more valuable than using star wars metaphors for designing robots, not seeing that there is utility in research and research can sometimes be made fun. Star Wars is not the only influence on the west coast, there is also the very major influence of Star Trek devices on Apple's entire current business model since we've been seeing iPads on west coast produced TV programs since the 1980s and Siri since the 1960s. New Yorkers, as is evidenced by the comments, see that stuff as a bunch of stupid childish geek stupidity which they have contempt and disdain for. Getting bailouts, buying jet airplanes, and having servants are what proper adults should be interested in. Hah, I guess you can tell which coast I favor, I'm biased as well.",1324077102

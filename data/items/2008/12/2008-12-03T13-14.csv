Nobody has solved this problem well.<p>From experience, here is what I can recommend and why:<p><pre><code>  * TinyMCE - If you need an editor that has many features, go with this. The latest version have improved code output, but it is still questionable.  Of the feature-packed editors it is the most lightweight and produces the best code.

  * WidgEditor - It is ugly by default and has very few features.  It is probably also hard to extend.  That said it produces very clean code.

  * YUI Rich Text Editor - It is comparatively young and still pretty good.  If you use YUI it is probably good enough.</code></pre>",1228312762

384324,comment,383839,383839,0,0,markessien,,,"I'm still not impressed. There are many things wrong with it:<p>1. I don't know anyone who actually likes javascript. Lots of people use it, but I've never met anyone who loves it. People love ruby, python, C++, VB6, Delphi, Lisp, Clojure, but there are some languages that people just use but don't love, and Javascript is one of them<p>2. Why ever would I put my eggs in their basket? Learn a new framework, and have all this run on their servers? They may pull this anytime, and what am I left with - a .jar file that I now have to purchase some expensive server to run with?<p>3. I don't see that they will scale. Google, I KNOW they scale because they are at the top of the heap, but I don't know who AppJet are.<p>Frameworks and languages are a big investment for a programmer, and AppJet offers a lot of uncertainty, but no clear benefit.<p>Sorry about this, but this one gets my thumb down (again).",1228312233

384321,comment,384139,384189,0,0,jm4,,,"It's the same sort of line as ""5000 songs in your pocket"" or whatever they used to say about the iPod. Some people read it and think ""it's got enough space to hold about 5000 songs"". Others read it and think of it in the context of a CD rack or something that holds exactly 100 CDs. In other words, it's got exactly 5000 slots for you to put your songs in. Something like that is common sense to most of us, but when you think about where we came from it's not so clear. A 30GB iPod could be filled any number of ways depending on codecs and bitrates. Just a few years ago music storage was measured as an exact number of minutes.<p>But I can sort of see where they're coming from. It's like if I trade in my sports car for an SUV and tell people how much I like it because it's got twice as much room. No one expects a statement like that to be based on exact measurements. I think their marketing is going for the same sort of tone-- kind of how a non-technical person is going to explain to a friend why the new version of a product is better than the old one. ""It's great! It's twice as fast as my old one and only cost me half as much.""<p>You see marketing slogans like this everywhere. I can imagine a car ad saying something like, ""you'll never be short on power with 250 horses under the hood!"" What reasonable person is going to believe the car comes with horses? I think that's what they're getting at here, and when you consider it in that context their argument makes much more sense. I'm sure with a little digging one could find enough examples to convince just about anyone that only an idiot would believe advertisements.<p>The headline is worded in a way to suggest that Apple is completely in the wrong or being overly harsh. The situation isn't that black and white.",1228312005

I had just big enough a vocabulary for it to be no effort for me to understand her, even if I never used such words personally, whereas everybody around me just went ""huh?""

384310,comment,384133,384133,0,0,smoody,,,"Is it that hard to guess? There are perhaps hundreds of companies using Twitter as a rapid-response support channel ( <a href=""http://twitter.com/slicehost"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/slicehost</a> ). And not just small companies, but big companies like JetBlue, Comcast, etc. Some of these companies have people actively participating, others appear to have scripts that look for the mention of a company name and auto-follow those users' streams as a good-will measure (how easy and cool -- ""JetBlue is following my tweets!""). Because of the novelty, Twitter-based support generates a great deal of word-of-mouth press, which is very important in a time when products and services that used to be considered necessities are now considered luxuries.<p>Will companies pay to have access to that channel? Absolutely. How much? Who knows, but I do not think that $100/month is unreasonable for small-to-midsize companies and $1000/month or more for larger companies -- it can be based on the number of tweets sent perhaps. Given that, twitter could be free for personal use but corporate use could require a subscription.<p>There - that wasn't so hard, was it? Not that I'm claiming I'm right or anything, but that's what I'd be considering.",1228310140
384309,comment,382899,383017,0,0,1gor,,,">non-acceptance of dirty cops is something inherent to American culture.<p>That is exactly the case. America would not have succeeded economically without certain traits, relative immunity to corruption being one of them.<p>In game theory a player may have two strategies - to 'cooperate' or to 'defect' (law-abiding behaviour vs corruption). It has been demonstrated that in absence of punishment the defection (corruption) may be the best strategy for an individual, even though it may be harmful for the society as a whole.<p>Americans have developed a virtuous cycle where certainty of punishment (the society and the legal system there as a whole are relatively not corrupt) stimulates intolerance towards corruption among individuals. Remaining non-corrupt and rooting out corruption is profitable in the USA. But in an already corrupt society it may impossible for the individual to remain honest.",1228309957

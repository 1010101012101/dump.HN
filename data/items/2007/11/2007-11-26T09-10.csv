i've kept an eye on programming for a while now but always find myself bored with if/elif but not able to figure out how to make the leap to the stuff that i want to do - and then not having the time to dive in fully.  catch 22 i guess.  would be happy to comment further if anyone's interested.",1196070713

I've got a new clean hosted instance, and was thinking it would be neat to be able to use mercurial for source control on my laptop, and know that it was constantly duplicated on my leased hosting.<p>Any advice?",1196069620
83527,comment,83460,83460,0,0,janl,,,"See <a href=""http://www.ajatus.info/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ajatus.info/</a> for a personal CRM based on CouchDB. Make sure to read the manifesto. <p>For what it solves for me: It's schemaless structure allows me to develop and deploy much faster, because I don't have to spread my data across tables and find the correct and fastest JOINs to get the data back. Online replication makes high-availability a snap, the same goes for load distribution. Offline replication saves me from DB syncing issues when there's no network.<p>Being alpha software, it does not yet have a full fledged permission and authentication system (though planned and 
prepared for, it is not yet implemented) and I really wish it did, but that's going to be a matter of time.<p>Is it better than a traditional RDBMS? That's the wrong question in general. It is another tool and if it fits your problem is for you to decide. I still use plenty of relational databases.<p>

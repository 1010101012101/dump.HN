They&#x27;ve been working for over 10 years on this and shown almost nothing.<p>The capsule looks nice; big curved windows and no RCS thrusters tell us that this is not an orbital capsule.<p>The 1st Stage reuse concept is interesting; the ducting near the capsule connector is quite novel. There are 8 large spoilers that protrude into the airflow to help slow descent. I wonder if these can be modulated to give some kind of stability control?<p>It&#x27;s interesting to note that although the capsule landed successfully, they make no mention of what happened to the launcher. I presume that it failed to land, but I didn&#x27;t see any smoking wreckage in the background of the capsule landing video, so maybe it made it down in 1 piece?

If you take a bag, your little laptop can come. If not, phones fit in pockets and need to come anyway. The space between the two got smaller, I agree.<p>My 3 years old Ipad&#x27;s job is mostly watching movies on planes. It does that job well enough and I won&#x27;t replace it unless it breaks. I just don&#x27;t need any more from a tablet.<p>Honestly, I think iPad&#x27;s will almost go the way of the ipod, but with tougher competition. Good enough.<p>OTOH, if I was king of the apple…. I think a good idea for a new product category is a ~€500 iOS laptop. Chrome OS is selling well, and I think Apple would probably do a better job in that general space. Iphone apps could run as &#x27;widgets&quot; which would automatically tick a lot of boxes (Skype, VLC.. whatever your non negotiable apps are).<p>There&#x27;s still a poorly served market here.

We want to have trust that the pixels on the desktop monitor or iPhone are actually correct.  Whether a user is a city administrator looking at weather.com pixels to decide whether to shutdown schools for the day, or a grandmother looking at NYT or Yahoo pixels to check a stock price before selling, encryption helps ensure the veracity of what their eyeballs see.<p>Grandma doesn&#x27;t care if the government or Facebook knows she read the New York Times.  Someone on the subway can look over her shoulder to discover that same datapoint.   On the other hand, she does need to have confidence that what she reads has not been tampered with.<p>One could attempt to write &quot;data protection&quot; protocols that send multiple hashes to verify the payload.

We&#x27;re not going to make the Internet less secure for the benefit of government interception; if anything, we&#x27;re making it more secure <i>because</i> of the possibility of government interception.  This one is a very old argument, and easily debunked: assuming you allow any encryption at all, just having <i>less</i> of it doesn&#x27;t make lawful interception any easier, because of course all the illicit traffic will be encrypted.  The only thing it does is make encrypted traffic seem more suspicious, which isn&#x27;t good for <i>anyone</i>.<p>SNI works just about everywhere these days, and it&#x27;s quite safe for most services to just turn it on and write off the few systems (IE on XP, and truly ancient mobile devices) that can&#x27;t cope.<p>People don&#x27;t get used to clicking certificate warnings away because browsers have gone out of their way to make that painful, and it <i>should</i> be.<p>If you don&#x27;t understand TLS, learn, or count on other people to have learned.

It seemed that we could either have the unflappable resolve of a Steve Davis (six-time World Champ) or the charismatic fragility of a Jimmy White (six-time runner-up), but we couldn&#x27;t have both in one player. By only self-destructing either before the start of a tournament or after winning one, O&#x27;Sullivan has cleverly defied this convention. He doesn&#x27;t fall apart in the crucial stages of a match; he plays consistently throughout, either like the greatest player in the world or only, say, the twelfth best.

It essentially allows you to use an enhanced version of HTML, so you keep the strengths of a DSL without the limitations of basic HTML.<p>But in pure HTML, how do you do something like ng-repeat?[1]  You can’t.  You have to either use a template language or you have to construct the HTML in the code.  Both have goods and others.  A template language allows you to keep an HTML like format that non-programmer’s can possibly understand and contribute to, and that can help separate the view from the business logic, but it comes at the cost of having to learn a new language / framework and the hurdles that abstractions sometimes create.<p>Similar question on Quora.

The sites in question provide advertising for gambling sites, online product listings, and normally make use of affiliate schemes. Yet they are hosted in the USA, on generic TLDs such as .com and .net to bypass China’s TLD and internet content provider (ICP) license requirements. Unusually, each linkfarm makes use of a reasonably large number of domains and IP addresses, presumably making them harder for search engines to evade. This would normally be cost prohibitive for this kind of activity, however hosting and domain packages can be found advertised on auction sites specifically for this purpose, with packages of (random/unspecified) .com domains available for as little as ¥17 (~ £2 / $3) each, guaranteed to remain yours for at least a month. It is not clear why IIS has been chosen for these sites, however it does have a considerably higher market share (for all of our metrics) in China compared to worldwide - for example 59% of domains hosted in China use IIS compared to just 29% worldwide.&quot;</i><p>source: <a href=""http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2014/07/31/july-2014-web-server-survey.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2014/07/31/july-2014-web-s...</a>",1430405049

Norway&#x27;s constitution used to have a clause that states a &quot;right to work&quot; rather than stating that parliament can not pass laws that have the effect of restricting peoples right to work. The effect is the same, and the former approach is to my knowledge far more common in constitutional law.<p>> In passing a law that knowingly violates the constitution, the politicians are acting to _enable_ crimes, or rather, actions considered crimes under existing legislation.<p>A major part of a parliaments <i>function</i> is to alter what is considered crimes under existing legislation. If they can not do this without fear of criminal prosecution if one of these laws are found to conflict with the constitution...

Just last night, thousands of people poured into the streets in peaceful marches through town and to city hall.  It also happened last weekend.<p>I&#x27;m not excusing violence or suggesting that it is productive...but I get it.  Human beings have tipping points.  It&#x27;s different for every individual but when pressure builds and crowds start moving, brawls and riots aren&#x27;t uncommon to see.  This happens even when people are <i>happy</i> about something (like a home team winning a championship game).<p>So you can imagine that when the media starts freaking out and spreading some viral &quot;meme&quot; about planned riots and sends in a couple hundred riot cops (and a tank!) to corral a couple hundred high school kids at their bus stop, preventing them from going home, there might just be some of those people who are a little more pissed off than the rest and have a little less impulse control and decide to start throwing water bottles and rocks.<p>And once shit starts rolling that way and the situation escalates, you can see why some people who might have been shit on and beaten up by cops all their life might just see this as a chance to hit back.<p>So you get a few hundred cops fighting with a few hundred pissed off citizens and the broken cars and windows we all saw on TV.<p>But those few hundred people who went the violent route are still a few hundred out of tens of thousands who live here.  The vast majority of us (many of which have had it <i>MUCH</i> better than the people in West Baltimore) haven&#x27;t been angry or frustrated enough to resort to violence.  Thousands of us have marched and petitioned and protested.  But it doesn&#x27;t surprise me in the least that for a few hundred of us, a bat to the cop car seemed like a bit of payback for generations of a boot to the throat.",1430404210

Yet it is naive in the extreme to suppose that facts – especially the facts of the social sciences – speak for themselves.  Not only is it true that sound analysis is unavoidably a judgment-laden mix of rigorous reasoning (“theory”) with careful observation of the facts; it is also true that the facts themselves are in large part the product of theorizing.<p>...<p>No one who reads this work – and there’s plenty of it – can possibly decide, based on the data alone, whether minimum-wage legislation does or does not reduce the employment options of low-skilled workers.  It’s not just that the conclusions drawn from the empirical evidence differ wildly.  It’s more that coming to a conclusion requires reasoning about - theorizing about – the data.  These data (like all data) do not speak for themselves.  It’s just not what data do.<p><a href=""http://cafehayek.com/2015/04/theorizing-about-the-facts-theres-no-escaping-theory.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cafehayek.com/2015/04/theorizing-about-the-facts-ther...</a>",1430403085
9465134,comment,9464961,9464961,0,0,DanielStraight,,,"Python 3.<p>It is fairly simple to learn. It is cross-platform. It is suitable for server-side programming. It has an extensive standard library and an active ecosystem for additional libraries. It has IPython. It uses, and therefore helps you learn, but does not force object-oriented programming. It has enough functional programming to let you explore that concept. It is widespread and easy to find support for. It has numerous tutorials taking a wide variety of approaches, you can easily find something that works for you. It has more active projects on GitHub than any language but JavaScript or Java (<a href=""http://githut.info/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://githut.info/</a>).<p>Why not Python 2? Python 3 is better out of the box (comes with pip, has better standard libraries) and more consistent. As a new programmer, you won&#x27;t need anything that&#x27;s limited to Python 2.<p>Why not JavaScript? It&#x27;s too strange. Most of what you learn in Python is fairly applicable across languages. JavaScript has a strange object model, doesn&#x27;t distinguish int/float, has odd rules for scoping (var/no var, hoisting), has too many ways to do the same things (function / var f = function, new Object() / {} / Object.create), has a confusing concept of &#x27;this&#x27;. Learning JavaScript will not help other mainstream languages click the way Python will.<p>Why not Ruby? Ruby and Python are, from a new programmers&#x27; perspective, completely equivalent, but Python seems to be winning the popularity contest, so you&#x27;ll likely find more libraries, more tutorials, more help, etc. Ruby also tends to be more web-focused and thus less general-purpose (by the numbers, not by any technical limitation).<p>Why not C/C++? They are simply too low level for someone who isn&#x27;t interested in programming full-time.<p>Why not Java? Java is improving but is historically bloated and incredibly verbose. You have deal with compilation and probably need an IDE. You absolutely must use object-oriented programming. Support for functional programming is either effectively non-existent or simply not as smooth depending on which version of Java you&#x27;re using. Too much overhead (in terms of what you have to understand and deal with) for small, simple programs.<p>Why not Go or Rust? Too new to have thorough support. Uncertain future.<p>Why not Haskell / Clojure / Erlang / Factor / etc / etc / etc? Too esoteric for a new programmer.<p>Why not Objective-C or Swift? Too limited in scope.<p>Why not C#? Actually, if you&#x27;re on Windows, this is a pretty good choice, but it&#x27;s not fully cross-platform (yet) and doesn&#x27;t have the variety of choices for server-side programming that Python does. It also doesn&#x27;t have as extensive a set of open source libraries.",1430403083

9465119,comment,9460628,9463879,0,0,bryondowd,,,"The fact is that many jobs are exactly as you describe. An average high school kid can be trained to do the job within a week and perform at least 90% as well as someone who&#x27;s been doing it for 10 years. That&#x27;s why those jobs pay minimum wage. You want almost all your employees to be like this, and maybe one person with experience in a marginally higher position to handle unusual cases.<p>For instance, a clothing store pays a number of people minimum wage to work the registers, keep the racks/shelves stocked and organized, and clean the place. Then they pay (not substantially) more for a few managers to keep things running smoothly. Usually there are many more employees than managers, and while an employee might be promoted to manager, there are so few openings that the average employee can&#x27;t expect to rise at all. There&#x27;s no reason to give these people any significant raise because they can be replaced in a week with another kid at minimum wage. The only incentive to pay a little bit more for someone who sticks around long term is because they tend to be more reliable in terms of showing up for their scheduled shift, but even that isn&#x27;t uncommon enough to be worth much.<p>It&#x27;s the same for any position that doesn&#x27;t require a developed skill. Stocking shelves, unloading trucks, cashiers, cleaners, some basic customer service positions like a host(ess) at a cheap restaurant (the people who greet you at the door and show you to your seat for $8/hour).<p>I would guess that there are at least in the tens of millions of these positions in the US, so probably at least 5-10% of the population. Some of these are students who will rise out of it by getting a degree and landing an entry level position elsewhere, but I doubt that covers the majority.<p>And people will fight over these jobs, simply because they don&#x27;t have skills to get a better one, and need to either work 2-3 jobs at once to get by, or pool their resources and live in a group with a number of other people who work the same jobs or only slightly better.<p>Here&#x27;s some examples [1][2] that cover a small group of the described jobs. This accounts for a bit under 8 millions jobs. The site there isn&#x27;t granular enough to get many other positions, as they are lumped in with others that earn more, like &quot;Hand Laborers&quot; which has a median income a couple dollars higher and adds a few million more jobs.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/sales/cashiers.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/ooh/sales/cashiers.htm</a>

Once you purchase a sufficiently powerful device there is no need to upgrade it in anything like the sales cycle that people like Apple are hoping for.<p>A yearly product update is useless for a device that is primarily used to view the internet, check email and watch Netflix or whatever. If it does that when you buy it, it will do it for 4 or 5 years. It lives on the couch or on the bed meaning general wear and tear don&#x27;t exist much so replacement from damage is a low possibility too.<p>Apple even help out here because the App Store makes getting old versions of the apps that are supported on your version of the device (where available) transparent, thus the feeling of becoming out-dated is kind of non-existent unless you are a tablet gamer.<p>For example until last month both me and my partner used a Gen 1 iPad probably for 2 or 3 hours a day every day. I upgraded to a newer version mostly because JS heavy pages like the Guardian and Facebook had started to crash regularly.

We were upgrading pretty fast at the start (upgrade ours, give our to others) particularly because of the iOS compatibility problems with older iPads.  That changed in the last 18 months, we don&#x27;t upgrade as aggressively and it seems like we can keep using our older hardware longer.  The iPhone is an every two years item (buy, skip next, buy), and that doesn&#x27;t seem to be changing.<p>I would bet on a bump with a bigger screen model which will put some distance from the phablet iPhones.  I really see no reason for both an iPod touch and iPad mini.",1430402456

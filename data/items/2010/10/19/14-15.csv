I got lapped on a mile in high school (the guy ran a sub-5!)<p>Have you read Once a Runner? Was that what your training life was like?<p>Interesting offshoot - The whole point of training 20 hours a week for the Ironman triathlon (2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike, 26.2 mile marathon) is so that the body never goes anaerobic during the actual Ironman race. When the body goes anaerobic (lactic acid buildup), everything goes downhill rapidly - it goes from racing a PR (personal record) to whether you will finish the race.<p>And then there are the Marathon Monks of Tendai:<p>> The ultimate achievement is the completion of the 1,000-day challenge, which must surely be the most demanding physical and mental challenge in the world. Forget ultra-marathons and so-called iron-man events, this endurance challenge surpasses all others.<p>Only 46 men have completed the 1,000-day challenge since 1885. It takes seven years to complete, as the monks must undergo other Buddhist training in meditation and calligraphy, and perform general duties within the temple.<p><a href=""http://www.howtobefit.com/tendai-marathon-monks.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.howtobefit.com/tendai-marathon-monks.htm</a>",1287500328

The ""impedance mismatch"" of writting a tree using sequential text strings is what makes fragile the tools that IDEs feature.<p>That code is seen as text is just a historical accident. I believe most serious programmers have been beaten by some incomplete implementation of graphical interfaces and accepted to fall back to good old plain text.<p>But we are in 2010. This acceptance of this state of matters is very unfortunate. Specially sad is when the author says that IDEs are no more than text editors with some extended capabilities. They shouldn't! They should load the code in all its glorious shape... that by no means is a chunk of text.",1287500220

Easy visualization is the reason why word processors, photo editors, video editors, music notation and audio software, DTP packages, and 3D programs are so much more powerful than IDEs.

You just have to try Hyperion/Fall of Hyperion, by Dan Simmons.  At first I thought it was ridiculous space opera, with loads of jargon and technical impossibilities that just made it read like 3rd-rate SF.  That is right up until the point where Simmons blindsighted me by making all of that stuff an absolutely necessary part of the story.  I can be more explicit without giving out a few spoilers, but I've read <i>a lot</i> of SF, and this is really a cut above the rest.",1287497650

Person X wrote a widget, then something changed elsewhere to make it obsolete, but there wasn't time to rewrite it to properly reflect the new situation, so instead Person Y added some quick workarounds.  Now neither X nor Y fully understands the widget any more.  (Y might equal X - it's hard for a good programmer to feel ownership for a rush job they know to be suboptimal.)<p>Later, there's a codebase-wide optimisation drive, driven by person Z.  Z asks who owns the widget, both X and Y shrug, so Z skims through the code, comes to his own incomplete understanding, and duct tapes over the patches from the previous rush job.<p>In this way the widget becomes a no-man's-land, where everyone goes to add a quick hack, but nobody wants to take enough responsibility for to nuke it from orbit.",1287497640

So all this Macintosh had the market and lost it to PCs is basically and untrue premise.  It's not fanboyism to say a critique is not fact based, it is just good thought process.

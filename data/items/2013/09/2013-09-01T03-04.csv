Specifically I mean the methods of analysis like hand-writing analysis, polygraphs, and even more &quot;scientific&quot; methods like finger-prints or DNA evidence.  These methods of investigation are often portrayed in popular media as 100% effective in providing proof, however their real rates of effectiveness are quite a bit lower.<p>Much of these techniques are not as effective as claimed or perceived, but are used as a tool to bring pressure to bear on criminals to cause them to implicate themselves indirectly or confess completely to their crimes.<p>Much crime is solved merely by rounding up the &quot;likely suspects&quot; and tricking them into thinking that the case is already solved and the criminal just has a chance to admit and gain some sort of ameliorative to their sentence.",1378007616

You might find business in this service, but only in companies which don&#x27;t know any better.

The people which make up said company.<p>The best candidates know this rule intuitively. They&#x27;ve completely internalized it. When these candidates imagine an excellent place to work, they imagine it first in these terms.

You&#x27;re just separating the wheat from the chaff, right?<p>Maybe the company knows that you/your service is/are incredibly competent at this task.

Quality of communication.<p>You see there is ongoing debate amongst the Agile software development community as to what methodologies are most helpful; test-driven-development, refactoring, code reviews, static code analysis...<p>I maintain that that start-ups have the edge mainly because there is more pairing (pair-programming / pair-design / pair-refactoring / pair-testing) than there currently is in most software shops - and the reason this is so effective is the boost it gives to communication...<p>Now the DNA angle you ask, well in 2009 a team won the Nobel Prize for Medicine for proving that chronic stress inhibits the brain from releasing Telomerase that repairs the Telomeres that protect the end of your chromosomes during cell-division (crossing over).  Guess what causes most workplace stress - miscommunication... and in software also the fact that you are often unfortunately forced to work alone.  Start-ups force you to work together and that is why you are healthier and live longer and, incidentally, write better software ;-)",1378006678

In my experience, what separates the best data scientists from the worst - and there&#x27;s an <i>order of magnitude</i> difference in productivity between them, at least, enough that a poor data-scientist will <i>never</i> come up with a useful result - is the ability to quickly visualize their data set and understand its &quot;shape&quot;.

So we get patents that claim all methods of achieving a particular outcome rather than being limited to some subset that the patentee ostensibly invented.<p>The problem with software is that the alternative would break the patent system the other way, because there are so many reasonable alternative implementations of any given abstraction that a patent on any one of them would be effectively worthless (or just equivalent to copyright) since any decent engineer would easily be able to work around it.

Your position is one where every few months, you have a large number of people pissed off at you for being rejected. Tread carefully, Rumpelstiltskin.",1183095004
31547,comment,31059,31176,0,0,tyler,,,"""Is that because more and more of web development is done by people without CS degrees who had never heard of MVC before?""<p>Is that jab really necessary?  There are very distinct advantages to getting a CS degree, for certain.  But, knowing what MVC is/was and having a CS degree have very little in common.",1183094865

I'd say that the new breed of millitant Rubyists has emerged from Rails, rather than the other way around.<p>That being said, however, the seemingly constant attacks by every person who takes it for a spin and doesn't love every aspect of it does get pretty irritating.<p>But, I suppose, as long as they're being constructive, no harm done.",1183094380
31545,comment,31137,31254,0,0,tyler,,,"I don't understand the constant attacks on Rails documentation.  There are very few things that I can't find in the documentation provided.  Not to mention, if you have a solid knowledge of Ruby, the Rails code itself makes for pretty good documentation.",1183094110

Whatever experiences I had back then could more likely reflect the experiences felt by other single founders here. <p>Most YCer's know the game and how it's played. We all know to a certain degree that the odds are stacked against you when you're a single founder. I won't wax rhetoric with you cuz I'm sure you'll find a ton of posts about that. <p>My point is this when I couldn't find a suitable co-founder I said screw it, I'm building my product by myself with no venture backing whatsoever. If it fails, it fails. If it succeeds then great. You won't know whats out there for you until you go out and let your balls hang out so to speak. 
Go out there and build it no matter the odds, no matter what other people think, if you did your homework and think there's market for it. Go do it! there is no better time to test out that idea of yours than now. Open source and low low hardware costs present us a low barrier of entry in order for us to carry this out. <p>There are alot of naysayers that will tell you this and that. But the way I see it only time and customers/users will tell you if your product is a success or not. And that my friend matters more than anything. Single founder or not. ",1183094058

Although it is not as popular as Prototype and what not. <p>Plus I have loads of fun hacking away with Jquery :-) hope you do too if you decide to use it. ",1183093203

Up until 2007, first time conviction on possession of 5 grams of crack cocaine, a drug supposedly used predominantly by blacks (supposedly, but not really), would result in a mandatory sentencing of 5 years [1].  If you were lucky and got caught with powder cocaine instead, you would have to have 500 grams in your possession to suffer a similar fate.  This was the 100 to 1 sentencing disparity that was reduced to 18:1 in 2010 [2].<p>That&#x27;s not all.  Roughly 80% of those convicted for possession of crack cocaine are black, only 10% are white [3][4].  Yet crack cocaine usage within both races is about the same [5].<p>If you analyse conviction rates vs use for different classes (rich vs poor), I bet you&#x27;ll find similarly outrageous numbers.<p>1. <a href=""http://famm.org/Repository/Files/FS%20Brief%20History%20of%20Crack%20Laws%204.13.12.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://famm.org/Repository/Files/FS%20Brief%20History%20of%2...</a>

I discovered meteor when I was just beginning to seriously code web applications, and regardless of the downsides it has, it was truly, truly fun. The ability to rapidly go from idea to implementation is extremely fast, ridiculously simple to pick up, and it&#x27;s all in a simple to learn language, even for an absolute beginner.<p>Would i build my production app in meteor right now? For a prototype, yes. Would I transition from an established web application with a large userbase to meteor? Almost definitely no, at the current stage. But what we glorify here in this startup culture is to get an idea out and see if it works, and Meteor is absolutely amazing for exactly that. The simple deployment, the ease of use, and the freedom to build the structure as you choose (for better or for worse) truly opens many, many more doors than it closes at the early stage.<p>I&#x27;m no fanboy but I&#x27;m very excited to see where Meteor heads in the future and am extremely glad that it continues to gain traction and attention, be it positive or negative.",1384595687

6744257,comment,6740324,6740324,5,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"I think Nicholas Gallagher made the case against this best:<p><i>&quot;The experience of many skilled developers, over many years, has led to a shift in how large-scale website and applications are developed. Despite this, for individuals weaned on an ideology where semantic HTML means using content-derived class names (and even then, only as a last resort), it usually requires you to work on a large application before you can become acutely aware of the impractical nature of that approach. You have to be prepared to disgard old ideas, look at alternatives, and even revisit ways that you may have previously dismissed.<p>Once you start writing non-trivial websites and applications that you and others must not only maintain but actively iterate upon, you quickly realise that despite your best efforts, your code starts to get harder and harder to maintain. Its well worth taking the time to explore the work of some people who have proposed their own approaches to tackling these problems: Nicoles blog and Object Oriented CSS project, Jonathan Snooks Scalable Modular Architecture CSS, and the Block Element Modifier method that Yandex have developed.<p>When you choose to author HTML and CSS in a way that seeks to reduce the amount of time you spend writing and editing CSS, it involves accepting that you must instead spend more time changing HTML classes on elements if you want to change their styles. This turns out to be fairly practical, both for front-end and back-end developers  anyone can rearrange pre-built lego blocks; it turns out that no one can perform CSS-alchemy.&quot;</i><p>from &quot;About HTML semantics and front-end architecture&quot;

It&#x27;s incredibly expensive to lock someone up for their life - that&#x27;s four walls, meals, space to exercise and guards for say another 40 years. We shouldn&#x27;t spend that unless the alternative would cost a lot more (say violence against another person, a person&#x27;s life).<p><i>he woke two vacationing golfers as he entered the room and stole a wallet, then pretended to be a security guard and ran away</i><p>Crime is often impulsive, irrational. Now this guy had poor impulse control and started from a difficult position in life. He then did stupid things like petty crime. The loss to these golfers was probably $100 - balance that against the cost to society of a life in prison. I disagree that&#x27;s a worthwhile trade or is protecting society to any significant degree. It costs huge amounts of money, throws away a life that could be turned around, results in disproportionate and inhumane punishments, and doesn&#x27;t even help the victims. This is little better than deportation for stealing an apple.<p>The US has 1.6 million of its population in jail, and that figure rose very rapidly in the last few decades, probably due to laws like this and jailing people for minor drugs offences, I&#x27;m not convinced that has saved US society any money or even made it much safer.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_St...</a>",1384593281

The second one doesn&#x27;t really sexualize women.

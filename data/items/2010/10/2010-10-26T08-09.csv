It doesn't make sense to me that Digg would use such a public and labour-intensive method of promoting their partners' content.  I'd like to see data on what percentage of their partners were affected by this.  It could be that someone created the accounts then offered Digg's partners increased visibility in exchange for cash, suspecting that Digg wouldn't look too closely at gaming that favoured its customers.  Even then, LtGenPanda does state in his update that the activity stopped entirely after his email to Digg, but before he made the information public.  Further, they didn't simply ban the accounts, as banned accounts can still digg submissions and those accounts ceased all digging shortly after his email was sent.<p>It could be that Digg disabled the accounts, but if so, why not delete them?  Unless they have a shadowban feature that they're not telling anyone about, the timing and manner by which the accounts ceased their operations is highly suspicious.",1288083120

And here's a recount of the very early days of Apple according to the book:<p>Woz was working on the Apple II. Jobs saw a clever Intel ad. He called Intel marketing and found that Regis McKenna created the ad. After relentlessly calling the agency for weeks, Jobs finally wore down the secretary, and got a meeting with Mr. McKenna, and against all odds, persuaded him to take on Apple as a client. At the time, Apple had no outside investors yet. McKenna introduced Jobs to Don Valentine, who sat on the board of the marketing agency. Valentine said he'd invest if Apple brought on board a more experienced marketing guy. Jobs then relentlessly called Valentine for recommendations (there is a pattern here), who finally relented, and suggested Mike Markkula, who joined Apple and became one of the early investors.<p>That I'd consider a worthy non-tech founder. but then again, the traits that Jobs exhibited had nothing to do with MBA. I am not even sure there is anything distinctively 'business' about it. It's more just what PG called determinedness.",1288083026

I can't count the number of startups I have seen go down the drink because the founders wouldn't get off the computer and go and sell something.<p>I can tell you from personal experience how awesome it is when you get a business guy who works his ass off selling and handling contracts etc (I'm in b2b). Not only does it bring in many more sales, but it makes you more productive so you can concentrate on the task at hand - no context switching involved.<p>Now all someone has to do is solve the problem: how do you find competent business guys or programmers.

1833504,comment,1833010,1833219,0,0,SiVal,,,"Graham cares about having a better programming language, but he doesn't really care enough to do what it takes to make it happen. (He has no obligation to do so, of course.)<p>Practical programming languages these days aren't just ways of expressing ""algorithms,"" but toolkits for marshalling the vast information processing resources around the world (people, libraries, net protocols, platforms from microcontroller to supercluster, communications systems, etc.) The number of issues is enormous and growing. Useful programming languages have to have a whole army of specialists who provide feedback and code dealing with security, internationalization, performance, accessibility, net protocols, commercial-grade GUI wrapper/frameworks, installers, compilers/runtimes for countless platforms, scientific computing, embedded/realtime computing, frameworks of all sorts, dev tools.... Many of these things will be done poorly, if at all, if not accounted for in the design of the foundations of the language. That's the reason for the serious warts on all popular languages and the desire of many for something better designed.<p>Yet Graham's approach is, as always, to work privately, get feedback from the same half-dozen friends, then make announcements on a ""when we have something to announce, I'll announce it, so don't bother asking"" schedule. If none of his friends knows enough about international coding issues, for example, to even realize how little they know about text (something more important to Lisp than to most languages), then he'll make a silly architectural decision regarding Unicode, which he'll announce to, not discuss with, the rest of the world. Hey, if my friends don't seem concerned by it, it can't be very important, right?<p>This is too bad. Few languages have the potential Lisp has for creating flexible, evolvable code that can rapidly adapt to the changing world. Yes, I do think that the language matters, but it's the whole platform, not just the syntax.<p>But I don't think you can create a successful, practical, general purpose language these days without an army of specialist volunteers behind you. Graham's message to specialist volunteers is ""go away, you're not the people whose opinions I care about,"" so I think the language WILL last 100 years--in approximately its current form.",1288082361

I've heard of lawyers that refuse to send things in PDF (even if they are available in that format) because the receiving lawyers will just print them out and charge you for the printing costs (since you didn't send it to them on paper).

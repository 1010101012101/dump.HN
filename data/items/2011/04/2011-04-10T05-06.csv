I know a lot of people who go ""Oh i'll take time off and save up some money and go back in a year or two"" but they never do. Also be careful going to non-four yr schools from the start. If you have the grades, it would be good to go to a state school (cheaper). Tons of people go to community colleges (or some other pre-college school) to save money, but end up getting stuck there because units wont transfer or they can't get their classes. They end up spending way more money. Might be better off to just be a student worker and take out some loans.<p>You read about kids dropping out of college to pursue their business ideas, but the majority of them fail.

2428881,comment,2426825,2428484,3,0,mambodog,,,"Firstly this is just a terrible article as from the heading ""Digital Compression"" onwards it deals with an entirely unrelated topic to the ""Loudness Wars"" meme mentioned in the title; this is confusing to readers. More on this section later.<p>The ""Loudness War"" meme describes a trend in popular music towards having decreased dynamic range in the time-amplitude domain. In other words, less difference between the loudest and quietest passages of a piece of music; a higher average volume over time. While I totally agree that this trend has occurred, it's negative effects have been largely overstated. The reality is that a lot of music produced decades ago had such a large degree of dynamic range as to make it hard to listen to in most circumstances. Modern mastering techniques allow us to rectify this without losing any of the power of the original piece.<p>Proponents of the ""Loudness War"" idea often cherry-pick specific examples of poor mastering where average volume over time has been increased using naive methods that do in fact have a negative impact on the sound. This does not accurately reflect the state of the art of audio mastering. Unfortunately mastering is often seen as a bit of a ""dark art"" due to the large amount of domain-specific knowledge required.<p>Because of this lack of knowledge, people are easily deceived by naively credible diagrams[1] showing one ""skinny"" amplitude-time graph and one ""fat"" one, claiming that the fat one is dynamically flat/ruined. However, this graph gives no information about the time-frequency domain, where much of the 'magic' of mastering takes place.  The reality is that modern mastering techniques make much more effective use of all space available in each of the domains (time/amplitude/frequency).<p>In fact, many of these dynamic range management techniques are applied at the mixing stage of production (where all elements are processed seperately), before the mastering stage (where all elements are processed together). With modern tools and an understanding of psychoacoustics we can make pieces feel louder while preserving the shape and power of the various elements. It might make the time-amplitude graph look ""fat"", but that's hardly the whole picture.<p>Why the ""Digital Compression"" section is misleading: after giving us an almost uselessly simplified explanation of the digital representation of sound, it implies that it is common to encounter digital sound with a low resolution (bit depth and/or sample rate) however this is not the case, all CDs and MP3s one is likely to encounter have a bit depth of 16bit, and a sample rate of 44.1khz[2]. This is high enough as to be generally indistinguishable from higher resolutions to all but highly trained listeners.<p>[1] <a href=""http://media.npr.org/assets/music/news/2009/12/dynamic_wide.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://media.npr.org/assets/music/news/2009/12/dynamic_wide....</a><p>[2] One might find a few MP3s lying around on the internet with a lower sample rate, but not from any reputable source.",1302412556

I'm on the far side of an electrical engineering degree and by the end of it an extra year one way or the other makes no difference, but the amount of experience to be gained from just one year of trying to run a business is invaluable. If school is a priority for you, set a benchmark for yourself so that you are not tempted to drag along a failing business for years instead of going to school.<p>If you don't have access to a good network of hackers (to be a part of your team and to go to for advice), ignore what I just said.

Their marketing materials are full of exaggerations, inaccuracies and half-truths. One of their central claims is that their vacuums ""do not loose suction"". A reasonable question here is what happens when a dust canister fills up? Does it keep sucking dust and ejecting it back into the air? They also claim it is <i>the only</i> cyclonic vacuum (followed by some fine print), and this is simply not true.<p>All in all, it is really well marketed, but otherwise severly overpriced vacuum of an average manufacturing quality (can't lift certain portable models by their carrying handle, because some seal opens up and, ironically, they loose suction) and it was designed by an interesting person.

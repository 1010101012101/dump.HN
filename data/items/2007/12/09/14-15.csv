Even the least stressful of interruptions, assuming it uses the local state registers that are used in hacking, can completely scramble your brain. The friendliest of comments from co-workers, assuming they're about hacking (but not your project) and require hacking thinking, can ruin it, if the comment turns into a conversation that lasts more than 60 seconds. <p>It's not about stress. It's about juggling a bunch of delicate state, and the state is being held in short-term memory registers that are easily clobbered.",1197210658

In terms of coding, I find the cloud that comes from tiredness to be worth always avoiding. I do this because coding's not like moving lumber where you're just slower if you're tired. Instead you'll move the lumber to the wrong place! If I'm not at-peak, I dedicate that time to grunt-work, research, but not coding. My newest approach is personal ""sprints"" where I ignore all distractions, set a big goal and race at it for 1-2 hours.",1197210061

To me it would make sense if another term can be coined to refer to systems that have a GNU base, yet go against GNU's goals, yet still credit the GNU project for its contributions.  (I hope I'm not re-igniting the bad parts of the GNU/Linux debate).",1361822396
5281353,comment,5279307,5280040,5,0,scythe,,,"There are two things that come to mind when we ask if dietary fat causes obesity. First: fat and carbohydrates sum to <i>literally all of food</i>. The caloric value of protein is (essentially) negligible. What is certainly the case is that we can point to people who are fat (preferred term) on a low-fat diet. We can point to people who are fat on a fat-intermediate diet (rough balance of fat/carbs). Can we find many people who are fat on a low-carb diet?<p>I suggest that if we do, most such people will not be found eating fat in its natural form, but as rendered fat and pressed oil. It is almost certainly the case that the way in which fat is consumed affects satiety: the body cannot see a caloric benefit from fat until it is beta-oxidized in the liver, many hours after it is consumed. So in order to estimate how much you have eaten, <i>the body assumes you have consumed fats in their natural form</i>.<p>This is key to most low-carb diets: fat is usually consumed in its natural form, since nobody drinks oil (eww) and fatty snacks such as potato chips are banned. It is also an intrinsic feature of the ""paleo"" diets, which ban processed foods.<p>So, it might not be too much of a stretch to say that fat as a naturally occuring part of foods like almonds does not make us fat.<p>The second thing that comes to mind is the balance of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids in a healthy diet. When this is tilted excessively in favor of omega-6, the body produces an excess of certain endocannabinoids (arachidonic acid) which contribute to overeating:<p><a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/07/100726221737.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/07/100726221737.ht...</a><p>[NB: the mechanism is up in the air. The effect is real.]<p>The additional, final consideration is the alleged link (as stated in the article) between consumption of land meats and obesity. See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_meat#Obesity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_meat#Obesity</a><p>I've been harping on ""natural"", and meat is natural, so what gives? Weirder yet, the correlation is with meat <i>protein</i>, not with fats. And we do know, though, that people on e.g. ketogenic diets lose weight while eating lots of meat: <a href=""http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/82/1/1.short"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/82/1/1.short</a><p>The simplest way to assign blame is to cry confounding: while meat itself is natural, it is rarely consumed in a natural-food context. Instead, since meat is culturally considered unhealthy, it is often eaten on white bread or in a pack of Lunchables. Support for the confounding hypothesis would be a low r-value in studies that link meat consumption to body fat (i.e. total variation in body fat is only weakly related to variation in meat consumption); falsification might be a very high r-value, or a very well-controlled study.<p>[NB: I believe the confounding hypothesis.]",1361822381

Thistle was done by a summer intern in eight weeks and got us PHP FogBugz running on Unix for 8 weeks work, which almost doubled our potential market.<p>At the time, Fog Creek consisted of three people and one summer intern. We couldn't afford to rewrite all of FogBugz in some other language... even if there was a language (in 2003) that was reasonably portable between Windows and Unix, which there wasn't. (Yes, we considered PHP. That would still have been a full rewrite, and PHP on Windows was crappy and increased the system requirements in a way that our customers wouldn't have liked).<p>Yeah, a Lexus is better than a Camry, but not everyone can afford Lexuses. So saying ""you idiot, why are you driving that crappy car, it's obviously crappy"" is not particularly insightful... the question is, if you can get 90% of the bang for 10% of the bucks, that's a pretty good decision as a startup, even if it seems strange.<p>What's more interesting about the reaction is that so many average programmers seem to think that writing a compiler is intrinsically ""hard,"" or, as Jeff wrote in 2006, ""Writing your own language is absolutely beyond the pale."" To me this sounds like the typical cook at Olive Garden who cannot possibly believe that any chef in a restaurant could ever do something other than opening a bag from the freezer and dumping the contents into the deep fryer. Cooking? With ingredients? From scratch! Absolutely beyond the pale! Compilers aren't some strange magic black art that only godlike programmers are allowed to practice. They're something you learn how to create in one semester in college and you can knock out a simple one in a few weeks.

That breaks my own rule about absolutes.<p>I hadn't considered the routing of a CPU at compile time similar to the routing of an FPGA. They're at different scales and have different challenges... I guess it's because I have mainly seen FPGAs in time-critical situations (where CPUs can't be used) in which it was very difficult to predict their performance and they required lots of hand-tweaking. That was in SONET routing, btw. CPUs on the other hand, usually have some time to spare, whether it is because they are overspecced, or because they are used in applications which tolerate variation in execution time (user interfaces) in comparison to FPGAs used for e.g. translating data between communications busses. It is simple to measure, reproduce and predict specs for common algorithms like the FFT, convolution, etc. for CPUs. I believe this is because the operations in the ""routing"" of CPU algorithms are based on the sum of known, discrete, orthogonal events like memory fetches, ALU operations, etc.<p>Inside FPGAs though, the timing is not as uniformly discretized. It's about taking resources of routing distance from a large pool with a large geographical component, making it highly non-linear and tricky to predict.<p>I think we all agree a better language would be the key to getting more out of FPGA technology! And I would like to see more FPGA-elements on traditional CPUs like ARM, x86, AVR, PIC, etc. I wonder what elements an improved hardware description language would use? It could certainly be trivially parseable by tools like antlr while still giving bit-level access...<p>W/r/t additional hardware, I meant hardware that configures the bitstream, such as a header or CPU interface, as well as power supplies. For example, this schematic which I grabbed as an example: <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3f/WillWare_Usb_fpga_sch.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3f/WillWare_Usb_f...</a> . You can see the FPGA has THREE power supplies (1.2V, 2.5V, 3.3V). This particular design doesn't need additional clock sources, fortunately, but it's rather common. Understand that this isn't a fatal flaw with FPGAs, it's simply a disadvantage- one doesn't add an FPGA alone, one adds an FPGA, power supplies, possibly a crystal, and a programming interface. It means using an FPGA incurs a bunch of overhead.<p>As for getting my account banned due to my reaction to a bogus article about a way of multiplication fraudulently claimed to be taught to Japanese school kids: Well if you folks in this little community don't need me around and don't feel what I have to say counts for anything and you don't like the way I say what I have to say, and you can't tolerate differences in people who are different from you, then go ahead and enjoy gassing each other up and blowing smoke up each other's asses in your sealed-off little echo chamber without me.

Our entire team knew they were doing very little work, especially knowing one of the remote employees was maintaining a household with 4 children, and getting paid quite a bit more. One had the gall to ask us how to access source control very late in a project. Morale was clearly affected by those who had to come in every day and work their set 7.5 hours and had to make a case to stay home for the cable guy.<p>To make things fair, we really wish this blanket policy at Yahoo was put in effect, axed all remote arrangements, and reevaluate their remote arrangements on a case-by-case basis and bring fairness back without individually discriminating.<p>The reports of 'Yahoo is all against telecommuting' do not tell the entire story and are taking advantage of sensationalist headlining.

FPGAs certainly parallel pretty easily.  I wonder if your simplified optimum solution is to calculate one cell and replicate into 20x20 matrix or whatever you can fit on your FPGA and then have a higher level CPU sling work units and stitch overlapping parts together.<p>More practically I'd suggest your quick prototype would be slap a SoC on a FPGA that does it in your favorite low-ish level code, since it only takes hours, then very methodically and smoothly create an acceleration peripheral that begins to do the grunt-iest of the grunt work one little step at a time.<p>So lets start with just are there any connections at all?  That seems a blindingly simple optimization.  Well thats a bitwise comparison, so replace that in your code with a hardware detection and flag.  Next thing you know you've got a counter that automatically in hardware skips past all blank space into the first possible pixel... But thats an optimization, maybe not the best place to start.<p>Next I suppose if you're doing 4-connected you have some kind of inner loop that looks a lot like the wikipedia list of 4 possible conditions.  Now rather than having the on FPGA cpu compare if you're in the same region one direction at a time, do all 4 dirs at once in  parallel in VHDL and output the result in hardware to your code, and your code reads it all in and decides which step (if any) was the lowest/first success.<p>The next step is obviously move the ""whats the first step to succeed?"" question outta the software and into the VHDL, so the embedded proc thinks, OK just read one register to see if its connected and if so in which direction.<p>Then you start feeding in a stream and setting up a (probably painful) pipeline.<p>This is a solid bottom up approach.  One painful low level detail at a time, only one at a time, never more than one at a time.  Often this is a method to find a local maximum, its never going to improve the algo (although it'll make it faster...)<p>""because on FPGAs you are forced to optimize right from the start""  Don't do that.  Emulate something that works from the start, then create an acceleration peripheral to simplify your SoC code.  Eventually remove your onboard FPGA cpu if you're going to interface externally to something big, once the ""accelerator"" is accelerating enough.<p>Imagine building your own floating point mult instead of using an off the shelf one ... you don't write the control blocks and control code in VHDL and do the adders later... your first step should be writing a fast adder only later replacing control code and simulated pipelining with VHDL code.  You write the full adder first, not the fast carry, or whatever.",1361821040

They biased tests by e.g. replacing screws holding a rifle together with springs while they had custody of them before the official tests (or at least I've read that about the trials that selected the M14, the AR-10, original big brother of the AR-15, was said to be sabotaged that way).<p>The NRA never, <i>ever</i>, supported the ""assault weapons"" ban, with the sole exception of one off-script or trial balloon radio interview with Carleton Heston (take your pick, he and other Western actors cut commercials to support the passage of the Gun Control Act of 1968).  This was much noticed in the community because Clinton's AW ban <i>was the first piece of Federal anti-gun legislation that passed without the NRA's approval</i>, however grudging.<p>""<i>Accustomed to taking down trophy bucks with a hefty .30-caliber round, they ridiculed the AR-15 as a mouse gun and feared that its smaller .223-caliber bullet would only wound an animal, instead of taking it down with a single, clean shot.</i>""<p>A bit of an exaggeration, higher energy narrower than .30 caliber (7.62 mm) rounds have long been used to take deer sized animals.  Prior to recent tremendous developments in bullet technology .223 was iffy except for smaller critters, it was in fact derived from the .222 Remington, a target and varmint shooting cartridge, at least in the US.<p>Any correlation with the expiration of the 2004 ""assault weapons"" ban and the civilian market's response is bogus.  It was sufficiently weak that the only effect was an increase in the cost of magazines, and since it had been our issue rifle for a quarter century there were plenty used ones to be had.  Otherwise you could buy one as long as you were willing to forgo e.g. a bayonet lug....  I think the big event was 9/11, and the feckless domestic response, e.g. Bush telling us to go out and buy stuff to support the economy.  Many people realized they were on our own, at least in terms of initial response, and plenty of subsequent events like hurricanes emphasized that.  E.g. there's the saying that ""When seconds count, the police are minutes away"".  After a hurricane for many it will be more like weeks.<p>That Hello Kitty rifle is real, there are some very nice modern gun finishes that come in many different colors, like DuraCoat which was used for that one and which the article has a photograph of a SHOT Show advertising display for it.<p>I can't speak to the author's emphasis of all this coming from the gaming ""and others who had fallen into the post-9/11, SpecOps-inspired 'tactical lifestyle'"" ... but I'll note there wouldn't have been a 1994 ""assault weapons"" ban if these weren't already popular guns.

[...] Generally, EMGs are also recorded from some other part of the body, such as the forearm, where muscle activity should have no relevance for reading. In fact, normal skilled readers show little forearm activity during reading, while EMG activity in the speech tract increases markedly during reading in comparison to the baseline condition (where the subject sits quietly). In contrast, deaf readers show a considerable amount of forearm activity during reading (we shall see the reason for that later in this chapter).</i><p>[Page 211 - <a href=""http://goo.gl/R3NPT"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/R3NPT</a>]<p><i>That profoundly deaf people can read at all is sometimes taken as evidence that speech recoding in normal readers is optional. However, as we have seen, they do not read very well, and the best available evidence indicates that when reading English text deaf readers recode the printed information into their native language (ASL) for comprehension purposes. Since they have not experienced speech sounds, recoding into a phonological code is precluded from deaf readers. Instead, the information is recoded into a manual form to aid comprehension. The poor reading of deaf people is thus probably due in part to inner speech being a more efficient system of recoding than overt manual gestures.<p>Readers of logographic systems such as Chinese can probably access the meaning of many printed characters directly from the visual representation. However, associations between the printed word and the appropriate pronunciation are activated during reading and appear to be important in comprehending text.</i>",1361820112

If you can't remember that ""="" means assignment or that for loops need curly braces around them, you'll be in trouble, of course, but they'll help you with the details.<p>When it comes to REPL and the code-run-debug cycle, they usually ask you to explain how to code would run to them step-by-step, which simulates having a computer run it. They do the same and pipe up if you miss something. So it's not the same as running the code, but it's similar enough and it also shows how well you understand the code you're writing.<p>I do think that the major flaw of whiteboard interviews is that it does not show a programmer's ability to organize large amounts of code. In most programming, you won't be solving logic puzzles as much as organizing several parts and sticking them together. The organization is far more important in the long run than the individual code itself, especially since the code will likely be changed later on (which is made easier if it is well organized).",1361820079

5281058,comment,5278133,5280492,1,0,DrDreams,,,"Thanks for clearing up some of my blurrier points :)    I should not have included ""always"" in that statement about matching the density of silicon.  That breaks my own rule about absolutes.<p>I hadn't considered the routing of a CPU at compile time similar to the routing of an FPGA.  They're at different scales and have different challenges...   I guess it's because I have mainly seen FPGAs in time-critical situations (where CPUs can't be used) in which it was very difficult to predict their performance and they required lots of hand-tweaking.  That was in SONET routing, btw.  CPUs on the other hand, usually have some time to spare, whether it is because they are overspecced, or because they are used in applications which tolerate variation in execution time (user interfaces) in comparison to FPGAs used for e.g. translating data between communications busses.  It is simple to measure, reproduce and predict specs for common algorithms like the FFT, convolution, etc. for CPUs.  I believe this is because the operations in the ""routing"" of CPU algorithms are based on the sum of known, discrete, orthogonal events like memory fetches, ALU operations, etc.<p>Inside FPGAs though, the timing is not as uniformly discretized.  It's about taking resources of routing distance from a large pool with a large geographical component, making it highly non-linear and tricky to predict.<p>I think we all agree a better language would be the key to getting more out of FPGA technology!  And I would like to see more FPGA-elements on traditional CPUs like ARM, x86, AVR, PIC, etc.  I wonder what elements an improved hardware description language would use?  It could certainly be trivially parseable by tools like antlr while still giving bit-level access...<p>W/r/t additional hardware, I meant hardware that configures the bitstream, such as a header or CPU interface, as well as power supplies.  For example, this schematic which I grabbed as an example: <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3f/WillWare_Usb_fpga_sch.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3f/WillWare_Usb_f...</a>     You can see the FPGA has THREE power supplies (1.2V, 2.5V, 3.3V).  This particular design doesn't need additional clock sources, fortunately, but it's rather common.  Understand that this isn't a fatal flaw with FPGAs, it's simply a disadvantage- one doesn't add an FPGA alone, one adds an FPGA, power supplies, possibly a crystal, and a programming interface.  It means using an FPGA incurs a bunch of overhead.<p>As for getting my account banned due to my reaction to a bogus article about a way of multiplication fraudulently claimed to be taught to Japanese school kids:  Well if you folks in this little community don't need me around and don't feel what I have to say counts for anything and you don't like the way I say what I have to say, and you can't tolerate differences in people who are different from you, then go ahead and enjoy gassing each other up and blowing smoke up each other's asses in your sealed-off little echo chamber without me.

My point with the eprom anecdote was that you're stuck with closed source if you put a z80 core and some rom/ram/decode logic in a FPGA and do a synthetic SoC and merely avoiding FPGA and doin' it with discrete Z80 and eprom and sram and some glue isn't going to save you, because in 2013 using PC hardware you pretty much need a closed source windows only USB eprom programmer.  So if you're stuck with closed source doing a hobby project, at least do something ""cool"" and use the FPGA.<p>To do ""about the same thing"" but open source there are several completely open source alternatives that would result in CPU controlled I/O ports being wiggled.  Avoiding closed source is not just as simple as saying ""no FPGAs"" or closed source is solely a disease of FPGAs.  for example it took years as I recall before the Propeller had a non-windows/dos stack, although the BST works pretty well now.<p>Confusing the issue, if you just want to play around with Verilog as a language or abstract technology, Icarus is free software part of the GnuEDA project.  Obviously that's playing with simulation not silicon, but it is possible.  So you don't have to entirely avoid FPGA technology.",1361819406

5280927,comment,5276851,5277979,7,0,rsaarelm,,,"Keeping the game a purposefully obtuse niche thing might make sense, depending on the values of the developer. It's possible to not be interested growing the dev team creatively, like most novelists are perfectly happy just writing by themselves. Solo gamedev is cheap, you basically just need to feed yourself and be able to run a computer, so in case you just want to work on the game all day, a very modest wage has you covered there.<p>Extra money never hurts though, so why not try to grow as much as you can? Well, there's the thing of interacting with your player base, which might be the most interesting social interaction you get if you live and breathe the game. The more successful you grow, the bigger the player base grows and the bigger the status difference between you and a random player becomes.<p>If it's just you and a few dozen players, it's basically just a social hangout with you providing some interesting entertainment. If it's a few hundred players, it's no longer quite that, but it's still a manageable community where you can have discussions with people. Once things go big enough, the emergent community stuff isn't going to work anymore, and you might be too big of a deal yourself to be able to do random chat and not have things go weird. You might end up having to either get some people as community moderators (you wanted to develop a game full-time, not work as a manager, remember), or just go into radio silence and lose the social venue. And now working on the game is crappier than it used to be, like providing entertainment for a social hangout, but now you need an opaque wall between you and the other people who keep throwing beer bottles at you and each other, dismantling the furniture and lighting fires. So why were you doing this again?",1361819033

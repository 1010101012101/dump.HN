Because people like to pay license fees so much they will be all too eager to pay the fees for both h.264 encoding and flash?<p>Yes, businesses that already use h.264 and flash will probably continue using them. But the bootstrapped websites and startups will opt for the free stuff at least initially, and of all those bootstrapped startups some will be successful enough to make some noise. And then some of the established companies will have cost cutting rounds and will look at those license fees and think about whether they really need to pay them when some of their brand new competitors aren't paying them. At this point the iPhone will start looking bad for not supporting the newest and coolest video startups that are supported on android and Jobs will eventually cave too and add WebM support to the iPhone.<p>Everything in the web thus far has gone towards the lowest cost and easiest alternative that is still effective, and this will not be different.",1294786579

People are offended that computers can make investment decisions better than humans?  Computers making trades is not ""really"" investing?<p>Markets are based on trading.  If there are no trades, there are no markets.  If you want to buy 1000 shares of ABC company, and nobody has 1000 shares, guess what, the trade is not going to go through.  This is what will happen on a restricted market.<p>Similarly, high-frequency trading means price corrections occur more quickly, meaning that when you buy or sell security foo, it is more likely at the correct price.  Now you can argue that nobody really knows the correct price, but that is orthogonal.  (Computers make mistakes, but so do people.  There are some markets that are still not made on exchanges, and they are subject to the same whims that the equity markets are.  Computers are buggy.  People are irrational.)<p>My guess is that this market is for people with a lot of money that like to talk on the phone with bankers.

However, that doesn't necessarily mean that the studio is losing integrity.<p>As another commenter pointed out, Pixar rarely pumps out sloppy sequels -- while the motivation to make Toy Story 2 or 3 may be money initially, they make sure that the sequels have legitimate stories and are generally enjoyable. If they didn't, they would quickly become just-another-studio worth only the length of time they can trick parents into buying merchandise based on their intellectual property holdings.<p>Pixar doesn't do the straight-to-DVD sequel gig. Even when they continue a franchise, they aren't sloppy about it. Even if we aren't really big fans of the ""Cars"" style or humor, it's evident that there's at least a cohesive storyline and technical quality. Let's remember that Pixar makes cartoons -- usually, they easily skew to adults, but the more 8-year-old oriented Cars doesn't necessary mean that Pixar is losing it; it just means they're targeting 8-year-olds.",1294786190

In 3G, there is a significant energy consumption cost, when you send small amount of data regularly to server, because the network stack has to be changed to higher-energy mode each time you send something over TCP/IP.<p>Even if you stay in a same location and the location data doesn't changed, you might need to send the data to server. Why? To indicate freshness of the data, server has to pinged to indicate that location data is still fresh, even if it hasn't changed.

Trust me on that, Java was a breath of fresh air and it was obvious to everyone that it learned <i>a lot</i> from past languages.<p>> No, because it's not like Java was the first language to ponder about these, and it did not learn from previous languages (mistakes or successes). Pretty much all of Scala's improvements over Java predate Java itself by decades.<p>Maybe, but if these features had been put in Java in 1995, it's very unlikely it would have met the success it knows today.<p>Sometimes, the hard part in language design is knowing what feature <i>not</i> to add.

If you're applying to jobs not related to your degree, well, it's up to you. Cater your resume don't have a one size fits all resume. Is it worth your time though? What do you ultimately want to do? \nYes, some early stage startups hire interns. It's normally easier to get a job at a large company offering internships. That way, you get the corporate experience early and realize how much better it is to work for startups. \nIf you apply out of city, consider costs maybe. Generally, it's more fun and adventurous and you're isolated so you end up learning a lot more somehow. \nNegotiate payments when they tell you how much you're offered. Generally, if it's your 1st internship, you have no leverage to negotiate. \nFailed attempts should just be considered incomplete projects. Don't list them as experience.<p>Now, my personal advice is this: if you know what you enjoy doing, try and be a little picky. If you settle for any internship just for the experience, you may become experienced in something you don't enjoy doing.

I wonder if it's a concrete benefit of static typing to make you more aware of encapsulation: that does resonate with my experience.  Because functions and object methods have to have types that fit together, you're forced to think about what goes into and comes out of a given component, so you're thinking about component boundaries more often.<p>I know when writing a Ruby method it's all too easy to just return the first intermediate result that makes sense, subconsciously thinking ""let the caller process this result, and if it's messy I'll refactor it later"".  In Java, I have to write the return type <i>and also</i> return something, and if I planned to return an Iterable<String> but I'm tempted to return a List<Object>, the redundancy catches me out.  I have to consciously make the decision: should I change the contract of this method by changing the return type, or should I instead massage the results into the form I planned to return?<p>(I think the same holds for Scala, where I might not have to <i>write</i> the return type because it's inferred: if anything actually calls my method, the compiler will still remind me that the assumptions made at the call site don't line up with the assumptions made in the method.  In Ruby, although I'll still have to change the caller if I change the return type, I'm more likely to do it mechanically, in a ""I changed that so I have to change this"" mindset, rather than stepping back a level and thinking ""which one of these is actually right?"".)",1294783601

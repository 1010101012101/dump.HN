I can't even stream an XVID movie from a shared folder on my desktop to my laptop without it skipping every few seconds, and it doesn't matter what share protocol I'm using... or even if I'm using wireless.

329571,comment,329537,329537,0,0,furiouslol,,,"Here is my experience. I used Rails for one project of mine that requires processing of millions of data rows. Because the Rails ORM create an object for each data row, we end up using a lot of memory. We had to get a 2GB memory server to hold up the project. Even after we avoided the ORM (which removes the pleasure of coding in Rails), the memory usage was still high.<p>Sure, we could process the data rows outside of Rails in C but because the processing of data rows is an integral part of the project, that would mean coding 80% in C and 20% in rails. Not exactly an enjoyable experience.<p>So we rewrote it in PHP and avoid objects and use just functions and hashes/arrays. And it worked very well for us. The site render time drops from 0.8s to 0.03s. Memory usage rarely exceeds 100MB.",1223710460
329570,comment,329062,329521,0,0,tdavis,,,"<i>If you're looking there for in-depth analysis, you're always going to be disappointed.</i><p>Quite the contrary; I want TC to report start-up news. That's it. I don't want any editorials, op-eds, or analysis. Why? Because, as many <i>many</i> articles including this one prove, they are nearly always completely ignorant of the situation and say ridiculously stupid shit as a result.<p>They do that well, as you said, but it's when they go beyond the bare necessities and actual facts into the realm of ""analysis"" that the writers (and editors and everyone else between an article and my face) fall flat on their asses and cause my blood pressure to rise in the process.<p><i>""Shit, I can't swim. I know I can't. So you know what I do? I stay my black ass outta the pool.""</i>",1223710371
329569,comment,329023,329501,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Well, I'd say that whether or not life during WWII might was worse than during the depression is a very complex question, and you'd get very different answers from different people at the time. It was clearly a lot better for some, a lot worse for some, etc.<p>Even if it was worse overall, it gave us an economy and nation afterward that was far better than before the Great Depression. It is, of course, impossible to say where we'd be without it today, but things like the GI Bill greatly educating the American workforce or women entering it significantly undoubtedly changed us for the better.<p>The ramifications of that war are so complex that we're still finding new ones, but I was just pointing out that it is generally considered the end of the Depression, and much of the reason for our following prosperity.",1223710107

However, if you trying to get off to a good start, you might want simplistic examples.<p>One thing I think helps you become a better programmer, is to read your own code carefully a long time after you have written it.",1223709816

I already wrote TC off as a waste of my time along with things like valleywag quite some time ago, so I could easily be ignorantly biased, but for me I'd describe them as mainly being ""good"" at link-baity bullshit titles + wild trollish theories about what could happen presented as fact press release style to stir up interest... I'm sure they have some value, but it all comes down to that magical signal-to-noise ratio question... and this article here doesn't appear so bad but also doesn't seem very good either....",1223709310

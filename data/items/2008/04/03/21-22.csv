They're middleware that the client expects to integrate with existing systems (paying huge consulting bills in the process, though they may not know it yet).<p>Agreed. Tools to abstract workflow can be useful. My impression is that whether middleware tools to abstract workflow can be useful depends largely on how well they integrate with the overall toolset being used. Ours works because it's fully embedded in the tools. Standalone solutions may or may not work. I'm hearing good early returns from a friend using Microsoft WF in an all-Microsoft shop, but (1) it's still too soon to tell whether it's really a success, and (2) solving the all-MS solution is a much smaller problem than a universal workflow engine or even a general-purpose Java workflow engine.<p>> Sooner or later the vendor decides that their in-house framework is so great that they've really solved the problem of enterprise software development in general. Now they ""just"" need to package it up as a platform.<p>Actually, we're exactly at the point of trying to figure out whether our tools useful to VARs and client-level users, or whether it's really only useful to us.

I'm very happy with the abstractions I'm able to layer on top of them with macros.<p>One thing it took me a while to realize about the Lisp world is why there tends not to be standard frameworks or libraries for some of this stuff. The answer is that, for certain kinds of problems (basically, anything involving metaprogramming), it's actually easier to solve your problem yourself than to learn someone else's framework and then use it to solve your problem.  A good example would be unit testing... there are probably a dozen unit testing frameworks, none standard, none much used. The reason is that the frameworks don't add much value over what a programmer can easily do for himself, with all the advantages that implies. I think this may also be why web app frameworks are less prominent in the Lisp world.<p>This is not the case with all libraries, of course.

""But to put it up against Demo means those companies are now going to be competing for attention, and I just don't see how that's good for entrepreneurs.""<p>Actually it gives entrepreneurs value by letting them choose between spending $0 for, say, half the attention formerly held at Demo, or by paying Demo's fees for half the attention formerly held at Demo.<p>Sounds great for entrepreneurs, terrible for Demo. ;-)<p>> Still, she suggested Arrington's assertion that Demo needs to die is unfortunate.<p>> ""I'm not certain why it must die,"" Shipley said. ""I think that there is a lot of room in the market for products and services that support entrepreneurs. And I don't see how it's a benefit to (the entrepreneurial ecosystem) to kill off a platform that's all about supporting entrepreneurs.""<p>Hey, that's exactly the opposite of her previous argument!  What is the word for when a hypocrite hypocritically uses different standards for different people in similar situations, in a hypocritical manner?  Oh, yes:  <i>hypocrisy.</i>",1207256474

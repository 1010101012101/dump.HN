8576,comment,8411,8489,0,0,far33d,,,"This package is really interesting. I originally was drawn to django for a few reasons: it was really well documented, it had a good use history, is all python, and was basically full-stack and took care of the annoyances on the front end (templates) and back end (database). <p>But this suite of tools (pylons + mako + others) seem more flexible.. thanks for the advice. <p>I think I'll still investigate rails, but I have reservations.

8574,comment,8403,8467,0,0,far33d,,,"5%? Really? There's a huge class of young entrepreneurs, who have limited financial requirements (notice, I'm not using the word desires), and slightly older hackers who have greater requirements (car/house/etc) but probably have worked long enough to supplement the YC income with their own stock options, savings, etc. <p>If you really want to build something new and interesting, you should be willing to make financial sacrifices to make it happen. If you're comfortable, you probably won't be as hungry.

They're in a hurry.""<p>This paragraph really spoke to me. Does anybody else feel this way? I am a 3rd-yr. undergrad, and I'm itching to finish school and start a company. <p>I study Computer Science, and I love it, and I would love to continue studying it in graduate school. I could apply for a PhD, but then I would be putting my life off for another 4-7 yrs. I could apply for a Master's in C.S., but then I would be putting my life of for another 2 years.<p>I feel that school sometimes creates a disillusioned sense of learning among students. I have to constantly remind myself that I could learn anything I've learned in school on my own time, and that I can continue to do so even after I graduate, and even after I retire.<p>This isn't true of a lot of people. School certainly offers a strong sense of competition, along with access to bright students and accomplished faculty. I feel like each semester is an orgy of learning, if you will, in which I am focused and determined to intensely work and succeed. But during winter and summer breaks, there is not much difference...<p>I love to learn and would love to continue school, but in a sense, it restricts you to its curriculum. Perhaps my interests are simply more business-oriented. Perhaps I am afraid to face up to the possible rejection of graduate school. Regardless, I don't want to feel like I am putting of my life any longer.<p>Anybody else with me?",1175621723

Combining the two lets you do things that you can't do just with lambdas, and if you want to make an argument as to why blocks are flexible that's the right argument to make.  For example, to wrap file access in the appropriate open/close functionality while still letting you return early via the block.<p>Unfortunately, it can also result in some serious confusion on the part of a programmer that wants to think of them as lambdas.  Java was originally going to do something similar and have two types of lambdas in 1.7, one using => and the other using ==> to indicate the non-local return semantics, and I think it would have confused a ton of people.<p>If you have a filter that takes a predicate function, for example, you might naively do (excuse my incredibly-rusty-and-thus-totally-syntatically-mangled-Ruby):<p>some_list.filter() |x| do\n  if (x.foo)\n    return true\n  else\n    return false\nend<p>In this case, you'll end up returning from the outer function, NOT just returning a true/false value for filtering.  To do that, you have to just do:<p>some_list.filter() |x| do\n  if (x.foo)\n    true\n  else\n    false\nend<p>And rely on the way that things you might otherwise think of as statements are expression values in Ruby.  But what if my predicate function is really complicated, and I want to end the block early?  Um . . . too bad.  Better put that in its own function and call <i>that</i> function from your block.<p>I'm sure that in practice those aren't major issues for people used to Ruby idioms and behavior, but from someone new to Ruby they can really trip you up.",1271442313

So I just decided to make a system that let me track what I drank, give it a rating, and then follow others.  Not rocket science.<p>There are plenty of beer rating sites on the internet (Beer Advocate, RateBeer, etc) but they can often be intimidating to newbies and they really only encourage one rating of a given beer (and require a relatively substantial review).  My concept was to keep it simple so that users will keep rating their beer.  If a Beer Advocate rating is like a blog, then a HopChart rating is like a tweet.  And so that has become my concept.  Keep it simple.<p>I started this site because I had a lull in work and because it was something that I wanted to use.  I've ended up spending a bit more time and effort on it then I had intended and now I'm trying to figure out if I should keep it where it is or take it a bit further.  The problem is I'm in a state of paralysis by analysis.  I honestly don't know what direction to go.  I have a number of things (including iphone app, foursquare integration) in the pipeline but I'm afraid of investing more time/money/effort if I don't know what the ultimate goal is.  One of my shortcomings is not spending enough time marketing it, I've given myself the excuse that I don't know exactly what I'm building yet...lame I know.  Another shortcoming is not making use of the data I have for building a good recommendation engine.<p>So now the advice part.  What would you do if you were in my shoes?

Had ACA known, they would have been far less likely to be willing to enter into the deal.<p>Goldman: <i>“One thing that we need to make sure ACA understands is that we want their name on this transaction.  This is a transaction for which they are acting as portfolio selection agent, this will be important that we can use ACA’s branding to help distribute the bonds.”</i><p>ACA: <i>“I certainly hope I didn’t come across too antagonistic on the call with Fabrice [Tourre] last week but the structure looks difficult from a debt investor perspective. I can understand Paulson’s equity perspective but for us to put our name on something, we have to be sure it enhances our reputation.”</i>",1271442150

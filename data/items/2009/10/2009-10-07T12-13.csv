I understand that with modern technology, things can happen faster, sometimes much faster.  But how does spending 3 days determining that a business is not viable constitute a failure?<p>I really hate the whole ""failure is OK"" meme.  Sure, we all understand that not everything goes perfectly all the time.  But we also have those ""Is this really worth it?"" moments.  For some of us, this happens all the time - the harder the project, the more often if happens.  Sometimes all that separates <i>real success</i> from <i>real failure</i> is pushing through these moments, determined not to allow speed bumps to stop you.<p>I'm not suggesting that we will never fail or that we should never give up; sometimes that <i>does</i> make sense.  I am suggesting that success is elusive until we adopt a personal policy of ""failure is not an option"".<p>OP was not a failure and not an example of this.<p>Failure is not OK.",1254920162

You know nothing about them, save for the IQ of each. Will you choose the surgeon with the lower IQ? What if the difference between them is an entire standard deviation? Two standard deviations? If you truly believe that IQ tests measure <i>nothing</i> - that the result of any such test is essentially a random number - you should happily choose the surgeon with the lower score. If you do not believe it, we are merely quibbling over the accuracy of existing tests.<p>Moreover, the only way to seriously dismiss the existing IQ tests as hopelessly inaccurate is to borrow tricks from the Creationists' playbook wholesale (as Steven Jay Gould, the patron saint of IQ denial, often did) and close your eyes (and more importantly, those of your audience) to reams of high-quality data.<p>More references, for those actually interested:

For example's sake, let's say you've been trading stock off a tip a company insider gave you, which is illegal. At the same time, you don't know it's illegal, but you are consciously trading the stock.<p>Intent -- You have the intent to trade the stock because you are doing it during the day, awake and fully aware of your actions. You would not have intent if you traded the stock while sleepwalking.<p>Awareness of the law -- You are not aware that your actions are a crime, despite having an intent to perform those actions. This makes no difference -- you are held accountable for your actions whether you knew they were illegal or not, as long as you were cognizant while you were taking those actions.<p>IANAL, so again, the language is probably all flubbed.

866558,comment,865918,866059,0,0,btilly,,,"Um, no.  Your advice is completely backwards.<p>Perl does NOT have a lightweight threading model.  Period.  Literally every time you spawn a thread, Perl copies all of its data structures to avoid sharing stuff that is not threadsafe.  If your Perl developers try to tell you otherwise, they are incompetent.  The standard way to build a high performance website in Perl is to use prefork and then put a reverse proxy in front of them in httpd accelerator mode.  See <a href=""http://perl.apache.org/docs/1.0/guide/strategy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perl.apache.org/docs/1.0/guide/strategy.html</a> for an old, but still accurate, description of httpd accelerator mode if you don't know what it is.<p>Please note that Windows does not have good support for forking.  Therefore I have never heard of a competent team of Perl developers choosing to try to deploy a high volume website on Windows.<p>To the best of my knowledge both Ruby and Python do support lightweight threading, unlike Perl, but both have a global interpreter lock that synchronizes very frequently, and severely limits scalability.  I don't know what strategies are common in those languages, but personally I suspect that the right strategy on Unix with those languages is, like Perl, to use pre-fork with a reverse proxy in httpd accelerator mode.<p>However both Python and Ruby have implementations on other platforms, such as the JVM.  I <i>believe</i> (verify this before relying on it) that those implementations support lightweight threads without the drawbacks of the C implementation.  Therefore if you want to use lightweight threading with that class of scripting language, use one of those implementations.",1254918044

It is also helpful for me to realize web surfing isn't all necessarily wasted time and can actually be quite valuable.<p>Also, in the spirit of the article:<p>I found this at lifehacker.com.  Besides the regular sites, such as proggit, hn, & /., I also semi-regularly check boingboing.net, makezine.com/blog, hackaday.com, aldaily.com, tcsdaily.com, and my old undergrad tutors' site: scriptoriumdaily.org.<p>boingboing, makezine, and hackaday all go together.  They focus on hacks, makezine and hackaday on the tech side and boingboing more on the cultural side.<p>aldaily and tcsdaily also go together, aldaily represents the humanities side of academia and tcsdaily represents the business/tech side of academia; though both are written informally.<p>The last one is written from a Christian perspective, but I usually find the articles to be pretty insightful, and if you are an atheist and don't get all these religious wingnuts you might get a better idea of what makes the more reasonable ones tick.",1210909920

D dissertation where he describes Connection Machine is quite interesting to read (as far as Ph D dissertations go!).<p>Bit of trivia - the CMs were programmed in Lisp. Why Lisp?<p>As per Danny Hillis: ""Lisp was chosen... for a combination of technical and social reasons. On the technical side, Lisp is extensible, has dynamic storage allocation, and is generally good for symbol manipulation. In addition, excellent Lisp programming environments already exist. On the sociological side, most members of the AI community, for whom the Connection Machine was originally designed, are already familiar with Lisp"".",1210908468

Python for slightly slower but faster coding.<p>For an GUI program use C++ (qt is a good toolkit).<p>For Web Pages learn html/css and then add javascript. After that I would say mysql (or postgresql.

It's a ""feature"" of the architecture pg used to build the site (continuations based).<p>So, if you sit idle on any of the comment pages for more than a few minutes it becomes unavailable.  You have to start over on the main page and dig your way back down.

191382,comment,191228,191228,0,0,nazgulnarsil,,,"most hackers are already anarchistic and or libertarians so it isn't surprising that we think Ayn Rand is bullshit.  We're already individualistic and questioning of the status quo.  But for people whom aren't like this Ayn Rand can be an important author to read.  For example women tend to be more caring and communal instead of selfish and rational.  It doesn't surprise me that successful business women really like Atlas Shrugged.   They need to hear a justification for the pursuit of selfish aims moreso than a libertarian does.<p>The things that hit close to home but are slightly off bother people a lot more than things from left field.  evangelical christians touting their creationist museum bothers me more than muslims beating women, even though the latter is worse.  The evangelicals are in my backyard.  Likewise libertarians are bothered by Rand because she espouses some of our ideals but horribly twists others.",1210907411

191378,comment,190824,190824,0,0,greatreorx,,,"""When you enter the game, you are assuming that you are better than at least half of the other players.""<p>I think the difference is - at what point does that assumption become atleast somewhat provable. Shaquille O'Neal was probably an athletic 6'10"" 280 lbs in high school.  Just because the game of basketball itself is zero sum, does that make it irrational to think that he would become a decent professional basketball player?<p>My favorite part of Taleb's book is when he describes the investing world as if all player's had a random 50/50 shot of making money each year.  There are millions of investors, by random chance thousands will do really well, a handful will do really, really well over the course of decades.  How do you know Warren Buffet is not part of that handful that is successful purely by chance?  It's been awhile since I've read the book, but I remember his philosophy being something like if you have a logical investing/hypothesis that gets proven results, then maybe we can say it's not by chance.<p>So to answer your question, if you think you have an objective theory/algorithm/etc for option trading and have done blind historical tests or have successfully paper traded for a year+, then you might be on to something. If you think you are just smarter than everybody else, or maybe had a couple successful stock trades, it's probably not a good idea.",1210907163

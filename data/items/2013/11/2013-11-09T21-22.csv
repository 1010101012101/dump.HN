He&#x27;s an artist, and he wisely saw that the crass commercialization of his beloved creations would, in the long run, reduce their nostalgic value. Hell, maybe he isn&#x27;t even thinking in that way. In any case, I think it&#x27;s possible that C&H holds such a special place in our consciousness because of Watterson&#x27;s reluctance to license his characters, and <i>good for him</i>.<p>Now imagine a situation in which a hard-working t-shirt maker puts the images of C&H on shirts -- shirts for which he risks a tremendous amount of capital to produce -- and makes a boatload of money selling $8 t-shirts? Is Watterson harmed financially? For some people, the answer is &quot;No&quot;, because Watterson was not making money off of C&H t-shirts in the first place. And copying static images certainly doesn&#x27;t remove them from Watterson&#x27;s possession.<p>Yet I would argue again that Watterson&#x27;s artistic intent has been damaged...and that even though he hasn&#x27;t been <i>physically</i> robbed, a well-intentioned t-shirt maker has watered down the value of Watterson&#x27;s creation.<p>Is this not the same situation as the OP here? Is it different because Nintendo is a big corporation that should be doing better things with its time? Perhaps...size does matter. But the principle is arguably the same, and for anyone to say that Nintendo is going overboard and doesn&#x27;t need to protect its intellectual property, that requires making a huge assumption about Nintendo&#x27;s strategy on how it wishes Mario Bros. to be experienced, same as it&#x27;s a huge assumption to say that Bill Watterson doesn&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s doing when he refuses to license the use of C&H.<p>More context. This is Watterson&#x27;s opinion on turning C&H into a film:<p><a href=""http://www.salon.com/2013/10/17/calvin_and_hobbes_creator_bill_watterson_gives_rare_interview/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.salon.com/2013/10/17/calvin_and_hobbes_creator_bi...</a><p>> <i>Watterson also confirmed that an animated Calvin and Hobbes movie wont happen:</i>

Its inevitable, because different media have different strengths and needs, and when you make a movie, the movies needs get served. As a comic strip, Calvin and Hobbes works exactly the way I intended it to. Theres no upside for me in adapting it.</i><p>Watterson is incredibly protective of his own creation, so far as to not even give Pixar -- legendary artists in their own right -- a chance to entertain millions of people with the goodness of C&H.

There&#x27;s no real difficulty in breaking things up across two lines versus typing any other extra character (this touches on another issue, which is that I am of the opinion that the concept of code brevity estimation by line count comparison is fundamentally flawed, as code with fewer wider lines is often just cumbersome to type as code with more narrower lines).<p>That said, please consider the following:<p>data Color = Red | Black<p>data Color { Red; Black }<p>data Color = Red | Black | Green<p>data Color { Red; Black; Green }<p>I think the brace + semicolon-newline style actually compares pretty favorably on single-line width (it wins out on line width to an increasing degree as the line gets longer, which is important). However, it is visually more complex, which matters a lot for shorter lines. For this reason, I think that allowing both syntaxes would be ideal. The pipe-based syntax could be encouraged for single lines (newline-termination would sidestep block-end inference issues), with the curly brace based syntax being encouraged for multi-line definitions. There is a slight disadvantage in that now a user would have to know both syntaxes, of course.<p>edit:<p>Of course, since Pyret&#x27;s syntax requires that ADT parameters be specified in parentheses, you can actually omit the pipes in single-line mode, too, and opt to use space-juxtaposition.",1384031353

That was the end of that.<p>Even if somehow the whole world were to switch instantaneously to the state of anarchy, it would be a very short matter of time before someone internally decided to take over and enforce rules with the threat of violence.

Then, there are emergent or natural systems, such as gravity. These cannot be changed simply because people decide they don&#x27;t like them.<p>Capitalism is of the latter category. It is not a human-created system; it did not emerge from colonialism. It is merely the natural emergent behavior of actors under resource scarcity. As long as there are not enough resources for everyone to have what they want, there will be some variant of a market and capitalistic trade. It is not possible to alter this scenario simply because it doesn&#x27;t seem pleasant; that&#x27;s wishful thinking. All that can be done is to make the market more or less efficient.<p>The Soviet Union and North Korea, for example, have always had internal capitalist black markets, despite massive penalties. Prisons have internal black markets. Countries that try to control their currency&#x27;s value have massive internal black markets for hard currency. Cocaine is readily available for a price almost everywhere in the world, despite massive and coordinated efforts to suppress that market.<p>The reverse also applies; in the absence of actual scarcity, it is impossible to enforce a market, since that is an emergent property of scarcity rather than a human-chosen system. Illegal music and movie trading online, for example, continue to grow despite massive efforts to prop up the market, because there is no actual scarcity.",1384031289

Experimenting with humans is very difficult, and certain types of experiments are downright impossible. Thus, effects of foods that do are not immediate and drastic are very hard to determine in human experiments.<p>Think about a food that we now know is very dangerous: trans fats. Humans had been eating trans fats for about 80 years when they were definitely found to cause heart attacks. Only then there was enough data to make a definite connection. And while there were some scientific articles that suggested a connection in the 60&#x27;s someone could always say &quot;there is no definite proof.&quot; Many people died of heart attacks before the statistics became such that a connection was obvious.<p>Then there is the tendency of people to wrongly assume that compounds that are kind of similar will have the identical effect on the body. Thus, for a long time carbohydrates were all bunched together because they were very similar molecules. People would often say that carbohydrates cannot be bad for you because humans have been eating rice and wheat for centuries without negative effects. But it turned out that fructose is a little different than other carbohydrates and it can be bad for you.<p>And then there is the fact that the same thing can be benign or very dangerous depending on what form it is in. Thus, fructose is absolutely benign when eaten as part of a fruit or vegetable, but quite harmful when eaten in a refined sugar or high fructose corn syrup form.<p>So I am very very suspicious of any food additives. The only rational decision for a human being is to eat the type of foods humans have eaten for tens of thousands of years before and for which our bodies have evolved. Maybe MSG is benign. Or maybe it is actually bad for you. I would prefer not to become one of those statistics that allows scientists to prove many years from now that MSG is indeed bad for you.<p>MSG is especially worrying because there are some studies that show negative effects of MSG and the fact that other studies show no effects does not quite negate these.

324381,comment,324315,324315,0,0,shafqat,,,"This is a great read, and highlights a common thought circulating in the media industry: investigative journalism is dying because of cost cutting in newsrooms. But that is exactly the kind of journalism that can save newspapers. Rather than focusing on keeping the main thing the main thing, newspapers are effectively cutting off their oxygen supply.<p>On a note related to my startup (NewsCred), I found it very interesting that the author could empirically prove that trust in a newspaper directly leads to increased ad rates and circulation.",1223243979
324380,comment,323850,323850,0,0,lacker,,,"This title is pretty misleading. The author claims that inflation is ""implicitly repudiating debt"". This is really not how the phrase ""repudiating debt"" is used.<p>Nobody is too surprised when the dollar suffers inflation. But it would be shocking if the U.S. <i>actually</i> refused to honor T-bills.<p>Also, the devaluation of the dollar is hardly new. The dollar has been weakening vs the euro since early 2006.<p><a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/currency/convert?from=USD&to=EUR&amt=1&t=5y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://finance.yahoo.com/currency/convert?from=USD&to=EU...</a><p>Don't get me wrong, inflation is bad, and it hurts the poor who are honestly trying to save the worst. But it isn't the end of the world. It's not even nearly as bad as the 70's, inflation-wise. The real danger is in the hard-to-predict ""black swan"" disasters that could still happen.",1223243897

Or maybe not ""more"", but different things that schooling may not focus on. (and I'll be able to return in a few years)<p>In this time I do what I want with my time (OK most of the time, I still have to do free lance to pay the bills), I don't just learn things, but I learn what I need to do for the task I'm trying to do.<p>Founding a startup isn't a priority for me, but if the idea comes along then thats great. :)",1223243760

Does he come at the problem from a left-wing or right-wing perspective?<p>In my experience, academic leftism is seen as more of a social obligation than a set of deeply-held beliefs.

You also have a lot of private capital being lost, that never went through Fannie or Freddy.<p>AIG is not goverment's mess.  They decided to insure insane amount of CDO, which are not regulated, and being used not for hedging, more like bets in the market. Lehman Bros/Bear Stearn are not governments mess. They decided to leverage themselves at an absurd 1/30+ ratio.\nThe goverment has been staying away from them, and look what happened.<p>Also, if you noticed, that there are banks that are actually doing really good, mainly because were smart enough to stay away from this madness.<p>And there have also been major crashes  (1929, or 1873) where the gov. was almost non-existent, and the dollar was backed by gold.<p>For some reason, just like in reddit,  there is always post ""Blame the goverment about everything for over-regulating"".<p>How about blaming the individuals for taking too much credit card debt, and too many loans(may they be greedy or stupid), and the people that led these companies to ruin for once.",1223243466

324371,comment,324299,324349,0,0,jmtame,,,"The US is going to need to go through a complete meltdown.  A Great Depression probably wouldn't make people angry and organized enough to cause the change that we need.<p>My prediction is that the United States won't stick around for too long (if you take a history textbook perspective on this, which you can see other failed societies have made the same mistakes that we are now repeating).<p>I think we have a fighting chance to create the desirable society that eliminates corporatocracy.  Did you know the planet contains 13,000 zettajoules of geothermal energy?  The entire world uses 0.5 zettajoules of energy per year.  And we can harvest this, but there are patent wars to suppress this from easily happening.<p>Let's look at the other resources available, which cost us nothing at all.  Wind?  3 states of wind energy can power the entire United States.  Water?  The UK alone could be powered by water/tide energy alone.  Solar?  One hour of thermal energy in the day could power the United States for an entire year if we harvested it properly.<p>Travel by plane?  Who does that when you could travel by AT3's mag-lev trains, which can reach speeds up to 4,000 MPH with zero moving parts and zero emissions.  Oh, and it uses about 10% of the energy of an airplane.  Yes, they work in land and water.<p>What happens when technology replaces humans?  You no longer need to work.  In our capitalistic society, it's called unemployment.  If you look into the Venus Project, it's called you get bored and start thinking about space exploration.<p>Once people figure out that we don't really need these corporations, we'll never have this type of problem come up again.  The corporations are holding us back and creating scarcity (real or perceived) at every opportunity.  Like I said, I don't think the United States is going to get it right, we're in far too deep over our heads.  And the attitudes and apathy of the American people never ceases to amaze me (in a bad way) as an undergraduate.",1223243248

324368,comment,323616,323772,0,0,hugh,,,"OK, firstly, if this is what ""neo-con"" means to you then the word is sufficiently broad to have lost all meaning.<p>Secondly, I'm guessing this has more to do with broader demographic trends. Since the 1970s there's been a huge increase in the number of people who go to university, so a university-educated person has a broader pool of other university-educated people to choose from.<p>Even more importantly, while in the distant past there were significantly more men going to university than women (and as such there weren't enough educated women to go around), in recent decades the numbers have been more or less equal (though recently women have been overtaking men).",1223243091

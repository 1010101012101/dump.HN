Benefits that ""we"" have voted for, with our dollars, time and again.<p>Now, if ""we"" are ""consumers in general"", ""we"" can simply choose not to buy Apple products if we don't like them.

4390925,comment,4390343,4390343,3,0,terhechte,,,"I decided I'm leaving Gmail at some point in the future, here's why: Yesterday I wanted to comment on a video on Youtube. I clicked the 'reply' button, and a message came up, telling me that I needed to create a YouTube channel (or something) on order to be able to comment. So I quickly filled the mandatory fields and hit save. The next thing I saw was a message from Google telling me that my account had been locked because I am under 13 years of age. My Gmail account! My account where I have all my precious data. Because I had a typo in a field somewhere on YouTube!
I understand that the US law requires these things, but why on earth would a typo on YouTube kill my personal Email account?
Now I uploaded an image of my passport onto their servers to proof that I'm over 13. If that doesn't work out, they'll delete <i>all my data</i> in 29 days.<p>I can't explain how fed up I am about that. 
When I'm entering any date fields on my Gmail account, I'm always cautious. But this was YouTube. Enough rant.<p>Thanks for this tool! When my account comes back up, I'll use it to keep the data safe (I do have it in imap of course). And then at some point in the future I'll look for an alternative to Google.",1345121741

For some reason I thought it would be used once then thrown away (how naive of me.)  It felt a little inappropriate to say the least.  I felt my addressbook had been mysteriously revealed.

It greatly helps to understand the difference between the heap and the stack, and to understand the difference between static and dynamic allocation.<p>Functions in C are ""pass by value"" rather than ""pass by reference"". To simulate ""pass by reference"", the ""value"" you would pass is the memory address of the data in question, ie the pointer.<p>Also, if you put data on the heap, you must keep a reference to its memory address, otherwise you wont be able to access it again. You use a pointer for this. The following bit of code allocates some space on the heap, sticks an integer (5) on it and then returns a reference to that memory address, which is stored in a pointer variable named x.<p><pre><code>  int * x = new int(5);
</code></pre>
To understand why you would do the above instead of ""int x = 5"", you really need to understand what the stack and heap are, and why/when to
use them.<p>Also, you can create read-only versions of variables this way. Eg:<p><pre><code>  int x = 5;
  const int * y = &x;
</code></pre>
At this point, y points to the address containing x, but can only be used to read. printing out ""x"" and ""* y"" will both give you the same result. If you want to update it, you can do ""x=6"", but ""* y=6"" will cause a compile time error, because of the const.<p>There are probably loads of other uses too. I only started learning C/C++ last month, in my spare time. Hmm, I seem to have learnt a few things.",1345118431

Protocol Buffers are crazy fast but aren't self describing or human readable.</i><p>Why does that matter? The fact that they aren't self-describing more or less requires that you use a published message definition, which solves one of the major problems of XML schemas -- nobody actually uses them, and many that do use them incorrectly.<p><i>XML is great for what it is, and it has its drawbacks, but as a universal transport it is pretty rad.</i><p>Having wasted far too much of my life on parsing XML documents, I simply can not agree.<p>XML as a universal transport just sucks compared to the modern alternatives.",1262325559

1025495,comment,1025232,1025452,0,0,metajack,,,"Even with a binary format, you'd be sending data out of band in XMPP. XMPP is designed for interchanging _small_ bits of data. Large data blocks destroy latency, so they are usually sent out of band.<p>Plenty of large data blocks occur without any binary file transfers, like disco items responses from large services.<p>The solution to this problem isn't a binary encoding of XMPP, it's multiple simultaneous streams. The problem exists regardless of the encoding. Some of the solutions for this set up internal streams (In-band bytestreams and in-band Jingle are two examples). Since well defined protocols already exist for voice/video and other such things, those are used when possible. This isn't a bad thing. No technology needs to do everything itself.<p>Also, the complexity of out-of-band protocols in XMPP has nothing at all to do with XML. It has to do with NATs and firewalls. It is not easy to set up peer-to-peer communication on the Internet that actually works. SIP and RTP and their ilk are quite complex, I agree.  Jingle also has many simple out-of-band and in-band set ups you can use as well, but they aren't nearly as complete or flexible.",1262324856

No just certain workplaces, but over the entire workforce.  That really is a moment to pause for reflection.<p><i>It then proceeds to state certain deficencies</i><p>Right.  When the average of a bunch of things is 50%, then some of them are lower than 50% and some of them are higher.  (Or they're all exactly 50%, but in super complex situations like human behavior that never actually happens.)<p><i>Wait-- go back. There will soon be 2 million more women in higher education than men? How does the author just skip over that?</i><p>The author doesn't.  The author says that there will be more middle class women with jobs, but fewer poor women with jobs.  He/she wants to help the poor ones.<p>He/she also points out that, while they're in the work force, they make less money, and provides evidence that this is because they take time off to raise children.  He/she thinks its a detriment to society overall when a woman, who is equally capable as a man, makes less money just because she has a gap in her resume.  That's not inconsistent.<p><i>It seems like placing your fingers in your ears and going ""Na na na na.""</i><p>Restating your point with a visceral image doesn't make it any more true.<p><i>I felt like there was some deliberate cognitive dissonance going on there.</i><p>You mean because being ""significant majorities"" in ""certain workplaces"" is happening at the same time as ""certain deficiencies""?

To begin with, promoting people on the basis of their sex is illiberal and unfair, and stigmatises its beneficiaries.""</i><p>I have news for the Economist:  in the US, the ""win"" came from doing exactly what they think is illiberal and unfair.  Nearly every major US company makes an explicit, systematic effort to increase female representation in the workplace.<p>Is that ""illiberal"" and wrong?  I don't know.  I like having a balanced workplace, and I think that certain fields (hello, CS!) need more women.  But when I look around and see men doing the vast majority of the blue-collar work (which is <i>why</i> they're being laid off in the ""mancession""), while women make up an ever-increasing proportion of college graduates and the white-collar labor force, I have to wonder when we'll have to start giving <i>men</i> the affirmative action.",1262323921

Pretty much the opposite of my experience, and I seem to not be alone.  Anecdotally, it's interesting to look at the cat fighting between Dave Winer and the Pubsubhub folks about RSS v. Atom and the constant calls for Winer to sort out his namespace issues.   A lot of people seem to find them quite useful and not confusing but, yes, there are people like Winer who (in his case) don't seem to care or (in general) Just Don't Get It.

Binary XML formats, however, can answer your objection - the main problem being that no good binary XML format is yet widely adopted.<p>You say ""`Some day' doesn't do us any good today.""  I half agree.   It is true that, today, if you want to use XML for large binary data you have to place your bet on a suitable binary format and you face a rocky road.  XML ""sucks"" in that sense.   On the other hand, if you can possibly - for the problem you are trying to solve - make a good bet on a binary format for XML, then it is a fine choice because the data model for XML as interchange format is excellent.   So using it for binary today is not an option in many cases and has an element of risk on other cases - but longer term is a winning bet.  Your benefit for considering it today is that longer term pay-off.   ""Go long"" on XML.",1262322126

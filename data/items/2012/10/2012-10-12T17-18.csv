4646140,comment,4645844,4646041,6,0,Dove,,,"Yes, the emptying of the mind is the style of oriental meditation.  In contrast, there is an old tradition of Christian meditation which attempts to fill the mind completely with one concept.<p>For example, in the medieval Lectio Divina (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lectio_Divina"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lectio_Divina</a>), one takes a few words of scripture and repeats them and considers them and ponders them for many minutes.  <i>The Cloud of Unknowing</i> recommends doing something similar with the concept of God, or with a simple word such as ""love"".<p>This is actually a pretty tough mental exercise to do for even just 20 minutes.",1350064778

But it all bleeds together - contemplative practices require a certain level of concentration in order to be able to practice them.<p>Contemplative practices can range from meditation on a specific subject to general observation of your mind, thoughs, body, environment - this latter form is exemplified very well by mindfulness meditation (vipassana, from Theravada Buddhism, though when  mindfulness meditation is taught in the West it is often pretty much cleansed of Buddhist material).<p>What the article describes sounds close to mindfulness meditation. In this case the goal is to quiet the mind, but not silence it or shut out external impression. The breath is used as an ""anchor"" that you return to in order to not let thoughts or feelings or observations drag you along, so that you can observe your thoughts in a detached manner, notice them, and move back to the breath.<p>Compare with some of the concentration practices which include focus on completely emptying your mind for extended periods of time.",1350064489

4646109,comment,4645457,4645966,6,0,VMG,,,"I've seen a detailed explanation of a very sophisticated implementation of GOL in java (using caching, cycle detection and similar things), but I can't find it right now. Damn.<p>Edit: found it <a href=""http://www.ibiblio.org/lifepatterns/lifeapplet.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibiblio.org/lifepatterns/lifeapplet.html</a><p><i>I tend to think of cellular automata optimization as being related to data compression. This is also a simple concept with no simple solution, and what solutions are best depends on the type of data being processed. In Conway's Life, patterns tend to be blobby.<p>For blobby universes, one should probably consider dividing the universe up into blocks approximately the size of the blobs. For Life, 4x4 to 8x8 seem reasonable. I chose the upper bound, 8x8, for reasons of convenience: There happen to be 8 bits in a byte. I strongly considered 4x4, but it didn't work out as nice....<p>You should put the blocks in some kind of list, so that you waste zero time in the empty parts of the universe.<p>Already, note a complication: New elements in the list must be introduced if the pattern grows over a block's boundaries, but we have to know if the block's neighbor already exists. You can either do a simple linear search of the list, or binary search, or keep some kind of map. I chose to make a hash table. This is solely used for finding the neighbors of a new block; each existing block already keeps a pointer to its neighbors, as they will be referenced often.<p>There must also be an efficient algorithm within the blocks. I chose to primarily blaze straight thru each block. There are no inner loops until all cells in a block are processed. Also, fast-lookup tables are employed. I look up 4x4 blocks to determine the inner 2x2.<p>Note: CA programs typically consist of 2 main loops (plus a display loop), because CA rules operate on the cells in parallel, while the microprocessor is conceptually serial. This means that there must be two copies of the universe, effectively, so that no important info is destroyed in the process of creating the next generation. Often these 2 copies are not symmetrical. It was a great struggle for me, since almost every time I took something out of one loop to make it faster, I had to add something else to the other loop! Almost every time, that is; the exceptions to that rule lead to the best optimizations. In particular, there are good tradeoffs to be considered in bit-manipulations: shifting, masking, recombining to form an address in the lookup table....<p>It can also be considered that sometimes the contents of a block may stabilize, requiring no further processing. You could take the block out of the list, putting it in a ""hibernation"" state, only to be re-activated if a neighboring block has some activity spilling into it. These blocks would take zero processing time, just like a blank region of the universe.<p>Period-2 oscillators might also not be very difficult to detect, and remove from the processing time. This might be worthwhile in Life, because the blinker is the most common kind of random debris. Higher period oscillators are much more rare. It is also possible that gliders could be detected and simulated. You will get diminishing returns from this kind of optimization, unless you take it to an extreme (cf. HashLife).<p>Also, a block of cells that's completely empty might not be worth deallocating and removing from the hash table for a while. That takes some processing time, which could be significant in the case of an oscillator moving in and out of its space repeatedly. Only when memory gets low should the oldest blocks from the ""morgue"" be recycled.<p>When the program is fast enough, it should be considered that it isn't worth displaying generations any faster than the eye can see, or at least not much faster than the refresh rate of the monitor. Especially in windowed environments, display time can be a real bottleneck.</i>",1350064377

4646106,comment,4645844,4646069,6,0,webwanderings,,,"> What gains could one expect from focusing<p>I don't want you to think that I am suggesting that you shift your ""focus"" from one activity to another, because that is ultimately is as same as a typical meditation routine. You are  shifting your focus from whatever you were doing, to your focus on sitting idle and doing typical meditation.<p>That's not what I am suggesting with the dishwashing example. The meditation I am describing does not ask for you to focus .... instead, it asks for you to be ""aware"" and ""be in present"".<p>Here's the difference and here's what you can potentially gain:<p>When you are in the present washing dishes, you are training your mind to not be in the past and/or future.  So now, if your mind is in present, than it does not matter if you are washing dishes or singing or dancing. The point is, that in present, you are closer to your true self and in present, you are more alert to the reality.<p>The mind constantly makes you wander either in the past or in the future and we generally don't and cannot stay in the present.<p>The example of doing your favorite activity (like running, exercising, singing, dancing etc) is important here because it is in these activities where you derive a whole lot of satisfaction and contentment for yourself.  It has also been established that athletes usually find loosing themselves in their games at the moment of transcendence and we (the audience) have seen above-human or super natural acts come out of those moments (there is another subject of what audience derives out of watching such events, be that sports games, a movie, a concert etc, etc).<p>Hope you're following.",1350064328

4646092,comment,4644475,4645752,7,0,Cushman,,,"> But her argument was also that according to the original .net magazine article; every woman fears being raped all day every day.<p>I contend that <i>this</i> is a sensationalist statement. The source for this claim, if I understand it, is this:<p><pre><code>  ...our world has a history, spanning thousands of years, of 
  violence as a means to silence and control women. This is
  simply not the case for men, and never has been. Every 
  woman carries that historical weight with her wherever she
  goes, whereas very few men even have an understanding of
  how heavy that weight is.
</code></pre>
That is simply true, as every African American carries the legacy of chattel slavery anywhere they go. Does this mean every black man is constantly afraid he'll be beaten up and arrested? Of course not. But ignoring that legacy will leave you profoundly confused on the subject of race relations.<p>Because women <i>do</i> fear rape. No, not the way a hyperbolic strawman fears being knocked down, but day by day in little ways the fear of violence becomes another part of your life.<p>That creepy guy on the bus who said you looked pretty? He's probably just a harmless old dude. But then he moved to sit next to you and didn't say anything and you were worried he was going to touch you. So you get off at the next stop even though you aren't home yet, because the last time something like this happened that guy found out where you worked and took the same bus as you for a week... And you <i>know</i> he's probably harmless and you feel like an idiot waiting for the next bus except your best friend was raped at a party and had to get an abortion and never told anyone but you and God, why are you even thinking about that? Why is it so hard for men to just <i>leave you alone</i>?<p>Since we're avoiding generalizations, I will be specific: <i>Every single woman</i> that I have known intimately enough to know such things has such stories. Those who had not been victims of rape themselves, that is. Of course, they don't complain about it, because complaining about it has never, ever helped.<p>Does that mean ""every woman fears being raped all day every day""? Stop talking like that. You know what it means.<p>> She generally doesn't concern herself with posts like these but she felt the need to considering a man (I know you don't care about gender but it's important factor that a man is telling her how she feels) is saying what sexism is to EVERYONE.<p>I will charitably grant she mistook his speaking in generalities to be making pronouncements. For example, he says ""A group of all men just doesn't seem as welcoming to women,"" to which she retorts ""in general I find that men are in fact, more welcoming"". They're plainly speaking past each other; he spoke of a statistical fact, such as ""Black men are more likely to be arrested"", and she responded with a personal fact, such as ""I'm not a criminal.""<p>It's obvious why these sorts of general statements are so dangerous, since they're so easy to misinterpret or use for evil (and tacking on some kind of IMHO doesn't help at all). In general, I'd avoid making them in the first place, except there are questions we need them to answer: ""Why are so many black men being arrested?"" or ""Why are so few women entering tech?""<p>So I think I'd be a lot more charitable toward her position if I saw some indication that she got what the original article was actually <i>about</i>: ""I'm concerned about the gender gap in tech. I think it's an important thing for us to be talking about.""<p>Then we can all work to figure out a way to talk about it that doesn't leave some people feeling unrepresented.",1350064150

A scientific study differs from an unscientific one in a number of ways, one of which is the presence of a control group.<p>2. To create a control for this hypothesis, create one MLS listing with photos, and another MLS listing without (if that's possible). See which one produces the desired result.<p>3. In lieu of (2) above, if that's not practical, do a classic Web A/B test -- create two versions of a web-based advertisement for a property, one with photos, one without (or one with more and one with fewer photos), each with a click-through. Then simply count clicks. This way, you don't have to track the outcomes, only logged clicks, which means you get results faster.<p>Item (3) above can also test varying advertising content, not just the photo issue. It's quite common to use A/B testing in Web design, so some of the infrastructure may already be present in the server. The key to the method is to randomly choose between two or three page designs when an URL request arrives at the server, and track the outcomes keyed to the designs.<p>This approach would give you a more scientific result, because it's based on a comparison in which <i>the only thing changed is the thing being measured</i> -- same property, different number of photos. Same property, different description.<p>Before closing, I have to tell my favorite real estate joke (which I invented). An agent visits a ""distressed"" property and is almost overwhelmed by the smell of the interior -- it literally smells as though there are mushrooms growing in the walls.<p>But our hero always thinks positively. He returns to the office and begins writing the listing. A long pause as he tries to think of a way to put a positive spin on the property. Finally a light bulb appears over his head, and he begins typing. The first word: ""Breathtaking!""",1350063844

Urges almost always present themselves as urgent tasks, but they aren't always important.<p>I'm not sure I agree with the conclusion that meditation will make you more productive. The evidence presented reminds me of a scenario from The Office, where Michael defends Monday morning movies by claiming they are more productive the rest of the day. Of course the reason they are more productive is because they have to be in order to recover the time spent watching a movie!<p>Rather, I think people don't realize how much spare time there is that gets wasted.

There are pros and cons to each, of course, but I think there are a lot of situations where the latter is going to be better.<p>One example being: if I was building a new product and wanted to add some reporting/exporting features, I would <i>much</i> rather use a service like this.

Part of the spat between Boeing and Airbus over their next gen ~150 seat passenger planes (737max & A320neo)[1] is over how many passengers are used in the calculations (maximize for your own plane, minimize for the other guy).  To get an idea of how the argument goes see this article starting in the ""war of words"" section which gives a good idea of all the factors making up the cost of flying:  <a href=""http://www.aspireaviation.com/2012/07/20/boeing-737-max-ups-the-ante-in-dogfight-with-a320neo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aspireaviation.com/2012/07/20/boeing-737-max-ups-...</a><p>The efficiency improvements come from all over the place including dealing with wing tips (fences, winglets, ""sharklets""), weight reductions (lighter materials, redesigned components) and engines (weight, gearboxes, compression ratios).<p>The plane manufacturers and engine manufacturers are constantly doing tweaks to give improvements, usually managing around 1% per year.  Search for ""performance improvement package"" to see numerous press releases and articles.<p>In the future there are blended wing bodies and open rotor engines that have another leap in efficiency.<p>[1] The tradeoffs are very similar to what we see in the IT industry.  For example the 737 is lighter and sits lower to the ground.  That means it can't use larger diameter more efficient engines.  And makes it more efficient for shorter routes due to less weight, but the heavier higher A320 can then be more efficient over longer routes.  Every change made involves retooling and recertification so it isn't a simple decision to just do everything possible.  And newer better planes effect the residual values of older planes which makes lessors potentially less likely to buy your newer planes due to economic uncertainty.  There was a lot of debate and speculation about re-engining the existing models, re-winging too, fuselage material changes etc.",1350062523

We implemented the plan as it now exists. The outcome has been a disaster. Please take 5 to 10 minutes to write a brief history of that disaster.</i>
<i>As a team converges on a decision, public doubts about the wisdom of the planned move are gradually suppressed and eventually come to be treated as evidence of flawed loyalty. The suppression of doubt contributes to overconfidence in a group where only supporters of the decision have a voice. The main virtue of the premortem is that it legitimizes doubts.</i>
<i>Furthermore, it encourages even supporters of the decision to search for possible threats not considered earlier. The premortem isnt a panacea and doesnt provide complete protection against nasty surprises, but it goes some way toward reducing the damage of plans that are subject to the biases of uncritical optimism.</i>",1350062216

One of the biggest problems with EBM, though, is that what often is advertised EBM, actually isn't.<p>My ex was a medical doctor, and for fun I used to read NEMJ and BMJ articles through her subscription. If you trace through references, you often find a (reasonably rigorous) study with reasonable effect observed on a group 40 norwegian women aged 40-50; which in a later article referencing it is assumed to apply to all women in that age group; and through the years is assumed to apply to all women in all age groups. And that's the part that is ""easy"" to trace (except no one ever does, and it's not really easy)<p>Additionally, the statistical evidence is inherently weaker than is presented (in a way which no one can actually evaluate) due to the lack of accounting for negative results and unreported trials.<p>Also, accepted login in EBM is not acceptable from a math perspective.

Some hard things are hard because they require social or economic activity at absolutely massive scales.<p>EDIT: Followup.<p><i>Since its creation in 2002, the International Criminal Court has only convicted one person...The lack of reliable evidence is a primary limiting factor in the ability to successfully bring cases to both national and international courts.</i><p>That's is such a bald-faced misrepresentation that it is close to being an outright lie.  The ICC is the outgrowth of the Interntional Criminal Tribunals which prosecuted warcrimes in Rwanda, Somalia, Bosnia, etc.  Prior to the formation of the ICC, each atrocity (or set of atrocities) required the formation of a special-purpose tribunal created to prosecute those war crimes.<p>_The ICC does not have jurisdiction over warcrimes or other atrocities committed prior to July 1, 2002_.  Moreover, due to the interference of Russia, China and the U.S., it does not have jurisdiction over crimes committed by citizens of non-signatory states (such as Russia, China, the U.S., or India) unless case is referred to it by the U.N.<p>The ICC currently in the process of investigating atrocities in 7 nations in Africa (including Congo and Sudan), none of which are signatories to the ICC Treaty.  The cases had to be referred to the ICC by the UN, overcomming resistance by Russia and China.<p>Like most felony cases in Western nations, ICC cases take time.  It's not a matter of inefficiency, it's a matter of collecting the overwhelming amounts of evidence that go hand in hand with the callous murders of hundreds and thousands of people.<p><i>1) The financing, arming, and coordination of atrocity perpetrators are too-often enabled through the activities of third parties such as multinational companies or financial institutions.</i><p>We already know who they are.  We didn't need technology to discover this.  Decades-old securities regulations pre-dating WWII sufficed.<p><i>2. In the aftermath of an atrocity, one common deficit is the availability of authentic and relevant evidence against the perpetrators. This documentation  including establishing a clear chain of custody  is essential to make the case for apprehension, to allow effective judicial proceedings, and often lays the groundwork for robust truth and reconciliation processes.</i><p>The problem has never been the lack of documentary evidence, or proof of authenticity.  There has been <i>plenty</i> of evidence, since people who brazenly and openly kill hundreds and thousands of their fellows don't bother to destroy evidence.  The problem is frequently that there is so much evidence that it takes time to go through it all. It's an issue of manpower, not lack of technology.<p><i>3.  During acute crises, vulnerable populations are often cut off from critical information and have limited, if any, ability to communicate inside or outside of their communities. While there are a number of existing efforts aimed at improving information flow in these contexts, many focus on the outflow of information from communities or rely too heavily on existing communications infrastructure or basic literacy.</i><p>Cell phones are cheap, easy, and do not require the development of untested new technologies.  They also have the benefit of accomplishing all of these goals without much training.<p><i>4. There is often a lack of credible data and relevant information from large parts of the globe, thereby making it more difficult for the international community to identify, acknowledge and act to prevent or stop potential or ongoing atrocities.</i><p>This is not a problem technology can solve.  The lack of ""credible data"" and ""reliable information"" is a problem in Western nations, despite our massive technological and educational bases.

Therefore, there was little to be gained by reading it.<p>The rebuttal may not have been of great importance, but we couldn't have written it.  It's one person's experience (though there are probably a significant number like her) and it adds to our model of the situation.  Also, it makes a significant meta-point: stereotyping is bad even when done by the self-proclaimed champions of the stereotyped group.",1350061436

The modding community just made much better and easier to use tools.  .wad files were also created specifically to encourage modding and make it non-destructive.<p>Excerpt from Masters of Doom:<p>> Though Carmack and Romero were intrigued and inspired by these actions, they were concerned over the destructive quality of the mods. Players had to erase the original Wolfenstein code and replace it with their own images; once a Nazi was changed into Barney, there was no way to bring the Nazi back quickly. For Doom, Carmack organized the data so players could replace sound and graphics in a nondestructive manner. He created a subsystem that separated the media data, called WADs (an acronym suggested by Tom Hall, it stood for Wheres All the Data?), from the main program. Every time someone booted up the game, the program would look for the WAD file of sounds and images to load in. This way, someone could simply point the main program to a different WAD without damaging the original contents. Carmack would also upload the source code for the Doom level-editing and utilities program so that the hackers could have the proper tools with which to create new stuff for the game.",1350061364

Accordingly, the fill commands will not break a line after a period followed by just one space. If you set the variable sentence-end-double-space to nil, the fill commands will break a line after a period followed by one space, and put just one space after each period. See Sentences, for other effects and possible drawbacks of this.",1350061356

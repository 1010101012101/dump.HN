573782,comment,572730,573453,0,0,Silhouette,,,"There are musical works that have been under copyright for longer than the average human lifetime. In most places, singing ""Happy Birthday"" to a child in the street is an infringement of copyright. Amazon successfully patented ""one click"". Other people have patented inventions that contradict the laws of physics as we know them. Mike Rowe got harassed by one of the largest and most recognisable brands in the world for making a joke out of the similarity between his name and theirs.<p>If you're so deluded as to think that common sense always works in the area of intellectual property law, I think it's pointless to argue with you.",1240401218

My ex-wife too!<p>If you ask me, when it comes to most of those types of people, the whole ""positive"" thing is just mental and emotional masturbation plus crack.<p>I can only be real in life. ""Positive"" or ""negative"" are just illusions that cloud the FACTS.",1240400840

I learned from Linus that git is a decentralized ""content"" database that gives identity to different versions of the same content and allows them to be compared and merged.

I learned from Damien that CouchDB is a decentralized ""document"" database that gives identity to different versions of the same document and allows them to be compared and merged.<p>I've been wondering just what the difference really is.",1240399872

At the same time you could be charging as well, and even though this adds complexity, it also adds a business. Charging does reduce popularity in the short term and chances of going viral.<p>I suppose it's generally the most altruistic that give a to a website.

573767,comment,573763,573763,0,0,raganwald,,,"Okay, okay, this may ""amuse"" hackers but is it <i>interesting?</i> The reason I found it provocative is that it reminds me of a huge challenge we face when introducing new ideas outside of the startup echo chamber.<p>Even something that seems obvious like email at one time seemed mysterious. Why would anyone besides a nerd have wanted it in 1985? It was feature-poor compared to paper and most people had never heard of it. If few of your friends and business contacts had email, why would you want it?<p>What are we inventing today? And how will we explain it to the rest of the world?",1240399657

573760,comment,573699,573755,0,0,ivanstojic,,,"There are some things that I find extremely enticing about Git. First of, there's the speed which I already mentioned. The second is how it's designed to be decentralized - and my amazement at this probably stems from the fact that this is the first decentralized VCS that I've ever worked with.<p>I've been using rsync to keep certain directories of my various computers synchronized, but I think I'll go one step further soon enough: for my Linux computers, I'll keep some parts of my home directory in Git in order to maintain an identical user interface / configuration on those machines.",1240399124

He has some interesting blog articles about the subject which Google will bring up.<p><a href=""http://blog.getpaint.net/2007/07/13/making-money-with-freeware-tip-1-have-a-donate-button/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.getpaint.net/2007/07/13/making-money-with-freewa...</a><p>More typical is SyntaxHighlighter, which is the JS syntax highlighting thing that everyone and their dog uses on their blog.  The author has raised about $100 in donations so far (number pulled off site).  I'm one quarter of that, because his software saved me so much work I donated the USD equivalent of one sale of my software to him.  Since he started accepting donations his software has been, conservatively, downloaded several hundred thousand times by people who use it to increase their commercial and professional opportunities.<p>Compare that to commercial software for a moment: I sell about a hundred dollars worth of licenses to my bingo thingee a day, on rather substantially less than several hundred thousand installs.<p>Which is a long way to say ""Charge money for value"".<p>(Relatedly, I am reminded of a good line I heard from a developmental economist once: Only one country ever got rich from foreign aid, and the Vatican is not a great model for Africa.)",1240399053

Either you allow arguments by others (you are no biochemist either I guess?), or you stick to it, and leave it where it is - there is no scientific consensus about what ""is the problem in our society"". We can only argue about that, without facts.<p>I can't find the paper, but I read that high insulin levels are the new devil. If that's true, then bread (remember, mass production started only during the industrial revolution), corn, and especially sugar, are to be restricted as much as possible. Alas, you in the US have a massive corn lobby (real sugar became scarce during the Cuba crisis), so it would be difficult to do away only with corn.<p>IMHO the root of the problem is not that there's too much food, but the industrialization of the food processing industry. Everything has both advantages and disadvantages - we can choose from 1000 bread sorts, but many of them are heavily processed and freed from all micronutrients. And like every system, the food industry can go haywire, and I think it already has. E.g., look at what kind of chickens KFC breeds for use in their products. Food has therefore become a comodity, and people treat it like that. We are just not used to paying large parts of our income for food anymore, but we really should be - it's an essential part of life, just like housing. They key is quality, and being nice to both animals and environment is important.",1342687982

There are subtle anti-woman biases in medicine which are <i>far</i> more pervasive than anything I have seen in the software industry.<p>For example, if you look at gender in diagrams in medical textbooks, male figures are more likely to represent healthy, normal body functioning while female figures are more likely to be used where the figure represents disease.[1]  Self-degrading Real Men(tm) jokes[2] aside I don't see anything similar to that in the software industry.<p>The big difference is that medicine is a relatively <i>stable</i> industry and you don't have the huge pushes to release a product that you do in the tech industry.  Physicians often are better able to set their own hours and decide how much to work than can software engineers working for Marissa Mayer.  So for a woman wanting to have a stable, secure career which is friendly towards starting a family will find medicine very appealing and high tech startups rather threatening.  On the other hand if Google was having trouble recruiting women now, I would suggest they have a problem.<p>[1]  See ""Birth as an American Rite of Passage"" by Robbie Davis-Floyd.  This is also a wonderful critique of systemic sexism in modern obstetrics of a sort that does <i>not</i> go away with more women entering the field.<p>[2]  such as Linus Torvald's ""Real men don't use backups.

I'm a citizen of the internet with AdBlockPlus, but I remind myself that a huge number of people still watch television and read magazines and newspapers. Greenpeace had about $22m in total expenses in 2009 and 2010 each, Shell made $31bn in 2011 profits alone. Is there anything stopping Shell from dropping a few billion on advertising if they wanted to (and convinced the share holders it was a good idea)? They have the money to flood the most popular media outlets, but a top google result highlighting an ""aggressive ad campaign"" (<a href=""http://adage.com/article/news/shell-oil-breaks-industry-silence-aggressive-ad-push/144641/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adage.com/article/news/shell-oil-breaks-industry-sile...</a>) suggests they only spend about $15m per year in advertising. When it comes down to it, they probably don't even need to bother. Consumers will get their gas from the lowest-priced gas station they know of. I actually think this action by Greenpeace works in Shell's favor purely due to association when people see the Shell logo as they're driving down a street for gas. I imagine for the common folk Greenpeace hopes to manipulate it produces more of an ""oh you"" reaction than ""I hate you and will never buy from a Shell station!"" one, if the image macros are even believed to be official. ""Everyone knows"" the oil companies are evil (or at least corrupted and in bed with the government).<p>For the record, this was also a top google result about a 2011 advertised claim being thrown out as misleading. <a href=""http://royaldutchshellplc.com/2011/10/19/shell-ads-banned-over-fuel-claims/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://royaldutchshellplc.com/2011/10/19/shell-ads-banned-ov...</a> Not that it says much, I'm sure I can find instances of every multibillion dollar company lying (as well as Greenpeace and PETA).",1342686048

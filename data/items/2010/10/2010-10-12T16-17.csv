1784037,comment,1782875,1782875,0,0,Silhouette,,,"Just to add a few extra data points, for those in the UK but outside London...<p>I've set up more than one small company, with various accountants. The typical fee for a bespoke deal (customising things like share classes if you want) always seems to work out around £300, one way or another. You could get a limited company much cheaper, probably under £50, if you don't need anything special and you're happy to buy one off the shelf and sort out all the paperwork yourself.<p>(Pro tip: If occasionally dropping a few hundred pounds on good professional services makes you wince, this is not the lifestyle for you. You need to understand the value of your time, how much time it really takes to deal with overheads, the real cost of getting official paperwork like contracts and financial statements wrong, and the benefits of different kinds of professional insurance and organisation memberships. Contractors charge much more then employees per hour for good reasons, and one of those reasons is that they have to deal with these overheads.)<p>IMHO, the tax and legal regulation isn't so bad, as long as you have a reasonable accountant. Producing annual financial statements for a personal contracting company shouldn't cost more than £1,000 unless you're exceptionally busy, and even good accountants might charge closer to half of that if you're only raising an invoice every few weeks and paying out occasional dividends so there isn't much work for them to do. Filing the other statutory paperwork and keeping track of the various deadlines is irritating and does waste a few hours each year, but it doesn't require specialist knowledge or skills you can't learn in an hour-long meeting with your accountant.<p>(Pro tip: If you're worrying about whether you can keep business records effectively and remember to file stuff, this is not the lifestyle for you. As a freelancer, whether you are self-employed or a company director, you will be legally responsible for getting this stuff right, and while most honest mistakes can be fixed without incurring major penalties, you certainly do hear about people who got it wrong and wound up paying tens of thousands in back taxes.)<p>Contract rates outside London are significantly lower, but still far higher on an hourly basis than working as an employee.<p>Some other general comments...<p>I second the recommendation in the article for PCG membership. To me, just having access to templates for standard contracting documents and to the tax and legal helplines was very useful when I first started out. There are also some benefits in terms of insurance, either directly in some cases or where membership gets you a discount with a third party on other professional insurance policies you might want/need. And there is a lot of other generally useful contracting advice to be had, forums that might help some people, etc.<p>The same does <i>not</i> apply to many other professional bodies. As a general rule, if membership costs a lot and lets you put letters after your name, but it's not a genuine university awarding a recognised qualification, there is about a 98% chance that it is a waste of money IME.<p>For finding work, recommendations/networking >> agencies. You probably know some friends or former colleagues who do contract work if you've been in the industry for a while, and they might well share potential opportunities if you just tell them you're going freelance and ask.<p>Being able to choose your own hours (including how many of them you work in a week) is a huge advantage to completely freelance work. There is no more putting in silly hours without overtime pay because your megalomaniac boss screwed up the project timescales and the deadline is coming up.<p>Working from home is both a blessing and a curse. It can be wonderful, but you do need to consider basic things like setting up a proper office in a dedicated room (particularly if you've got a partner/family) and how you're going to interact with other real people if you're not getting out of the house every day. Do check the implications for things like capital gains tax and planning consents with someone who knows what they're talking about as well.<p>Finally, as far as job security goes, I'm not convinced employment isn't a bit of a con here. Sure, firing someone is relatively difficult in the UK, but not if your company is going bust anyway, and with employment you're effectively locked into working with a single serious employer, often on quite nasty terms that interfere with or outright prohibit other commercial activities while not guaranteeing you any career progression. Who really has more financial security, the employee working for Big Employer (who lays off people 5,000 at a time when the axe falls) or the freelance contractor who can take on two contracts simultaneous, each using about half their time but with a different client, and who has developed relationships with half a dozen clients who come back with repeat business?<p>In a nutshell, if you're technically competent <i>and</i> you are organised and professional enough to deal with some basic business management, freelancing can be an excellent career choice. I think far more people in many technical/creative industries would choose to do it if they knew what it was really like, and you find far more people who say they wish they'd made the jump sooner than who give it up and went back to working for The Man. It isn't for everyone, but I'd certainly encourage anyone who has wondered if it might be for them to at least look into it properly.",1286902706

A) -1 to 1 is a normalized range that you can scale to anything easily<p>B) A non-vote counts as a middle-of the range vote. That's really cool.<p>So that means people who don't vote are the same as people who vote right in the middle, and so you only have to store a total participant count rather than an additional voter_count. This system seems to make for fair ratings that can be compared between items. What do you think?<p>PS: How about storing DECIMAL(10, 10) so no one has a perfect -1 or perfect 1 rating ever?

Unless you have some inside information, it's hard to say if they were undercharging for their service. Without knowing what their overhead was like I don't think it's fair to say that the service was underpriced. Just because they can charge a lot for something doesn't mean they should.<p>One would hope they would have been able to sustain the free tier based on the revenue from the paying tiers so that they could sustain the free tier in the hopes that many of them would become paying customers.<p>On twitter, however, they claimed this change was a move to get rid of accounts where users had paying customers but weren't actually paying chargify yet. This would have been fine, but they also doubled prices for anyone who had between 50 and 500 customers and raised the prices for the other tiers as well. Their explanation doesn't match with their actions.<p><pre><code>  Chargify offers great service.</code></pre>
In my experience it was really just mediocre service. While I give them credit for trying, It seemed like Lance was handling a lot of the support himself and to his own admission he's not a technical support person. There were a couple of times he just sent my partner links to the documentation without actually answering a question. No offense to Lance or anything, but it was clearly a good idea to hire a technical support person. The only problem is, now that I'm fully integrated, I don't really need help / support unless their service goes down or something breaks.<p><pre><code>  Chargify has been very transparent.</code></pre>
Only after the fact. Sure, they get a couple of points for that but I still wouldn't consider this a good thing.<p><pre><code>  You must do your own due diligence</code></pre>
Do you often ask a service if they are going to raise their prices any time soon before you sign up? Do you think they would have said yes if I had asked them 6 months ago? Honestly, I thought $49/month was a pretty fair price and didn't really expect it to change any time soon. I looked at all of the options out there and felt like chargify offered the best service at the best price.

Apache isn't the end-all be-all of Java projects, however.<p>Several of the larger newer projects were under SpringSource's wing, and there continue to be new projects there. And there's Codehaus. And some Java projects under GitHub, Java.net, SourceForge, etc. Then there's Groovy, Grails, and related projects. JRuby (formerly at Sun, now at EngineYard) is Ruby, but it allows some reuse of other Java projects. Android (like the author states) is a subset of Java, so all of those Android app projects. Kindle's KDK is Java. Your cable box may even run on Java.<p>If you've been only looking at Apache for Java growth, you've been looking in the wrong place.<p>""Or how many existing projects will have any significant effort put behind them?""<p>The Java projects at Apache have had continued effort put behind them, but some of the people that would have put effort towards Apache projects have spread out into some of the places I mentioned.<p>""If Java at Apache flounders, the platform as a whole will also diminish.""<p>That's BS. If Apache fell on its ass, Java would still survive. See all of the other projects I mentioned, plus all of the current Java jobs I mentioned.<p>Where ""Java"" itself isn't the new hot thing, Java is dominant, and things using/requiring Java are hot, for example- look at this Google trends of Java vs. Android to see what I mean:<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/trends?q=java%2C+android"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/trends?q=java%2C+android</a>",1286899908

But what's the reason for that? It's quite cumbersome to notify the site owner: first you need to search for a contact or feedback link, and then you also need to describe what feature you're actually talking about.<p>So with reportaproblem you as a site owner receive a simple HTML snippet containing a ""Report a problem"" link that you attach next to all your important features on your web page.<p>When a user clicks such a link, inside the page a popover appears and you can quickly enter what's wrong without leaving the page.<p>I haven't (yet) put all that much effort into it, for example it probably needs a more decent navigation. I see it more like a proof of concept for now, also because I don't know whether or not it's a small and viable business idea at all.<p>In general, such links from reportaproblem.at are free, but I consider asking for a one-time fee to customize it (right now it's also free), and I also plan to provide additional features if it catches on.<p>I'm curious for your opinions.

In 1953 (the year before his death) he even convinced Robert Millikan, 1923 recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physics and director of physics at the California Insitute of Technology, that it was probably wrong to interpret red-shift as an expanison of the universe.<p>Hubble ended his book _Observational Approach to Cosmology_ with the statement: ""... if the recession factor is dropped, if red-shifts are not primarily velocity-shifts, the picture is simple and plausible. There is no evidence of expansion and no restriction of time-scale, no trace of spatial curvature, and no limitation of spatial dimensions. Moreover, there is no problem of inter-nebular material. The observable region is thoroughly homogeneous; it is too small a sample to indicate the nature of the universe at large. The univers might even be an expanding model, provided the rate of expansion, which pure theory does not specify, is inappreciable. For that matter, the universe might even be contracting.""",1286899442

When he's writing something I don't think he just creates a ""story"" in his head, I think he crafts a whole society as a canvas. He has the ability, like many artists, to craft an extremely vivid picture in his mind and then translate that vision and eventually the story to his writing.   So when he's telling the ""Zuckerburg"" story he creates an alternate reality but with some small basis in truth.  A world where women are treated in a misogynistic manner, in a world inhabited by socially inept genius and an out of touch upper crust.<p>In this case he bases a lot of what he's built on the books and stories written, quite frankly, by the losers of the Facebook battles.  These inform and lead the story but by the time its complete the villains, attitudes, and societies have been morphed into something quite more archetypical then their corresponding reality.  Small quirks he finds interesting get expanded into large issues. Molehills are turned into mountains.<p>And really he's done a great job.

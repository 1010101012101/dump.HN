Mark's argument is that point to multi-point streaming of live video events isn't feasible technologically because of bandwidth limitations.  His argument is a straw man.<p>There are problems with point to multipoint video streaming.  That doesn't kill internet video.  Fewer and fewer people are watching live events as they happen.  Many people want the content, but they want to watch it asynchronously, not live.  People are increasingly recording the shows that they want to watch on DVR and then watching them whenever they want.  Internet video is all about watching content whenever you want to, not about watching the content live. That's where Mark is wrong.<p>Who here watched the inauguration live?  I watched it on Hulu 1 hour after it happened.  Much more convenient than trying to remember to hit the DVR record button.<p>The boon that YouTube and internet video has been for content creators is that they can get any distribution at all.  Before YouTube and video streaming, if you had video content and you wanted to distribute it, you could either try to get a TV station to pick it up, sell it to a movie studio, or market it directly yourself via direct sales.<p>It's actually _possible_ now for a content creator to distribute their video on YouTube and get it seen by one million people.  That's the promise of internet video, not that one million people are going to watch your content all at once.<p>And, it's that sort of distribution is making a lot more cottage video industries possible like Peepcode:  <a href=""http://peepcode.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://peepcode.com/</a>  Where a couple of guys can make a living selling educational video streamcasts.

Some, hard core Libertarians seem to want the government to have a military. Everything after that point is debatable.  Some think public roads are a bad idea, others are fine with public police forces etc.<p>As a movement it has some good ideas, but there is also a huge collection of irrational people that are pro Libertarian and have little understanding of human behavior.  For example we removed most monopolies because they where a bad idea keeping a few that are more effective than breaking them up so many people seem to ignore the idea that monopolies are bad.  In theory there might be little problem with monopolies until you start to consider how people behave.<p>PS: <i>The articles of faith that underlie the standard Libertarian predictions of how the world will work under their system are largely derived from the capitalist myth, and share all its imbalances in how it understands and defines human nature.  It is my belief that as long as Libertarian philosophy ties itself so closely to idealizing capitalism, or makes itself too absolutist in any other way, an attempt to get people to live by purely Libertarian principles will find itself fighting against aspects of human nature that it doesn't want to acknowledge, and if it doesn't compromise it will fail because it tries to make people only half human. </i>",1233163694

Is there any alternative?",,"Sorry if this is not hacker news, but my wife just went to the dentist, and the estimate for fixing her teeth came out to $12k after insurance. About 8 of the teeth need post&core followed by crown/porcelain. I can explain the background of the situation if need be, but in short, she has bad teeth despite your normal prophylactic measures.<p>I would think that there should be research into implanting some kind of stem cell that would grow into a new tooth. Is anyone familiar with anything like this? If not, are there alternatives to this (expensive) procedure?<p>FWIW, we're both Russian; we're looking into the costs/benefits of traveling to Russia to do this. We're currently in US.",1233162693

Remember that every AAPL owner is a part owner of the company. It's not at all untoward for an investor in the company to want to know what health the CEO is in, especially one thought to be as influential as him, and Jobs has been opaque about it since the beginning. A lot of people have, collectively, over $80b tied up in the company, and they have no idea if the guy running it will live another year or two.<p>When your company goes public, a decision Steve himself made long ago, you know that from then on, what you disclose to owners of the company you effectively disclose to everyone. He knew what he was getting.<p>Speculating as to his health doesn't worsen it or harm him in any way.

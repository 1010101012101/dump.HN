It seems fine to think I've three copies of that file but what if machine failure occurs before MogileFS has created the other two?<p>Also, it's intended to operate on whole files at a time, although HTTP GET might be usable to fetch a run of bytes.  If two web servers both try and write the same filename, doesn't the latest one win?<p>I can see it's great for certain things, e.g. storing the user's images, but not for the stuff traditionally in the database.  Or have I missed something?<p>Cheers, Ralph.",1177062466

But not requiring registration seems to translate more easily to some sites than others.<p>Say a registering user has the ability to claim a two-word sub-domain of foo.com, e.g. top.dog.foo.com, and to start setting up their data there, including who can view the data and sending email invites out to others.  What should non-registering users be able to do?<p>The alternatives I can think of are:  Have a set of *.try.foo.com sites that they can play around with and reset them to sane defaults occasionally.  Or, let them nab the site name of their choice but warn them it gets deleted unless they register within 24 hours.  Either way, I'd like to avoid site names getting used up for no good reason.  Any better ideas?<p>Cheers, Ralph.",1177061579

Len Bosack and Sandy Lerner of Cisco talked about this in Nerds 2.0.1 here:\n<a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2534997893350167670&q=nerds+2.0.1#53m17s"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2534997893350167670&q=nerds+2.0.1#53m17s</a><p>They financed the company with credit card debt and were already doing $250,000-$500,000 a month in business when they finally got venture capital (after 70+ unsuccessful tries).  However, they agreed to a forfeiture contract and a 4-year vesting period, and strongly advise everyone else not to do it that way.<p>They were so disgusted with the way they were treated that they sold off all their shares long ago.  If they still held them, they'd each be worth about $24 billion today (they had 30% of the company, like the Google founders).\n",1177061109

15001,comment,14807,14807,0,0,BitGeek,,,"Ah, I see venture hacks isn't really on the side of the entrepreneur after all.<p>Any VC that asks you to vest your shares is a VC who is trying to steal from you.<p>The business pre-money valuation is value you created.  Your ownership of that is property you have EARNED. <p>When you take VC money, they get a percentage of the company, and your ownership is diluted, but at the same time the value of the company goes up, as it now has more cash assets in the bank.  The end result is immediately post money the value of your shares should be about the same as pre-money, only the ownership percentage of the company is less. <p>This is fair, and this is the consideration you  give up in exchange for their investment.<p>However, if they ask you to also re-vest your shares, are asking you to give up you property (and your voting power) in the hope that you will ""Earn them back""... which first assumes you hav eto earn them (eg: it is a losss of property if you don't own it anymore) and secondly assumes that they won't have pushed you out.  While your shares are vesting you can't vote them, which gives the VC even more power.<p>Finally, they are not giving you consideration for these shares you're putting in jeapardy and so they are simply asking you to give them something for nothing.  The investment they are making is already paid for by you in the dilution you are experiencing.<p>There is absolutely no reason for a founders shares to re-vest.  <p>If your ownership in the company is not enough to ensure your interests are aligned with the VCs (Who really can't do much to make the company do well, but you can.) then the VCs wouldn't be investing-- period.  So the alignment of ownership excuse is patently absurd. <p>No reputable VC will ask you to vest your shares.  Only a thief would do that-- you own the shares, and asking you to give them up for nothing is trying to take advantage.<p>If a VC wants to put you on a vesting schedule to keep you incentivized.... let him offer you shares out of his pool to vest into.<p>Anything else is exceedingly greedy on the part of the VC.",1177059665

My guess is, he/she is not the kind of software QA engineer you might be accustomed to depending on the kinds of companies you&#x27;ve worked at. Think of automated custom static and dynamic code analysis, continuous integration, build systems, deployment monitoring, etc. Places like Google and Stripe (and many other technical organizations with good engineering culture) have very skilled people doing these things.<p>I&#x27;m a normal/infrastructure engineer who reluctantly ends up focusing on test systems every once in a while. I get all the tests running, from a single script, with all results collated and machine readable, get CI set up properly, make the system reliable enough to trust, etc. Because someone has to do it! And yes I&#x27;ve done this in organizations where there was a QA engineer or two, who did reasonably cheap semi-automated QA, but couldn&#x27;t put together a whole system and make it reliable enough to run on its own. But there are definitely a few places where QA engineer is not the &quot;lowest rank&quot;.",1440820685

There is a bottom to how low a stock can go, but no theoretical upper limit. Although realistically he&#x27;d likely be forced to buy into stock if it got too high, keep some reserve of money on hand, and be insured against extreme upticks anyway.<p>A short sale is an agreement for a party to buy a stock at a discounted price on the condition that the other party buy it for that person at a later date. That is, I say &quot;That Chinese stock isn&#x27;t any good. In two months the price will go down. So tell you what, you give me the money for that stock and you&#x27;ll get your stock in two months, no matter what the price plus some extra as a discount.

10139000,comment,10138322,10138607,0,0,wpietri,,,"You&#x27;re also neglecting capital costs. I think Uber&#x27;s major business innovation is shifting almost all of the cost and risk onto drivers by selling them &quot;independence&quot; and &quot;great money&quot;. Previously, cab companies had to buy and maintain fleets of expensive cars; the biggest risk a driver took was the cost of one shift&#x27;s rental. Now some are in hock for tens of thousands of dollars. And possibly millions given that they are no longer covered by taxi company insurance.<p>Honestly, I think it&#x27;s more risk than opportunity for them. Once driverless cars are ubiquitous, the barrier to entry will be pretty low. Currently to compete with Uber you need to sign up a bunch of drivers, trick them into paying most of your expenses, and then pay them just barely enough to keep them from quitting. But if all it takes is money for cars and the ability to buy an app, anybody with a strong brand and access to capital can go after them.<p>Imagine, for example, you&#x27;re BMW&#x27;s CEO. You can build custom cars tuned for taxi service. You know the in-car software very, very well. You have a mess of industrial designers and deep research on customer motivations. Whenever normal-market orders dip, you just keep building for your taxi fleet and occasionally declare war on Uber in a new major city when you can flood it with shiny cars. You already have a service network and get parts at cost. You have incredible access to capital, great relationships with millions of existing consumers, and one of the world&#x27;s strongest brands. Wouldn&#x27;t it be tempting to say, &quot;Fuck it, we&#x27;ve been in the transportation business for 100 years! This is just the next step.&quot;",1440820434

Over the years that followed, these controls evolved into the byzantine tiered system by which the government’s oil dollars are sold at three different official prices — while hard-currency dollars fetch a fourth, higher price on the black market.<p>An importer who pledges to purchase basic necessities to bring into the country can buy a dollar for about six bolívars. But walk up to a bank teller and the same dollar costs 178 bolívars: nearly 3,000 percent more. For the 264 bolívars that it cost at the time of this writing to buy one black-market dollar, you could buy 42 dollars at the official rate.<p>The system gives rise to a mind-bending tangle of economic distortions. By one calculation, with a single $100 bill exchanged at the black market rate, you can buy enough subsidized gasoline in Venezuela to drive a Hummer around the world 28 times. A new Toyota Corolla retails for about 1.9 million bolívars — that’s either about $300,000 (at one exchange rate) or around $7,200 (at another), take your pick. As in our fable, the exchange-rate regime creates huge incentives for importers to pocket their cheap dollars rather than bring in goods — and that gives rise to lines. Long lines. For all the basics.<p>Alongside scarcity, a new specter — or rather, an old one — has emerged.

In both systems you communicate with I/O devices as if they were files.  The interface they provide to user processes uses system calls to present a programming interface that is much simpler than that of the underlying machine; those processes can have multiple threads sharing memory that block in system calls independently and can pre-empt one another, and by default their memory is not shared with other processes.  They are both written mostly in C with some C++, and other programming languages are more or less obliged to use C calling conventions to interoperate.  Both of them use sockets for network I/O.

Are all seemingly good ideas actually good ideas?<p><i>But when through seeming coincidence some 96% of tech jobs are held by men I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s something larger afoot.</i><p>Through what seeming coincidence are 100% of NFL player jobs held by men? Or 80% of health-care jobs held by women?<p><i>My theory is sexism. It provides a testable hypothesis that has been proven multiple times. It makes predictions on other effects we&#x27;d see. Those have also been proven.</i><p>Sexism is (a) not mutually exclusive with group differences and (b) is, in many of its claimed forms, wildly inconsistent with many observable facts. As an exercise, I suggest you try making a list of such facts. You might start by listing job categories dominated by women. (I&#x27;ll get you going: health care, day care, education, publishing.) As a follow-up, try listing areas where men are objectively worse-off than women. (Maybe start with: homelessness, intellectual disability, autism, workplace fatalities, imprisonment, lifespan.)<p>If you scratch most supposedly definitive examples of unfairness caused by sexism, you&#x27;ll find some variant of the Blank Slate hypothesis underneath. Once you admit the possibility that men and women might <i>not</i> be blank slates, many of the patterns that appear to be &quot;sexist&quot; suddenly make sense. For example, many people assume that women and men have the same innate aptitude and inclination for &quot;tech&quot; (broadly defined). From this point of view, any deviations from &quot;equality&quot; (i.e., proportional representation) must derive either from overt sexism or from an endemic sexist culture. But when you accept the possibility that men and women may differ in more than stature and genitalia, suddenly it&#x27;s not so clear.<p><i>What&#x27;s yours?</i><p>Due to a combination of genetic and non-genetic differences, different groups are systematically different, and have different aptitudes and inclinations. Group differences lead to a first-order effect: all NFL players are male because all qualified players are male; some majority of those inclined to health care are female. The preponderance of a particular group also leads to a group culture reinforcing group identity. This leads to a second-order effect: female health-care workers create a feminine culture, attracting further female workers (while repelling male workers). This latter effect is sometimes called &quot;sexism&quot;, but it&#x27;s an inevitable consequence of human nature. Efforts to fight it will (a) cause massive collateral damage while (b) not working. (Has the Civil Rights Act of 1964 brought racial and gender harmony? It seems to me that in many ways things are worse than ever.)<p>I&#x27;d guess we actually agree on many things, and in particular we want many of the same outcomes—or, at least, I want a subset of the outcomes you want. Let&#x27;s say I want O and you want O + O&#x27;. Included in O is people of all races, colors, religions, genders, and national origins living prosperous, fulfilled lives free (as much as possible) of conflict and strife. Included in O&#x27; is the Civil Rights Act of 1964.<p>Often (as with the Civil Rights Act) the intent of policies in O&#x27; is to achieve outcomes in O, but I believe that not only does O&#x27; not achieve O, it frequently achieves not-O. Believers in O&#x27; would rather wreck college athletics with Title IX, or wreck the black community with welfare, than admit that O&#x27; doesn&#x27;t achieve its stated goals. That would lead to their being accused of &quot;sexism&quot; or &quot;racism&quot;, and O&#x27;-believers are as eager to avoid such accusations as they are quick to deploy them against their enemies. (Whereas I don&#x27;t care, because I see them for the Orwellian terms of abuse they are. Just call me a &quot;crimethinker&quot; and be done with it.)",1440819205

How could a fresh 18 year old adult possible give advice on how to balance your work and family life?<p>Edit: Now if you were to narrow the question to: What age of adviser is best for assisting a young high school grad with their transition to college life such a comparison might be more meaningful.",1440817904

Driverless elevators raised a  concern in regard to the safety of the elevator cab&#x27;s occupants in what was primarily a matter of private policy on private property. Essentially any public policy decision was about regulating the use of private property within private spaces and any citizen could opt out by taking the stairs.<p>On the other hand there are primary concerns with driverless cars in regard to the safety of non-occupants in the public commons and therefore it is primarily a matter of public policy regulating the use of private property in public spaces. The notion that opting out of public spaces is healthy for citizenship in general seems antithetical to a meaningful concept of citizenship in a liberal polity.<p>There are luddite concerns over self-driving cars.

We make stupid decisions, get tired, etc., but we manage to recover, workaround others&#x27; mistakes, etc.  I think people are underestimating how hard it will be to get &quot;the last 10%&quot; of driving skill, that gap between slapping together cruise control+camera+radar+GPS to be able to handle the best-case scenarios, and being able to drive at least as well as the average human in the average-case scenarios.<p>Another thought: what if it takes a generation or longer for self-driving cars to do well with cases like slippery rain or ice?  People will stop practicing how to drive at all, until suddenly one day they have to drive in the most dangerous conditions possible.  Will the net cost/casualties of accidents still be lower than it is today?",1440817682

That's how I did it, and I built to 15 employees while avoiding many (but not all!) of the common business basics blunders due to their assistance. If you find their advice valuable, you can even formalize a relationship with these advisers and provide a token number of warrants in exchange for a bigger time commitment.<p>I'm always happy to help people get started so feel free to email me.",1243734520

What if Zed's changes were accepted, as is, into the Python codebase today? What about when the next guy comes with his alternative APIs for option parsing and email along with a new standard for templates? Should they include them, too? How many completely different APIs for the same thing should they include in the standard library?<p>Any software system as large as Python is going to be imperfect -- it is constrained by backwards compatibility and conflicting requirements. However, Zed is free to build whatever he wants outside the core and make it available to the world. If it catches on enough, maybe his followers will go through the social process to get it into the core. This process helps to ensure consensus, consistency, and quality.<p>For a thoughtful response from a core Python developer, see Brett Cannon's blog post: <a href=""http://sayspy.blogspot.com/2009/05/staleness-of-standard-library-and.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sayspy.blogspot.com/2009/05/staleness-of-standard-lib...</a>.",1243733188

There's the Stephen Fry | Sockington style Twitter mediated humour, and that's fine but it's not enough to make me put up with the inane ""I'm drinking coffee now! OMG!"" drivel from so many people I vaguely know. Question is, what proportion of people enjoy that?

Ironically, he was probably one of the better informed people we've hired lately in terms of being aware of what his options are.<p>I seriously doubt I could do 2x better in industry, especially considering cost-of-living calculations.  And our location is an asset, liability.  Seriously; a gorgeous beach across the street from the office?  And you can actually afford a place on the water if you want?  You can't beat that.<p>I think you're basing your opinions on a mental image you have (and most people have) of who we are and what we do that is inaccurate.<p>As mentioned in the article, we were a separate company purchased last year.  We still operate fairly independently from our corporate overlords (someone actually used that reference when we were first meeting them).  We have exactly one layer of management for any given project.  Our customers work with a PM at most, but usually also directly with the engineers.<p>While I'm sure your criticisms are quite accurate for many large government jobs, for us (and a number of others I know of doing some similar work), the situation is quite different.<p>In regards to people working here because they don't know their other options, let me put it this way -- in the company's entire existence, we've had exactly two employees leave for another job, and it was to another small contractor, not the commercial sector.  I'd suggest it's unlikely that the retention rate is so high just because we're all so ignorant of our options.  There's a lot of reasons for it -- I'd be happy to talk about it more at Defcon if you're there this year.",1243733070

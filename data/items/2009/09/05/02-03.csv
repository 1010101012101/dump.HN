From the article:<p>...<i>11.6% of which admitted to having used file-sharing software</i><p>So what question were they asked? If I use Instant Messenger to send a photo to a friend, have I used 'file-sharing software'? Is Skype file sharing software? I used to write surveys that tried to get at issues like this (sw piracy), and I believe it is nigh-on impossible to get good data by asking a direct question in this way. You either make it very pointed (e.g. "".. used file-sharing software to illegal share files""), and then few people say <i>yes</i>, or you make is less specific, and people accidentally say <i>yes</i> because they don't understand it. That's the real problem.",1252119016

806092,comment,805645,805927,0,0,jnoller,,,"Minor correction. The removal of the GIL is not disallowed by fiat. The removal of the GIL was attempted (via granular locking) and destroyed single threaded performance. That's unacceptable for a variety of reasons. In the same thread, Guido has repeatedly stated that the GIL was a tradeoff, and he would welcome anything that helped lessen it's impact/remove it should it be proven not to significantly harm Python's primary function.<p>If someone showed up with a patch tomorrow which allowed free threading without seriously breaking python, or crippling single threaded performance, or making extension modules impossible to write, I could very well see it getting in. In reality, doing this requires a serious reworking of the interpreter (ala unladen swallow) to make it even feasible. There's a lot of things the GIL actually <i>helps</i>, for example the ease of writing c-based extension module, unfortunately they come with a price.<p>The price is/was seen as an acceptable tradeoff, and I think it has served it well, even if if it disappeared tomorrow no one would shed a tear.<p>Also, braces aren't a feature :p",1252118605

806090,comment,805402,805751,0,0,pradocchia,,,"[Unfortunate double post there...]<p>Point taken, though I do suspect there is a qualitative difference between solving Sudoku puzzles and practicing one's capacity for direct recall. Sudoku is algorithmic--you're focused on <i>how</i> to solve, rather than building up an index of solutions which you would then access by key.<p>eg, 6x7 is a key, the lookup yields 42, and you <i>could</i> work it out algorithmically, and that might include methods like ""type expression into Google"", but imagine if that was <i>all</i> you knew. No index of multiplication tables in your head. When you skimmed a text, your eyes would gloss ""6x7"" as ""multiplication product--undetermined"". There might be a pointer to a method to get the answer, but the <i>answer</i> itself wouldn't be directly available. It could be quite crippling.<p>Similarly with language: our facility of direct recall, our capacity for internalization, makes communication possible. If you are consciously working through the grammar that gives meaning to a phase, you have lost the discussion.<p>In programming, we get so much mileage out of the ""how"" that the ""what"" becomes incidental. Our mental map is a map of methods, where return values only persist long enough to call the next method. We know how we got there, but hardly remember any landmarks along the way.<p>So with phone numbers, we have lost one more opportunity to train and practice our capacity to create mental indexes to actual data. Why remember <i>one</i> number when you can remember <i>how</i> to get <i>all</i> numbers with less effort? Why store multiple keys when a single function will do?<p>People once developed algorithms to <i>create</i> vast mental indexes, eg. method of loci. One could commit incredible volumes of information to memory with such techniques.<p>Now compare that to the modern person w/ lazy evaluation in place of memorization. In memorization, lookup costs are zero. Consciousness stays focused on the matter at hand. Supporting data is pulled up as needed. Without memorization, consciousness must make repeated detours to supply the supporting data, or gloss over it all together.<p>I'd suggest that mastery of a subject occurs when consciousness can stop making these detours. When you know the behavior of various programming constructs by heart, you can stop checking the reference documentation at every turn.<p>So in aggregate, if you no longer know any phone numbers by heart, you may indeed be getting dumber.",1252118542

The fact that the lobbyist organisation paid for the original report was obscured by misattributing the source, which also seems dubious to me.<p>I don't doubt that political misuse of statistics is common, but it should always be called out.",1252117826

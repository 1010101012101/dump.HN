In “An Empire of Their Own,” Neal Gabler describes charity dinners of the 1930s where movie-industry moguls would gather at the Hillcrest Country Club and outbid one another with gifts to the United Jewish Welfare Fund and other Jewish causes.</i><p>Wow. The nytimes overtly claims that organizations devoted to advancing a particular race counts as ""public philanthropy"". That's no surprise to those of us who pay attention, but they usually don't make it so obvious.<p>As for charity, it is destructive of the human impulse for self-improvement which, understood properly, is anybody's only hope. The same celebrities who want to steal money from taxpayers in order to throw it away on Africa are the ones who want to shut down third world shoe factories because the workers don't get enough bathroom breaks.<p>Microfinance seems like a potential exception to that, but only to the extent that it stops being modeled on charitable grounds.",1205081985

132534,comment,132492,132511,0,0,mk,,,"I can kinda see where they are going with this. Although I would probably never use it (I very rarely send a letter by regular mail), I can think of some use cases where I could use it. My great grandma doesn't use email. I don't think she even has a computer. Every time her or my great grandpa would send me something it would come with at least a page of a letter just telling me about how they were doing. I also never seem to have any stamps. So in lieu of going out getting stamps and writing something on paper, and buying getting envelopes, I could just send an email. I mean if it is rare occasion why not? It's going to cost me like $20 for the stamps, maybe $10 for the envelopes. Thats just to send one letter. Now if I sent letters all the time the investment of stamps and letters would be worth it, but because the next time I am going to send one again will be months, years, whatever, I will probably lose the envelopes, the postage will be raised and I will need more stamps, and my grandma will never get a letter.",1205080844

It always seems to provoke a lot of discussion, and most people that react on it always seem to disagree with my point of view ;).<p>Unfortunately my main thought always seems to get lost. Maybe I should try to make it more clear in the article. In my opinion the core focus of software development, and therefore also the most difficult part, is to create an image of the real world (both in source code and the program). An engineer's main focus is completely different.",1205080826

132527,comment,132485,132485,0,0,Electro,,,"I completely disagree. It's shoddy and inefficient to wait for a problem to arrive. Imagine if the guys at Google just sat around waiting for their server to kick the bucket before they fixed it; they'd be out of business.<p>Problems aren't mutually exclusive, I can fix more than one at once. If my server is bust, it doesn't matter if my ISP is cutting me off in a week, but if all it takes is a call to another ISP to get another connection before the deadline then I'm not going to turn 1 week of having a downed server into two weeks with no useable service.<p>Only solving problems as they arrive is the work of the mediocre, the good fix things before they arrive. By your own example, the YouTube guys -didn't- think of copyrighted videos and they got a $1 billion lawsuit! That isn't a smart thing to allow to happen, if precident gets set against YouTube in one single case, they're broke and gone because they didn't think ahead.",1205080141
132526,comment,132492,132519,0,0,ejs,,,"The same way I am, I mail so rarely that I usually dont have any stamps, and when I do they are usually the wrong amount (seems to change often). So I need to spend the time to find the correct price, maybe go buy more stamps then mail it. If I could just use a service like this I would probably do it.
Although when I do have to mail things I usually have to include things so its a manual process anyway.<p>Maybe this is tailored to use for complain letters or threats that people don't want coming from their geographically location...?",1205080129

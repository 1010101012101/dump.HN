Sure those computers where far too immature and far too expensive to ever be mainstream, but the potential was there.  The iPad manages to bring the usability and price needed to make the concept more mainstream.  From here on in we'll seeing tablets just growing and growing.  The iPad may not be the device that becomes ubiquitous, but we look back upon it as the device that really started it all.",1275339594

[0]<p>* H1N1 vaccine supplies were limited during the period leading up to flu season. [1]<p>* H1N1 vaccine production was not ramped up quickly enough. [1]<p>* H1N1 vaccine was oversupplied after the 2009/10 flu season, leaving public health agencies with massive surpluses. [2]<p>So, given that public health agencies massively overstocked their supplies after they could do any good, it's easy to see why politicians might be angry. With oversupply in Germany alone at  €53.3 million worth of vaccine [2], a valid concern might be that if there was in fact corporate influence over the WHO decision to declare H1N1 a pandemic, then that would call their credibility into question [3]. Another concern might be that given the supply issues, the world is not able to effectively respond in time to a flu pandemic.<p>Rather than addressing those issues, it's a lot easier to paint critics as denialists.<p>Or, it could just be that they're wackos.<p>Whatever.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/05/health/05flu.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/05/health/05flu.html</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/WN/Health/h1n1-vaccine-deliveries-increase-manufacturers/story?id=9057889"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abcnews.go.com/WN/Health/h1n1-vaccine-deliveries-incr...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.thelocal.de/national/20100507-27035.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thelocal.de/national/20100507-27035.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.ihsglobalinsight.com/SDA/SDADetail18082.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ihsglobalinsight.com/SDA/SDADetail18082.htm</a>",1275339183

It almost certainly depends on the future limits of the mobile market (where low power is a bit more important than price), which I don't think we're in a position to confidently predict right now.  We know it'll be big, we don't know how big, and we don't know how much or when it will displace the existing order.<p>Final point: microprocessors usually align into one of four categories:<p>Zero cost (microwaves and dishwashers)<p>Zero units ($200K rad hard CPUs for space)<p>Zero power (the mobile market which ARM owns for that reason)<p>Zero time (to finish a computation)<p>ARM hasn't even tried to seriously compete in the latter until they came out with the multicore SMP out-of-order superscaler Cortex A9 ... and that's a 32 bit macroarchitecture.<p>Can they use their existing foundation to directly attack Intel in the Zero Time market?  Don't know, but I don't see it happening soon.<p>Will enough people abandon their 64 bit Intel systems for mobile 32 bit ARM systems, perhaps with the cloud handling the heavy lifting?

IQ scores correlate not only with academic performance but also with job performance as well as others' intuitive impression of how ""smart"" a person is.  That's why the army gives intelligence tests to new recruits: high-IQ soldiers (and mechanics and carpenters) do better, on average, than their low-IQ counterparts.  Other types of tests, such as the hypothetical test devised by Asimov's mechanic, either have no predictive power or are predictive only as far as they correlate with <i>g</i>, or general intelligence, which is currently best measured by IQ tests.  The physiological basis of <i>g</i> is unknown, but it is highly heritable and correlates with a number of physical variables such as brain volume and myelination.<p>If you want to learn more about the subject, I suggest this book, which concisely disposes of these and other popular anti-IQ arguments:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Question-Intelligence-IQ-Debate-America/dp/0806515074"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Question-Intelligence-IQ-Debate-Americ...</a>",1275338923

For example, combinatorial explosion is a very basic concept but I wouldn't have trouble believing that the majority of the US public wouldn't be able to grasp its consequences.<p>However I think that you may be inflating the degree to which we understand other fields a bit. I have taken just enough advanced physics to know that I know absolutely nothing about physics. Similarly for chemistry, biology, climatology, etc. My major is computer science so I would wager that I have a better than average knowledge in that field, but there are even some subfields in computer science (e.g., complexity theory) where I would be completely lost.<p>I think the concept in play here is what I like to call the ""hard science condition."" That is, people who are a member of the hard sciences or technical fields have a tendency to believe that because they have a good comprehension of a difficult subject they have a good comprehension of many difficult subjects (including other technical fields). This seems to me to be a logical fallacy because very rarely have the exhibitors actually put in the many years of work that would be required to really understand the field. In this way we all have to defer to experts at some point--that is, we must trust their results. This is why I think a scientific consensus is so important. When we must defer to experts it's important to be able to figure out what the experts are saying.",1275338104

Haven't yet used Tropo, but I think it's really interesting. Sorry for necroposting, but I just found this via search.<p>Twilio isn't indefinitely free for developing like Tropo, but they do give you $30 credit when you sign up, which goes a long way towards pre-production testing. Twilio can do international outbound calls, but as you say they don't yet have international inbound.<p>Twilio and Tropo both have a REST API. The main difference here is that you reply to Twilio with XML and Tropo uses JSON. Although proprietary, either one is easier to use than VoiceXML IMO.<p>Tropo has an amazing number of nice voices you can use to read off text to the caller. Twilio has just ""male"" and ""female"", last time I checked. On the other hand, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't see where Tropo could play an MP3 to the caller, whereas there are lots of ways to play recorded music or messages to the caller with Twilio. As far as recording, you have to give Tropo a place to send recordings, whereas Twilio will store the recordings for you. Twilio also has tons of API methods to access data, like list all your recordings, call logs, and so on. I don't see that for Tropo.<p>Hmm, this is getting long.

How about working with a lot of different computer nodes combining them with a fast network (Infiniband) and 
exporting the storage space through the cluster with a 
parallel file system?
How about optimizing every aspect of the software 
installation (OS, compilers, scientific libraries)

To not to mention follow the aspects regarding the structure of the data center: cooling systems, UPS, 
raised floors, etc.? It doesn't sound too bad to me :-)",1275336009

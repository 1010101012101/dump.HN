And it makes the city much nicer for everyone. As a middle-class professional, I don't need the social welfare system myself (at least, not currently), but I still do benefit from the quality of life that comes from living in a city with very low crime, relatively low poverty, and <i>reasonably</i> good (though far from perfect) economic equality.<p>Occasionally people do leave, whether for tax reasons or other reasons, but on the whole even the wealthy agree that the quality of life you get from living here is worth the expense paid in taxes, compared to moving somewhere that's more unequal and more violent. If anything I would guess there is a net influx of well-off people, and there would be more of one if immigration rules were loosened, to make it easier for wealthy people to move here from outside Europe.",1362837548

Actually, at the outset I thought it was impossible because of the way the sandboxing works on App Engine (writes to the file system are disallowed and the javax.tools.</i> package is not part of their white list). So straightforward approaches such as invoking the Java compiler from code will not work.<p>Here are various approaches that I have tried and the results:<p>1. Use Beanshell and approximate Java:<p>Beanshell is a scripting language for the JVM with Java like syntax. It also has a ""strict"" mode where it will behave like a strongly typed language.<p>Pros: you can run this on App Engine and can trust Google Engineers to worry about security of their sandbox. You also get the scalability of App Engine.<p>Cons: It is not really Java and language features like Generics are not supported. The error messages are also not as useful as what the regular Java compiler outputs.<p>2. Get users to compile code on their own machines and upload the .class file. Then write a class loader that will load this class and then execute whatever method you need to.<p>Pros: Works perfectly and no language issues.<p>Cons: The interactivity is lost to an extent. Also, beginners need to start worrying about installing Java and configuring CLASSPATH etc. from get go.<p>3. Use an in-memory compiler like Janino.\nPros: Works like the Java compiler and error messages are useful.<p>Cons: it does not support generics and it also does not support other features like the for(String value : values) {} syntax.<p>4. Use Google App Engine as the front-end and then run a compiler-as-a-service somewhere else (Linode etc.).<p>Pros: Full language and you are in control.<p>Cons: You better know how to sandbox the code (chroot / SecurityManager etc).<p>5. Use Google App Engine as a front-end and outsource compilation and execution to some other service like Ideone.<p>Pros: Full language support and someone else worries about security issues.<p>Cons: Expensive (the Ideone API only allows 1000 free submissions per month).<p>If you know some other method, please let me know. I love trying to see how to make things work on App Engine (I learn quite a bit this way).<p>(minor edits)",1362836133

5348301,comment,5347936,5348265,0,0,PommeDeTerre,,,"I think success requires much more than just some polish.<p>Based on the information available so far, it sounds like a very unappealing platform for developers. As a developer, you're essentially stuck using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I think this will drive away the best developers, who much prefer to use robust, mature languages like Java or Objective-C, rather than JavaScript. Likewise, the native frameworks of Android and iOS, for example, are much more pleasant and powerful to use than HTML and CSS.<p>It's not a recipe for success when good developers are driven away by a lousy technology stack. These are the developers that create the apps that really make a difference. Sure, a mediocre web developer may be able to create yet another to-do app for Firefox OS using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but the value in what they produce is extremely minimal.<p>Without good apps, users will want nothing to do with it. Even then, it looks doubtful that this will offer any real benefit over the numerous existing mobile platforms. With it so unclear why developers would want to adopt it, and with it so unclear why users would want to adopt it, it just looks so much like a dead end.",1362834739

One of those ports is 1Gbit (due to SoC limitations only 480Mbps though).  The other one seems to be connected via USB 2.0.

7518907,comment,7517862,7518651,4,0,rayiner,,,"That&#x27;s just not true. Deregulation in everything from telecommunications to highways to airlines to labor is real and the impact has been undeniable. For example, airline deregulation in 1977 enabled FedEx and UPS to buy airplanes, enabling the modern era of package delivery and companies like Amazon. People fail to appreciate just how regulated things were in the 1970&#x27;s. Measures that agencies wouldn&#x27;t dream of today, like outright rate setting, were commonplace back then.<p>Assertions to the effect of &quot;the government is bigger than ever&quot; are just unsubstantiated hand-waving. Federal spending as a percentage of GDP, excluding interest, social security, and medicare, is down from 15% to 10%. That reflects a real and dramatic shrinking of the scope of government.<p>You can argue that deregulation hasn&#x27;t had the same impact proponents suggested, but it&#x27;s all relative. Industries with economics of scale tend towards monopoly or duopoly in the absence of regulation. The fact that deregulated industries still often exhibit oligopolies isn&#x27;t proof that deregulation was just rhetoric. Search, desktop operating systems, consumer microprocessors, and package delivery have all trended towards having one or two dominant players, yet those industries never had regulated monopoly incumbents.",1396471841

With the exception of the TI&#x27;s OMAP5, all of the A15 implementations I know of are under lock and NDA and even though Bunnie could source them, the documentation and software support packages would not be as easy and would require working closely with the manufacture to get them. I have no idea about OMAP5 as I haven&#x27;t even seen one in production. Most mobile ARM processors AFAIK do not support gigabit ethernet yet, save a few Marvell SoCs (less for mobile and more for other embedded).<p>Smartphones designed with modern ARM processors require teams of 2 dozen engineers working their asses off for months to make a single revision, and this is when they&#x27;re partners with the chip manufacturers (ala Google, Apple, or Samsung). Bunnie is working with a much smaller team and with different constraints.<p>Any board like this is going to be expensive to manufacture and assemble. Even if he were to do a run of 100 units at a time, the overhead of assembly and part purchases in such low quantities are likely to run $100+ a unit. Combine with the extra support costs of including an FPGA in there, and it&#x27;s not unreasonable to charge so much for such a niche, low quantity product.<p>Edit: Also Freescale is on the low end of the high end ARM market and they know it.

If you give your words to someone else, he might not be able to speak them.<p>In the same way, if you give control of some money to someone else, they will be the ones responsible for how it gets spent, not you.

It was a fascinating time to be a techie in a news organisation, because it was fairly obvious to us that one day the internet would eat every aspect of the business - advertising, classifieds and eventually even news itself.<p>The websites we had were rickety old classic ASP apps (remember when people wrote JavaScript on the server?!) One of my biggest projects was building the platform for analytics on all our pages. The only reason the business wanted this was so they could get their traffic numbers properly audited to sell advertising more easily, but we wanted to provide more value than that. We had reports showing the most popular stories by day, month, category etc, as you&#x27;d expect, and we thought perhaps this would be useful on the print side of the business too. The most wildly popular stories were exactly what you&#x27;d expect (&quot;Stab victim vicar&#x27;s child porn shame&quot;, that sort of rubbish) but obviously the front pages of the papers were all about roundabouts and fences falling down.<p>Every month we gave them the data, every month they ignored it when making editorial decisions. Partly just because nobody really cared about the internet or what it thought, partly, I would hope out of some sense of public service or long term gain. Rounds and rounds of job losses later, I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;re doing anything differently.<p>Either way, it&#x27;s fascinating that a decade on, in the face of much more data, and much more existential risk to individual news organisations, that this same argument can still play out the same way, even in businesses that are more or less _native_ to the internet.",1396471114

Drug laws, war on terror, militarization of police, copyright and patent expansion, the massive and growing number of prisoners (more in absolute numbers than China!), money transmitter laws, safety regulations, the NSA, the perpetually growing number of federal and state regulations per year, etc are usually cited (also, many libertarians throw in growing welfare spending, which I&#x27;m obliged to include even though I personally find it vastly less offensive than something like throwing black people in jail for a parking ticket). There is actually a good theory that explains the disparity between this and the high-profile deregulation cases: in the case of laws that substantially harm very specific and powerful groups, there is a strong and concentrated interest in repealing them, so they get repealed. On the other hand, in the case of micro-nuisances targeting small entrepreneurs fighting against the law a public goods problem, where each individual person has insufficient incentive to do anything about it.",1396471065

Thanks for your question!<p>Regarding the 3rd party issue: \nAll donation methods (RaisedBy.Us or otherwise) involve a third party.  Even when you go directly to a charity&#x27;s website to make a donation, you will use a third party payment provider.  The most common method is debit or credit card.  This method actually involves multiple third parties that all take fees (an issuing bank, a merchant bank, a settlement bank and a network such as VISA, Mastercard, Discover, etc).  This fee is called interchange and it typically inovlves a flat fee of 30 cents per transactions plus about 2.5% to 3% of the total value of the transaction.  We thought this was pretty expensive.  Donations through RaisedBy.Us charge 0% and no flat fee per transaction.  We accomplish this by using a back-end provider that settles transactions with charities using checks and ACH methods (which are much cheaper the credit and debit transactions) and we charge the companies (not the donors) to access the service.<p>Regarding tax write off: RaisedBy.Us does not get a tax write-off for the donations that are processed through our program.  Only the initial donor (e.g., an employee at one of our participating companies) gets a tax write-off for donations.",1396469277

I&#x27;m extremely excited for the future of Microsoft, and backtracking on the Start Menu helps prove that they know what they&#x27;re doing.<p>Okay, NOW they know what they&#x27;re doing.",1396468883

It&#x27;s not my natural form of communication; also, when it extends beyond just the greeting, it can become difficult and frustrating.<p>I find it not very efficient nor productive towards actually understanding the other person or situation and reaching a useful mutual understanding, whether just at a social level or in the course of some specific problem solving.<p>Again, this may not &quot;make sense&quot; to some reading my comment.  But it is the way I and I think some others experience dealing with things such as &quot;How are you?&quot; and &quot;(Very) Good/Great/Fine...&quot; and &quot;Well&quot;, of course... as evaluating to &quot;Hey&quot; or even [null expression].<p>The flipside is that the other party does genuinely communicate, we tend to be able to communicate a much greater understanding more quickly and with fewer errors and need for longer term follow-up and repetition.  In my experience...<p>People can sometimes be frustrated with the amount I communicate.  Until they realize later that I actually though of and told them exactly what they needed to know to deal with a situation, and they didn&#x27;t have to come back and ask me anything further -- nor correct a mistake caused by a lack of understanding.<p>Over time, they tend to learn that if I am telling them something, it is probably for a good reason -- even if they don&#x27;t see it, yet.",1396468804

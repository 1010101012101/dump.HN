You will never see a lot of hand-holding in programming.<p>Manuals and references for programming languages tell you about the syntax and major features but demand endless curiosity on your part to answer your own questions. Tutorials may give you how-tos for certain specific problems but usually fail to explain basic concepts. College courses usually give both how-tos and conceptual information but are usually targeted towards the abstract. In all cases you have to provide the ""sweat equity"" of writing stuff, failing, testing, retrying, etc.<p>The most well-rounded introductory literature I've seen is in textbooks. Other programming books are aimed at existing programmers that are transitioning to new languages, learning new concepts, etc.<p>My suggested starter set for someone intending to write web apps would include several textbooks, a book on SQL, the reference to the web language you wish to use(don't fret too much about this, it's almost a coin toss when you haven't tried using any), and a book on web frameworks for your language. The textbooks will often want to use languages that are not popular web languages, but that can be a benefit, as it teaches you what is really different between these languages, and how to focus on the concepts.<p>You can start by making sense of the things described in the textbooks and rewriting their examples in the language you want to use. Gradually the frameworks will look more approachable and you can start working with the examples in those. At that point - some months down the line - you may be able to get serious about your app.",1235175664

As soon as you start typing it puts a file in $HOME/Documents (or a configurable alternative). If the application is amenable to guessing a title (like the first entry in Heading 1), then it uses that, otherwise it goes with the usual ""untitled"". The menu ops are File -> Open, File -> Save, File -> Save a copy, File -> Set name and File -> Move. The last file opens if you stop and restart. Every single operation gets lazy-queued for flush to disk on an activity log (more than just auto-save: preserve every undo-able op).

He's looking at the tip of the iceberg - quality compilers for popular languages - and assuming that's all there is.<p>If you're by yourself or on a small team, it's a waste of your time to build a parser for a language by scratch. You might be able to produce a better-performing parser if you implement it yourself, but the performance of your compiler isn't even a second-order concern, it's a third or fourth order concern. I say this because you're going to care about the performance of the code you <i>generate</i> far before you care about the performance of the compiler itself. On par with that is, of course, language features. If your language features require a change in the grammar, it's much easier to change a grammar file than to muck around in your own implementation.<p>Popular compilers do take time to optimize parsing, but very few compilers have to handle the strain that the likes of gcc and MSVC do.<p><i>Unfortunately, that seems to be where my formal education ends, because I just can't figure out why lexical analysis is supposed to be so difficult.</i><p>It's not difficult.

I checked out most of the links so far and BarCamp (definitely plan to attend), Betahouse, and Open Coffee look cool, I'll have to try those out. Any good presentations/events are also of interest, I'll keep on top of those and check as many as I can.<p>Also, as many pointed out, my e-mail was indeed not visible in my profile (it was in the e-mail field instead). It's now in the profile.<p>I'd also second the idea of the ""hacker network"" within/in place of the profile section. Fields for geography, interests, programming experience/language preferences would be great, though I'd still like to see it left to each person to provide as much/little of that info as they'd like. Also, in the geography area, people could post links to fun/interesting events so others in that area would have a quick way of finding out about them while reading HN.",1235174703

489446,comment,488567,488567,0,0,dmolnar,,,"One neat thing about R is that it's become standard in academic statistics to include an R implementation of your new idea with a journal paper. For example, Gareth James and his colleagues came up with a new method called the Gauss-Dantzig estimator for doing prediction in the case where the number of parameters is much larger than the number of data points. You can download the R code from his research web page here:\n<a href=""http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~gareth/research/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~gareth/research/</a><p>This makes it much, much easier to try out new prediction methods on your own data. No more having to write code from the paper's description and hoping (praying) that you got it not entirely wrong! Instead you can use the researcher's own code to quickly figure out if the new method is better or worse than previous methods on your own data.<p>That being said, R does take a lot of getting used to. Graphics in general are tricky, although the ggplot2 package makes some things easier and can produce pretty results:\n<a href=""http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/</a><p>There also isn't a great story for using R on massive data sets which don't fit in main memory, so far as I know. It doesn't take much before you start hitting data for which an algorithm that requires O(n^2) memory will eat > 15 GB of RAM. At that point you're out of the territory of Amazon instances you can rent cheaply and into building a box just for R, or you're into refactoring your data so you can do the computation in pieces. So you do have to watch out for that a bit when using the default packages.",1235174699

Right now its completely empty and lacks sufficient power and ethernet ports.

We all have our own ideas as to what kind of tables we'd like, how we'd like the space to feel, etc... but none of us have the expertise to get it all out on paper.<p>Have any of you brought in professional designers or architects to design your spaces? What kind of costs might we expect with having someone design our 2000 sq. ft. office?<p>We're also having a pretty hard time convincing our CEO to really invest in this move into the new area.

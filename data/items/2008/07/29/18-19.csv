They <i>already</i> have records (including SSN/Tax ID, name, address, etc.) for every person and business in the country, so I don't see how this could possibly be some major new security risk.<p>The argument about gross revenues is vacuous, too, since the entire point is to compare the <i>reported</i> gross and deductions against the known online revenues. You're expected to include all your income in a tax return, deduct where appropriate, and pay your fair share of tax. This new reporting scheme really just reduces the odds that someone could dramatically under-report their revenue without the IRS noticing.<p>It may also be worth remembering that the IRS already has the right to ask for bank records during an audit, so this won't give them access to any information they couldn't get their hands on already.",1217357793

260922,comment,260017,260017,0,0,sethg,,,"IMHO (based on my reading, and based on my observations of a certain organization where I went to college), the distinguishing feature of a cult is the exploitation of <i>unanimous peer pressure</i> (cf. the Asch conformity experiment) to make everyone follow <i>one charismatic dictator</i>.<p>E.g. you give all your money to The Guru because that's what a loyal follower of The Guru does, and all the people you hang out with are loyal followers of The Guru.  All the people you hang out with are loyal followers of The Guru because they love you so much and they have so many things for you to do together and go on all these lovely weekend retreats where you are told that if you hang out with someone who's not a loyal follower of The Guru then it would be very bad for your karma.<p>The unanimity and the single leadership make cults different in kind, and not just different in degree, from other kinds of organized goal-seeking human groups.

I think the recent submission ""YC is a cult"" (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=260017) is a great example of something that should probably be ranked higher for longer because of all the discussion.",1217354742

In the same period, they burned $200K on operating activities, and only avoided bankruptcy ($14K at the beginning of the quarter!) with a $300K cash infusion from investors.  They would've been dead in another month and a half.<p>Talk about playing chicken!",1217354741
260869,comment,260679,260679,0,0,goodgoblin,,,"Ok -I've worked on a startup on the side for almost 3 years now - and so far no real success - I'm starting to cringe at the lost opportunity cost and am thinking that I should go back to school.  I can't leave the immediate area due to family constraints - so I'm limited to local institutions. I can probably get into either an MBA, Masters in CS or Law degree program.  Which do you all think is a better fit?  Or is there something to be gained in a spectacular failure of the startup (i.e. maybe more likely to get venture next time around)?<p>A little more background - the programs are 'rated' around 50th or so in the country - and I will likely never work in a totally high tech industry - (working in IT now within another field (i.e. enterprise)).",1217354741

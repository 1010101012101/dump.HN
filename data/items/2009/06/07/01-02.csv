It also regulates, funds, and grants degrees itself.<p>Examples include credential requirements for many different occupations, licensing laws, and job eligibility.<p>Of course, there are also the more ""unofficial"" effects of these policies.

645399,comment,644841,645308,0,0,mahmud,,,"I agree with you completely; Erlang is indeed the best tool for the job, if you know it well. But my point is that none of the other tools he glossed-over make high-performance server programming impossible; in fact, it's trivial in most of them.<p>As a matter of fact, Erlang is the only one in that list that has a bondage-and-discipline evaluation model and runtime; all others allow you to interface with native system calls and you will get your requests the instant they arrive and you can process them in $HLL of your choice.<p>His application domain does not at all suggest a requirement for seamless distribution. A poker server! And if you look closely at the languages of his choice, you see that he didn't have a clear idea; Delphi?<p>He could have easily ""distributed"" the application with primitive load balancing. Have a single server handle requests and player signups up to a certain high water mark. I mean, how many players are in a given poker table anyway? Then direct new requests to your standby backup server. Repeat, in round-robin fashion.<p>By the way, I remember him from comp.lang.lisp; and my memory might have tainted my judgment of the article.<p>Also, a lot of $HLL programmers have this weird prejudice about C and proper systems programming. They want to do everything in $HLL, down to <i><insert lowest threshold></i>. That's silly, C is the native language of most OSes, use it for its power, but only just where necessary.",1244339205

Speculation: did they take a load of probable phrases from the dictionary and describe how each will function in the level?

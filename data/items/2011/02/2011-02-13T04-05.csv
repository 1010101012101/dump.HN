The ""empty"" feeling of dilution, and the absence of <i>real content</i>, are issues our team are tackling head-on, with full awareness of such pitfalls. As an example, I was raised on the early Final Fantasy games. A huge, huge part of their appeal was the music — beautiful themes with expert execution by a masterful composer (Nobuo Uematsu). Even now, 20 years later, I have friends who grew up playing the same games who still remember the music. We can hum the themes to one-another, and reminisce about our youth beguiling away many an afternoon absorbed in the stories of these virtual worlds.<p>But if the stories were procedurally generated, or the music, or any other ""hook"" that will be remembered by the player, the shared experience is suddenly lost. People may play the same ""title"", but they haven't played the same game. This is a big, big challenge — how do you leverage the power of dynamically generated content, without breaking the consistency of experience within your game and the commonality of experience between players. How do you create shared memories?<p>It's easy enough to take a game like Diablo, where the maps are random, or Boarderlands, where the weapons are random, and discuss the game with someone else, arriving at a shared impression and similar memories of play. But if the maps, weapons, quests, characters, sounds, music, rendering style, dialogue, plot, gameplay rules, setting, and even game genre are in some way ""generated""... how can you still have a shared experience?<p>Whoever comes out with a solution to that will be doing some fascinating work.<p>Also, from what I've heard, the next Elder Scrolls (Morrowind, Oblivion) game is going to have some aspect of procedurally determined quests. I'm excited to see how they do that, as it's not so often that a big studio like Bethesda takes on such an unproven concept.",1297572444

Much of the privacy/data mining/etc issues stem from the fact that advertisers are the customers, not the users.

Would people pay it?  At that point, it's really not the cost that's an issue, it's the hassle of signing up.<p>I do really like the idea of an aggregator service where the providers receive a cut of the subscription.

2212060,comment,2211108,2211933,0,0,spiralganglion,,,"We've got a few games in the pipe, and none of them are open-world. It's a common assumption that games with some procedural aspect come out as sprawling ""canvases"" for free-form play — that you'll be stuck in the sandbox if you want to play with procedural environments. Where in fact, our game currently in active development has a tiny environment. You can see the whole thing on one screen, with your character occupying about 1% of the area. The environment is continuously procedurally generated <i>as the game is running</i>, constantly shifting and changing without really expanding, per se. The player's reaction to their ever-changing surroundings is a big part of the fun. The gameplay is rooted in kinetic action, where spacial relationships are manipulated by the player. It's an arcade-style game, with the player's character pitted against a screenful of enemies. Attacks don't cause damage as much as create movement, and it's the movement of the character and enemies with respect to the (somewhat predictably) shifting environment that creates the flow of gameplay. I'd be more specific, but we're not quite ready to reveal the whole concept. It's quite a bit different than anything we've seen before, so we're being careful about having the product ready to launch before we start showing off the more unusual and exciting qualities.<p>In addition to procedurally generated, constantly evolving environments.. we've got procedurally re-composed music (my background is in algorithmic music composition). Re-composed, meaning the music is based on human-written themes, but the arrangements are done in realtime by the computer. We're also playing with procedural generation of enemies, to create a lot of variety with relatively little effort. That is, they'll look <i>and</i> behave differently depending on the outcome of the procedural generation.",1297571464

I'm not saying it's always that way, but that's a very real trap people can fall into.  The issue is that the player loses motivation after the Nth quest to kill X things for $reason.<p>A better system would work to create a strong motive for the player to perform the quest.  It could be as simple as the monster doing something to really piss the player off and making them want to go after it for revenge.<p>But the problem is that you don't want to keep using the same tricks too often.  If you can find a good way to combine N tricks into N! reasonable combinations, that's great, but every time you pull the same trick twice, you cheapen it a little, because players will see the patterns eventually.  Seriously, there are crazy people who play games using spreadsheets to plot out exact damage formulas and stuff.  I suspect those kids will grow up to be accountants :)<p>Anyhow, my main point was that procedural generation is a very powerful and very cool tool, but it needs to be used to augment your game, not to dilute it.  There's a temptation among some people out there to use it to avoid having to make any real content, which creates the ""empty"" feeling I spoke of before.<p>I believe that the people who avoid that temptation and create undiluted games with procedurally generated content will be the ones whose games are played for decades to come.",1297570802

2212032,comment,2210026,2211127,0,0,dkarl,,,"Problem solving relies on a lot of muscle memory.  Imagine doing a calculus problem when you have to painstakingly work your way through every algebraic operation:<p><pre><code>  x^2 + 3x - 3x^2 + 3x + 5
  x^2 - 3x^2 + 3x + 3x + 5
  1x^2 - 3x^2 + 3x + 3x + 5
  (1 - 3)x^2 + 3x + 3x + 5
  -2x^2 + 3x + 3x + 5
  -2x^2 + (3 + 3)x + 5
  -2x^2 + 6x + 5
</code></pre>
Okay, what problem was I solving again?  What does this have to do with what I was learning?  What was I going to do next?<p>When you have to concentrate on grouping and reducing polynomials, it's next to impossible to solve any kind of interesting calculus problem, much less learn anything, because you don't have any time to think about calculus.  It's boring to do math that way, not to mention anxiety-inducing, because you spend all your time worrying about getting the old stuff right.  But that's the way teachers are supposed to teach math:  once the kids can work their way through one kind of problem somewhat reliably, they are supposed to move on before it becomes routine.  That leads to a pretty sorry state of affairs -- the kids have to think hard about <i>everything</i> they do.  You shouldn't think hard about algebra while you're doing calculus.  When you can do the algebra quickly using your muscle memory:<p><pre><code>  x^2 + 3x - 3x^2 + 3x + 5
  -2x^2 + 6x + 5
</code></pre>
Then you get to spend your time actually thinking about calculus, the stuff you're supposed to be learning and exploring.<p>The thing about problem solving is that it's just one end on a continuum from exploration to mastery.  When you say ""the core of math is problem solving"" you're basically saying all the fun and glory is in exploration.  It's true!  I don't disagree at all.  All I'm saying is that you can't have exploration without mastery, because you explore new territory using the tools you've previously mastered.  Trying to learn calculus when you haven't mastered algebra, when algebra isn't part of your ""muscle memory,"" is backwards and frustrating.<p>My favorite example of this is freshman college physics.  Different people have vastly different experiences of freshman physics.  For kids who are pretty good at calculus, freshman physics is amazing.  It's a year-long parade of learning cool, powerful ideas and using them to solve challenging problems.  For kids who haven't mastered calculus, freshman physics is a horrific calculus death march.  They spend ten minutes setting up some equations (the only part that relates to the fascinating new stuff they learned in class) and then spend an hour trying to make the answers come out right.  They spend ten hours doing the weekly problem set and wonder why it's so boring and why they're having such a hard time learning physics.  It's because in that ten hours they spent one hour thinking about physics and nine hours struggling with calculus!  When students spend ten hours working and only get one hour's worth of exposure to the course material, it's no wonder they struggle in the class.  The kids who <i>enjoy</i> physics are the ones who spend ten minutes setting up the equations and then five minutes solving them.  Those kids get to spend most of their time thinking about the fun stuff:  interesting concepts and problems.<p>The difference is that the first group of kids ""sees a problem of the form 'A B C'"" and just solves it.  The second group of kids, when solving the calculus equations, has to think through the concepts and ""problem solve.""  That would be great if they were learning calculus, but since they're trying to learn physics, it's an interruption that detracts from their learning.  A skill has to feel routine, even boring, before it can serve as the basis of learning another skill.  Shaky fundamental skills are like the intrusive noises in ""Harrison Bergeron"" -- they make it very hard to maintain a coherent train of thought about anything else.<p>So you can't problem-solve and have fun in freshman physics until calculus is routine.  How do calculus computations become routine if, in calculus class, the teacher is supposed to stop drilling you as soon as you figure out how to think your way through each problem?  If the goal is for the computations to become routine, then boring practice problems are exactly what you need.  (I suspect in your case, the problem was that you needed less practice than the other kids, and you had to keep practicing long past the point where it really would have been appropriate to move on.)<p>You might say that if some kids are never going to go beyond calculus and will never do any hard-core science coursework in college, then it's appropriate to just teach them the concepts of calculus and not worry about their ability to solve problems.  Well, that's fine.  But they will have a hell of a time learning the concepts of calculus if algebra and trigonometry monopolize their attention.  The only class where it is appropriate to shoot for ""understanding"" without skills is the last math class a student will ever take.",1297570668

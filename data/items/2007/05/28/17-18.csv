If you are writing it from a low level, you will FAIL. \nPlanning requires people with wisdom, vision and conscious experience.  . . .   A person who has no conscious of what is going on, usually live on the seat of their pants.  ... Reader!  Who is planning for your company?   Do they know the big picture from a ""top down tangible viewpoint""?  (Where we are at, We call it a Tangible Vision.) From the strategic classics: One who excels at warfare will await events in the situation without making any movements. When he sees he can be victorious he will arise; if he see he cannot be victorious he will desist. Thus it is said he doesn't have any fear, he doesn't vacillate.

211895,story,,,10,25,andreyf,"Ask YC: agressive non-compete/non-solicitation agreement",,"I'm about to sign on to a NYC-based startup on Monday, and this part of the non-compete agreement they sent me raises a flag:<p><pre><code>  Covenant Not to Compete: The Employee agrees that for a period of twenty-four (24) months following termination\n  of the Employee’s employment with the Company for any reason, the Employee will not, directly or indirectly, own,\n  manage, control or participate in the ownership, management or control of, or be employed or engaged by or\n  otherwise affiliated or associated as a consultant, independent contractor or otherwise with any other corporation,\n  partnership, proprietorship, firm, association, or other business entity that is engaged *in any manner in the \n  Business of the Company in any market (including the Internet market)* located in the United States as well as\n  outside the United States in which the Company markets any of its products or services.\n</code></pre>\nAm I right interpreting this as saying that I can't work for internet related companies if I leave the company? Is this unenforceable boilerplate legalese that I shouldn't worry about, or something to discuss?<p>Another provision which bothers me is one that says I won't (for 24 months) ""Employ, assist in employing, recruit or otherwise associate in business with any present, former or future employee"". Is this something that's worth challenging?<p>I don't fully understand some of the other concepts in the agreement - things like definitions of ""Reasonableness"" and ""Toll Period"", which seem to be based on particular cases or laws - what is a good place to read up on this?",1212897459

If you just minify and gzip Prototype, you're looking at a much lighter footprint.<p>In the end, none of the frameworks are very lean: though Mootools and YUI are at least modular.",1212896001

That doesn't mean it's true.<p>On the other hand, Perl does make it easier to write unreadable code.

211870,comment,211461,211461,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Here's an off-the-cuff prediction: Twitter itself, as well as the Twitter community, will be just fine. In a year or two nobody will remember these problems.<p>Twitter may have scaling problems, but it's not as if their potential competitors are magically immune to those. Meanwhile, Twitter holds a <i>huge</i> marketing advantage -- you can't say ""Site X is just like Twitter"" without saying ""Twitter"" -- and a big Metcalfe's Law advantage: Everyone who is remotely interested in Twitter-like sites already has a Twitter account, and those accounts won't magically disappear. Meanwhile, there will be more than one Twitter competitor, all desperately trying to distinguish themselves from each other as well as from the original.<p>Sooner or later Company X will figure out how to scale Twitter. At which point either Company X buys Twitter for the name and the userbase, Twitter buys Company X for the technology, or Google buys everybody. Or, Twitter eventually reverse-engineers the superior architecture, at which point they will beat Company X over the head with superior name recognition and larger userbase. This is <i>especially</i> true if Company X is actually the open-source community -- if some random Python programmer manages to create a superior, open-source Twitter architecture, Twitter will just install it on a server farm within a month and be right back in the game. The open-source movement has a lot of brilliant techies, but I doubt that its marketing team can outrace Twitter's from a standing start.<p>The Twitter concept has enough mindshare that I doubt it can just evaporate. They're not being sued out of existence like Napster. I'm not convinced that a scalable Twitter is <i>physically impossible</i>. So I would suggest that rumors of its death are greatly exaggerated. It's just... resting.",1212895352

211868,comment,211782,211782,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"I've used all three of the languages you mention for relatively large web applications. People will say PHP sucks because it is ugly and retarded and only has one namespace. People will say Python sucks because of the whitespace issue and mod_python doesn't work on a $5/m shared hosting plan. Perl sucks of course because ""the syntax is crazy!""  But, huge sites are built in PHP (Facebook, Hype Machine, Flickr, half of Yahoo!), Python (much of Google) and Perl (craig's list). In my experience they are all about equivalent except for aesthetic reasons.<p>The headaches in a web app are usually at the user interface level (DOM/CSS/Javascript) and at the systems level (there's a bug in fast cgi! MySQL imploded!) and language choice gluing it all together is mostly a matter of taste. People with taste overestimate its importance. You can get pretty far in the internet biz with no taste (MySpace... originally done in COLD FUSION).<p>That said, the most tasteful option out of your choices is Python.",1212895174
211867,comment,211782,211782,0,0,sachinag,,,"I spent a lot of time bellyaching about this when starting my company - looking at PHP, Perl (preferred by the devs), and Python (preferred by the advisers I trust).<p>In the end, we went PHP, and it was hugely lucky - we were able to hire a couple of devs on very short notice because we were in PHP, even though we use a less popular framework called Qcodo.  After they were hired, I asked them what they thought, and there was no way they were going to learn a new language to join us, but they were ok learning a new framework.<p>My feeling is that PHP has the largest base of developers out there, and that means that you've got the biggest base of potential co-workers.  If you yourself are a great hacker, you can prop up whoever else you're working with.  If you're building an app/business to scale, you have to have other hackers join you.<p>Hell, Apple has a hard time finding Objective C hackers, and they're Apple.",1212895109

3465754,comment,3465521,3465521,11,0,digisth,,,"Very good article. I think we should also consider the /reasons/ many consciously avoid ""known/well understood"" schleps. They have to do with the motivations for undertaking the work involved with a startup (or anything else, but startups for this argument) in the first place. Paths of least resistance are going to be taken if they satisfy the goals. Basically, the issue in the cases I'm speaking of is _satisficing_.<p>1) If you want to hang out with ""cool startup people"" and be involved in ""cool startup culture"" just about any startup will do. No need to do something difficult. That recipe aggregator will do just fine.<p>2) If you want to work on ""interesting"" problems, there are lots of those too. They might not serve many people (dev tools which do the same thing as many other existing dev tools and do not improve upon them) or change the world in really useful ways, they can still be /interesting/ to work on.<p>3) If you just want to make enough money so that you can stop stressing out every single day of your worry-filled life over having to work yourself to the bone for the rest of your life/becoming homeless/being able to afford food/shelter/health insurance, and you think just about any startup can give you that Startup Lottery Ticket, you don't need to work on the next Stripe. You just need a couple of million, then you could move into your one room studio/log cabin/pod and live the rest of your life sans the typical day-to-day worries about the basics and be just fine. The diminishing marginal utility of money seems like an excellent bulwark against trying to do those Schleppier things. If you're going to make at <i>least</i> as much from a RecipeAggregator472 as you would from a Stripe, the choice is easy.<p>As pg states, undertaking these sorts of endeavors requires ignorance for some, but I would also add some other possible useful motivators (ignorance may also become tougher ""motivator"" since so much useful data about failure is so readily available):<p>1) The need for big money for other goals. If you want to be a mega-philanthropist/cure cancer/finally solve immortality/whatever, you probably need BIG BUCKS. The number of people motivated to actually do this (or who even think it is possible) is probably not very large.<p>2) Fanaticism. You want to make this project happen because it's just your dream. The rewards are irrelevant. You will make it so that it's possible to create coffee from rain no matter what it takes, it's just that important to you. Probably not that many of these either.<p>3) Revenge. Everyone told you it could not, can not, and will not be done. Maybe they told you that you will never be the Coffee From Rain King. Whatever the reason, you live to prove them wrong and rub their faces in it. You want to get on the news and blithely tell the world about you invented this genius thing while making no mention of your detractors, but you secretly giggle with glee since you know you were Right, and they were Wrong. This one might actually be the easiest of the bunch, but still requires a delicate balance of just enough ridicule and scorn to motivate one, but not so much so that one\none thinks said thing is truly impossible.<p>4) Reinforcing the Peltzman effect. Certainly not a panacea either, but it could certainly help: <a href=""http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/01/peltzman-effect-why-economic-growth-has.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/01/peltzman-effect-why-eco...</a>",1326585359

3465737,comment,3465521,3465521,30,0,corin_,,,"An interesting piece, but I think a flawed one too.<p>I am in complete agreement with the section about ""<i>you can't start a startup by just writing code</i>"", and I think that concept could have expanded to become an entire and valid article.<p>But then it morphed from that into the idea that people (often subconciously) avoid ""schleps"" and pick easier tasks instead, which I think is both obvious and normal. I also think it is often a lot less subconcious than pg thinks.<p>To expand on the example of olympic athletes: I don't know about that specific example, but to expand to ""professional athletes"", an awful lot of people do think about being a football star, a top baseball player, whatever. But ultimately, even children with dreams have a basic understanding of risk vs. reward.<p>Saying that starting stripe involves a lot of schleps is one way of putting it, another way is to say that you're less likely to succeed.<p><i>Probably no one who applied to Y Combinator to work on a recipe site began by asking ""should we fix payments, or build a recipe site?"" and chose the recipe site. Though the idea of fixing payments was right there in plain sight, they never saw it, because their unconscious mind shrank from the complications involved.</i><p>Other than gut instinct is there any reason to believe this is the case? Those people also chose to start a recipe site over becoming journalists, or chefs, or working in fashion - nobody has ever, before starting either a career or a startup, gone through every possibility and ticked them all off, so why is it that in this case we should assign subconcious fear of hard work s the reason?<p>Personally I find it can often be the reason conciously, to the extent that I don't believe it has any need to be in my subconcious. Much like when I'm in a casino and think ""let's bet fairly small"" rather than ""risk my entire savings to have a chance at getting crazily rich"", when it comes to work I conciously think about how hard something will be, and what rewards it could bring.<p>Personally I work in content/publishing, and no it never occured to me to work on Stripe, but thinking about it now, if I could go back in time, I wouldn't try to build Stripe first, nor would I at this point in time consider a job in that kind of company. Maybe part of that can be assigned to the schelps involved, but I'm conciously deciding that.<p>Regardless, an interesting piece as food for thought.<p>edit: As a completely unrelated question that doesn't really merit creating an entire topic to ask, does anyone with showdead enabled have any idea what comments like <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3465559"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3465559</a> are all about?

However, I like to use the following slightly devil's advocate-y argument that readability usually matters more than just about any other property of code, including correctness and good performance.<p>(In the absence of any standard definitions, let us take ""readability"" to mean ""ease of extracting useful information from the code"" and ""maintainability"" to mean ""ease of making useful changes to the code"".)<p>First, observe that most software projects are developed over an extended period and evolve over time. As a basic approximation, assume 75% of development time on such projects is spent performing maintenance on existing code. Assume also that half of that maintenance time is spent understanding that existing code.<p>Now, even if the code <i>today</i> has positive attributes such as correctness and good performance, those properties will only be sustained if the code's maintainability is good, because code is typically changed several times after it is originally written and if it is too difficult to make useful changes during maintenance then quality and efficiency will be reduced. Moreover, given the proportion of maintenance time spent on program comprehension, good readability is a necessary (though not necessarily sufficient) condition for good maintainability.<p>Thus, readability is paramount, because without it you can't have good maintainability, and without that you won't sustain any other desirable properties in the long term even if your code has them today.<p>The exception is when future maintenance of the code is low priority or irrelevant, for example if you're about to ship something that can't easily be changed once it's out the door, at which point obviously you care greatly about things like correctness and performance today.<p>The above argument doesn't say anything about whether ""superficial beauty"" actually affects readability as I have defined it. However, it would not be unreasonable to guess that it does, given that good visual design and typography have been shown to affect comprehension and reading speed under many different conditions. While I know of no research addressing the general influence of cosmetic presentation on bug count, there has certainly been research done into more specific questions. For example, in one study, using indents of 2-4 spaces measurably improved program comprehension relative to using either no indentation or indenting by 6 spaces (even though subjectively some programmers preferred the larger indent).<p>I haven't tried to present this as a rigorous argument with sources because I'm not sure the detailed statistics really affect the general gist of what I'm saying anyway, but FWIW all of the assumptions and figures I've chosen are based on extensive personal study of resarch literature, so they're definitely a reasonable starting point.",1326583341

See <a href=""http://www.employmentlawgroup.net/Articles/ROswald/DefendingNonCompete.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.employmentlawgroup.net/Articles/ROswald/Defending...</a> : ""Before signing a non-compete agreement, an employee should request that the employer include a garden-leave provision in the non-compete. A garden- leave clause requires the employer to continue paying the former employee her salary and benefits in exchange for the employees agreement not to compete with the employer. This arrangement benefits both the employer and the employee because it gives employers necessary protection against unfair competition yet  ensures that employees are financially secure during the non-compete period. While Virginia courts have not yet addressed the enforceability of a garden-leave provision, other courts have held that a former employee is entitled to garden-leave pay where she is unable to find new employment because of a non-compete.""<p>The Wikipedia entry on non-competes may be helpful: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-compete_clause"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-compete_clause</a>",1326582396

And indeed, it's usually counterproductive - that's why any experienced JavaScript dev will have coding conventions like ""Don't muck with the prototypes of built-in objects.""<p>But at the application layer, this can be really useful.  Imagine you're adding a new field to a message deep in the storage system, and then you want to pass that along to a template in the rendered HTML.  It's <i>really</i> useful to be able to do this without recompiling & restarting each individual server between the backend and the frontend, and just edit a few template files and have them automatically pick up any changes to backend data formats.<p>Ditto adding a new database column, if you're using an RDBMS - it's pretty handy to have your model objects instantly reflect the new field, instead of needing to manually add accessors to each of your model classes.  Rails and Django are built on this principle.<p>Also, you have a versioning problem with statically-compiled code in a distributed system.  Imagine that you add this new 'lenght' field to a backend message, and add it to the frontend, and they both compile & deploy.  Now imagine that a message from an old backend hits a new frontend (it's not possible to upgrade a whole distributed system at once without downtime).  What does the new frontend do with it?  It needs a piece of data, but the backend had no idea that it had to provide that piece of data.  The only thing it <i>can</i> do is return the equivalent of 'undefined'.<p>In C++/Java code, you usually deal with these by inventing frameworks.  Google code, for example, is littered with<p><pre><code>  if (msg.has_new_field()) {\n    run_long_complicated_ui_display_routine(msg.new_field());\n  } else {\n    fall_back_to_old_behavior(msg.old_field());\n  }\n</code></pre>\nchecks.  If you use a more dynamic language like Python, you can use language mechanisms to represent undefined values or fields that are defined at runtime.  If you use a static language, you're stuck mimicking them with hashmaps and null.",1326582089

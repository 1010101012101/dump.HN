7774075,comment,7762979,7772985,1,0,graycat,,,"> No need to guess whether the underlying assumptions of the model are true, just see if it works.<p>No, there are assumptions also for this approach, and these assumptions also need to be checked.<p>Then in applying the model that has been checked, there are still more assumptions, that need to be checked.<p>And checking models is often essentially hypothesis testing where need more assumptions and, commonly, some experience to know what hypothesis tests to use.  E.g., tests in regression can be F ratios and/or t-tests, and need to check some assumptions or at least robustness here.<p>E.g., in power spectral estimation, see, Blackman and Tukey, &#x27;The Measurement of Power Spectra&#x27;, there is a severe trade off between resolution and stability, another case of a trade off between bias and variance.  Tough to &#x27;automate&#x27; that consideration.<p>So, take a box of data.  Divide it in half.  Use the first half for the &#x27;fitting&#x27; or &#x27;training&#x27; data.  Test on the second half.  Not deep; I advised some people in finance to do that in about 1982; not nearly new; and I very much doubt I was the first; gotta believe that J. Tukey, L. Breiman, and others thought of this long before I did.<p>And if the test fails, then try to fit again.  Run all night and in the morning, presto, have a model that does well on the test data.  Now what have we?  Not a trivial question to answer.<p>Why least squares instead of something else?  A good answer is not easy.<p>I&#x27;m not criticizing biology, and it&#x27;s done some excellent science, e.g., see the E. Lander lectures in his MIT course in biology.<p>Statistics is a good field with a lot of good work by a lot of bright people with excellent backgrounds in pure and applied math.<p>The first time I heard about &#x27;machine learning&#x27; I guessed they meant filling in the optimal value function for stochastic dynamic programming.  Okay, that is a kind of &#x27;learning&#x27;.  But, that&#x27;s not what they had in mind.<p>Next an example was the children&#x27;s interactive computer game Animals where a child thinks of an animal, answers some questions about the animal to chase down a binary tree, stored in the program, to a leaf, and have the computer guess the animal.  If the computer is wrong it asks the child &quot;What is true for your animal and false for my guess.&quot;, adds to the binary tree, and thus, &#x27;learns&#x27;.  Call it a parlor trick.<p>A little like &#x27;self driving cars&#x27;:  Really &#x27;self-driving&#x27;?  Nope, not close.  Only on streets where everything has been mapped down to 1 cm or better including all the painted lines, all the curbs, all the traffic signs, and all the traffic lights, etc.  In no way does the &#x27;self driving car&#x27; actually look at a new street scene, make sense out of it, and use that &#x27;learning&#x27; to drive.  Instead, so far a self driving car is about as amazing as a train on a track.<p>We&#x27;re talking hype, old wine, filtered, in new bottles, and not much that is new and good.  Or, the old academic joke goes, &quot;the new is not good and the good, not new.&quot;.  The last time I looked at a leading &#x27;machine learning&#x27; prof, I had conclude that he needed to return to ugrad school, be a math major, and learn how to read/write math.<p>E.g., why maximum likelihood estimation?  There are reasons, but I saw no hint of them in the Ng lectures at Stanford.<p>We&#x27;ve known a lot about pure and applied statistics and how to use them for a very long time.  The good work in statistics is high quality pure/applied math, e.g., Billingsly, &#x27;Convergence of Probability Measures&#x27;, e.g. with Ulam&#x27;s result Le Cam called &#x27;tightness&#x27;, Brillinger on time series, Serfling on limit theorems, Rao on linear methods, Breiman on CART, and much more.  I&#x27;m not seeing comparable quality in &#x27;machine learning&#x27;; indeed, from all I&#x27;ve seen only a tiny fraction of the computer science machine learning people have the math prerequisites for good research in statistics.<p>Yes, I&#x27;ve published peer-reviewed original research in statistics, indeed, applied to a problem in computer science.",1400608724

They aren&#x27;t used for final rankings as the simulation results need to be validated. However, they provide a nice way for people to gauge their standing.<p>To perform the final ranking/validation, we&#x27;ll play n of the top games on each team against each other and then sort by wins and losses. We&#x27;re not quite sure of how large n will be, but I think it will be 150-250.  It would be nice to calculate the public leaderboards this way, but as a O(n*m) calculation, it really doesn&#x27;t scale in practice (we have to strike a balance between accuracy and responsiveness of the ranking system). The public leaderboards are calculated with a Bayesian algorithm.<p>If you have any other questions, feel free to ask! :)",1400608711

E.g. Netflix <-> Level 3 <-> Comcast <-> a Netflix subscriber.<p>Netflix and the Netflix subscriber are each paying their ISPs hefty sums for access to &quot;the Internet&quot;.  In the ideal world, Level 3 and Comcast would peer at various points for maximum efficiency on both their networks.<p>Comcast enjoys a local municipality government monopoly in their markets, with iffy competition from state and Federal monopolies granted to the RBOCs Verizon, AT&T, and in theory CenturyLink (which owns the US West states, but has never been very serious about Internet service and especially their own &quot;TV&quot;/cable service), and all the small ILECs who provide telephone service where the big boys had no interest.<p>One big problem here is that &quot;TV&quot;/cable service deployment for the first two RBOCs, who cover the vast majority of the population, has been halted outside of contractual requirements with municipalities and the like.  (If you&#x27;re in a really bad spot, like I am, on unincorporated land adjacent to two cities, the local cable company is not required to provide service and doesn&#x27;t, AT&T provides slow and expensive (but reliable!) ADSL with very small caps, 150 GiB per month ... and now they&#x27;re buying the DirectTV my parents use to get around that cable company problem!)<p>So as noted in the article, the bandwidth flow might be asymmetrical, and for these local &quot;last mile&quot; ISPs, there are technical and economic reasons for only providing asymmetrical service in the first place, e.g. head end noise, but all the Netflix bits coming in through Level 3 to Comcast Netflix subscribers are paid for, by the hefty payments the subscribers pay to Comcast for access to &quot;the Internet&quot;.  (And which are soon going to get caps as well from what I&#x27;ve read.)<p>But Comcast would of course prefer you get your &quot;TV&quot;/cable bits from <i>them</i>, and have no particular interest in enabling Netflix to supplant them.

This is naturally occurring, because each piece of glue is not used many times, and its task isn&#x27;t all that easy to define.<p>So, taking this to Microservices: while we can build a bunch of little services that will be reused everywhere. The large majority of a system will be this kind of glue: You can&#x27;t make every single piece of code you write be as well defined as grep, but with a service interface.

7773707,comment,7773253,7773253,2,0,devnonymous,,,"Awesome ! Two points I&#x27;d like to make:<p>a. This idea, of using QR code to capture debug info, by itself is very interesting and innovative (AFAIK). Does there exist user space applications (desktop/web/mobile ...) that do similar things ? (ie: don&#x27;t send us the logs, just click a pic and attach it to your support ticket ...). I personally haven&#x27;t come across any, but of course my knowledge is limited. In any case, I think this sort of log capturing for debug purposes certainly should&#x27;ve be done more, IMHO.<p>b. Something like this could have never come out of proprietary software, simply because this is someone developer&#x27;s specific itch that needed to be scratched. Whenever they say that open source software cannot compete with proprietary software, because proper &#x27;product management&#x27; doesn&#x27;t exist which guides feature development or that proprietary software will do the &#x27;hard&#x27; things that aren&#x27;t interesting/fun or just too much effort, I always argue against that.

7773700,comment,7773256,7773256,1,0,nickalewis,,,"I&#x27;ve recently developed a renewed interest in iOS development particularly because of ReactiveCocoa.  The idea of declaratively describing the intent of an action, rather than how it should work, has helped things &quot;click&quot; for me and I&#x27;m looking forward to using FRP and ReactiveCocoa in building a few personal iOS projects. I&#x27;m continuing to read more about it and this post was very helpful, thanks for sharing.  I have a couple additional questions for any seasoned iOS / ReactiveCocoa / FRP devs that would definitely help me along as I progress:<p>1) Are there any performance gotchas or things to look out for  when embracing ReactiveCocoa?  One thing thats stuck with me as I read is making sure to understand and keep and eye on memory management, even after embracing ARC.  Is debugging ReactiveCocoa code any different than the normal imperative way?<p>2) What parts of an app shouldn&#x27;t be handled with FRP? Should everything fit into the framework or is a code smell to handle things both ways?<p>3) I&#x27;m a Ruby Dev and I&#x27;m looking hard at RubyMotion as a good toolchain for iOS Dev. It looks like ReactiveCocoa and Rubymotion can play well together[1], but is this a hack? Is there any issue with using Rubymotion and ReactiveCocoa together. Seems like a great fit, but perhaps my inexperience isn&#x27;t aware of a deeper issue.<p>[1] <a href=""http://spin.atomicobject.com/2013/06/18/reactivecocoa-rubymotion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spin.atomicobject.com/2013/06/18/reactivecocoa-rubymo...</a>",1400605479

Experienced pilots come primarily from the US military. For a civilian trying to get into that market you are essentially a liability the first five years of flying.  Military guys come out with 8-20 years experience... And thousands of hours, And Uncle Sam paid all their practice time. As a civilian you are only worth $16k per year because that&#x27;s what the military pays junior flyers. (Which sucks because jet instruction is hundreds of dollars per practice hour to fly the smallest little Lear, easily $20k out of pocket)  There are are only a fixed number of jets in commercial service.. There are far more entry level pilots than available jobs, several times over.<p>At the Top end, the number of qualified pilots thins out dramatically... It takes thousands of flight hours and hundreds of instruction hours. So those pilots are worth $300k... Probably more except a fair number of them would be living off Military retirements.. Which forces wages below the actual cost of acquiring the skills.<p>Commercial piloting is an MLM scheme... Lots of people are willing to work for crap wages just to get wings and a shot at the bigger planes you can ONLY get from airlines. There is zero leverage for new employees.<p>Also, if airline are only paying pilots 5% of operating expenses, then pilot wages were NEVER the problem... They&#x27;re just easy to blame. If you are running a business so close to the red you cannot have 5% wiggle room your business model has far bigger problems than Unions wanting slightly better wages.

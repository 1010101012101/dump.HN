There are plenty of pens with internal reservoirs on the market, whether ball, fountain or fibre, I've been using one of these[1] almost continuously for the past 6-7 years.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/stainless-fountain-cartridges-convertible-bottled/dp/B000JTPEAS/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/stainless-fountain-cartridges-conver...</a>",1215341959

Make grandparents happy, that makes +1+1 days. Each of you can take 2 days off a month. And this is even without parental leave for three years.<p>After that, daycare is your answer: socializing is an essential need for humans.",1215341480

This is fundamentally at odds with the execution model defined by the JVM.""<p>So it is (obviously) not really that useful an idea, other then perhaps as a curious or academic excercise (not terribly practical).",1215340610

237750,comment,236853,237184,0,0,Create,,,"Society has a response to (a) and (b). It is called a social net, based on solidarity: it works like insurance schemes should (not speaking of fraudulent market schemes, e.g. the US health insurance).\nI think the biggest problem is, that you despise pooling resources into social systems purportedly designed to help in (a) and (b). ""Old"" Europe has suffered enough in WWII to recognize the importance of it, and erect such a system, which is frowned upon by ""risk tolerant entrepreneurship"" (they have enough personal wealth to fall back on). This social net you are missing is being therefore dismantled in the EU as well, since it is regarded as uncompetitive compared to the US or China. It is a race to the bottom (if you compete with slaves, you become a slave*), of which the GOOG kindergarten is just a sign.<p><a href=""http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener</a>",1215339946

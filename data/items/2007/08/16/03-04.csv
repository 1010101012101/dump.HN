Also, when you have a number of balkanized sub-groups at a site who like different things, about the only content they can all agree on as 'great' is LOLcats and anti-Republican propaganda.  These problems can be solved...  at least if enough venture capital is thrown at the problem.",1187236459
42904,comment,42587,42587,0,0,henning,,,"Slightly OT: those who enjoyed Norvig's PAIP but wanted more AI content will enjoy Forbus and de Kleer's Building Problem Solvers. Starts out on the same subject matter as PAIP but spends a lot of time talking about truth maintenance system.<p>The code is in Common Lisp.<p>It's old-style symbolic AI which is fairly limited in its utility, but truth maintenance systems have interesting applications in natural language processing and and other domains, so, whatever.",1187235845

I think the arrangement where the founders are not currently developers would be equally effective as a team of developers as long as they are able to accurately capture and understand their customer's needs prior to the start of coding. ...""</i><p>I wish all or some customer needs could be fixed at the start of coding but it's not likely to happen. For a start, exactly ""who is a startups customers?"" You can ask them, but you need a demo first. If you build <i>new products</i> (stuff that by definition has not been built before) a constant dialog with users is required <i>'at'</i> the time of coding and development not before.<p><i>""... If I'd asked people what they wanted, they would have asked for a better horse. ...""</i> ~ <a href=""http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Henry_Ford"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Henry_Ford</a><p>There is one other problem I can think of. Sometimes the customer is not in the position to know what is possible. So it's up to the developer(s) to build something not specified directly by customers.  Zenter is an example. In a talk with Crosby & Walker (<a href=""http://www.grid7.com/podpress_trac/feed/178/0/vCast070807_Zenter.mp3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grid7.com/podpress_trac/feed/178/0/vCast070807_Ze...</a>  Podcast #24 - Founders of Zenter, 46Mb ) it becomes apparent that in developing Zenter it was not merely just a copy of MS Powerpoint. It required knowledge of what existing users require. Then extend it to the Web. Exploiting the Webs unique properties.<p>The gap of knowing what customers need (upfront or close to upfront) and taking a guess where users need now and in the future is what makes startups ""late binding"" in needs requirements.",1187235267

If you want to do it, go ahead, but first let me know what you think.<p>I'm sure everyone has heard of this, and I'm pretty sure this has already been thought of (what hasn't, right?) but I haven't seen it in my feed pop up in the myriad facebook apps my friends have added. The pitch: facebook app/six degrees of separation game (find out how many steps to a random person (if possible)). Just had this idea like two minutes ago. Any thoughts??",1187233587
42890,comment,42702,42856,0,0,mangodrunk,,,"I'm curious to know why you think <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> is ""the most important work of modern fiction"". Rand's ideas weren't original and if someone needed to read her book to emulate Hank Rearden they will never be like Hank.  <p>At the time that I read it I thought it was the greatest fiction book I've ever read but that's because I'm technical and don't care much for <i>good literature</i>. But after time it has faded and I noticed her philosphy was nothing new. Maybe if she wrote it before the 16th Century I would say it was great but the 1950s?  <p>I still agree with most of her writings, but they are irrelevant. I thought those things before I read the book and so did the philosophers before her.",1187233297

Before I took the job I applied to YC with an idea for a tool that would make administering and refactoring databases less painful, but was rejected, probably because my cofounder was still in college and intended to go back after the summer.  The idea has since morphed into a web-based RDBMS designed to run on AWS.<p>Although I like the people I'm working with and think the company has a decent chance, ASP is rotting my brain.  I'd be much happier working on the database startup if I could find a new co-founder and seed funding.  I'm not planning on applying to this YC funding round since I'd rather wait six months for the next one and stay in Boston, but anyone interested in applying with me could persuade me otherwise.",1187233284

Even I have experienced harassment and abuse myself. This may be common in the tech industry but it is not OK.</i><p>I find it hard to imagine other professionals (doctors, lawyers, accountants, even other engineering disciplines) behaving like this.<p>Is that a failure of imagination on my part or is IT/CS particularly toxic?",1434668394
9742095,comment,9741625,9741838,0,0,deet,,,"This project specifically is probably not useful for others just because it is written in another language (unless it were to succeed in fixing problems or improving security or performance.) Redis is a server application, not a library, so there&#x27;s a clearly defined and interoperable protocol to bridge the Redis server to other languages already. Writing a Redis client for the other language would be more useful.<p>More generally, as coldtea mentions, making integration into the rest of the language&#x27;s ecosystem is the primary benefit of rewriting in another language.<p>The value of such a port to others depends on how easy it is to integrate between the two languages, either via libraries or other methods. The harder it is to integrate the two (and the absence of automated translation tools) increases the value of the rewrite to others.<p>Your Core-NLP example is actually an interesting one, because that library has already been ported to other languages...

The purpose of which was to develop the opportunistic spectrum use capability described in the article. Early on, they saddled us with the requirement of implementing our technology as an SCA component, even in simulation. I glued some open source reference implementation together with our code, but we ended up hiring a consultant to write a whole SCA implementation in house. Which we then ended up throwing away because it was pointless to do that in a technology development platform.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t think CORBA is the worst thing ever. It was slow as shit back for the day, but in this age of HTTP based RPC services it seems lightweight and efficient. Memory management in the C++ binding was broken by design, however.",1434668309

It does take some mental effort to cruise through a prolonged fast. It&#x27;s especially hard in our society where so much is centered around food. It was inconvenient at times to be the one who doesn&#x27;t eat in social functions and such, but you get over it. The key is not to talk about it and have to explain to people why you&#x27;re not picking up a beer at the BBQ.

That would be hopelessly wasteful. But suppose we did one launch, sent one ship towards the moon, and then have it release 50 probes as it got close, each with a small amount of propellant sufficient get itself into orbit.<p>I am <i>not</i> suggesting a common design that is adequate to handle all the different conditions of the different missions you mention. I said specifically that we should focus some effort on developing cheap probes, accepting that they will be suboptimal in almost every case.<p>Let&#x27;s consider one of the most basic things we like to do, which is to simply take pictures of things. Pictures help sell science to the public because most people are interested in how things look, and they are scientifically useful. When we aggregate multiple pictures of the same subject we often get even more useful scientific data. Downsides, the data transmission requirements are large and visual spectrum is just a small slice of the information we&#x27;d like to collect. Upsides, you can buy a COTS camera that takes 4k video or ~50mp stills for a few thousand $. Likewise you can buy a fast lens of high optical quality very cheaply, and record onto very cheap solid-state media. Let&#x27;s accept that it will fail in some situations and that we don&#x27;t expect it to keep working for ever, but we would like it to work for a while. so we need some power (onboard or renewable or some combination of the two), an antenna of some sort to transmit the data back and listen to requests from our end, some shielding to protect it against the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, some sort of propulsion to get it into position and point it roughly where we want it to look, and a little control system to run it all.<p>Technologically this is no longer a tall order. We can stick a consumer video camera & phone in a lunchbox, attach it to a balloon, send it up to the stratosphere, and retrieve it afterwards for only hundreds of dollars, it&#x27;s a middle-school project by now. I think that we could make a pretty decent camera probe that would take relatively high resolution pictures at a relatively low frame rate and last for at least a year for a marginal cost of $100,000, maybe quite a bit less. 50 of those would be $5 million, which is the sort of sum you can raise on Kickstarter. Now, the fixed costs of launch, building a deployment module and numerous other things would be a lot higher, let&#x27;s say they started at $50 million. Well, that&#x27;s quite a lot of money but you could still raise it pretty easily. Donald Trump plans to waste twice that amount on promoting himself as a public figure while pretending he wants to be President, a summer blockbuster movie has launch costs of about $200m including marketing. There are lots of people in Silicon Valley who could write checks for that whole amount if they really wanted to. I pick $50 million as a benchmark because India managed to get a probe going around Mars for ~$75 million, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a totally outrageous idea to think we could deploy a bunch of lunar microsatellites for 2/3 of that.<p>OK, let&#x27;s say we even went overbudget by a factor 2 but we managed to do it. We have 50 probes in lunar orbit sending back, i dunno, 43 4k photographs of the lunar surface at the rate of 1 frame/minute (7 of them failed to deploy properly). None of them works properly for longer than 18 months. Within a few years they have all fallen out of orbit and are space junk on the lunar surface. Well, I think that we&#x27;d get a <i>ton</i> of useful knowledge from doing that.",1434666776

During the meeting with the founder we exchanged some background information and I was shown some info on the company&#x27;s performance thus far; this was huge personally as transparency had become a huge pain point with my previous employer.

It took me about 12 hours over the course of a week (evenings mostly - I was employed during this interview) to complete.

A lot of people don&#x27;t care at all, but among those who care a bit, it&#x27;s not comparable to, say, the 8th of May where most people more or less agree that the &quot;good&quot; won. Very few people in France will have the opinion that the good won at Waterloo.<p>I mean even when admitting Napoleon&#x27;s numerous bad aspects, the Coalition was hardly more legitimate that the Empire, so from this point of view commemorating Waterloo feels more like pure military brag and less like celebrating something actually good, thus reinforcing the feeling of righteousness on the losing side.<p>It sure feels much less important than de Gaulle&#x27;s Appeal of 18 June.",1434666311

9741965,comment,9731963,9738930,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"Today, in the US, employee exploitation is nonexistent.  It&#x27;s that simple.<p>We are very connected now.  How long would a company last today if they exploited their employees?  Not long at all.  They&#x27;d have trouble recruiting for sure.  It&#x27;d be all over the web.<p>Social forces are far more powerful than any legislation.<p>The extreme case being murder.<p>Is it illegal to kill?  Yes.<p>Do you go to prison for a long, long time?  Yes.<p>Are there laws covering this from all angles?  Yes.<p>Does government enforce them?  Yes.<p>Do people still commit murder?  Yup.<p>And here&#x27;s the most important question:<p>Is the main reason for which people DO NOT commit murder the fact that there are laws prohibiting it (or laying out severe consequences IANAL)?<p>Nope.<p>I would be very surprised if any murder had been prevented as a result of someone intellectually reaching the conclusion that the consequences would be severe.<p>Yes, this is an extreme case.  It simply illustrates the fact that laws don&#x27;t prevent behavior.  They punish it after the fact.<p>Do you speed on the highway?  Why?  The law says you are not allowed to.  Why do you do it?<p>If you come right down to it laws and rules don&#x27;t really do very well in the protection department.  Look at the commandments and rules of behavior of the various religions.  If you are a believer there is no higher power and yet they are broken all the time.<p>Laws don&#x27;t protect anyone, they punish after the fact.  Decent, moral and ethical people protect and enhance society.<p>Making the assumption that workers are protected by laws alone simply isn&#x27;t sensible.  Yet, nobody is proposing an environment devoid of any regulation.  That&#x27;s silly.  The only idea here is that regulation needs to be sensible.  That&#x27;s all.<p>We all know people who are absolutely miserable at work.  They have all the protections afforded to them through labor law and they are still miserable.  And they don&#x27;t leave.  They stay.  I&#x27;ve seen it multiple times.  They are free to do as they wish and do nothing.  Is the employer to blame?  Of course not.  And government can do nothing to make the employee happy.<p>I probably couldn&#x27;t list everything that has changed in the last 100 years in the US in this regard.  However, it is clear that exploitation is pretty much gone.  I&#x27;d challenge anyone to name a reputable company that is actively engaged in exploiting it&#x27;s employees in the US today.<p>I am sure someone is going to bring up some sleazy sweat shops in the garment district. Even there the employees have the ability to get the heck out and find work elsewhere.  They can&#x27;t, you say? They are undocumented immigrants?  Well, that&#x27;s not a labor law problem, is it then?  That&#x27;s an immigration problem.  If people were not able to work without proof of citizenship or legal work status the sweat shops would not be able to enslave poor immigrants.<p>Yet you don&#x27;t see those laws being passed, do you?  Why?  Almost anyone would agree it would be sensible.  Why don&#x27;t politicians pass these laws?  Simple.  They need the votes of those who want to see their relatives able to enter the US illegally.  Here&#x27;s a case of politicians hiding behind a &quot;cause&quot; for political gain while doing major damage to the very people they are supposed to want to help.  They don&#x27;t care about those poor immigrants that end-up working in sweat shops.  They could not care less.  They have their votes.  Maim and move on.<p>So, on the one hand we have the government messing with Uber on the technicality of whether someone is a contractor or employee (which they should have zero involvement in) while, on the other hand, we have government utterly ignoring the situation of illegal immigration leading to exploitation due to the lack of job mobility.  And, BTW, it is often culturally isolated immigrants who exploit other immigrants.  Anyone who has assimilated into our culture, morals, ethics and social conventions would not do that unless they were criminals.<p>Ironically the lack of job mobility of illegal immigrants actually proves the value of a free market.  They, through the failure of our government to address the issue, live within a framework that prevents them from participating in the free market for jobs.  They are devoid of the job mobility enjoyed by legal workers (citizens or not).  People in the free market can leave bad job situations or not take the job in the first place based on company reputation, yet the unfortunate situation of the illegal immigrants is that our government, through inaction, pretty much sets them up for abuse.<p>Interesting the twists and turns things can take when you look at them from multiple angles.",1434666083

But then someone point out to me[1] that I was running tests in a machine with two cores, and this actually may be better for machines with multiple cores[2].

Node was fantastic for this use case (and I replicated this model afterwards for a largish gambling site I contracted on): listening for connections, keeping them open, manage their relatively minimal state, and buffer relatively small streams. At no point in the app is there more than one stream per connection in the air. Backend requests are issued quickly and return quickly.<p>This works so well because the actual backend processing is a separate construct. Even though websocket connections can and do stay open for days, they don&#x27;t drain a lot of resources (except for a small amount of memory for state and data buffers). No part of the service - except for the dead-simple broker core - will ever be in a contentious state or stranded midway through an action waiting on an unreliable communication partner.<p>Howeve, this isn&#x27;t always feasible. My second example is a Node.js project I consulted on for a bigger company. The architecture was quite different: there were the same client-facing persistent connections to manage, but on top of that the backend logic was so immensely stateful and data-laden that a large chunk of it was actually implemented right in node. This meant, because streams and callbacks seem so misleadingly elegant sometimes, that situations occurred where lots of file streams, database connections, and all sorts of backend systems had to be kept in lock-step with the frontend-facing Node.js client connections.<p>It&#x27;s no surprise this construct choked, a lot. Some of these are actual hard choices, for example where large and long-running data streams are concerned, but in the end we managed to make the entire thing stable by decoupling client-facing mechanisms from backend resources, and yes: by putting some blunt restrictions in place.<p>Like with any technology, you need to be aware of the tradeoffs.",1434665231

I&#x27;ve worked with Postgres, MySQL and Oracle, and found that it is important to have a good understanding of the possible execution plans for a query. I will sometimes construct a query very carefully to achieve a particular plan. And when things go wrong, I run EXPLAIN PLAN, examine statistics, etc., and tweak my query to do what I want. You really have to do that to obtain good performance in some cases. It does undercut the claim that SQL has to being non-procedural, but that&#x27;s life.<p>I do NOT want to have to construct the query execution plan manually for every single query. Usually, the optimizer will do a fine job, assuming the database designer has made good choices regarding indexes and other physical design issues. But there are always a few complex, tricky queries where you do have to understand internals. The &quot;cognitive load&quot; is the same, and having a high-level query language means that when you do make your subtle and deft change to rescue performance, you often just tweak a query, instead of rewriting a detailed query plan.<p>(Extending this position a little: I have come around 180 degrees and consider ORMs to be a bad idea overall. When you do need to be very careful about writing a query, the ORM adds a layer of complexity -- not only do you need to control the SQL, but you now need to ensure that your ORM can produce that SQL.)",1434664893

With traditional SQL (e.g. Oracle, MSSQL, etc), the query rewriting engines are very mature and can be more aggressive and thereby fulfilling the goal of a declarative mathematical purity.

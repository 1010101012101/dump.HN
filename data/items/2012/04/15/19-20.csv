A bit disappointed, but not surprised.<p>Have a look at the original OAuth specification sometime.  Note how they misuse the word ""key"" to mean ""identifier"".  I can't imagine that anyone writing a crypto specification wouldn't know that this would be confusing; I think it's more likely that the person just didn't care.

First, what are the technical co-founders getting out of it if the risk fails? Next, how exactly are you, the non-technical entrepreneur, going to pull your weight? The scary thing about startup weekends are how many idea people walk around looking for others to build their product. I'm a designer and even I got stalked.<p>So I've decided to try and hack together whatever I can, just to show my potential future technical co-founder that I'm willing to do the dirty work and pull my weight. Do whatever you can, use wordpress temporarily, get started by outsourcing the work, set up a landing page with email signups. Show your co-founder that you've taken significant steps, minimize their risk, prove your product or service has traction, and already start heading towards some kind of success. Make it so that your co-founder doesn't have to build everything from scratch.<p>A product/service is what makes a company. Asking a programmer to make your product is basically asking them to build the foundation of your company for you. And no one is going to do that.",1334519688

Now, I'm as allergic to the usual MBA-seeking-coder-monkey as any technical guy, but Jamie had a few qualities that really pulled me in:<p>* Jamie came well-referred by technical people I trusted.  That introduction makes a huge difference (being approached by a random ""biz guy"" cold is almost always a non-starter for me.)<p>* She produces -- objectively.  Jamie got the initial version of the product built, brings in crazy amounts of press, and has don a ton of work to seed our marketplace.  Oh...and she also writes HTML and CSS.  I'm amazed by what she's been able to accomplish.<p>* During the ""founder dating"" phase, she never made me feel unequal.  Too many business people do things (inadvertently or otherwise) that make potential technical co-founders feel like the unwanted, silent partner who is little more than an equity drain on a world-changing business idea.  Jamie was looking for a business partner, not a coder.<p>The bottom line is that finding a technical co-founder is hard, but not impossible.  You have <i>no idea</i> how many smart coders I know who would theoretically love to do a startup, but ""don't have an idea"", or are hesitant to take risks, or have some other form of inertia that's keeping them in a boring day job.

The idea was that JavaScript was not going to be some language people wrote hundreds of thousands of lines of code in, and that the target audience would become frustrated if the language didn't ""help"" them.

Because that's not good, if you need an understanding of 100% of Foo to learn Bar, which incorporates Foo... this isn't to say that you shouldn't start teaching Bar in order to motivate students to go back and finish learning Foo, just that a % is a measure lacking in meaning.<p>I think a better way to gague knowledge is the A/C/F system a lot of my professors used in advanced math courses at Rutgers. An 'A' means you have a solid understanding of the material, a 'C' means you don't really understand it, but have a good enough grasp that you can move on and back-track to finish learning it as necessary. 'F' means you don't understand it well enough to move on, and should retake the course.<p>This requires a lot more thought on the side of the professor, but the motivation for students becomes a lot more clear: understand the material, and move on.",1234364122

477015,comment,476536,476841,0,0,DLWormwood,,,"I know you're being flippant, but there really is a critical underlying problem with making everyday technology intentionally arcane.<p>If people are unable to easily learn how something works, they will, for all intents and purposes, treat things as black boxes or ""magic"" and learn to distrust them (and those who do understand them) when things go wrong.  This problem isn't unique to computing.  My father grew up in an era where automobiles could still be serviced by end users, and learned to appreciate doing things like changing the oil or replacing parts himself.  As such, he knew the limitations of the machine and could be more helpful to mechanics when bringing in a vehicle that was too broken for him to fix.  Even more importantly, he knew when a mechanic was trying to snowball him with bogus repair suggestions.<p>The distance most people have from our food production processes is another example.  A century ago, vegetarianism, when it was rarely practiced, was usually a religious choice and not regarded as a threat by meat eaters, or vice versa.  Nowadays, its a full blown political movement which I suspect is in no small part due to the shock some people have growing up when they first learn where meat comes from late in their life (and in conditions most people feel have to be hidden.)  I've seen kids who vehemently deny that meat comes from animals.  When they grow older and finally learn/accept the truth, the impact would be much more shocking that a child who sees farm animals from a very young age.<p>Back to the original topic, even if most end users don't bother to learn to program, the <i>perception</i> that it is easy to get into is very important, in that it insures that they might know somebody who does.<p>I wish I could write more, but the gist I'm trying to get at is very hard to put into simple words.  Hopefully, somebody else here will understand my underlying point and enunciate it better than I can.",1234362390

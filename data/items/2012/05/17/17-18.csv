I don't think they will make much of profit if are willing to share $ with photography owners. The majority of value in Pinterest's user experience is that its fresh and content is created (pinned) by other users, NOT by corporations. The moment you will see every other picture a picture of an Ikea Kettle (or desk, or anything else thats been uploaded as ""promoted pin"") that resembles in color, shape, etc to what you were looking for, entire experience will loose its cool and Pinterest will start to stink!<p>> Youtube: [...]<p>- this was a huge gamble from many perspectives and owners had amazing amount of luck. Due to copyright issues, some board members were pressed very hard to vote with for a buy, but were strongly against (sorry I cannot back this up, but I read it somewhere couple years ago). Further, Viacom shoot itself in the foot by uploading their own material, but during discovery it clearly came up that owners knew about copyright infringement (duh!) and were willing to ""slow down"" with taking content down to gain more attraction. Clearly, in # of users AND eventual exit, they benefit in huge way off of Viacom content. Again, they were extremely lucky and in the light of recent Kim DotCom case, even more lucky Mashable is not interviewing them in a jail cell. But AFAIK some court cases Goog vs Viacom are still pending. As of whether it will turn out to be a huge success, I think we still need to wait. People are social today like never before. Instagram you mentioned was bought because FB was afraid of its growing userbase. As we both know, YouTube is only a little bit social -- not as social as comparing Instagram to Flickr, for example. If the userbase of the next thing (video) of sites like viddly will keep growing, and at some point owners will tell Google ""fuck off, we ain't selling!"", I say YouTube will be screwed. Also, if you look even further in the future, it obviously won't be as cool as today, or 3 years ago.

They both liberalized of credit and investing. Day trading and online brokers that emerged with the dotcom bubble helped fuel the investment that drove it. Subprime lending and the mad financial engineering that supported it made a home mortgage available to almost anyone. Both innovations facilitated a lot of shadiness.<p>The other morning I caught a segment on CNBC talking about some financial company that wanted to make startups more accessible to ordinary investors. That's already a reality to some extent, at the grassroots level, with kickstarter. These seem like the sort of innovations that would again liberate a lot investment and speculation.<p>They're sort of unrelated to the Groupon and Facebook IPOs -- those IPOs don't have anything to do with them. And yet at the same time they are trends that draw momentum from the buzz surrounding Groupon and Facebook.<p>I keep looking for the next bubble, more as a casual student of human nature than any sort of financial whiz.

IMHO the concerns expressed by some here about relying on Ruby are greatly exaggerated.<p>For anyone who is curious, the steps required to use SASS on Windows are something like:<p>1. Download RubyInstaller from rubyinstaller.org and run it. (This is a self-contained Windows installer for Ruby and the related tools/documentation.)<p>2. Run ""gem install sass"" at a command prompt. (This downloads and installs SASS itself, including SCSS.)<p>Personally, I'd love it if Ninite picked Ruby up as an option, because I already install many other tools that way in a single step. However, installing Ruby manually is no harder than installing any other piece of Windows software you download, and installing SASS on top is literally a one-liner.<p>Unless you're developing on a relatively old and low-powered system, I don't see any downside to having the extra software installed either: it's just another tool, occupying a few MB of hard drive and a few characters in your PATH, and IME it's perfectly friendly toward development toolchains for other languages.",1337275031

And taxing the rich to make investments that grow the middle class, is the single smartest thing we can do for the middle class, the poor and the rich.""<p>That is his ""exciting idea"" -- something that pretty much anyone who is interested in tax reform has heard before. There was nothing groundbreaking about it, no new information, and certainly no unique solution to the problem.

If it takes the same kind of expertise to do both, then spending more time on one means less on the other.<p>Still no idea if that's true of AI, but I found a couple of interesting cites:<p><i>Patrick Winston, director of MIT's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory from 1972 to 1997, echoed Minsky. ""Many people would protest the view that there's been no progress, but I don't think anyone would protest that there could have been more progress in the past 20 years. What went wrong went wrong in the '80s.""<p>Winston blamed the stagnation in part on the decline in funding after the end of the Cold War and on early attempts to commercialize AI. But the biggest culprit, he said, was the ""mechanistic balkanization"" of the field, with research focusing on ever-narrower specialties such as neural networks or genetic algorithms. ""When you dedicate your conferences to mechanisms, there's a tendency to not work on fundamental problems, but rather [just] those problems that the mechanisms can deal with,"" said Winston.</i><p><a href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/37525/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/37525/</a><p>They don't go into detail about how the early attempts to commercialize contributed to the problem. This site does, but seems less trustworthy:<p><i>In the early 1980s, dark clouds also settled over the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab as it split into factions by initial attempts to commercialize Artificial Intelligence (AI). In fact, some of MIT's best White Hats left the AI Lab for high-paying jobs at start-up companies.</i><p><a href=""http://computer.yourdictionary.com/golden-age-era"" rel=""nofollow"">http://computer.yourdictionary.com/golden-age-era</a><p>So it sounds like some smart people in academia in the 80s think that some stones were left unturned, or turned too slowly, and that part of the problem was a refocus on making money on existing discoveries.

There's certainly evidence that the very highest incomes have climbed substantially since, say, 1980, but can you find numbers that suggest that there are fewer households making at least middle class incomes? Here's a good bit from a guy at Brookings earlier this year:<p><a href=""http://www.nationalreview.com/agenda/288306/guest-post-scott-winship-obama-administrations-questionable-mobility-claims-reihan-sal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nationalreview.com/agenda/288306/guest-post-scott...</a><p><i>Kruegers claim of a shrinking middle class relies on the same peculiar definition. Specifically, middle class is defined as having a household income at least half of median income but no more than 1.5 times the median. I re-ran the numbers using the same definition and data source as Krueger and found that the entire reason the middle class has shrunk is that more households today have incomes that put them above middle class. Thats right, the share of households with income that puts them in the middle class or higher was 76 percent in 1970 and 75 percent in 2010two figures that are statistically indistinguishable.</i>",1337274360

7844650,comment,7842282,7843337,11,0,vidarh,,,"I agree. Going head on into sales makes all the difference.<p>My first company was an ISP that we started with a $40k seed investment, out of a basement. I literally sat down with the phone book and started phoning companies to people to host web sites with us. This was in &#x27;95, and many of the people I called did not even know what the internet was, much less had any idea of why they&#x27;d want a website, so it was a difficult proposition.<p>All I knew about sales, I knew from a one day course and two weeks experience doing calls for a charity.<p>My main takeaway from said charity, who had professionalized extracting money from people, was that if you worry about your product, you don&#x27;t understand; when you do cold calls, it&#x27;s 99% about emotion and gaining trust. They&#x27;d even diagrammed out how you wanted the person on the other end to feel at any stage of the call.<p>And it worked, scarily well. Despite the fact that I&#x27;m an introvert and was painfully shy and lacking in social skills. I <i>winced</i> before making every call. I&#x27;d sit there and have to breathe to calm myself before dialling even the first digit.<p>Way too often when people complain that their product isn&#x27;t ready to sell, it&#x27;s because they try to sell it on price and feature bullet lists without building any kind of rapport and trust first. That&#x27;s hard enough in person, when people have far more to judge you on.<p>But if you cold call, if the person on the other side does not trust you, you could not even get them to accept cash from you for free.<p>If you don&#x27;t get them excited about <i>you</i>, no feature list in the world is going to get them to buy it from you, because all their defences will be set to &quot;full nuclear deterrent&quot;.<p>But if you get them to trust you, they&#x27;ll often go out of their way to give you all the information you need to successfully sell it to them. Sometimes that mean you go away with a list of changes you need to make to your product because you genuinely wasn&#x27;t ready. But if you get people to be excited about you, sometimes you can even get them to pay for some of those changes as custom development.",1401872327

7844643,comment,7838450,7844451,1,0,glenra,,,"> <i>surely you don&#x27;t suggest we should allow majority of workers to be exploited because some weakly profitable restaurants might fail?</i><p>Who is exploiting whom here? Most restaurants fail. Nearly all restaurants lose money in the first three years of operation. During that time, when the firm is <i>losing</i> money but still paying salaries, isn&#x27;t the firm owner the one being <i>exploited</i>? And aren&#x27;t you exploiting the owner even <i>more</i> by forcing him or her to lose even <i>more</i> money on the way to a slim chance of profitability?<p>People who consider that &quot;the gains outweigh the losses&quot; probably don&#x27;t realize that even those who <i>get a raise</i> due to a minimum wage law might be on net worse off than before that law was passed. Certainly those who lose their job or fail to get a new one are worse off, but even some who <i>keep</i> their job are also worse off, because they lose other benefits in lieu of salary that they presumably valued <i>more</i>.<p>There is no plausible <i>theory</i> that says low-skill workers are made better off by making it illegal to hire them for less than a specified price. Legally fixing one term in a contract in general makes <i>both</i> parties to that sort of contract worse off. There are many reasons why it should be hard to <i>measure</i> the damage the minimum wage does so it&#x27;s not surprising that a few empirical studies return the &quot;man-bites-dog&quot; result, but we shouldn&#x27;t fool ourselves into thinking it doesn&#x27;t do any harm at all just because that harm is occasionally hard to measure.<p>The minimum wage is callous and cruel; it harms those least able to afford being harmed. It is at heart indefensible.<p>Fortunately, we live in a rich enough society that being legislatively forced into a suboptimal job situation or involuntary unemployment is usually recoverable. It&#x27;s not a death sentence. Yes, Seattle is effectively kicking poor people in the face with this law, but in the grand scheme of things it&#x27;s probably not the <i>worst</i> legislative indignity we inflict on them.",1401872149

I help companies defend themselves from lawsuits involving nonsense patents regarding the stuff that I happen to know a bit about. One thing that might be done to help concentrate the effort where it has the most effect is to find out about the actual lawsuits filed by the trolls and then to prioritize those.<p>It&#x27;s great to go after all patents filed by some troll, and that needs doing, but for the parties that are being sued by trolls specific action on specific patents would be far more beneficial.<p>Most of the patents litigated today were filed quite a while ago and if we don&#x27;t concentrate on finding the prior art that might help a party sued under those particular patents it might well get lost. So concentrate on the patents that are actively litigated first, then concentrate on the patents that can still be easily squashed and then work from the oldest to the newest.<p>I realize that&#x27;s a tall order but this is imo the best way to prioritize this kind of work. The main reason for the prioritization like this is that patents are filed in a system that does not forget, prior art is not filed in a central place and even stuff that happened less than two decades ago can be almost impossible to locate any proof of that will stand up in court. So older stuff should get priority.<p>Incidentally, Joao Controls is still on the warpath with their bogus live video patents.",1401871076

So for example, if you have a long program that you find a bug in then you take the node with the buggy code (usually a few lines, maybe 10&#x27;s of lines) and you &#x27;clone&#x27; that node to the spot where you have your bug report or list of tickets or whatever. You then describe the bug, the fix and modify the code (which will modify the original code as well), or you modify the original code leaving the clone as a &#x27;living pointer&#x27; to the code to document the location where the bug was found. You add the unit test as another node right where the bug report lives.<p>The &#x27;thin&#x27; model (where you import external files without actually having them present in your outline) is a variation on this theme, another way of doing it is to have the code present in the outline itself and then to export the code whenever the document gets saved.<p>Both methods have their pros and cons. The biggest con in my opinion is that leo use is not widespread enough that you can expect to collaborate with someone else like this. That means that if you post your project on github or if you share the code with a fellow coder that all that Leo mark-up is wasted.

You probably won&#x27;t, but I&#x27;m inclined to say it anyway :-)<p>First, to clear some things up, I&#x27;ll avoid conflating traditional enterprise servers and hosted servers with the on-demand, pay-as-you-use cloud model.  The later is what I mean by &quot;Cloud&quot;, not just hosted servers.<p>To my knowledge Red Hat only holds a lead in server OS installations with paid support, and that&#x27;s almost all in the former model (non-cloud, for me).  Incidentally that&#x27;s also the stat you&#x27;ll see when companies publish reports about Linux&#x27;s market share in general - they often just look at who&#x27;s <i>buying</i> Linux.  It&#x27;s hard to get a real picture of what people actually use when you include unpaid Linux usage (which is most Linux usage), but the best data I know of is created by scanning web hosts, and suggest that Linux server run in order Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS and RedHat:<p><a href=""http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/os-linux/all/all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/os-linux/all/all</a><p>Red Hat&#x27;s sudden obsession with OpenStack in the last 12 months, the move to take over CentOS and the purchase of InkTank are reflections that Red Hat are struggling to get in that game and are prepared to spend big to do so.<p>Why are they struggling so hard?  Because they&#x27;re frightened. The steady, &quot;we want everything to stay the same for 10 years&quot; model they&#x27;ve been serving so well is seriously threatened and they need to be in the new market to continue their success.  Businesses love the idea of the cloud (if not yet the reality).  Read what companies say about the cloud - they&#x27;ll talk about it in terms of flexibility, and opportunity, but what they really love is that it means that you can offload the genuinely generic work of IT infrastructure management. This reduces the reliance on staff and consultancy costs, which are the most expensive aspect of corporate IT (hint, want to stay employed, get with the program, fast!).  It also means that whether you&#x27;re using Red Hat or Ubuntu, you get to negotiate the fee for OS level support via a behemoth like HP, Amazon, Microsoft or Google, or if you&#x27;re a huge company with a private cloud, you centralise all that and do it in bulk.  The same goes for the physical space for hosting.<p>Now Amazon were an existing Red Hat customer and so their servers were already running that when they started on this public cloud adventure - which afterall was a clever way to reuse their existing investment in infrastructure and personnel outside peak load time. That&#x27;s not a big win for Red Hat, but there&#x27;s growth of their existing business for sure (who knows what kind of deal Amazon got from them?). Still, the utilisation of that cloud is the bigger chunk of new business there, and it&#x27;s Ubuntu winning the majority of it.<p>Now spread out to the nascent cloud market as a whole, sure Amazon are a huge public cloud with the bulk of utilisation, but there are many others, new ones all the time.  Additionally and many, many private clouds that are being created those are the opportunities for new revenue in the hosting market.  Almost all of them are going with OpenStack and 55% of OpenStack deployments are Ubuntu right now (I&#x27;ve seen Red Hat running at less than 1/10th of that business.  I&#x27;d expect Red Hat to increase that number a lot in the next couple of years (they&#x27;ll convert some existing customers for sure), but don&#x27;t be fooled by the recent, aggressive press releases from Red Hat - they&#x27;re fighting to get a foothold in this market, not controlling it by any means.",1401869934

We’ll build it for $500…. $100? OK, deal.” We learned a lot as we tried to abstract the sites we were building into something modular, and we got a lot of experience pitching and hearing “no.” One “no” that I still regret more than most of the others I have subsequently heard (for much bigger deals) was for this amazing Pakistani restaurant, Kabobeesh, that served a chicken kabob sandwich on fresh naan bread for $3.50: we tried to sell them a site for 100 chicken rolls, but failed to close them.</i><p>I love how much time was spent exploring the early grind phase of this journey.

My .leo files are what keeps me sane when I&#x27;m in the middle of a project with a few hundred documents and need to compile a report. I like it that it&#x27;s local instead of some online service (there are plenty of those, but I would feel remiss if I used them for something that is supposed to be confidential).<p>Leo is not very polished, it&#x27;s a programmers tool and I&#x27;m ok with that. I tried getting the hang of emacs &#x27;org&#x27; mode for a while but the learning curve was just too steep for me. I want my tools to get out of the way rather than that they dictate my whole workflow and Leo is light enough to do that. It&#x27;s written in Python, you can modifiy it fairly easily. There are some warts (for instance, the export tree to html function is next to useless) but on the whole I&#x27;m very grateful that it exists and I would not know of a replacement other than emacs org mode.<p>If you&#x27;re into literal programming Leo is very nice for that as well.<p>True, it&#x27;s no IDE. It&#x27;s not in the same space as Eclipse, Intellij and so on.

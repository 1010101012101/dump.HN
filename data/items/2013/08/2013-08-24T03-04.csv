There are very strange design decisions in 8. The idea that an installed program and an app store app are two totally different things to the OS is completely baffling and limits functionality.

Sure, there&#x27;s economic filters in the way of making it to places like Stanford or YC, but you can&#x27;t complain that the lessons and morals these institutions impart are somehow &#x27;racially tinged&#x27; because of socioeconomic gates inbuilt in American society.<p>If the author points out one thing correctly, it&#x27;s that there is a striking disparity between the quality of life on either side of 101 on University.

Then, in the name of improving performance, they do all kinds of things that bring down their productivity and increase the complexity of their code (choosing C++ as the programming language is one of those things), but they never verify if any of those things really made enough of a difference, if any, to create value.<p>Another thing I noticed is that of those people who do have serious performance requirements (OS kernel etc.), many choose C over C++.

Similarly, it would be absurd to define 1 mort as the combination of 1 million separate risks, each of which has a 1 in 1 million chance of killing you. Whether 1 mort is guaranteed death or 1 - 1/e chance of death (my previous mention of it being 1/e was mistaken) is a property of how we define the unit to work, not a property of how correlated 1 million separate risks happen to be.

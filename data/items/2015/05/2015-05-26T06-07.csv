9603300,comment,9600015,9602113,0,0,curiouscats,,,"There are people against copyright in principle though a very small number of people.<p>Mainly what I see is similar to using amendments to &quot;poison&quot; legislation.  The abuse at the core of the current crazy USA rules (and then the USA forcing other countries to adopt USA rules) has poisoned the merits of copyright so much that many people find the current copyright reality abhorrent.<p>Now it also isn&#x27;t the greatest comparison as the &quot;poison&quot; amendments are specifically created to exploit voting blocks to have to support the amendment that then creates legislation that can&#x27;t gain enough votes to pass.<p>And the copyright law has been created by politicians giving companies that pay them lots of money legislation they want.  There was no intent to create an unpalatable system so that people would revolt and demand change.  So far it hasn&#x27;t been so unpalatable as to cause the whole thing to collapse under the weight of poisonous amendments.  And in fact with TPP we likely to see the USA again forcing new poisonous provisions onto our vassal states.<p>But what has happened is those poisonous provision have created a large number of people that are extremely unhappy with the current state of copyright.  They just so far have been readily outmaneuvered over and over by the copyright cartel folks (as is happening with TPP, most likely, yet again).<p>It seems we might be getting close to a tipping point, but maybe not.  But in any event I think the anti-copyright talk is much more anti-the-poisonous-copyright-extentions-that-have-nearly-no-economic-justification.  I feel that way myself.  While at the same time believing sensible copyright rules (the USA constitution seems about right in spirit) are wise.  Something close to the years we originally had instead of all the extensions that have been added seems reasonable to me.  I&#x27;m sure not to others.  I feel very strongly the current rules are vastly too restrictive on moving work to the public domain and it is doing great damage to our economy as things stand now.",1432623436

9603285,comment,9599437,9599437,0,0,mkcarlos,,,"My opinions:<p>I think attempting to balance games where the number of character/choices are large enough is a futile process (especially if the design process aims at the &quot;cream of the rop&quot; players). The truth is that at the end of the day, competitions are still going to be populated with players would use the top ~20% something (depending on the game) of the character cast, with a very small minority actually bothering with the other characters due to the playing-to-win mentality. I see this pattern being very common with a lot of games, and attempts at balancing them only <i>shuffle</i> the casts around i.e. a new set of characters now dominate, replacing the old ones. Part of the reason is because the characters/game mechanics are so intricately tied to one another, a small change could flip the entire &quot;metagame&quot; around.<p>This symptom is more apparent with MOBA games such as Dota 2. After each balance patch, the game becomes chaotic enough to raise interests among players, although the metagame will eventually converge to a singular point. Players will then complain and the process continues. Each patch hardly makes the game more balanced, they just make the game different. I think at stages like this, you simply have to adopt a new definition of &quot;balance&quot;.<p>Also I disagree with &quot;Design Self-balancing Forces&quot;. While the mechanics proposed are good at creating depth for the game, I think it&#x27;s misguided to add them with balance in mind. An example is the game Street Fighter 3 (specifically the third edition, Third Strike): the designer added a &quot;parry&quot; mechanic in which allows a player (with a good guess, timing and some memorization) to counter any attack. This could be perceived as an attempt to give any character a chance, but in practice players argue that this makes the strongest characters even stronger (of course it&#x27;s hard to verify this because an identically copied game with no &quot;parry&quot; doesn&#x27;t exist) because they can counter attack for much higher damage.<p>Also, Sirlin (the author) spends a lot of his time with versus fighting games, and the article reflects that. I think if you&#x27;re looking to balance a game of another genre, it&#x27;s unlikely that his philosophies will be very useful. Just for reference, versus fighting games usually have these metrics: character pool is between 10-30 (usually don&#x27;t go up much), there&#x27;s a heavy emphasis on specialising on one character (could go up to 3), heavy emphasis on reaction and guessing, long intervals between balance patches (if there are going to be patches at all), at competitions there rarely are rules (i.e. usually no banning, save for a few games where balance is pretty bad). If you compare this to other genres (FPS, RTS, MOBA, ...) these metrics will be very, very different.",1432623121
9603284,comment,9601770,9603027,0,0,ahelwer,,,"There is a difference between formal specification and formal verification. Formal specification is what we have with TLA+: you create a high-level description of your system, to which you apply software tools to check the design. It&#x27;s like blueprints for software.<p>Formal verification deals with proving that the actual code you write implements a formal specification. This is a much, much harder problem. Usually, it involves cajoling a theorem prover by adding lots of annotations to your code. There&#x27;s been some impressive work with the Ironclad project from MSR[1] which brought this down to ~5 lines of annotation per single line of implementation code - within striking distance of unit testing! Still, probably a decade or more away from widespread use.<p>Formal verification isn&#x27;t quite what you meant, though. You were talking about code generation. For general systems specified by TLA+, this isn&#x27;t going to be useful unless you write in a very idiomatic way; in which case TLA+ is just a very high-level programming language. However, code generation <i>is</i> implemented in some specification languages that deal with very specific areas of system design. I&#x27;m thinking primarily of the P language[2], which is used to specify & check state machines and includes code generation capabilities for C++ and C#.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi14/technical-sessions/presentation/hawblitzel"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi14/technical-sessions/...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=177118"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=1771...</a>",1432623088

9603280,comment,9601651,9601651,0,0,Quequau,,,"I was pretty enthusiastic about Adapteva&#x27;s kickstarter for their Parallella board, even though I felt like some of the wording they had was a bit deceptive.  I began to sign on for the 64 core version but I backed out because I got burned by another Kickstarter project around the same time it began to become clear they weren&#x27;t really going to make it to the funding level they needed for the 64 core version.<p>I forget how long that&#x27;s been but I have to admit to be being really disappointed that there hasn&#x27;t been much demonstrable progress.  There&#x27;s still no 64-core version of the Parallella board.  There was some talk about an update to 16-core Parallella board but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s shipped. As far as I know there&#x27;s still no way to connect multiple Parallella boards using their &quot;e-Link&quot; ports. And lastly no way to assemble a small Adapteva cluster with a more favorable ratio between the Adapteva and Zynq (as far as power, heat and money go) than a stack of the 16-core Parallella boards.<p>Obviously I expected too much and I guess I&#x27;m being a tad unfair.  That I&#x27;ve seen the dev team have always been decent, reasonable, and polite; so I really hate to write anything negative at all.  I just thought they&#x27;d be much further along by now and that I might have a mini many-core cluster.",1432623046

Nowadays, it&#x27;s just a matter of putting some configuration lines into PHP-FPM config and it works like a charm (at least for me, you might have a special site, idk).<p>Yes, compiling PHP shouldn&#x27;t take that much (even though typical WordPress site consists of thousands of PHP files). But as you can see from some of the charts from my work, it can potentially double the amount of concurrent requests the server is able to respond to.<p>Whole page caching (I call it page cache) is the biggest improvement one can make. However, instead of using WP plugins, in my work I configured Nginx to cache the output of PHP interpreter (FastCGI). The advantages are that you can use Nginx&#x27;s location directives to bypass the cache early (e.g. logged in users, shopping cart, etc) and that Nginx stores the pages in RAM in a tree-like structure with pretty fast access times. In a heavy WP site (plenty of large plugins, etc), you can go from 200 concurrent requests at 8 seconds to 1000 concurrent requests at 2 seconds, which is a pretty huge improvement.<p>MySQL query caching should definitely help, though in my testing it did not. Maybe I need a real benchmark with a real 100 people requesting different subpages. Then the DB (MariaDB in my case) might become a bottleneck.<p>Yeah, SSDs are superb-useful, in any cases. I made all the tests on a non-SSD server. At least the WordPress DB structure is quite flexible, though, as you mentioned, it now suffers from the gigantic joins.<p>Bad plugins and themes are the root of all the performance problems. But sometimes it is easier to implement caching and replacing Apache with Nginx on the server side than replacing plugins that you really need. That&#x27;s the main point of the thesis: Time of an experienced developer fixing plugins and themes is more expensive than optimizing the server. But yeah, if you are a developer, learning to write clean and fast plugins is crucial.",1432621157

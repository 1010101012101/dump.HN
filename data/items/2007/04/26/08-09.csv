You were brave to put yourself out there and solicit feedback, it was very respectable and ballsy. But you did a very poor job of accepting the <i>honest</i> criticism (that <i>you</i> solicited) gracefully.<p>Your outbursts are disruptive and you shouldn't be surprised that people don't enjoy being disrupted.

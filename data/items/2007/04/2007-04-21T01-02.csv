This involves mainly human judgement & all in 48 hrs & it doesn't scale. No refs as search is useless.

15314,comment,15263,15263,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Some good groups were there today.  Most of the ideas are solid and the teams seemed pretty smart.  Of course, in some cases, I don't believe a two or three man team could possibly pull it off...or even get to a prototype in 3 months with 15-20k.  That's something to be cautious of...over-reaching is far more likely to kill you than being too humble about what you can achieve.

15312,comment,15144,15144,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Our company is among the oldest, if not the oldest, funded by YC with 32 and 33 year old founders.  We are both hackers.  I learned today that Joe Hewitt is getting close to 30 (and he thought he was the oldest of the bunch before today).<p>Also, Paul has mentioned several times in the past that the mean age of the companies they fund is climbing, and he's thinking 24-ish is the right age to start thinking seriously about a startup (finished school, had a real job for a while, so you know how much it sucks to work for someone else).<p>Most of the founders who were in WFP2007 are hackers.  Some are more hackery than others (it's a quite wide range...some are famously good hackers, while others have only picked up a programming language, probably PHP, in the past year or two).  But, even the ones that aren't hackers by nature have become hackers, to some degree, during the program...in this early stage, it's the biggest part of the work that needs to be done.  When you have a launched product, the job becomes more diverse and other skills become as important as hacking, but before that, if you aren't able to contribute code or design, you're probably not serving your team very well.",1177119520

It works pretty well for low traffic web sites, but the VM's need to have a real hardware NTP server to keep their clocks syncronized.  I also run NFS on real hardware.  It works surprisingly well.  Watch how you allocate VM disk I/O across your physical disk spindles.  I have three physical drives plugged into the mini.",1177119024

But, here are my (personal) feature requests:<p>- Give us a way to send feedback without spamming the home page! (like I am...)<p>- Add user comments to the RSS feed<p>- Allow member-to-member messaging<p>- Search box?? Yes, I know ""site:news.ycombinator.com"" on google usually works, but a built-in search would be better.  This would reduce the number of duplicate threads, since we could search before submitting.<p>- Voting history?  I upvote useful links, then months later forget the URLs when I need them <p>What does everyone else think?  Any other feature requests not previously mentioned?",1177118737

15302,comment,15186,15186,0,0,zaphod,,,"Being self-taught, I would suggest 3 things.  <p>My first suggestion is to take a course in a programming langauge at a local college.  Learning a language, any language, will start you off faster than struggling with it on your own.  C# or VB.NET are non-intimidating and taught everywhere as they're the workhorse languages in many microsoft-based IT shops.   They're not cool and hackerish, but have the instant gratification of easy GUI building which is helpful to beginners, and you can avoid memory management which is very intimidating to beginners.  They're also taught EVERYWHERE so even in East Chucka, someone will have these courses in some format.  Appreciation for the finer things (ruby and dynamic languages) is more clear when you've seen how the other half lives.  Also, if you learn one of these languages, you can possibly get a QA or support job to pay for more classes.  Lisp, Ruby and and Scheme are cool, but won't pay the bills while you learn.<p>The next thing I'd suggest is to come up with an idea for something you're passionate about creating, and learn the technologies you need to make it as you go.  Having a project you're excited about is the difference between being hungry for a technology and choking it down like a cold piece of liver.<p>And finally, as the other posts mentioned, get the pragmatic programmers book when you're ready to learn ruby.  I'd suggest starting with a Ruby course, but I'm not sure they exist on any wide-scale.  Remember though, that book is focused on the framework, not the ruby language.  Once you know how to code, you'll be all set.<p><p>

For example:<p>""I've thought a lot about that. I would be surprised if current spam filters could work unchanged. There are not enough trolls on News.YC to make it worth investing time in trying to write it in Lisp, but it would be an interesting experiment to see if you could use C++ programming techniques to detect trolls in some large public corpus like Digg or Reddit or Slashdot's comment threads.""",1203242326

117480,comment,117294,117299,4,0,robg,,,"Research could also involve independent study courses and/or an honor's thesis. The latter could take two years to complete, but when you go to apply for grad schools it's something you've completed based on your interests and drive. It's the perfect example of completing something that grad school will require. You will have formed a committee, presented your ideas, executed a plan of work, and defended the results. It's practice for grad school because it's a mini-version of it.<p>Independent study courses are a great way to explore your interests more intensively especially as you get ready to do your own work. If you're working on research with a professor, some schools will allow you to get credit in this form. Or you could simply do more focused reading with a professor and get credit for it. One of my best experiences as an undergrad was an independent study with two profs (philosophy and psychology) to talk weekly about mind and brain issues. I needed to know them to see if it would fly, and I organized the reading list with their input, but afterwards it functioned as a normal course with me as the only student.<p>Through a thesis committee and independent study courses, you'll also get to know professors for those all-important letters of recommendation (as Paul recommends). For those, it's better to know 6 profs well so you can then pick the ones that know you and can best speak highly of you. In a class, especially one with more than ten students it's very hard for a prof to see how you stand out. Better to start working more with them directly. Then they'll have much more to write about. In a similar vein, take small seminar classes wherever and as early as possible. That's a straight-forward way to get to know profs (to see who you want to work with or have on a committee) and for them to get to know you.<p>Also, find ways to go to other schools during the summers to conduct research more in line with your interests and to be surrounded by like minded peers. Schools have programs that will pay you a little bit and put you up in a dorm. If you research those programs quickly, you could find something for as soon as this summer.",1203239434

This isn't just true of the stock market, but also in every aspect of life.<p>I do agree that if you pick an actively managed fund picking one with good past performance is safer than one with poor past performance.<p>My money will still be heading into index funds.",1203343158

These are questions for action.<p>I'm having trouble seeing how one could design a pumping system so poor that it's cheaper to ship water via truck in miniature plastic bottles produced in industrial parks on average thousands of miles away. Even an Archimedes screw is close to optimal energy efficiency if you have a gear system.",1203341997
118099,comment,117938,117947,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Agreed.<p>Let's say you post an amazingly funny technology joke and picture each day, and a friend posts an amazing, in-depth discussion of something that most of the readers would want to consume.<p>Who do you think is going to score all the points? Certainly not your friend with the in-depth articles.<p>So does that mean the the community is more represented by people who post quick, funny barbs? Are we a group of late-night technology comedians?<p>I understand the joke analogy is at the extreme, but you can make the same observation comparing, say, 3-paragraph gossipy blog entries with 50-paragraph in-depth articles. Same principle applies.",1203341499

118097,comment,117646,118038,0,0,Electro,,,"CO2 is irrelevant, even if production is switched to biodegradeable plant-based oils and shipping is done over short distance with a renewable energy source, people will still complain about bottled water.<p>They complained before global warming was even thought about, and they're just using fantasy CO2 statistics to bolster their claims. In fact, in some areas with low access to water, governments spend millions merely pumping water up elevations. I know where I live they have to do it, and we're only slightly up hill from the supplier. I wonder how much CO2 they're putting into the atmosphere by using vast quantities of power to pump water up a gradient, which is less efficient than merely moving it.",1203340456
118096,comment,117598,117598,0,0,willarson,,,"This is a topic that used to bother me before I graduated and left academia behind. When I attended a private middle and lower school, parents would call my mother and ask her how she completed the current project. The level of penetration of this practice was such that it was assumed that the parents would do their children's work. And this was for students younger than 14.<p>Did any of that work actually matter? Probably not, but the  parents felt strongly enough about it to spend hours writing 4th grade reports on Gettysburg or the Cherokee Indian tribe.<p>With parents willing to go that far, I don't think its surprising that they're shelling out so much money for admissions editors or are writing the essays for their children.<p>Really, though, I think its just symbolic of how far the American education system has strayed from its imagined mandate to educate. Children don't learn how to write or research when they are thusly coddled, and they don't learn how to deal with new and challenging situations when their parents go along for their first job interviews and browbeat the interviewers.<p>I think that these misguided parents are elongating childhood in a society where childhood already lasts longer than it ever has before, and are stunting their children in their efforts to give them a foothold above their peers. These parents won't be thwarted by reason, and will find some other mechanism to 'help' their kids advance. I don't think trying to neutralize them will ever be a good investment of one's time.",1203340341

I'll also eat more healthily, get more greens in me and protein; thus producing more methane which is 25 times worse than CO2 emissions.<p>Also, for when I do need to drive, I'll switch to a hybrid. However, that requires a large amount of lead and acids that are extremely harmful to the environment and it also takes more energy to produce an hybrid car than is actually saved in the average use of the car.<p>I will personally help destroy the environment by doing EVERYTHING I've been told should SAVE IT.

I&#x27;m curious because I see stuff like this all the time being submitted to YC.<p>For example, is this for IT / DBAs that need to gather info for data analysts, marketers and sales people? Are there many people in that position and what would the ideal flow look like? I can see startups and small companies willing to use this as a stopgap, but I couldn&#x27;t imagine larger customers/companies willing to use something like this.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say I don&#x27;t know why this was built. The same forces are what drove us to build Wufoo. We were tired of building these tedious data collection apps. The DIY builder was out of laziness on our part.<p>But when it comes to accessing existing data, there&#x27;s so many concerns about security and privacy that I worry an idea like this will always be limited in terms of adoption.<p>If people think differently, I would love to know.",1434751186

Promises are good for solving asynchronous operations such as querying a service with an XMLHttpRequest, where the expected behavior is one value and then completion. The Reactive Extensions for JavaScript unifies both the world of Promises, callbacks as well as evented data such as DOM Input, Web Workers, Web Sockets.

9747895,comment,9746960,9746960,0,0,grellas,,,"Back in the day, a C&D was a private affair. As a lawyer, you would give someone the big blast and, right or wrong, you could not really embarrass your client because you were basically writing to an audience of one. Today, if you screw up on the law or are tone-deaf in how you say things, you and particularly your client will find yourselves on public display as potential objects of ridicule. That is what happened here.<p>Writing a good C&D is an art and it is amazing how much more effective something can be if it communicates truly and well without taking on a needlessly stiff and formal tone. Because, in the end, there is always a purpose behind these things. Trademarks are intended to protect brand origin and if someone who is not the brand owner makes misleading use of a mark to palm off the phony for the real, well, people can understand that and even sympathize with the plight of anyone who has felt ripped off in that way. The art lies in being able to make the legal points without sounding like a bully or an ass. It can be and is done every day when people who are truly infringers do things wrong and find themselves getting slammed. But those C&Ds tend not to find their way into public view.<p>Here, the C&D was absurdly wrong on the law and tone deaf to boot. Kudos to the IMAX and Ars execs for finding a way to handle the thing in the end as a class act and not as a low-brow fight. Speaking even as a lawyer, it is really nice to see.",1434750836

Please see Nominative Use (alt: &quot;Nominative Fair Use&quot;), which an affirmative defense that basically boils down to a party being directly allowed to make a competitive comparison between their product/service and another trademarked product/service. This looks like about as textbook a case as it gets too. First, here is the quote:<p><i>&quot;It’s like saying, &#x27;I have an IMAX theater in my house,&#x27;&quot; he told Machkovech. &quot;It’s so much better that we can get away with a cumbersome setup.&quot;</i><p>To satisfy Nominative Use:<p>- Only the minimum amount of the mark necessary can be used, which is certainly the case here, it&#x27;s just the plain text mark &quot;IMAX&quot; and not the special logo or font or whatever.<p>- Can&#x27;t suggest any sponsorship. Also satisfied here, his comparison in no way suggests that IMAX Corporation endorses SteamVR.<p>- The product/service being compared has to be uniquely identified by the trademark, which is definitely the case here (&quot;IMAX&quot; names a unique technology/experience).<p>A trademark is for preventing consumer confusion around a specific product/service, not to control all speech, opinions, and competition regarding said product/service. Genericization is an entirely different process. He&#x27;s not using &quot;IMAX&quot; to refer to VR in general (or at all), he&#x27;s saying &quot;My SteamVR product is competitive with/superior to the IMAX(TM) Experience&quot; which is entirely permissible and indeed critical for a functioning market. IMAX Corp could of course argue that no, &quot;SteamVR sux IMAX rox&quot; without infringing on his trademark either.",1434750803

Then the first battle was: what the hell do you mean? I started reading. I read Grassmann, for example, and Grassmann was saying that mathematics was not about things in space and time, but it was about thought–it was about the order of thought. And he obtained his Grassmann algebra from that kind of consideration. And I read Clifford‘s original books, original papers, and it was all about process. Two times three is equal to six–it’s not two objects times three. It’s the doubling of three objects. It’s a process.&quot;<p>This is the key idea behind category theory, that equality is an arrow (a process). I think this neatly summarizes why I suck at algebra. I write code, my brain works in algorithms & processes. 1+1=2 just doesn&#x27;t parse. If I can convert whatever mathematical concept into an algorithm then yeah I get it.

A lot of the messaging, hype and marketing conflates the 2 and it suits the docker ecosystem to do that but it does not benefit informed discussion.<p>By eschewing plain containers in favour of Docker you are embracing some complexity and it would help to have more discussions on the tradeoff and benefits of every approach, rather than just conflating containers to Docker.<p>The LXC project in development since 2009 on which Docker was based and now Systemd-nspawn give you pretty advanced containers with mature management tools, multiple container OSs, full stack linux networking, storage options, cloning, snapshotting etc. [1]<p>LXC and soon Systemd-nspawn (version 220) support unprivileged containers [2] that let&#x27;s non root users run containers. That&#x27;s a pretty big step forward for container security.<p>There is lot of innovation happening outside the hype of Docker. But these projects are not opinionated and stop at giving you container technology as lightweight VMs like KVM, Xen, Vmware stop at giving you virtualization.<p>Docker takes that as a base and restricts the container OS template to a single app, builds the container as layers using aufs, btrfs, device mapper, and enforces storage separation. This is not rocket science, you can do this yourself with overlayfs, aufs, btrfs, build single app containers etc [3]<p>By adopting the Docker way you are immediately taking away seamless migration of VM workloads and embracing some complexity. There are both upsides and downsides to this. For a lot of use cases the Docker approach may help, in others it may add unnecessary complexity. We have an indepth [4] look at the differences between LXC and Docker here for those who are interested.<p>Disclosure I run flockport.com that provides an app store for servers based on Linux containers.<p>[1] <a href=""https://flockport.com/guides"" rel=""nofollow"">https://flockport.com/guides</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.flockport.com/lxc-using-unprivileged-containers/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.flockport.com/lxc-using-unprivileged-containers/</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.flockport.com/experimenting-with-overlayfs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.flockport.com/experimenting-with-overlayfs</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://www.flockport.com/lxc-vs-docker"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.flockport.com/lxc-vs-docker</a>",1434750368

Let me try again from a different angle: It&#x27;s up to an API designer to come up with a sane API, including sane usage of futures/promises only where it makes sense.<p>In the browser world, futures or promises are an abstraction over some operation that doesn&#x27;t block the UI thread, and therefore can allow some other work to happen in the meantime. In your example, if Pending and Completed provide an interface to some remote API, then a lock provides no benefit because making separate RPCs can&#x27;t possibly be atomic anyway. If they&#x27;re operating on local data or the DOM, then making them return futures is pointless because the work will happen on the same thread, and no other code could possibly observe the intermediate state anyway. (This is a core principle of the browser event loop: Javascript code is never preempted, it can only yield control by running to completion. Apologies if I&#x27;m repeating stuff you already know.)<p>In other languages, futures are more flexible because they can contain CPU-bound work that operates on shared memory. In that case, futures don&#x27;t magically absolve you of the need to protect that shared memory. But if you have multiple operations on the same shared data, it once again doesn&#x27;t normally make sense to decouple them with futures in the first place.",1434749121

Accomplishing this 1:1 mapping means locking the view into a single position.  If you allow me to look around, then as soon as I turn my head, the angle skews and you&#x27;re not mapping 1:1 any more.<p>> <i>So now instead of 1:1 you might be 1:4, and you&#x27;re seeing 25% of the video&#x27;s original detail actually rendered on the VR headset&#x27;s display.</i><p>If 1:1 looks good, then 1:4 rendered 4 times as far away looks exactly as good.  If you can&#x27;t see the pixels at 1:1 then you can&#x27;t see the lost detail at 1:4.  If you <i>could</i> see the lost detail at 1:4, it would mean the 1:1 image looks pixelated. Again, your physical display doesn&#x27;t care about how far away something is rendered.  It has a fixed resolution, and if it&#x27;s too low to be convincing, it&#x27;s too low to be convincing at any rendered distance.<p>Go play an N64 game (or find some screenshots).  You&#x27;ll see that everything in the foreground is pretty rough looking.  Everything in the background is equally rough looking, because rendered distance doesn&#x27;t change the display resolution.<p>> <i>Now zoom out, and again, and again. Detail has been lost. First a little, then a lot, and as you go too far back substantial amounts have been.</i><p>This doesn&#x27;t matter.  If it looks good at 1:1, then it will look good at 1:4.  If it doesn&#x27;t look good at 1:4, it didn&#x27;t look good at 1:1.  The lost detail is irrelevant.<p>> <i>In order to play back a 1080p video on a 1080p VR headset...</i><p>I&#x27;m pretty sure you just can&#x27;t do this convincingly, no matter the &quot;zoom&quot; level.

You don&#x27;t.  You need a display with sufficient resolution to be convincing to your eyes.  Once you have that, you can render your virtual 1080p image at any distance that would work in the real world and not care about how pixels are mapping.",1434748464

It looks to me as if it&#x27;s saying that Clifford algebras give a better way of writing Maxwell&#x27;s equations (all four of them) as a single equation with no cross products (as such) at all.<p>You combine the current j and charge density rho into a single four-vector current J; you combine the electric field E and magnetic field B into a single bivector F. (In spacetime, not just space, so the space of bivectors has dimension (4 choose 2) = 6 = 3+3, which is the right amount for representing E and B.) Then the Clifford-algebra analogue of the &quot;del&quot; operator from conventional vector calculus does div-like things and curl-like things in the right combination to encode all of the Maxwell equations.<p>Of course, you can do more or less the same thing without calling it Clifford algebra (or geometric algebra) and you can find it done in physics textbooks. Usually this means a whole lot of tensor formulae; see e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariant_formulation_of_classical_electromagnetism#Maxwell.27s_equations_in_vacuum"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariant_formulation_of_class...</a>.

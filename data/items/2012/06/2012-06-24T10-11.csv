In this sense, the amyloidosis was ""transmitted"".<p>The prion-like behavior mentioned is the ability of prions to do something similar. Specifically, a small amount of abnormal prion protein can induce a larger amount to also become abnormal (with respect to it's shape).  The process is analogous to crystallization, where small crystal can seed the creation of a larger one.<p>In the field, the significance of this is that small initial abnormal events can trigger larger ones within the brain, a bit like the famous butterfly analogy in chaos theory.",1340535069

4153050,comment,4151402,4151402,5,0,Gussy,,,"I find how this is now all playing out to be quite interesting, and a little amusing:<p>A few years back when there was really only one prominent open source UAV system (Paparazzi), nearly everyone was focused on turning (fixed-wing) radio-controlled planes into hobby UAVs. Back then we didn't have gyros or accelerometers, we used thermopiles to detect the heat difference between warm ground and the cold atmosphere on four axis. This worked well until it became night time or started raining, and required a baseline calibration before most flights.<p>When projects like OpenPilot and Ardupilot (aka. DIYDrones/3DRobotics) first started to appear they were focused on building UAV systems for planes with this same technology, multi-rotor vehicles where only just on the radar at that stage. They were expensive and to be frank, not very good at flying stable. Then game consoles like the Wii came along and over the next few years gyros and accelerometers started to become much cheaper.<p>OpenPilot and DIYDrones/3DRobotics initially started out developing with these new gyros and accelerometers in planes, but it wasn't really the right platform as planes tend to me more costly and fragile in a crash, which is inevitable when developing with these new technologies. OpenPilot initially started to adapt their system to multi-rotors (aka. quadcopters) as a way of quickly testing new code and new algorithms for planes. Unlike planes we could even now test code indoors.<p>Quad-copters started out as a utility, to lift heavy items or as a test-bed for fixed-win UAV algorithms. From there they have now become the first class citizen in the world of open source and hobby UAV projects.<p>I think this is all really just starting to ramp up. The hardware we need to build these systems is pretty much all there, it can get faster, smaller and cheaper but innovation there is nearing a plateau. On the other hand, I think software is still very much in it's infancy. There is still a long way to go in making these systems reliable and repeatable, and most importantly user friendly. We have progressed from having to re-compile under linux to change one PID setting value, but the barrier to entry is still quite high on the technical side of things.<p>Disclaimer: Co-Founder of the OpenPilot project.",1340532933

That happened because Scandinavian farming had gotten the population to get too big. You run out of reliable fishing sources long before you hit the grains maximum. You don't have to replace fish with grains, just introducing grains to the diet can increase risk of malnutrition.<p>On the contrary this explains nicely how Sami people can be darker than Germans. They lived of reindeer, bird trapping and fishing, even like hundred years ago. It explains why Finnish are somewhat darker than swedes, we relied on hunting and fishing far longer than Swedes did.",1340532568

Far better to just cut off API access and be done with. It's not like Dropbox's business model depends on the availability of anonymous torrent downloads and the people who want that. 
Possibly the opposite, in fact.",1340532488

He has an example of a modern experiment where people select brunettes over blondes because of rarity.<p>So if european whiteness is a product of sexual selection of rare blondes, why didn't it swing the other way when the majority of the population were blonde? In some parts of Sweden and Finland, 85% of the adults are blonde, how could it ever go way above 50%? If the hypothesis was true, then people in those areas would have strongly selected brunettes and reversed it?",1340532366
